"How'd things go yesterday?"
 was the greeting he got at exactly 8:47 Monday morning.
 "Fine.
 I read and napped, watched a little TV.
 I'm all rested up."
 Ted dropped into the chair in front of Rick's desk.
 "What are you talking about?
 Sharon told Lauri that you guys went out."
 "We did."
 "Then what's all this business about resting?

Not a true celebration for most; as their lord and master, ‚Äòhe‚Äô was more feared than loved.
 Rodregas locked the door to prevent a surprise.
 He should have done that before; it was sloppy of him not to take such a simple precaution.
 Asking Captain Poir to send up Adapt Korin had been totally unplanned.
 He had been dreaming of killing Korin for all the 18 years that he had served in the tower.
 The Sorcerer Ravenhurr had been an immoral monster that used those around him for his own selfish desires.
 But Adapt Korin was of a more casual evil; he never passed up the opportunity to hurt those around him, physically or emotionally.
 Ravenhurr had existed in the same body for the full eighteen years of Rodregas‚Äô service, and was hundreds of years old.
 In all his years serving in the tower Ravenhurr had only tried to hold the ceremony three times, each time abandoning the attempt due to the lack of a celestial animal.
 A celestial animal was extremely rare, but required as part of the ceremony for Ravenhurr‚Äôs next step up in power.

The dwarf seemed to bounce up and down.
 ‚ÄúIt has sir, but I don‚Äôt know what her majesty did.
 All I know is that all of you have to go home to get ready.‚Äù My mind whirled with all this new information.
 ‚ÄúWait, why do we have to go?

 ‚ÄúAll of you must free our world from darkness, from him.‚Äù *** Seth and I walked back to our clearing, both our brains not thinking.

 Qurrah shrugged, glancing down the vacant street in search of victims.

‚ÄúNot to ask a dumb question,‚Äù Rodregas asked in a curious tone ‚Äúbut who is Gerald?‚Äù  Silence followed his query but finally he got an answer.
 ‚ÄúHe is the man that you appear to be, whose body you now‚Ä¶ have,‚Äù responded the maiden.
 ‚ÄúAnd what are you five named?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 There was a pause at his question.
 He knew this was an important moment because once people say who they are they are much less likely to do violence.
 Rodregas did not understand the reason, but he knew that to be true.
 ‚ÄúI am Imeralda,‚Äù said the AElf maiden.
 Then came the Hellborn, ‚ÄúMy name is Doi‚Äôvanaomeraldioan, but humans usually call me Doi‚Äôvan,‚Äù he stated in a slow careful way in a very deep, deep voice.
 The leader, after a pause, said, ‚ÄúI am Audrian of family Corin.‚Äù The other two men identified themselves as Brit and Geor.

Cowering in a corner was never a good strategy as the crowd only pushed you back to the center.
 The room erupted when the action was good and the fights were a scrappy version of actual boxing.
 The fight was over when you surrendered or you were knocked out.
 I fought many times and I do not remember ever losing.
 As I said, I had grown up facing a much tougher opponent than anyone in the room.
 I was rarely injured because I had learned to protect myself from the powerful blows of my stepfather and I knew how to look for an opening and drop my opponent.
 By this time I was close to six feet tall and about 175 pounds.
 I was in great shape and I had endured physical punishment as training.
 Drag racing wasn‚Äôt easy on a car, and since we were constantly racing, constantly striving to make the Chevelle faster, inevitably something was always broken.
 Hitchhiking to and from work became a regular event, and I often got rides from the same people every afternoon.

Democracies can only thrive and the revolution of rising expectations can only fulfil itself peacefully, when economic opportunities are provided to every human being.
 The recent rise of the political right, ethnic unrest and opposition to immigration in Western Europe, and the surge of crime in the United States, are sufficient evidence of the corrosive impact that unemployment can have, even on mature democracies.
 Increasingly, those excluded from the benefits of modern society reject its standards of justice and ignore its laws.
 The end of the ideological confrontation between capitalism and communism leaves the market system exposed at its weakest point ‚Äì its impersonality and insensitivity to human needs and suffering ‚Äì with no longer any lesser alternative to point at in self-justification.
 Having rejected the inadequacies and abuses of authoritarian socialism as a solution, we are compelled to find other methods to achieve social equity.
 In the present context, employment is the most effective way to distribute the fruits of development among people.
 The world is now capable of producing sufficient food and other basic necessities to feed, clothe and house everyone; but without opportunities for employment, people lack the purchasing power needed to buy them.
 Economic entitlement, rather than a shortage of food or food production capacity, is the key to global food security.
 Lack of employment opportunities is also directly linked to destruction of the environment, both rural and urban.
 The destruction of tropical rain forests has been one result.

 But what I had read so far was much more horrifying than I‚Äôd expected.
 I didn‚Äôt want to continue.
 How could I have been so stupid as to forget it was my mother who had destroyed the northern clans, taken the families from everyone I knew?
 As they stood protecting me, the betrayal I‚Äôd felt before was gone.
 In its place was a new hurt, a heart-rending sorrow.
 They heard my sobs.
 I was aware of their eyes on me before they uncomfortably turned away again.
 Chevelle approached me warily as I lay curled in a ball on my blankets, the book positioned in front of me.
 He tossed it aside but I no longer cared.

The system of education prevalent in most developing countries is oriented toward the outer form ‚Äì acquiring a degree or qualifying certificate ‚Äì rather than the inner content of knowledge.
 Educated unemployment is a direct result of a system that fosters obedience and rote learning rather than individual initiative and creative thinking.
 A new system of development education needs to be introduced at all levels to equip the student with an understanding of his/her society, its achievements and potentials, and the opportunities open to each individual to participate in its future growth.
 The index of its success will be the extent to which students of this curriculum seek self-employment rather than salaried jobs.
 Fifth, minimum and average educational levels should be raised in all countries.
 Two centuries ago education was a luxury of the rich and it was simply inconceivable that every member of the population in any country could receive even a minimum level of education.
 Few of the industrial nations fully meet their own present minimum standards for every citizen.
 These minimums are arbitrary, not optimal.
 Raising the minimum levels of achievement further in all countries may be the most important initiative that governments can render to prepare their citizens for a more productive, prosperous and peaceful future.
 Sixth, new educational systems must be evolved to prepare people for life in the twenty-first century.

‚ÄúVery well,‚Äù Harruq said.
 He tried to follow but the pain in his side stopped him.
 He clutched his bleeding side and breathed deeply.
 His armor had saved him, but the elf had managed to penetrate deeper than he thought.

 It was there that the bulk of combat had spread.

"Not that I'm complaining, mind you, but why the sudden change?"
 Alec gave me a lopsided smile of his own.
 "My death is nearly certain, but there's always a chance I'll somehow survive.
 As unlikely as that is, I don't want to survive and then find I've poisoned you against me.
 I won't stop you."
 I felt things I hadn't realized were knotted up relax inside me.
 When my voice finally came out it was smaller than normal.
 "Thank you."
 Alec shrugged and gave me another smile.

 He closed his eyes, his hands stretched to either side.
 His fingers hooked and curled in strange ways, many times so twisted and odd that Harruq could not bear to watch them dance.
 Words spilled from the frail half-orc‚Äôs lips.
 Some were strong, demanding, while others came limping out, twisted in form and barely existing as they were meant to exist.
 The words, however, did not matter as much as the dark power rolling forth from Qurrah.
 His sheer will would determine the full strength of the spell.
 A cold wind came blasting in, seemingly from all directions.

Her mother nodded.
 "When I was 17, I met a young man named Andrew.
 I was staying with my aunt on Martha's Vineyard for the summer, and his family had a cottage not far from my aunt's.
 He was a student at Harvard during the year, and he was planning to be a doctor.
 We were inseparable from the moment we met.
 We went out to dinner, went to parties, sometimes just sat quietly reading together.
 But best of all, we would walk or sit on the beach for hours talking.
 He was wonderful, and I loved him with all my heart."
 She paused, smiling as she reached out to touch a lock of Marie's hair.
 "Every time we kissed, I felt it all over."

I didn‚Äôt even realize I was falling until Chevelle‚Äôs arms were around me; he was quick, catching me before the rocks did.
 He was kneeling, cradling me in one arm as my back rested against his leg.

 I thought‚Ä¶ how could you not know?‚Äù Humiliation flooded through me.
 He was right, and not only had I wished her to choke, I had been too much a fool to see I had caused it, just as I had caused the speaker to choke.
 I squeezed my eyes closed tight in misery, rolling away from him to curl onto a rock.
 He let me, stepping away to unsaddle the horses and settle onto a seat of his own.
 We were both still until nightfall, when he retrieved a blanket from the pack and laid it over me.
 I didn‚Äôt thank him, fearing what would come out if I spoke.

 Imeralda reached out to Rodregas first to try to get him to calm down and help manage Doi‚Äôvan.

The air was still as he inclined his head toward Chevelle and then turned, a long, dark braid whipping behind him as he disappeared into the brush.
 This seemed to mean something to the group, something like relief.
 I stared after him, but Anvil stepped forward, thumping his balled fist against his chest in a gesture I didn‚Äôt understand.
 Grey followed, repeating the action and adding a single nod, and Ruby clasped her hands, bouncing excitedly from heel to toe.
 I felt myself drawing back together, tied by the knots in my stomach and mind.
 A tandem wolf howl sounded in the distance.
 My stomach swam in unease.

Per capita meat production is expected to grow by 60 per cent and milk production by 20 per cent.
 During the same period, malnutrition is projected to decline to 640 million persons, constituting 11.6 per cent of the population of developing countries, a little over half the level in 1990.
 Yet the achievements have not been uniform throughout the developing world.
 Per capita food production has actually declined in more than half of all developing countries over the past 15 years.
 In 18 countries with high rates of population growth, primarily in Africa, it has been deteriorating for the past three decades.
 While the Near East, North Africa, East Asia and Latin America/Caribbean regions are expected to achieve average food supplies of 3,000 calories per day by 2010, 200 million people will still be malnourished in South Asia and 300 million, or one-third of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, will suffer from severe food deficits.
 Due to rapidly expanding population, agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa would have to grow at four per cent annually in order significantly to improve per capita availability of food.
 Thus far, only East Asia has sustained such high growth rates in agriculture, averaging 6.1 per cent from 1970 to 1990.
 This trend, if not halted and reversed, casts a renewed spell of gloom over the hopes of hundreds of millions of people to escape from hunger, and over all our hopes for peace in the twenty-first century.
 The projection of future prospects based on past trends is especially questionable with regard to food.

 You can stay with him or go with me.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stay.‚Äù I listened to her footsteps recede.
 When I was sure she was gone I slipped the book into my pack and hid it inside the material of the white gown.

Rodregas stepped out of his room which, unlike a normal room in a human house opened directly outside.
 He ducked under a branch and bolted through the two trees and through a bush and to the door to Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs room.
 Doi‚Äôvan was standing up, his walking stick up ready to fight at Rodregas‚Äô bellow.
 ‚ÄúWhat alarms you?‚Äù he asked.
 He seemed to be listening for attack.
 ‚ÄúThese bastards are trying to take our armor and swords!
 We nearly died because it was the right thing to do to rescue the Nymphs, especially with the children being part of the caravan.‚Äù Rodregas added in a growl, ‚ÄúThere were probably Dire steeds as well.‚Äù ‚ÄúBy the Infernal Daemons, I might be as strong as a Celestial Lion, but we are going to get chopped to little pieces until we have decent armor and weapons.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut why would they keep the armor?‚Äù growled Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúThese people do not seem to be warriors.
 What good would it do them?‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan tossed his wild black mane of hair and his eyes lighted with rage.
 Rodregas suddenly realized that he better not feed the Hellborn‚Äôs rage.

It was spinning but not grabbing onto anything, so nothing was happening.
 Cassie picked me up with one hand and gave me a hard shove back towards the road.
 I almost fell.
 Considering just how rugged the terrain was, it was a good thing I didn't, because I probably would've broken my neck.
 It was still a near thing, but once I was moving reflex kept me headed in the right direction.
 Tears were flowing freely down my cheeks, and my heart seemed to be missing every second beat, almost like a hole had been torn in it and now it was a battle to continue beating, when it just wanted to quit.
 I did fall down when I hit the first slope.
 There was just enough moonlight to confirm that the pain in my hands and elbow was the result of having all of the skin abraded away.
 I thought I was going to pass out, or maybe throw up, but I couldn't cry any harder than I already was.
 Part of me kept expecting Brandon to come running towards me from the direction of the party.

He is often compared to courtly though dipsomaniacal photographer Bill Eggleston, a friend of Buddy‚Äôs from those acme days.
 The cover photograph of Black Lung‚Äôs Pepper Records album, Turntable Poison, is an unaccredited Eggleston photograph.
 (It is, of course, a weathered Sinclair sign, imbued with the enchantment Mr. Eggleston brought to all his work, a divergence quite inexplicable.)
 Buddy was loved, revered.
 He was not held to the same rules as everyone else.
 So it goes with the great.
 And when Buddy started using drugs, mixing bennies, reds and laxatives in dangerous quantities, no one was there to question him.
 Of course, drugs were part of the scene then.
 They were everywhere.
 In the back of every minibus, in the bathroom of every nightclub, at practice sessions, in the homes of every groupie.

 ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù I replied cautiously.

 She had triggered it all.
 Jason had been hiding two blue, full, water pistols behind his back and was now shooting them at Emily‚Äôs face.
 She was holding up her hands and letting out some sort of squeal.

Most women would never again speak to a man who had rejected her touch.
 But most women would have known exactly what they were doing.
 Marie had simply been yielding to the pleasure of his kisses and touches with no intention of giving up her virginity.
 He'd never known a woman so passionate.
 When they walked out into the garden, Marie headed for the fog without a backward glance.
 Rick grabbed her hand.
 "Marie, wait."
 He pulled her close, gazing down at her.

 There is nothing more glamorous about this drug than heroin.

 And the last step, when addicts can no longer afford Oxy, is to get on heroin.
 Lives are ruined or lost completely to this drug, which, unlike the drugs of the past, is found in the medicine cabinets of parents, grandparents and patients with severe pain all over this world.

"There's nothing to see here, kids.
 I want you to all disperse and go to your home rooms."
 The short, mostly bald man who'd ordered us all to leave was just visible through a gap in the crowd.
 He walked like an administrator, but I hadn't ever seen him before.
 "Who's that?"
 Brandon started just a little, like he'd been thinking of something else.
 "Mr. Rindell, the assistant principal."
 Now that my complete attention wasn't on the various destroyed bits of school property, I noticed how much whispering was going on.
 Most of it was too quiet to catch more than bits and pieces, but I heard more than one 'completely jacked up', and a few people wondering what could have caused that kind of destruction.
 Mr. Rindell apparently heard much of the same snippets of conversation.

The last time she'd seen Davis, he'd kissed her so hard that her teeth had cut her lips.
 And he certainly hadn't apologized.
 She touched the ring that Davis had put on her left hand, twisting it.

 CHAPTER SEVEN
 In spite of her lack of sleep, Marie awoke early the next morning.
 She couldn't wait to go to the shore.
 After her walk through the garden, Rick wanted to go back to bed for a while, but she begged him to leave right away.
 Excitedly she put on her bathing suit, glad that there was no full-length mirror in her room.
 Rick had assured her that her bathing suit was very modest for 2011, but she still felt apprehensive as she stepped into the hall.

Seth grinned at my clumsiness and waited for me to walk up to him.
 I wacked his head with the back of my hand, making his hair stick up.
 He smoothed it down and we walked across the flat ground.
 The ground had spots of grass sticking out of sand and rock.
 Luckily, there was no wind down here to toss up the sand and dirt.
 I think I passed the spot where the Kojas had stood in my dream.
 I threw the thoughts out of my head and tried to think of something else.
 Like, where this flat plain of flatness ended.
 ‚ÄúWhere are we going, anyway?‚Äù I asked and stared at the sky.
 It was going to get dark soon.

Brandon seemed to understand that my silence meant I wasn't convinced.
 "You wouldn't believe how relieved I was when you stepped forward and stopped her before things got out of hand."
 My natural pessimism reasserted itself, undaunted by the fact that I could just see Brandon's exquisitely-muscled arm out of the corner of my eye.
 "If you knew Cassie was in the wrong, why didn't you stop her?
 She's your friend; you should have been able to defuse the situation before it got that far."
 Brandon took a deep breath.
 His voice was quiet now, the perfect example of someone admitting something they weren't proud of.
 "Things are complicated with Cassie.
 Our families go really far back, it's almost like she's my sister sometimes.
 She doesn't like to listen to me, and when she gets mad, things get very unpleasant."

She'd been a little flighty before, but now it wasn't uncommon for her to be gone for twenty-four hours at a stretch.
 In some ways it was hard not having her around, but in other ways it was a relief.
 Sometimes she reminded me too much of Dad and Cindi.
 A surge of guilt splashed around inside me at the thought, but it was a realization I'd made weeks ago.
 By now some of the sharper edges to the emotion had worn away.
 I shrugged, dropping my book and binder on the floor next to my bed.
 Dwelling on the guilt would just make me think about why I felt guilty in the first place.
 I'd find myself on the floor with no memory of how I'd gotten there.
 By the time I'd brushed my teeth and finished the rest of my nightly ritual, my mind was wholly in the present, and I was starting to get a little depressed.
 I'd never particularly fit in back home, but there'd been enough other people in various fringe groups that I'd always felt like I had somewhere to go if I ever wanted more friends.

 ‚ÄúYou will know.‚Äù She motioned for us to move up to the doors.
 I walked slowly and leaned forward to see the symbol.
 Amazingly, I walked right up to the one with an arrow on it.
 I looked to the left and saw a door with a sword on it.
 I sighed and pushed open my door.
 The small room also had glass ceilings but they were dimmer.
 The room was dark and cold, with dust in the air.
 ‚ÄúI was wondering when you would get here,‚Äù a familiar voice said.
 I jumped and looked into one of the corners.

Clumsiness, lack of skill, never quite fitting in.
 What took me by surprise was the betrayal I felt.
 All the years I‚Äôd lived in the village, I‚Äôd never counted on anyone the way I had done with this group, Chevelle especially.
 The feeling in my chest was so thick and heavy it burned.
 Struggling with my reactions kept me distracted from the ride.
 It was steep now, rocky, a haze hanging in the few spiky trees.
 When we stopped for the evening, the men quietly set up a perimeter.
 Except for Chevelle.
 He was watching me as I glared back at him.
 Why had I expected more from him?

Normally that wouldn't have caused me to even pause in my normal routine, but it suddenly felt as if the stall was too small.
 "I told you to stay away from him, you stupid whore."
 I didn't recognize the voice for all that I felt like I should.
 It was a snarling alto that even distorted by anger had traces of smooth velvet, the kind of voice guys occasionally fantasized about, when they weren't thinking about other, less subtle, feminine features.
 Something hit the stall next to me, hard enough to leave dents.
 I was scared, I should have been terrified, but I was too busy trying to breathe.
 It was like the air had become thick, and although the fine strands of hair on the back of my neck hadn't moved, it felt like they should be standing on end.
 I heard indistinct sobbing, and then the voice returned and made me shiver.
 The sensation started somewhere on my back, and traveled forward like it was clawing to get out of my face.
 "I know you're sorry, just like you were sorry before.

 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll wait until morning.

 She walked away, cast a levitation spell upon herself, and then settled in for sleep hovering an inch above the grass.
 ‚ÄúOdd girl,‚Äù Qurrah whispered.
 Harruq forced a laugh.
 To Qurrah‚Äôs eyes, he looked exhausted, and the shrinking of his muscles was glaring.

He walked over to it.
 It looked like it could have been the twin for the beast that had been devoured by the blue flame on top of Raven Keep.
 He stepped up close looking up at the beast; he was massive!
 The beast‚Äôs mouth was open, not as if he was going to roar, but simply in relaxed pose.
 He looked like he had been caught stalking forward on the hunt.
 Rodregas stepped up and just stared at him.
 He was beautiful.
 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch,‚Äù barked Doi‚Äôvan.
 Rodregas nodded, he knew not to touch, but then realized that his hand was raised and had been reaching out to stroke the lion‚Äôs mane.
 He knew that this was the greater sigil that he wanted to gain.

 ‚ÄúRemain faithful to me, and to Karak, and I shall see it come to pass.‚Äù
 Qurrah nodded but said nothing.
 Instead, he turned and joined his brother.

I strode to their car, jammed my head through rolled-down shotgun side window and stared at Kris.
 ‚ÄúYou babysitting these guys?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt work out,‚Äù she said.
 Butch grabbed the door handle, but Jimmy told him to be cool, and he motioned me around to his side of the car.
 After I staggered there, I lashed him with a string of curses for two-timing my cousin and stealing my girl.
 And I gave notice that if Kris didn‚Äôt get out and come with me, I was going to pluck them both out of the car and so on.
 Jimmy sat rubbing his temples.
 Then he rolled up the window, started the car, and droved away.
 I slept on Jill‚Äôs couch.
 In the morning I walked to a donut shop.
 It had a service window opening onto the sidewalk.

He looked so happy, so at peace with the world, that for the brief moment between when I saw him and when I recognized him, I thought I'd seen an angel.
 I'd always thought that intense look of concentration was the sign of a true artist.
 Maybe it still was.
 Maybe whatever he was drawing was absolute crap.
 Maybe the masters like Michelangelo and da Vinci had completed their greatest works with expressions very similar to what everyone else in the class was sporting.
 Still, I couldn't help envy such contentment.
 I dropped off my bundle of papers at Mrs. North's class, and started back towards my locker.
 I couldn't help trying to catch another glimpse of the art class as I walked past.
 I'd been hoping to see Alec again, but hadn't expected him to look up as I craned my neck to see inside.
 I stumbled a little in surprise.

Rodregas decided that Brit and Geor were like pale shadows as they quickly followed suit.
 When he turned to the last two he saw that they were very interested in what he was saying.
 ‚ÄúWhere do you go, Sir Paladin?‚Äù He showed no sense of humor at Rodregas‚Äô little joke about being a Paladin; Rodregas hoped Doi‚Äôvan had not taken him literally.
 ‚ÄúAs far as I can, is my main plan at the moment.
 Clearly the Guild of the Celestial Path is going to be looking for me.
 Let‚Äôs just say I don‚Äôt wish to be found anywhere right now.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd if they find you‚Ä¶ and they will in time, will you then become a Vengeance Daemon?‚Äù asked the Hellborn.
 Rodregas simply flourished his short swords and smiled and stated, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say that it should be interesting.‚Äù The Hellborn nodded very thoughtfully at Rodregas reply.
 The half AElf had followed the conversation between them with obvious interest, and quickly followed Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs‚Äô lead in swearing the oath to the All-Father.
 But with the two of them the oath seemed different, more easily said and with no need for threats.
 Rodregas was not sure why, but he decided it was something to think about when he had more time.

Historically, democracy broke the monopoly of the aristocracy over governance of the people, giving freedom and rights to the individual politically.
 The market system ‚Äì basing itself on property rights and self-determined initiatives of the individual producer and consumer ‚Äì is an economic expression of the same principle.
 Both democracy and market-oriented economies decentralize authority and decision making, providing the essential legal and regulatory framework and empowering the individual to choose and act with minimum direction or interference from above.
 Both depend for their success on the quality of those choices, which means on the quality of education and information possessed by the mass of people, and on the freedom and dynamism of the population.
 In contrast, authoritarian systems and command economies centralize decision making, restrict the flow of information to the public, foster vast unresponsive bureaucracies, limit individual freedom and initiative within narrow bounds, and encourage obedience and conformity rather than innovation.
 The spread of education, which fosters independent thinking, and dissemination of information through the media were important factors in undermining public acceptance of communism in Eastern Europe.
 In a real sense, it was Gorbachev‚Äôs policy of glasnost that brought down the Iron Curtain.
 It opened up an insular society and exposed it to an avalanche of new information, new ideas and new possibilities, which released a fervent aspiration in the people for a better life.
 Over the last few years, democratization has been especially dynamic in Africa, where it has been dubbed Africa‚Äôs Second Liberation.
 During the first three decades of post-colonial independence, almost all of the continent‚Äôs 54 states had come under either single-party or military rule.

This is still the hour in which anything can happen, provided we are determined to make it happen.
 It is not a question of possibility or prediction, but of decision and determination to walk the talk.
 Peace & Security
 Nuclear Disarmament: The threat of a nuclear holocaust remains very real so long as stockpiles of these weapons remain in existence ‚Äì their very existence constitutes a threat ‚Äì and so long as nations or groups insist on the prerogative of manufacturing, possessing and using them.
 While the number of nuclear missiles and bombs has been dramatically reduced, both the USA and Russia retain thousands of such weapons.
 The number of nuclear weapons states has increased and the threat of first use has been extended to Israel, the Indian subcontinent and the Korean peninsula.
 South Africa and some former Soviet republics have voluntarily relinquished their claims as nuclear weapons states.
 Few realize that the catastrophic damage caused by the atomic bombing of Japan at the end of World War II dwindles into insignificance when compared with the destructive power and radioactive fall-out that would result from the explosion of even the smallest nuclear device today.
 Until the last nuclear weapon has been destroyed, the threat of accidental or intentional usage remains very real and very serious.
 The nuclear weapon states must come forward to fulfil the commitments made in the non-proliferation treaties by taking active and immediate steps leading to total nuclear disarmament by all powers within the shortest possible time.

I answered Britney's whispered questions without ever registering them and never once worried about whether or not I'd made sense.
 I parried Mrs. Campbell's concerned inquiries in much the same manner, probably not convincing her that I was okay, but at least persuading her to leave me alone, and then sleep-walked into the cafeteria.
 I hated the fact that I wanted Brandon to come sit down with me.
 If he did a convincing enough job pretending to like me and I tried really hard, maybe I'd believe it'd all just been my imagination.
 It'd be one less piece of my world crumbling out from under me.
 Britney slammed her tray down, but my listless gaze didn't move from the vacant corner where Brandon usually sat.
 A few minutes later a group of girls came to join us.
 I recognized them, but didn't bother putting names to the faces.
 It was like I got hit with another panic attack.
 Somehow I lost an hour, but nobody was running around calling for an ambulance so I must have at least responded to direct questions.

 He had a business degree, was something of a math whiz, I think, and he worked in the back room of this paint store in a strip shopping center, most days.
 Sometimes my friends and I would walk up there and visit him.
 He looked sad, sitting at this shitty little desk, with a calculator and a pencil in his hand, and bad lighting.
 It was like the stage set for some damn O‚ÄôNeill play, you know, all whites and grays and shadows.
 But, he greeted us like we were the best thing he‚Äôd seen all day.
 And his boss, Mr. Waddell, was a nice guy, a heavy set, crew-cut, ex-Marine, with a face like a catcher‚Äôs mitt, and he‚Äôd always give us this big, fake hello and hand us all bubble gum.

‚ÄúNo sleep tonight,‚Äù he said, turning back to the building that had been his shelter.
 Fire swarmed around his fingers.
 Like streams of water, it flowed from his hands, splashing across the roof and setting it ablaze.
 Finished, he ran for an alley to hide as the fire gained the attention of the many patrols.
 He heard footsteps and shouts further down the road so he ducked left, running in between homes as all around the shouts grew louder.
 The houses ended, and like a fleeing thief he burst out into the streets only to slam into a drunken man holding a small bottle.
 The two rolled, a tangle of legs and arms.
 The small bottle shattered.

Start with the spirit.
 So, I thought, what could best set my spirit on the right path?
 I believe it was God who sent the message: "Look here, you're a writer.
 But for months you haven't been writing, which has grieved your spirit into a coma.
 Sure, teaching nine classes and raising kids is hard, but it‚Äôs not going to kill you.
 What will kill you is not writing.‚Äù The next morning, I got up at 5 a.m. instead of 5:30, which allowed me to write for a half hour.
 Not much, but enough to give me hope, which is the antidote to despair.
 The stuff I wrote during those half-hour sessions became crucial parts of my novel The Loud Adios.
 About a month after the semester ended, I sent the manuscript to a national contest.
 I won.

Or maybe the cause was the sight of a dancer on the stage beside the bar.
 She was naked except panties sagged around her knees.
 I thought, the babe with auburn hair could be here in her place, if instead of having folks who were churchgoing gringos she had gotten born where I imagined this stoned, lost and weepy dancer had, as the fifteenth child of someone who lived in a hut beside a brown river.
 When a fellow vacated his bar stool, I excused myself from the table and moved there.
 I ordered another shot of tequila, and stared at the mirror behind the liquor shelf, wondering if I looked any different than before I surrendered to Jesus.
 I couldn‚Äôt spot a single feature that appeared more saintly or pure.
 I felt no more likely to hand over my jacket to whomever asked, let alone to throw in my shirt.
 The only change I recognized, I felt more confounded than ever.
 Someone had told me, when you drink tequila, make sure you count the shots.
 So I kept count.

 She bounced back over to Jason's side and waited for me to continue but there was nothing else to say.
 I had told her everything I needed to tell her.
 Did she somehow know that I wasn't telling her the whole story?
 I looked at Seth out of the corner of my eye and saw him doing the same.

 She twisted her head about to kiss his throat.

It was  not just that they seemed to combine multiple unconnected animals, but the size and shapes were simply wrong.
 Rodregas looked up from his examination of a strange bull daemon and looked for Doi‚Äôvan.
 He must have been more familiar with the powers of the various creatures.
 Doi‚Äôvan had walked past many of the figures until he stood at one toward the back.
 The shape was a powerfully built dragon with wings partially spread as if getting ready to fly.
 But unlike a real dragon this one had three heads at the end of long serpentine necks; one was that of a wolf, one was of an eagle and one was of a lion.
 ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù he asked Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúA Bunei.

It was a sudden and violent and primal process.
 The lion started to stand up and then simply fell apart into blazing blue energy.
 That energy surged out of the circle and swirled around inside the larger outer circle.
 Every hair on Rodregas‚Äô body stood at attention.
 Then the blue flaming energy was sucked into the pale green circle.
 There the prisoner, now empty of his own essence, stood still.
 As the blue fire was sucked into his body, the corporal body suddenly seemed more solid than before.
 Once more Ravenhurr yelled out in his melodious voice the trigger words for the next part of the ritual, ‚ÄúMana faria podia ricoria.‚Äù It was now or never for Rodregas to strike.

 There was no time to see if his club hit Junnit or if the half AElfin maiden ran.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre gonna fight me, fight me!‚Äù he yelled.
 He ignored several strikes, accepting the cuts so he could close the distance between him and his opponent.
 The sound of steel was quick and brutal, but after the humiliation against Dieredon, Harruq felt as if his opponent moved through sand.
 At the end of three seconds, both of his blades had found flesh.
 The guard fell at his feet, bleeding from a severed arm and a gutted belly.
 Soaked in blood, Harruq turned to the remaining guards and bellowed like the mad beast he was.
 The remaining two facing him were trained well.
 They held firm when Harruq charged, and stayed close together.
 Because of this, they managed to survive the initial onslaught.

But I don‚Äôt throw parties, so what good is a big house to me?

 To me, the key to living well is living in a way that gives an opportunity for appreciating nature and friends and taking time for prayer and writing and helping people.
 And unless you inherit a pile of money, the way to live like that is to not want a lot of stuff.
 Most stuff is just clutter.
 But our culture feeds the desire to own or consume until what we think we need makes us greedy.

All of the treaty non-signatories can be persuaded to sign in exchange for annihilation of these weapons by those that now possess them.
 Under these circumstances, refusal to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty could be considered sufficient grounds for expulsion from UN membership.
 Without a universal ban, the efforts of the nuclear powers to stop proliferation lack moral authority.
 Arguments are often advanced that nuclear weapons cannot be ‚Äòdis-invented‚Äô, and that the danger of a rogue state or terrorist group acquiring and threatening use of these weapons necessitates that the present nuclear powers retain them for such a contingency.
 With the massive conventional firepower already available, nuclear weapons are not needed for defence, even against a rogue state with nuclear capability, and they do not represent a credible defence against terrorism under any circumstances.
 How could nuclear weapons conceivably be used to retaliate against terrorism?
 Alternative solutions can be found to address these threats far more effectively.
 Similar arguments were made in the past against complete eradication of chemical weapons.
 The new treaty for the abolition of chemical weapons provides a useful model.
 Chemical weapons technology is far easier to acquire and violations of the treaty are far more difficult to verify.

 Seething, he limped back to Qurrah and their home.
 Neither said a word as he discarded his armor, tossed his swords into a corner, and crashed onto their bed of straw.
 For a long moment, only the sound of Harruq‚Äôs heavy breathing filled the room.
 ‚ÄúI assume things didn‚Äôt go well?‚Äù Qurrah finally asked.

 I debated dodging the question, but it was normal to talk about boys.

 A knowing look flashed across Britney's face.
 "Oh, their royal highnesses Alec and Jasmin.
 They're pretty distracting all right, but don't waste your time.
 They'll never waste a thought on you or me, or pretty much anyone."
 The way she said their names implied they were a couple.
 Even if they weren't, she was probably right about not getting my hopes up.
 Especially considering the way Alec had looked at me there at the end.

‚ÄúWe kill them all.‚Äù I glanced around the clearing as the others watched me.

 Anvil smiled.
 A movement at the tree line caught everyone‚Äôs attention, and I turned to find Chevelle‚Äôs onetime guest, Asher.
 He stood in the shadows, staff in hand, as if allowing us to see.
 The air was still as he inclined his head toward Chevelle and then turned, a long, dark braid whipping behind him as he disappeared into the brush.
 This seemed to mean something to the group, something like relief.
 I stared after him, but Anvil stepped forward, thumping his balled fist against his chest in a gesture I didn‚Äôt understand.

He paused.
 "I'm sorry.

 When he didn't get a response, he turned toward the stairs with a sigh.
 He'd known exactly what he was doing when he'd kissed her, and he'd known it was unfair.
 He couldn't blame her for being angry.

"Well, I'm glad things turned out the way they did.
 Otherwise we'd both be dead."
 Alec flinched slightly, and then looked at the grotto.
 "I suppose I'd better clean this up or Donovan is going to be very unhappy with me."
 "Who's Don...." I felt my mouth drop as I finally recognized my surroundings.
 "I've been here before.
 In my dream.
 Then I drew it, which I didn't understand because I only ever draw real places, and this was imaginary.
 Only it wasn't, but there wasn't any way for me to know..." I turned around, expecting to have to field a barrage of questions, but Alec was calmly watching me.

 The words of his brother echoed in his head.
 ‚ÄúAurry?‚Äù he asked.

As soon as he was able to move again, he went back and I haven't seen him since."
 "But how?"
 The question just kind of popped out before I could think.
 It could've been taken as the worst kind of insensitivity; Mallory just gave my hand another squeeze.
 "He hasn't always been crippled.
 In fact he used to be a delightful dancer.
 His injuries were sustained at the hands of the individuals who killed Alec's father, the same ones who wanted to kill me, and who tortured Donovan for days before finally accepting that I'd died from the wounds that left me like this."
 Mallory shrugged, slowly and painfully in response to my questioning look.
 "My scars aren't readily visible, but they're there.

 She turned and threw her arms around him.
 She was in a party scene, one of six people that formed a group with the star.
 She wasn't supposed to do anything but smile and sip her drink, but when the star gave her a smoldering glance during rehearsal, the director decided he wanted to film it.
 The result was a split-second close-up of her face, and the star kissed her hand.
 Marie felt as if she were going to burst from excitement.

There was a tease to her voice and expression that said she knew what he was thinking and that she did not mind.
 Rodregas was an experienced man but he was not sure if he had ever seen a woman as beautiful as her, much less thought that he ever had a chance with such a woman.
 He had to smile, amused by his own reaction, as he felt his heartbeat speed up and a rush of heat.
 He had not felt such hormonal surges in a long time.
 He made a decision in his head.
 He had carefully been a gentleman now for several weeks and had not tried anything with the beautiful half AElf, but her teasing expression left him an opening.
 He decided to take advantage of it.
 He spoke very slowly and carefully, letting her know that he knew what he was saying.
 ‚ÄúActually, I was looking at you, you are amazingly beautiful.
 Your incredible eyes and hair, you are breathtaking.‚Äù Rodregas looked at her, his eyes going slowly over her entire body as he spoke.

The increasing destructiveness of violent conflict to society in general has resulted in a shift in military strategy from actual fighting to preventive diplomacy.
 The Helsinki Process, the Stockholm Document, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Warsaw Treaty‚Äôs adoption of the doctrine of ‚Äònon-offensive defence‚Äô, and most recently the UN Secretary General‚Äôs Agenda for Peace ‚Äì all give highest priority to war prevention.
 While welcome, these incremental measures do not fully recognize either the extent of the danger of the continued application of violence to achieve political ends or the extent of the opportunity which the end of the Cold War has brought for radically altering the way in which humanity settles domestic and international disputes.
 There was a time when war could be justified as a necessary expedient.
 Now the potential human and economic costs of even limited terrorist war ‚Äì especially if it involves the use of nuclear or biological weapons, but even otherwise ‚Äì are so great that the risks are no longer tolerable.
 Because the potential risks far outweigh the possible advantages of continued reliance on this means of achieving national and international security, war has become obsolete as an instrument of policy.
 At the same time, there is no longer an insurmountable political conflict within the UN system to prevent all member countries from agreeing to a total ban on the use of violence against each other.
 It is time for the UN to declare war itself a crime against humanity and to ban from membership any nation that engages in aggression against another.
 Even if this intention cannot immediately be made effective, the adoption of this Peace Imperative would mark a milestone in human affairs.
 There is no rational or practical obstacle to the immediate adoption of this measure.

 I gave Rachel a hug as soon as she was within arm's reach.
 "I'm so sorry.

 She waved the explanation away.
 "Brandon's fooled people smarter than both of us put together.

About 95 per cent of the growth in the world labour force over the next 35 years will take place in developing countries.
 An additional 260 million people will enter the workforce during the 1990s.
 Employment in the East Asian economies is projected to grow by 37 per cent between 1990 and 2000, while the labour force will increase by only 17 per cent, leading to an increasing shortage of labour in the region.
 In contrast, employment growth is projected to lag behind labour force growth in South Asia, Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa.
 Although job growth has once again started in many OECD countries, economic growth alone will not be sufficient to bring down unemployment rates significantly, especially among youth and the long-term unemployed.
 Changes in values, attitudes, structures and policies will be necessary.
 Unless concerted action steps are taken, global unemployment will increase by 130 million during the 1990s.
 Our thesis is that there is a great deal that can be done to prevent this outcome and even reverse the trend, leading to sharply reduced levels of unemployment and progressive eradication of poverty over the next decade.
 How can we make such an optimistic prognosis in the face of the rising number of unemployed and rising concern of governments everywhere?
 Before presenting our case, it is necessary to challenge several basic concepts about job creation and unemployment.

My mom and aunt were dressed for breakfast by the time we arrived, to their surprise and dismay.
 They loaned us their room until evening.
 Room service delivered bourbon and ginger ale.
 Around noon, we adjourned to the pool, on the lookout for showgirls.
 At least that was my motive.
 The pool featured a high dive like the one at Carmen Ranch Club where Eric worked part-time as an apprentice lifeguard and trampoline instructor.
 He climbed, sprang, jackknifed and got a few cheers from spectators, including several showgirls.
 Though I had never attempted a high dive before, after some bourbon, the feat looked simple.
 Inches from the end of the board was a depression full of water, on which my foot slipped.
 I tried to stop, but too late.

 He's always been one to see truly."
 "You are, I mean, you were close?"
 Her smile turned sad.
 "Actually, neither.
 We weren't close when there was an opportunity for closeness, and now that I'd like very few things more than to be close to him, there's no real opportunity for us to become so."
 She patted my hand as she shrugged.

And I was scared.
 I didn‚Äôt know what had happened, what was wrong with me, but I was certain whatever it was, Chevelle would take me straight back to the village.
 We stayed there for some time, a fact for which I was grateful.
 Even though whatever had happened seemed to have passed, neither man seemed in a hurry to go.
 Chevelle glanced at me occasionally but kept himself busy around the fire.
 Steed still played with his feather, eventually entertaining me with it.
 It spun toward me and turned down, tickling my arm and then my nose.
 I giggled despite my wariness, and reached up to rub my nose where the plume had brushed it.
 I noticed the map on my palms.

He didn‚Äôt reply to me because he had spotted Emily.
 She was slowly backing up with her palms out.
 Fire danced from her fingertips and twisted towards the troll and frost beast.
 The beast breathed and ice sprayed from its mouth.
 Emily moved her hand over and the ice evaporated into mist.
 She was holding up fine but I didn‚Äôt know how much longer.
 I strung my bow and released an arrow.
 It pierced the frost beast‚Äôs pelt and it fell to the ground.
 Emily turned to me with huge, confused eyes.
 She mouthed the words, thank you.

Let's get a move on and leave this small, damp cave.‚Äù I shrugged and followed her out.
 The sky was lit but still had a gloomy feeling mixed in with the warmth.
 I felt a sense of dread as we entered the never-ending forest again.
 A few rays fought their way through the thick canopy of trees, making it possible to see what was around you.
 Seth led the way as we followed a faint path through the unknown.
 I was bringing up the rear of the line, Emily in front of me.
 I watched her cloak swish around her ankles, the rhythm surprisingly soothing to me.
 The silence was unnatural, and I felt like there should be some kind of sound.
 I shouldn't have thought that.
 Out of nowhere I heard a single rattle.

 Her expression made it clear she considered herself forgiven.
 She turned, facing the direction Chevelle had gone, and left me to my discoveries.
 I expected fury from my father.
 He never failed to disappoint me.
 He saw the child, as he called her, as an opportunity.

 --@ The hand-drawn symbol on the bottom of the page was so familiar it almost felt like a part of me now.
 He'd saved our house, got Mom a job, and then given me the best birthday present I could've asked for.
 I felt my insides clench and knot, but this time it was happiness that brought tears to my eyes.
 My wavering vision was just up to making out the outline of Rachel's present where I'd left it on the table.
 Feeling incredibly ungrateful and thoughtless, I limped over to the table and tore open the delicate wrapping paper.
 It was a copy of the latest Les Mis√©rables movie, complete with the score from the most recent Broadway production, and a signed picture of the entire cast.
 Mom still wasn't home by the time it got dark, but I went to bed truly happy for the first time in ages.
 Rachel was the best friend a girl could wish for, and Brandon had come through in spades.
 Chapter 18 I felt my stomach do handsprings as I walked inside the opera house.

In the aftermath of the Gulf crisis, labour-supplying countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, the Sudan and Syria have suffered the most.
 Returnees swelled Jordan‚Äôs population by 8.4 per cent and caused unemployment levels to rise above 20 per cent.
 Unemployment levels among Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank are among the highest in the world.
 A dramatic exception to this gloomy trend comes from the countries of Asia and the Pacific, which have made great strides in job generation during the 1980s and are poised to continue expanding rapidly.
 The Newly Industrializing Economies (NIEs) ‚Äì Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan-China ‚Äì are all facing severe labour shortages, with Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia also moving in that direction.
 But other Asian countries continue to face major challenges in creating sufficient jobs for all.
 China has created a phenomenal 100 million new jobs since 1985 and continues to grow rapidly, but the country still has a pool of 130 million surplus rural workers.
 Joblessness in Chinese cities is projected to reach 5 million by the end of 1994.
 India needs to create at least 100 million new jobs in the next ten years in order to raise all its poor above the poverty line.

When I blushed, he smiled a wicked smile.
 My mouth went dry.
 He was tall and broad with dark hair and eyes.
 Like Chevelle.
 Handsome too, I supposed, though I could tell even from these few gestures he was a bit cocky.
 He reminded me of Evelyn, always so proud of herself for finding me out.
 The stranger watched me as I ate.
 When I devoured the first piece, he laughed and threw me another.
 I hoped I looked appropriately abashed.
 As I finished the second serving, he stepped closer to sit on the misshapen rock that rose through the earth beside me.

In response to the torch the room seemed to respond with a vague light of its own, which came from all directions.
 The chamber was large with a tall vaulted ceiling like some temple, but no rows of seats or prayer mats did this temple hold.
 Instead it was filled with beasts; lions and wolves and the great mythical animals of the Celestial Realm.
 Most of these he recognized as the great totems of the Celestial Realm, each representing great power.
 The great beasts were full-size and, but for their lack of movement, Rodregas would have thought that they must have traveled to the Celestial Realm itself.
 ‚ÄúOh, my Gods, they look real.
 I thought they would be made of stone like the frog,‚Äù said Imeralda.
 Rodregas nodded.
 The beasts looked to be made of flesh and bone, except they all stood perfectly still on short stone pedestals.
 Strangely, the room did not smell of damp stone like the rest of the cathedral, but the air smelled of the outdoors in spring.

 he asked when they got home.
 "Yes--no.

The system of warehouse receipts enables American grain traders to purchase unseen crops with full confidence in their quality.
 The absence of this simple system retards trade on the recently established commodity markets in Russia and other CIS countries.
 A complete listing of essential institutions, small and large, should be compiled, based on the experience of other nations, and plans drawn up for introducing them.
 Thus far, the development of social organizations, like the development of technologies, has been partial, piecemeal and sectoral, leaving large gaps between parallel and interrelated activities and institutions.
 This is especially evident at the international level where the organization of the collective social life of humanity is rudimentary and fragmentary, though far more complete than it was a few decades ago.
 In spite of the phenomenal growth in global communications, transportation, commerce, finance and tourism, it is still more difficult to carry out most activities internationally than it is domestically, because the international activities are not as well organized.
 For instance, transfer of technology still involves a process that is largely trial and error.
 Firms in developing countries seeking to acquire the best available technology for importation or acquisition have to search at considerable expenditure of time and money to discover what is available within their own country as well as overseas.
 The process of identifying and commercially transferring technology can be vastly simplified and accelerated by the establishment of international technology transfer corporations, sponsored by UN agencies such as UNESCO and UNIDO, specializing in all major fields of technology.
 These corporations should be operated on a commercial, for-profit basis, though governments of developing countries could become shareholders in order to promote their formation.

I meant to love her baby like my own.

 As she walked out with him, she waved goodbye to me.
 Earlier that day, I had noticed a Kitchen Help Wanted sign in a coffee shop.
 Since I hoped to become an instant father, in order to show the waitress my responsible side, I inquired about the job.

The Danger of Watching Joan of Arcadia
 In Oregon, I‚Äôm speeding alongside one of the many wide and glistening rivers and gazing across at concentric rows of emerald hills at intervals topped with lacy clouds when I catch myself admiring them to such a degree I could call it worship.
 Then something reminds me to turn from worshiping the creation to worshiping its creator.
 To adore a feeling or state of mind, such as the revelation of beauty in nature or the way a lover makes me feel, may involve nothing but selfishness.
 But to adore the creator of that feeling, God for creating nature, a lover for giving me a piece of her heart, or parents for providing warmth and safety, that is appreciation, gratitude, untainted by the selfishness that all sin is made of.
 Maybe if I practice this exercise, try to catch myself in each act of admiration, and turn my worship to the creator, I will gradually learn to adore God the father, and God the spirit.
 But for now, my thoughts drift back to Eric.
 I have tried, on this trip, to relive our whole two years of brotherhood.
 And now I reconsider the fact that he didn‚Äôt die the moment his head rammed the boulder.
 He lived for a day, during which we got confronted with the possibility that drove my story ‚ÄúCars‚Äù, that he might live another sixty years without the use of his marvelous brain.

In those first years back, the times I lived for were coaching Cody and the team during practices and ball games at Kuhlken Field, home of La Mesa National Little League.

The bark of the branch was smoother and offered less of a grip.
 Finally he got to the top, which was broad and actually rather cup-like against the main trunk.
 Though he worried about Imeralda, he let himself rest for a moment to recover.
 After a few minutes Rodregas got up and looked around for Imeralda.
 He saw that she was actually far out on another impossibly think branch.
 By the Infernals he swore to himself.
 She was a Forest Nymph.
 He thought he should just leave her there.
 She could do this far easier than he.
 Rodregas had an urge to leap from his branch to the other like a cat.

Rodregas knew that he did not have the skills for pretending he was a powerful Immortalist sorcerer, so he said, ‚ÄúHow many people have you killed during the past year Korin?
 And how many others have you raped or tortured?‚Äù he asked, trying to keep a calm voice.
 Now Korin looked very surprised and he started looking around.
 Rodregas saw that Korin noticed the study door, though he was working hard to not show it.
 ‚ÄúHow many?‚Äù Rodregas repeated his question.
 ‚ÄúI am not sure,‚Äù Korin said.
 ‚ÄúFor us to truly become divine we must of course develop our skills.‚Äù As Korin answered the question he took a step back.
 Rodregas quickly stepped forward and pushed him hard against the wall.
 Korin hit with a hard smack and slid to the ground, hurt, but not badly.
 Rodregas slammed the door closed and relocked it.

Let us hearken back, briefly, to those days when music was being made because it was important, because genius finds its own level, because people needed godhead, if that‚Äôs not overstating it.
 Before the drugs, the recriminations, the lawsuits, the doubting of the very fiber of what the 60s meant to Memphis, to these sweet souls herein, and to the world at large.
 Let us reimagine it, if we can, in all its efflorescence.
 In all its pied beauty.
 Let‚Äôs hear again, ‚ÄúTurntable Poison‚Äù as if for the first time and marvel at the voice that said, ‚ÄúWe are all naked.‚Äù  That said, ‚ÄúLove me for my limo but love me all the way.‚Äù  And, that said, presciently, ‚ÄúDeath is only a way station, between West Memphis and the coast.‚Äù These interviews were done in three sessions in early 1973, in San Francisco, by Creole Myers, at Buddy Gardner‚Äôs home.
 Lorelei Enos was in and out.
 One of the startling revelations found in these tapes is that Lorelei was with Buddy until the end.
 Rumors had her abandoning him after they had left Memphis for Los Angeles.
 Stories circulated back home about her, unflattering stories all, about her working in the pornographic film industry, about her fixing Buddy that final fix, about her leaving him for a slick-talking Hollywood casting agent.
 What is made clear here is her devotion to him and his to her.

He slid his two swords out from their sheaths, stunned by the ease in which he moved them.
 It was if they went from being made of steel to air.
 He tossed them aside.
 Velixar pulled from within his cloak a chest the size of a small stone.
 He placed it on the grass where it shone gold in the light of the stars.
 As the two brothers watched, he whispered a few words of magic, enlarging the chest to normal size.
 ‚ÄúOver the centuries, I have gathered many items to aid those who would swear their lives to me,‚Äù Velixar said.
 The locks clicked open, the lid raised, and then he reached inside and pulled out two swords sheathed in gleaming obsidian.
 ‚ÄúThese swords were once wielded by Aerland Shen.
 He led the elves that aided Karak in the great war against Ashhur.

Her mom moved aside so I could walk in.
 I unlaced my sneakers and walked up the stairs, looking at the flower paintings hung along the wall that her mom had painted in her spare time.
 I pushed open Emily‚Äôs bedroom door to see her stuffing her clothes in the drawer and flopping onto the bed.
 She pulled out my bag and threw it to me so I could set up my sleeping bag on her rug.
 Her mom called us downstairs, hopefully for food.
 She held a box of pizza.
 ‚ÄúYou two can eat upstairs or down here.‚Äù She already knew our answer and handed us paper plates.
 I took three slices of pizza and ran upstairs.
 Emily and I sat on the floor, eating pizza and doodling nonsense in her notebook.

I nearly protested, but Alec was right, it would take an actual order to get Donovan to slow down, and two days was probably pushing it.
 Donovan somehow managed to respectfully circumvent any order he thought prevented him from taking adequate care of Alec's family.
 "Tell me about Christmas at the Paige house."
 I blinked a couple of times.
 The progress I'd made lately notwithstanding, I half expected the question to drive me into a panic attack.
 Apparently Alec's presence was proof against a second near attack today.
 "I don't know.
 We always used to do the standard kind of stuff.
 Presents, eggnog and the Christmas story.
 Usually Dad made us breakfast Christmas morning and then we'd drive out of the city later in the day and go sledding.

I bit my lip as I realized how spastic I was being.
 I'd spent the last sixteen-plus years suppressing my natural tendency to form crushes on one cute boy after another.
 I'd nearly perfected the art of exhibiting zero interest in the opposite sex.
 The whole point of my existence had been avoiding the kinds of things that'd result in everyone laughing at me.
 Why was I setting my sights on a boy who was so far out of my league?
 Even if there'd been a chance he might like me, I had absolutely no idea how to proceed.
 Given the option, I would've just hid behind the pillar until everyone left for class, but Britney had made her decision, and was paying for her food.
 Essentially out of time, I took a deep breath and followed her to a table.
 I couldn't help glancing towards Brandon's table one last time.
 I was hoping he was still smiling.

Chapter Five Trials
 I stood in the center of a council chamber I had never before seen.
 Vast libraries lined the walls, interspersed with decorated frames and ornate mirrors.
 A great vaulted ceiling rose overhead, embellished with intricate carvings, painted in every detail.
 Across the empty space before me was an elaborate table that seated six leaders of High Council.
 The guards who had brought me here were standing behind me, within arm‚Äôs reach on either side.
 Left of them were council members and, as I glanced right, Chevelle walked in to stand at attention, facing the council table.
 I could hear others enter behind us, presumably witnesses, and I wondered if Junnie was among them.
 ‚ÄúElfreda Georgiana Suzetta Glaforia stands before High Council‚Ä¶‚Äù The formal tone of the speaker severed my rambling thoughts, dragging me back to a frightening reality.
 What would they do to me?

The man in black had made no threatening move as the other two charged.
 They were almost upon him when he cast aside his hood to reveal his ever-changing face, his deep red eyes, and his horrible smile.
 His hands lunged forward, the floodgates opened, and all his power came rushing forth.
 A wall of black magic rolled like a tidal wave conjured from his fingertips.
 The elven brothers tumbled through and vanished.
 Felewen leapt back when she saw the attack coming.
 She rolled behind a house and tucked her head.
 The wave continued down the street, straight for Aurelia.
 ‚ÄúI do not fear you,‚Äù she hissed through clenched teeth.
 A wall of water swirled about her, flowing from the otherwise dry dirt street.

He'd give anything to keep her here with him, to marry her and make love to her and spend the rest of his life with her.
 Remembering that she‚Äôd said she liked being kissed on the neck, he moved to press his lips to her neck, kissing, nibbling, sucking.
 Marie gasped, threading her fingers into his hair.
 His hands slid down her back, pulling her hard against him, reminding her of how he'd pinned her against his car last night.
 Moaning at the pleasure of the contact, she wrapped her arms around him, wanting to get even closer to him.
 Rick covered her mouth with his again, his kiss so hot and thorough and demanding that it elicited more moans from her.
 He ended the embrace with a series of quick, hard kisses and then eased his hold on her, panting.
 Marie started to reach for him again, but then her eyes narrowed.
 Pushing against his chest so hard that he stumbled back, she whirled and stormed off into the fog.
 How dare he!

His skin was exquisitely tanned, lighter than Jasmin or Alec's, but exactly suited to his lighter hair tone.
 Friendly gray eyes perfectly spaced above some of the most natural looking white teeth I'd ever seen.
 My heart would have started slowing down if I'd been sure the display of teeth was a smile, but there was something about the expression that defied classification.
 Gritting my teeth slightly I let my gaze continue on down to assess the damage, only I couldn't.
 I could see the wet spots on the shirt.
 My mind was classifying it as a dark green polo with some kind of designer insignia but I couldn't¬†see anything other than how huge he was.
 I'd seen linemen on high-school football teams whose shoulders weren't as broad even with their pads on.
 The shirt was snug enough to see that the rest of him was built along the same lines.
 No wonder I'd bounced right off of him, a small car would've probably done about the same thing.
 My blush deepened slightly as I realized I was wondering what it would feel like to have those arms wrapped around me.

They are probably going to stop at Stallion‚Äôs Perch.‚Äù After much debate between the three of them Stallion‚Äôs Perch was their destination, a small keep that was known to breed Dire horses for the Immortal Guard.

 ‚ÄúThey are traveling with a patrol of Immortal guards.

 I was raised among AElfin, but these are my people.

I don't have anything this color, but I like it."
 It was called blue lotus and was the predominant color in an Egyptian motif.
 She and her mother had attended a fashion show two weeks ago, and she'd loved the Egyptian patterns on the mannequins who'd modeled them.
 But the mannequins were thin women, and although she was slender, she had too many curves to be fashionable.
 Binding her breasts helped a little, but it was hard to hide her hips and derriere.
 And she was rather petite, which didn‚Äôt help matters.
 Davis smiled at her in the ugly, shapeless dress.
 "It's very pretty.
 But how could it not be, with you wearing it."
 She blushed, pleased with his compliment.

Employment is a global problem that cannot be fully solved by individual countries in isolation.
 Policy measures at the national level influence trade and investment flows and employment rates in other countries.
 Economic growth and expansion of employment in one country enhance employment opportunities in other countries as well.
 Therefore, co ordination of policies is in the interests of the global community.
 A comprehensive and coordinated international effort is called for to improve the global climate for economic growth and job creation by evolving stable and supportive policies to regulate capital flows, foreign trade, debt, commodity pricing, immigration and labour movements, transfer of technology, investment, military spending and the arms trade.
 We set forth below a broad policy framework to stimulate global job growth with the aim of achieving full employment early in the twenty-first century.
 1.World Employment Programme: Raising incomes and creating jobs in the developing countries is the best way to promote global economic growth and employment generation in the coming decades.
 The World Summit on Social Development should call for a comprehensive World Employment Programme to stimulate more rapid growth in developing countries as an engine for global economic expansion.
 The International Labour Organization has operated a programme for the past two decades, but solution of the employment problem requires an integrated approach that transcends the scope of any single international agency.
 The programme should establish specific objectives and co ordinate efforts to stimulate international investment, increase labour market flexibility, promote productive skills, diffuse technology, eliminate protectionist trade policies that retard growth, increase trade between developing countries, and promote international cooperation on taxation systems to encourage more labour-oriented tax codes.

But I'll make you a good dinner."
 She enjoyed her lunch, the conversation as well as the food.
 Rick told her about how easy it was to get on an airplane any day and go anywhere in the world, about machines that made the house warm in winter and cool in summer, about telephones you could carry in your pocket.
 It was all so amazing.
 She'd always felt that she was living in very modern times‚Äîelectricity, automobiles, the new talkie.
 The wonders Rick described seemed like magic.
 They settled down on his sofa after lunch.
 "I'll start with the books.
 You do the articles," Rick said.
 "See if they say anything about the possibilities of time travel and how you'd go about it."

 "Do you want me to call in sick?"
 She drew back to look at him.
 "Would you do that?"
 "If you need me, sure."

 Jessica isn't any fonder of you now than she was then.
 I've been working with James every day since then, but he hasn't really come around yet, so he is still a bit of a problem.
 Luckily, with Alec and Isaac both firmly on your side, and Jasmin starting to develop a liking for you, there isn't a thing those two can really do about it.
 As long as Alec is very careful to stay between the two of them and you, you really don't have a reason to worry."
 "He let you get close to me."
 Dom's smile was incredibly winning.

 "You're different from the others then?

But as much as she enjoyed the "E.T."
 ride, it couldn't compare to the "Back to the Future" ride.
 That was really like flying--even more than in the airplane.
 It was more like having wings of her own, soaring high and low, below bridges and over mountains.
 "We really never left the ground?"
 she asked Rick as they waited to ride it a second time.
 "No.
 The car just jerks us around, and that combined with the effect of the picture makes you feel like you're flying."
 "Did you like it?"
 "Yeah--it was fun.

She took scissors from a drawer and reached for a lock on the back of her head.
 She snipped one off and handed it to Rick.
 "We should find a ribbon to tie it so that the strands won't come lose."

 This was all he'd have left of her.
 Swallowing, he nodded.
 "I don't have any, but I'll buy one.

Maybe I'll start praying the words of a poem by Olga Savitsky, a friend who adored God.
 She said so often, and she was honest above all, and she lived as much like Brother Lawrence as anybody I know, or know of, maybe excepting some of Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity.
 Here's Olga's poem: Father, heart-melting Father, I have tried to let go of so many things.
 Help me let go.
 If I can of my own do nothing, I can of my own self let go of nothing.
 I ask for the help of the Helper.
 I ask for the Master-yielder to show me how to yield.
 Jesus, Supreme of surrender Who obeyed unto death, You who proclaimed, "Not my will but Yours be done," Unless you say that through me, I will continue to march to the beat of my own heart.
 Think through me Speak through me Obey through me.
 Lord, Ordainer of obedience, I bow before You.

At the same time, they organized the importation of foreign technology on a massive scale.
 They utilized import tariffs, export incentives, tax relief and other mechanisms to guide development of their domestic economies.
 The reform programme involved the dismantling of most of the administrative mechanisms by which an economy can be monitored and controlled by government.
 In place of free market conditions, organized crime and corruption became rampant.
 In seeking to reject thoroughly the authoritarian form of government that suppressed the rights of the people, many of these countries allowed the power and authority of their central governments to de cline to the point where they could no longer enforce conditions needed for operation of either a command economy or a free market system.
 The power of government in the West may be veiled by the fact that its laws are usually obeyed without the need for exercise of force, but the threat of enforcement is as real for tax evaders in North America as it was for free marketers under the communist regime in USSR.
 Regardless of the system, strong government is a prerequisite for a strong economy.
 The experience of the past few years has clearly demonstrated that the state must play a very active role in order to bring about a smooth and rapid transition and this role cannot be limited purely to regulation of the market.
 Intervention will also be necessary in the form of central planning and industrial policy, at least¬†during the transition period.
 The radical restructuring of entire industries ‚Äì defence, agriculture, aluminium, steel ‚Äì is too complex and massive an undertaking to be made the responsibility of market forces and individual firms.

 He threw his hands up, covering his face, screaming.
 But he did not attack me.
 As I rose back to find my next target, I saw the wolves.
 They were also not being attacked, fighting with no opposition.
 And then I remembered what Chevelle had said.
 They would not kill the animals.
 As I laughed, the hawk screeched, and Chevelle and Steed glanced up at the sound.
 They were fighting, almost back to back, the bodies of councilmen strewn around them.
 I surveyed the land, searching for a stronger animal to jump to, something more harmful.

After knocking him off his feet, Felewen snapped her legs high above her, spinning her body off the ground.
 She landed on her stomach, her sword skewering the guard‚Äôs innards.
 She pulled herself to her feet with the hilt of her sword, twisted the blade, and then finished him.
 The remaining soldiers turned to flee, but there was one slight problem.
 An enormous ball of fire erupted at their feet, engulfing all three in flame.
 Two died from the horrible burns.
 A third slumped and whimpered in pain.
 Aurelia walked over to him and knelt on one knee.
 She placed a hand on his head and looked over his wounds while he glared up at her.
 ‚ÄúYour wounds are beyond saving,‚Äù she said softly.

A detailed study should be conducted under the auspices of the United Nations, OECD or the European Commission to quantify the potential gains or losses to the global economy of rapid or slow progress of the transition in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
 10.Scientific resources: Science has been one of the greatest casualties of the reform programme.
 Severe fiscal constraints have forced governments to reduce drastically budgetary allocations to research institutions, leaving most of these institutions with little or no source of revenues to support their activities.
 High priority must be given to developing a detailed plan for preservation of the scientific research infra structure during the difficult transition period and for restructuring it so that it can be integrated effectively into the emerging market system.
 The drain of talents must be stopped by a concerted national effort to exploit each country's competitive advantage in science by marketing these capabilities internationally, and particularly by linking up with other countries in the region and with developing countries that can most benefit from the region's scientific and technological capabilities.
 Search for a New Model
 Ironically, despite all the international debate about transition, thus far the actual goal of the transition process has never been clearly spelled out.
 It is widely presumed to be to some form of capitalist system, but which variety ‚Äì the Swedish?

"You mean that was really him in my dreams?"
 "Indeed.
 That's part of why he was so concerned you might be a powerful Fir'shan posing as a normal human."
 A tiny sound just outside the door preempted my next question.
 Alec carefully maneuvered a pair of huge metal baskets in through the door.
 I felt my eyes go wide as I realized that they were full of hundreds of cans of food.
 I didn't even want to guess at how much weight was in each basket, but as Alec cleared the door it was obvious that the slow speed that he'd been moving at had only been due to him not wanting to hit anything.
 He moved like they weighed no more than a couple of pillows as he crossed the cabin and set them down in front of what must be the food pantry.
 "That was almost as quick as normal."
 Alec nodded in response to Mallory's observation.

Any amount of ridicule would be worthwhile if it meant being able to stay with Alec.
 He obviously still wasn't convinced though.
 "Adri, you don't understand.
 This is the only way to keep you safe.
 I can't protect you here.
 I can't even protect my own family."
 He was still trying to disengage my arms from around his neck, but it was obvious he didn't want to hurt me, and I was holding on with everything I had.
 "No,¬†you¬†don't understand.
 This whole time I thought I was in love with Brandon, I didn't even know him.

"Rick," she breathed, her hands sliding to his neck, squeezing, pulling him to her.
 His mouth covered hers, his kiss slow and hot and thorough.
 She wrapped her arms around him, trying to get closer to him.
 When he raised his head, she whimpered, wanting his mouth on hers again.
 But she gasped with pleasure as he began nibbling on her earlobe.
 Rick wanted to do much more than kiss her, and she was making it difficult to resist.
 He'd never held a woman so eager, so responsive to his slightest touch.
 But he had to stop.
 He had to stop now.
 He raised his head, straightening and pulling away.

Rick felt awful, but he didn't know if he felt worse for himself or for her.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he told her, scooting closer and putting his arms around her tentatively.
 When she didn't resist, he drew her closer.
 "I'm sorry.
 I wish I knew what to do to help you."
 "Stop being so nice to me," she sobbed into his shoulder.
 "What?"
 he asked, bending his head closer to hers.
 "Stop being so nice to me!"
 He frowned.

I stood and Dino directed me to approach him.
 He was obviously drunk and I could see the usual crazed look in his eyes.
 He started rambling something about how I didn‚Äôt like him or respect him and I quickly claimed I did.
 I was a lanky fifteen year old, probably about 5‚Äô8‚Äô, 140 pounds.
 He stepped towards me as I obeyed his wish for me to come to him.
 He hit me so fast I didn‚Äôt see it coming, and I flew backwards onto the desktop.
 All four legs of the desk broke beneath the impact of my body.
 I lay there stunned on my back.
 As Dino walked towards me I could see the crowd of guests rushing in behind him.
 He straddled me and I gathered my legs towards my chest with my arms crossed in front of my face to protect myself.

"I'm not as red as I was last Saturday."
 "Do you-do you want me to-to rub some on you?"
 He glanced up, on the verge of asking her why, since it was only his arms, not his back, that needed the lotion.
 Instead, he silently handed her the bottle.
 Marie squeezed some lotion into her hand.
 Starting at his wrist, she rubbed his arm, working her way up.
 When she reached the tan line where his sleeve began, her hands glided up to the red spot just below his neck.
 "You-you must not have put sunscreen here.
 It's really red."
 He gazed at her averted face as she rubbed lotion on his chest.

But no--she was dead!
 The agony of that realization pierced his numbed heart.
 This was 2011; she'd gone back to 1927, been reunited with her family, probably gotten married and had children.
 Now she was dead.
 And she'd lived her life without him.
 Tears ran down his cheeks.
 The thought was too painful to bear.
 Around 1:00 he dragged himself upstairs, even though he knew he'd be unable to sleep.
 He took three Advil and lay down, throwing his arm over his eyes.
 He dozed fitfully, finally coming wide awake just after 6:00.

The staff moved faster and with more control that one could follow.
 Doi‚Äôvan finished the exhibition with the staff swinging over his shoulder and with a savage swing downward, ending with perfect control where it would have connected with a fallen opponent.
 Rodregas almost pointed out that he was doing Kata, practicing against an opponent only seen in your mind, but decided that this was the time for him to learn and Doi‚Äôvan to teach.
 Rodregas had long ago learned that it was hard to learn if you were talking.
 Over the next hour Rodregas began to regret his decision to learn.
 Doi‚Äôvan was clearly a master with the staff which Rodregas could not help but be impressed by.
 In the Eastern Realms, and every other kingdom that he knew of, the staff was a peasant weapon.
 As many lords only allowed swords to be for their soldiers and nobility.
 Farmers and crafts people were not allowed to own edged weapons of war.
 Though Rodregas had known such rules to be broken by non-noble families, it was done discretely, usually for keeping a family heirloom.

As the flares finally died, the pulsing pressure, the pins and needles disappeared as well.
 Only that wasn't quite the term for it.
 The power, the energy that'd become more than oppressive, was sucked towards Alec and Brandon, dragging with it my strength, and the unnatural vitality of the rest of the pack.
 I felt a lance of pain sink into my back, mirroring the jolt in my ankle, as all five shape shifters collapsed around me.
 I knew with a certainty I was going to die, that we were all going to die, but that didn't matter.
 It was only right that my existence cease within heartbeats of Alec's.
 Chapter 31 As the normal grogginess of sleep wore off, I realized just how thirsty I was.
 I reached for a drink, hissing a little as my stitches pulled against the still-healing skin, but the glass of orange juice remained steadfastly just beyond my fingertips.
 Alec appeared immediately, paint-speckled and undeniably alive, from where he'd been working in his studio.

Total fertilizer consumption by developing countries is expected to double by 2010.
 Furthermore, replacing macro-nutrients lost during intensive cultivation does not compensate for the depletion of more than a dozen micro-nutrients that also determine the quantity and quality of crops.
 Even in such agriculturally diverse countries as the United States and India, it has been demonstrated that better management of micro-nutrients can raise productivity substantially ‚Äì in some intensively cultivated areas by as much as 50 to 100 per cent or more in a wide variety of crops ‚Äì without significant changes in the structure or method of cultivation.
 Greater attention is needed to conserving and applying organic sources of manure and raising nitrogen-fixing crops, as well as to the use of bio-fertilizers.
 Unlike the creation of new irrigated lands, the application of such environmentally sustainable field practices is neither very costly nor technology-intensive, and can be widely propagated through improvements in agricultural training and extension.
 Increasing exports
 Over the next six years, the agreements reached during the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations are expected to reduce the tariffs levied by the industrial nations on agricultural products by 37 per cent and on tropical food exports by 43 per cent.
 Developing countries will cut agricultural tariffs by an average of 24 per cent.
 In addition, North American and Western European countries have agreed to cut agricultural subsidies by one-third.
 Together these cuts are expected to result in a 20 per cent rise in exports of agricultural and processed foods by 2005.

Under normal circumstances we'd be able to determine whether or not they'd been here in the last few days, but the rainstorm last night was strong enough to wash away all of that."
 Alec waited patiently as I tried to get a grip on myself.
 As soon as I nodded he disappeared through the door.
 A few seconds later he was back.
 "It's safe; there's no trace of them."
 He held the door open for me, and then slipped outside.
 "You need to erase any evidence that you weren't here all night.
 Take a shower, change into some of your own clothes, and then go to sleep.
 We'll keep watch outside until your mom gets back."
 I opened my mouth to ask what would happen after that, but he was already gone, moving so quickly through the darkness that I wasn't even sure which direction he'd headed.

 She drew comfort from his embrace for a few minutes.

‚ÄúStay here,‚Äù he ordered me.
 He gestured toward Steed, who turned to follow him outside.
 I wasn‚Äôt sure how long they‚Äôd be gone; I went to one of the narrow windows on the front wall and peered cautiously out.
 They were nowhere to be seen, but the sights of the village distracted me quickly enough.
 It was so unlike home.
 Night gave the gray stones an even darker appearance, the firelight glinting off their ragged edges like polished onyx.
 Torches lit each walkway and building.
 It seemed late, but several villagers were still outside, loud and boisterous.
 Nearly everyone dressed in black, a few of the men bearing large silver breastplates or wrist cuffs.
 Most wore leather, laced tight against thick, muscled frames.

Today, I was fully prepared to acknowledge Britney as the spoiled, self-centered brat she was.
 The bell rang and then Mrs. Campbell's lecture was over in record time.
 I even finished my assignment a good ten minutes before class was scheduled to end.
 I was absently sketching what I expected the inside of the opera house to look like, when a tap on my shoulder pulled me out of my reverie.
 "I'm so sorry, Mrs. Campbell.
 I finished early, but I should have started on one of the catch-up assignments.
 I just didn't want to get into a whole new subject with only ten minutes left."
 Her smile was much more understanding than normal for a classroom situation.
 It took the sting out of the words that were probably just for the people close enough to overhear.
 "Don't you worry, Miss Paige, I'll let you know when I don't think you're keeping up.

 Ahead of us were four doors, each with a symbol I couldn‚Äôt see from here.
 Crystalla stopped and faced us.
 ‚ÄúFind the door with your symbol on it.‚Äù ‚ÄúUh,‚Äù Jason raised his hand sheepishly, ‚Äúhow do we know which symbol is ours?‚Äù She smiled.
 ‚ÄúYou will know.‚Äù She motioned for us to move up to the doors.
 I walked slowly and leaned forward to see the symbol.
 Amazingly, I walked right up to the one with an arrow on it.
 I looked to the left and saw a door with a sword on it.
 I sighed and pushed open my door.
 The small room also had glass ceilings but they were dimmer.

Laura was the other first-period office monitor.
 They skipped down the halls, holding hands and laughing.
 Laura held classroom doors open.
 Eric swooped in with his arms extended like wings, softly humming the Hallelujah chorus from Handel‚Äôs Messiah.
 Sunday Kemper was Lane Campbell's new girl.
 She lived a block from our school.
 Her folks either enjoyed our company or preferred to have their daughter at home even if she brought the whole gang with her.

"We'll get something to eat in San Diego.

 They had two days left, and Marie chose to spend Thursday wandering around downtown Los Angeles, buying trinkets in the shops and the Farmer's Market on Fairfax and watching glamorous people walk by as she and Rick ate lunch at an outdoor caf√© on Rodeo Drive.
 But her choice for their last day in California was quite a change from that: she wanted to go to Disneyland.
 Mickey Mouse hadn't been around in 1927, and she found the whole idea of a fantasy land for children exciting.
 And she loved Splash Mountain.
 "Are you sad to be leaving?"
 Rick asked that evening as he watched her pack.
 "Yes.

 Jeremiah Stoutmire walked through the village of Cornrows, the hair on his neck erect.
 The cool spring breeze was weak compared to the ice that locked his spine.
 He held a torch in one hand and a shortsword in the other.
 At first, he had thought himself foolish waking in a full panic from a nightmare he could not remember.
 Then he saw others about, lit torches in their hands, and he knew his fear was justified.

‚ÄúThe Guild is supposed to be trying to make their Immortalists members Celestial.

 ‚ÄúTrust me, I would like to know that answer more then you.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs smile was now long gone and with a shrug of his huge misshaped shoulders, he changed the subject.
 ‚ÄúSo, Imeralda, the stone here still seems strong and like new, though clearly, it has been long after the construction of this place.‚Äù She was looking at Doi‚Äôvan strangely and it seemed to take her a moment to shift gears and answer his question.
 ‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶of course construction like this‚Ä¶stone enchanted to absorb the power‚Ä¶it makes the stone stronger with that power.
 Stones formed like this will last as long as the ley line does not move, which happens only rarely and over centuries.

The unemployment rate for ten Eastern European countries now averages around 17 per cent.
 Recent projections indicate that jobless ness in Russia could reach 15 million persons or 18 per cent of the work-force in the near future.
 By far the most serious problem lies in the developing world, where unemployment rates average 40‚Äì50 per cent in many countries.
 In Latin America, 192 million people representing 46 per cent of the population live under the poverty line, and 22 per cent of them are considered ‚Äòextremely poor‚Äô.
 Urban unemployment is around 8 per cent, but average industrial wages in the region fell by 17.5 per cent during the 1980s and the number of workers in the lower-wage informal sector doubled.
 Although population growth has slowed, a 72 per cent increase in labour participation rates for women is causing the work force to continue to expand rapidly.
 This region needs to double its employment growth rate to create 89 million new jobs during the 1990s in order to provide full employment opportunities for all its people.
 In sub-Saharan Africa, home to 20 of the 25 poorest nations in the world, urban unemployment afflicts some 14 million people, representing 15‚Äì20 per cent of the workforce, and is projected to more than double in the next ten years.
 Typically, youth comprise 65 to 75 per cent of the total unemployed.
 With the region‚Äôs population still growing at 3 per cent annually, these countries need to create 100 million new jobs in the coming decade just to maintain their present levels of unemployment.

I was helping out an undersized freshman who was having a really hard time understanding the fundamental concepts of the unit she was going to be tested over tomorrow when Mrs. Campbell stopped by.
 "We're all done.
 Wait until the end of your normal shift, and then go home.
 If anyone complains feel free to suggest that they don't leave it until the last minute next time."
 There was plenty of grumbling when I announced that the lab was over, but nobody actually said anything.
 Rachel was waiting for me at the door as everyone else filed out.
 She looked up guiltily as I made my way over to her.
 "Did you have a good day?
 I haven't seen that many people here ever."
 If there was one thing that'd always pissed me off, it was people who refused to own up to their mistakes.

Every so often I'd try to make it through Victor Hugo's weighty classic, but so far I'd never made it past Marius' introduction.
 Having just finished up Pride and Prejudice for the third time, I was once again due to try and make it through the written inspiration to some of my favorite music.
 I hardly noticed the slow journey into town, instead caught up in a different time and place as Valjean's story started to unfold.
 All too soon, the bus pulled up to a medium-sized, two-story brick building, and five kids my age stood up to leave.
 I followed them, my heart beating a little faster with each step.
 Other kids were trickling over to the door, either from one of the other two buses, or from the smattering of cars in the parking lot.
 Before we'd even made it inside I'd realized just how much I stuck out.
 Shorts seemed to be the order of the day, knee-length khakis for the boys, and everything from mid-thigh on up for the girls.
 The only people in jeans seemed to be the debate-club types.
 Silently groaning at my fashion faux pas, I located a sign pointing towards the office, and slipped around a couple of jocks who paused in their manly mock boxing match just long enough to check out the new girl.

"Sure, I'd love to.
 Mrs. North again?"
 I ignored the spate of nasty looks shot my way, gathered my books, accepted the bundle of papers, and hurried off to the stairs.
 It was later than last time, so unless I was quick the bell was going to ring before I made it back down the stairs.
 The congestion was bad in the halls, but for some reason it was twice as bad around stairs.
 Apparently I was hurrying just a little too fast.
 I tripped just before I hit the first step, and almost went crashing down the flight that led to the basement.
 Luckily I was just quick enough to grab the banister and save myself from a broken neck.
 I didn't quite manage to avoid twisting my ankle though, so I limped all the way up to the second floor.
 Trying to be as casual as possible, I looked into the art room as I hobbled by, but they'd rearranged their stations, and someone's easel was in the way now.

However, the overall impact of manufactured exports from developing countries has been vastly exaggerated.
 Exports by the Newly Industrializing Economies to the United States have risen from 1.1 to 2.1 per cent of US GNP over the past decade.
 America‚Äôs share of trade with low-wage countries represents only 3 per cent of GDP, compared to 2 per cent in 1960.
 For the OECD as a whole, imports from low-wage countries represent only 1.5 per cent of total expenditure on goods and services.
 On the other hand, there is irrefutable evidence that expanding international trade creates large numbers of jobs, even in high-wage economies.
 The real issue, therefore, is whether the overall balance favours net job creation or net job destruction for each nation and for the global economy.
 On this issue the evidence is clear.
 Protectionism reduces overall economic welfare, often hurting those with the lowest incomes.
 In the long term greater international trade, like technology, expands overall employment opportunities substantially.
 Trade also counters the tendency of prices to increase along with incomes in more developed countries.

His expression softened a little as he reached into the small bag mounted on the fuel tank, and handed me a bottle of water.
 I hadn't even realized I was thirsty until that second.
 "I'm sorry, Adriana.
 I know I can depend on you, this is just important enough that I needed to make sure you understood what's riding on your discretion."
 I finished with the first third of the bottle, and then nodded.
 "I won't say anything.

 "Not a what, but a who."
 Much like he'd done when we'd been fleeing from my house, Alec picked me up and then slung me around so I could wrap my legs around his waist, and my arms around his neck and chest.
 This time Alec wasn't sprinting, but he still set out at a pace that made conversation impossible, so I just relaxed into him and enjoyed being so close for a second time today.

In a misguided effort to sprinkle flowers over the gravesite ceremony, they have terrified everyone (except Grandpa).
 Most of the crowd starts to realize what is actually happening.
 The door of the helicopter slides shut and it rises into the air above crowds who lie on their bellies or who have taken off running through the cemetery but one old man, who remains standing with his arms still raised.
 The crowd begins to rise and a collective chuckle begins to infect the crowd as we all realize what we have just experienced.

 In the aftermath of this circus funeral, my mother discovered that Dino had borrowed (or conned) a great deal of money from his father, and Dino‚Äôs siblings were angry and wanted it repaid by my mother.
 The Greek family rumor was that my mother was sitting on a stash of smuggled diamonds and should sell them and repay the loan.

She smiled then.
 "Can we watch television today?"
 That pleasure was only one of many that day.
 First she loaded the dishwasher while Rick supervised, and she poured in the soap and started the machine herself.
 After a shower, she had lessons on the use of the food processor, the blender, and--delight of delights--the microwave oven.
 "I can make lunch now," she proclaimed happily.
 "Do you like to cook?"
 "Yes."
 But her face fell.

‚ÄúDid you need something?‚Äù asked Imeralda.
 Rodregas had not realized that she had noticed him watching her.
 There was a tease to her voice and expression that said she knew what he was thinking and that she did not mind.
 Rodregas was an experienced man but he was not sure if he had ever seen a woman as beautiful as her, much less thought that he ever had a chance with such a woman.
 He had to smile, amused by his own reaction, as he felt his heartbeat speed up and a rush of heat.
 He had not felt such hormonal surges in a long time.
 He made a decision in his head.
 He had carefully been a gentleman now for several weeks and had not tried anything with the beautiful half AElf, but her teasing expression left him an opening.
 He decided to take advantage of it.
 He spoke very slowly and carefully, letting her know that he knew what he was saying.

See if  you can find out who people want to win and why?‚Äù Imeralda was clearly confused by the odd request, but nodded, and after a little talk she slipped away to the food line and within moments was in an animated discussion with a few squires at another table.
 Rodregas thought Doi‚Äôvan might ask, but he showed no interest and instead said, ‚ÄúWhile most of the knights are too high and mighty to talk to a Hellborn, the staff is not so closed mouthed.
 The greater sigils are said to be guarded twenty four hours a day in a great chamber in the very heart of the Cathedral.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd did you ask if sworn men were allowed in with a new knight?‚Äù asked Rodregas with a smile.
 ‚ÄúActually the topic did come up,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan with a chuckle like rocks in a land slide.
 ‚ÄúWhile guards are usually not allowed in, it is not unusual for close friends or advisors to go in with some of those of the blood; to share their wisdom on the best possible greater sigils to take on.‚Äù ‚ÄúI will assume,‚Äù said Rodregas, ‚Äúthat they had never heard of a Nymph entering the chamber, much less one of the Hellborn?‚Äù ‚ÄúAElves are not uncommon and actually more Orqui than I expected.
 One servant thought that Nymphs used to go in during his father‚Äôs, father‚Äôs time, but not any time recently.
 No one could even imagine a Hellborn going into the Chamber,‚Äù agreed Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúWell as far behind as we are, we might not even get the chance to try to bully our way in,‚Äù Rodregas said.
 Doi‚Äôvan nodded and that comment seemed to end the conversation.
 As Rodregas headed out to the sands of the Cathedral arena for the jousting match, he was relieved to see Imeralda waiting at the entrance to talk to him.

That year, the Yankees won in five games.
 The following week my mom stayed home from her job, teaching eighth-grade English.
 Her headache was so wicked, she grimaced and groaned.
 I tried to coax her to the doctor.
 She said he had already given her pain pills, which was all he could do.
 Then I came home from school and found her lying in a heap beside her bed.
 Breathing in shallow puffs, eyes open and watery.
 Above the right eye was a long gash, already scabbed over.
 I suspected a prowler had clubbed her and swiped her few items of jewelry.
 But she managed a goofy smile and mumbled that she must‚Äôve fallen, and getting up had seemed too hard to bother with.

‚ÄúYou're so annoying.
 You can add that to the list.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou just love to insult me,‚Äù Seth grinned.
 ‚ÄúIs it your new hobby?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt will be if you keep annoying me,‚Äù I fought the urge to punch him again.
 He just rolled his eyes at me.
 He really is the most annoying person I've ever met besides Emily and myself.
 Wow, he was going to have us both beat.
 ‚ÄúI'm sorry to interrupt your playful banter, but are we actually looking for a place in particular or just some random cave?‚Äù Emily's annoyed voice asked us from behind.
 ‚ÄúYes, just a random cave or a place to stay.
 Why?‚Äù Seth asked, just as annoyed.
 ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúa cave won't be found in a forest, so shouldn't we be finding a way out of the forest?‚Äù ‚ÄúI know that, Emily,‚Äù he said and pointed to the trees.

Clumsiness, lack of skill, never quite fitting in.
 What took me by surprise was the betrayal I felt.
 All the years I‚Äôd lived in the village, I‚Äôd never counted on anyone the way I had done with this group, Chevelle especially.
 The feeling in my chest was so thick and heavy it burned.
 Struggling with my reactions kept me distracted from the ride.
 It was steep now, rocky, a haze hanging in the few spiky trees.
 When we stopped for the evening, the men quietly set up a perimeter.
 Except for Chevelle.
 He was watching me as I glared back at him.
 Why had I expected more from him?

It was the first time I was aware that I had strong magic.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan paused then added, ‚ÄúThey seem to think I was a great catch, and I think Taiga wanted a lot of money for me.

 His voice, for the first time, seemed totally serious and very professional.
 The three companions shared a blank look.
 The two men turned to Imeralda who simply asked the question, ‚ÄúJordaan, you know I have had little magical training.
 I have been more of a prized blood mare than a wizard and these other two are warriors.
 I don‚Äôt think any of us know what ‚ÄòThe One Law‚Äô is.
 Jordaan looked surprised, but then nodded.
 ‚ÄúIt is a law set forth by both the Celestials and the Infernals.

 He hurried the words of a spell as Velixar turned.
 An incorporeal hand shot from Qurrah‚Äôs own, flying across the battlefield to where an elf dove toward them, arrows flashing two at a time in the starlight.
 The hand struck the elf in the chest, freezing flesh and eviscerating his insides with ice.
 The flying horse banked upward as its master fell limp into the fog.
 ‚ÄúBeautiful, Qurrah,‚Äù Velixar said, bloodlust burning in his red eyes.
 His precious undead were being massacred.
 He could feel their numbers dwindling in his mind, now but a third of what his glorious army had been.

However, it was only long enough to catch my breath and then it was back tenfold.
 I writhed in agony.
 Nothing they did would help.
 I could not control my magic; it shattered most of the things on the nearby table and twice caught the bedding afire.
 The elders were frantic, which only frightened me more.
 I had never seen them agitated.
 This carried on for hours.
 My hair and clothing were drenched in sweat and I was near surrender.
 And then, with no more warning than when the first pains came, it was over.
 A small, sweet child was in my arms.

He was still going plenty fast, but at least the wind wasn't deafening.
 After a few minutes of white-knuckled fear, I was finally able to relax a little, and enjoy the feeling of having Brandon so close while the wind tossed my hair back and forth.
 The other girls were studiously ignoring me while they gossiped back and forth about everyone from underclassmen to teachers and other adults in the town.
 I didn't want to join in the gossip, and Brandon was sprawled out on the pickup bed with his eyes closed.
 I settled for contemplating the glorious sunset's myriad colors.
 We passed some kind of border into one of the parks.
 Vincent slowed down a little more as I was busy taking in the incredible pinks and purples that were dominating the western sky.
 It was like someone had splashed glowing paint across a window and then gone back and painted in picture-perfect clouds to complete the scene.
 I'd seen plenty of amazing sunsets back home, but there was something about the rugged, almost hostile, skyline here that gave this one a spectacular level of depth.
 Maybe Mom was right about the west after all.

Feeling like a traitor, I headed my skittering thoughts off before they could start affecting me physically, and focused on the next step in getting ready.
 There was a lot more at stake this morning than last night.
 If I fell apart now I might not make it to school, and then I'd have all kinds of trouble calming Mom back down when she returned from wherever she'd gone.
 My hair hung as limp and straight as always.
 No amount of styling ever made it look any better, just more contrived.
 Makeup was the same way.
 A touch here or there made me look marginally better, but I sincerely envied the girls who were skilled enough to transform their faces into something breathtaking after a session in the bathroom.
 Mom wasn't any help.
 Most days she didn't even put on mascara.
 With the most depressing part of my routine now done, my mind wandered forward.

"No, please.
 It was entirely my fault.
 I shouldn't have tried to squeeze past you like that."
 The smile was still there.
 That had to be a good sign.
 Usually when people said something nice and didn't mean it their smiles only lasted as long as they were speaking.
 I tried a tentative smile in return and his widened slightly.
 "I'm Brandon."
 Feeling more than a little nervous, I allowed him to capture my right hand in his.
 "I'm Adr...Adriana."

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúuse the magic.
 Feel it.‚Äù I nodded and he returned his gaze to our hands, now both connected.
 He couldn‚Äôt have been much older than I, but his hands dwarfed mine and it made me feel suddenly, fleetingly, like a child again.
 A spark lit at the hem of my left sleeve and slowly worked its way up my arm.
 I wanted the fire off me, needed it put out.
 When I concentrated on that, the flame flickered.
 It flared again and Chevelle squeezed my hands; I had to be able to do this.
 I focused hard on the base of the flame as it wavered and then fell back toward the hem, where it finally choked off.
 I glanced up at Chevelle.
 He looked pleased.

They made temporary shelter in a cave, likely for just one night, and continued again.
 They must have moved slowly, and I could see they stopped often to rest.
 It didn‚Äôt take long before I‚Äôd found their new camp.
 I slipped into a tall tree to watch them.
 To my shock, I found something I had never seen before.
 I watched for hours before I was sure, too stunned to believe it possible.
 I had heard stories, the fairies were always puffing dust about it, but I‚Äôd never believed it.
 Was I really watching humans?
 I was pulled from reading, confused.

These were trim and fit, made for traveling.
 Not that I knew where I was going.
 My desire to trail Chevelle had been smashed, but there was no way I could return to the village.
 I glanced around.
 Still no sign of the watchers as I slid my shoes on.
 I should have kept running during the night, but I‚Äôd been too exhausted.
 There was a pack in the pile as well, but I didn‚Äôt have anything aside from a soaking wet dress.
 I stretched it over a low branch to dry, and the pouch I had hidden before the trial fell free.
 I sat on the rock, picking up the small, weathered bag.
 I‚Äôd carried it for days now and still didn‚Äôt know what was inside.

I settled for just nodding as I swapped books and slammed my locker shut.
 Alec pursed his lips for a second and then nodded, not at me, but at whatever decision he'd just made.
 "We'd better get you to your next class.
 Dealing with that will have to wait until later."
 I wanted to ask what he meant, but the halls were already full of other students, and I was pretty sure he'd tell me when he was ready and not a moment sooner anyways.
 With a sigh, I followed him into the crowd.
 A few minutes later I'd been handed off to my next babysitter, James this time, and was safely ensconced in Mr. Whethers' class.
 Mr. Whethers looked more than a little confused after reading James' note, but he simply added James' name to his roll, and then absently waved the two of us towards seats.
 I would've enjoyed English if not for the wildfire buzz created by my little scene with Alec outside of Biology.
 Mr. Whethers repeatedly asked various clumps of giggling and or staring girls to be quiet, but his efforts were largely wasted.

Either way, my biggest hope would be that the guys can introduce their wives and girlfriends to Broken, and the girls can introduce their husbands and boyfriends to Torn.
 We've included excerpts for both Torn and Splintered (the sequel for Broken and Torn) below.
 Acknowledgments: A big thanks to all of the fans who are doing so much to help get the word out.
 There are tons of you that I don't know, but I do want to make special mention of a few dependable souls that I'm very grateful to know, and who've helped in various ways with Torn, and who I suspect will continue to go above and beyond with Broken.
 Cassy & Mark, I'm glad you both turned out to be story addicts just like me.
 Thanks for everything.
 Dad, not everyone gets to be best friends with their parents.
 Thanks for all of the feedback and the ongoing support.
 Mimi, thanks for sticking with me long enough to get addicted and to fix some of my biology facts along the way.
 As always, Katie deserves special thanks.

"I'm sorry."
 Partly for him but mostly for herself.
 What would he say if he knew that she sometimes went to a speakeasy?
 He'd probably kill her.
 Davis, having missed the irony in her tone, took her hand.
 "Why don't we go back to your house and listen to the radio?"
 That idea appealed to her very much.
 Her parents were out, so she and Davis would be alone.
 Normally, she wouldn't dare be alone at home with a man--her father would be furious.
 But he trusted Davis with her.

He was surprised that he was not more tired; maybe his new body handled such things better and could make do with less sleep.
 He was usually a light sleeper and was very surprised that they had been able to get the drop on him.
 His guess was that the AElf maiden had cast some sort of spell on him to mask their approach, and he kept a close eye on her to make sure she did not repeat the effort.
 Of course she was also very nice to look at, so he did not need much of an excuse to enjoy the view.
 In the morning, he slowly pulled out some of the supplies and bundled them.
 He tried not to show how much he hurt.
 The wound might not kill him, but every movement hurt.
 He also handed Audrian a few of his coins.
 It wasn‚Äôt much, but it would get them started; they were lucky he was being so generous.
 Rodregas felt he owed them, and if he had been in their place he would have tried to kill Ravenhurr.

Whatever stayed here, there were a lot of them.
 Near the center of the camp the ground was beat down with tracks, circling a ring of stones.
 I found remnants inside, and ashes.
 A crude fire pit.
 Around that, several feet out, were various logs, I assumed for sitting around the pit for warmth.
 A few huts were situated about the camp but their construction was unlike anything I‚Äôd seen before, very poorly built.
 I ducked inside one and was shocked to see it was full of possessions.
 Clothing, bedding, so much left behind.
 I had thought they‚Äôd departed suddenly, but I was confident then that it was not of their choosing.
 I went back outside and examined the tracks again.

 She sprayed the car, but no rainbow appeared, so she adjusted the nozzle to make a wider spray.
 Inspired by the fine drops that shot out, she pointed the nozzle straight into the air.

She has been an inspiration for me and making her happy is the goal of my life.
 We are best friends, confidants, partners, and true lovers and together we are one.
 I can‚Äôt imagine my existence without her, and I know that everything I am and all I will become is shaped by her genuine kindness.
 Meeting Lisa is the most important defining moment in my life.
 Acknowledgments I would like to thank all of the drug and alcohol rehabilitation professionals who choose to tackle the daunting task of attempting to help those in this world who cannot take just one drink but must consume the whole bottle and those who cannot take a prescription pill as prescribed but must crush, snort, smoke or inject these powerful drugs to feed the monster of addiction.
 Many of these counselors and staff who help the addicts in our lives were once addicts themselves.
 They choose to ‚Äúgive back‚Äù because they have either finally come to understand what caused them to want to destroy themselves and are compelled to share this knowledge or they know that they can only continue their sobriety by staying where they found it, or both.
 Either way, they are the students who became the teachers of recovery and only they are bullet proof to the lies that flow so freely from an addict‚Äôs mouth.
 I would like to thank the staff of Narconon and every other facility that helps our addicts attempt to identify and handle the demon they cannot resist.
 I would like to thank Chris Tillman for encouraging me to turn my cathartic writings into a book to share my story with others.

"What else is a girl to do?"
 Alec's reply shrug mirrored mine exactly and yet still turned the movement into something far more graceful and eloquent than what I'd managed.
 "Be that as it may, I think you don't give yourself enough credit for just how amazing you are."
 I felt myself start to blush as Alec disappeared into the bathroom.
 ** Monsters I could handle, motorcycles were something else entirely.
 I'd almost backed out when Alec told me we'd be taking his bullet bike, but I didn't want him to know I really was a complete wuss.
 All of which explained how I'd ended up on Alec's shiny, blue Yamaha R1 with my arms locked around him in a death grip.
 Apparently I'd given away at least some of my fear though, because Alec took the first half of our forty-minute drive at a positively sedate pace, or at least what qualified as a sedate pace on a machine that could go from zero to sixty much faster than any of the exotic sports cars Alec and his friends usually drove.
 Just as I finally started to enjoy leaning with Alec while zipping around turns at what I was starting to suspect were triple digit speeds, he pulled off behind a ramshackle, old building and held a finger to his lips.
 I held my breath and tried my best to try and figure out what he was listening for, but encased as I was by the blue helmet he'd insisted on, I would've been lucky to notice if a herd of elephants had been hot on our trail.

 ‚ÄúJazell!‚Äù Seth yelled, but his voice was muffled by the dirt flying everywhere.
 I grabbed at something, anything, but there was no hold.
 ‚ÄúSeth, where are you?‚Äù I thought that he said something but, I couldn't hear him.
 All I could hear was the blood pounding in my ear and my racing heartbeat.
 Dirt fell into my mouth and I coughed, trying to get rid of it.

We had no furniture in that room.
 A boxing match would start with one person calling out another person to fight.
 You could decline but you would endure the collective shaming of the crowd.
 Several sets of boxing gloves were available and once both fighters had their gloves on, the games would begin.
 Cowering in a corner was never a good strategy as the crowd only pushed you back to the center.
 The room erupted when the action was good and the fights were a scrappy version of actual boxing.
 The fight was over when you surrendered or you were knocked out.
 I fought many times and I do not remember ever losing.
 As I said, I had grown up facing a much tougher opponent than anyone in the room.
 I was rarely injured because I had learned to protect myself from the powerful blows of my stepfather and I knew how to look for an opening and drop my opponent.

So how are you going to save your friends?‚Äù I didn't know what it was talking about until I looked over.
 Seth was stiff and frozen, his eyes following one of the snake creatures that was climbing its way up his leg.
 It twisted itself around his arm and brushed onto his neck.
 Seth swung his sword at the back of the snake but there was a flash and it sliced his arm instead.
 He winced and dropped his weapon.
 The snake had wrapped around his neck and was squeezing.
 I gripped my knife but stopped when the creature snickered from the ground.
 ‚ÄúI wouldn't do that if I were you,‚Äù it said.
 ‚ÄúThat wouldn't be wise.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I demanded.
 ‚ÄúIt wouldn't be right to help Seth?‚Äù It hissed in laughter.

I wrung my hair out.
 ‚ÄúI agree and if we didn‚Äôt need them, I‚Äôd be planning their funeral.‚Äù Emily smiled, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be helping you.
 Do you think they would like pink coffins?‚Äù ‚ÄúTotally,‚Äù I laughed and grabbed my dry bag.
 ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go home.
 Want to crash at my place?‚Äù Emily flipped open her phone, her fingers danced on the keys and paused.
 Then they clicked and she shoved it in her pocket.
 ‚ÄúYup I can.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always one step ahead.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlways.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo what do you think we should do?‚Äù Emily asked from my bed later on.
 I swallowed the bit of strawberry that had been in my mouth.
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, ambush them back?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey might see that coming,‚Äù she pointed out, ‚Äúand it‚Äôs really obvious.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, they think we won‚Äôt do that because that is exactly what they would be expecting, so by actually doing it, we can trick them,‚Äù I rambled on and grabbed another strawberry.
 Emily tapped her lip with her pencil and straightened her pink pajamas.

Rodregas had not realized that she had noticed him watching her.
 There was a tease to her voice and expression that said she knew what he was thinking and that she did not mind.
 Rodregas was an experienced man but he was not sure if he had ever seen a woman as beautiful as her, much less thought that he ever had a chance with such a woman.
 He had to smile, amused by his own reaction, as he felt his heartbeat speed up and a rush of heat.
 He had not felt such hormonal surges in a long time.
 He made a decision in his head.
 He had carefully been a gentleman now for several weeks and had not tried anything with the beautiful half AElf, but her teasing expression left him an opening.
 He decided to take advantage of it.
 He spoke very slowly and carefully, letting her know that he knew what he was saying.
 ‚ÄúActually, I was looking at you, you are amazingly beautiful.

 The following night, Harruq slipped out into the street.
 Lamps were lit here and there, casting shadows across the road.
 Harruq stayed far from Celed, the elven side of town, since they sent all their children to be raised in Nellassar, deep in the heart of the Erze forest.
 It was the human children, especially the poor and the destitute, that Harruq sought.
 Of course, none would be out playing, not with so many dead and missing.
 He would need to take different measures.
 Not far from their home, a ratty building operated throughout the night.
 It was Maggie‚Äôs Place, half tavern and half orphanage.

The berries were wild, small and much less palatable without the guiding hand of an elf, but the water I‚Äôd gathered from the stream was cool and refreshing.
 As evening approached, so grew the underlying discomfort with the idea of the coming darkness.
 Not that I hadn‚Äôt spent my share of time alone at home, just not alone in the middle of a strange forest outside.
 I might have run through the night and slept at day, but it made little sense to struggle out of fear.
 It didn‚Äôt stop me from seeking out a decent shelter before nightfall, though.
 Slowing my pace, I gave the surroundings more attention.
 The strangeness of the land was a little shocking, and I had to surrender the idea of finding a proper tree.
 But a half mile or so later, I came upon a suitable hollow in a low embankment guarded by the curling roots of a sycamore.
 It wasn‚Äôt a bad start, but I gathered some shrubbery to cover the entryway, the bitter stench of its sharp green leaves giving me a little more security‚Äîor at least the feeling of it.
 The sun hadn‚Äôt set when I‚Äôd finished lining the floor with vines, but I went ahead and settled in, sitting so I could see through an opening in the frond-covered entry.

I flung my arms out to steady myself.
 Seth grinned at my clumsiness and waited for me to walk up to him.
 I wacked his head with the back of my hand, making his hair stick up.
 He smoothed it down and we walked across the flat ground.
 The ground had spots of grass sticking out of sand and rock.
 Luckily, there was no wind down here to toss up the sand and dirt.
 I think I passed the spot where the Kojas had stood in my dream.
 I threw the thoughts out of my head and tried to think of something else.
 Like, where this flat plain of flatness ended.
 ‚ÄúWhere are we going, anyway?‚Äù I asked and stared at the sky.

 "I love being with you, Marie.
 And I love seeing your excitement.
 Every time I see you get excited about a microwave or a dishwasher or a blacklight, it makes me want to think of something else I can show you or give you."
 Her heart tightened.
 "Thank you."

Britney was still upset.
 I, on the other hand, was extremely happy I'd made a good enough impression to get a job.
 I didn't like sitting there while Britney badmouthed Mrs. Campbell.
 I looked up during one of Britney's infrequent pauses for air, and caught Alec staring at me.
 Staring wasn't quite the right word though.
 Strangely enough, it didn't seem like he was necessarily mad, but he didn't seem happy either.
 I only caught his eyes for a few seconds before he looked away, but even his normally riveting blue eyes couldn't distract me from my inability to identify the look.
 I was used to people disliking me, ignoring me, or even occasionally liking me, but this was the first time I'd met someone who seemed to be still trying to decide what camp to join long past the time when most kids our age would have either made a decision or just decided I was weird and started ignoring me.
 Britney seemed to be getting suspicious that I wasn't really listening, so I had to make a lot of eye contact over the next few minutes.
 When I finally got a chance to look back up, Alec and his friends weren't at their table.

How dare you?‚Äù Then he said a single word and from his mouth poured a huge wind, Doi‚Äôvan flayed around trying to hold on to Van‚Äôdret, but he lost his grip and hit the ceiling hard.
 Rodregas crunched the fingers he was holding and heard them snap, even as he was being pushed away.
 With the snapping of the fingers the wind stopped.
 Rodregas then dropped the hand, grabbed Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs head and twisted.
 He remembered that day in Raven Tower when he had snapped Korin‚Äôs neck and his arms bunched up, his muscles rippling with the strain.
 Van‚Äôdret was an Immortalist.
 His neck did not snap easily, but it snapped.
 Rodregas did not stop snapping it until he had the man‚Äôs face looking into the rock below.
 The three sat there for a minute and then stepped away to rest against the far wall to get some distance from Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs body.
 After a few minutes Doi‚Äôvan said, ‚ÄúWell, one more Immortalist down, that‚Äôs good.‚Äù The other two nodded.

He was learning what it meant to work full days, to budget money, and generally act responsible.
 He meant to enroll in adult school and complete his senior year that way, meanwhile saving all he could toward the date of his graduation when he would go looking for some kind of apprentice white-collar job, maybe in another town.
 Probably San Francisco.
 Unless he got drafted.
 The way he talked was eerie and distressing, as if he meant to leave tomorrow and probably never come home.
 On his more effusive evenings, he might offer advice and wrest promises out of me.
 He asked for a promise that I would go straight to college, because a guy as smart as me simply ought to, and it would please my mom, who could use some cheering after her sorrows.
 He had witnessed how any talk of college made her glow.
 Besides, he didn‚Äôt want to see me get drafted.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd have a hell of a time in the service,‚Äù he said.

It forces higher-wage countries and their workers to specialize in technology-intensive and skill-intensive occupations that pay higher wages.
 At the same time, it also raises the wages of less-skilled jobs in low-wage countries by increasing the demand for workers to produce for overseas markets.
 The problem in the more developed countries is that the demand for low-skilled jobs declines and the gap in wages between skilled and unskilled jobs tends to increase, resulting in a decline in incomes and employment opportunities for lower levels of the population in these countries.
 This is a natural, healthy process of social development in which different sectors serve as engines for growth at different stages.
 The upward job displacement that earlier shifted job opportunities from agriculture to industry now shifts them to higher-skilled jobs in manufacturing and services.
 The negative side-effects of this process on some sections of the population alert us to areas where society must make special efforts to speed their development.
 As in the case of technology, research is needed to document this complex process across industries, between countries and over time.
 One product of these studies could be the development of specific job coefficients measuring the impact of growth in trade in different industries on overall employment.
 Trade becomes of even greater potential benefit to industrial nations during the coming decade when economic growth in these countries is expected to be significantly slower than in the developing world.
 The pent-up demand generated by the destruction of Europe during the Second World War, the rapid expansion of population during the baby boom generation, and the explosion of new technologies in the past few decades, all generated strong internal demand in the OECD countries, resulting in steady economic growth.

Jasmin's complete stillness was an eerie counterpoint to the waves of power still beating at me.
 I somehow knew she was just seconds away from springing when the sound of running footsteps caused all three to turn.
 Alec appeared around the corner, followed by Isaac, just a split second before Brandon sauntered into view from the opposite direction.
 The tingly feeling grew exponentially more powerful with so many more shape shifters present.
 Rubbing my arms did nothing to ward off the feeling that entire colonies of insects were skittering across my skin.
 Mr. Rindell's appearance forestalled what I'd been sure would turn into a full-blown fight.
 He sized up the situation with the canny eye of an educator who'd seen more fights over his career than most gang leaders.
 "Class is about to start, and if every one of you isn't where you're supposed to be before the bell rings, you'll have detention for the next month."

"You stopped breathing.
 What's wrong?"
 The tears his touch had dried up a few seconds before were back, and just seconds away from escaping the corners of my eyes by the time I finally pulled myself up onto my knees and managed to speak.
 "Please don't send me there.
 Not after my dream."
 There was just enough moonlight trickling into the room for me to see his expression change.
 My stomach seemed to reach up and wrap itself around my heart as I realized it was the expression he used when it was important to him that people not know what he was thinking.
 "I'm not sure that's the best idea."
 The tears finally made their escape as I crumpled back onto the bed.

His eyes open wider.
 Still in my dream, I'm back home when a postcard arrives, from Jack, who writes that he‚Äôs gone and found his daughter, Jan, who would otherwise also die young, and they‚Äôre going to live in peace, joy, and love, now and for eternity.
 And they might help save Neal Cassady.
 Shanghai
 While going through my boxes of Eric‚Äôs treasures, I find myself hoping that somehow God, in eternity, will bless Sylvia in spite of her meanness.
 I loved her, though in a guarded way.
 I tried to help her, and she gave me plenty in return, most of it dark, but nevertheless worth pondering.
 Each time we got together, we talked about books and ideas.
 Here is the conclusion of her favorite poem, "The Night They Burned Shanghai":
 Tonight Shanghai is burning, And we are dying too.

 I wasn‚Äôt mad at him anymore for not telling me what I wanted to know.
 Now I felt bad that I had nagged him so hard that he was breaking.

Considering the pattern of the past five weeks, Marie was thrilled when Davis told her that he was taking her out to dinner the next Friday evening.
 But it turned out to be completely unlike the night of their betrothal.
 Davis was in an abominable mood, complaining about the food, the service, even the color of the tablecloth.
 And he was too tired to go dancing after dinner.
 "Can we at least go for a walk by the river?"
 Marie asked as they left the restaurant.
 "I'm not up to it.
 I happen to have put in a long day of work while you were out with your friends.
 There's more to life than parties and shopping, Marie."
 "I'm sorry."

The question was rhetorical.
 Obviously, people acted so boorishly because they weren't as cool or enlightened as me.
 During mass, I considered the priest's accent monotonous and uninspired, as though after forty years of mouthing the same lines, it all sounded to him like blah blah blah.
 Attending Catholic services, communion tries my patience, as I'm not allowed to participate.
 But while a young woman read, ‚ÄúHe took bread, gave thanks and broke it and gave it to them, saying, ‚ÄòThis is my body given for you.
 Do this in remembrance .
 .
 .‚Äô‚Äù and the choir chanted, ‚ÄúSing hallelujah to the Lord‚Äù a breath of Spirit touched me.
 Through all the minutes while wafers got distributed, I heard a small voice reminding me that I ought to pluck the log out of my own eye.
 So I was slightly less mean by the time Mother Teresa walked to the altar.

The strongest dire animals are not just those of nearest descent, but also those who come to term in high magical environments.‚Äù Rodregas nodded, he had heard bits of this but he had not really thought about it.
 Doi‚Äôvan stretched his hands up and up to an impressive height, and a smile spread across his face, the first one Rodregas had seen on the Hellborn face.
 It was good to see, though it was also a little scary as his teeth were more pointed than Rodregas was used to seeing.
 His teeth had more in common with the Dire Cats than himself or Imeralda.
 ‚ÄúOf course, I know this first hand as it is the same for us Hellborn.
 We will not grow strong if we do not spend much of our childhood in a place that is rich in magic.
 This place feels very good.
 The last few years the only time I was in a place rich in magic, I was also a prisoner.
 It is good not to hunger for magic and be FREE!‚Äù Rodregas was, of course, curious about the Hellborn‚Äôs background but had been hesitant to ask.
 You do not want to piss off one of the Hellborn.

Rodregas and Doi‚Äôvan circled the chamber.
 Rodregas was not as familiar with the daemons of the Infernal Realms as he was the great beasts of the Celestial Realm.
 He sat looking at a wolf with the tail of a serpent but with large beautiful white wings.
 Then he slowly walked next to a great bull with bat wings and a head that appeared to be very human.
 While he had been drawn to the Chamber both figures repulsed him.
 They mocked the natural order.
 It was  not just that they seemed to combine multiple unconnected animals, but the size and shapes were simply wrong.
 Rodregas looked up from his examination of a strange bull daemon and looked for Doi‚Äôvan.
 He must have been more familiar with the powers of the various creatures.
 Doi‚Äôvan had walked past many of the figures until he stood at one toward the back.

No, blood.
 My nose was bleeding.
 It took a moment to get my bearings.
 My bed sheets were a tangle and my clothes were disheveled.
 It must have been a dream.
 I had fallen asleep looking at my mother‚Äôs pendant, trying to remember her, and somehow combined it with the disaster I had read of the northern clans.
 It was only a dream.
 Shaken, I sat up, struggling to collect myself.
 I reached up to remove the pendant from the hook and squeezed it tight in my fist.
 It felt good, like a connection, and I slid the leather chain over my head, pulling the pendant down to rest on my chest.

‚ÄúNo, what I _must_.‚Äù
 The words felt hollow, nothing more than self-serving lies.
 He kept remembering the mother with her young babe clutched to her breast as she fled from him.
 When he had rammed her, she had tucked the child to guard it from the fall.
 Right before the kill, she had held him, trying to protect him.
 ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù he asked.
 A part of him worried he might wake his brother, but he was too drained to care.
 ‚ÄúWhy did she do that?
 She could have run faster without the child!‚Äù
 No, he knew that answer.

‚ÄúSo, you do not deny it,‚Äù said Rodregas.
 ‚ÄúIt is not to a squire that I am going to either admit or deny such claims.

 Rodregas laughed and let Nordien see his smile.
 ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚Äúlet us see how well you will do in battle against an Immortalist.‚Äù With that, Rodregas simply charged.
 He dropped his poor mace and slammed into Nordien with all his speed and strength.
 Rodregas hit shield first, then instantly dropped his own shield, grabbed on to Nordien‚Äôs shield and ripped it out of his hands.
 Nordien‚Äôs mace was not just made of Night Bronze.
 It was clearly enchanted since the end glowed with an almost sick yellow color.
 It almost nailed him in the head.

Of course.
 He was testing me, making sure I was going to keep quiet about what he'd done.
 Probably because he didn't want any of the praise for such a selfless act.
 I was usually a pretty lousy liar, but it isn't really a lie if you both know the truth.

 Brandon looked at me for several seconds, and then chuckled.

He dismounted effortlessly and pulled me from my horse and into the building in a few quick steps, closing the door behind us.

I held up my math book with a look that I hoped conveyed how ridiculous she was being.
 "Oh, that's perfect.
 I don't understand any of this junk, so you can explain it to me now and then we won't have to spend as much time in that stupid tutoring lab."
 The old me would have told Britney she was a self-centered wench, but the new me, the one that was all too aware of how much it would suck to go through the next two years of school without a single friend, just forced my face into something approximating a smile and tried to explain why drawing something at random from a bag with replacement was different than drawing something from a bag without replacement.
 It was a fairly straightforward concept that we'd seen twice now.
 I was pretty sure Britney was capable of understanding, she just didn't care, which was the one thing virtually guaranteed to make me mad.
 Stupidity was bad enough; laziness would be a hundred times worse.
 Still, by the second time through I'd clarified a couple of points I'd been a little fuzzy on, and was almost ready to believe Britney might actually apply herself to listening.
 I was so caught up in what I was doing, and the ever-so-slowly growing light of interest in Britney's eyes, that the rest of the class had fallen silent for a full twenty seconds before the drop in noise registered for me.

 It took a while for her to get the hang of it, but an hour or so later, she was cruising around the parking lot, making reasonably smooth starts and stops.

 It seemed like he was giving orders though, and that they weren't being received very well.
 A few minutes later Alec bundled me into the back seat of an unfamiliar car, which rapidly filled up as first Jasmin, Isaac and the tiny Hispanic girl arrived.
 Jasmin completely ignored me as she climbed into the car; Isaac gave me a polite, if somewhat cool nod.
 The Hispanic girl gave me an honest-to-goodness smile as she slipped behind the steering wheel and started the engine.
 In what was one of the most thoughtful things that'd happened all night, she turned the heater on full as she pulled out of the driveway.
 The drive into town, and then back out to my house was quiet, but luckily didn't take as long as normal.
 Apparently her timidness stopped well short of observing the speed limit.

Rick wasn't her husband.
 And he never would be.
 For that reason, she shouldn't make love with him .
 .
 .
 but for that reason, she wanted to make love with him.
 But how could she do that and then leave him forever?
 How could she give herself to him so completely and then walk away from him?
 With effort, she made herself roll off him, but she couldn't resist cuddling up against him.
 "I wish I could say yes.

She'd talk him into taking her to a speakeasy this weekend.
 Everything was back to normal.
 But that thought didn't erase the hollow spot in her heart.
 Today would be the first day in more than five weeks that she wouldn't see Rick.
 As much as she was looking forward to seeing Tom, that wasn't the same as knowing Rick would be home at 5:30, would kiss her and ask how her day had been, would hover around her as she made dinner.
 She just needed to get used to her life again, she told herself as she got dressed.
 She was where she belonged.

I did it, and I‚Äôm okay.
 As time went on Brandon was showing signs that he was faltering.
 I busted him again.
 Then, he began to collect speeding tickets, show up to work on the Chevelle apparently inebriated, fight with his brother, be non-participatory in the family.
 As I have freely admitted, I experimented with drugs in the seventies and the eighties and was no stranger to the signs of his drug use or the possibility of drug dealing.
 I knew all too well what could be ahead if he didn‚Äôt change his lifestyle.
 I had lost a couple of close friends to drug overdoses and a couple I knew were in prison.
 My own older brother had been sent to prison for drug dealing and although he had long been free from incarceration, he will never be free from his issues surrounding addiction.
 My biological father is an alcoholic, refusing to acknowledge his addiction and destroying any chance of being part of my youth or my children‚Äôs (his grandchildren‚Äôs) lives.
 Watching drugs tear apart my family and kill my friends had sent me in the opposite direction as an adult, as a husband and as a father.

It‚Äôs called ‚ÄòA Weekend in Nirvana‚Äô and is the artist‚Äôs idea of what Heaven might feel like.
 How odd.
 Art ‚Äì No, this is normal.
 Karen - How is it normal?

 Sorry, I thought you were talking about me again.
 What is odd about that painting?
 Karen ‚Äì Well, it seems like most people would paint what they think Heaven would look like, clouds and angels and harps and buildings that look like Greek Temples.
 People don‚Äôt usually touch on what it might feel like.

Do you think they would like pink coffins?‚Äù ‚ÄúTotally,‚Äù I laughed and grabbed my dry bag.
 ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go home.

 Then they clicked and she shoved it in her pocket.
 ‚ÄúYup I can.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always one step ahead.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlways.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo what do you think we should do?‚Äù Emily asked from my bed later on.

 Emily tapped her lip with her pencil and straightened her pink pajamas.
 ‚ÄúI have no clue what you just said Jazell.‚Äù I laughed, ‚ÄúWhat I meant was that we should ambush them.

What's going on?"
 She had a cell phone out, partially hidden by her desk.
 Part of me wondered why I'd never seen her with a phone before.
 Most girls walked around looking like they'd had some experimental surgery that created a two-way graft between their phone, their hand, and their ear.
 It didn't really matter though.
 Cell phone or not, the biggest part of me was already floating away to somewhere safe.
 "I'll call Alec; he'll know what to do."
 She was still whispering, but the words sheared through the darkness, arresting my fall.
 I didn't want him here, didn't want to give him another reason to despise me.

The veteran was clearly taking him seriously, going in slowly with his knees bent and his feet keeping active.
 Rodregas would have no skill advantage here.
 Rodregas was hesitant to bash his sword too much, as it was of average quality.
 While the sword should be fine for his first match, he hoped to be fighting all day today.
 He went forward leading with his round shield.
 He pushed his combatant back with some hard swings.
 Rodregas swung his shield aggressively, he hit the man‚Äôs sword with his shield and then banged the other man‚Äôs shield hard.
 Rodregas‚Äô goal was to see if he could out muscle the man while staying protected by the shield.
 It worked!
 Clearly his opponent, though set for a heavy blow, was not expecting the strength of Rodregas‚Äô bash.

They talked quietly until they dozed off and then awoke, talked, and fell asleep again.
 A weak light was filtering into the room when Rick opened his eyes again, his heart heavy.
 In just an hour or so, he'd lose Marie forever.
 Marie opened her eyes to find Rick gazing down at her.
 "Good morning."
 "Morning."
 "I love you."
 "I love you too."
 They were quiet for a few minutes.
 "Rick," Marie finally began, "maybe I should wait another day."

The spectators in this fight were divided into two groups, with a fairly significant space between them.
 The rest of the students seemed to be reluctant to fill that gap in.
 It wasn't until Britney pulled me closer that I understood why.
 Brandon stood surrounded by his friends on one side of the circle, with Alec and a smaller group standing opposite them.
 The tension in the room was like the air before a lightning strike, charged and unpredictable, a living organism on the point of materializing out of thin air and attacking anything surrounding it.
 Taking in the two groups, I was amazed at the disparity before my eyes.
 The kids behind Brandon were half again as many as the gathering behind Alec, and they were eager for the confrontation, watching with excited eyes, and large smiles.
 Alec's company on the other hand awaited the coming fight with calm exteriors and a sense they were bowing before the inevitable conflict without conceding anything to their opponents.
 They were fewer in number, but the men were larger than anyone other than Alec or Brandon, and I somehow knew even the girls were dangerous.
 With a sudden start I realized the confrontation wasn't between Brandon and Alec as I'd originally thought.

Inadequate skills are a major impediment to the assimilation of new technologies.
 The increasing demands of global competitiveness place pressure on workers in these countries to continuously improve their skills.
 The mismatch between the skills of the workforce and the evolving needs of industry aggravates unemployment.
 Studies of the return on investment from training programmes document the enormous benefits of continuously upgrading the skills of the workforce.
 Private sector investment in training will prove in adequate unless it is encouraged by incentives or complemented by greater public investment in this sector.

The fact I was saying these things to Alec when I knew this all had to be a dream was ludicrous, but it wasn't as ludicrous as the way he flinched at my words.
 "No, you're right, all too soon you'll go the way of so many others.
 If I can depend on nothing else, I can rely on that."
 A little eddy of wind found its way into our grotto, and for the first time my newly-acute sense of smell registered Alec's presence.
 His scent was divine, full of subtle themes I wasn't experienced enough to pick out, all of which screamed of warm power and rock-like masculinity.
 For half a second the torrent of sensation was too strong to leave room for conscious thought.
 I realized I'd closed my eyes to better savor the experience.
 When I opened them Alec's expression had moved from annoyance to sadness.
 I had a pair of heartbeats to wonder at the strange tricks my subconscious was playing on me, and then the dream started fading away.
 The heavenly surroundings were predictably the first thing to disappear, leaving afterimages of light burned into the corners of my vision.

‚ÄúAfter you have the cash and they have the pills, tell ‚Äòem you‚Äôre going to head to Tahoe.
 That will be our signal.‚Äù I could handle that.
 When I was given the shots fired and weapon instructions, I realized that desperate druggies rob guys like me.
 The officer began to explain what I was to do if this turned out to be a robbery.
 Apparently, this Steve was known to carry a weapon and he was known to come up a little short on cash for drug deals and if the seller wasn‚Äôt willing to accept the lower amount, he might brandish his weapon.
 If he pulled the gun or a weapon of any sort, the officers needed me to indicate that.
 ‚ÄúHow about ‚Äògun, gun, he‚Äôs got a fucking gun‚Äô‚Äù?
 I asked.
 ‚ÄúHow about, ‚Äò there‚Äôs no need for guns,‚Äô‚Äù the officer countered.
 This was an unexpected instruction and a situation I hadn‚Äôt realistically contemplated.

Then again, he hadn't released my shoulders yet, so maybe there was still some hope.
 "I'm not sure that's the best idea.
 You really need your sleep.
 The whole purpose of this little exercise is to convince your mom you've been safely home this entire time.
 If you crash later in the day, she's going to know you didn't sleep tonight."
 "Maybe if you stayed with me it would help me sleep."
 I almost couldn't believe those words were really coming out of my mouth.
 I wanted to blame it on how close he was standing, or how tired I was, or anything else that might be remotely believable, but based on how serious his face had just become, it was too late to take it all back.
 "That doesn't strike me as being a much better solution."
 I felt my neck and face begin to burn from embarrassment.

As the three men started to head down the road Doi‚Äôvan walked up to Rodregas and stated, ‚ÄúI would rather travel with you.‚Äù That was it; he just stood there like some huge tree after that simple statement.
 Audrian seemed as surprised as he was.
 They both spoke at the same time, their thoughts strangely in agreement.
 ‚ÄúAre you crazy?‚Äù asked Audrian at the same time as Rodregas said, ‚ÄúThat is crazy.‚Äù ‚ÄúLook, the Guild will be after me,‚Äù Rodregas stated.
 ‚ÄúIt will not be safe to travel in my company,‚Äù he added.
 ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù stated the Hellborn in a voice that was so deep it was like stones grinding.
 ‚ÄúBut still, I would travel with you.‚Äù Again he made the statement and showed no interest in explaining his action.
 ‚ÄúActually,‚Äù added Imeralda shaking her long curly hair behind her as if to clear the way for her decision, ‚ÄúI was thinking the same thing.
 I am not safe from the Guild anyhow.
 My natural magical talent is very strong, and until I am better skilled in it, I am very vulnerable,‚Äù she stated ‚ÄúAnd frankly, while Audrian, Brit and Geor are very brave to let me travel with them, I fear that I put their lives in danger.

No, no--just a joke, son."
 He returned the box to Davis.
 "My permission is a foregone conclusion.

 "My plans certainly can't be a secret to you--or to anyone else, for that matter.

He purred something toward Ruby about her decorations and gave me a wink as he walked off in the direction Chevelle had gone.
 We were alone then, Ruby and I, and I was sure this was going to hurt more than my other training.
 She untied her cloak and tossed it to land with a muffled sound on the rocks.
 She was smiling a touch as she reached a hand across her waist, closing her fist around a black hoop I‚Äôd not seen before.
 She drew it out and around as a long black trail curved in its wake and came to rest at her side.
 My mouth went dry.
 A whip.
 Oh yes, this would hurt.
 I loosed my cloak and pitched it aside, lowering myself in a defensive stance, hands out and ready.
 Crack!

And buy the video when it comes out."
 He was thrilled when she didn't say she'd probably be back in 1927 before then.
 She was quiet during the ride home, remembering the scene she'd done.
 And how she'd peered through a camera.
 And sat in a director's chair as he walked his sitcom actors through a scene.
 It hadn't been a page out of a fairy tale like she'd expected, but it had been exciting nevertheless.
 And a dream-come-true.
 "I feel gritty.
 I think I'm going to jump in the shower," Rick told her when they got back to the hotel.

Feeling like a traitor, I headed my skittering thoughts off before they could start affecting me physically, and focused on the next step in getting ready.
 There was a lot more at stake this morning than last night.
 If I fell apart now I might not make it to school, and then I'd have all kinds of trouble calming Mom back down when she returned from wherever she'd gone.
 My hair hung as limp and straight as always.
 No amount of styling ever made it look any better, just more contrived.
 Makeup was the same way.
 A touch here or there made me look marginally better, but I sincerely envied the girls who were skilled enough to transform their faces into something breathtaking after a session in the bathroom.
 Mom wasn't any help.
 Most days she didn't even put on mascara.
 With the most depressing part of my routine now done, my mind wandered forward.

I was so angry at Brandon at one point that I stood with a hammer over the Chevelle and considered destroying it.
 The Chevelle sitting unfinished in the garage had become a grim symbol of the disappointment I felt with my son.
 Instead, I arranged to have it towed to a friend‚Äôs shop with the agreement that Brandon and I would show up together twice a week and work towards finishing the project with the assistance of a professional (and the expectations of someone other than Dad).
 It didn‚Äôt work to bring Brandon back.
 I warned and warned, but no matter how much I warned him, he continued his journey to the dark side.
 He was over six feet tall and weighed less than 140 pounds.
 He was sickly, late to every family event and completely high when and if he showed up.
 He was a constant embarrassment at large family gatherings as he was the last to show and the first to go.
 When our Chevelle was ready for its maiden voyage, he was a no show.
 I delayed starting the car for hours, expecting he might be late, but he never showed.

 While the sun was still a sliver peeking over the horizon, Aurelia shook Harruq‚Äôs shoulders to wake him.
 She then sat back and put her hands to her forehead while the half-orc tried to remember where he was.
 ‚ÄúCan you find him?‚Äù Harruq asked her, realizing what she was doing.
 He sat on his rear and began readjusting his armor to his more slender frame.
 ‚ÄúIn time,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúI have met him only once, but I doubt there are any like him.
 Stay quiet and be patient.‚Äù
 Her mind was a net, and she cast it further and further out, scanning the rolling hills and the plains beyond.

Maybe twice, at least, Eric chose to die for me.
 Still, because Eric didn‚Äôt create himself, to worship him would be like praising Hamlet rather than Shakespeare.
 Besides, if Eric died for me, it probably wasn‚Äôt the human in him, but the Christ.
 So I will take care not to worship Eric, only adore him.
 I wonder if I have been stricken by acute anthropomorphism.
 Maybe I should give up watching my Joan of Arcadia CD collection.

At least he would be if Alec had remembered to work whatever magic he'd used on the Mayor the first time.
 Of course it was possible he'd forgotten to make the arrangements, but somehow I doubted it.
 Mom looked like she was starting to waver.
 "It does seem like a great opportunity, but there just isn't any good way to know for sure it's legitimate."
 That didn't sound like Alec at all.
 "Are you sure, Mom?
 They didn't arrange anything you could use to verify they're for real?"
 I suddenly realized why parents got such a big kick out of catching their kids doing something wrong.
 Mom looked so sheepish I almost laughed.
 "Well, he did say he'd arrange for an immediate advance to be wired over to our bank, but it's closed on Saturdays, and it isn't like I can go calling up the bank president for something trivial like that."

"All right.
 You can come.
 I don't like it.
 Don't like knowing you're guaranteed not to survive my passing, but it's your choice."
 I was too busy being amazed by how quickly he'd stopped shaking, how rapidly his eyes had gone back to normal to really wonder whether or not it was all just an elaborate ruse designed to lull me into a false sense of security so he could trap me here.
 "Not that I'm complaining, mind you, but why the sudden change?"
 Alec gave me a lopsided smile of his own.
 "My death is nearly certain, but there's always a chance I'll somehow survive.
 As unlikely as that is, I don't want to survive and then find I've poisoned you against me.
 I won't stop you."

I wondered if all the highs, mind trips, love affairs and communions he had written about were cover-ups for his soul's desperation.
 I had found the real world to be at least as tragic, seamy, unjust and dangerous as Billy Graham preached.
 Thinking of Billy Graham reminded me that the light I had noticed from the shore of the Tia Juana river was growing dim.
 At home, I would've gotten drafted except I returned to school.
 Congress had extended the Social Security benefit for those of us with dead fathers.
 I would get paid to go to college until age twenty-two, which delighted my mom, to whom education was everything.
 San Diego State University was surrounded by faith centers.
 Mormon, Catholic, Lutheran, and Jewish.
 Down the road a few blocks was a large Baptist church.
 Since my profession of faith, my only steps in God's direction were reading through the Bible, praying now and then, and getting baffled by J.D.

 "I know you just broke up with Davis two days ago, but a family dinner--" "It has nothing to do with Davis.

 The thought of being courted was revolting.
 Rick had said that they'd both eventually settle for someone else and get married, but she had no intention of marrying anyone else.
 She would never stop loving Rick.
 After breakfast Marie felt restless and agreed to her mother's suggestion that they go shopping.
 But they'd no sooner begun browsing through the first shop than she began feeling panicky.

His heart froze though at her quiet whisper.
 ‚ÄúYou share a minor sigil very freely for being in the great Cathedral itself,‚Äù her voice was but a whisper, her eyes more curious then challenging.
 ‚ÄúThey would likely die without our aid,‚Äù said Imeralda.
 Doi‚Äôvan nodded next to her.
 Rodregas thought that Doi‚Äôvan was strangely silent.
 He guessed that the Hellborn was afraid to speak, even in a whisper.
 His voice was like granite breaking and traveled.
 ‚ÄúSo you risk your life to save strangers?‚Äù the female squire asked.
 Her voice actually sounded curious.
 Rodregas said, ‚ÄúYes, we do.

I was aware of their eyes on me before they uncomfortably turned away again.
 Chevelle approached me warily as I lay curled in a ball on my blankets, the book positioned in front of me.
 He tossed it aside but I no longer cared.
 He sat behind me and pulled me into his arms, holding me as I wept.
 It was more right than anything had been in a long, long time.
 I woke with new resolve.
 I stood, prepared to make things right, but something was‚Ä¶ off.
 The group surrounded me, tense.
 I glanced around but couldn‚Äôt see why.
 And then, from nowhere, I was thrown into the air.

Then they started to pick up speed and I covered my face with my hands.
 The rain streaked through my hair, soaking it to my head.
 Seth looked extremely annoyed as he stood there, his blue hair plastered to his face.
 His eyes were half covered by his hair and his eyes locked onto mine.
 He rolled his eyes and looked away.
 Jason had his arms over his head, trying to keep the rain off his red hair but I already saw dark spots all over it where the rain had escaped his arms.
 Emily's pink hair was dry and safely under a hood.
 Wait, what?
 ‚ÄúEmily, how come you have a hood?‚Äù I had to shout over the rain.
 She gave me a dazzling smile.

Seth shouted, ‚ÄúStay together, don‚Äôt get separated!‚Äù A troll charged at me and I jumped to the side.
 I looked up and saw that Emily, Jason, and Seth had been swallowed by the rushing creatures.
 So much for that plan.
 ‚ÄúEmily!‚Äù I yelled but my voice was drowned out.
 I saw a flash of fire off to the side.
 Emily was fine.
 I twisted around so that the troll charged past me.
 I turned and plunged my knife into its back before it could respond and it fell to the ground.
 I felt pain flare in my right foot and looked down to see a frost beast with its teeth in my leg.
 When I tried to pull away, in bit down harder.

‚ÄúThere is no way that I'm going to say that.‚Äù ‚ÄúJazell, can you see its weakness?‚Äù Seth called to me.
 I squinted at the creature, and saw a dark circle under its belly.
 ‚ÄúIt's under its belly, but you have to get by the stinger first.
 That might cause us a problem.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo problem,‚Äù Seth replied and swung his sword in an ark.

"You're beautiful, Marie."
 She caught her breath, unable to respond.
 To her delight, she saw that he was going to kiss her.
 She closed her eyes, savoring the anticipation and then the sweetness of his lips on hers.
 When, after a few seconds, he didn't end the kiss, her heartbeat sped up.
 He'd never kissed her this long before.
 But her eyes flew open when she felt his hand slide under her skirt to squeeze her thigh.
 Panicking, she tried to push him away.
 But he pinned her against the back of the sofa, his mouth becoming rough.
 She tried to break away from him because he was kissing her so hard that her teeth were cutting into her lips; she could taste the blood.

Another hour, and still no shadow.
 Harruq stepped back inside and plopped down.
 The other half-orc remained at the door, his eyes not leaving the gray outside.
 ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not sending for us,‚Äù Harruq said.
 ‚ÄúYou are correct,‚Äù said Velixar‚Äôs voice, startling both of them.
 They turned to see their master emerge from the shadows of their home, his red eyes gleaming.
 ‚ÄúHow did you get in here?‚Äù the warrior asked.

‚ÄúYou know there is a reason that the Immortalist Sorcerers rule this land.
 I have a few questions for you though before I leave your dried up husks behind for the rats.‚Äù Rodregas growled to himself and pulled the only weapon he had, a small dagger, out and threw it hard straight at Van‚Äôdret.
 A second dagger flew almost in the same heart beat from Doi‚Äôvan.
 The sorcerer simply waved in the air and both daggers flew to the side and clattered off the wall.
 The sorcerer smiled, standing tall, and Rodregas had to admit he seemed very relaxed and in control.
 His expensive black and gold robes were perfectly cut, his dark hair was slicked back.
 He might be wearing the body of a twenty year old, but he showed all the self confidence of a man who counted his age in decades if not centuries.
 Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs voice reflected the articulation and grace of a man who had all the time in the world to enjoy the finer things in life.
 ‚ÄúSo let us dispense with the silly games and lies.
 Let me be clear about something.

I must‚Äôve looked pagan or drug addled.
 Usually they ran in twos.
 While one of them smiled, the other would ask, ‚ÄúHave you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?‚Äù ‚ÄúYep,‚Äù I would say, and either stay and observe their perplexed surprise, or excuse myself before they could ask, ‚ÄúWhat church do you attend?‚Äù and then pitch theirs to me when I said I don‚Äôt, which was usually the case.
 The only effective evangelist I encountered in those days was Tony Tarantino, a lanky Jesus freak with frizzy red hair and an expression both bewildered and wise.
 I picked him up hitchhiking.
 He settled into the seat, set his Bible on his lap, stared at me for a minute and asked, ‚ÄúHave you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?‚Äù ‚ÄúYep,‚Äù I said, and readied myself to field the standard subsequent questions.
 Tony said, ‚ÄúOh.
 Good.‚Äù A week later, he was leading a Bible study at our house.

 I believe nobody heard his stories from Vietnam until years afterward.

She wished that she could let them know that she was all right.
 And that someone was taking care of her.
 She'd only known Rick a week, but she already trusted him.
 More than she trusted Davis.
 Rick had kept his promise and come home at 5:30 every day, and he'd apologized for trying to kiss her.
 The last time she'd seen Davis, he'd kissed her so hard that her teeth had cut her lips.
 And he certainly hadn't apologized.
 She touched the ring that Davis had put on her left hand, twisting it.
 Could she spend her entire life with a man like that?

If we had inscribed this sigil back at the farm we would never have needed your help.‚Äù Jordaan nodded at the truth of Rodregas‚Äô words and the two of them quickly gathered the others.
 All agreed that no matter what might happen with the greater sigils that all should gain the minor Sigil of Healing.
 Its benefits to warriors and mages alike were well known.
 Jordaan agreed to do the inscribing and show the others the technique.
 In return Imeralda would inscribe Jordaan who was also eager for the sigil.
 Jordaan had his hand out with the palm facing up.
 At Jordaan‚Äôs direction Rodregas put his own, palm up, on top of it.
 The frog went on top and Jordaan‚Äôs other hand went on top of the frog.
 Jordaan then said, ‚ÄúThis is going to hurt, it will feel like someone is drawing a pattern under your skin with a knife.
 If you pull away before it is done, you will mess up the pattern and it will use up your magic without adding the benefits of the sigil.‚Äù As Jordaan finished speaking he looked in Rodregas‚Äô eyes until he nodded his understanding.

And for the first time ever, I thought, my God, Eric died for me.
 I believe our minds go far deeper than the part that allows us to reason.
 When we encounter an idea and it seems to brighten our consciousness and lead to a wealth of new insights, we should trust it at least as much as we trust a reasoned argument.
 Because if we look close enough at almost any reasoned argument, we can find a flaw or logical fallacy.
 My first year in college, I majored in philosophy.
 The second class opened with ancient Greeks.
 The professor set these philosophers‚Äô arguments against each other.
 Next she used Roman arguments to refute the Greek who prevailed over the earlier Greeks.
 Then she applied the arguments of medieval scholastics to refute the Romans, and some arguments of Renaissance philosophers to refute the scholastics, and so on.
 At semester's end, she returned to the first Greek and, with his arguments, refuted a modern German.

It is unnatural.
 Now, it is my turn to ask a question.‚Äù ‚ÄúActually,‚Äù interrupted Rodregas, ‚Äúyou already asked me about being an old soldier.
 Let me answer that first.
 I was a sergeant in Ravenhurr‚Äôs guard and I am afraid I have become what I learned to hate more than anything, an Immortalist.‚Äù Rodregas paused and took a deep breath.
 What he said next was hard even for himself to say, ‚ÄúIn truth, I am an old man who had his time on this world and did not do much with it.
 But now I have stolen the body of a very promising young man.
 I will die feeling guilty for what I have done, but I plan to take a few of you with me.
 Now, it is my turn for a question,‚Äù he said.
 Rodregas hoped that Imeralda would do whatever she was going to do soon; the conversation was escalating and he did not think they had much time before things got deadly.
 Rodregas asked, ‚ÄúWhy did the Immortalist Taiga capture my friend Doi‚Äôvan and keep him in his Menagerie of Earth, Sky and Fire for two years before selling him to Ravenhurr?

I couldn't not want him, not love him, any more than he could do less than his best to keep his family from harm.
 Chapter 28 Alec was completely drenched in sweat, and I still wanted to throw myself at him so badly my teeth hurt.
 It shouldn't be possible for someone to look so good dressed in what amounted to little more than loose, extra-stretchy sweatpants.
 "How was training?"
 It was hard to sound casual.
 The urge to kiss him had become almost overpowering in the last few days.
 He knew me better on every level imaginable than anyone outside my immediate family ever had, and all I could think about right now was how much I wanted to touch him.
 "Fairly well, all things considered.
 We took it easy though..." I'd gotten used to the idea that he left a substantial number of thoughts unsaid out of a desire to protect me from knowing too much.
 I didn't like it, but I'd learned to accept it.

Albert, Mrs. Campbell, and the other tutor all waved goodbye as they left.
 One of the cheerleaders, a particularly whiny specimen named Jackie, wanted help, which I was happy to offer, even in my current state.
 Unfortunately she thought that meant I'd just hand over all the answers.
 We spent a good ten minutes with her trying to offer a variety of covert bribes ranging from the insignificant to things she couldn't possibly deliver.
 I kept telling her I wasn't interested and that she'd just have to do the work.
 Surprisingly enough, once she accepted that, she actually buckled down.
 It only took another ten minutes to explain the Pythagorean theory to her.
 By the time I stood up from Jackie's desk, there were only four of us left.
 Britney was staring sullenly at her book.
 I thought about going over and seeing if she needed any help, but after helping Jackie I was feeling pretty good.

 One after another the deft strokes came in, and one after another Antonil batted them away using the methodical style that had helped him rise to his place at the top of the Neldaren army.
 His opponent, a young elf whose swordplay was raw compared to most of his brethren, tried to give him no reprieve.
 The guard captain didn‚Äôt falter in the slightest.
 ‚ÄúYou sacrifice planning and thought for sheer speed and reflexes,‚Äù he said, his breathing steady and practiced.
 He assumed the elf spoke the human tongue, and the sudden killing lunge proved him correct.
 Antonil pulled his head back, the point stopping just shy of drawing blood.

It didn‚Äôt move.
 I could see the monster clearly now that I had stepped into its world.
 It was hunched over, occasionally touching the ground with one of its curled front paws.
 Dark saliva dripped out of its mouth.
 The beady black eyes made it no less scary.
 I knew exactly what it is.
 A thrasher!
 A shiver ran down my spine.
 Thrashers were probably one of the most feral and nasty monsters I‚Äôve ever encountered.
 They sometimes travel alone or hunt in packs.

 I opened my mouth, but just simply didn't know what to say.
 The horror of being trapped in a body that was riddled with old injuries was something thousands of people faced every day, but it seemed even more of a shame for someone who'd once been so vital and strong.

"Yeah.

 He took her hand and led her back to the house.
 Her fear had returned.
 Not fear of being stuck in 2011 but of spending the day without Rick.
 What would she do?
 She showered while Rick did the same in his bathroom, and she washed her hair with some shampoo she found on the edge of the tub.
 It smelled nice, and she found herself wishing for some perfume or some bath oil.
 She should have thought of that yesterday.
 After toweling her hair dry, she combed it, bound her chest, and put on the blue-green blouse and her jeans.

That would make a nice change of pace.‚Äù Imeralda continued, ‚ÄúHe along with the two best of the slavers‚Äô horses that I claimed.
 That means we now have three decent riding horses.
 Not the Dire war mounts that I know you want, but an upgrade on what we had.
 The local armorer was also able to piece together some steel chain that was decent quality and a good leather harness for Doi‚Äôvan and he was able to repair your armor.
 You now also have some chain that should fit over your leather armor.‚Äù Imeralda added, ‚ÄúI was able to recover only about a score of the arrows, but I have been working with some of the wood nymphs and the armorer and we now have a full set of arrows again.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan, at her motion towards his armor, picked up the pile of chain mail and tried it over his head.
 The opening on top actually fit over his huge head.
 Doi‚Äôvan guessed that it had been the chain of the large overweight slaver that he had killed.
 While the equipment was all of average quality, Rodregas was smiling because clearly there were three sets of everything plus a pack horse for equipment.
 Imeralda was clearly planning on joining them.
 While that is what his heart hoped for he was not sure if it was the smartest move.

_As the vision faded, one last sight burned into Qurrah‚Äôs mind: it was he, dressed in deep robes of black, his eyes glowing a bloody crimson._
 ‚ÄúThat was Veldaren,‚Äù Qurrah said as Velixar‚Äôs fingers pulled back.
 He felt awe and fear at the sight of the magnificent city ablaze.
 ‚ÄúI want all of Neldar to burn,‚Äù Velixar said, his deep voice rumbling.
 ‚ÄúWill you aid me?‚Äù
 Such a great request, a desire for destruction that most would hesitate before.
 For Qurrah, though, it was a fate he had long expected.
 It was within his blood, the cursed, the race of the ugly and the destructive.
 Yet it had been his elvish blood that had him banished.
 Such foolishness.

He went to the door and listened; it seemed to be getting quieter.
 It was the middle of the night and the stir from the ceremony seemed to have subsided, but it was only hours until dawn when everyone would be heading out to celebrate the new ‚Äòbirth‚Äô of Ravenhurr.
 Not a true celebration for most; as their lord and master, ‚Äòhe‚Äô was more feared than loved.
 Rodregas locked the door to prevent a surprise.
 He should have done that before; it was sloppy of him not to take such a simple precaution.
 Asking Captain Poir to send up Adapt Korin had been totally unplanned.
 He had been dreaming of killing Korin for all the 18 years that he had served in the tower.
 The Sorcerer Ravenhurr had been an immoral monster that used those around him for his own selfish desires.
 But Adapt Korin was of a more casual evil; he never passed up the opportunity to hurt those around him, physically or emotionally.
 Ravenhurr had existed in the same body for the full eighteen years of Rodregas‚Äô service, and was hundreds of years old.

Their deaths were an unavoidable price to save an innocent."
 Some of the faces across the circle from me flinched a little, and I had a moment to wonder if Brandon hadn't told them the truth about what'd happened.
 "Her life belonged to me, it was mine to dispose of as I saw fit."
 I opened my mouth to protest, but closed it at a sharp jab in the ribs from Rachel.
 "The ancient laws don't support her life being a disposable commodity, extinguished at your whim.
 Not even the bond of Ja'tell provides you with that right."
 Brandon's grin was wider even than before.
 "Ah, but those aren't the laws under which we labor now, are they?
 She's mine, and I have every right to do whatever I wish to her.
 Her presence among your pack is a direct affront to my rights and honor.

Depending on their sigils, they were likely to be either faster or stronger or both.
 But Rodregas‚Äô short swords would not cut their armor.
 It put them at an extreme disadvantage.
 As the arrows flew over his head, he became aware of the other disadvantage of bows.
 They were dealing with a limited supply of arrows; once the arrows where all shot, they lost their main advantage.
 Rodregas heard the noise of the first soldier to rush from the road; he went low and swung hard.
 Rodregas hit knee high and the man trying to run by went flying head first into the dirt.
 Rodregas knew from the feel of the blow that his sword had hit armor and bounced off.
 It was an Immortal Guard.
 Doi‚Äôvan shot another arrow almost straight down into the back of the neck of the downed guard.

Eric told him not to, I would learn the next day.
 Eric, whom no one recalled having done a single mean act, or said a single mean word, had told Kenny to leave us behind.
 When Kenny asked him to explain, he only insisted he didn‚Äôt want Billy or me along.
 He wouldn‚Äôt say why.
 That night on Viejas grade, Mike was driving when they swerved off the road and careened down an embankment.
 On account of some miracle or quirk of physics, the little car didn‚Äôt roll, only slammed down on a wide ledge in the mountainside.
 Eric was riding shotgun, where I might've been, since I was taller and longer-legged than any of the others except Mike Beatty, who was driving.
 In those days nobody wore seatbelts.
 Though Kenny would later swear he found the shotgun door closed, and the window closed and unbroken, Eric flew out.
 The door must have opened then slammed shut after him.

The new prescription combined with what I already had would meet the quantity of one hundred Oxys that they wanted.
 I also wanted a solid clarification that I was only going to meet on my terms, just as I had in my fictitious deal.
 Did I mention I am in sales?
 Telling her I sold the drugs to someone else is the classic ‚Äútake-away‚Äù which creates an urgency and desire to comply.
 She said they would buy the Oxys and they would meet me where I wanted.
 She assured me that there would be no bullshit this time.
 I told her I would call her and give her the meeting place after I filled the prescription.
 I called the lead narcotics officer and informed him of my conversation.
 Again he was amazed at my creativity with the concoction of the take away story.
 I told him why I did it that way and that I only wanted to wear a wire one more time.

Whatever she was about to say was preempted as we were both thrown forward in our seats.
 James slid the car through a one-eighty turn that left us facing the direction we'd just come from, only a couple of feet from the start of our lane.
 "You're not making her walk!"
 It was obvious that whatever magical ability had allowed Rachel to face down the larger boy wasn't working anymore.
 He looked like he was set for a monster fight.
 "I'm not washing my car again."
 I expected Rachel to back down as soon as she realized he was spoiling for a fight, but if anything she looked more determined.
 It was hard to believe this was the same person I'd had to rescue from Cassie so recently.
 I stopped Rachel just before she could put the impressive lungful of air she'd just taken in to whatever use she'd planned.

 I guess they‚Äôve never seen a teenage half-ling girl fall out of a bush before.
 ‚ÄúAm I interrupting something?‚Äù Emily asked with a gulp.
 The faery men drew their double swords and charged at her.
 I released an arrow and it buried itself in one of their necks.
 It fell backward and they turned to my hiding spot, searching for me.
 Two knives flew and a dwarf and man collapsed on the ground.
 I saw Jason hide behind his tree again.

They were staying in a small village that seemed to be mostly a forest with small rooms built into it.
 Rodregas could not figure out any set pattern to the place or its boundaries.
 There might have been a dozen or even hundreds of Nymphs living there.
 Though all the Nymphs were friendly, he was still eager to leave.
 Jordaan was doing one of his mystic checks, running his hand a foot above Rodregas‚Äô reclining body.
 Occasionally, his hand seemed to be moving in the air like a baker making bread.
 ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Rodregas finally said, ‚ÄúI feel fine now and I thank you for your healing, but I think I am ready to leave.‚Äù Jordaan nodded.
 His face held his usual expression of good cheer.
 ‚ÄúYour body heals fast and is a fascinating medium to work with.‚Äù A cloud went over his smile when he added, ‚ÄúYour body and spirit were not in very good alignment and your connection to the world was terribly fractured.
 Truly, it has been more effort to fix your spiritual wounds than your physical ones.‚Äù Jordaan‚Äôs smile returned when he added, ‚ÄúWhile true healing takes a lifetime of both inner and outer work, you are physically healthy enough to be on your way.

My hair and clothing were drenched in sweat and I was near surrender.
 And then, with no more warning than when the first pains came, it was over.
 A small, sweet child was in my arms.
 I drew in ragged breaths as I cleaned her face.
 I wiped her eyes and they came open, an unbelievable shade of dark green, sparkling like emeralds.
 She was a beauty.
 I wasn‚Äôt aware the room had grown silent until I wiped her ears and heard my own gasp.
 They were slightly rounded at the tips‚Ä¶ almost blunt.
 I realized I had stopped breathing as I read, so engrossed in the story.
 I reached up absentmindedly to stroke the tops of my ears.

He went to the kitchen and set the pizza on the table.
 As he was filling glasses with ice, she padded into the kitchen.
 "Hi.
 I thought you'd be later."
 It was only 6:30.
 "So did I.
 But I hurried--I couldn't wait to get home."
 He smiled at her.
 "We need to add a bathrobe to our shopping list, don't we?"
 She was wearing his, obviously having just showered.

I felt a momentary spasm in the pit of my stomach at the thought of her choking.
 And then I remembered growing the weeds in the garden and I was suddenly in a rush to get to Junnie‚Äôs.
 I rapped our special knock, and in a heartbeat, Junnie was opening the door.
 ‚ÄúMorning, Freylina.
 Early start today?‚Äù My voice was determined.
 ‚ÄúYes, I want to practice growing.‚Äù She glanced at the pendant against my chest.
 She was silent for a moment as she looked into my eyes, almost searching.
 She was probably worried I was sad or missing my mother.
 ‚ÄúNot today.
 It seems I have business with the Council this morning.‚Äù Her mouth turned down in a grimace.

_No,_ he thought.
 _Enough.
 Cease your chatter._
 He clutched tighter, the threads braiding into a giant rope in his mind.
 High above, the skulls quieted, and their fires dimmed.
 When the necromancer noticed Qurrah‚Äôs meddling, his mental link pulsed with incredible energy.
 Colors swarmed through his mind, dark purples and reds across a macabre canvas of black.
 He felt his chest tightening, his neck constricting.
 A scrying eye was upon him, now, and he was losing.
 It felt like an arrow pierced his mind, and through it words seeped into his head.

It is knighthood.
 Now, the discussion is over.‚Äù growled Marshal Faurrenida.
 To forestall any further argument, the Grand Marshal stepped forward quickly and drew his sword.
 The sword gleamed of the highest quality blue steel and red fire seemed to run its length.
 Marshal Faurrenida laid the sword on Rodregas‚Äô right shoulder and said, ‚ÄúSquire, you come to us this day.
 Think well and be sure on your decision to swear these oaths.‚Äù Faurrenida paused for a second and then slowly added.
 ‚ÄúWill you swear to uphold the Rules of Chivalry, to serve the Order of the Soaring Heavens with honor, and to serve as the Champion of the Celestials on this World if called to be a Paladin?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy Lord Grand Marshal, I so swear in the name of the Celestial Gods.‚Äù Strangely, instead of being excited, he felt tired.
 In some ways he was adding another burden and it was heavy.
 ‚ÄúArise, Sir Rodregas, Knight of the Soaring Heavens and be made welcome in the Cathedral of the Heavens.‚Äù Applause filled the room, though it was muted.
 Rodregas looked for Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda and he was sad to see that they had not been there to share his moment.

Chapter Fourteen Traveling
 The group was waiting for us when we crossed over the ridge, down to the site where we had spent so many days and nights.
 If I hadn‚Äôt been so exhausted from lack of sleep, I would have probably been nervous.
 As it was, I blindly followed Ruby as we gathered and eventually mounted to leave.
 Chevelle, Steed, and I were back on our mounts from the earlier leg of the journey.
 Ruby, Grey, and Anvil each rode their own black horses, though Anvil‚Äôs was larger‚ÄîI assumed to accommodate his massive frame‚Äîand Ruby‚Äôs was decorated, tendrils of red and gold in his mane.
 Though it wasn‚Äôt unusual, I didn‚Äôt see Rhys and Rider or the wolves.
 I wondered if they had their own horses and preferred to stay out of sight or if they ran with the wolves.
 I felt slightly comforted either way.
 Once we were on our way, I didn‚Äôt mind so much.

He threw the armor on the bed.
 It might not work for him to wear, but he could get a good amount of money selling such fancy armor.
 It was the first item of real worth that he had found.
 On a shelf above it was another small pile of the silver chain.
 When he pulled it up he saw that it was a helmet, a solid Mithril skullcap with sides of chain mail designed to be connected at the bottom.
 He reached up and pulled it on his head, but even his head was too large for the AElfin style Mithril armor.
 It quickly joined the suit of armor and the candleholder on the bed.
 On the bottom shelf he found a nice pair of boots, not of AElven make.
 Attached were matching grieves, armor designed to protect the lower leg., and a pair of armored gauntlets to compete the set.
 All ended up on the bed.

The sides of the building were a deep brown, like the trunk of an ancient tree.
 The roof jutted out far past the walls.
 It was the color of wet leaves.
 Many windows decorated the front, all covered with silken curtains.
 The fence surrounded the entire property, black iron spiked ten feet at the top.
 ‚ÄúHow do we get in?‚Äù Harruq asked.
 Qurrah examined the fence, his face locked in a frown.
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.
 I have no spells that can aid us.‚Äù

 Chapter 1 Stepping back out into the relentless desert sun, I once again wished we were still back in Minnesota, or at least that we were done moving.
 Then again I might as well have been wishing that Mom had decided on somewhere other than Utah, or that we'd had some long-lost relative die and leave us a small fortune, or even better that Dad and Cindi...
 The thought was much too dangerous to complete.
 My breathing had already sped up, and my balance degenerated so quickly it was a small miracle I made it over to the U-Haul before I keeled over.
 I'd hated the battered vehicle that had spent the last two days carrying us west across I-80.
 It was hard to keep up the feeling though when it was the only thing protecting me from a concussion.
 Half of the horizon was green and beautiful, not land-of-ten-thousand-lakes beautiful, but still not bad.
 I, of course, ended up on the wrong side of the truck; barren dirt and rocks, only occasionally relieved by scrubby plant life, as far as the eye could see.
 I still didn't buy into my mom's oft-repeated claim.

 It turned her words into my nightmares.

 Chevelle.

 ‚ÄúFrey.‚Äù Ruby woke me at dawn, urging me to stand for a few moments before we were back on the horses.
 I was exhausted again, so I hung back from the group as we rode.
 Steed slowed to ride with me as I watched Ruby and Grey banter ahead.
 ‚ÄúSteed, why aren‚Äôt they together?‚Äù He sighed; I didn‚Äôt think he enjoyed discussing his sister‚Äôs personal life.

They never seem to rest, much to my annoyance.
 I sighed and rolled over, burying my face in my pillow.
 I managed to think about something other than creatures that go bump in the night as I drifted off to sleep.
 In the morning I changed and ran down stairs and left a note saying I was going out to eat with Jason, Emily and Seth.
 It took me minutes to speed down to the small breakfast restaurant in town.
 I chained up my bike and walked over to the plastic blue table my friends had occupied.
 I slid in next to Emily, who was talking about some book she had read recently.
 Jason, who sat next to her, was pretending to be fascinated by her rant.
 Emily stopped in mid-sentence when she noticed me sitting beside her.

Too much reliance has been placed on the capacity of the teacher to teach, too little on the inherent natural capacity of human beings for self-motivated learning and self-discovery.
 It may be fair to say that the state of our educational systems throughout the world is an accurate reflection of the state of human development in different societies.
 In this context, the UN Millennium Goals of achieving universal primary education and eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary education represent the bare minimum commitment that every society must make to enhance the capacities of its youth.
 The great Tamil poet, Subramanya Bharati, rightly emphasized that nutrition and education are the two legs of a human being.
 Pre-school education should receive as much attention as post-graduate education.
 At the other end of the development spectrum, no society has yet developed the knowledge and expertise to impart the best of what it has acquired to a broad cross-section of its citizens.
 Few have been able to ignite the aspiration for continuous learning and the capacity for original creativity that are the most profound characteristics of human consciousness.
 Measured in these terms, even the most developed nations still have a long way to go and much that can be done to further the development of their people.
 To sum up, 10 years ago when we presented the report of the International Commission on Peace and Food, we were optimistic that humankind will grasp the uncommon opportunities provided by democratic systems of governance and technological and knowledge revolutions for achieving a world without hunger and where every individual has an opportunity for a productive and healthy life.
 The onward march of technology is still in full swing, but the political commitment to foster cooperative human security worldwide is yet to emerge.

There was no way of knowing what it was, but I didn't care.
 Whatever it was he needed I wanted to give him.
 I opened my mouth to say as much, but my vocal chords wouldn't cooperate.
 I was still trying to verbalize my feelings, when his free hand came down to my chin and gently pulled it up.
 My heart stuttered and threatened to quit as his lips slowly came down to meet mine.
 My only other experience had been so terrible that I nearly panicked, but before I could formulate a protest, or even decide if a protest was what I wanted, our flesh touched.
 The contact immediately drove every other thought from my mind.
 His lips were the perfect combination of firm and soft, and the heart that'd been all but stopped a second before sped up to heart attack rates, slamming itself against my chest in an effort to get closer to him.
 All of my senses were blending together.
 I couldn't tell if he smelled incredible, tasted like heaven, or if it was all just a side effect of the energy which had gone from tingling to crackling as soon as our faces touched.

A dramatic exception to this gloomy trend comes from the countries of Asia and the Pacific, which have made great strides in job generation during the 1980s and are poised to continue expanding rapidly.
 The Newly Industrializing Economies (NIEs) ‚Äì Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan-China ‚Äì are all facing severe labour shortages, with Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia also moving in that direction.
 But other Asian countries continue to face major challenges in creating sufficient jobs for all.
 China has created a phenomenal 100 million new jobs since 1985 and continues to grow rapidly, but the country still has a pool of 130 million surplus rural workers.
 Joblessness in Chinese cities is projected to reach 5 million by the end of 1994.
 India needs to create at least 100 million new jobs in the next ten years in order to raise all its poor above the poverty line.
 Factors Contributing to Rising Unemployment
 Although the problem of unemployment is not new, a variety of factors have combined to aggravate the difficulties confronting most regions of the world in recent years.
 As a result of the decline of global military spending by one-third in real terms since 1988, employment in defence industries has fallen steeply and is expected to decline by at least 3 to 4 million jobs or roughly 25 per cent by 1998.
 In addition, 4.5 million military personnel will be demobilized during this period.

 Flames danced across the side of one house, alerting Qurrah.
 The half-orc coiled the whip around his arm and pulled out a scrap of bone from a pouch.
 It was time to test the spells his master had taught him.
 An elderly man came around the corner, a torch his only weapon.
 He glared at Qurrah with unabashed hatred.

 The old man dropped his torch and wobbled on his legs.

 They were loud and ran round the camp all afternoon.
 And they were just as varied as the adults.
 I examined their wide noses, rounded ears, and stubby fingers.
 Those who wore no shoes had short, thick toes like trolls.
 The men had patches of hair curled on their chests and forearms and some even grew it around their chins like goats.

I felt horrible for my little brother Harry who was ten years old at the time, because they were so close.
 I also felt bad for his aging Father (my Greek grandpa) who was very ill, as this was his only son and his namesake.
 Dino‚Äôs funeral could be a book in itself.
 On the day of the funeral, we went from church to viewing to church to graveyard, always with another sermon or eulogy, with unbelievable crying and hysterics.
 I was in the family limo with my mother, my brothers and poor old Grandpa (Dino‚Äôs father).
 Before I got in the limousine a man walked up to me and introduced himself as Grandpa‚Äôs doctor.
 He handed me a bottle of small white pills and told me they were nitroglycerine tablets and to get one under the old man‚Äôs tongue if he seemed to be having a heart attack.
 Great, Grandpa is rambling in Greek and may die on my watch!
 At least Dino is not here to beat me if I fuck this up.
 So in the limo I‚Äôm tossing these little white pills in Grandpa‚Äôs mouth like candy.

Again the silence, but this time, more completely enveloped as I was by the tingly warmth that seemed synonymous with being in his presence, I was content to wait.
 "Apparently Isaac's decided there are a few things you should know.
 Don't try and tell me it wasn't him, you didn't know that particular piece of information an hour ago, and nobody else has had the opportunity to tell secrets."
 I felt myself tense up in worry, but he waved my worries away.
 "In answer to the core of your question, Jasmin thinks it's because I've finally gone over the edge, that in essence I've snapped due to the stress, and this, 'obsession,' as she terms it, is merely a novel way of committing suicide."
 My heart started racing again, but he wasn't done.
 "The other school of thought is that I'm more of a healer than anyone realized, and that I couldn't resist your obvious need."
 He'd lost me there.
 "Wait, what do you mean?"
 Alec paused for several seconds before answering.

Turns out, just because I did drugs and knew people who were addicted to drugs I was still not qualified to understand how to break someone from craving the drugs that satisfy their addiction.
 Brandon seemed better and we thought we had helped him simply because we incarcerated him at home away from his peers until he had the drugs out of his system.
 In our mind, he was cured.
 Unfortunately, the problem had not been solved so easily.
 Like any good movie, this solution came too easily and too early in the drama.
 He was such a child then, easily influenced and dealing with challenges in counterproductive ways.
 He was caught being truant, being out past curfew, being with a kid who stole a wallet.
 He was involved in multiple car accidents.
 Brandon struggled and was barely making it through high school, so we changed him to a problem-child school to enable him to graduate.
 He and his younger brother Bryce were growing apart just as I had grown apart from my brother Thomas, which was torturous for me and Lisa to watch.

He sighed, but there wasn't any real frustration to the sound.
 "Our cases are hardly comparable.
 You know I heal more quickly than you do."
 An upraised finger cut me off before I could latch onto my last remaining point.
 "The fact that your injury was less severe is really quite immaterial.
 Even the fact that shape shifter-inflicted wounds don't heal as quickly as normal for me is really a small matter when compared to just how much blood you lost before we got the bleeding staunched."
 And there was the real rub.
 Alec was well on his way to being fully healed, while I still had fits of dizziness every time I tried to stand.
 I even had to have Jasmin or Dom help me to the bathroom.
 There was no good way to know how long I'd lain there with a branch stuck through my back, but it'd been long enough for even a relatively small wound to result in near fatal blood loss.

"Can we at least go for a walk by the river?"
 Marie asked as they left the restaurant.
 "I'm not up to it.

 "I'm sorry."
 Partly for him but mostly for herself.
 What would he say if he knew that she sometimes went to a speakeasy?
 He'd probably kill her.

Mrs. Tiggs still hadn't finished grading our tests, which meant I still had no idea how I'd done.
 By the time I finally half-collapsed at my normal table in the tutor lab, all I could think about was how nice it would be to see Brandon one more time as he drove me home.
 I looked around to verify that all of the usual suspects were there.
 Geeks, check.
 Jocks, check.
 Rachel and her sinister sidekick James, check.
 I smiled at Rachel and then flipped open my math book.
 Everything went just like normal, and promptly at five I closed my binder and started stuffing books into my backpack.
 I looked up to find Rachel standing in front of my table.

This wasn‚Äôt her field.
 The forest and surrounding meadows didn‚Äôt belong to anyone, only an elf‚Äôs home was theirs.
 But I knew from past experience Evelyn would punish me for being here when she happened along.
 Sure, not physically‚Äîno elf did that.
 But I could just imagine the way perfect little Evelyn would repeat the story in town.
 Poor Elfreda, sitting alone in the weeds, couldn‚Äôt even make grass grow.
 What can we do to help her?
 We should have a Council meeting on it, I‚Äôm sure.
 Poor, poor thing.
 I stayed where I sat, forcing my eyes to the ground.

 After that we wandered around and talked to a couple of ghosts.

 Finally we just met back up with Gene and Johnny.

 That first session, so it is told, was as if energy itself had been created in that concrete empty shell, where grass pushed through the floor, straining to catch these new vibes, this new electrical Jubal.

 They cohered, they veered away and came back, like the trajectory of stars.

 He scrutinized me, and I resisted the urge to straighten my hair and brush the dirt from my clothes.

 "What's wrong?"
 She went to the bathroom for some tissue.
 "Marie?"

There was a tall brunette already waiting, so I took a seat in one of the hard-plastic chairs.
 The other girl had shorts on just like everyone else, but hers were the shortest I'd seen yet.
 In Minnesota you could always pick out the alpha females by the length of their shorts, and this one seemed to think she was at the top of the food chain.
 That or a complete slut, but with her tan skin and perfect wavy hair, I figured it was probably the former.
 She didn't look like she had to put out to get attention.
 Two minutes later, a smiling blond secretary came waddling out of what was probably the principal's office.
 I spent the time wondering if I should try to make small talk; the gorgeous girl spent it staring out the window.
 The secretary took in the two of us, frowned almost imperceptibly at the length of the shorts and then signed a form for the other girl.
 Determined to at least try and make friends, I started to smile as she turned towards me on her way out, but the expression died as soon as I met her flat green eyes.
 My heart immediately started to race, but she was already gone, moving with grace and confidence out of the suddenly too-small office.

 That thought made him sad.

A flutter of auburn hair caught my eye.
 I looked down and noticed goose bumps on the babe‚Äôs shoulders.
 After traveling the world and witnessing racial tensions rising all around, Billy Graham had grown ever more certain that the only solution was at the foot of the cross.
 He said the foot of the cross was the only place where in every sense all of us are equals.
 We‚Äôre all sinners, he said, and we‚Äôre sinners by choice.
 We choose to break God's moral laws.
 We become drunkards or fornicators, selfish, consumed with pride and prejudice and intolerance.
 But the sinful heart can‚Äôt find happiness.
 And God, he assured us, wants his creatures to get happy, which is why Christ said we must be born again, so he could give us new moral natures, new affections, new objectives, and new directions.
 What planted the hook in me was: according to Billy Graham, when you make your decision for Christ, you do it for the sake of the nation and the world.

I could feel my heartbeat climbing, slamming away at my ribs with all the energy of a full-blown panic attack, but I wasn't dizzy, just scared.
 The cafeteria workers had all turned around so their backs were facing us, a sight which kindled the first spark of anger, an emotion that burned brighter because of the fear still coursing through me.
 There was a gasp as Cassie shoved Rachel, a misleadingly casual motion that sent the smaller girl stumbling back into Alec's chest hard enough to leave bruises.
 The typical catcalls were still absent, it was as if nobody viewed this as a normal fight, like there was somehow more at stake.
 I'd been waiting for someone to intervene on Rachel's behalf.
 It was obvious she knew nothing about fighting.
 Cassie wasn't the kind of girl to fight just to prove a point and then forget about the incident afterwards.
 Just looking at her, I knew she'd remember any slight for as long as she lived, and she had enough influence in the school to make just about anyone's life miserable.
 She probably got away with things just because nobody was willing to cross her.
 Rachel was going to get hurt.

"I'd try and convince you I'm not going to do any of that to you, but I suspect that's just going to take time."
 I was busy kicking myself for having cast such a pall over the morning, when Brandon sighed.
 "We should talk about what happened to you yesterday."
 "I don't know what you're talking about.
 Nothing happened."
 Deny everything.
 It's essentially the motto of two entire generations now.
 Make them tell you exactly how much they know before you admit to anything, and then only admit to the parts they already know about.
 It's a crappy way to run a society, but I'm just one kid.
 I can't be blamed for just trying to keep my head down and survive.

As she walked into the garden, she was tempted to turn and look back.
 But that would just heighten their pain.
 With tears running down her cheeks, she quickened her steps.
 Rick watched her disappear into the fog.
 Closing his eyes, he forced himself to think about 1927.
 He pictured Marie calling out for her mother, running into her arms, crying with joy at the reunion.
 He imagined her going with her cousin Tom to a speakeasy, ordering a cocktail simply because it was forbidden, dancing the Charleston.
 He pictured her putting on his t-shirt, holding his handkerchief to her nose, crying as she thought about him.
 He thought about 1927 as long as he could and then remained there, frozen, his mind numb.
 He hoped that he'd been wrong, that he hadn't opened the door to 1927, that any minute now she'd come back to him.

Recent projections indicate that jobless ness in Russia could reach 15 million persons or 18 per cent of the work-force in the near future.
 By far the most serious problem lies in the developing world, where unemployment rates average 40‚Äì50 per cent in many countries.
 In Latin America, 192 million people representing 46 per cent of the population live under the poverty line, and 22 per cent of them are considered ‚Äòextremely poor‚Äô.
 Urban unemployment is around 8 per cent, but average industrial wages in the region fell by 17.5 per cent during the 1980s and the number of workers in the lower-wage informal sector doubled.
 Although population growth has slowed, a 72 per cent increase in labour participation rates for women is causing the work force to continue to expand rapidly.
 This region needs to double its employment growth rate to create 89 million new jobs during the 1990s in order to provide full employment opportunities for all its people.
 In sub-Saharan Africa, home to 20 of the 25 poorest nations in the world, urban unemployment afflicts some 14 million people, representing 15‚Äì20 per cent of the workforce, and is projected to more than double in the next ten years.
 Typically, youth comprise 65 to 75 per cent of the total unemployed.
 With the region‚Äôs population still growing at 3 per cent annually, these countries need to create 100 million new jobs in the coming decade just to maintain their present levels of unemployment.
 High population growth and a severe economic slowdown have generated high rates of unemployment in the Arab countries, estimated to exceed 25 per cent during the early 1990s, in spite of the very low labour participation rates among women in this region.

‚ÄúYou know I‚Äôd never do that.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúNo, Harruq, I don‚Äôt know.
 I think I know, I desperately want to believe I know, but I don‚Äôt.
 So promise me.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúAurry‚Ä¶‚Äù
 ‚ÄúPromise me now, or I will drag you back to the elves and let them deal the justice you deserve.‚Äù
 Harruq glared into the fire.
 It was such an easy promise, but could he keep it?
 What if Velixar ordered otherwise, or someone close to Aurelia struck against Qurrah?
 He sighed.

The fire shrank back to a small blaze.
 ‚ÄúMost men cowered at the sight of it.
 Do not be ashamed,‚Äù Velixar said.
 ‚ÄúThere might have been a victor, but Celestia interfered at last.
 She cast each god far beyond the sky, to where she herself had made a home.
 She gave half to Ashhur and half to Karak.
 The souls of the soldiers who fought and died alongside them were given to their masters.
 She cursed the elves who sided with Karak, branding them the ‚Äòorcs,‚Äô or ‚Äòbetrayers‚Äô in her tongue.
 Once the brother gods were locked away from the world, and each other, Celestia issued her final decree.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWhat was it?‚Äù asked Qurrah after Velixar remained quiet for a moment.

The point is, when we're stumped, or stuck, and we ask God, if an answer comes, we had better heed it.
 Okay, I think.
 I will write about reading Brother Lawrence and this trip before the next novel or anything else gets in my way.
 And by the end, I vow, I will know better how to adore God.
 Which, for reasons I‚Äôll soon learn, turns me once again to thoughts of Eric.
 After a mile or so I‚Äôm questioning whether, on that Sunday as he walked over the hill between Sylvia's house and Kenny Niedermeyer's, Eric got handed the choice to save me and/or Billy, or to save himself.
 The only answer I receive is a maybe.
 But all I need is to recognize the long shot possibility that the dearest person I have known gave his life for me and, despite the sorrow, my heart leaps with adoration.
 For a moment on Highway 101 in Pismo Beach, I feel sure that Eric was Jesus.
 Not in full, as in a Second Coming.

He sheathed the blade.
 Aurelia felt her world slow and the nightmare relent.
 _He did no harm,_ she thought.
 No killing.
 He may not be the Forest Butcher, and even if he meant to do what she feared, it didn‚Äôt mean the others were him.
 The hope felt juvenile and ignorant but she clung to it tightly.
 The magic left her fingertips, and doing her best to calm her heart, she followed Harruq back home.
 ‚ÄúNothing?‚Äù Qurrah asked when Harruq stepped inside.
 ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù
 It seemed Qurrah would leave it at that, but he clearly saw the apprehension on his brother‚Äôs face.

Keep in mind, all I wanted to do was play my guitar and write songs.
 And I was writing at an astonishing clip and artists were picking up on it, and, well, the money started coming in.
 See, in a way, I was fortunate.
 I never had to sack groceries at Piggly Wiggly or teach school, or cut lawns.
 Writing songs, I learned early, brought in the bucks.
 And a lot of the talent coming out of Nashville, well, a lot of those guys were singing my stuff.
 See, at that time, everyone wanted to play and sing, but not everyone could write.
 So I wrote.
 And, even if we never performed any of it, which we didn‚Äôt, they were my songs, and they were popping up on the radio.
 Sebastian did, ‚ÄúLemmy Caution‚Äôs Incubus,‚Äù and I think that was really the start of it.

Wondering what she‚Äôd died of, he turned the page and found more information about her.
 "Jefferson Tranton handpicked Davis Runyon, heir to the Runyon publishing empire, as a husband for his daughter.
 Chandler Runyon had sold the business when his son was 19 years old so that, in actuality, Davis Runyon was heir only to the family fortune and to the power of wealth, not to the power of position.
 Eager for such, he courted both the young woman and her father.
 Tranton and his son had had a falling out when the younger Tranton had begun his own company in 1925, and because he had disinherited his son, Tranton began grooming Runyon to run his company as well as to become his son-in-law.
 In February 1927 Runyon became vice president of the import/export enterprise, and seven months later he married Tranton's daughter.
 "The marriage was apparently an unhappy one.
 Marie, who had, in her youth, had a reputation as a vibrant, fun-loving, somewhat mischievous girl, was rarely seen in public after her marriage.
 Reports suggest that she was a victim of spousal abuse.
 The official cause of her death in 1941 was an infection contracted during the birth of her youngest child.

‚ÄúYou.
 You held me back as my mother died.
 You held me and made me watch her die.‚Äù I could almost taste the acid in my voice.
 He was still backing away, holding his hands in front of him palms out.
 A wordless hiss escaped my throat as I felt the fire coursing through me light in my hands.
 He would burn for this.
 Burn.
 I was standing now, walking step for step toward him as he backed away.
 He said nothing, his face calm as the fire flared and I raised my hands to strike.
 And then everything went black.

I opened my eyes to see that I was in a cave.
 I peered at the entrance of the cave to see that outside it was dark.
 I walked toward the entrance when something stopped me.
 ‚ÄúDon't go into the shadows, Jazell,‚Äù a familiar voice said.
 It was the voice from my last dream.
 I whirled around in a circle, looking for the source of the voice.
 There was nothing here.
 ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I asked, trying to calm down.
 ‚ÄúCan I trust you?‚Äù ‚ÄúTrust me like your shadow,‚Äù the voice said again.

The only problem with Steve is that he was double-crossing the narcotics officers and they had come to discover his deception.
 Steve and his girlfriend, Ashley were highly addicted to Oxy and their combined drug habit made it necessary for him to continue to deal Oxy to the bigger buyers while tossing a few small fish to the officers to appease them and satisfy his deal.
 The officers knew too that Steve was beating his girlfriend and forcing her to perform ‚Äúhappy ending massages‚Äù and sexual favors to support her personal addiction to Oxy.
 Brandon was one of the small fish that Steve provided information on.
 Brandon had become so addicted that he could no longer supply the drug in quantity because he and Tiffanie consumed over $1000 a day by snorting or smoking it.
 Brandon had gone from a large dealer to a junkie who would do anything, say anything and sell anything to get his next fix.
 Brandon had become dispensable to Steve and the other large dealers, as he was now an Oxy addicted con man in constant search of his next dose of this potent drug.
 Brandon could trade prison for setting up the double-crosser Steve.
 Officer White was insistent that the time frame for this deal was short.
 Brandon was very ill detoxing, and the fact that he had been busted and he was on lockdown at his parents‚Äô house was common knowledge on the street.

I wanted to try and make eye contact to test my hypothesis, but was afraid of what I'd see.
 The tingling was spreading, no doubt a bad sign.
 Maybe I'd hit my head even harder than I thought.
 "It was all just a game for you, wasn't it?"
 There was anger behind the voice now, subtle, like the scent of rain the night before a storm, but definitely there.
 I started to bristle; I even took a breath to explain what'd really happened.
 Only the truth wasn't any better than the story he'd fabricated.
 It was worse even.
 I'd much rather this cocky, spoiled, rich boy be mad at me than feel pity.
 I'd had enough pity from my mom to last years.

Qurrah said not a word.
 His eyes were far away, and his lips moved but produced no sound.
 ‚ÄúQurrah?‚Äù Harruq asked again.

 Qurrah jolted as if suddenly waking.
 ‚ÄúThe dead,‚Äù Qurrah said.

 Sure enough, the arrow-ridden bodies stirred.

I knew the outcome if I didn‚Äôt, and I was already in trouble enough.
 Shortly after her tirade insisting I stay until I had earned permission to leave, the one-sided argument ran its course and Fannie tired of looking at me and sent me on my way.
 I trudged out of the kitchen, through the main sitting area, and into my room.
 It was dark except for a small beam of light from a knothole in the wall.
 Fire was the one magic I had mastered; I had been able to light lanterns and candles for as long as I could remember, but I didn‚Äôt bother.
 If I was in this room, I wanted to be alone.
 And in darkness I felt more so.

Wow, talk about a chauvinistic pig.
 It wasn't worth getting bent out of shape.
 I let my door swing shut, and walked over to Rachel's side so that I could see the entire parking lot.
 Empty as it was, it didn't take very long to realize Britney's little white Saturn was gone.
 "I thought you might still be here."
 The voice caught me by surprise.
 I probably would've jumped and screamed a little if I hadn't recognized it.
 Brandon was walking towards us with his characteristic casual stride, and I felt my heart speed up a little as I remembered our conversation from earlier in the day.
 "Brandon!

I was suddenly glad Britney had abandoned me.
 If it resulted in me seeing Brandon again today it couldn't be all bad.
 In fact, my life felt pretty much perfect right now.
 Wait, not quite.
 If he'd greeted me with a hug in addition to the smile, then things would have been perfect.
 I felt myself blushing almost as soon as the thought crossed my mind.
 My family wasn't...hadn't been demonstrative.
 I wouldn't know what to do if he hugged me.
 In an effort to cover my embarrassment, I turned back to Rachel and James, only to feel my jaw figuratively hit the ground.
 James was standing between Rachel and Brandon, slightly crouched in a posture that looked strangely familiar.

‚ÄúIn a court full of human nobles, he broke through, slew four of them, and then took the king‚Äôs left ear.‚Äù Velixar laughed.
 ‚ÄúHe killed five guards before he was slain.
 Two more died in the fiery consumption of his corpse.‚Äù
 Qurrah smiled at the image.
 Harruq‚Äôs blood heated at the thought of battle, but the coldness in his stomach refused to succumb.
 ‚ÄúVaelor cannot yet risk war,‚Äù Velixar continued.
 ‚ÄúHe must have all the people see him as a peaceful man driven to conflict.
 History does not favor the warmongers, not among the peasants and scribes.
 They favor so-called great men, driven to war by horrid acts of others.‚Äù

 "Whatever the cause, it's commonly held that this was the point at which the Earth ceased to be a paradise.
 Bountiful gardens were replaced by weeds and thorns.
 Hurt and betrayed, the Sun distanced herself from the Earth, lessening the number of life-giving rays warming his surface.
 Possibly that was his plan.
 If she'd totally abandoned him then her children would've all died."
 I felt my eyelids begin to flutter, as my breathing slowed to match Alec's.
 "Whether that was his intent or not, the Sun didn't completely abandon him, either out of respect for what they'd shared, or possibly out of concern for her children.

 We met at a small church charismatic enough so that nobody minded when she stood in the midst of a service and offered her latest poem.
 Long ago, Olga had discovered that what she needed most was God.
 She would hike and pray her way up Cowles Mountain, a mile and a half of rocky trail, then call her best friend Warren so they could pray together, sometimes for hours.

Aurelia stopped them.‚Äù
 Qurrah rubbed his chin, lost in thought.
 He glanced at Harruq, a tiny smile forming on his face.
 ‚ÄúMay I meet her?‚Äù
 Harruq immediately began blubbering.
 ‚ÄúNo, but you see, I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs ready, and you might not‚Ä¶‚ÄåI need to let her know you‚Äôre coming first!‚Äù
 Qurrah chuckled.
 ‚ÄúWhy do you worry?‚Äù
 The big half-orc let his gaze drop to the floor.
 ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs an elf.

‚ÄúBecause the wolves would have fought to the death, and Grand Council does not kill animals with magic.‚Äù I remembered my mother.
 ‚ÄúOnly elves?‚Äù His mocking smile widened.
 ‚ÄúOnly elves.‚Äù They thought killing an animal with magic was evil, dark, but they were hunting us down.
 To burn us.
 I considered the alternative‚Äîpierced through with arrows, blessed with a prayer‚Äîand I laughed.
 His eyes were intense as he reached to gently cup my neck, fingers resting at my spine, thumb grazing the base of my ear.
 I felt him urge me forward, and my breath caught, heart stuttering into a broken lope.
 And then Ruby was beside us from out of nowhere, her words startling me back to the cold, dull room.
 ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre coming in.‚Äù Chevelle leaned back, his fingers brushing my collarbone when he pulled away.
 I bit my lip at the tingle that ran through me, and the corner of his mouth turned up into a different kind of smile.

‚ÄúOf course, but I am not sure how I can help,‚Äù she said.
 Rodregas nodded, but said, ‚ÄúCan you go around to the other top finishers and talk to them, and also go around tonight to the other squires and try to get a feel for them.
 See if  you can find out who people want to win and why?‚Äù Imeralda was clearly confused by the odd request, but nodded, and after a little talk she slipped away to the food line and within moments was in an animated discussion with a few squires at another table.
 Rodregas thought Doi‚Äôvan might ask, but he showed no interest and instead said, ‚ÄúWhile most of the knights are too high and mighty to talk to a Hellborn, the staff is not so closed mouthed.
 The greater sigils are said to be guarded twenty four hours a day in a great chamber in the very heart of the Cathedral.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd did you ask if sworn men were allowed in with a new knight?‚Äù asked Rodregas with a smile.
 ‚ÄúActually the topic did come up,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan with a chuckle like rocks in a land slide.
 ‚ÄúWhile guards are usually not allowed in, it is not unusual for close friends or advisors to go in with some of those of the blood; to share their wisdom on the best possible greater sigils to take on.‚Äù ‚ÄúI will assume,‚Äù said Rodregas, ‚Äúthat they had never heard of a Nymph entering the chamber, much less one of the Hellborn?‚Äù ‚ÄúAElves are not uncommon and actually more Orqui than I expected.
 One servant thought that Nymphs used to go in during his father‚Äôs, father‚Äôs time, but not any time recently.
 No one could even imagine a Hellborn going into the Chamber,‚Äù agreed Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúWell as far behind as we are, we might not even get the chance to try to bully our way in,‚Äù Rodregas said.

I think of my wife who has been left in silence for nearly four hours.
 I think of my sons, Brandon completely fucked up from his drug addiction and Bryce away at college completely unaware of what is happening and what risk his dad is about to take.
 It occurs to me that Bryce and my wife may never forgive Brandon if something were to happen to me.
 I recall their little league baseball games and soccer teams I coached.
 All of the art projects which we proudly displayed with the help of refrigerator magnets over the years.
 Particular events in their life pop in and out of my head.
 Their future begins to enter my mind and I hope and pray that I will see Brandon free from his addiction one day and see Bryce graduate college.
 Who will they marry one day, how many children will they have, will I be a grandpa or a memory?
 Too many thoughts are packed in my head as I realize this is my life and my family‚Äôs life passing before me as the moment of truth approaches.
 Perhaps all this worrying is for nothing or perhaps the worst is about to happen.

"How can you be sure?

 Alec shook his head, his eyes strangely gentle.
 "No, if they were hanging around outside we'd be able to smell them."
 "So not only are you faster and stronger than normal people, you've also got noses like real wolves?"
 "Of a sort.
 That's not really important though.
 Let's get you inside."
 I nodded and started towards the door, only to blink as Alec stepped in front of me.
 "May I have permission to enter and make sure it's safe inside?"

When he climbed into bed, he fell asleep instantly.
 Not long after, Harruq rose, took his swords, and left for his own meeting.

 [section break](break.png)
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late,‚Äù Aurelia said, stepping out from behind a tree.
 Harruq shrugged and held out two branches he had whittled into crude imitations of swords.
 ‚ÄúHad to make something for me to spar you with,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúThose sticks are unnecessary,‚Äù Aurelia said as she took up her staff, the tiniest hint of a smile curling on her lips.
 ‚ÄúDraw your swords.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù Harruq asked, raising an eyebrow and gesturing to her completely unarmored figure.

The four of you were chosen because of your unbreakable bond, but even that can be broken.
 You are strongest when you are together, so don‚Äôt let yourselves be separated.‚Äù ‚ÄúWouldn't it be called 'an breakable bond', then?‚Äù I asked her.
 She laughed but then grew serious.
 ‚ÄúBe very careful.
 We all know that we picked the right four, but it would be a shame if something happened to all of you before you could complete your goal.‚Äù That got my attention.
 ‚ÄúYou know how we became half-lings?
 You know who attacked us that day?‚Äù ‚ÄúI've said too much already,‚Äù she said and backed up.
 ‚ÄúI must go.‚Äù ‚ÄúWait!‚Äù I called.
 ‚ÄúWait; tell me what's going on!

Which meant I spent the day getting shocked.
 I was grateful when we finally stopped to make camp.
 I was afraid they would resume training after dinner, so I found a place off by myself and pretended to rest as I went back to reading the diary.
 Today was exhilarating.
 For the first time in I don‚Äôt know how long, I was out of the castle.
 Free from practice, free from duties, free from walls.
 Though tricky to set up, the spell worked on Rune.
 I showed up at practice early and whispered the words in case something went wrong and he heard.
 I can‚Äôt imagine what my punishment would have been, though it might have been worth it.
 He fell asleep quickly and I ran as fast as I could, my pulse pounding with excitement.

A spider, he thought.
 Velixar should have told him it was like becoming a spider.
 A mere thought of moving sent him spiraling, reappearing place to place.
 Ending the spell left him totally disoriented.
 His sight returned to normal, and it felt a little like falling from a very tall tree.
 As he retched on his knees, he looked about, discerning his location.
 He was beside the building the two elves were in, directly underneath their windows.
 He could see the tips of their arrows sticking out, glinting in torchlight.
 Two adjacent homes were already ablaze, their occupants still inside.
 Qurrah turned and grabbed the frame of the door.

The wave sent Qurrah crashing against a giant undead man still wearing rusted platemail.
 The collision blasted the air from his lungs.
 When he hit the ground, stars filled his vision.
 Dieredon fought but could not resist that same wave of power.
 The point of his blade halted a foot from the top of the black hood before he flew back.
 In the distance, Qurrah watched his master glaring at the damned elf who had fallen like a mad man.
 ‚ÄúScoutmaster,‚Äù Velixar growled, his voice deep and dark like an ancient daemon of old.
 ‚ÄúTwice you have looked upon me and lived.
 No more.‚Äù
 Dieredon twirled his bow, his face calm and emotionless.

Contrary to expectations, the initial months of the programme have yielded spectacular results.
 Inflation fell to zero per cent in the first week after the issue of the new currency and remained below one per cent during the first five months.
 Instead of a massive outflow of foreign currency through conversion of superdinars, people have rushed to cash in their foreign currency, resulting in a 60 per cent increase in the nation's reserves during the first three months.
 One of the most significant features of the programme has been its fair distribution of benefits and low social cost to the population.
 In contrast with the widespread outrage felt by Russian citizens over repeated episodes of demonetization and confiscation of household savings, the Yugoslav people have enthusiastically accepted the new currency as representative of a new deal for the poor and the working class.
 In addition, instead of the severe contraction of output experienced elsewhere, production rose by more than 100 per cent during the first five months, stimulating an increase in employment and demand for new investment.
 Real tax revenues have increased significantly.
 The astonishing initial success of the programme can be attributed to its balance and comprehensiveness, and to the following specific features: the government's recognition that stabilization was absolutely essential to economic recovery; the widespread public support for the programme, which was in large part due to the efforts to protect weaker sections from its harshest effects; the simultaneous relaxation of controls on industry; support for a natural rather than a forced process of privatization, based on the specific circumstances of each firm rather than on ideology; continued price supports for agriculture and a minimum wage for labour, which are crucial for maintaining food supplies and social stability; and rejection of import liberalization in order to protect domestic manufacturing against a major shock during the initial period of recovery.
 Possibly the greatest strength of the Yugoslav programme is that it was of necessity conceived by people within the country rather than by foreign experts, and depended entirely on domestic resources and capabilities for its accomplishment, rather than on pleas for foreign assistance.
 Self-reliance released the creativity, generated the determination and mobilized all available resources to make the transition successful.

The peace force would intervene automatically and unconditionally ‚Äì defensively and, if necessary, offensively ‚Äì to protect the sovereignty and international borders of any member country, provided that it conformed to the rules under the charter.
 The organization could also assist members in fighting drug trafficking and terrorist activities.
 The benefits of this cooperative peace-keeping mechanism would be manifold:
 Since the charter would bind members and the alliance to eschew the use of force and aggression for any reason, it would represent a stabilizing, non-provocative, non-offensive defence.
 Its charter could also include specific provisions for close association with other international forces.
 Its combined strength and technological capabilities would exceed those of any of its members and constitute a substantial deterrent to aggression against any member country.
 It would significantly reduce the costs of security for members, possibly by up to 50 or 75 per cent, without compromising their legitimate security needs.
 The more members, the lower the defence expenditure required by each, both because the collective force would be larger and because the number of potential adversaries would be reduced proportionately.
 The organization of a World Army, run on well-defined and transparent lines with appropriate mechanisms for control and responsiveness, would help eliminate the need for countries to maintain their own large standing armies.
 Ultimately this could enable other nations to follow the lead of Costa Rica, which abolished its military forces several decades ago.

Policy measures at the national level influence trade and investment flows and employment rates in other countries.
 Economic growth and expansion of employment in one country enhance employment opportunities in other countries as well.
 Therefore, co ordination of policies is in the interests of the global community.
 A comprehensive and coordinated international effort is called for to improve the global climate for economic growth and job creation by evolving stable and supportive policies to regulate capital flows, foreign trade, debt, commodity pricing, immigration and labour movements, transfer of technology, investment, military spending and the arms trade.
 We set forth below a broad policy framework to stimulate global job growth with the aim of achieving full employment early in the twenty-first century.
 1.World Employment Programme: Raising incomes and creating jobs in the developing countries is the best way to promote global economic growth and employment generation in the coming decades.
 The World Summit on Social Development should call for a comprehensive World Employment Programme to stimulate more rapid growth in developing countries as an engine for global economic expansion.
 The International Labour Organization has operated a programme for the past two decades, but solution of the employment problem requires an integrated approach that transcends the scope of any single international agency.
 The programme should establish specific objectives and co ordinate efforts to stimulate international investment, increase labour market flexibility, promote productive skills, diffuse technology, eliminate protectionist trade policies that retard growth, increase trade between developing countries, and promote international cooperation on taxation systems to encourage more labour-oriented tax codes.
 2.Coordination of macro-economic policies: The efforts of the industrial nations to achieve higher rates of economic growth and job creation are stymied by the need to maintain macro-economic stability at the same time.

We ate in silence and mounted the horses as we had each day before, but it was obvious nothing was the same.
 How could it ever be?
 I was racked with guilt as we made our way up the mountain.
 I purposefully rode behind him, glad at least to be able to control the horse on my own.
 Small patches of snow had started to dot the landscape, the vegetation a darker, sharper green.
 Occasionally the sun would break through the mist, making me squint, and I would appreciate the calmer, hazier atmosphere.
 Gloom, as they called it at home, in the usually sunny village where I would spend my eternity.
 I wondered where I would be kept as a captive, if there would be windows, if I was unfit for public view.
 Chevelle picked up speed after we passed through the more difficult part of the trail and then we rode fast the rest of the day.
 I struggled to keep up.

The type and magnitude of change needed today is comparable to that embodied in President Roosevelt‚Äôs New Deal for the American people during the Great Depression, at a time when 25 per cent of the workforce was unemployed: to the Indian government‚Äôs decision to launch the Green Revolution in the mid-1960s to achieve self-sufficiency in foodgrains, at a time when the country was highly dependent on imported food to stave off famine: and to Mikhail Gorbachev‚Äôs initiatives late in the 1980s to end the Cold War and transform Soviet society.
 Is Full Employment Possible?
 Few will argue with the compelling logic, justice and idealism of this view, but many will question the feasibility of practically implementing it.
 As long as we continue to believe that society is truly helpless to manage job growth, there will be strong resistance to the full employment goal.
 We must recognize that the present status and functioning of our economies is the result of specific choices that have been made in the past, based on priorities and values that were relevant or dominant at the time, but which we certainly are not obliged to live with indefinitely and, in fact, are continuously in the process of discarding in favour of new values and priorities.
 The rapid adoption of environmentally friendly policies around the world is positive proof of how quickly the rules, even economic rules, can change when there is a concerted will for a breakthrough.
 So too, the welfare policies of the European Union that have resulted in a 70 per cent rise in national income over the past two decades, but only a 9 per cent increase in the number of jobs, were due to conscious choices that favoured the employed over the unemployed, not the inevitability of the market.
 Recent economic debate in the United States has brought this truth to the fore.
 At a time of historically low levels of inflation and high levels of unemployment, the US Federal Reserve has pursued a policy of raising interest rates in order to prevent a potential rise in inflation at some time in the future, which has had the immediate effect of dampening growth and slowing job creation, just at the time unemploy ment rates were beginning to fall towards normal levels.
 This has prompted some economists to question the notion of a ‚Äònatural‚Äô rate of unemployment.

 ‚ÄúFrey, we need to talk with you about something.‚Äù Oh, perfect.
 I waited, and he proceeded carefully, ‚ÄúYou know you are bound.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I agreed, even though I wasn‚Äôt clear how I was partially bound.

He then realized that he should go up and check out the laboratory for anything else of value, and check out the dungeon to make sure all the prisoners had been freed.
 He had brought a proper crow bar from his visit to the smith‚Äôs and made short work of the laboratory door.
 The room had several large circles in the floor and tables and shelves along the side.
 The shelves held bones and bowls of strange fluids and other items whose uses he could not imagine.
 Anything that felt foul he threw into the fireplace, after getting a good flame going.
 Several books and strange containers ended up in the fire, though he did find two books that felt of magic that he kept.
 He also found a small statue of a strange green mechanical frog that had that magic tingle to it.
 He could not imagine its use; it appeared a simple toy, but he put it in his pile to take.
 There was a heavy oak cabinet in the corner which he forced open.
 Inside were large pottery containers, which he had seen before.

Despite his agony as the very bones of his body rearranged themselves, he managed to call out a warning to Inock, to flee back to the Moon.
 The love of Inock for Adjam was so great that he rushed to his brother's side, where he too fell victim to the Earth's plague."
 I wanted so very badly to remain awake, but wrapped comfortably in the warmth of Alec's arms, I couldn't fight off exhaustion any longer, and I felt myself drift off into dreams of two brothers who survived the plague, rising from the ground after seven days, one a wolf, the other a jaguar.
 Chapter 24 I'd been awake for several minutes before I finally remembered where I was.
 I rolled over, opened my eyes, groaning when I saw that the other side of the bed was empty.
 Who knew what Alec thought.
 He'd obviously fled his own room to avoid talking to me when I finally woke up.
 Donovan's gentle knock and appearance at the door pulled me up short before I could really get going on the self-loathing.
 "Good morning Mistress Paige, I hope you slept well."
 He limped into the room with his odd, somehow graceful lurch, and then set down a tray filled with eggs, French toast, orange juice and everything else you'd expect if you were to go to IHOP and order their 'everything but the kitchen sink' special.

I waited impatiently for her to raise her head again and hoped whatever it was wasn‚Äôt permanent.
 She finally glanced up at me, smiling an easy smile.
 I looked nervously at my wrist.
 It was magnificent.
 A simple outline of a bird with outstretched wings marked the delicate skin at the base of my palm.
 Unbelievably tiny runes surrounded the bottom of its wings, making a pattern appear.
 I smiled as I praised her.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beautiful.‚Äù One eyebrow shot up and she jumped from the bed, grabbing my wrist and pulling me with her.
 I hoped she hadn‚Äôt smudged the design.

It took a few seconds to realize the sub was the one yelling.
 Nobody seemed very interested in making room for him.
 The reason it took so long for my brain to start working again was that I couldn't seem to think about anything other than Alec.
 He was looking down at me with an expression I'd never seen on his face before.
 I still couldn't read it, but it was new and somehow seemed like it belonged there more than his normal impenetrable mask.
 "What's going on?
 Is she okay?"
 The sub had finally pushed his way through the crowd, and looked like he was about two steps away from a total panic.
 Alec stood, and it wasn't until I went up at the same time that I realized he was carrying me.
 "I think she'll be fine, but maybe I should get her to the nurse.

 His stance was similar to Rodregas‚Äô own.
 Rodregas went slowly but steadily, keeping his guard up.
 The boy kept his hands up.
 When Rodregas went in low he took the blows to his body and went for Rodregas‚Äô face.
 Against another opponent it was the right move.
 Unfortunately for the boy, his blow seemed to come at Rodregas slowly.
 Rodregas easily dodged as he landed a strong blow to his opponent‚Äôs chest.
 Rodregas was used to sparring with Doi‚Äôvan and was surprised when his opponent went flying into the line of contestants and did not get back up.
 Rodregas waited a moment and then looked at the knight who stood outside the match.

I was more comfortable watching him, looking for a reaction, than the passing elves.
 Two men walked by in the opposite direction, their dark eyes on us.
 My cape blew back, exposing the shape of my leg, and they hissed indecent comments.
 I gasped, shocked, and my horse picked up its pace to ride beside Chevelle.
 Chevelle held up two fingers slightly to silence me.
 We hadn‚Äôt ridden more than a quarter of the way into town when he turned the horses to a medium-sized structure, stopping before a water trough.
 He dismounted effortlessly and pulled me from my horse and into the building in a few quick steps, closing the door behind us.
 It was dark inside, his fingers lingering on my arm.
 I felt him shift, waving a hand as several lanterns around the main room lit, giving off a soft glow.
 He indicated a door on the rear wall.

These average figures disguise significant differences in performance of countries within the OECD.
 Since 1950, Japan‚Äôs employment rate has risen from 43 per cent to around 50 per cent, while unemployment has remained in the 1 to 3 per cent range.
 The overall proportion of the population employed in the European Community has declined by 1 per cent since 1965 and is presently just under 41 per cent, but the percentage of the working age population employed has remained more or less constant over the past three decades, at 67 per cent, whereas in other OECD regions it has risen significantly ‚Äì to exceed 75 per cent in North America, Scandinavia and Japan.
 Europe‚Äôs lower labour participation rate is attributable to a number of factors.
 A far higher percentage of the European workforce was engaged in agriculture 25 years ago and has since shifted to non-agricultural sectors, an adjustment that occurred in the United States during earlier decades.
 During the 1980s Europe chose a high-wage path to growth, passing on the benefits to the existing workforce but creating relatively few new jobs; whereas the United States, with a similar economic growth rate over the decade, showed lower income growth per worker, but a steadily rising employment rate.
 Europe is now confronted with the need for structural adjustment to compensate.
 In the United States, the extent of the unemployment problem is partially disguised in the form of low-wage jobs, which distribute total income over a larger number of workers.
 Twenty per cent of all full-time US workers have incomes that fall below the official poverty line for a family of four, though only a quarter of these live in households whose total income is below the poverty line.
 Real wages in the United States have not risen significantly over the last 20 years due to the dramatic increase in the supply of labour as a result of a 62 per cent increase in female participation since 1960 and the entrance of the baby-boom generation into the workforce.

I looked down at my Spanish test and wondered how I'd gotten here.
 There were answers on the page.
 They were unmistakably done in my awkward scrawl, but didn't make sense.
 I flipped the page over and found more of the same.
 My eyes idly traced down the page, finding blanks and almost of its own accord my pencil reached out and filled them in with words that seemed familiar, but whose meaning I couldn't seem to pin down.
 I resurfaced as I walked into the tutor lab, unsure if I'd passed anyone I should have greeted.
 I sat down at my usual spot and pulled out a book at random as Britney stomped into the room and threw her books down.
 She was obviously mad, but once again I couldn't muster enough concern to figure out what'd ticked her off.
 I blinked several times as I realized Mrs. Campbell had been speaking to me for several seconds.
 She was important, one of the few teachers that actually liked me.

In instances such as Cambodia, Rwanda and Somalia, the vacuum created by the complete collapse of political and economic institutions necessitates a broader role for the UN in re-establishing the peace.
 Peace building has thus far been defined as post-conflict actions to support reconstruction and to strengthen and solidify peace.
 The concept needs to be broadened to include pre-conflict actions and expanded to encompass a wider array of potentially destabilizing factors that lead to conflicts.
 The Commission supports the establishment of an International Centre jointly operated by the UN Security Council and UNESCO to implement peace-building programmes.
 Peace-building activities should be expanded to address security threats issuing from environmental degradation, poverty, migration of population and refugees.
 Many cases of ethnic conflict have an under lying basis of economic deprivation that must be addressed before tensions will permanently subside.
 Others can be mitigated by the introduction of positive economic incentives for cooperation.
 Economic cooperation is already dissipating ethnic tensions and conflict in the Middle East.
 It can be creatively fostered in the Balkans and elsewhere.
 In other cases, the modification of the electoral and constitutional systems in a culturally appropriate manner can reduce or eliminate tensions in ethnically divided countries.

But they also increase the danger of frustration, disappointment and violence.
 The end of the Cold War was expected to usher in an age of peace, but actually violence is on the rise in both developing and developed countries because of the widening gap between human expectations and achievements.
 This growing gap between expectations and achievements is at the root of contemporary turbulence worldwide.
 The popular and some times violent demand for freedom and participatory democracy, the return of religion in politics, surging ethno-nationalism and intolerance, and rising urban crime are disparate expressions of this phenomenon.
 In Eastern Europe, where a peaceful revolution from within has broken the shackles of statism that long confined the energies of people, these energies now surge forward in high and eager expectations of a better life.
 Already there are growing signs of impatience, disappointment and frustration arising from the greater hardships that have come in place of the greater benefits that all expected.
 It is essential that these energies be channelled into constructive pursuits that generate tangible improvements.
 Otherwise they may recoil from the effort and look backwards to a failed system or be guided by false prophets on a path that once again poses a threat to other nations.
 The phenomenon of growing violence in an age of increasing affluence seems to contradict the thesis that poverty is one of the major causes of violence, until we realize that the increasingly visible signs of prosperity the world over raise the expectations and aggravate the sense of deprivation and revolt among those that have been by-passed by the general progress.
 Greater political and social freedom can only further magnify this tendency.

 I was resigned now, the fury gone, and so was the screeching, the pain.

I confess to finding myself more sympathetic with Luke than with the patriarch Abraham.
 Soren Kierkegaard calls Abraham the Knight of Faith, a fellow so sure of God that even the idea of questioning a command to murder his own son was unthinkable.
 Good for him.
 Honest.
 Luke the horse breeder, I can admire, and Eric I can adore, in part because I know their flaws, their humanity.
 Luke's are exposed in "A Father's Story".
 Eric's I can remember, and for reminders, I have his report cards.
 Adoring a human may require us to have developed beyond pure selfishness.
 Yet once that's accomplished, the task seems to come naturally.
 But, at my level, even attempting to adore God is calling for plenty of effort.

 "I predict our house is soon going to be full of all kinds of knickknacks and gadgets."
 Smiling, she pulled him closer for another kiss.
 He was constantly thinking of her, buying her gifts and designing adventures for her.
 Sighing, she leaned into him as their kiss went on.

He bellowed, letting the pain spark his rage.
 One archer continued to fire out the window, believing his companion capable of finishing a single warrior.
 He believed wrong.
 The elf fired only one more shot before Harruq crossed the room.
 The arrow lodged into Harruq‚Äôs side, and then Salvation tore through his bow and into flesh.
 A kick sent the remains tumbling out the window.
 The other archer pulled back and fired at point blank range.
 Harruq roared as he felt a sharp pain bite into his neck.
 His mind blanked.
 He dropped his swords.

"Wait.
 You need to put on shorts and a shirt over your bathing suit."
 "Oh.
 OK."  She went to do as he said.
 Marie had been to the shore before, but it had been years ago.
 Her father didn't think it was appropriate for a young woman of her position to be parading around half naked.
 If only he could see her now, she thought with a grin as she took off her shirt and shorts.
 There were only a handful of other people on the beach.
 Rick and Marie went for a stroll--or rather, Rick strolled while Marie ran into and out of the surf.
 When they returned to their blanket an hour later, she was tired enough to be talked into sunbathing for a while.

 "Home?

 "I'm a little tired.
 I'd just like to go home."
 She felt a little anxious as she walked into her house.
 She wanted Rick to hold her, to caress her hair and kiss her temple and whisper that he loved her.
 But she'd never have that again.
 When she'd chosen to return home, she'd given him up forever.
 She managed to hold herself together until she was in her room.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôd be west,‚Äù said the same rude guard.
 ‚ÄúYou know which way west is, right?‚Äù
 Harruq‚Äôs hands opened and closed as he imagined his swords within them, ready to butcher for blood while the soldier proceeded to say the word ‚Äòwest‚Äô as long and drawn out as possible.
 ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù he mumbled and hurried off.
 Accompanied by a young man scribbling on a sheet of parchment, Alvrik sat at a small table in front of a group of people waiting in line to address him.
 Harruq slipped into the back and tried to calm down.
 Never before had he done anything like this.
 He had stolen food, fled from guards, lived in poverty, and kept to himself.
 For he and his brother, that was life.
 What the abyss was he doing asking for work?

The attack was still trying to overwhelm me, but Brandon not knowing the full extent of my weakness robbed it of some of the momentum necessary to roll me all the way under.
 I managed some kind of reply, one that might've even been witty, but which apparently didn't manage to cover up the fact I wasn't really okay.
 We drove in silence the rest of the way into town, and by the time we turned into the school parking lot I'd come back to myself enough to be desperately looking for something else to say.
 I needed something cool enough Brandon wouldn't write me off as a lost cause.
 Wish-granting fairies somewhere were working overtime, because as Brandon turned off the engine, I saw a mob of people over by one of the smaller entrances to the school.
 "Wow, I wonder what's going on over there."
 We were both out of the car now, and it seemed the most natural thing in the world to grab Brandon's arm and tug him over to the crowd.
 It wasn't until I felt the iron-hard muscles under my now-tingling hand that I realized what I'd done.
 I felt a surge of heat wash over my face and neck.
 Brandon for once didn't have an easy comeback to defuse the awkwardness.

I wished I'd had the memories of that to sustain me.
 And I wished--"  She stopped, pressing her lips together.
 Marie looked at her.
 "You wished he'd gotten you with child."
 Mrs. Tranton nodded, finally meeting her daughter's eyes again.
 "It would have made life difficult, and it would have been a shame and an embarrassment to my family.
 But I would have had a part of him.
 And I would have loved that child with every fiber of my being."
 She took Marie's hand, squeezing it.
 "I don't know if it's any comfort, but I understand how much you're hurting."

Qurrah gave a soft laugh and then nodded.
 ‚ÄúI believe that shall suffice.‚Äù
 Harruq did not know why, but the short exchange sent chills running to the pit of his stomach.

 The night was hot and miserable when Velixar met the half-orc brothers and told them the news they had long waited to hear.
 ‚ÄúAhrqur was successful, and in ways beyond what I could have hoped for,‚Äù he told them, joy dancing in his features.
 ‚ÄúKing Vaelor has long felt inferior to the kings of his past.

Their parents stood with the principal ready for their arrival at the office.
 As they entered the room it wasn‚Äôt hard to see the anger and disappointment.
 They were from different sides of this small town.
 My father‚Äôs dad was a butcher, his wife a seamstress.
 My mother‚Äôs dad was an oil rig grunt of American-Indian decent, and his wife, a meek submissive homemaker.
 Neither parent thought the other was good enough for their child, let alone the fact that they were both still children.
 Once the reason for the marriage was revealed, their parents accepted it as best as they could.
 My father‚Äôs parents arranged for them to live together in a small home while they finished school and awaited the birth of their baby.
 It was the late fifties and a pregnant teenager was an embarrassment.
 Shame followed the couple wherever they went.

Then I watch a family, a couple and two daughters, strolling beside the river.
 As I study them, one at a time my vision cuts deeper, and I see the creator alive in each of them.
 And as I picture Jesus, I recognize some of His expressions.
 Patience.
 Forgiveness.
 Loyalty.
 Love.
 I spend a while adoring God.
 Nowhere near as much as He deserves.
 But more now than before.

 "No.

He had evolved in a short year from the position of a detoxing addict receiving compassion to the position of a former addict providing compassion.
 Brandon is giving back!
 Brandon considers the staff and students his second family.
 We don‚Äôt see Brandon often because he works in the ‚Äúboonies‚Äù many hours away but we talk to him almost every night.
 He usually calls us late after his shift ends around 11 pm.
 My wife and I put him on the speaker phone when he calls so we can both share his day with him.
 He has no car so he walks about one mile back on the shoulder of the narrow country road in Werner Springs as he talks to us.
 You can hear the crunching sound of the road‚Äôs gravel beneath his feet and imagine the gait of his walk from the delay between the sounds.
 The need for material objects is no longer what he desires and either are the drugs he once craved.
 We are touched by his compassion, his love and his maturity.

I never set out to write a dark fantasy.
 I had two characters in my head, troubled half-orcs without home or family and whose decisions would one day bathe a world with war.
 To tell their story I had to start at the beginning, and the beginning is not kind.
 Reading some letters and reviews, I‚Äôve seen just how dark I‚Äôve gone.
 What you have just read is a slight alteration from my original manuscript.
 I have not changed the brothers‚Äô actions.
 Instead, I have tried to show a bit more into their thoughts, their hearts, and their souls.
 I have had people call Harruq and Qurrah evil.
 Perhaps you agree.
 Much of what they have done certainly is evil.

‚ÄúThere is little to tell,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúI was his slave.
 I cleaned up after him while he fed me scraps of his failed experiments.
 I slept in a cage.
 One time he caught me practicing words of magic.
 As punishment, he shoved a hot poker down my throat, ruining my voice into what you hear now.
 One night tribes of hyena-men stormed his tower, wanting vengeance for the many of their kind he had taken to butcher and maim.‚Äù
 Qurrah kept his eyes low, unable to meet Velixar‚Äôs gaze.
 ‚ÄúI was afraid when they came, but as I watched Master slaughter hundreds of them with his golems and his shields of bone I felt at home amid the carnage.
 I knew then what I was to become.‚Äù

I wandered down the white-walled corridor until I found another sign and turned left.
 There was a tall brunette already waiting, so I took a seat in one of the hard-plastic chairs.
 The other girl had shorts on just like everyone else, but hers were the shortest I'd seen yet.
 In Minnesota you could always pick out the alpha females by the length of their shorts, and this one seemed to think she was at the top of the food chain.
 That or a complete slut, but with her tan skin and perfect wavy hair, I figured it was probably the former.
 She didn't look like she had to put out to get attention.
 Two minutes later, a smiling blond secretary came waddling out of what was probably the principal's office.
 I spent the time wondering if I should try to make small talk; the gorgeous girl spent it staring out the window.
 The secretary took in the two of us, frowned almost imperceptibly at the length of the shorts and then signed a form for the other girl.
 Determined to at least try and make friends, I started to smile as she turned towards me on her way out, but the expression died as soon as I met her flat green eyes.

Rodregas nodded; he had been waiting for the comment, but he had thought it would be Imeralda who brought it up.
 ‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúunless you have a way of smoothing it out.‚Äù Rodregas waited for a few seconds as the three approached the main farmhouse building.
 The walls were of thick cut stone and it was built on an impressive scale for a farmhouse, though worn-looking.
 Of course, there were no signs of a roof, doors or windows.
 As they entered the yard, the feeling of the hair standing up on their bodies settled down and instead a feeling of fullness replaced it.
 The horses had been acting up and Rodregas hoped that with the energy smoothing out, the horses would stop fighting their lines.
 Though in truth the horses seemed to be getting more agitated.
 As the magic smoothed out Rodregas smiled and said, ‚ÄúThe ley line would be as much of a problem as a help unless, of course, the farmhouse is made of Nymph stone.‚Äù Rodregas expected the sound of pleased surprise but instead heard alarmed in-drawn breaths from them both; he saw that they were looking to the right, where he suddenly noticed movement.
 Two female Dire Cats stepped out of the orchard and made their way to the farmhouse.
 They had a relaxed, bored look.

3.Upgrade skills: Absorbing new technology, raising productivity, improving the quality and competitiveness of exports ‚Äì all depend on the skills of the workforce.
 Labour productivity has been increasing in East Asia by 10 per cent a year, half of which is attributable to investment in education and technical skills.
 Training institutions and programmes in most developing countries provide only a narrow range and low level of skill acquisition to a small portion of the population.
 Raise skills to increase productivity by vastly expanding the lower tiers of the agricultural, craft, technical and vocational training systems at the local level to provide practical training in job-related skills to the saturation point.
 Imbalances between supply and demand for skills exist at all levels in developing economies.
 Make a careful assessment of present supply and demand for key skills.
 Compare the density of different types and levels of skill in countries at the next higher stage of development and evolve programmes to raise the quantity and quality of skills to that level.
 4.Improve marketing: The organization of marketing is typically one of the weakest links and, therefore, one of the greatest barriers to economic growth and job growth.
 Brazil set up a distribution system for the export of citrus fruits that has enabled it to become the world's largest exporter of this commodity.
 Improve distribution and marketing systems, especially for agricultural produce, by identifying missing links and establishing successful model programmes that bridge the gap between rural producers and urban or overseas markets.

I'd have to be sneaky to get the two of them together.
 Mrs. Campbell needed a little bit of reassuring when she stopped by my desk, which I did happily now that my personal universe was looking up once again, and then I dug into my homework with near-normal gusto.
 Time flew by all too quickly.
 Soon it was just me holding down the fort and trying to take care of a trio of freshmen girls who seemed to be at least slightly ahead of the normal cramming curve.
 I was glad they weren't waiting until the day before the test to come in for help, but it was looking like tomorrow wasn't going to be any fun.
 Maybe I'd get lucky again, and most of the lazy ones would give up before my shift started.
 I turned around from explaining for the fourth time to the third person why you couldn't prove congruence of two triangles with the nonexistent angle-angle-angle postulate, only to find that Britney had slipped out of the room.
 It was possible she'd just gone to the restroom.
 I tried to remind myself of all of the places she could be, and all of the reasons she might have left that didn't involve abandoning me here.
 Rachel met me on my way back to my table to gather up my books.

 I have not been able to see her.
 The tedium of my duties is getting to me and Father has been relentless with my studies, pushing me harder and harder to strengthen my control.
 My sister has been exploring the mountains.

I know I can depend on you, this is just important enough that I needed to make sure you understood what's riding on your discretion."
 I finished with the first third of the bottle, and then nodded.
 "I won't say anything.
 What exactly are we going to see?"
 "Not a what, but a who."
 Much like he'd done when we'd been fleeing from my house, Alec picked me up and then slung me around so I could wrap my legs around his waist, and my arms around his neck and chest.
 This time Alec wasn't sprinting, but he still set out at a pace that made conversation impossible, so I just relaxed into him and enjoyed being so close for a second time today.
 Once we stopped, I slid down Alec's back and looked around.
 The tiny cabin set back into the rocks before us blended into the hillside so well, I probably wouldn't have noticed it if Alec hadn't stopped so close.
 As soon as he was confident I could stand unaided, Alec gave me a reassuring smile, and then knocked gently on the door.

All that made him maintain it was the knowledge that her father would kill him if he laid a finger on her before marriage.
 He glanced at his watch; he'd get Marie home by midnight and then spend a couple of hours at Mae's establishment.

 Marie smiled.

Rick asked when "I Love Lucy" went off.
 "No.
 But I-I don't feel like watching TV any more right now.
 Could we do something else?
 Will you show me how to use the washing machine?"
 After they'd put in a load of clothes, they had some ice cream and then returned to the living room to read.
 Rick had gotten her the Dragonriders of Pern series, since those books were about a world that was new to all readers and had very few offensive elements.
 She'd wanted some romances, but he was afraid that they'd be too explicit for her.

But Davis stepped back and turned to draw her arm through his, grinding his teeth.
 He wanted to throw her to the ground and tear off her clothes, and every time he was alone with this beautiful ing√©nue, his self-control took a tremendous beating.
 All that made him maintain it was the knowledge that her father would kill him if he laid a finger on her before marriage.
 He glanced at his watch; he'd get Marie home by midnight and then spend a couple of hours at Mae's establishment.
 "Now it is a perfect evening."
 Marie smiled.
 "Every night in Hollywood must be like this."
 He laughed.
 "What makes you think that?"
 "Hollywood is so romantic.

It was virtually guaranteed we wouldn't learn anything which was fortunate or I might have missed something.
 Once my mind latched on the question of what had been different than normal, I didn't hear a word anyone else said.
 It wasn't until I was back at my locker and midway between switching out my History book for my Physics notes that I finally realized what it was.
 Normal juniors didn't sit at a lunch table and figure out what to do about anything.
 They complained, they gossiped, they boasted about what they were going to do, but it was all just an exercise designed to reinforce the social order.
 I'd seen it played out in multiple grades, among groups ranging from the jocks down to the lunatic fringe, and while the details changed, the overall form didn't.
 It was a universal constant, like the speed of light or maybe gravity.
 Only Brandon's group hadn't been gossiping.
 They'd been discussing, brainstorming even.
 I didn't know what it meant.

Imeralda then proceeded to eat the acorn shaped fruit; it took some work.
 It seemed to be a bit harder than any ripe fruit Rodregas knew of, but he followed her example and found that while it was tart it was amazing.
 It tasted of... Rodregas did not know what to call the flavor; the words that came to mind were sunlight and rain and the smell of a forest at night.
 When Rodregas finished the fruit completely he felt more whole but was also sad that it was gone.
 Imeralda seemed in great humor.
 ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù she said.
 She dropped to her hands on the edge of the branch and then dropped down as if she was only feet from the ground which, strangely she was.
 Rodregas saw her standing on the ground.
 It was not that she had floated down.
 It was as if she had she had been in a regular sized tree.

 Her eyes filled with tears.
 "I'm so sorry, Rick.
 It-it probably would have been better for you if I'd never walked into your life."
 "Don't say that!"
 He hugged her.
 "I don't know how I'm going to live without you, but I can't imagine never having loved you.
 And I'm so glad you told me that you love me."

Which, for reasons I‚Äôll soon learn, turns me once again to thoughts of Eric.
 After a mile or so I‚Äôm questioning whether, on that Sunday as he walked over the hill between Sylvia's house and Kenny Niedermeyer's, Eric got handed the choice to save me and/or Billy, or to save himself.
 The only answer I receive is a maybe.
 But all I need is to recognize the long shot possibility that the dearest person I have known gave his life for me and, despite the sorrow, my heart leaps with adoration.
 For a moment on Highway 101 in Pismo Beach, I feel sure that Eric was Jesus.
 Not in full, as in a Second Coming.
 But in a way so that Jesus entered him and took possession.
 While this thought grips me, both Eric and Jesus become so precious the word adore feels timid and weak.

I felt as if she stood there for me to prove l wasn‚Äôt a cop, who likely would leave at least his underwear on.
 She pointed to the bed that was now covered in a bright beach towel.
 I laid face down and she didn‚Äôt offer anything to cover me up as you would in a traditional massage.
 She straddled my buttocks and began to massage my back.
 She told me that she didn‚Äôt have sex as part of her massage.
 I assured her that I just wanted a massage from a pretty young lady and I had no other motive.
 I repeated that I often got massaged from the same older woman and I thought it would be a treat to get a massage from a beautiful young one.
 As I lay there, I could see her in the mirror and we talked from this reflection.
 She pressed the issue of buying the pills.
 She climbed off of me and stood up next to the bed between me and the mirror.

I mean, I could have left.
 There were no bars or anything.
 But, I had no will, I had no good reason to do anything.
 Lorelei would just sit with me and we‚Äôd talk about small things, you know, what it was like outside, what she was reading, some painting she was doing.
 Almost anything but me getting back to the music.
 See, Lor, instinctively knew that was the sticking point, that me making music again was the key, but, also my deepest fear‚Äîthat I‚Äôd lost it all.
 That I‚Äôd never write another meaningful song.
 I‚Äôd rather not say which hospital this was.
 Just because of, you know, the privacy thing.

"Better?"
 "Yes," she breathed.
 He'd never kissed her arm before.
 When he was gone, she dropped onto her bed with a smile.
 But it slowly became a frown.
 She was beginning to think she didn't understand her betrothed at all.
 She'd never seen him get angry before he‚Äôd proposed.
 And she'd thought that being betrothed would mean they'd spend more time together, but they were actually spending less time together.
 He had dinner with her family two or three times a week, but he and her father always retired to her father's study for the rest of the evening.

The second blow shattered it.
 The third blow smashed the head to pulp.
 Rodregas probably should have picked up Nordien‚Äôs mace and shield, but he also knew that without plate armor, he could not afford a long drawn out series of pounding matches.
 Rodregas would fight like a lion instead.
 He charged the next closest squire who was approaching another squire.
 His new opponent never knew he was coming.
 He was heavily covered in armor with little visibility so he never saw Rodregas jumping on him from behind.
 This opponent was smaller and crashed to the ground at the unexpected weight of the attack.
 Rodregas was more careful in ripping off this squire‚Äôs helm, and punched him in the face but once.
 It was enough.

 Besides, Alec wouldn't have let the four of us go alone if we'd been planning on staying so close to Brandon's territory.
 Vegas was definitely the best option given the time restrictions we're under."
 I'd settled in for a long trip, only to realize as we crossed the state line that Jasmin was positively shattering the speed limit.
 I managed to limit myself to a single gulp, when I saw just how fast she was going, but everyone else was so relaxed that I finally managed to unclench my fists and join back in the conversation.
 It helped that the Mercedes was so smooth, and that I knew Jasmin had reflexes and reaction time that would've made any Indy racer insanely jealous.
 Apparently there wasn't a single cop on duty, because we made it into downtown Vegas in what I was sure was record time.
 It had to be.
 Jasmin hadn't dropped below triple digits until we were less then fifteen minutes from exiting the interstate.
 It wasn't until we hit the first store that I started to get an idea of what Donovan had been hinting at.

The game was against our team‚Äôs rival, Grossmont High School.
 My mother graduated there.
 The gym was ancient.
 The double entry doors each featured a quartet of small windows.
 When the gatekeeper refused to let us in because the tickets were sold out, Kenny‚Äôs usual good nature expired.
 He raised a fist as though to sock the gatekeeper, a boy in an ROTC costume.
 But instead of punching the kid, he drove his fist through one of the small windowpanes.
 The gatekeeper hollered.
 The next instant, we found ourselves surrounded by teachers, coaches, and a platoon of the ROTC.
 While the chatter of several witnesses turned it all into gibberish, and the gatekeeper shouted, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been drinking,‚Äù Kenny stood still, staring at his bloody fist as though wondering how it happened.

 I turned the corner, and my house came into view.

 Out of my left eye I saw the outline of a creature.
 It was heading through the woods in the direction of my house.
 I swore under my breath and took off for the woods.
 My feet crunched on the fallen branches and leaves.
 I could see the creature ahead of me.
 I didn‚Äôt have much time.

The smile I received was sickly sweet, but left me with the impression I'd just failed a test.
 "Okay, we'll see you another day then?"
 I pulled out my Spanish and Biology books, more because they were the two subjects I was doing the worst in than out of any real desire to study them, and wandered the halls until Mr. Whethers took pity on me and asked if I wanted to study in his classroom.
 Sitting there all by myself felt so lonely.
 When you boiled it all down, I had a grand total of two friends in Sanctuary.
 Rachel and Brandon, both of who seemed to dislike the other, and neither of whom I was really sure I could count on.
 It was fine to only have two friends, or even just one friend if you knew they would do everything they possibly could to make sure they wouldn't let you down.
 It was entirely different when you weren't sure you could trust the people around you.
 Brandon was too good to be true.
 I pretty much expected any day now he'd come to his senses and realize he could do a lot better.

From Imeralda‚Äôs expression Rodregas knew it was something more dangerous than a trade caravan coming down the road.
 Imeralda squatted down next to them and whispered, ‚ÄúA slave caravan is coming; it‚Äôs small but they have a score of guards.
 We need to back up before they get here.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have good cover here,‚Äù he whispered back, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs check them out as they pass.
 They are probably going to stop at Stallion‚Äôs Perch.‚Äù After much debate between the three of them Stallion‚Äôs Perch was their destination, a small keep that was known to breed Dire horses for the Immortal Guard.
 ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt,‚Äù responded Imeralda with a whisper.
 ‚ÄúThey are traveling with a patrol of Immortal guards.
 I think there are only four, but scout patrols often have a warrior with a minor sigil of enhanced senses.
 He might spot us.‚Äù As she spoke Rodregas noticed that Imeralda had a strange expression on her face, she was scared, but also seemed sad.
 ‚ÄúWhat kind of slaves do they have?‚Äù Rodregas asked in a gentle voice.
 Her body jerked more directly toward him, surprise covering her sad expression for a second.

 ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù A wry smile crossed his lips and I couldn‚Äôt help but focus on them for a moment.
 ‚ÄúBecause the wolves would have fought to the death, and Grand Council does not kill animals with magic.‚Äù I remembered my mother.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù she asked, her voice curious on his repeated questioning.
 ‚ÄúBecause I am wondering if our ‚ÄòPaladin‚Äô has a connection to the Dire Cats.
 I know a Celestial lion was used in the ceremony and whoever our Paladin is I assume he now has it‚Äôs essence, and those two were taken as the Celestial‚Äôs mates.‚Äù  Imeralda and Doi‚Äôvan looked at him, and then she slowly added, ‚ÄúAnd what was one of your first actions?
 You freed them from the dungeon.
 Dire Cats are smarter than regular lions; they might see you as an ally or part of their herd.
 No wait, I think with cats you call them prides.
 But I wonder how they see Doi‚Äôvan and me?‚Äù she asked.
 Neither Doi‚Äôvan nor Rodregas had an answer to that question.

Of course I did make a couple of stipulations."
 The music started up before I could ask what he meant.
 Almost before I realized what was going on, I found myself twirling through some kind of modified waltz.
 For the first time in my life, I was glad Dad had drilled me for all of those weeks when I'd turned twelve.
 My first dance had still been complete and utter misery, but at least I managed not to trip over my own feet as Alec led me around the room in time to archaic music.
 The rest of the pack fell into formation around us, all dancing much more proficiently than me.
 James and Dominic led the way, with Jasmin and Rachel dancing off to our left.
 Amazingly enough, Isaac and Jessica were far and away the best; he was leading her through steps that were at least twice as hard as anything we were trying.
 For maybe the first time I'd ever seen, Jessica was happy.
 She seemed completely in her element, utterly oblivious to the number of people watching her every move, and I felt just a little of my resentment dissolve.

Harruq snarled, the elf inside him all but invisible.
 He charged, recklessly hacking at Aurelia.
 ‚ÄúWhy do we fight?‚Äù she asked again, desperately trying to block every swing.
 Blood covered her arms, and another swing cut through her dress, slicing into the beautiful flesh of her leg.
 ‚ÄúWhy, Harruq?
 Why!‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know!‚Äù he cried.
 Strength surged into him, dark and unholy.
 In the blink of an eye, he twirled both swords, knocked Aurelia‚Äôs staff from her hand, and then looped his right arm all the way around to bury Condemnation deep into her stomach.
 Everything, all fighting, all arguing, all bleeding, living and dying halted at that moment.

I still stay awake nights reliving the ignominy, forgetting to celebrate how we came together briefly, fiery angels.
 I think I was riffing, partly, adding to what I‚Äôd written, making it up as I went along.
 By that 16th run-through, my voice was tired anyway, and the guys were playing like they were drugged, and the song sounds like that.
 I love that cut, man.
 We hit some other place with that one.
 You wanna know about the ending‚Äîthat last bit before the hidden loop?
 Jim and I had been talking about Sergeant Pepper‚Äôs and we wanted some kind of, what they call, lamination on the end, something like what the Beatles did with ‚ÄúStrawberry Fields,‚Äù you know, sort of incorporating found sounds, etc.
 So at the end of ‚ÄúKim‚Äù we let Dickinson play with the limited equipment he had, and here‚Äôs some of the stuff that‚Äôs in that final few seconds of concrete dada: a piece of the Treasure House theme song (backwards), Crafty reading ‚ÄúThe Crucible‚Äù from our school textbook, a piece of Schoenberg, a piece from The Ventures played through some car speakers, and then some street sounds Jim got by simply walking out onto Madison Avenue with a microphone.

Hiking maybe?
 Only I could count the number of hikes I'd actually participated in on one hand.
 Surely something like that would've stayed with me.
 Someone gasped as the crowd shifted around, distracting me from my half-formed suspicions.
 I looked over at the exterior wall of the school and felt my jaw drop.
 Maybe Mom had read the story about the three little pigs a few too many times to me when I was growing up, but I'd always thought of brick as the strongest possible building material.
 I didn't have any idea if it really was, but it seemed incredible that anything could've wreaked such damage.
 The bricks on the wall next to the door were cracked and set back in the wall, almost like they'd been hit with some kind of wrecking ball, and the concrete of the sidewalk had gouges crisscrossing its surface like some kind of abstract painting.
 "There's nothing to see here, kids.
 I want you to all disperse and go to your home rooms."

‚ÄúDear Celestials in the heavens, we open our hearts to you and we accept our duties as your warriors here in the world.
 Let your courage fill our hearts and your strength fill our arms.
 May we know the guidance of your twin children, Honor and Justice.‚Äù He then knelt down and pulled one of the two short swords from his weapon harness; he crossed his arms and laid the blade across his own upper arms.
 It was possible, only with great concentration to do this without dropping the sword or cutting himself.
 His instructor had taught the squires this simple prayer.
 It guaranteed that the squires stayed focused during meditation.
 Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda looked at him as he knelt in the grass with the sword naked on his bare arms.
 Rodregas spoke carefully so as not to tip the sword and said, ‚ÄúIt is called sword meditation.
 My instructor would start us out with the prayer and then we would meditative on our duty.‚Äù ‚ÄúFor how long?‚Äù asked Imeralda.
 ‚ÄúUntil you are sure of what your duty is,‚Äù Rodregas replied, hearing the voice of his old drill Knight Captain.

This close, I could feel the anger radiating off of him.
 I almost took a step back when he turned towards me.
 "I realize it's unreasonable to ask you to trust me right now, but I'm going to need you to do so.
 Can you remain quiet for the next few minutes?"
 I wanted to ask why, but it was obvious we didn't have the time for a lengthy explanation.
 I nodded.
 "I trust you.
 After everything you've done, I know you wouldn't hurt me."
 Alec turned towards Rachel, but she shook her head before he could even open his mouth.

Can we foster love of diversity and pluralism in terms of religion, race, language, colour or political belief?
 In our view, there are uncommon opportunities now to find the solutions to these basic challenges facing contemporary human society.
 We have tried to deal with them in a concise manner in this report, which concludes that commitment to the principles of democracy and human diversity, equity in terms of gender, economic condition and sustainable lifestyles, is fundamental to achieving both a better common present and a better future.
 Personally, it has been a privilege working with a highly distinguished group of women and men, whose sole concern has been a better life for all.
 I wish to thank every member of the Commission, as well as the many others who have helped us, for their time and vision.
 The Member Secretary, Mr Garry Jacobs, however, merits a special mention for his total dedication to the principles which inspired the setting up of ICPF.
 Throughout the last five years, he has devoted his time and extraordinary talent to the work of the Commission.
 He has been the principal catalyst of the Commission's work.
 In his heavy responsibilities, he has been ably supported by Robert J. Macfarlane and Robert van Harten.
 I wish to record our sincere gratitude to this unique trio.

 Jason threw knives calmly at the other monster while Emily casted fire by his side.
 I, however, was jumped on by something entirely new.
 They were small and stubby, the size of dwarfs or gnomes.
 Their skin was shriveled and grey, and hung off their bodies like cold clothing.
 Their eyes were a bright yellow that matching their teeth and their fingers looked like gnarly old trees.
 And the smell; it was awful.

With public opinion widely divided over the best course of action, it is necessary to win back the understanding, support and endorsement of the population for an alternative programme which the major parties and social groups can back.
 This requires educating the public to understand both the costs and benefits involved in any reform strategy, the trade-offs between immediate advantages and immediate sacrifices required to establish a new and stable equilibrium.
 3.Economic strategy must be balanced: A market economy can be introduced gradually or step-wise, but it cannot be introduced in a fragmentary or piecemeal manner.
 Deregulation of prices was the most prominent feature of the strategy in most countries, because it was the easiest to implement.
 But under conditions of shortages in economies dominated by huge monopolistic enterprises, price deregulation led to skyrocketing prices and spiralling inflation.
 A market flourishes only when several essential conditions are met ‚Äì freedom of pricing, freedom of entry and exit from industry, free flow of information, unrestricted movement of goods and services, competition between enterprises, control of monopolies, and private ownership of property.
 The entire package of free market practices must be implemented hand in hand, otherwise it does not work.
 Freeing pricing without first regulating or dismantling monopolies, promoting privatization of land and enterprises, ensuring free flow of goods, and establishing wholesale markets and multiple distribution out lets lead to speculation, soaring prices, hoarding and falling production.
 Historically, the free market evolved over centuries in conditions of surplus production and stable currency, neither of which exist in Eastern Europe today.
 Efforts to accelerate the development of the market will have first of all to meet the political, legal, social and economic conditions historically required for its creation.

 He gave a curt nod at my reaction, his head still dipped as he walked away.
 I wanted to speak but the words choked me.
 I wrapped myself tighter into the cloak as Chevelle constructed a hasty shelter.
 I was his responsibility, but surely he loathed me.

 He stumbled to the ground.
 His face and armor were camouflaged with greens and browns, but just grass would make it difficult to go unnoticed.
 Still, he had no choice but to try.
 He tucked his bow beneath him and then smashed his face into the dirt while sprinkling grass atop his head.
 He shifted his legs back and forth until as much grass sprang up around them as possible.
 He covered the rest of his body in his cloak.
 A few words of magic shifted its colors, better emulating the nearby terrain.
 He tucked his arms underneath him, closed his eyes, and waited for his fate.

 She didn't take her eyes off the screen, and because it was free of sexual innuendo, she understood most of the comedy.

Something in me wanted to confide in her, was willing to risk the pain of facing reality, but I was too far gone to be able to put what I was feeling into words.
 I shook my head again, not sure if it was a refusal or something else entirely.
 Rachel took it as the former and sat down next to me, pulling her knees up tight against her chest.
 A few seconds later I heard the howl of an after-market exhaust fed by a turbo-charged engine.
 The green Honda that came screaming through the parking lot was hardly recognizable as an Accord.
 It was approaching too quickly, but I couldn't bring myself to care.
 Besides, Rachel seemed unconcerned.
 Rachel helped me up as the car came to a screeching halt, all four tires locking up to slide it around so that the passenger side was facing us.
 The over-tinted windows smoothly slid down to reveal that James was indeed the driver, and he wasn't any happier than he'd been a few seconds earlier.
 I started towards the back seat, only to feel Rachel's surprisingly-firm grasp guide me towards the front seat.

 However, they could find nothing but the black stone of the wall; no door appeared under any fingertips.

The two shared several blows.
 The third time that he retreated after taking a blow, the guard went for the kill.
 The guard extended his whole body out in a lunge, thrusting his long sword out to its full length.
 The guard saw Rodregas‚Äô braided leather armor and steel sword and thrust with the point.
 The lunge was perfect, the guard went for dead center, and even though Rodregas had been waiting for a similar move, the thrust almost caught him off guard.
 The guard had only one problem, one that he could not have anticipated.
 Rodregas had been taking easy swings, not revealing his true speed.
 Once the guard committed, Rodregas brought both of his swords down and met the lunging blade.
 Rodregas could not meet his sword edge to edge, but it was thrusting out and he caught it and pushed it down and to the left.
 At the same time he moved his body to the side and in close.

In those first years back, the times I lived for were coaching Cody and the team during practices and ball games at Kuhlken Field, home of La Mesa National Little League.
 Named after my dad since he had been president and organized the renovation of the field.
 During our games, pulling for Cody, I came to understand why a father I knew dropped dead in the stands, when his heart failed while his son was pitching.
 As teenagers, my kids carried on the family tradition of abject rebellion, to the degree that I wrote a Reader story about the Tough Love group I was attending weekly.
 The year my kids began to climb out of the mud, I met Pam.
 * Back when I had only one child, someone told me that two was as easy or easier than one.
 Whoever said that ought to be gagged.
 At least in my family, while one kid slept, the other wouldn‚Äôt.
 When one behaved, the other raised hell.

The commodifying of the sixties, if you will, as embodied by the soul of Buddy Gardner.
 Buddy ‚ÄúSlipshod‚Äù Gardner, Memphis‚Äô answer to Jerry Garcia, Memphis gift to the world, from integrity and precocity to sell-out.
 So much is lost now, so little written down, so little recorded.
 For those with the stamina to search it out, Black Lung made one album, released on the Pepper label, a little Memphis soul mixed in with their own acid-blues.
 It was called Turntable Poison.
 Some say it sounded like The Rascals crossed with Hot Tuna.
 One cut comes to mind, a piece they played in every set at The Shell, the ballad, ‚ÄúMr.
 Handy and Hakel-B√§rend.‚Äù  On the LP they insisted on the extended version with Buddy‚Äôs long, side-handed solos, slick as molten lead and the twelve minute drum solo by Skippy Quetzalcoatl, effectively killing the album‚Äôs potential sales but insuring the group a spot in infamy alongside the lost tapes of Mudboy and the Neutrons and the missing five hours of von Stroheim‚Äôs Greed.
 There was also the shorter, ‚ÄúBlues for Wendy Ward,‚Äù with its plaintive chorus, ‚ÄúThank you for at least that sweet ache,‚Äù a phrase Buddy made sound like a supplication to the gods.
 ‚ÄúWendy Ward‚Äù got some air play around the country, on the late night FM stations, a minor flickering fame which only whet Buddy‚Äôs appetite for more, for larger radio audiences, larger followings, more groupies, better food backstage.

 Such a great request, a desire for destruction that most would hesitate before.
 For Qurrah, though, it was a fate he had long expected.
 It was within his blood, the cursed, the race of the ugly and the destructive.
 Yet it had been his elvish blood that had him banished.
 Such foolishness.
 Such idiocy.

Not in her looks.
 She was taller and red haired.
 But in her expression, I read the same message I got from Karen‚Äôs sweet face.
 It said, I‚Äôve been hurt bad and know how it feels so I‚Äôll be nice to everybody and try not to make anybody else feel that way.
 A thousand and some miles from home, I was lonely enough to once again ache for a best friend.
 So while I admired this barmaid, who looked about three months pregnant, I dreamed she and I would roam until we discovered the right small town, where we didn‚Äôt know anybody.
 There she could leave behind the sorrow of getting ditched by the creep who knocked her up.
 I meant to love her baby like my own.
 But on the third evening, not long after she had sat with me and chatted in a dovelike voice about strange and outrageous visitors to the bar, a guy with several tattoos came for her.
 As she walked out with him, she waved goodbye to me.

 It wasn't the most flattering comparison ever invented, but at least it allowed me to try and convince myself I'd imagined the near-violence.

If it is maintained, the adoption of democratic forms of government by the nations of Eastern Europe and the developing world will help ensure peaceful relations between states, which is the most fundamental precondition for accelerated economic development.
 The marriage of democracy and disarmament can transform the world ‚Äì abolishing wars, eliminating nuclear arsenals, liberating hundreds of billions of dollars for building a better common future.
 In economic terms, the shift to democratic government presents an opportunity for more rapid development in these countries.
 During the post-war period of technology-driven industrialization, there is a strong correlation between a representative form of government and rapid economic development.
 This relationship is reciprocal.
 In democratic countries freedom of expression and exposure to independent media awaken people to expectation of a better life and encourage them to take initiatives that lead to prosperity.
 At the same time, the democratic tendency is strengthened substantially by rising standards of living.
 As democracies distribute political power, they also tend to distribute the benefits of science, technology, information and education, which are the essential building blocks of economic development.
 Democracies provide greater access to resources, permit greater social mobility, and encourage institutional innovation.
 Not surprisingly, today all of the high-income industrial nations, as well as the top 25 ranked nations on UNDP‚Äôs Human Development Index, are liberal democracies.

It was the same aching realism that'd devoured nearly a month of my existence before I finally decided I had to try and go on with my life, for Mom's sake if for no other reason.
 I panicked when I realized just how badly I wanted to slip back into that twilight world where nothing hurt, where it didn't matter if people liked me or not.
 The one where I still had all three of the most important people in my world.
 The fear that I'd give in, that I'd end up in a hospital during the day or two it took Mom to realize I hadn't made it home from school, pulled me back sooner than normal.
 For a second my mind inhabited a body that wouldn't obey any of the normal commands.
 Fear snaked out from my center when my eyes wouldn't open, but before my heart could really start accelerating, my eyelids started functioning again.
 The desks on the route between Alec and I were lying haphazardly on their sides, but there wasn't any sign of Alec.
 Mrs. Alexander was looking down at me, concern etched into her features, and the beginnings of a crowd was starting to form as the rest of the students came over to look at the freak.
 Only something wasn't right.
 They weren't towering enough.

There was even a dwarf climbing the slide.
 Wait, hold on.
 A dwarf?
 I elbowed Emily in the arm, ‚ÄúUh Emily, is a dwarf using a slide a normal thing?‚Äù I nodded in the direction of the dwarf and her eyes widened in surprise.
 She jumped off the swing and grabbed me by the arm.
 She ran over to Jason and gripped his arm with her free hand, pulling us both after her.

I can take care of the pain though."
 There was a reason I'd never had the slightest inclination to give blood, but fear of needles or not, I couldn't bring myself to protest, so I just shut my eyes and gripped Alec's hand as Donovan stuck the needle in several different locations.
 The blessed numbness quickly spread out to encompass my entire foot.
 Working with a sure quickness any surgeon would have envied, Donovan wrapped my ankle and then examined his handiwork with a nod of approval.
 "That should take care of the pain and immobilize it so it can begin healing, but it is vitally important that you don't put any weight on it, Mistress Paige."
 Alec gripped Donovan's shoulder in thanks, and then nodded as Donovan excused himself to go see to Jess.
 "We should go too.
 Poor Jess."
 Alec shook his head.
 "They've already got her mostly settled down.

The one who had stabbed him had the most aggressive posture: he looked tall and strong; Rodregas knew he had to take him out quickly so he moved in hard.
 None of the attackers seemed to be wearing armor nor did they have any weapons, other than the largest man, who held what looked to be a garden rake.
 Rodregas charged, bulling his way into the lead attacker and knocking him down.
 The assailant fell, being surprised by Rodregas‚Äô actions.
 Rodregas grabbed him by the hair with his left hand and hit him full in the nose with his right fist.
 The man crumbled.
 Two others closed in with a group tackle.
 The one on the right came in too close, and Rodregas gave him a good hard jab with his elbow in the stomach.
 Rodregas heard his attacker‚Äôs entire breath exit at his blow and he followed him to the ground.
 Rodregas followed up with a roundhouse kick and laid a good blow into the kidney area of the other man.

‚ÄúMy turn to ask a question,‚Äù said Rodregas.
 ‚ÄúHow did you connect the three of us to these crimes?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret shrugged and smiled and said, ‚ÄúTo be honest, I did not really think you were the ones.
 I simply did not like you, and the way you hung out with non-Celestials.
 It is unnatural.
 Now, it is my turn to ask a question.‚Äù ‚ÄúActually,‚Äù interrupted Rodregas, ‚Äúyou already asked me about being an old soldier.
 Let me answer that first.
 I was a sergeant in Ravenhurr‚Äôs guard and I am afraid I have become what I learned to hate more than anything, an Immortalist.‚Äù Rodregas paused and took a deep breath.
 What he said next was hard even for himself to say, ‚ÄúIn truth, I am an old man who had his time on this world and did not do much with it.
 But now I have stolen the body of a very promising young man.
 I will die feeling guilty for what I have done, but I plan to take a few of you with me.

No one person should be so attractive, not when there wasn't enough of him to go around to every single woman in the world.
 For a few seconds I forgot all about the reasons I didn't like him, and just wished he was sitting in front of me instead of two rows behind me where I couldn't see him.
 Then I realized what his arrival really meant.
 Rachel had stood me up.
 She wasn't on the bus, and she apparently hadn't come with her brother, so she wasn't coming.
 I knew I should reserve judgment until I'd given her a chance to explain what'd happened, but it was hard to remember that when faced with Alec's air of superiority.
 Rachel was nicer, but she was still a Graves.
 Maybe this was just a sign of things to come.
 Apparently I wasn't the only one put off by Alec's snobbishness.

‚ÄúHe will rise to the heavens, from the very pits of hell, to crush all half-lings and to take their very souls.

 I wouldn‚Äôt want to be that half-ling, that he spears through the head!‚Äù This time they were rolling on the floor, howling in laughter.
 Well, I didn‚Äôt think this was very funny at all.
 What was funny about getting speared through the head?
 I had a feeling the King they were talking about was Kojas, and I really didn‚Äôt want to be around to meet him, especially if it meant my head was going to become well acquainted with a weapon.
 That is, if I was even a half-ling like the dwarfs claimed I was.

 My hand slipped to my knife but Emily grabbed my hand to keep me from drawing it from its leather case.

Hell, we were kids.
 But, when I wasn‚Äôt writing, playing, I was with her‚Äîlet‚Äôs call her Debbie because every girl back then was named Debbie‚Äîin front of her house, practicing our manumission, handjobs and fingerings and oral sex.

The shock of seeing her disappeared at the reminder.
 ‚ÄúAre you here for council?
 To collect me?‚Äù My voice was colored with the shame of being a criminal.
 Bird-killer.

 Surprised, she glanced at Chevelle and then back to me, forcing a smile.
 ‚ÄúAre you all right, Frey?‚Äù I stood there baffled, and then remembered screaming.
 I cleared my throat.

‚ÄúYes, we did, that's right!

There was no way I could've known that the gray monster who casually sliced through walls and two-by-fours with his wickedly curved claws was Brandon, but I was somehow certain.
 He was built just like Alec had been Friday night, only so much bigger that he had to crouch forward to avoid hitting his head on the unusually high ceilings.
 Donovan faced off against one of the first wolves, but it was obvious he was no match for the grace and power of his opponent.
 The gentle, aging butler was knocked to the ground between one heartbeat and the next.
 I was mercifully spared from seeing the wreckage left when Brandon's wolves moved on, but there was no doubt in my mind that Donovan was dead.
 Screams, distant enough that they had to be coming from the other wing of the house, reached out and pierced my heart.
 There wasn't any way to be sure whether or not it was Rachel or her mother, but ultimately it didn't really matter.
 Brandon was going to kill all of us.
 Another door caved in under a blow from Brandon's fist, and I suddenly realized that he was now standing in the Lilac Room.
 "Spread out and find her."

It was like the howl from my dream was echoing through my soul.
 "Did he say what it was like?
 The predator, I mean."
 Britney nodded slowly.
 "Yeah, he thought it was somehow related to a wolf, but bigger and stronger, with claws like something out of a slasher movie.
 He was causing such a stir in St. George they finally fired him.
 They said he was sensationalizing the attack to get his fifteen minutes of fame.
 Daddy tried to get access to the bodies, to provide a second opinion even though that isn't his real area of expertise, but they blocked him cold.
 He thinks they were worried about scaring away the tourists.
 They had to make the accident go away, to save the local economy."

 In the parking lot, vendors sold oranges, onions, tapes and CDs in Spanish.
 I didn't see any Mother Teresa dolls, but I was half asleep.
 At 6:30 the church was crowded, standing room only.
 I found a place against the west wall near the front section, where the seats were reserved for MC sisters in their white saris.
 They are mostly small brown women with eyes so bright, at first glance they could pass for children.
 Up front, across from me was a small choir accompanied by a guitar and electric keyboard.
 They sang folk style hymns like ‚ÄúChange my heart oh God, make it ever new, change my heart oh God, make me be like you.‚Äù I leaned against the wall observing the congregation, vaguely aware that my heart sorely needed to change, since that morning my pastime was criticism.
 I grumbled inaudibly at the people who crowded, trying to position themselves for a clear view of Mother Teresa's approach.
 I disdained the TV camera bearers who nudged the rest of us aside as if the front row was their birthright.

 Our talk drifts from the varieties of modern Quakers to the benefits and hazards of churches in general.
 That last topic becomes the lead-in to her story.
 No sooner has she begun the telling, than Curly wanders off.
 Later I'll notice her on a couch close by, reading a book, or maybe pretending while she keeps watch over her friend, who no doubt is considered wacky by many, for reasons her story will clarify.
 A few years ago, she began to feel that something evil was inside her.
 ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt demonic,‚Äù she assures me.
 And it isn‚Äôt any part of her basic nature, she believes.
 Over some months, through prayer and meditation, she came to believe that evil itself had invaded the world and entered people, and God had allowed this to happen, which led her to a certainty that we are now living in the world‚Äôs final days.

He turned back to his questioner, his mouth a grimace as the words came out, unmistakably a curse, and his other arm was wrenched from its place as well.
 He winced, apparently not yet numb from the damages, and then his face went hard, his lips pressed together, jaw clenched tight.
 He wasn‚Äôt going to scream.
 Or talk.
 His back twisted and he fell, a motionless heap on the ground.
 His body was bent out of recognition.
 It was over.
 My ears had stopped ringing the moment he‚Äôd hit the ground.
 Ruby relaxed and stepped away from me.
 I wanted to catch up with what had happened but no one was talking, the mountain was silent.

Meanwhile, advanced computer, satellite and communications technology should be made available to the Secretariat by member states.
 A comprehensive system is needed to monitor military movements.
 Through its resident representatives, the UN should openly monitor political, ethnic, nationalist and religious developments that increasingly lie at the heart of conflicts in order to understand the complexities of local events and to anticipate potential turbulence.
 The right to sovereignty should not include the freedom to privacy in cases which involve support for terrorist groups, instigating border conflicts, arms build-ups, torture and genocide.
 In addition to the role of the UN in consensus fact-finding, it must also acquire the jurisdiction to order fact-finding missions relating to both domestic and regional conflicts in which this type of violation is suspected.
 Cessation of violence and conflict settlement often leave unresolved the root causes of conflict, resulting in potential for renewed fighting or social turbulence.
 Peace-building activities should address underlying economic and social factors that prevent the establishment of a stable and secure peace.
 In instances such as Cambodia, Rwanda and Somalia, the vacuum created by the complete collapse of political and economic institutions necessitates a broader role for the UN in re-establishing the peace.
 Peace building has thus far been defined as post-conflict actions to support reconstruction and to strengthen and solidify peace.
 The concept needs to be broadened to include pre-conflict actions and expanded to encompass a wider array of potentially destabilizing factors that lead to conflicts.

There was Junnie, her blonde hair shining in the sun as she greeted me at her door on the west side of the village.
 And Junnie, mysterious under a hooded cloak, fighting with magic and weaponry, killing members of the council guard.
 We sat around a fire, telling stories.
 Someone was ribbing Ruby.
 Her eyes narrowed when she replied to him, matter-of-factly, ‚ÄúYour mouth is very small.
 It‚Äôs unattractive.‚Äù And her head bobbed side to side as she smiled, pleased with herself.
 Anvil laughed and his tongue wagged.
 He was holding someone by the arm, preventing them from running away.
 Suddenly, my vision changed and I was a hawk, attacking, tearing a piece from his tongue.

 I hold it out to him, he takes it from me and turns it off, and he says, ‚ÄúWe got them.‚Äù I am so relieved but that is only one answer to one question and I have many.
 The deal was done and I was so relieved that it was over.
 I then called my wife who was so wound up from the lack of communication over such a long period of time.
 She sobbed uncontrollably as I told her I was unharmed, headed home, the ordeal was over and we busted the drug dealers.
 A hero‚Äôs welcome awaited me, as my son was so thankful for what I had done for him.
 As I went to bed that night, my mind would not shut off and the events of that evening replayed in my head over and over again.
 I lay awake for hours wondering what would have happened if the dealer hadn‚Äôt run into the cops.
 They both confessed to the drug deal when separately interrogated.
 The officer said they had less than half of the money, which she had attempted to hide in a trash can in the Starbucks‚Äô bathroom, and Steve had a gun, which Ashley admitted they would have used if I didn‚Äôt give them the drugs once I discovered they were short on cash.

Unless UN member states invest international institutions with the necessary authority and meet their financial commitments to support them, the world will continue to drift and flounder, powerless to oppose petty dictators and ruthless aggression.
 Unless a cooperative world military force comes into existence, every country will continue to be burdened with the enormous expense and insecurity characteristic of the old system.
 Perhaps more than any other institution, the military has under stood and demonstrated the enormous power of organization to accomplish a goal.
 The Gulf War was a dramatic illustration of the importance of reliable information, perfect planning, logistical support systems, effective chains of command and swift responsiveness to changing situations.
 If humankind could mobilize and apply the same efficiency to the war on poverty and unemployment that it has exhibited in preparing for and waging military wars against each other, very soon there would be no more poverty or unemployment to fight.
 During the Second World War Ford Motors converted from manufacture of cars for the masses to making trucks and airplanes for the military, producing B-24 bombers at the rate of one per hour from a single production plant.
 If conversion from civilian to military production could be carried out by so many countries within one or two years, it must be possible to convert the military from war-based to peace-based applications, and defence industries from military to civilian production, within half a decade.
 That requires human resourcefulness in organizational innovation.
 Organization is the means by which people work together cooperatively to achieve common goals and, in the process, to serve society in a wide range of functions.
 The achievement of food security and full employment depends on the establishment of new types of public and private organizations ‚Äì commercial, financial, industrial, export, research, educational and training.

Jason flicked some knives into his wrist and flung them at the creature.
 Some hit their mark, which was signaled by the creature roaring out in pain, others fell into the dirt.
 Emily danced close to it, spinning fire from her fingertips.
 The creature raised a leg and swatted at her but she just twirled away.
 The stinger narrowly missed Seth, and I saw him stumble back in surprise.
 He swung his sword at the stinger.
 It sliced through and the creature screeched so loud I was afraid everyone would hear it.
 The stinger fell on the ground and dark blood oozed from the cut.
 ‚ÄúNow Jazell!‚Äù Seth yelled to me.
 I notched an arrow and took aim at the thrashing belly.

In all the ways that mattered Rodregas knew he was no better than this man, he had spent most of his life as a slaver.
 Rodregas had no moral grounds on which to kill these men, but inside of him there was no mercy.
 He had crossed a line and could no longer live with the evil.
 Rodregas let go of the guard‚Äôs shield.
 He did not have the angle to grab his opponent‚Äôs throat.
 Instead he had to grab the man‚Äôs lower face which was exposed by the half helm, and then he squeezed.
 Rodregas felt the guard‚Äôs face give way to his rage and unnatural strength.
 For a moment the guard struggled to escape his hold, but Rodregas pulled him closer with one hand and with the other ripped his opponent‚Äôs face away.
 Rodregas felt a stab in his back as he took either an arrow or a sword.
 He was groggy with pain, and both weak and filled with rage.

 As she wandered off, Rick focused his mind on the TV shows they'd watched last night.
 He replayed all the details of the plots, being sure that he saw, in his mind's eye, all the colors.
 Then he began thinking about planes, remembering his trip with Marie to Los Angeles.
 Then he thought about all the computer programs he used and how to troubleshoot them.
 He'd just started listing microwave products in his mind when Marie returned.

 After traveling the world and witnessing racial tensions rising all around, Billy Graham had grown ever more certain that the only solution was at the foot of the cross.
 He said the foot of the cross was the only place where in every sense all of us are equals.
 We‚Äôre all sinners, he said, and we‚Äôre sinners by choice.
 We choose to break God's moral laws.
 We become drunkards or fornicators, selfish, consumed with pride and prejudice and intolerance.
 But the sinful heart can‚Äôt find happiness.
 And God, he assured us, wants his creatures to get happy, which is why Christ said we must be born again, so he could give us new moral natures, new affections, new objectives, and new directions.
 What planted the hook in me was: according to Billy Graham, when you make your decision for Christ, you do it for the sake of the nation and the world.
 Without God, any nation will perish.

We still didn't have a phone, and probably wouldn't for weeks to come, even assuming we somehow managed to keep our home through the end of the week.
 Calling Mom and asking her to come and get me was out.
 Presumably if I waited long enough Mom would decide something was wrong and come looking for me.
 Unless she was out hiking somewhere, in which case it might be a day or two before she realized I was missing.
 There was nothing to do but walk.
 I waited a few minutes to give Britney time to get out of the lab, and then walked in and grabbed my things.
 The other kids were already clearing out.
 Nobody even looked up as I left.
 Luckily I'd worn sneakers rather than the exotic footwear most girls gravitated towards.
 If I'd been wearing anything else, I'd have been nursing blisters before I made it out of the parking lot.

"I didn't realize Alec had talked to anyone about me.
 Actually I think you just let more drop in a few sentences than he's told me all week.
 Alec claims it's because I could be put in danger just by knowing certain things, but I think he's still just not quite sure he can trust me."
 Mallory slowly leaned back in her chair, and then shook her head.
 "No, it isn't because he doesn't trust you.
 If he didn't trust you, he wouldn't have brought you here.
 He'd trust Isaac or Jasmin with his or even Rachel's life, but neither of them know about me.
 In fact, bringing you here expands the circle of people who know about me to a grand total of three.
 He trusts you, more than just trusts you, but he's right.
 There are a number of things you shouldn't know just yet."

It must have been obvious, because when he excused himself to check the herd, Chevelle studied me, sliding a strand of my now-black hair through his fingers.
 ‚ÄúIt suits you.‚Äù It was a familiar gesture and it should have made me flinch.
 Maybe it was the wine, but as I looked at him, my anger was fading.
 The way he‚Äôd reacted when Fannie had struck me, the caress against my cheek, those were not the actions of a council elder.
 As we sat so near, it was hard to believe the concern wasn‚Äôt real.
 His eyes burned with intensity; they seemed even darker now.
 Dark‚Ä¶ like mine.
 I looked away.
 Steed broke in through the trees, gesturing toward the direction he‚Äôd come from.

 "That would be really great.

 Brandon ran one finger down the side of my face, and then leaned back with a smile as I reached for the door.
 It wasn't until I was out of the car that I realized our Jeep was parked in its normal spot off to the side of the house.
 Excited to talk to Mom about her last outing, I waved goodbye to Brandon and hurried to the door.
 Mom hardly even looked up from her laptop as I walked in.
 Whew, no need to go through the third degree about Brandon.

But I must have appeared about as threatening as a kitten, because the leg I was gripping shook with laughter.
 My angry gaze turned on my new acquaintance and he raised his hands in surrender, still chuckling.
 ‚ÄúI take it you know him?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs following me,‚Äù I announced, too loud.
 His eyes were concerned, so I let down my guard, moving to stand behind him.
 Chevelle approached us, staring directly at me as if there were not the broad, tall form of the stranger between us.
 He let me see his irritation for one long moment before his features melted back into their standard sternness.
 For some reason, it infuriated me, and I nearly berated him right there.
 But I remembered I was on the run.
 I remembered this strange elf in front of me.

My heart tripped at the sound of cracking tinder beneath boot across the clearing.
 The fire had burned out, but the ashes were plenty evidence I‚Äôd been here.
 I ducked under the cover of a large spruce and watched.
 Chevelle walked through the tree line and my jaw clenched tight against a silent curse.
 He was alone.
 He kept walking as he looked my direction, surveying the damage from the fire.
 I was convinced he would know it had been me, but he didn‚Äôt stop or even slow.
 It made no sense.
 Why hadn‚Äôt he investigated further?

Asia is expected to generate half the growth in gross world product and world trade during the 1990s.
 This region will have one billion consumers of televisions, refrigerators and motor vehicles by the year 2000 and a rising appetite for both imported consumer and capital goods.
 East Asia alone, excluding Japan and China, will spend about $900 billion on infrastructure between 1992 and 2000.
 During this decade, China and India will add 21,000 megawatts of electricity generation every year and more telephone switching capacity than the United States and Japan combined.
 Latin America‚Äôs annual requirements for investment in power, water and sewage, telecommunications and transport infrastructure are estimated at $60 billion.
 Rising incomes and increasing exports to the dynamic economies of Asia and Latin America could generate as many as 1.7 million jobs by the end of the decade in the United States alone.
 The growth of the developing economies could provide the major impetus for economic expansion and job creation in both developed and developing countries.
 Government policies based on recognition of this fact can considerably improve the climate for development of these nations and correspondingly stimulate further growth in the West.
 Freer international trade will generate a flood of cheaper goods from the developing world that will give rise not only to greater purchasing power and higher standards of living for the Western consumer, but also to a ‚Äòdemand boom‚Äô for sophis ticated Western goods and services to improve infrastructure and meet the needs of billions of consumers in developing countries.
 The vast inequalities in living standards that persist within both developing and industrial nations, and between the most and least economically developed countries, result in an enormous global loss of incomes and jobs.

Then Jasmin said she didn't believe Lucy was sorry, and that she'd kill her if Lucy didn't stay away from him."
 Brandon nodded slowly.
 "The boy's name's Ben.
 I'm not sure why she's fixated on him the way she has, or why she views Lucy as such a deadly threat to her chances with him, but it's essentially that simple."
 I felt like my head should be reeling from the sheer stupidity.
 Even in a town this small, it didn't seem like the competition for the available males should be a matter for death threats.
 Brandon took my head shaking as denial of what he'd said, rather than disbelief regarding the situation.
 "I promise that every word I just told you is true.
 More importantly, I promise I'll make sure nothing terrible happens to you."
 Looking into Brandon's caring eyes, I almost couldn't believe any of it.

When I went too deep she was quick to pull the plug.
 I still stay awake nights reliving the ignominy, forgetting to celebrate how we came together briefly, fiery angels.

 It‚Äôs all silly, of course, but that‚Äôs what everyone was doing.

She didn't sleep well that night but woke up early nevertheless.
 After bathing, she put on her emerald underwear and a simple white dress and went out into the garden.
 It didn't look so different from Rick's, she decided.
 They didn't have any white roses like he did, nor an electric fountain, but they had red roses and azaleas, just as he did.
 She wished she'd brought back a picture of him.
 But a picture wouldn't help much, she knew.
 She wanted to be in his arms, kiss him, touch him.
 She wanted to lie in his arms as she had their last night together.
 She wanted to make love with him and fall asleep with him and wake up with him.
 Sounds of breakfast preparations brought her out of her reverie, and she realized she'd been crying.

 All of the impending skin cancer deaths suddenly didn't seem quite so important.
 I looked away before anyone could see me staring.
 Britney was still looking longingly at a pile of fries.
 When I looked up again Brandon was looking back at me with a smile that communicated all kinds of things I'd always thought you needed words for.
 His expression seemed to say he was glad to see me, embarrassed to be the center of attention, and sorry he couldn't get away from his friends to come over and say hi.
 I felt my face go hot with embarrassment.
 I tried to step behind a pillar before he saw me go bright red, but knew I hadn't succeeded.
 I bit my lip as I realized how spastic I was being.

A shower of sparks lit up the night as the second wolf dodged away from my defender, and then impossibly the first wolf was back and darting in as I heard jaws snap shut on something.
 The black shadow staggered back, nearly falling under the combined weight of its two opponents.
 A second later another yelp was cut short as one of the wolves fell away to lie motionless on the ground.
 My head was throbbing so bad I blacked out for a moment, and missed the end of the fight.
 When I opened my eyes back up, the indistinct shadow was moving smoothly towards me.
 I opened my mouth to thank him, and then felt as though my world had been pulled out from underneath me.
 The shadow went from my savior to a nightmarish being.
 It was easily eight feet tall, covered in thick fur, and had bloody claws as long as my hands tipping the ends of its fingers.
 My vision was still swimming enough that I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing.
 Even so, there was no way to ignore the bloodstained mouth as it got closer.

Rodregas had thought that Jorin was a good lad, well behaved and bright, and his eyes were eager for signs of hope.
 Rodregas brought him extra food and words of reassurance.
 Ravenhurr had no need for him nor his mother, and he had seen other prisoners who were not of use set free.
 Rodregas had thought that Jorin would also be set free.
 Two months went by and Rodregas had developed a strong fondness for the boy; a few of the guards made jokes that Rodregas had a new pet.
 Rodregas was used to the rough humor of soldiers and let such jokes roll off.
 The night came when the father was taken for the ceremony.
 Rodregas was on guard duty when Korin came down in his new body.
 The poor lad had stared at the man who had been his father, saying nothing, but tears ran down his cheeks.
 The apprentice Immortalist had then proceeded to rape the mother.

Plucking one of the magenta blossoms, she raised it to her nose as she continued her stroll and her thoughts.
 She loved being held.
 Last night was the first time he'd held her except when they were dancing and during their brief kisses.
 And she'd had to trick him into it.
 Didn't he like holding her?
 That was a silly idea‚Äîhe loved her.
 And he certainly liked kissing her.
 Marie frowned.

Still, because Eric didn‚Äôt create himself, to worship him would be like praising Hamlet rather than Shakespeare.
 Besides, if Eric died for me, it probably wasn‚Äôt the human in him, but the Christ.
 So I will take care not to worship Eric, only adore him.
 I wonder if I have been stricken by acute anthropomorphism.
 Maybe I should give up watching my Joan of Arcadia CD collection.

But her heart began pounding with panic as she thought about the day she'd just spent in 2011.
 She'd worn trousers in town, and she'd embraced a man in public.
 And now she was spending the night alone with him in his house!
 Davis would have a fit if he ever found out she'd been to a speakeasy; he'd refuse to marry her if he found out what she'd done today.
 But there was no way he could find out.
 Tomorrow she'd be back home, and he'd be ecstatic that she was all right.
 He'd be sorry he'd lost his temper with her and hurt her with his kiss.
 He'd spend more time with her.

Launch a nationwide public educational programme on the tremendous potential gains in productivity from increased training.
 Support initiatives by providing incentives to intensify training programmes for all employees by every type of commercial and non-commercial institution in order systemati cally to upgrade the technical, vocational, organizational and managerial skills of the workforce.
 10.School-to-work apprenticeship programmes: The transition from school or college to work can be long and difficult.
 Germany's apprenticeship programme equips nearly 70 per cent of all teenagers with employable skills before they enter the workforce.
 Two-thirds of the UK workforce have no vocational or professional qualification, compared with only 25 per cent in Germany.
 There is growing support in the United States for establishment of a national youth apprenticeship training programme that combines classroom schooling with on-the-job skills training to ensure a smooth transition to employment for those who do not pursue higher education.
 11.Link demilitarization to urban employment: The military possesses both the expertise and the physical infrastructure for training large numbers of people in a wide range of technical, vocational and social skills.
 Building upon success ful US Defence Department programmes that re-deploy soldiers to assist troubled inner city youth, closed military bases can be converted into large training centres operated by military teaching staff for instructing and housing urban unemployed youth during an apprenticeship period.
 12.Promote integrated urban development programmes: The Atlanta Project is a bold attempt to evolve a new type of organization to address the problems of inner city poverty and unemployment.
 The inner city of Atlanta, Georgia, has been divided into clusters in which members of the local community work closely with the staff of major corporations, voluntary agencies, religious groups and a wide range of government agencies to identify and promote employment opportunities and other poverty-alleviation activities.

3.Upgrade skills: Absorbing new technology, raising productivity, improving the quality and competitiveness of exports ‚Äì all depend on the skills of the workforce.
 Labour productivity has been increasing in East Asia by 10 per cent a year, half of which is attributable to investment in education and technical skills.
 Training institutions and programmes in most developing countries provide only a narrow range and low level of skill acquisition to a small portion of the population.
 Raise skills to increase productivity by vastly expanding the lower tiers of the agricultural, craft, technical and vocational training systems at the local level to provide practical training in job-related skills to the saturation point.
 Imbalances between supply and demand for skills exist at all levels in developing economies.
 Make a careful assessment of present supply and demand for key skills.
 Compare the density of different types and levels of skill in countries at the next higher stage of development and evolve programmes to raise the quantity and quality of skills to that level.
 4.Improve marketing: The organization of marketing is typically one of the weakest links and, therefore, one of the greatest barriers to economic growth and job growth.
 Brazil set up a distribution system for the export of citrus fruits that has enabled it to become the world's largest exporter of this commodity.
 Improve distribution and marketing systems, especially for agricultural produce, by identifying missing links and establishing successful model programmes that bridge the gap between rural producers and urban or overseas markets.

 Harruq trembled, indeed feeling that anger.
 He felt it deep inside his chest, urging him to rise and defy Velixar.

Turns out, just because I did drugs and knew people who were addicted to drugs I was still not qualified to understand how to break someone from craving the drugs that satisfy their addiction.
 Brandon seemed better and we thought we had helped him simply because we incarcerated him at home away from his peers until he had the drugs out of his system.
 In our mind, he was cured.
 Unfortunately, the problem had not been solved so easily.
 Like any good movie, this solution came too easily and too early in the drama.
 He was such a child then, easily influenced and dealing with challenges in counterproductive ways.
 He was caught being truant, being out past curfew, being with a kid who stole a wallet.
 He was involved in multiple car accidents.
 Brandon struggled and was barely making it through high school, so we changed him to a problem-child school to enable him to graduate.
 He and his younger brother Bryce were growing apart just as I had grown apart from my brother Thomas, which was torturous for me and Lisa to watch.

When I need a break from work or chores, and sometimes while reading or praying, I sit on the back porch like my mom used to do.
 The view was the reason she gave for not selling the house after I left home.
 As I sit and gaze toward the Mexican border, I think of Eric, and how we used to peer through twilight and try to locate his home in the valley about five miles closer to Mexico.
 Which reminds me of Sylvia and how the cruelty of the world drove her crazy, and I wonder if turning to Jesus might have cured her, if she had let him expel her bitterness.
 Because for those who fail to discover peace and even joy in the midst of the cruelty, going mad is only sensible.
 I imagine Eric sitting beside me, wearing the same face as after he pinned me to his living room floor, just before he coached me to believe in myself no matter the evidence that I was a loser.
 Then the expression changes to the one I imagine him wearing when he told Kenny they needed to leave for the desert without Billy and me.
 I get a crazy idea I have never considered before.
 Because Eric and Olga would have loved each other, I bring Olga out of the air and onto the lounge chair beside Eric.

UN and other studies estimate that Europe would have to accept 150 million new immigrants over the next 25 years in order to maintain the present levels of working population and Japan would need to admit 600,000 immigrants annually for the next 50 years in order to maintain the size of its working population at the 1995 level.
 The US labour force is projected to stop growing by 2013.
 These findings support the view of the India Vision 2020 report that ‚ÄúThis trend will further accelerate the outsourcing of production of goods and services to locations where infrastructure, ease of doing business, quality, costs and availability of labour are most attractive, which will be beneficial for many labour surplus countries like India.‚Äù
 Expanding World Trade: Trade is playing an increasing role in the economic growth of developing countries.
 Economic integration with the global economy has become a compelling necessity for every country.
 The share of trade in global GDP rose from 12 per cent in 1970 to 29 per cent in 2001.
 While the effects of expanding world trade on employment are complex and can lead to displacement of workers and destruction of jobs in some cases, available evidence strongly indicates that the overall impact of freer trade on the global economy will be to promote significantly faster growth of employment opportunities.
 The emerging liberalization of textile trade in 2005 is an example of the potential positive impact of freer trade.
 In India the textile industry provides employment to 18 per cent of the entire workforce, accounts for 8 per cent of the country's GDP, 17 per cent of its manufacturing capacity, and 27 per cent of its export earnings.
 A recent projection indicates that with the lifting of quotas under the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing in January 2005, India‚Äôs textile exports could rise from the current $16 billion to $40 billion by 2010, creating as many as 12 million new jobs in the process, five million jobs through direct employment in the textile industry and another seven million jobs in allied sectors.

Probably the water revived me.
 As Eric helped me out, I got more cheers than he had.
 Later he would explain I had made a neat flip while careening into the pool.
 He led me inside, wetted a washcloth and dabbed the wound on my forehead until I faded.
 I awoke on the outskirts of heaven, gazing across a chasm at the enchanted forest.
 The air resonated with music, clean and simple melodies, at once ardent, tender and joyful.
 Maybe it was a dream.
 Or a premonition.
 Or, for all I know, I might have briefly died.
 The spell broke and left me sprawled in the Desert Inn.

We do not advocate a return to state socialism or expansion of the public sector.
 As in the case of the environment, the changes needed are in the priority given to achieving different social objectives in the formulation of government policy.
 Recommendations to Achieve Full Employment in Industrial Nations
 Earlier we noted long-term trends that suggest the recent rise in unemployment in the West does not necessarily forebode, and need not necessarily result in, chronically higher rates of unemployment in these countries.
 Granted that the necessary political and social commitment is forthcoming, there are a range of strategies which, taken in the proper measure and combination, can dramatically accelerate job growth and reduce unemployment.
 Each of these strategies has proved effective in stimulating employment, though none by itself may be sufficient to solve the problem.
 A comprehensive, total approach, rather than partial and half-way measures, is needed.
 No industrial country can claim that it systematically exploits all the potential benefits of the strategies in this list.
 This should be the highest priority of every Western government today.

I felt tears collecting in the corners of my eyes as I reached out and touched the nearest tree.
 It was as if the world I'd known my entire life had been simply a moldy cover designed to hide the true nature of my surroundings.
 Now the mask was gone and I was immersed in vivid colors, living lights, and a sense of harmony so strong it nearly overwhelmed me.
 It was impossible to say for certain how long I sat looking at the gentle motion of the tree branches, marveling at the way things made up of light could still cast shadows when silhouetted by the harsher light of the sun.
 Only somehow the sun had disappeared, replaced by the paler, colder light of the moon.
 The trees were still graceful strands of light, but the breeze had changed to a harsh thing, one carrying new scents that somehow represented danger.
 Something inside me forced my limbs into motion.
 I was running before the first howl tore through the night.
 I was moving unimaginably fast, jumping fallen trees and bounding over other obstacles which even my improved vision struggled to make out in time for me to avoid them.
 The speed of my passage wrung tears from my eyes, but I didn't dare slow.

Alec's voice was huskier than normal, but still carried most of its velvety perfection.
 As I looked at him, I realized I wasn't feeling any power arcing from him.
 Everything centered on him now, but he wasn't adding to the storm.
 The wolves behind Brandon growled as Alec stepped forward.
 "Ah, and here I'd thought you'd once again settled on a course of appeasement."
 Brandon's features were hollow, almost skeletal in the harsh chemical light.
 "No.
 We've come for one purpose and one only.
 No more murdered hikers, no more convenient accidents.

Emily raised her hands and vines shot from the ground and wrapped around a troll that had tried to crush Seth.
 I aimed an arrow at its chest and the troll fell to the ground next to the others.
 The last beast fell, dead from Jason's knife, and we all took in a deep breath.
 Seth sheathed his sword and I slung my bow back on my back.
 Emily sat on the ground next to Jason, Seth and me as the dwarf stood in front of us.
 ‚ÄúSadly,‚Äù he started, ‚ÄúI cannot be with you all anymore.

All that time with nothing to do but talk, and once you started talking to people they wanted to know things.
 Things that weren't any of their business, things you weren't ready to discuss.
 Somehow I knew Rachel wouldn't pry.
 It was like keeping so many secrets for her brother had made her especially sensitive to other people's secrets.
 Another few steps brought us to the door, and I held it open for Rachel to follow me outside.
 The intense heat felt like a physical blow.
 I could almost feel my pores open up in an effort to keep me from overheating.
 The sensory overload as my eyes tried to adjust to the unfiltered afternoon sun momentarily distracted me.
 It wasn't until I heard the other door swing shut that I realized James had followed us through, but he'd taken the door on the right instead of the one of the left that I'd been holding open for him.
 Wow, talk about a chauvinistic pig.

 Finally the crew is all present behind the store, and the review of protocol and procedure began as it did before.
 New officers are in amongst familiar faces from the prior attempt.
 I find myself less interested in their chat as I mentally prepare myself for the task at hand.

In 1993 alone, consumer prices rose by more than 100 per cent in 15 countries, out of which 11 former republics of the USSR reported increases of more than 300 per cent.
 This was accompanied by a sharp rise in unemployment from extremely low historical levels prior to 1989 up to an average of 17 per cent in 1994.
 The tremendous physical and psychological stress experienced by people in the region as a result of the economic collapse is reflected in the sharp fall in birth rates and the steep rise in death rates.
 Since 1989, the birth rate has fallen by more than 20 per cent in Poland, 25 per cent in Bulgaria, 30 per cent in Estonia and Romania, 35 per cent in Russia and more than 60 per cent in Eastern Germany.
 Such abrupt changes have been observed previously in industrial societies only during times of war.
 Infant mortality is rising in many of the countries.
 Not surprisingly, there have been increasing indications of public discontent and voter dissatisfaction with the course of the reforms in the vast majority of countries.
 Simultaneous Shocks
 The collapse of the East European and Central Asian economies from 1990 to 1994 resulted from their exposure to a series of simultaneous shocks.
 1.Stabilization and adjustments: The majority of countries, having suffered from inflation and balance of payments problems in the 1980s, applied sharp stabilization and adjustment programmes in the early 1990s to stop inflation, balance budgets, and close balance of payments gaps, while at the same time liberalizing prices in order to correct major price distortions.

"Hello?"
 "Adri, honey, are you sure this is a good idea?
 I haven't gotten on the charter plane yet, there's still time to call this off if you're uneasy about being alone for so long."
 The last place I wanted her right now was home though, so it was easier than normal to lie.
 "Mom, this is the chance of a lifetime.
 Don't worry about me, I'll be fine."
 There was a long pause as her dreams warred with normal maternal instincts.
 I could hear a plane start up in the background by the time she finally responded.
 "Okay, honey.
 If you're sure, then we'll do it, but if anything comes up just call me.

A spark lit at the hem of my left sleeve and slowly worked its way up my arm.
 I wanted the fire off me, needed it put out.
 When I concentrated on that, the flame flickered.
 It flared again and Chevelle squeezed my hands; I had to be able to do this.
 I focused hard on the base of the flame as it wavered and then fell back toward the hem, where it finally choked off.
 I glanced up at Chevelle.
 He looked pleased.
 ‚ÄúAgain,‚Äù he said as he stepped back and released my hands.
 The meadow seemed to open as a circle of fire grew in front of me.
 I tried to see past it, through the flames to Chevelle, and then it was gone.

"I demand satisfaction on behalf of my pack for the two of our number that you brutally murdered.
 This is within my rights under the laws that bind us.
 I demand two lives for the two lives robbed me."
 Brandon's expression was confident and a little smug, and I somehow didn't doubt in the slightest that he'd expected Alec to calmly hand over two people to be executed.
 Alec hadn't even flinched at the demand.
 "Your wolves were lawbreakers who were executed before they could break further laws.
 The protection of the people, of the secrets that guard our nature from the dayborn, represents a law that supersedes any question of territory or dominance."
 The energy suddenly rolling off of the gathered shape shifters nearly drove me to my knees as Alec continued.
 "By their actions Adriana Paige learned of our nature, and it was only by the grace of the Maker that I was able to stop them from killing her.
 Their deaths were an unavoidable price to save an innocent."

When I finally caught up with her she'd recovered enough to complain, but there was a breathless nature to her voice that told me she wouldn't be skipping the math lab for a little while.
 I made non-committal noises as we waited in line, all the while scanning the cafeteria for two faces.
 Actually, scanning wasn't the right word for it.
 I just kind of looked that way and instantly found my eyes drawn to Brandon.
 He was surrounded by people, mostly female, all attractive.
 Taking in all of those lithe, tan bodies, I suddenly felt incredibly inferior.
 All of the impending skin cancer deaths suddenly didn't seem quite so important.
 I looked away before anyone could see me staring.
 Britney was still looking longingly at a pile of fries.
 When I looked up again Brandon was looking back at me with a smile that communicated all kinds of things I'd always thought you needed words for.

He desperately hoped none would spot him.
 He reached a large stinking corpse lying on its back with a golden arrow in its forehead.
 Qurrah shoved the cadaver onto its side, curled underneath, and then let it fall atop him.
 The weight crushed his fragile body and the smell was awful, but it was his only cover.
 Miserable, he hid there, quietly whispering.
 ‚ÄúWhere are you, Harruq?‚Äù he said, his face buried into the dirt.
 His tears fell to the grass.
 ‚ÄúHarruq, I need you.
 Where are you?‚Äù
 Then he heard talking and shut his mouth.

 Seth stared stone faced at Kojas as he slowly walked towards us.
 With every step, Seth‚Äôs hand inched closer to his sword.
 Emily cracked her knuckles quietly and held them stiff at her sides.
 Her face was determined, but I saw her eyes flicker.
 Jason flicked out his knives and held them so tightly that his knuckles were white.
 If he gripped any harder, I was afraid he would snap his fingers off.
 And, me?

The subjects all blurred together as the hours passed by in a blur of academic exhaustion.
 I wanted to go to sleep long before dark, but couldn't justify it, so I just kept grinding along.
 I'd long ago learned that changing subjects and studying something new was almost as good as a break, so I swapped out books on a regular basis, and persevered despite increasingly-frequent head bobs.
 The attack came as a complete surprise.
 One moment I was quietly studying, an instant later hordes of shape shifters were pouring into the mansion.
 Most of them looked just like Simon and Nathanial, pony-sized wolves moving with blinding speed as they tore through doors and raced down halls.
 Brandon came in immediately behind the first batch of wolves.
 There was no way I could've known that the gray monster who casually sliced through walls and two-by-fours with his wickedly curved claws was Brandon, but I was somehow certain.
 He was built just like Alec had been Friday night, only so much bigger that he had to crouch forward to avoid hitting his head on the unusually high ceilings.
 Donovan faced off against one of the first wolves, but it was obvious he was no match for the grace and power of his opponent.

But no one was coming.
 I was na√Øve to think they would chase me like hounds on a fox.
 They had magic‚Äîthey were High Council.
 I stayed in the patch of briars for most of the day, cowering despite myself, but as the sun lowered in the sky, I crawled out on my belly to start the long walk toward home.
 It was late by the time I reached the tree and I was tired enough I didn‚Äôt care as much about being caught.
 I didn‚Äôt even know if they knew who broke the seal, if they knew I was the guilty party.
 But I was still quiet as I entered the house, then my room, and slid into bed.
 The next morning I slipped out early to call on Junnie.
 When I reached her door, it was cracked open again.
 I pushed it aside and scanned the front room, to no avail.

Alec carefully lifted me into his arms before I took more than two or three hops.
 Jasmin had her cell phone out before she'd even made it to the stairs, and the sound of a massive engine under hard acceleration heralded the arrival of our limo.
 I leaned back in my seat as everyone else settled into their spots.
 Alec pulled out his pocket square and used it to dab away my tears.
 "I'm sorry.
 I didn't mean to set you down so hard."
 Jasmin interrupted before I could say anything.
 "Any slower and you'd have been cut off from the rest of us by those mutts."
 My confusion must have been obvious.

"Of course, you've got the right answers, and technically you're attacking the problems correctly, but you're leaving out a couple of steps that I think will give you problems a bit later on.
 Please take my advice and spend a little bit of time at the math lab.
 Even if you can't make it every day, you need to come in a few times a week."
 "Yes, ma'am."
 The scolding actually hadn't been that bad, almost like disguised praise.
 Britney looked like she was hoping for something similar, but Mrs. Campbell's expression quickly dashed that idea.
 "You on the other hand definitely need to spend every night at the math lab.
 Your homework was incomplete, and of the problems you bothered to attempt, you didn't do a single one correctly.
 Britney, you're headed towards a failing grade, and while you might not care, your father most certainly does.

 I'd only ever seen him with a serious, if respectful expression.
 Even Rachel's frequent teasing hadn't ever managed to crack his 'working face'.
 "I hardly think that would be the case.
 While you may very well have lost your way, it would have been a small matter for one of the others to track you down.
 You have, if I may say so, a very distinctive smell.
 It reminds me of a type of sage brush that hasn't grown here in quite some time."
 His sigh was more felt than heard, and it put me in mind of mountains, redwoods, and other ancient things.
 "Donovan, can I ask you a question?"
 "Of course, mistress.

The arrow squirmed deeper.
 Qurrah focused every bit of his will upon it, desperately seeking to repulse it.
 His well of energy, which he‚Äôd thought empty, burgeoned and over-flowed.
 The arrow snapped, banishing the necromancer‚Äôs presence, but leaving a solitary impression squatting at the back of Qurrah‚Äôs mind:
 Curiosity.
 Qurrah opened his eyes.
 He lay on his back in his brother‚Äôs arms, yet he didn‚Äôt remember falling.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre alright!‚Äù Harruq hugged him.
 Qurrah laughed.
 ‚ÄúHe lost,‚Äù he said, pointing to the night sky.

 I knew the outcome if I didn‚Äôt, and I was already in trouble enough.
 Shortly after her tirade insisting I stay until I had earned permission to leave, the one-sided argument ran its course and Fannie tired of looking at me and sent me on my way.
 I trudged out of the kitchen, through the main sitting area, and into my room.
 It was dark except for a small beam of light from a knothole in the wall.
 Fire was the one magic I had mastered; I had been able to light lanterns and candles for as long as I could remember, but I didn‚Äôt bother.
 If I was in this room, I wanted to be alone.
 And in darkness I felt more so.

Meanwhile, advanced computer, satellite and communications technology should be made available to the Secretariat by member states.
 A comprehensive system is needed to monitor military movements.
 Through its resident representatives, the UN should openly monitor political, ethnic, nationalist and religious developments that increasingly lie at the heart of conflicts in order to understand the complexities of local events and to anticipate potential turbulence.
 The right to sovereignty should not include the freedom to privacy in cases which involve support for terrorist groups, instigating border conflicts, arms build-ups, torture and genocide.
 In addition to the role of the UN in consensus fact-finding, it must also acquire the jurisdiction to order fact-finding missions relating to both domestic and regional conflicts in which this type of violation is suspected.
 Cessation of violence and conflict settlement often leave unresolved the root causes of conflict, resulting in potential for renewed fighting or social turbulence.
 Peace-building activities should address underlying economic and social factors that prevent the establishment of a stable and secure peace.
 In instances such as Cambodia, Rwanda and Somalia, the vacuum created by the complete collapse of political and economic institutions necessitates a broader role for the UN in re-establishing the peace.
 Peace building has thus far been defined as post-conflict actions to support reconstruction and to strengthen and solidify peace.
 The concept needs to be broadened to include pre-conflict actions and expanded to encompass a wider array of potentially destabilizing factors that lead to conflicts.

Steed threw me a quick wink.
 Anvil approached next, stepping into the same starting position Grey had used, and Steed shifted several paces back before he readied himself and nodded toward his new opponent.
 I remembered the tree and was suddenly afraid for him.
 Would Anvil use the same method on a person?
 A thunderous crack answered my unspoken question.
 The lightning bolt was faster than my eyes at such a close distance, by the time I looked at Steed, there was nothing but a wall of water.
 He had constructed a barrier of sorts, caught the strike and redirected it around himself by melting the snow that spotted the mountain.
 Anvil was winded, though the strike wasn‚Äôt as severe as his previous show.
 Steed would unquestionably be the winner now and as he took aim to retaliate, his opponent raised his hands in surrender.

The teachers seemed curiously ignorant of everything.
 Nobody else seemed to think that was unusual, which freaked me out almost as much as Ben having nearly gone over the stairs.
 At least I didn't have to listen to all of the gossip during lunch.
 Once I'd been able to hobble down the stairs, I'd made my way to Mr. Whethers' room, and I'd spent the entire lunch break studying.
 I hadn't been especially excited at the prospect of spending that long by myself, but the cafeteria was all the way on the other side of the school.
 Limping over there listening to Vincent run his mouth and then coming all the way back here for History wouldn't be worth it.
 History being what it was, I probably heard about as much in that one hour as most everyone else did during the whole rest of the day.
 Mr. Simms seemed especially dense, and pretty much let everyone do whatever they wanted for the entire class.
 In deference to my new dedication to academic excellence, I finished up the reading, and then opened up my Biology book and started trying to get a handle on all of the items I'd thought I understood, but apparently hadn't.
 When the bell rang I limped back to my locker before making my painful way to Physics.

‚ÄúSee if somewhere else will take your mutt ass.‚Äù
 It was not just adrenaline that caused Harruq‚Äôs hands to shake, but Qurrah put his hand on his wrist and begged him to calm.
 ‚ÄúNever forget this shame,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúLet it burn in you.
 Let it be a reminder of what I have always said.
 We are better, superior.
 Never feel guilt at what we do to them, for you see what they would do to us.‚Äù
 Harruq stood, brushed some dirt from his pants, and then offered Qurrah a hand.
 Together they trudged west, without food, water, or blankets.
 The guards watched them go, smirking all the while.

 Harruq blushed.
 ‚ÄúNo need for lies,‚Äù he said.
 The elf laughed a little but said nothing.
 Instead, she walked over and gave Harruq a quick peck on the cheek.
 ‚ÄúKeep your big butt safe, okay?‚Äù she said.
 The half-orc tried to answer but his mouth refused to cooperate.
 Somehow, it seemed to have become unhinged.
 Besides, it wasn‚Äôt as if he could think of anything to say.
 All his mind could concentrate on was the feel of the elf‚Äôs soft lips on his cheek, the flowery scent of her perfume mixed with sweat, and the quick brush of her breasts against his arm.

 She burst into tears.
 Rick felt awful, but he didn't know if he felt worse for himself or for her.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he told her, scooting closer and putting his arms around her tentatively.
 When she didn't resist, he drew her closer.
 "I'm sorry.
 I wish I knew what to do to help you."
 "Stop being so nice to me," she sobbed into his shoulder.

The museums, the opera, the food.
 They were perfect gentlemen.
 On our way home, strung out on fatigue and more coffee, I babbled about how, guided by Kerouac, we had risen above routine, learned to outrun the sheep and phonies and to create our own destiny.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre well on our way to being Supermen,‚Äù I boasted.
 I prophesied that as soon as we got released from high school and were no longer branded juveniles, life would turn into a banquet.
 Eric mostly sat quiet.
 As we sped past the strawberry fields of Santa Maria, he said, ‚ÄúYou know what they say about there‚Äôs no free lunch?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù ‚ÄúSuppose they‚Äôre right.
 Then who‚Äôs going to pay for the banquet, for all this freedom?‚Äù

She gave him directions, trying not to notice how different all the houses in the neighborhood looked.
 "There--over there!

 She jumped out before he could stop completely and ran up to the front door.
 Rick dashed after her, grabbing her arm before she could open the door.
 "We'd better knock."
 "But this is my house."
 "Let's ring, just in case.

 Annoyed, she stood straight with eagerness as he pushed a button that she had never seen before.

I‚Äôd hit him‚Äîonce.
 But I intended to never hit my child.
 I had promised myself I would never, ever repeat this offense I had endured as a child.
 I just wanted to slap him out of it, to hurt him as we were hurting, because he seemed oblivious to the magnitude of our pain.
 It all happened so fast and when I realized that Brandon was bringing these drugs into our house, while we thought we were detoxing him, it was beyond me.
 I felt violated in so many ways, all at once and I snapped.
 Brandon‚Äôs nose was broken and my wife and sister-in-law attended to him to stop the bleeding and I sat in silent shock with Harry and Bryce flanking me on the couch‚Äî possible guards‚Äô against any further explosion into violence.
 There was no threat of that, as this intervention was over.
 Way over.
 The next day things had calmed down, and Brandon admitted to needing professional help, more than we could offer.

 I laughed as I remembered that was how I‚Äôd convinced him to stay, promising him protection.

 Eventually, one of the servants slipped, revealing they had seen me following my sister.
 And just like that, she was to blame for the entire ordeal, even though she‚Äôd never known.
 She‚Äôd been still searching the empty camp.
 At least I was off the hook.
 I surprised myself by being so slow.

Clutter, but, taken as a whole, it all made sense.

 Her three-headed dog.
 (laughs)  That was some dog, used to sit next to me and fix me with its glassy eye, just sit there for hours, man, and I‚Äôd end up thinking we were talking.
 I can still remember some of the conversations I had with that damned dog.
 It was black and tan, mostly black‚Äîwhat was it, a mix, part Rottweiler and part hellhound.

 Anyway, I spent a good half-hour just looking around, while she stood aside and observed me.
 I was spellbound, pixilated.

Having rejected the inadequacies and abuses of authoritarian socialism as a solution, we are compelled to find other methods to achieve social equity.
 In the present context, employment is the most effective way to distribute the fruits of development among people.
 The world is now capable of producing sufficient food and other basic necessities to feed, clothe and house everyone; but without opportunities for employment, people lack the purchasing power needed to buy them.
 Economic entitlement, rather than a shortage of food or food production capacity, is the key to global food security.
 Lack of employment opportunities is also directly linked to destruction of the environment, both rural and urban.
 The destruction of tropical rain forests has been one result.
 The greatest security challenges of the twenty-first century are economic, not military or political.
 Employment is a sine qua non for meeting these challenges.
 A thorough examination of facts and a dispassionate analysis reveal grounds for hope and opportunities for action.
 The possibility of more rapid economic growth and rising incomes in both developed and developing countries ‚Äì spurred by further substantial reduction in defence spending, the diffusion and application of new technologies, economic liberalization leading to growth of international trade, the globalization of financial markets, and the emergence of new engines for global expansion among developing countries ‚Äì indicates that our apprehensions need not prove justified, provided society acts courageously and decisively to meet the challenge.

As a senior guard familiar with the impending ceremony, the fellow damned well knew that neither prisoner would be worrying about food within the hour.
 Rodregas groaned to himself as the group picked up the pace on the tower steps.
 Over the last few years, his right knee acted up whenever he mounted stairs.
 That, of course, was just one of many complaints advanced years bestowed upon him.
 How ironic that the young prisoners were on their way to die, when old useless men like him, and scumbag fellow guards, continued to live.
 He suppressed a shiver of excitement at the notion that this time will be different.
 This time, he would not just cry out to the gods about the injustice while innocent people burned.
 He filled his lungs with stale air tainted with burning pitch and tried to sink into the mindless guard mentality that kept him functioning for the past decade and a half.
 Once a man loses all hope of a decent life, it is astonishing what he will do to stay alive.
 For the last twenty years his following orders and doing his duty, along with his better than average training for a guard, had served him well.

Apparently, it had been a real bohemian festival at some point, at least to the people who hung here.
 Everything was broken or ajar, apparently ransacked while Brandon was in jail.
 Nearly all of his belongings that were worth anything were stolen by the scumbags who had been his peers.
 We heard Brandon‚Äôs girlfriend, Tiffanie, was afraid to return to the house while our son was in jail and it was probably the smartest thing she had done in years.
 Brandon had accumulated flat screen TV‚Äôs, computers, stereo equipment, guns, you name it and it was all gone.
 Most of it, if not all of it was drug trade merchandise or purchased with drug sale money before his drug habit escalated to the point that his addiction was larger than he could support with his sales.
 The area under the rental house had been dug out and reinforced to grow indoor marijuana.
 It resembled an escape tunnel from a prison movie.
 None of this was intended for the eyes of a parent.

It takes material resources and technology to suppress people, not to make them free.
 That requires an acceptance of basic human rights as a non-negotiable minimum requirement for each nation to participate in the international community, which must start with a voluntary abdication by the great powers of the principle of rule by might that governs the present structure of the UN.
 Renunciation of the veto power, expansion of the Security Council and democratization of UN decision-making processes will forge an institution capable of meeting the challenges of the future, rather than living in the shadow of the past.
 Why should we wait for these things to happen inevitably after a lapse of decades or centuries when we are amply capable of attaining those beneficial results now, to the great advantage of everyone?
 Many will argue that, when it comes to food and jobs, the external resources are the real constraints.
 We disagree.
 It has been amply demonstrated that the main cause of famines is not inadequate production or supply of food.
 In the modern day, famine is primarily an economic problem of entitlement, not a physical problem of shortage.

‚ÄúSounds like a place that will be hard to find, but is this not territory infested with wild Dire beast?‚Äù ‚ÄúYup,‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚Äúanother reason I think this area is usually hard to find; most people stay clear.‚Äù He continued after a pause to let them think of entering territory known to be the hunting range of feared predators, ‚ÄúI never saw any sign of any Dire beast in the hollows when I was there, but, of course, they probably know of the place.
 Still, I would rather handle a pack of Hellhounds than The Immortal Guards.‚Äù Neither looked pleased at his logic, but both nodded.
 A few hours later it was starting to get dark as Rodregas recognized the spot and turned the wagon left for the final hard assent.
 At this point there was no trail, and common sense would have argued against the path.
 It was hard work.
 The horses had to be hand-led around rocks and trees and pulled up.
 Doi‚Äôvan and Rodregas had to manhandle the wagon around a few corners which was easier to do than it should have been, but Celestial and Hellborn strength together made short work of it.
 Then, as they finally started to level out into the small little valley of the hollow, the hair all over Rodregas‚Äô body suddenly stood up on end and his skin shivered.
 Rodregas was expecting it, but was a little shocked by the strength of his reaction.
 All those years ago he had had to struggle to feel it.

He stood up when he saw her, and she walked into his arms.
 "What do I need to do to get ready for Hollywood?"
 she asked, rubbing her cheek against his shoulder.
 She spent the day washing and ironing and folding clothes and cleaning the house.
 While the lasagna she'd made for dinner baked, she made a list of what she wanted to buy the next day.
 They needed new beach towels and more sunscreen and aloe vera lotion.
 She wanted a nice dress to wear in the evening, but she hesitated about putting it on the list.
 She didn't want to ask Rick for anything frivolous, and she'd probably get to wear the dress only once or twice.
 But she didn't want him to be embarrassed by a companion who wasn't dressed appropriately.
 Well, she'd ask him where he planned to take her and what she should wear.

"Yes please, Brandon can only take me home on Tuesdays and Thursdays."
 It wasn't my imagination; Isaac flinched slightly, and Rachel's smile momentarily turned plastic.
 I mentally kicked myself for having once again stepped squarely between the Capulets and Montagues.
 Isaac recovered with admirable speed, smiling as he gestured us forward.
 "Well, then, after you."
 It wasn't until Rachel and Isaac were driving away that I realized she'd completely pulled me out of my funk.
 I still didn't know that I could really depend on her, but at least I knew she'd try her hardest.
 Chapter 17 I reached out groggily to turn off my alarm, and then wished it was still the weekend so I wouldn't have to get up and go to school.
 I finished off my normal morning routine with a pair of aspirin from the bathroom cupboard.
 I didn't usually like taking drugs of any kind, but I had a sharp headache building already.

But he‚Äôd finally realized that there were worse things than being lonely.
 He wouldn‚Äôt have been lonely if he‚Äôd married Kim or Gina or Sabrina, but he wouldn‚Äôt have been happy.
 Even sex was no longer enough to motivate him to get into a relationship like those.
 He wanted someone he could be completely at ease with.
 He wanted someone he could relax with when he came home from work, not someone he had to work to please.
 All his married buddies told him he was dreaming, that marriage was a strain, a series of trade-offs.
 But he couldn‚Äôt help hoping there was something better than that.
 Or at least someone he could love so much that he wouldn‚Äôt even notice the trade-offs.
 Rick had planned to go to the office for a while the next morning, but his friend Dirk called to challenge him to a couple of games of racquetball.

It would do little good to get caught up in a one-on-one battle; the odds were too many against them.
 He had to use his new strength and speed and go after multiple targets.
 Rodregas focused on his breathing, he needed his body ready.
 He rested his body against the tree, trying not to tense up, and breathed deep and slow.
 Quicker than he thought, Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs black bow came up and he started to shoot.
 The Black Yew bows were an incredible advantage, they had been the pride of Raven Keep and were among the most dangerous and rare weapons that the Nymphs used to protect themselves.
 Those bows had primarily been ornamental trophies for Ravenhurr; Rodregas thought that they symbolized a previous victory.
 Only a few of the guards would have had the power to use them and Ravenhurr kept guards with even small power away from the keep.
 Against the leather armor of the slavers there would be no defense, even if they had shields; the arrows would likely blast through anything they had.
 Of course, against the Immortalist guards it was a different matter; their armor would stop the arrows.

"Yes, I understand.
 But--" "No.
 If I can't have Rick, I don't want anyone."
 She cried against her mother's shoulder until her tears were exhausted.
 Was Rick as miserable as she was, she wondered.
 Was he sorry he'd made it possible for her to go home?
 Was he wishing they'd made love?
 Did he sit for hours just as she did, paralyzed with misery and loneliness, constantly thinking about her as she was constantly thinking about him?
 "Why don't I get you some juice, darling?"
 "No, thank you."

Without pain, you will not reach your potential for quickness and reflexes.
 On the practice field such quickness means fewer bruises.
 On the battle field such reflexes means life and death.‚Äù Rodregas nodded, his words held the ring of truth, but he was not looking forward to days of practices and days full of bruises.
 The pattern of their days changed.
 Now after prayer and meditation came first the practice of the Kata, and then the staff and then finally the books.
 The true change came in the evening, the nights were full of such pleasure and joy such as Rodregas had seldom known in his life.
 The rest of summer passed as the most joyful that he had known, as the three started to the Kata and the staff.
 After the staff they moved to the bow where Imeralda became the master.
 To use the magical Black Yew bows required learning a spell to merging with the bow.
 The spell was unlike anything Rodregas had learned.

 He pointed at a sizable mansion towering above the smaller nearby homes.

 Harruq nodded in agreement.
 The two-story mansion was beautifully painted and decorated.
 The sides of the building were a deep brown, like the trunk of an ancient tree.
 The roof jutted out far past the walls.
 It was the color of wet leaves.
 Many windows decorated the front, all covered with silken curtains.

I looked at photos of Brandon growing up and wondered if I would view them in a slideshow at his funeral.
 My marriage suffered because Lisa defended Brandon vehemently; I completely understood, because I had grown up with a similar scenario: my mother‚Äôs unwillingness to see Thomas‚Äôs problem.
 My wife and I had many confrontations, and while we both knew he had a problem we disagreed on the severity and the solution.
 Soon, Brandon moved in with his girlfriend, Tiffanie, and she was as strung out as he was.
 When they were together, they looked like two skeletons embracing.
 They had grown fuzzy around their edges; it‚Äôs difficult to describe how they clung to each other in a desperate way as if they didn‚Äôt know where one ended and the other began.
 It was more than teenage passion driving them to that; it was dependence, an unhealthy co-dependence.
 They couldn‚Äôt meet anyone‚Äôs eyes; their pinpoint pupils darted around the room when I spoke to them.
 They couldn‚Äôt answer simple questions coherently.
 They babbled and told those outrageous stories.

As always with Alec's paintings, it took me a second before I could shift my perspective enough to translate the beautiful formations of light into something I could tie to the drab, dreary world I inhabited.
 It was the same grotto where we now stood.
 The warm glow from the climbing ivory and roses formed a backdrop awash in the silvery light of a full moon.
 Just visible off to one side was the pool, alive with enough microscopic life to give it a pale glow of its own to compliment the off-center reflection of a hundred tiny lights.
 A few seconds later I finally recognized that the subject of the piece was a female, reaching out towards the point of view with glowing hands.
 "She's beautiful.
 It's how I always imagined an angel would appear."
 Alec was silent for so long I finally tore my gaze from his masterpiece long enough to find that he was staring at me with surprise.
 "It's you, Adri.
 Of course it's beautiful."

He gave Brandon a phone number and a story for him to give to Steve.
 Hopefully this story would explain Brandon‚Äôs bust, now known by all of his associates: He was to acknowledge his bust and tell Steve that the cops didn‚Äôt catch him with drugs because no one would front him the Oxy he was to bring to the deal.
 Brandon owed everyone, including Steve, so that would not be difficult to believe.
 In fact, that part was the truth!
 He was then supposed to tell Steve that he needed help supplying one of his regulars while his parents were holding him with a tight leash and ask him if he could do it.
 All Brandon was asking for in return for this connection was a few Oxy pills dropped at our house as a referral fee.
 Brandon asked Steve to just put the pills on his windowsill so he could get high unbeknownst to his parents.
 The intention was to make Steve believe that Brandon was still using, and thus trustworthy.
 Brandon was a nervous wreck.
 He was completely confused after days of detox and scared to death that he was going to prison if the scheme failed.

It was simultaneously the scariest and most exciting thing I'd ever experienced.
 Even as I leaned in a little bit myself, my thundering heart seemed to be trying to leap out of my throat solely for the purpose of disrupting what looked very much like it was going to be my first kiss.
 Every tiny hair on my body stood up in a shiver of nervousness as he tilted his head to the side, and then he broke off, shaking himself slightly as he gave me a smile.
 For a second I thought he was rejecting me, that he'd decided not to kiss me because he wasn't interested.
 Only the way he reached out for my hand indicated that he really wasn't repulsed by me.
 It bothered me the entire time I was in History, and then just before I got to Physics it hit me.
 He hadn't stopped because he didn't want to kiss me.
 He stopped because with all of my blushing and near-terror it'd been obvious I wasn't ready to be kissed.
 It was the ultimate act of chivalry.
 I more or less floated through my last two classes.

We sat in silence for several seconds as I tried to process how that new piece of information fit in with everything else I already knew.
 The obvious, if somewhat selfish, implication was that maybe it really was possible for someone like Alec to want to be with someone like me.
 There were plenty of other things to think about though.
 "Wow, is that hard?
 I mean living with people who can do all those things?"
 Rachel's shrug was surprisingly sincere.
 "It was a bit at first, especially right after Alec first started manifesting.
 Okay, maybe I was crazy jealous then, and again a couple of years later when it became apparent I wasn't going to manifest anything, but I got over it."
 My raised eyebrow was completely involuntary, and apparently more eloquent than I'd realized.
 At least it earned me another laugh.

 ‚ÄúWhy did you fight the elves?‚Äù she asked when their silence had stretched for more than half an hour.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be a long story,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúWe have time.‚Äù
 He chuckled.
 ‚ÄúAye, I guess we do.‚Äù
 He told her of Velixar and his plans.
 He told her of the strength, weapons, and armor granted to him.
 Hesitantly, he recounted killing Ahrqur and the people of Cornrows, a fresh wave of shame filling him as he thought of both.

I hadn‚Äôt made up my mind before the door opened beside me.
 She purred.
 ‚ÄúWell, well.

 Her curls brushed my face on their way past, taking my head on a dizzying spin.

Undaunted, the elf stepped closer, ducked underneath the guard captain‚Äôs return swing, and then kicked at the arrow still lodged in his shin, finally making Antonil drop his blade.
 The elf stood, drawing an arrow as he did.
 Antonil, now lying on the ground, struggled to bring his shield over his chest.
 Part of it caught beneath his side and would not come.
 He would not be able to block in time.
 A loud wooden crash stole away the elf‚Äôs focus.
 The door to the home behind him exploded into splinters as a huge projectile shot through it.
 The elf spun, his eyes widening as he saw what had shattered the door: a massacred elven body.
 He readied his bow and released an arrow at the next sign of movement.
 Unfortunately, it was another elven body, curiously missing its left arm and leg.

We settled onto the floor of the small den, our backs against the wall, the rock overhang blocking the light of the moon.
 ‚ÄúThat is my flame,‚Äù Chevelle said, ‚Äútry to extinguish it.‚Äù And my training began.

 Early the next morning, even before first light, Chevelle woke me for training.
 Gone were the games we had played.
 These lessons were intense and stressful.
 I‚Äôd been unable to generate magic on demand so he‚Äôd started lunging at me with weapons, sticks, fire, forcing me to respond to protect myself.
 After each attack, he would come right back at me and if I tried to repeat a tactic for defense, he would overpower my magic and push me to find a new maneuver.
 I was beat, winded, drained.

During this same period, un employment rose by 23 million persons, representing a 259 per cent increase in the overall unemployment rate.
 More people are working than ever before, yet at the same time more people are unemployed, because a larger proportion of the population seek jobs.
 Growing anxiety about employment prospects in the West were aggravated by a sudden 50 per cent increase in unemployment after 1990, which displaced an additional 10 million workers in the OECD and was equalled only by the previous high of 1983.
 This increase is now showing signs of reversal.
 These average figures disguise significant differences in performance of countries within the OECD.
 Since 1950, Japan‚Äôs employment rate has risen from 43 per cent to around 50 per cent, while unemployment has remained in the 1 to 3 per cent range.
 The overall proportion of the population employed in the European Community has declined by 1 per cent since 1965 and is presently just under 41 per cent, but the percentage of the working age population employed has remained more or less constant over the past three decades, at 67 per cent, whereas in other OECD regions it has risen significantly ‚Äì to exceed 75 per cent in North America, Scandinavia and Japan.
 Europe‚Äôs lower labour participation rate is attributable to a number of factors.
 A far higher percentage of the European workforce was engaged in agriculture 25 years ago and has since shifted to non-agricultural sectors, an adjustment that occurred in the United States during earlier decades.
 During the 1980s Europe chose a high-wage path to growth, passing on the benefits to the existing workforce but creating relatively few new jobs; whereas the United States, with a similar economic growth rate over the decade, showed lower income growth per worker, but a steadily rising employment rate.

 But I was so resentful toward Fannie for putting me there, I usually saw a black blob of death consuming her.
 ‚ÄúA Monarch,‚Äù I‚Äôd say.
 She looked beyond me at the few inches of open floor, and I took the opportunity to bolt past her down the hall, straight out the door at full speed.
 I ran from the house, ignoring the paths; other elves would be no help to me.
 I kept running until I was certain she wasn‚Äôt coming, and then I collapsed at the edge of a meadow, breathless.
 I dropped my face into my hands, and might have wept if I‚Äôd not been so fueled by fear and adrenaline.
 ‚ÄúFreya?‚Äù a soft voice asked.
 I looked up, startled.

Then the dust and darkness swallowed him up until I couldn‚Äôt see him at all.
 Epilogue
 I padded silently through the long, dark halls.
 Emily and Jason walked wordlessly by my side.
 No one spoke because there was nothing to say, and so much to say, at the same time.
 It had been almost a day since Seth disappeared.
 A day since Kojas took him.
 I had told him, when he had first said that Kojas wanted to use him that he didn‚Äôt have to worry.
 I should have known that Kojas would do anything to get him, and now Seth was gone.
 After he had been taken and Jason had awakened, the faery jerks had scattered.

As I turned in the entryway to close the door as quietly as I had opened it, I felt a presence.
 I turned around and two hands were on my neck choking me and shoving me against the door.
 Dino, in the darkness, had a grip on my neck that he would not release.
 I grabbed his wrist and tried to push his hands off to no avail.
 I couldn‚Äôt breathe, so I couldn‚Äôt talk.
 It was oddly silent except for a pinging sound, as if someone was dropping pennies in a pan.
 It was the sound of the puka shells from the necklace I was wearing landing on the tile floor beneath me.
 Ping, ping, puh dit dit, ping.
 More of the shells fell and bounced along the tile.
 I could not get a next breath.

Before Cliff and I go out to slug golf balls into the trees, Toni and I talk in the kitchen.
 After a wandering conversation about food, kids and baseball somehow leads to spiritual matters, Toni mentions that she has always supposed people turn to God for comfort.
 What I don‚Äôt know about people in general could probably fill all the world‚Äôs libraries.
 But I can offer that I have turned to God at various times for a variety of reasons.
 In hopes of gaining understanding.
 To lessen my likelihood of hurting people.
 Out of fear.
 On account of worries about my kids.
 Out of gratitude.
 I didn‚Äôt tell Toni about Eric or Chicago and the Polish fellow I could easily have murdered, or about blaming myself for the heart attack that set up my dad for the big one.

It fell backward and they turned to my hiding spot, searching for me.
 Two knives flew and a dwarf and man collapsed on the ground.
 I saw Jason hide behind his tree again.
 One dwarf got too close to Emily and she raised her arms, dousing him in flames.
 He screeched and fell to the ground, withering and then went still.
 Seth ran from the trees, brandishing his sword.
 He swung it around and clashed with one of the faery's swords.
 The faery brought the other around and Seth twisted to avoid it.
 He grabbed the blade and flung it out of the man's arms.
 He roared angrily and threw his sword down on Seth, who raised his up to block it.

‚ÄúYes, I was, but I think I was more concerned that you would wake the dead with your screams and they would attack us too.‚Äù I smacked him lightly on the arm and laid down next to him.
 I stared at the sky.
 ‚ÄúSo where are we?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, our winged friend managed to get us out of the woods and near the mountains.
 You can see them over there.‚Äù He pointed off in the distance and I spotted the mountains towering above everything else.
 ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good, at least all of this wasn‚Äôt for nothing.‚Äù He sighed and closed his eyes.
 ‚ÄúYes, I didn't lose my hearing for nothing, because I had to listen to you scream.‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you ever going to drop that?‚Äù I asked.
 Seth smirked.
 ‚ÄúNope, it's going to haunt you for the rest of your life.‚Äù He made ghost sounds.
 ‚ÄúWait,‚Äù I said suddenly, ‚Äúweren't you going to tell Emily and Jason about you-know-what?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Seth asked lazily and plucked at the grass.
 I sat up and glared at him.

This man was dangerous.
 ‚ÄúChildren have been dying in our forest, all found horribly butchered,‚Äù Dieredon said.
 ‚ÄúAs you can plainly see, I am nowhere near the forest,‚Äù Velixar said.
 His voice was calm, disarming.
 Dieredon did not buy it.
 ‚ÄúGive me your name,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúEarn the privilege,‚Äù Velixar countered.
 The elf‚Äôs arms blurred, and then the bow was in his hands.
 He pulled no arrow, though, for he held the weapon much like one would hold a staff.
 ‚ÄúLeave this place,‚Äù Dieredon ordered as two long blades snapped out of either side of the bow and many spikes punched out the front.

He was clutching his head and groaning.

 I helped him sit up and handed him his sword.
 He laid it across his lap and looked at the ground.

Alec sighed, presumably in resignation, and then suddenly my legs were thrown up in front of me as he picked me up with inhuman speed.
 Only the steady pressure of Alec's arm around my waist kept me from screaming, and then I was back on my feet, and being carefully, but firmly shoved through a tangled knot of bodies.
 My shoes had never been intended to allow ankles to withstand that kind of punishment.
 Even just walking had been risky, so it wasn't a surprise when my right foot slipped, and a sharp knife of pain shot through that ankle as it collapsed under me.
 Dealing with blinding agony hadn't ever been my strong point.
 I opened my mouth to scream, only to find that no sound would come out.
 The world was still spinning, but I was oriented just enough to realize that Dominic had her hand over my mouth and nose.
 I pulled at her arm, but the effort was completely futile.
 Rising panic over not being able to breathe made me hammer at the iron bar pressing me against her, but she never looked away from whatever had captured her concentration.
 Rachel suddenly appeared off to my right, and she put her finger to her lips, and then sank all ten fingernails into Dominic's arm.

He was probably confused.
 The image of the day that Rodregas had started to hate him came back.
 A family of AElves had been taken prisoner; they were just common AElves with no real magic.
 Korin was interested in the father, a good-looking man.
 The wife was equally beautiful and they had a slim child named Jorin.
 Rodregas had taken Jorin under his wing.
 He had only been working at Raven Keep for a little over a year at the time and was still learning the names of the prisoners.
 Rodregas had thought that Jorin was a good lad, well behaved and bright, and his eyes were eager for signs of hope.
 Rodregas brought him extra food and words of reassurance.
 Ravenhurr had no need for him nor his mother, and he had seen other prisoners who were not of use set free.

For that, the Commission argued that concerted action is both necessary and possible to immediately improve employment opportunities for the poor.
 Chapter Four of this report presents a comprehensive package of strategies for both industrialized and developing countries that are as relevant and valid today as they were at the time of publication.
 In order to document the potential for accelerated job growth, ICPF conducted a special country study of India in 1991 and drew up a strategy for creating 100 million jobs in the country within a decade.
 The strategy, which focused on utilizing agriculture and agri-business as engines to stimulate rural incomes and employment opportunities, was endorsed and adopted by the then Government of India, but not implemented for a variety of reasons.
 A review of this strategy one decade later indicates that the potential for achieving full employment in India is fully alive and the current Government‚Äôs commitment provides the right circumstances to achieve it in practice.
 This will also serve as an example and model for other countries to emulate.
 Backed by this commitment, the main elements of a successful employment strategy for India have been identified in a separate report prepared for the New Delhi meeting.
 The strategy focuses on giving an income and employment orientation to Indian agriculture, increased support for expansion of enterprises in the informal sector, broadening the on-going self-help group revolution and fully extending it to agricultural operations, upgradation and expansion of the country‚Äôs vocational training system, promotion of entrepreneurship and full utilization of information technology as a catalyst for development.
 Prospects and Emerging Opportunities
 Viewing the global employment situation as a whole, there are strong grounds for confidence in a brighter future.

Rachel was saying something, but I couldn't really hear her.
 The void was gaping below me, when something grabbed my shoulder and shook me surprisingly hard.
 I opened my eyes to see Rachel looking at me.
 "I'm sorry I had to do that, Adriana, but you need to hear what I have to say."
 Half of me wanted to be angry, but the other half just wanted to collapse into the void.
 Force of habit won over anger and I passively let my defenses crumble, but apparently being shocked out of a collapse functioned much the same as having just come out of an attack.
 For the next few seconds at least I was safe, could think about anything I wanted without fear of the repercussions.
 Only Rachel was talking, ruining my concentration, so the only thing I could focus on was her words.
 "The rumor revolves around the fact that you tragically lost your boyfriend in a vicious car wreck."
 The immunity meant I hadn't expected the words to hurt, hadn't expected the flash of surprise that spiraled up from my center.

He fired arrows three at a time, his quiver never approaching empty.
 He ordered Sonowin lower, shouting out the command as another barrage of bone pelted four more elves to their deaths.
 Skimming above the darkness, Dieredon fired volley after volley behind him.
 When they were past the undead, he pulled Sonowin high into the air to observe the battlefield.
 The ranks of the undead were half of what they had been, yet still he could not see the lowered black hood he so badly needed to see.
 ‚ÄúCome, Sonowin, we will find him, even if it means killing every last one of his puppets.‚Äù
 The horse neighed and dove, spurred on by the sight of its own kind falling in death.

The destruction of tropical rain forests has been one result.
 The greatest security challenges of the twenty-first century are economic, not military or political.
 Employment is a sine qua non for meeting these challenges.
 A thorough examination of facts and a dispassionate analysis reveal grounds for hope and opportunities for action.
 The possibility of more rapid economic growth and rising incomes in both developed and developing countries ‚Äì spurred by further substantial reduction in defence spending, the diffusion and application of new technologies, economic liberalization leading to growth of international trade, the globalization of financial markets, and the emergence of new engines for global expansion among developing countries ‚Äì indicates that our apprehensions need not prove justified, provided society acts courageously and decisively to meet the challenge.
 A global overview of employment cannot do full justice to the special circumstances, problems and potentials of specific regions and countries, but it can dispel the growing concern that employment has become a problem beyond the means of governments or the global economy to eradicate or even contain.
 In the final analysis, creation of jobs for all is not a question of possibility.
 It is a question of necessity.
 Neither logic nor self-interest justify a detached attitude or a half-hearted effort to address this issue.
 As in the case of the recent global response to the threat of global warming from depletion of the ozone layer, it simply is not acceptable for us to remain indifferent or claim that we are powerless to act where the entire world‚Äôs vital self-interests are at stake.

He was speaking with Virden when he turned his head slowly toward me‚Ä¶ and I was staring into his eyes again.
 Oh, give me a break; he‚Äôs halfway across the village from you.
 But I was staring.
 Despite my resolve, color rose to my cheeks once more as I turned away.
 I couldn‚Äôt understand why he was affecting me this way.
 The pages stuffed in my shirt felt like fire against my skin.
 I quickened my pace, caught my toe on a root, and stumbled.
 As soon as I righted myself, I wasn‚Äôt able to stop myself from peeking back to see if he had noticed, but he was gone.
 I didn‚Äôt know if I was relieved.
 My mind went over the encounter again as I made my way home.

 The gym was ancient.
 The double entry doors each featured a quartet of small windows.
 When the gatekeeper refused to let us in because the tickets were sold out, Kenny‚Äôs usual good nature expired.
 He raised a fist as though to sock the gatekeeper, a boy in an ROTC costume.
 But instead of punching the kid, he drove his fist through one of the small windowpanes.
 The gatekeeper hollered.
 The next instant, we found ourselves surrounded by teachers, coaches, and a platoon of the ROTC.
 While the chatter of several witnesses turned it all into gibberish, and the gatekeeper shouted, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been drinking,‚Äù Kenny stood still, staring at his bloody fist as though wondering how it happened.
 Out of the crowd, a coach came striding.

 ‚ÄúAnd what about Nymphs?‚Äù asked Imeralda.
 ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù asked Rodregas.
 ‚ÄúIf I am your sworn ‚Äòman‚Äô could you also bring me into the Cathedral?‚Äù she asked.
 Rodregas nodded, ‚ÄúYes, I have known some Orqui and AElves who have joined the knighthood.
 I cannot think of any Hellborn or Nymphs staying there during my time.
 But that is more of a matter of the rareness of Hellborn, and Nymphs have never shown interest in joining the knighthood.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhile I am still hesitant to say that your cause is mine, I do wish to keep traveling with you two.
 I have always heard stories of the knights and would enjoy visiting the Cathedral.

 He enjoyed the company of the two of them.

He then headed back to the dungeon, stopping at the chicken coop to let out the chickens.
 They quickly spread all over the yard.
 It would be better for the town folk who lived so close to the fort if the Dire Cats were not starving when they left.
 On his way into the dungeon, he left all the doors propped open so the way out would be clear, and he made sure that all the other doors were closed.
 Luckily, the kitchen drudge had locked herself in the kitchen quarters.
 Rodregas then went back to the dungeon level and opened the opposite door and then the Dire Cats‚Äô prison door and watched.
 He had expected them to either bolt for it or stay in the ‚Äúsafety‚Äù of their room.
 Instead they both casually got up and walked out, as if they were guests in a fancy inn, with all the time in the world.
 As they walked out the door both cats gave him a casual glance as he held the two doors firmly closed together bracing for the weight if they threw themselves at the doors, but they just walked by and headed up the stairs.
 He wanted to follow, but Rodregas held himself back patiently waiting until it was safe.

Did he intend to return me to the village, to High Council?
 To keep me safe from the others?
 ‚ÄúYou remembered what they did to your mother?‚Äù I felt my face pale.
 I‚Äôd known they were dangerous, but did he mean to submit was to accept her fate?
 The image of flames and a circle of cloaks surrounding her was there again and I had to force it away before it turned to an image of me.
 Protection, he‚Äôd kept saying as we worked on magic.
 They‚Äôre going to burn me.
 ‚ÄúThey would kill me because of the pendant, the library?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, Frey.

Even though I lived on my own, I was still a kid and I knew no better than to live like one.
 I found myself associated with a group at school referred to by some as ‚Äúhot-rodders‚Äù and by others as ‚Äúburnouts.‚Äù The hot-rodders loved and raced every kind of American muscle car you could imagine, and this was what drew me to them.
 As every school has its ‚Äújocks,‚Äù ‚Äúnerds,‚Äù ‚Äúburnouts,‚Äù and other cliques and the reps that go along with them, it is difficult for an impressionable adolescent to avoid.
 The hot-rodders had a ‚Äúbad boy‚Äù reputation affiliated with drug use.
 Many hot-rodders did drugs and many of us sold drugs (usually to the jocks).
 It was the days of cocaine and pot, and I saw and consumed my share of it.
 Thomas became one of the bigger drug dealers in town.
 His house was filled with booze and drugs of all types.
 Cocaine was the most popular, that, and pot; but magic mushrooms and acid were also available.

Then I woke up.‚Äù Seth nodded.
 ‚ÄúMine was calling my name too and said to beware of the shadows.
 But I saw a ghost-like boy instead.
 Then I saw a glimpse of you and then I woke up.‚Äù ‚ÄúWho do you think they were?‚Äù I asked.
 ‚ÄúThe ghost kids.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don't know but I have a feeling that they weren't on Kojas' side,‚Äù he replied.
 I glanced over at Emily and Jason, making sure they were still sleeping.
 ‚ÄúWhy do you think they were in our dreams?
 Was the 'beware of the shadows' that important?‚Äù ‚ÄúDoes any of this ever make sense to us?‚Äù Seth asked with a shrug.
 ‚ÄúWe just wait it out like we always do.‚Äù Emily groaned and stretched.
 She opened her eyes, squinting at the two of us.

‚ÄúBut clearly he already has a greater sigil; no man can fight like that who does not have one.
 He is an impostor.
 He steals this knighthood from more deserving squires,‚Äù Van‚Äôdret said.
 At this Rodregas saw many people nodding, but he remained silent.
 It was not his turn to answer any question other than from the Grand Marshal.
 The Marshal Faurrenida voice made his displeasure and his dislike of arguing with a non-knight clear as he said, ‚ÄúWhile a knight has the full right to enter both the Lesser and Greater Sigil Chambers and take and sigil as his level of magic might allow, it is not a sigil he earns today.
 It is knighthood.
 Now, the discussion is over.‚Äù growled Marshal Faurrenida.
 To forestall any further argument, the Grand Marshal stepped forward quickly and drew his sword.
 The sword gleamed of the highest quality blue steel and red fire seemed to run its length.

Countries pursuing macro-economic growth paths have the necessary foundations for development, but that is only the first part.
 There can be no lasting development with the exclusion of social groups from the fruits of growth.
 Nor can there be long-term prospects for development when the environment is pillaged and the rights of future generations ignored.
 Finally, growth which is not accompanied by the improve ment of the social fabric of society will be only a hollow shell.
 For economic and social development to take place, it is important to promote the expansion of employment opportunities, the improvement of educational and health networks, support for the role of women in development and the pursuit of equality between the sexes.
 A hitherto ignored dimension of the development challenge is democratization: what I have chosen to call political development.
 There have been cases where development was accompanied by an authoritarian political system.
 But we have invariably seen that if the participation in the market place is not accompanied by political participation, development efforts are brought to naught by social and political instability.
 Political, economic and social development must be closely related, mutually supportive, deriving sustenance from one another.
 Once again, therefore, we see the inescapable relations governing the goals of peace, development and democratization these are the goals of the United Nations.

It would not be smart to make the Guild Dealer wait for even a moment.
 The Guild Dealer Taiga was not such a common man that he did his work from a desk; his desires and commands came during parties and social events.
 However, if you were truly honored, though personal invitations to dine with him in his personal solar overlooking his city you would get told his wishes.
 As Van‚Äôdret stepped through the arch he was struck by the bare simplicity of the solar.
 The city known as the Menagerie of Sky, Earth and Water that Taiga ruled and had created over the centuries was a lush place, full of pleasures and growing things.
 Anything that could be found in the world was said to be found within its gleaming walls and exotic gardens.
 However, the private place where it‚Äôs Master worked, was a stark contrast.
 It‚Äôs marble columns and arched ceiling spoke of simply sophistication and understated power, and much more accurately reflected the nature of its owner than the over the top shows and pleasures of the Menagerie.
 Two small intricate waterfalls softly trickled down each side wall to the, providing a soft soothing sound.
 The back of the room was an archway leading to the terrace, overhead the incredible crystal ceiling let in the natural daylight of the late afternoon sun and would illuminate the top of the tower under its own power during the night.

One of the regulars was Jack Kerouac.
 My only living hero, according to Bobby, had become nothing more than a woeful drunk who sat brooding over his liquor until closing time.
 Then, most every evening, he went home with whatever washed out female lasted so long.
 Raskolnikov
 While Bob and I drove home in a 1952 Chevy we bought for $20 from Bobby Casso, I was a lousy companion.
 All I could think about were tragedies.
 Eric's death.
 Jack Kerouac, and how neither his talent, quests, travels, friends, lovers, nor his studies of Buddhism had saved him from a pitiful life.
 I wondered if all the highs, mind trips, love affairs and communions he had written about were cover-ups for his soul's desperation.
 I had found the real world to be at least as tragic, seamy, unjust and dangerous as Billy Graham preached.

Recognizing the right of every citizen to employment is the essential basis and the most effective strategy for generating the necessary political will to provide jobs for all.
 What is needed is not another job generation programme, but a change in social values that will accelerate the natural and inevitable evolution of society, from one in which labour is regarded as a dispensable resource to one based on full human rights and the enormous productive potential of the human being.
 The type and magnitude of change needed today is comparable to that embodied in President Roosevelt‚Äôs New Deal for the American people during the Great Depression, at a time when 25 per cent of the workforce was unemployed: to the Indian government‚Äôs decision to launch the Green Revolution in the mid-1960s to achieve self-sufficiency in foodgrains, at a time when the country was highly dependent on imported food to stave off famine: and to Mikhail Gorbachev‚Äôs initiatives late in the 1980s to end the Cold War and transform Soviet society.
 Is Full Employment Possible?
 Few will argue with the compelling logic, justice and idealism of this view, but many will question the feasibility of practically implementing it.
 As long as we continue to believe that society is truly helpless to manage job growth, there will be strong resistance to the full employment goal.
 We must recognize that the present status and functioning of our economies is the result of specific choices that have been made in the past, based on priorities and values that were relevant or dominant at the time, but which we certainly are not obliged to live with indefinitely and, in fact, are continuously in the process of discarding in favour of new values and priorities.
 The rapid adoption of environmentally friendly policies around the world is positive proof of how quickly the rules, even economic rules, can change when there is a concerted will for a breakthrough.
 So too, the welfare policies of the European Union that have resulted in a 70 per cent rise in national income over the past two decades, but only a 9 per cent increase in the number of jobs, were due to conscious choices that favoured the employed over the unemployed, not the inevitability of the market.
 Recent economic debate in the United States has brought this truth to the fore.

There was no way I was going to be able to pull off a dress like that.
 Even assuming it didn't fall off of me, I was still going to look like a walrus.
 "Stop fidgeting, Adri.
 It's just a dance, not a funeral, and if you don't hold still your makeup isn't going to turn out right."
 Rachel poked me in the ribs, and then went back to work on the last few details of my 'new and improved' look.
 I'd actually been trying to sneak a look in the mirror to find out how everything was shaping up, but it wasn't worth trying to explain.
 With the pall that'd descended over the pack once we'd made it back, it was almost certain she wouldn't believe me.
 Nobody even knew where we'd gone, but they'd keyed off of our mood faster than I would've believed possible.
 The results hadn't been good.
 Jasmin stepped back around behind Dominic as I was watching, and for the first time I got a good idea of how the massively piled style Jasmin had been working on for the last half hour was going to turn out.

Rodregas fell on top of the armored form, grabbed the bottom of the helmet, and ripped it off.
 Unfortunately, it was firmly secured.
 When Rodregas ripped it off he took a good section of jaw with the helm.
 Rodregas then threw the helm aside and punched the man in the face, full strength, several times.
 His first hit smashed the front of Nordien‚Äôs face.
 The second blow shattered it.
 The third blow smashed the head to pulp.
 Rodregas probably should have picked up Nordien‚Äôs mace and shield, but he also knew that without plate armor, he could not afford a long drawn out series of pounding matches.
 Rodregas would fight like a lion instead.
 He charged the next closest squire who was approaching another squire.

As Brandon crashed through the studio's far wall in an explosion of plaster and lumber, I tried to shield my eyes, only to find that I couldn't move.
 The incongruity of being restrained when I couldn't see anything constraining my movements was enough to finally snap me back to wakefulness, but it was still several seconds before I stopped thrashing and realized it'd just been an extraordinarily terrifying nightmare.
 As soon as I stopped moving, the iron band around my arms relaxed and slipped away.
 "Are you okay?
 I'm sorry about that, I was afraid you were going to hurt yourself."
 Alec's even tones caressed me like a calming breeze.
 I finally oriented myself enough to realize that the warm, solid surface my back was resting against wasn't a wall.
 "I'm sorry.
 It was a nightmare."
 My voice came out raw and scratchy, like I'd been talking for hours, or possibly just screaming for the last minute or so.

 "I love you, Marie."
 "Rick," she breathed, her hands sliding to his neck, squeezing, pulling him to her.
 His mouth covered hers, his kiss slow and hot and thorough.
 She wrapped her arms around him, trying to get closer to him.
 When he raised his head, she whimpered, wanting his mouth on hers again.
 But she gasped with pleasure as he began nibbling on her earlobe.
 Rick wanted to do much more than kiss her, and she was making it difficult to resist.
 He'd never held a woman so eager, so responsive to his slightest touch.
 But he had to stop.

 Acknowledgments I would like to thank all of the drug and alcohol rehabilitation professionals who choose to tackle the daunting task of attempting to help those in this world who cannot take just one drink but must consume the whole bottle and those who cannot take a prescription pill as prescribed but must crush, snort, smoke or inject these powerful drugs to feed the monster of addiction.
 Many of these counselors and staff who help the addicts in our lives were once addicts themselves.
 They choose to ‚Äúgive back‚Äù because they have either finally come to understand what caused them to want to destroy themselves and are compelled to share this knowledge or they know that they can only continue their sobriety by staying where they found it, or both.
 Either way, they are the students who became the teachers of recovery and only they are bullet proof to the lies that flow so freely from an addict‚Äôs mouth.
 I would like to thank the staff of Narconon and every other facility that helps our addicts attempt to identify and handle the demon they cannot resist.
 I would like to thank Chris Tillman for encouraging me to turn my cathartic writings into a book to share my story with others.
 I would like to thank my mother for being the best mother she could be despite astronomical obstacles that faced a single parent in the 60‚Äôs with no financial support from her first husband and an abusive second husband.
 Mom, we never knew how hard life was for you because you made sure we came first and you protected us the best you could!

Large trees of a type I didn't recognize towered on each side, shooting up dozens of feet before branching out into an interlocking canopy that cut the harsh sunlight down to a greenish haze that swayed with the gentle motion of a breeze too slight for me to feel.
 A gravel pathway cut its winding way between real, live grass before terminating in a sandy courtyard that my eyes had been avoiding, almost as though my mind wasn't ready to deal with what it knew it would see there.
 The pack had turned at our appearance and six sets of unblinking, inhuman eyes stared up at me.
 A low growl sounded from one of the throats, and Donovan edged in front of me as the largest of the figures turned and struck out at another of the shape shifters with blurring speed.
 A startled yelp bounced off of the valley walls, and then Donovan relaxed slightly and started forward.
 "We should be safe now.
 Master Alec seems to have things well in hand."
 His word choice didn't inspire an overabundance of confidence, but I could hardly turn and run away after begging to be allowed to come watch.
 The path seemed to shrink as we were walking, and almost too quickly sand replaced the crunch of gravel under our feet.
 I recognized Alec's humanoid form from before, a massive, black, heavily furred tower of muscle, claws and fangs.

During normal periods of slow and gradual change, the impact or role of other dimensions operates below the surface and appears minimal.
 Economists studying the results of economic variables tend to overlook the influence of factors from other fields on the assumption that non-economic factors are constant.
 Under relatively stable and static conditions, these economics principles can be employed to predict changes in economic variables to a considerable extent.
 But under circumstances in which underlying economic, social and political conditions are undergoing radical change, the relevance and predictive capacity of purely economic concepts is quite limited.
 This was the situation confronting the states of the region at the beginning of the transition period, and the reason why the actual results of the reform differed so drastically from what had been anticipated.
 The situation in Eastern and Central Europe was further complicated by the disproportionately large size and importance of the defence sector in the economy.
 This necessitates, not only a change from one economic system to another, but also a restructuring of the entire economy from a defence orientation to a consumer orientation.
 This change in structure could not be brought about by reliance on macro-economic policy.
 2.Political and social consensus is essential for rapid social change: In a democratic society, the market cannot be instituted by decrees or authoritarian methods which belong to the old sys tem.
 In the new political climate, reforms will be successful only in the measure that they are understood and accepted by the population.

A conscious shift of focus could lead to the development of more labour-intensive production processes.
 The production of more food to meet the needs of a burgeoning population has been one of the outstanding global achievements of the post-war period.
 It has demonstrated the extraordinary capacity of humankind to meet a collective challenge of monumental proportions.
 It has harnessed the power of science and technology for the most cherished of purposes ‚Äì preserving human lives.
 It has released the initiative and pride of long suppressed peoples to achieve self-sufficiency and determine their own destinies.
 It has finally lifted the suffocating blanket of pessimistic economic determinism that has stifled human hopes and aspirations for nearly 200 years since Thomas Malthus first set forth the thesis that human population will always outrun the growth of food production, thus ensuring the perpetual poverty of humankind.
 The remarkable achievements of countries such as India, which at a time when famine threatened to claim millions of lives launched a massive national programme that increased foodgrain production by three-quarters, and China, which nearly doubled food grain production over the last two decades, are outstanding testaments to the accomplishments of people in many countries.
 Worldwide, production increases in major cereal crops are estimated to have provided enough food for more than a billion people.
 Food has become a symbol of our collective human endeavour to create a better world for all.
 But the victory has been partial and neither the challenge nor the opportunity which food presents have been fully addressed.

Brandon's voice was smooth and flawless as always, but even that couldn't distract me enough to miss the flash of dislike in Cassie's eyes as she sat down next to Britney.
 Nobody talked about anything important, which was good since I couldn't focus on anything other than the fact I'd just been given one more sign, a really big one, that Brandon was interested in me.
 A couple of minutes before the warning bell rang, I looked up from the group and saw another familiar face leaving the lunchroom.
 Everything suddenly dropped into place, and I grabbed Brandon's arm.
 "Who's that?"
 Brandon tensed up for a second, and then his massive arm relaxed under my hand as he followed my gaze.
 "That's Ben."
 His voice dropped to a rumbling whisper.
 "The one I told you about the other day."
 It was incredibly obvious, all the while making absolutely no sense.

Consciousness was slow returning.
 When my eyes finally fluttered open, I was surprised to find myself in Alec's arms once again.
 "Are you okay?"
 He tried to set me down, to stand me up on my feet, but I grabbed onto him as tightly as my shaking arms were able.
 "Don't leave me.
 Please don't make me go."
 I didn't realize I was crying until I tried to talk.
 It was embarrassing, but was I too worried about being sent away to care.
 Any amount of ridicule would be worthwhile if it meant being able to stay with Alec.

Brandon chuckled as he threw the Mustang into reverse and sped out of the lane faster than normal.
 The stereo clicked over to another song as we flipped around and headed back into town.

 "Wow, you really are a city girl.

 I'd finally worked through things enough inside my mind, to respond, but he bulldozed right over me.

His eyes were normal golden cat eyes, not the glowing red of most of the other creatures.
 The only daemonic aspect to the shape was a pair of horns coming out the sides of his head, not that dissimilar to Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs curving up and back protecting the skull.
 Only the tips were different; while Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs curved up, these curled down at the end.
 While Doi‚Äôvan had seen a lion‚Äôs head on another man-like shape in the distance, and of course Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs dragon had a lion‚Äôs head, he felt drawn to this shape.
 While he was not as attracted as he had felt with the Celestial Lion, he guessed that this was as good a match as he would find among the Infernal Daemons.
 Rodregas looked back toward Doi‚Äôvan, but could no longer see him.
 He knew he should check on him and Imeralda, but he also knew that they had all chosen to walk this path.
 It had ended up being a more interesting path than expected, but they all wanted to see where it went.
 He reached up and petted the powerful black head of the creature.
 Its ears had the only hint of non-black on the beast, a slight touch of silver.

Every developmental achievement results in an abandonment of old behaviours and attitudes, and the acceptance of new ones.
 Development destroys survival-based, traditional values and creates achievement-oriented, progressive values.
 Over the last two centuries in countries around the world development has strengthened expansive values that encourage greater freedom, tolerance, individual initiative, self-confidence and self-respect, dynamism, risk-taking, efficiency, punctuality, organization, communication and cooperation, open-mindedness and respect for new ideas, innovation and creativity.
 At the same time development has weakened values that support respect for tradition and hierarchy, seniority and authority, self-effacement and humility, patience and perseverance, generosity and self-sacrifice.
 The nineteenth century tolerated values based on the exploitation by people over people through slavery, colonialism and war, and the domination of nature by man.
 The guiding values for the coming century are freedom and respect for the individual, social equity, tolerance of human diversity and harmony with the environment.
 Development is widely regarded as the cause of moral decline and increasing corruption, crime and violence.
 These negative consequences are primarily due to the fact that freedom has been extended to vast sections of the population which were confined in the past by rigid social barriers and minimum expectations, so they never had need or occasion to embrace the values they now eschew.
 The earlier self-restraint has been replaced by a self-assertion that has not yet acquired the productive values needed for achievement.
 Rising expectations enhance this tendency.

 Ned ‚Äì Sir, there is no need to be rude, it was just a simple request for some common courtesy.
 Art ‚Äì You‚Äôre correct, there is no reason to be rude, and this is hardly the place for obscene language.
 I just have other things on my mind this day, but I will try to watch what I say.
 I humbly apologize for my rudeness.
 Ned ‚Äì No hard feelings.
 Personal problems eh?
 Art ‚Äì Personal problems.
 I apologize once again.

Brandon told us that it suddenly struck him as he sat on the bathroom floor comforting a young man as he convulsed and withered in pain.
 Brandon was the young man on the floor twelve months ago and he had no idea who comforted him that day but he remembered his compassion well.
 He had evolved in a short year from the position of a detoxing addict receiving compassion to the position of a former addict providing compassion.
 Brandon is giving back!
 Brandon considers the staff and students his second family.
 We don‚Äôt see Brandon often because he works in the ‚Äúboonies‚Äù many hours away but we talk to him almost every night.
 He usually calls us late after his shift ends around 11 pm.
 My wife and I put him on the speaker phone when he calls so we can both share his day with him.
 He has no car so he walks about one mile back on the shoulder of the narrow country road in Werner Springs as he talks to us.
 You can hear the crunching sound of the road‚Äôs gravel beneath his feet and imagine the gait of his walk from the delay between the sounds.

It was not unusual for Dino‚Äôs associates to come to the house with weapons inside their jackets.
 When they played poker, stacks of hundred dollar bills spilled across the table, and one of the requirements to sit at the table was to put your gun in a pile of weapons across the room.
 I guess they didn‚Äôt want the loser to play his trump card with a pistol!
 My brother and I hustled drinks for them for small tips.
 After we were told to go to bed, we would hide behind the counter that blocked the table where they played cards.
 We could stay there late into the night and hear details of these shady lives.
 They all had odd nicknames.
 One man was called ‚ÄúThe Painter‚Äù and I have no idea where the name came from but I did know that if they needed someone‚Äôs house ‚Äúpainted‚Äù that this man was going there to kill them.
 He was a hit man, plain and simple!

 He took her face in his hands, making her look into his eyes.
 "Everything'll be fine, sweetheart.

 He brushed his lips over hers.
 Marie didn't relax until everyone had tasted the lasagna that evening.
 It was good, and she smiled when Rick winked at her over his second forkful.
 "Do you cook a lot?"

 ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a loveable puppy dog, but I do not think he is smitten.
 Are you, Harruq?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúUm, course not,‚Äù the half-orc said.
 Aurelia and Qurrah shared a quick, knowing smile.
 The frail half-orc‚Äôs face lost much of its lifelessness, and a gentle caring filled his eyes.
 His seriousness quickly buried it, but Aurelia had seen enough.
 ‚ÄúI shall leave you two to your studies and sparring,‚Äù Qurrah said after a long pause to torture Harruq.
 ‚ÄúAlthough I doubt the wisdom of leaving him alone with such a beautiful teacher.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúGood thing you will not have to worry about that, considering I see no beautiful teachers around,‚Äù Aurelia replied.

I wondered if it would ever seem real.
 Eventually, I made my way back, wrapping my arms around myself to control the shivers.
 I was surprised and more than a little grateful to find a shelter had already been set up for me.
 The idea of being drenched hadn‚Äôt mattered until the cool air cut across the lake.
 Chevelle nodded toward the hut as he prepared a fire, and I found my pack on a bed of birch branches, along with a pile of dry clothes.
 As I tugged off my soaked pants to exchange them for the new ones, I wondered if Chevelle had brought both sets or if they‚Äôd been packed by Junnie in that small, strange village.
 I couldn‚Äôt fathom why I hadn‚Äôt considered he‚Äôd so easily be able to follow me when I‚Äôd run from there, how I‚Äôd been oblivious to the dangers of being caught.
 The shirt was fitted to my shape but of a heavier fabric, and a pair of boots was at the bottom of the stack; it must be much colder in the mountains.
 It reminded me of stepping out of the cold wet gown on the bank of the creek, finding the scroll, the map.
 Chevelle‚Äôs words echoed in my mind.

 He was not sure what to say but Doi‚Äôvan was.
 ‚ÄúBefore you examine it more, can you come look at what we found?

We took long walks as a family and we talked like we hadn‚Äôt in years, or possibly ever.
 We sat by the fireplace and cooked meals together in this tiny motel kitchen.
 We hiked one day through the forest and climbed a small mountain where we stood together and looked out at the beauty of the nature that surrounded us.
 When your children are young you have many special moments and they pass by so fast because they are so frequent.
 People always warn you how fast your children will grow and one day it happens and you realize that you were warned.
 When your children get old enough to move out of your home, you have very few opportunities to have special family moments and that makes them even more wonderful.
 We returned to our home after the trip and we went to bed late that night.
 I woke that morning before my wife and my sons.
 I brewed my morning coffee and I walked into Brandon‚Äôs room.
 I woke Brandon and I handed him one of the drug tests we still had from our failed attempt to rehabilitate him.

"That's it?
 You aren't going to give any kind of real reason?
 I guess I should at least be glad you aren't going to lie to me.
 Unless you really didn't ever want to go, and were lying to me all along."
 Rachel shrank in on herself a little.
 It almost looked like she was going to cry, which should have made me feel bad, but I was too mad to care.
 I'd been miserable the whole way there, and especially the whole way back, and then she wanted to just pretend like none of it had happened.
 Rachel's lip trembled slightly as she finally managed to get a response out.
 "This isn't like you.
 Why are you doing this?"

Those bows had primarily been ornamental trophies for Ravenhurr; Rodregas thought that they symbolized a previous victory.
 Only a few of the guards would have had the power to use them and Ravenhurr kept guards with even small power away from the keep.
 Against the leather armor of the slavers there would be no defense, even if they had shields; the arrows would likely blast through anything they had.
 Of course, against the Immortalist guards it was a different matter; their armor would stop the arrows.
 And, of course, their weapons would be equally effective against his armor, going through it like butter and into his flesh if he was not fast enough.
 Depending on their sigils, they were likely to be either faster or stronger or both.
 But Rodregas‚Äô short swords would not cut their armor.
 It put them at an extreme disadvantage.
 As the arrows flew over his head, he became aware of the other disadvantage of bows.
 They were dealing with a limited supply of arrows; once the arrows where all shot, they lost their main advantage.

 The game was against our team‚Äôs rival, Grossmont High School.

 When she looked up at him, so beautiful and trusting and fragile, he bent his head to kiss her.
 But she turned her face away.
 "I'm sorry," he whispered, kissing her temple instead of her lips, her full, soft, luscious red lips .

 Her last words confirmed it.
 ‚ÄúNo one knew to check.
 How would they?

That move was similar to one of the moves Doi‚Äôvan had taught him with the quarterstaff.
 A normal lancer did not have the strength to use the heavy lance in such a way.
 His blow landed high and Rodregas drove his lance into the man‚Äôs shoulder.
 Shattered pieces of wood filled the air.
 His opponent flew out of the saddle, an ungainly sight, and landed hard on the arena floor.
 He did not get back up.
 After a few minutes the official signaled Rodregas‚Äô victory.
 Rodregas headed back to Doi‚Äôvan who said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that technique is what the knights had in mind.‚Äù His voice showed his personal pleasure, knowing that a move he had taught Rodregas lead to his victory.
 Rodregas nodded and said, ‚ÄúDecided that my advantage of strength was being matched by armor and steed, so it was time to use agility.
 I was not sure it would work.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt will be harder the next time.

A hand touched his forehead.
 All the anger that had raged inside Harruq roared like a fire suddenly loosed upon a dry forest.
 Sweat poured from his skin.
 His head jerked upward, his eyes soaking in the white of Velixar‚Äôs hand and the dim glow of the stars.
 Power flowed into him, his muscles stretching and tightening in a chaotic manner.
 ‚ÄúRise, Harruq Tun,‚Äù Velixar said.
 ‚ÄúRevel in the power of Karak.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúBy the gods, brother, if you could see yourself,‚Äù Qurrah said, his voice full of shock and wonder.

But then she'd been in a strange place; now she was home.
 She should be ecstatic.
 She'd tried for over five weeks to get home.
 Tuesday she'd spent a delightful day with her family, the best of her adult life.
 Her father had amazed her by showing her his love in a variety of ways.
 He and her brother had reconciled.
 She'd had several of the heart-to-heart talks with her mother that she'd longed for.

And then his lips had touched hers.
 She shivered beneath the hot spray as she remembered the pleasure she'd felt.
 But that pleasure had frightened her, because it was wrong.
 She was betrothed to Davis.
 When she was dressed, she put her betrothal ring back on.
 She shouldn't have left it off last night.
 And she should have asked Rick to set an alarm for her so that she could have walked in the garden this morning.
 She shouldn't skip any mornings; she never knew which day might be the one when she'd find herself back in 1927.
 When she went downstairs, Rick was watching television.

The frog went on top and Jordaan‚Äôs other hand went on top of the frog.
 Jordaan then said, ‚ÄúThis is going to hurt, it will feel like someone is drawing a pattern under your skin with a knife.
 If you pull away before it is done, you will mess up the pattern and it will use up your magic without adding the benefits of the sigil.‚Äù As Jordaan finished speaking he looked in Rodregas‚Äô eyes until he nodded his understanding.
 He knew what was coming.
 He could feel Jordaan‚Äôs magic start to pour into his hands and into the frog.
 A sensation emanating from the frog began to fill his senses.
 Without Rodregas‚Äô conscious will, his own magic raised from the core of his being.
 The two magic forces seemed to mix and then enter the frog.
 They seemed to pour from the frog back into his own body.
 That power felt like a thousand small knives digging into his flesh.

The teacher was engaged with a carburetor and didn‚Äôt notice me trespassing in his class.
 I found Billy and Cliff wearing goggles, huddled over the head to a Chevy, grinding the valves.
 They had decided Mrs. Bole and whatever trouble they were in could wait.
 They had one more valve to grind.
 Then we stepped out into the sunlight.
 While I gave them the news, Cliff kicked gravel with both feet.
 Billy stared at the sky.
 His chin trembled.
 A college boy guarded the parking lot.
 We had to get a note from the office before he would unlock the gate and let us out.

"No, please.
 It was entirely my fault.
 I shouldn't have tried to squeeze past you like that."
 The smile was still there.
 That had to be a good sign.
 Usually when people said something nice and didn't mean it their smiles only lasted as long as they were speaking.
 I tried a tentative smile in return and his widened slightly.
 "I'm Brandon."
 Feeling more than a little nervous, I allowed him to capture my right hand in his.

 His two albums, ‚ÄúI Was a Child When Smaller,‚Äù and ‚ÄúRain and other Distractions,‚Äù were mega-sellers.
 Buddy made it.
 He made it big.

My pride would take a back seat to Brandon‚Äôs needs.
 His drug problem was more important than the grudge I was holding over my brother‚Äôs drug-induced antics.
 I felt like I was selling out.
 But somewhere in my heart I guess I had always hoped that Thomas and I would mend the damage between us.
 That one day I could forgive.
 That one day our families would spend a holiday together, and that holiday would lead to another and eventually things would be as normal as they could be.
 Part of me also felt that my older brother was in need of a way to get back in good graces of the family and that maybe I could give this to him by reaching out.
 I contacted Thomas in desperation, and he did have the connections to get my son into Narconon, a private rehab program that we couldn‚Äôt afford.
 We put the word out through some of Brandon‚Äôs friends that his Uncle Thomas could help him get into this private rehab if he wanted the help, but Brandon had to want it.
 Chapter 22: In Sight of the Bottom About a month had passed since we talked with Thomas and sent the word out to Brandon.

They couldn‚Äôt meet anyone‚Äôs eyes; their pinpoint pupils darted around the room when I spoke to them.
 They couldn‚Äôt answer simple questions coherently.
 They babbled and told those outrageous stories.
 They were sick.
 When my wife and I heard sirens or the phone rang late at night, we always thought the worst.
 Certain police or crime television shows would give us lumps in our throats as we would silently look at each other and know we were thinking the same thing‚Ä¶ that might be our son.
 One afternoon while I was at work, Lisa was trying to help Brandon out by organizing some of his bills.
 Brandon told her that he needed to run a quick errand.
 She called me later that day and said she had lost track of him and he wasn‚Äôt returning her calls or answering his phone.
 All the usual horrible thoughts began to surface in our minds.

The one on the right came in too close, and Rodregas gave him a good hard jab with his elbow in the stomach.
 Rodregas heard his attacker‚Äôs entire breath exit at his blow and he followed him to the ground.
 Rodregas followed up with a roundhouse kick and laid a good blow into the kidney area of the other man.
 Rodregas realized that his attackers were clearly not trained fighters.
 He felt himself relax as he realized that they posed no real danger to him now that he was on his feet and aware.
 Just as Rodregas relaxed from the heart pounding life or death moment that had awoken him, the man holding the rake stepped forward.
 Rodregas realized that he was even taller and bigger than the first one.
 The attacker swung the rake right at him with all his weight behind it.
 Rodregas was too close to dodge, and the rake hit his wounded gut straight on with the full brunt of his attacker‚Äôs weight.
 Rodregas swooned in pain as his fresh wound took the blunt of the blow.

Nothing that mattered yesterday mattered anymore.
 My gut felt as if a big snake were coiled inside it.
 My heart was a huge lump of coal.
 I walked faster and groaned and wondered why I couldn‚Äôt weep.
 I thought of how Eric was ten times the human I would ever be.
 If he couldn‚Äôt become Superman, I estimated my chances equaled about the square root of zero.
 Mystery
 All these years, I have believed that in some vaguely Christ-like way, Eric died as a sacrifice.
 I reasoned like this: From at least two months away, he saw a big change approaching.
 As it neared, he apprehended it ever more clearly.

Then I knew why they beat and killed him.
 All the other dwarves were on Kojas.
 This dwarf must have betrayed Kojas to bring information to whoever ‚Äúher majesty‚Äù was and to help us into Igneeria.

 I suddenly felt awful because I knew who the thing was.
 Kojas.

 ‚ÄúThe little traitor thought he could fool us,‚Äù Kojas announced, ‚Äúbut he was wrong.

I refused to tell him anything and he could not force me in my condition.
 I could see his plans for it already forming.
 I was almost happy it would not be powerful, half human and unmagical.
 I wondered if it could even be brought to term, I was ill so often now.
 The elders discussed it constantly‚Äîit was so unusual to be sick, but it must have been a result of the pregnancy.
 Several of them were assigned to watch me and I had to listen to their incessant chatter.
 They seemed thrilled not to know how or when I had gotten this way, carrying on about young elves and their quests.
 Ruby‚Äôs hand was on my shoulder, shaking me awake.

The soldier panicked and turned to run, but found his feet entangled.
 Aurelia marched over, remembering how difficult it had been to strike Harruq and how strong a blow he could take without showing pain.
 ‚ÄúAre you as strong as a half-orc?‚Äù she asked.
 Her staff collided with his ribs.
 He curled up at the blow, crying out in pain.
 Guess not, she thought.
 A shove put him on his back.
 He pleaded to her, sputtering blood, but she ignored him.
 ‚ÄúSome people should not reproduce,‚Äù she said.
 Down came her staff, all her might behind it.

I finally settled on a white button-up, and headed to the bathroom so I could change.
 "So are you going to tell me what the differences are, or is that part of the stuff I'm not allowed to know?"
 Alec's chuckle was muffled by the closed door, but still brought a smile to my face.
 "The biggest difference will be that we're going to have to shuffle some class schedules to make sure Brandon and his pack don't have access to you or Rachel.
 Everything else is just kind of a corollary to that.
 At least one pack member will need to be with you whenever you leave the house."
 I spit out the toothpaste currently prohibiting me from being able to respond, and swung the door open.
 "Alec, it's the middle of the semester.
 We can't just walk into the office and tell them we want to change our schedules.
 It doesn't work that way."

The sound of 'One Day More' playing on the cell phone nestled in the closest bouquet had been what finally convinced me it was all meant for me.
 Brandon's voice had been like silk caressing my face when I'd answered the phone.
 One minute I was minding my own business trying to pretend like I didn't notice the nasty looks some of Brandon's friends were shooting my way when they thought I wasn't looking, the next I was going to the biggest dance of the year with the most popular guy in school.
 I'd half thought Cassie was going to rip out my throat.
 I walked past a pair of gorgeous, gold-fringed drapes, handed my ticket to a distinguished-looking man in a uniform, and then smiled as he pointed me towards my door.
 It was almost a relief to be around strangers again.
 He'd been polite, but hadn't tried to fawn over me.
 My being asked out had changed my treatment from almost every girl at school.
 Half the student body, the more sensible portion it seemed, had all decided that I was some kind of massively stuck-up slut.
 The other half had decided they needed to be my new best friend if they wanted to get invited to any of the cool parties ever again.

Rodregas threw himself toward the last guard.
 He blocked the sword blow with his borrowed shield but did not have the angle to avoid a direct impact.
 The sword sliced through the shield and Rodregas jerked his arm back fearing that he would lose it.
 Rodregas managed to get in close and, abandoning his useless short sword, grabbed his opponent‚Äôs shield and pulled him in.
 The guard tried to shrug him off, his bearded face looked afraid.
 His eyes, a light blue, stared at Rodregas with revulsion.
 He was probably wondering how Rodregas could be strong enough to take on an Immortal Guard.
 Rodregas knew from the guard‚Äôs fear that he had him, he was not thinking clearly.
 Rodregas growled at him, letting him feel his anger and rage at taking slaves to be used by the Immortalists.
 Rodregas had seen what would happen to them.

‚ÄúJust what I said, would you like to learn to read?‚Äù Rodregas said in a carefully casual voice.
 Doi‚Äôvan responded, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have time for me to learn to read.
 You should spend time practicing with these Grimoires.
 It makes no sense to teach me to read when we are likely to see battle too soon for it to be helpful.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs voice, which was always deep, seemed to have gone down several octaves, such that the earth almost seemed to vibrate.
 Somehow, while the conversation on magic Grimoires had been of interest to him, the idea of learning to read seemed to terrify him.
 Rodregas knew the feeling of wanting something so much that you are afraid to accept it when offered, for fear of failing.
 ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚ÄúI think it might come in handy to have you able to read.
 And if we survive the summer and are holed up here all winter, you might be able to start reading some of these books by then.
 I fear that I am not a very good teacher, but I have managed to teach a few soldiers over the years who wanted to learn.‚Äù At their nod Rodregas added, ‚ÄúAfter our noon meal, let‚Äôs plan on making it book time.
 We don‚Äôt have a decent lamp to read by, so we will have to do it during the day.

Those extra inches had evaporated recently, but of course it couldn't be a cause for celebration.
 When Mom surfaced enough to notice how much weight I'd lost, she worried I was developing an eating disorder.
 She couldn't seem to understand that I hated the new me more than she did.
 Cindi was the skinny one.
 I'd tried to make myself eat enough to fill back out, but I'd had a hard time remembering meals lately.
 It was easier to just cinch my pants up a little and avoid mirrors.
 Even when I did remember, the calories in didn't seem quite able to keep up with the calories my body routinely burned up.
 I guess panic attacks are harder on your system than most people realize.
 My body had already started spiraling down to an attack again, but before I could get too wobbly, I made it inside the house.

And he had all his fingers and all his toes, and he let out a bellow so excruciating it could curdle milk.
 Many changes, challenges and compromises in our marriage would soon follow.
 Many difficult times required me to recall the moment I first saw Lisa.
 A second son, Bryce, was added to our family two years later.
 I have tried to explain to my friends with no children yet that having children changes everything suddenly.
 Every day, sometimes every second, delivers a new challenge.
 As much as they want me to tell them what to expect, I cannot prepare them, as no one could have ever prepared me.
 I have told my friends to imagine driving down a beautiful highway on the way to a vacation spot in the mountains, with all of your plans for the trip clearly in your mind.
 Now imagine that your car‚Äôs emergency brake is unexpectedly pulled‚Äî hard‚Äî your calm drive is suddenly spinning out of control.
 You don‚Äôt know which way to turn the wheel or what pedal to push.

On my own, I won't propose anything about the after-life.
 Observing and attempting to grasp this life is enough of a challenge.
 But God will make justice come about somewhere, somehow.
 Of that much I'm convinced.
 Sylvia used to divide humanity into people of good will and the others.
 I‚Äôll use her term and ask, how could any person of good will, when confronted with plenty of evidence, circumstantial though it may be, refuse to at least hope for a God who with mercy resolves all the horrors of life here and now and makes justice happen in a golden and joyous eternity?
 So be it.
 These Days

 I wasn't any less shocked, but his tone was so apologetic I couldn't help but smile.
 "That's better; I much prefer the happy Adri face to the scared Adri."
 "Wait, you could see me smile?
 I guess that all follows, better hearing, better sense of smell.
 Of course you'd have better vision too."
 It wasn't until I heard the note of longing in my voice that I realized what I was missing.
 Alec didn't have that same advantage, and I could feel him waiting expectantly.
 "Sorry, it's just that this all makes me think of these amazing dreams I've been having since I arrived.

Before launching new initiatives, governments should conduct public inquiries and debate alternative packages of policies and practices.
 The inquiry should realistically access the expected costs and benefits of each package.
 After educating the public about the need for choice and the necessary costs involved, the final selection of the most accept able package should be made by the people themselves through a national referendum.
 2.Establish macro-economic stability: The errors in earlier efforts at adjustment and stabilization have led some to argue for a series of compromise programmes that do not seriously ad dress the imminent dangers of hyperinflation and economic collapse.
 No transition strategy can be successful without first creating stable conditions for economic growth.
 No effort to improve agricultural production or the availability of food will be successful so long as the currency is not accepted as a stable means of exchange.
 This is the ultimate justification for the insistence of the international lending community on harsh measures to stabilize the economy.
 If the previous stabilization programmes have not proved politically viable, socially acceptable or economically effective, alternative programmes similar to the Yugoslav strategy must be attempted without further delay, backed by the full commitment of government.
 In some cases, it may be necessary to temporarily reintroduce controls on wages and prices as an interim measure to stop the free fall of the currency.
 But whatever the method, it is essential that this effort be combined with simultaneous implementation of other essential policies.

Yet, as in the past, our vision of these opportunities is obstructed by conceptions and attitudes inherited from a bygone era.
 To fully appreciate the emerging opportunities, we need to more clearly comprehend the events of the past two decades that are the seeds from which these opportunities spring.
 Restructuring the UN
 The formation of the International Commission on Peace & Food was conceived in 1987, a time when mutual suspicions, escalating military expenditure and confrontational Cold War rhetoric blinded the world to the possibility of radically transforming the global security environment.
 Yet, fuelled by the bold initiatives of Mikhail Gorbachev, by the time ICPF conducted its first meeting on the border of the rapidly vanishing Iron Curtain at Trieste in September 1989, the Berlin Wall had fallen, Cold War hostilities had melted, and the prospect of ushering in a more peaceful and prosperous world for all seemed within reach.
 The euphoria of those heady days generated high expectations of a peace dividend that would help to wipe away much of the world‚Äôs suffering.
 At the same time, the withdrawal of the confrontation between East and West resulted in a gradual shift of attention from the threat of imminent global self-destruction to lesser but very real problems, among them ‚Äì the unresolved danger arising from huge stockpiles of nuclear weapons; some 26 on-going localized military conflicts within and between developing nations, aggravated by increased trafficking in small armaments; the persistence of hunger and malnutrition, especially among the poorest populations of South Asia and politically unstable regions of Africa; progressively rising levels of unemployment in both industrialized and developing countries; and the turbulence and hardship of political, economic and social transition in post-Communist Eastern Europe.
 These challenges, coupled with the outbreak of the first Gulf War, the disintegration of Yugoslavia, and the horrendous civil wars that wracked Somalia and Rwanda, clouded the world‚Äôs vision of a brighter future.
 It was in this context that the Commission undertook five years of research that led to the publication of its report in the fall of 1994.
 The report was released at official functions at UN headquarters in New York, UNESCO in Paris, a global congress of the World Academy of Art and Science at Minneapolis, and in the restored capital of a reunited Germany at Berlin, then formally presented to the UN Secretary General and to all UN member nations by a member of the Commission, Her Majesty Queen Noor on behalf of the Government of Jordan.

"I don't know about all of that, but thanks for the lift just now."
 I fumbled for a minute with the unfamiliar latch, and then invited the blistering heat into the cool interior of the car as I swung the door open.
 Brandon gently captured my arm before I could slide out of the passenger seat.
 "You'll wait for me tomorrow?"
 "I don't know--maybe.
 Anyone that thinks Minnesota is the east instead of the Midwest can't really be relied upon to remember important things like appointments."
 I could feel myself blushing again as I pulled free and fled into the house with a single wave goodbye.
 Normally I wasn't flirtatious.
 Heck, I hardly knew the meaning of the word, but something about Brandon turned it all into a harmless game.
 A game with rules that were nearly comprehensible for a change.

"Well, I suppose I'd better get you off to bed."
 The words initially didn't mean anything to me.
 I heard them, but my mind refused to assign meanings to the sounds.
 It wasn't until he'd moved his arm and rolled out of bed with his characteristic speed and grace that I finally realized he meant to take me to the Lilac Room and then return here to sleep.
 I suddenly had a hard time breathing.
 The idea of lying alone in the dark, in the very room I'd just seen Brandon demolish, sent my heart into an erratic rhythm.
 If there'd been an EMT present they'd have already been charging up the defibrillator.
 Alec turned around while I was still trying to get my throat to work again.
 "You stopped breathing.

 I turned the door knob and walked into the kitchen.
 My mom and dad were sitting in the living room looking extremely excited.
 Before I even had a chance to say hi, my mom jumped up and rushed over to me.
 ‚ÄúYou never told us that you applied for a summer camp!‚Äù my mom squealed happily.
 ‚ÄúYou also didn‚Äôt tell us that you were to be picked from the best.

 ‚ÄúOf this size, yes,‚Äù Qurrah answered.

Good enough for the common soldier, but I fancy something a little more distinctive.‚Äù Rodregas was about to ask him what he had in mind when they found out why they had been waiting; two more slavers came up with drawn bows.
 They were going to take them from a safe distance.
 Doi‚Äôvan and he needed no words; they both knew only instant action gave them a chance.
 Rodregas would like to have tried to take on one of the Immortal Guards, but he had already noticed that the slaver with the mace was a little too close and a little too far away from his nearest companion.
 He was a skinny man with dirty hair and seemed to be having trouble holding his heavy weapon.
 Rodregas stepped in close and the slaver swung the mace with surprising force, but he met it with the shield and knocked it aside.
 Rodregas moved with simply too much speed to be blocked.
 He slid the short sword into the slaver‚Äôs stomach and gutted him in a quick and vicious move.
 Doi‚Äôvan immediately launched himself at the next slaver, and followed suit, slamming his opponent‚Äôs sword away and gutting him before he had a chance to move.
 Rodregas then went for the nearest Immortal Guard.

 Hmmm .

 he would have thought that most 22 year olds in the 1920s would be married.
 Especially a girl as beautiful as this one.
 But Tranton was her family name, so she apparently wasn‚Äôt.
 Scanning the text on the page opposite the picture, he found a little information about her.
 She‚Äôd gotten married at 23‚Äîa year after the picture had been taken.
 And she‚Äôd died in 1941.

"Go away!"
 The command was so forceful it was almost more than I could do to stop myself from turning and running away in terror, but I held my ground.
 "Leave.
 Leave now and I won't follow you."
 The anger was still there, but now there were other emotions, one of which I could identify, one of which I knew how to handle.
 "It was you the whole time, wasn't it?

Their future begins to enter my mind and I hope and pray that I will see Brandon free from his addiction one day and see Bryce graduate college.
 Who will they marry one day, how many children will they have, will I be a grandpa or a memory?
 Too many thoughts are packed in my head as I realize this is my life and my family‚Äôs life passing before me as the moment of truth approaches.
 Perhaps all this worrying is for nothing or perhaps the worst is about to happen.
 I must cleanse my mind of this sudden bombardment of thoughts and I must focus!
 I pull into the parking lot of the Starbucks just as my crack-berry rings.
 I see Ashley standing inside the coffee shop with her cell phone up to her ear.
 I answer the phone as I notice a space directly facing the front door of Starbucks is opening up as a car begins to back out.
 She asks me where I am and I tell her I am looking at her from in the truck waiting for that front spot to open.
 She sees me, and as we talk I can see her lips move slightly ahead of the sound of her voice.

Jessica is pretty much the most submissive, not by temperament, but because she's the weakest fighter we've got."
 I felt my eyes go wide at all the new terms, but kept my mouth shut because I was worried Rachel would clam up if I started asking questions.
 "I'm pretty sure Alec could take two of them, but not all three.
 They knew that, which was part of the reason they were pushing so hard."
 I felt shivers crawl up my spine, but what could someone say after something like that?
 Rachel reached over and gave me a hug.
 "Try not to think about it too much.
 Just remember that Alec's dominant to everyone here, and he'd die for either of us without even a heartbeat's worth of hesitation."
 After Rachel left I spent the next hour trying to get comfortable in Alec's desk chair.
 It was likely the discomfort was more due to the subject matter than the chair, but I just couldn't get comfortable.

"Leave her alone."
 For a second I thought Cassie would go through with it.
 Her knuckles went white, and her breathing sped up.
 I knew if she sprang at me, I was going to get really hurt.
 When Brandon's hand appeared on Cassie's shoulder to restrain her, I thought for a second my knees would buckle.
 A few seconds later, it was as if nothing had ever happened.
 The ring of spectators dissolved as kids quickly returned to their tables.
 Brandon and his friends left through one set of cafeteria doors, while Alec and his friends departed through the other.
 Britney looked like she was trying to decide whether to be mad or impressed, but I felt too sick to stick around and try to nudge her in either direction.
 I mumbled something I hoped sounded intelligible and headed towards the bathroom.

 She felt a little anxious as she walked into her house.
 She wanted Rick to hold her, to caress her hair and kiss her temple and whisper that he loved her.
 But she'd never have that again.
 When she'd chosen to return home, she'd given him up forever.
 She managed to hold herself together until she was in her room.
 Then she burst into tears.

The shelves held bones and bowls of strange fluids and other items whose uses he could not imagine.
 Anything that felt foul he threw into the fireplace, after getting a good flame going.
 Several books and strange containers ended up in the fire, though he did find two books that felt of magic that he kept.
 He also found a small statue of a strange green mechanical frog that had that magic tingle to it.
 He could not imagine its use; it appeared a simple toy, but he put it in his pile to take.
 There was a heavy oak cabinet in the corner which he forced open.
 Inside were large pottery containers, which he had seen before.
 They held some of the magic powders used to make the circles that were so important to many of the most powerful of the Immortalist‚Äôs spells.
 He checked the powders for magic and several came off very strong so he added them to the pile.
 Two came off with the foulest feel yet, even worse than the books in the studio.

I had to look around the room twice before I finally spotted the speakers to the system.
 They were built into the walls and ceiling, and based on their number and varying sizes I had a sneaking suspicion they'd produce nearly as much volume as the monsters professional DJs brought to dances.
 Based on the amount of money involved in setting up such a system in the first place, they probably cranked all that out without even the slightest hint of distortion.
 As impressive as the stereo no doubt was, it was all of those shelves filled with books that finally pulled me off of the bed and onto the incredibly lush, maroon carpet.
 Emerson, Ayn Rand, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy were all present.
 Whoever lived here was either incredibly well read, or a complete poser who bought books just for show.
 Almost scared to find out which it was, I reached over and pulled out the copy of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and opened it up to find a well-cared-for book that'd still obviously been read several times.
 I carefully slid the book back into its spot and then noticed the faintest glimmer of light coming from an open doorway off to my right.
 It was an art gallery.
 One covered in pictures that were eerily familiar, all with a circular signature at the bottom right hand corner.

I told her this because I needed to set some restrictive boundaries; I knew I would need to work within the confines of the narcotics officers, and this would allow me to put her off, buy some time, if I needed it.
 She talked with me and continued to massage my chest as she straddled my naked body.
 She reached for my hands and placed them on her young firm breasts.
 It was an unexpected treat for ‚Äúan old guy with a script‚Äù.
 I‚Äôll let you use your imagination from there, but she finished her massage and then we both got dressed.
 The fish was in the net.
 The girl, Ashley, had taken the bait, and I felt confident that I had the deal working.
 Now I would need to go home and hope my wife‚Äôs level of understanding would allow me to be completely honest with her about what I was doing, and what I had just done.
 I knew Lisa wanted to help Brandon and we both knew my involvement would require a venture into unchartered territory but I needed her to know everything.
 Lisa and I had been married for twenty-four years and we knew what lay ahead would be a bigger test of our commitment than what I had just done.

The instant before he struck, Steed ducked into a squat and spun, taking Grey‚Äôs legs out from under him.
 I flinched.
 Grey was gone again, this time reappearing midair in a flip above Steed‚Äôs head, reaching down to tag him on the way by.
 It was a loud smack.
 I was sure it had stung.
 Steed stood still, focused on the spot where Grey had landed and was flickering in and out of view.
 I made an effort to consider possible responses in my head, but was coming up blank.
 The nerves were gone.
 I found myself wanting Steed to win and leaned with his strikes, tensing as if they were my own.

Whatever the reason, her smile took on new intensity, and she slowly reached out and clasped my hand again.
 "I'm sorry; I spend so much of my time alone with my thoughts that they develop well-worn grooves.
 I forget sometimes that other people haven't been privy to the endless hours of speculation that got me from one point to another."
 There was something about her touch that distracted me.
 Not in a bad way, almost like the tickle you get in the back of your mind when you know you're missing out on some key point of plot in a suspense novel.
 "You glow much more brightly than any human I've ever met, but you don't feel like a shape shifter, so you're either a very powerful Fir'shan, one strong enough to mask your nature from Alec, as well as me, or you're a very extraordinary human.
 Alec wouldn't have brought you here until he was sure it was the latter."
 I closed my mouth in astonishment.
 "I didn't realize Alec had talked to anyone about me.
 Actually I think you just let more drop in a few sentences than he's told me all week.

Acceptance must be fostered through education and discussion rather than unilateral forced initiative.
 Preventive Diplomacy, Peace Making and Peace Building
 The answers to the questions regarding national sovereignty and international responsibility will determine the scope of UN preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace building in years to come.
 They must be addressed with a view to evolving valid principles of international law, rather than remaining subject to frequent reversals of public policy by member states based on the short-term impact of the media on current public opinion.
 Granted that a consensus is reached regarding these larger issues of principle, there still will remain immense problems relating to implementation, as illustrated by the recent failure of international intervention in Somalia.
 Whatever may be the limits placed on the UN‚Äôs mandate for action, it is clear that it cannot carry out that mandate effectively under the current constraints imposed on it by member states through indecisiveness, narrowly defined interests and lack of political commitment.
 Once again the inherent weaknesses in the structure of the UN organization impact negatively on its capacity to perform the tasks rightfully allotted to it.
 The absence of a unified chain of command for national forces placed under UN command ‚Äì culminating in the outright refusal of field forces to follow the commands of UN field staff, inadequate training and equipping of both military staff and fighting units, poor coordination between field units from different countries and between member states and UN headquarters ‚Äì and a failure to vest sufficient authority in the UN Secretary General are among the most blatant weaknesses of the present system.
 Substantive measures are needed to strengthen the UN‚Äôs capabilities to handle crises.
 First and foremost, the position of the Secretary General, who now has the diplomatic status equal to that of a prime minister of a member state, should be upgraded to that of a head of state, with full authority over the forces placed under his command by member states to carry out the decisions of the Security Council.

When my boys were in grammar school, our neighbor asked me who the man was who came to our home during the day while we were at work.
 He said that this guy, sometimes with another man, would enter our house through the garage with the keypad code.
 We knew nothing of this!
 The neighbor described the car, and the description matched Thomas‚Äôs car.
 I showed him a family photo and he identified Thomas as the guy.
 When I searched my house I found liquid Hydrocodone prescribed for horses.
 Thomas had been using my house as his daytime drug den.
 When I confronted him, he denied it, and even went so far as to blame Brandon and Bryce.
 He threw his nephews under the bus to cover his ass.

 Chevelle‚Äôs head jerked toward me and I couldn‚Äôt catch my breath‚Äîhis eyes were as black as onyx.
 When his focus returned to the men, they eased away, the first supporting other by an arm as both bowed slightly, stepping and stumbling in their retreat.
 Chevelle watched them until they spun to disappear, and then he turned to me.
 One look at his face and I knew the cause of the devastation.

Qurrah ducked back around, cursed his brother, and then darted to the nearest home.
 The first one had locks, as did the second, but the third was unbarred.

God fills the vacuum.
 One of her warm hands touched mine and the other pressed my forehead.
 She smiled as poignantly as though I were her son, and her greatness revealed itself instantly.
 Because I realized that although she earned a Nobel prize and is frequently called a living Saint, she considers herself no better than me.
 Talk about humility.
 The Commandment
 A song reminds me of 1 John 3:23, ‚ÄúThis is his commandment, to believe in the name of his son, Jesus, and to love one another as he commanded us.‚Äù Again I think about the power of a single word to change us, and redirect our lives, and perhaps give us the ability to change others and the world.
 But I suspect it‚Äôs not likely to do so unless we stop and wrestle with its meanings.
 In an essay on writing short stories, Andre Dubus advised that when we get stuck, instead of stopping or attempting to go forward, we should try going deeper.
 On this trip, I have attempted to deepen my understanding of the word ‚Äúadore.‚Äù Now I‚Äôm trying to do the same with some words in John‚Äôs admonition, because I feel my mind or the Spirit telling me that everything we need to know to live in goodness and beauty may be contained in those few lines.

There was no way they would have been taken.
 There were standing orders to kill anyone who tried to remove them.
 Rodregas was not a very good bowman, but he was definitely going to try to bring them with him.
 He peeked out of the main doors and looked around the open keep.
 The stables were to the left and the gate was to the right.
 The courtyard was not large.
 He could not see anyone, but he knew there would be at least two guards left: one at the gate and one in the watchtower over the gate.
 In front of the stable was a large bony horse, dappled in brown and white.
 Rodregas thought her name was Tory or Torin, he could not remember which.
 She was an older horse, in her early twenties, and was known for her mild manor.

He had attended our high school and he was the quarterback of the football team (my polar opposite).
 She had only come to the club the night I met her because she was angry with her boyfriend because he choose to spend Valentine‚Äôs Day with his brother playing basketball (take notes boys).
 She had called a friend who told her she could get her into this bar because she knew the bartender and they were both under legal drinking age.
 Lisa was 20.
 She was a ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù and hadn‚Äôt ever done anything like that.
 She had no intention of breaking up with her boyfriend.
 I looked her square in her beautiful blue eyes and I told her flatly, ‚ÄúYou are going to fall so in love with me that you will not even remember this guy‚Äôs name!‚Äù We were married three years later.
 After all the years we have been married, I still think of that moment I saw her walk into that bar whenever we are having a tough time.

It was Jim Dickinson who dubbed Buddy ‚ÄúSlipshod,‚Äù not because Buddy was a sloppy player but because he put together such sloppy groups around him.
 It mattered not to Buddy who was playing behind him.
 He was lost in the ether, playing for his own private gods, letting the Lydian reverberation carry him away, the sound coming from his own self, you see.
 Oh, of course, he knew when the bassist was faking it, or the drummer tripping over himself to keep up, or the rhythm guitarist playing the same three chords over and over, hoping his stroking would be lost in the thunder.
 Buddy knew it, but he didn‚Äôt care.
 He was soaring.
 He was making music, Memphis music, as sacred a calling as one could imagine.
 Eventually, Buddy found his grounding, a group almost as flexuous and capable as Buddy, though few could approach Buddy‚Äôs genius for the ineffable, that secret other place he could go with his music.
 Black Lung was born in the mid-sixties in an abandoned gas station when a bass player named Crafty Connor was introduced to Buddy through the coagulant Sid Selvidge.
 Memphis music bred Memphis music, is how Sid describes it today.

He had learned from Imeralda a new spell to make light; he waved his hands,  mumbled the incantation, and then threw all his power, and sent it straight at Van‚Äôdret in a stream of energy that felt like a river of lava flowing from his hands.
 In fact there was not so much as a flicker of light.
 Rodregas lacked the discipline to channel the power.
 Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs senses were acute on things arcane and he felt the coming flood of power as if it was a real physical thing.
 Van‚Äôdret spread his hands and made a frantic move that sent a corona of power around him.
 Of course no focused magic came near him, and what did occur startled even Rodregas.
 Imeralda was literally flying through the air and she had her dagger drawn.
 She did not land smoothly, colliding into Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs lower body, but she instantly straightened and thrust her dagger into Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs stomach.
 The dagger did not sink far; a few inches.
 Rodregas expected Van‚Äôdret to get his hands up and fend her off, but he seemed to be in shock.

Mom's jewelry box had somehow got packed into a box labeled 'old photography gear'.
 As I pulled it out to set it to one side, it slipped from my hands.
 The glittering deluge of chains and bracelets that went sliding across the floor would have made me feel bad enough all by themselves, but there was a proverbial scorpion nestled in the midst of all that shininess.
 I'd thrown mine out shortly after the accident.
 Part of me hadn't wanted to.
 It had felt like I was abandoning Cindi by doing so, but just seeing Cindi's half of the twin pendants we'd received two years before had been enough to send me into a tailspin.
 A detached part of me noted that it was just like Mom to have lied about having lost Cindi's.
 She'd known I couldn't handle the reminder of what we'd lost, but she'd been unwilling to give up that link to the past.
 The thought slipped away like sunlight skipping across water a split second before the storm arrived.
 The attack was a bad one.

 ‚ÄúWe should stop for breakfast,‚Äù Chevelle said.
 We hadn‚Äôt been riding long, but it wasn‚Äôt a suggestion.
 I didn‚Äôt mind; I‚Äôd eaten mostly berries for days and I wasn‚Äôt quite sure about riding yet.
 ‚ÄúI suppose you‚Äôre right.
 Might as well enjoy the journey,‚Äù Steed said, throwing me a private grin.
 We stopped under the canopy of a red oak and Steed grabbed me as I slid awkwardly from the horse.
 ‚ÄúYou may ask him to kneel, Elfreda.‚Äù Not that he appeared to mind handling me about the waist to help me down.
 Looking up at him, I pushed the hair away from my face.

My mother was also left bearing the responsibility of a huge IRS tax lien and a mountain of bills.
 Mom and 11-year-old Harry were losing everything to the IRS, and it was just a matter of time before they were broke and homeless.
 I went home to help her; after all, I had nowhere else to be.
 Chapter 10: A Vision Appears There is such a thing as love at first sight, and I know because it happened to me.
 Valentine‚Äôs Day, 1981, I decided to go to this local pick-up joint with Bill and hang with the rest of the hounds.
 This club, called ‚ÄúThe Phone Company,‚Äù had phones on every table surrounding a dance floor.
 Each table had a number posted on a short pole that protruded above the phone.
 Pick up the phone at any table, dial the two digit number of the table you wanted to connect with and there you have it: a coward‚Äôs way of asking a lady to dance or talk without getting shot down tableside.
 What can I say?
 This was the style at the time.

I didn‚Äôt want him to hate me.
 Ruby whirled into the room and grabbed me around the waist from behind, spinning me up, over the back of the seat, and through her door before I could process what was happening.
 She plopped me down in the center of her bed and swung around to sit in front of me.
 My head was reeling from the spin as she smiled at me, waving her hands and bringing a plethora of bottles and canisters flying toward us to drop on the bed.
 I thought with disappointment that I hadn‚Äôt responded to her attack as Chevelle had taught me and laughed at the image in my head.
 Ruby gave me a genuine smile as she began twisting the lid on a small metal canister.
 ‚ÄúNo mother to teach us the tricks of the trade,‚Äù she sighed as she leaned in.
 I jerked away from her, wanting to be angry about the comment.
 But Ruby had just told me her own story, no less tragic.
 She mistook my reaction.

 He gazed at her for a moment.
 "I love you, Marie.
 And if you'd stay here with me, I'd promise you that I would never, ever touch another woman."
 His words filled her with anguish.
 She could have him, but only if she stayed here.
 And she couldn't do that.
 She had to go home.

 A small silver dagger appeared in her hands.
 Harruq eyed it warily.
 ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that for?‚Äù he asked.

 The half-orc shrugged, for some reason embarrassed.

She smiled, raising her lips to his for a brief kiss.
 As she wandered off, Rick focused his mind on the TV shows they'd watched last night.
 He replayed all the details of the plots, being sure that he saw, in his mind's eye, all the colors.
 Then he began thinking about planes, remembering his trip with Marie to Los Angeles.
 Then he thought about all the computer programs he used and how to troubleshoot them.
 He'd just started listing microwave products in his mind when Marie returned.
 He rose and went to hug her.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, immediately kicking himself for his hypocrisy.
 She sighed, letting herself be comforted by his embrace.
 August was just around the corner now, and she and her mother normally spent August at Cape Cod.

 Chapter 1 Stepping back out into the relentless desert sun, I once again wished we were still back in Minnesota, or at least that we were done moving.
 Then again I might as well have been wishing that Mom had decided on somewhere other than Utah, or that we'd had some long-lost relative die and leave us a small fortune, or even better that Dad and Cindi...
 The thought was much too dangerous to complete.
 My breathing had already sped up, and my balance degenerated so quickly it was a small miracle I made it over to the U-Haul before I keeled over.
 I'd hated the battered vehicle that had spent the last two days carrying us west across I-80.

‚ÄúI mean, yes, I would like to learn what you can teach me.
 I like to learn,‚Äù he said slowly but carefully.
 The big guy was embarrassed.
 Then he added, ‚ÄúI am afraid my people are not big readers, and, well, they saw me as half-monster and I never learned how to read.‚Äù The last words he added very slowly, but then quickly added, ‚ÄúBut if you can teach me some basics from the oral techniques that Imeralda mentioned, I would like to learn some magic if I can.‚Äù Rodregas looked at Doi‚Äôvan; there was something about his expression, a yearning.
 ‚ÄúDo you want to learn to read?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan asked, stepping away from the other two like he was uncomfortable.
 ‚ÄúJust what I said, would you like to learn to read?‚Äù Rodregas said in a carefully casual voice.
 Doi‚Äôvan responded, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have time for me to learn to read.
 You should spend time practicing with these Grimoires.
 It makes no sense to teach me to read when we are likely to see battle too soon for it to be helpful.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs voice, which was always deep, seemed to have gone down several octaves, such that the earth almost seemed to vibrate.

 ‚ÄúSteed was certainly enjoying it, but, my dear, he won‚Äôt spill the secret to me.

 There was nowhere to go, it was too much, and it turned to fury as she continued.

 She laughed and tossed her head.

He didn't feel like going out.
 His wheelchair-bound friend went anyway.
 The phone rang late that night with the unbelievable news of another car accident.
 This time Tom‚Äôs paralyzed body was thrown through the window and he tumbled down the highway to his death.
 Brandon was inconsolable.
 His best friend was dead.
 Brandon blamed himself for not being there to take care of Tom.
 One of Brandon‚Äôs confessions during rehab was that almost all of his friends decided to get as high as they could to attend Tom‚Äôs funeral.
 It was the beginning of his excessive drug abuse.
 Chapter 24: Let The Healing Begin As Brandon approached his fifth month as a student at Narconon, he called us and told us he was nearing graduation from the program.

My silence seemed to leave my new friend at a loss for words.
 I guess she was used to people agreeing with everything she said.
 I didn't like to lie though, so when I didn't agree with someone I tended not to say anything.
 I guess I didn't think my new task was as unreasonable as it'd first appeared?

All she knew was that she wanted more of Rick--more of his kisses and his touches.
 She felt like she couldn't get enough.
 All at once she realized that getting enough meant making love.

 Rick wasn't her husband.
 And he never would be.

Harruq shrugged, deciding his ability to pick kindly people wasn‚Äôt very impressive.
 He tried again, this time with a tired man trudging down the street.
 ‚ÄúNever heard of her,‚Äù the man said.
 A few more unsuccessful attempts sent Harruq away from Singhelm and further into Celed.
 There the reception toward him took a significant turn for the worse.
 Many refused to meet his eye or acknowledge his question.
 The half-orc‚Äôs frustration grew.
 ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it,‚Äù he muttered to himself.

Everyone stepped back a little further.
 I hobbled up a stair or two in an effort to avoid getting in the way.
 I'd heard of tension so thick you could cut it with a knife, but this was the first time I'd ever experienced it.
 It felt like there was electricity surging back and forth between Vincent and Isaac, making my skin feel too small.
 The tension suddenly flickered like a dying light bulb.
 "Vincent!"
 I was disoriented for a second.
 The yell had come from behind me, and had torn the two apart faster than I'd believed possible.
 The crowd, packed so tightly that I'd been worried someone was going to get pushed over the railing, separated as Alec flowed down the stairs.
 I'd only thought Isaac and Vincent were graceful.

This was even better since the goal was to get him and she was ancillary.
 I picked up the phone, which was still connected to the recording device, and she introduced herself and said she was calling from her boyfriend‚Äôs phone because hers was broken.
 The call went better than expected as you could hear Steve coaching her in the background.
 Ashley fell nicely into all of the comments the police wanted to record.
 I was told by Officer White to tell her I could meet her in a couple of days as I was out of town.
 I told her I would call her when I returned and after work hours.
 She agreed and the call ended.
 At the time, I didn‚Äôt understand why we didn‚Äôt just go do the deal right away, but the cops needed to get a crew together and do all this planning for the bust.
 Once this part of the deal was confirmed, the officer left the room and returned with a stack of documents for me to sign.
 I didn‚Äôt read much of it because it didn‚Äôt really matter what it said.

The beast froze the first few into harmless ice cubes but finally went down when one got past its defenses.
 Behind his body appeared seven Thrashers and many more Frost beasts.
 It was like a monster reunion.
 I‚Äôve never seen so many in one place before.
 A Thrasher pack had at least six or seven but there must have been more than ten monsters total.
 It was scary.
 Right then, right at that very moment, I knew something was terribly wrong.
 They all stopped in front of us, all those pairs of angry eyes staring at us.
 They made me confused, from the warm feeling the Frost Beasts gave me to the cold feeling the Thrashers inflicted.
 They exchanged some sort of signal, including grunts and yips, and slowly advanced on us.

They were still bickering.
 I felt something on my hand and I looked down.
 Seth had wound his fingers in mine.
 His touch was gentle and cool, kind of reassuring.
 My mind blanked.
 I was holding hands with Seth.
 I never thought that would happen.
 Seth smiled sheepishly.
 ‚ÄúJazell, you should just relax.
 Let them bicker all they want; we don't have to be a part of it.

By late afternoon, our path opened to look down on the village nestled in the rocks of a narrow valley ahead.
 Chevelle stopped on a ridge to allow us a better view.
 I didn‚Äôt think I would have called it a village‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt count the structures from our vantage point but it must have been ten times the size of home.
 The buildings were the dull stone of the mountain.
 None were trees.
 There was really no vegetation at all, no greens, no browns.
 The entire layout was dark, ashen stones and aged wood that seemed to melt right in to the blue-gray of the mountain.
 The cloudy mist filtered the sun.
 I decided it was beautiful.

They seemed to understand and she bounded back over to me and drew me to sit beside her on a large rock facing the men before cueing them to begin.
 The largest stepped forward, boasting deep brown hair and eyes.
 He wore plain clothing but his broad shoulders and massive size made him seem regal.
 ‚ÄúThey name me Anvil but I am Reed, of Keithar Peak.‚Äù His voice was thick, though it was impossible to tell whether it was an accent or he had difficulty speaking.
 He was huge, frighteningly so, but something about him drew me in.
 I wanted to be his friend for no reason I could rationalize.
 He walked to me and reached out his hand in greeting.
 As I took it in mine, a tingle ran up my arm, the fine hairs standing on end.
 Anvil smiled.

 He noticed my open mouth, blank expression, and sat again, eyeing me questioningly, all humor gone.

 He chuckled.

The elders were frantic, which only frightened me more.
 I had never seen them agitated.
 This carried on for hours.
 My hair and clothing were drenched in sweat and I was near surrender.
 And then, with no more warning than when the first pains came, it was over.
 A small, sweet child was in my arms.
 I drew in ragged breaths as I cleaned her face.
 I wiped her eyes and they came open, an unbelievable shade of dark green, sparkling like emeralds.
 She was a beauty.
 I wasn‚Äôt aware the room had grown silent until I wiped her ears and heard my own gasp.

 I looked up the hill to see a bunch of faery jerks running down the hill towards us.
 Emily stood in front of Jason and raised her hands.
 I notched an arrow and aimed.
 Dust kicked up everywhere as I aimed blindly.

It was the ultimate act of chivalry.
 I more or less floated through my last two classes.
 It wasn't until I finally got to tutoring that I started to put more stock in the idea that Rachel had simply chosen not to go to Les Mis√©rables.
 She looked up, and then away guiltily as I walked in.
 There wasn't a trace of smile or greeting on her face, an abnormality that hit me hard somewhere in the region of my stomach.
 Albert stopped by to say hi, and I used his presence as a distraction.
 "It sounds like you're almost caught up."
 "Yeah, finally.
 I've got another two weeks or so, but then I'll be all done with this whole triple math homework garbage."
 Albert smiled, and for the first time I noticed how genuine his expressions were.

 He was still smiling as he hung up.

I was saved from dealing with her response by Brandon's knock.
 "Hello, Adriana, Mrs.
 Paige."
 I never thought I'd see the like.
 Mom's face lost its stern 'I'm doing this for your own good' look, and instead transformed into something not very different from what I saw every time I watched the girls my age look at Brandon.
 "Well, hello.
 You're Brandon?"
 ** Fifteen minutes later, I was still trying to believe things had gone so well.
 I'd expected Mom to put her foot down and tell Brandon I'd be riding the bus to school every morning, starting today.
 Instead, she'd shaken Brandon's hand, smiled way more than usual, and hurried us out the door so we wouldn't be late for school.

I can't ask them to run that gauntlet carrying you the whole way."
 I ran my finger along his cheek, mirroring the motion he'd done to me so many times.
 "Then don't ask them.
 You'll either win, in which case it doesn't matter whether I'm there or not, or else I don't care what happens."
 Both fists were knotted now, and unless I was very much mistaken, there was just the barest hint of a shake there as well.
 "Don't be ridiculous, Adri.
 You should know at least a little by now what they're capable of.
 I can't let you expose yourself to the kinds of things Vincent or Brandon would...it's out of the question."
 Mom had always gone on and on about how nurturing I was.
 When she was less happy with me, she tended to focus more on just how stubborn I could be.

Seth swung his sword at the back of the snake but there was a flash and it sliced his arm instead.
 He winced and dropped his weapon.
 The snake had wrapped around his neck and was squeezing.

 ‚ÄúI wouldn't do that if I were you,‚Äù it said.
 ‚ÄúThat wouldn't be wise.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I demanded.

The small gray bird on the lip of the library window.
 For a fraction of a second I had been there, in that bird before I dropped it.
 I hadn‚Äôt realized.
 The moment had seemed insignificant in the course of things.
 I laughed at myself as it dawned on me that I probably could have simply made it stop singing.
 And the frog that had exploded on my white gown‚ÄîI had been there for a mere instant.
 Their minds were so small, so simple, it was like nothing.
 The horse was different.
 It was watching for predators, concentrating on the path, its steps, carrying a load.
 I tried to find another animal to experiment on.

And Debbie, well, she was just so young and lovely.
 The first time she took my cock out was in her backyard, leaning against her house, her mother moving around in the kitchen right over our heads‚Äîthis is what you did back then.
 Were parents oblivious?
 I don‚Äôt know.
 Anyway, she takes it out---and this is like the first time either of us has bared anything except our souls and she was just fascinated with it.
 And I don‚Äôt know where this knowledge comes from but she knew immediately how to do what needed to be done.
 She was jerking on me so expertly‚Äîwell, hell, maybe anything feels right the first time‚Äîand, very quickly‚ÄîI was young---I squirted all over both of us.
 It was a surprise.
 I don‚Äôt know what she expected to happen but there was this like fountain, as if I had stored it up for a decade, and there was some on her hand, her forearm, her shirt.

So Bob and I dropped out of college after one semester, even though we risked getting drafted and sent to war.
 We pooled our money, bought an old Chevy, and pulled on to Highway 80.
 By New Orleans, we were low on money, and after one night in that town where we eighteen-year-olds could legally drink, we were broke.
 We slept in our car near a park on the far side of a rundown neighborhood from the French Quarter.
 For food and spending money, we foraged for soda bottles and redeemed them.
 With my share, I bought just enough beer so the proprietor of a smaller Bourbon Street bar allowed me to remain on a stool from which I admired a certain barmaid.
 She reminded me of Karen Flagstad.
 Not in her looks.
 She was taller and red haired.
 But in her expression, I read the same message I got from Karen‚Äôs sweet face.

We are poised at what can become a turning point in the role of war in human affairs.
 The momentous consequences at stake call for decisive action.
 Historically, war has been a means of territorial expansion and economic conquest that strengthened and enriched the conqueror while draining the energy and diminishing the wealth of the conquered.
 War and economic development co-existed and sometimes complemented each other.
 Technological progress increased defensive and offensive capabilities.
 The demands of war and the associated destruction stimulated greater economic activity and spurred organizational innovation, especially for the benefit of those not directly engaged in the conflict.
 Guns were one of the first products of mass production.
 In the modern era, society has become the principle target and victim of war.
 With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, technology and economic activity in support of fighting forces became an increasingly significant factor.
 As a result, more and more effort was directed at eliminating or crippling the enemy‚Äôs economic and industrial capacity and the ‚Äònational will‚Äô to wage war.

She'd only known Rick a week, but she already trusted him.
 More than she trusted Davis.
 Rick had kept his promise and come home at 5:30 every day, and he'd apologized for trying to kiss her.
 The last time she'd seen Davis, he'd kissed her so hard that her teeth had cut her lips.
 And he certainly hadn't apologized.
 She touched the ring that Davis had put on her left hand, twisting it.
 Could she spend her entire life with a man like that?

The mountains loomed ahead of us and something tingled down my spine.
 Something was going to happen in those mountains, I just knew.
 The sky was clearer here and also more windy.
 The wind tugged at my hair and clothes as I walked.
 I had to keep squinting to see through my hair.
 I felt a tap on my shoulder and I looked over.
 Emily held her hand out.
 ‚ÄúHere Jazell, use this to keep your hair out of your face,‚Äù she opened her hand and dropped something in my palm.
 I held it up.
 It was a thin, vine that was about a foot long.

 Qurrah broke away from his brother when the last died before them.
 He could smell the fear of the villagers, and like a tracking dog he could use it to find where they fled.
 Flames danced across the side of one house, alerting Qurrah.
 The half-orc coiled the whip around his arm and pulled out a scrap of bone from a pouch.
 It was time to test the spells his master had taught him.
 An elderly man came around the corner, a torch his only weapon.
 He glared at Qurrah with unabashed hatred.

At first Harruq did not see who he saluted, but an elf fell from the roof and landed before the soldier.
 ‚ÄúAn elf,‚Äù Harruq whispered, managing to grab Qurrah‚Äôs attention.
 Now both peered around the corner, curious why such an exotic creature had arrived mere seconds before war.
 ‚ÄúGreetings, Dieredon,‚Äù the soldier hailed, pulling off his helmet.
 He was a middle-aged, blond-haired man who had numerous scars on his face.
 ‚ÄúGreetings to you as well, guard captain Antonil,‚Äù Dieredon said, taking a step back and kneeling.
 ‚ÄúThough I fear greetings is all I may offer you.‚Äù
 Antonil pointed to the wall, and he asked something which neither could hear when the orc army shouted another communal roar.
 ‚ÄúThe Ekreissar will not aid you,‚Äù Dieredon said when the noise died.
 He shook his head, and a bit of sadness crossed his face.

Arguments are often advanced that nuclear weapons cannot be ‚Äòdis-invented‚Äô, and that the danger of a rogue state or terrorist group acquiring and threatening use of these weapons necessitates that the present nuclear powers retain them for such a contingency.
 With the massive conventional firepower already available, nuclear weapons are not needed for defence, even against a rogue state with nuclear capability, and they do not represent a credible defence against terrorism under any circumstances.
 How could nuclear weapons conceivably be used to retaliate against terrorism?
 Alternative solutions can be found to address these threats far more effectively.
 Similar arguments were made in the past against complete eradication of chemical weapons.
 The new treaty for the abolition of chemical weapons provides a useful model.
 Chemical weapons technology is far easier to acquire and violations of the treaty are far more difficult to verify.
 The fact that a comprehensive universal treaty to abolish one category of weapons of mass destruction is now a reality proves that political will rather than technical factors is the crucial element.
 The Chemical Weapons Treaty also shows that negotiation of such a treaty need not take decades.
 The demise of the Cold War offers a unique opportunity to eliminate nuclear weapons while the political atmosphere is favourable.

"I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
 If there's a way to keep you safe I'll find it."
 The feel of his breath caressing my cheek sent tingles racing through my entire body, but even that couldn't completely reassure me.
 Still, I gave it my best effort, and if my smile wasn't entirely convincing, it was at least good enough to temporarily reassure Alec.
 I followed him into class, pausing while he handed his note to Mrs. Sorenson.
 It was almost worth all of the craziness and exhaustion of the last seventy-two hours to see her eyebrows rise in astonishment as she read the innocuous piece of paper essentially giving Alec carte blanche in her classroom.
 "This is highly irregular, Mr. Graves.
 In fact I don't believe the administration can legitimately expect me to comply."
 Alec's smile could have been used to sweeten pretty much any beverage you could imagine.

 Blood ran from where Harruq had broken his nose.

 Harruq glanced at Qurrah, who only chuckled louder.

"Still, I'd like to make it up to you."
 He looked down at my ankle and then smiled with a hint of mischievousness.
 "I suppose dancing is out, but I think I've got something that'll do just about as well."
 Alec carefully picked me up before I could respond.
 A few seconds later we were outside, traveling through the darkness with a breakneck speed that would've been suicidal with merely human vision.
 I was completely lost by the time we came around a corner and my inferior eyes were finally able to see the first hints of light up ahead.
 Alec slowed, to prolong the suspense as we got closer.
 Even so, it was only a few more steps before the grotto materialized out of the darkness before us.
 I'd thought it'd been breathtaking two weeks ago bathed in the light of the full moon.
 I'd been amazed at its lush beauty the couple of times I'd snuck back during the daylight.

 She walked away, cast a levitation spell upon herself, and then settled in for sleep hovering an inch above the grass.

The guard, with the speed of his sigil, blocked it.
 But he blocked it sword to sword instead of using the momentum and speed to simply guide the sword away from his body.
 The resulting blow had an unpleasant sound and cut right through Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs sword.
 Unfortunately for the guard, Doi‚Äôvan stepped forward as he swung and jammed the lower half of the sword into his opponent‚Äôs chest.
 The guard flew into the bushes with a sickening crunching sound.
 Rodregas next heard the sound of another of the enemy and spun into the sound using all his speed and strength, hoping to take a guard with either advantage.
 His target proved to be a slaver.
 He had a ragged beard and held a small battle axe.
 Rodregas‚Äô sword blow was too fast for the guard to block and had the strength to stun a guard wearing regulation armor.
 His sword cleaved the guard in half, and a gout of blood and gore splattered him.

 She kept closing her eyes but it didn't seem like a time to sleep.
 She wanted to do something, just to occupy her busy mind.
 She watched a strange creature fly over to her tree and hook itself on a branch near her.
 It looked like a butterfly with only one set of wings, which were transparent and seemed to glow.
 It had a tail and curled around the branch so it could rest its middle.
 Emily watched it and its beauty; she didn't think that something this pretty could be found in a place so dark and full of death.

At the same time another Thrasher was heading in my direction, and by moving out of the way from the first one, I had placed myself in the path of the second one.
 It slammed into my side at such a great force I tasted blood in my mouth, when I hit the ground.
 Then I felt pain, saw blood, and then nothing at all.
 Chapter 4
 I heard muffled voices around me as I regained consciousness.
 My head throbbed slightly, and so did my side and my tongue.
 That explained why I had tasted blood; I must have bitten it.
 For a second I thought I had returned to my human self when I heard a blast of fire that probably came from Emily.
 ‚ÄúSeth when will she wake up?‚Äù a voice said.
 Then I realized it was Emily.

I couldn't care less if Brandon was jealous, and Alec hadn't even kissed me yet.
 Even so, hearing my name said with such disdain by so many different people took its toll over the course of the class, and before long I was once again fighting the urge to break down and cry.
 Luckily by the end of the class, Mr. Whethers had become so frustrated with the complete lack of attention being paid him by the gossipers, he'd actually started writing them up for detention.
 As class finally ended, James cracked one of the first smiles I'd ever seen grace his face.
 "Wow.
 I never would've thought anyone could push old Whethers so far.
 He just set a school record for the most detentions assigned in a single class."
 With James' considerable frame opening a route through the crowded hallway, it took almost no time to make it to my locker.
 Jasmin was waiting for me, and if she didn't exactly look overwhelmed with joy, she at least wasn't scowling.
 We were just outside Mrs. Campbell's class when a muted hiss from Jasmin alerted me to impending danger.

 In what was for me a rare display of common sense over curiosity, I shelved the rest of my questions and looked for something I could use to help him sidestep the memories.
 "Growing up surrounded by this, and neither you or Rachel play an instrument?"
 Alec shook his head.
 "I've never had the finesse to play anything.
 Rachel took violin lessons for more than a year.
 I think she wanted to be able to play with mother.
 That was when she begged me to wire the house for sound.
 Donovan and I spent two weeks setting up mics in Mom's studio, and then another couple of weeks running sound into every other room of the house.

We rented a local storage unit and brought the furniture and clothes there but we tossed out more than we took.
 We filled nearly fifty large black garbage bags of filth and drug paraphernalia and left them for trash pickup in the alley behind the house.
 Most things of value had been stolen or pawned.
 One of these things was the expensive camera we had given him for Christmas.
 It was at the pawnshop.
 Agenda Item Two: Retrieve valuables from the pawnshop.
 The camera was sitting at a local pawnshop as collateral on a loan that expired on the very day we got there for it.
 It was the first time I had ever stepped foot in a pawnshop; it was a shit hole covered with other people‚Äôs Christmas and birthday presents.
 It was humiliating for me to be in this place and my son could not look me in the eyes the entire time we were there.
 The walls were lined with guitars, the glass counters held cameras, jewelry and trinkets of all types.

He didn't need to finish that particular sentence though.
 They'd gone easy because today was Ashure Day, and once the dance finished up, he'd be facing off against Brandon, and it would be stupid to tire himself out when he was going to be fighting for his life.
 It was a thought pretty much guaranteed to stifle a conversation, but I managed a smile.
 "Only you would come back dripping in sweat and say you took it easy."
 Alec's smile was a bit strained at the edges, but the tenderness on his face was genuine.
 "I don't know what I'd have done without you these last few weeks."
 My heart went pitter-patter, but still mindful of the fact that throwing myself at him would just result in him freaking out and keeping me at arm's length, I managed not to go all gooey on the outside too.
 Unfortunately the effort meant I was slow responding.
 He moved on before I got anything out.

Rodregas had thought that Jorin was a good lad, well behaved and bright, and his eyes were eager for signs of hope.
 Rodregas brought him extra food and words of reassurance.
 Ravenhurr had no need for him nor his mother, and he had seen other prisoners who were not of use set free.
 Rodregas had thought that Jorin would also be set free.
 Two months went by and Rodregas had developed a strong fondness for the boy; a few of the guards made jokes that Rodregas had a new pet.
 Rodregas was used to the rough humor of soldiers and let such jokes roll off.
 The night came when the father was taken for the ceremony.
 Rodregas was on guard duty when Korin came down in his new body.
 The poor lad had stared at the man who had been his father, saying nothing, but tears ran down his cheeks.
 The apprentice Immortalist had then proceeded to rape the mother.

What should be the limits placed on international involvement in the internal affairs of countries that, at least momentarily, are unable to help themselves?
 The sanctity of the sovereign state, like the sanctity of private property in a capitalist society, is a fundamental principle of the nation state system on which the present world community is based.
 Like the protectors of private property, the guardians of the sovereign state vigorously resist each attempt to limit its scope or qualify its power ‚Äì although in both instances there are obvious and well-recognized limits and qualifications.
 The sensitivity over the issue of sovereignty ‚Äì especially among former colonies and victims of imperialist aggression ‚Äì is quite understandable in view of the fact that the emergence of modern nation states over the last two centuries occurred during a period when imperialist wars and colonial conquests were accepted as part of the normal conduct of international relations.
 It is a measure of the world‚Äôs progress in this century that this standard of conduct is no longer tolerated by the international community.
 The formulation of current policy on racial memories of past exploitation or persecution is no more appropriate or conducive to human progress, however, than the false conception of policies based on an exaggerated sense of pride or egocentric self-importance derived from the glory of forceful conquest in the past.
 In both instances, attitudes of the past must give way to fresh attitudes oriented to the future.
 Some member states are understandably wary of raising these issues, out of concern that their re-examination could become an excuse for outright political interference in the internal affairs of sovereign nations, a concern which is reinforced by the non-representative character and lack of impartiality of the Security Council.
 Other nations are reluctant to assume the greater responsibilities that a clearly enunciated doctrine might impose on them.
 All would agree, however, that neither an infinite fragmentation of nation states along ethnic, cultural, religious or linguistic lines, nor a blind indifference to persecution or unconscionable neglect of its own citizens by a state government, can be justified by either reason or lofty legal principles, or be permitted by the human heart and conscience to go unchecked.

He reached down and picked up the small piece of cloth and held it up.
 He stared for some time at the design sewn into it, and then stuck it into his outer purse.
 He had a strong urge to clean up his bunk and leave the area in the order it deserved, but that would be too big of a hint of what had happened.
 So, he was careful to leave it as it was; the longer they thought he was Ravenhurr the better.
 He then walked past the rest of the wooden cots of the barracks to the back where the captain‚Äôs room was.
 The captain‚Äôs room, unlike the outer barracks, was spotless and in perfect order.
 He searched through the captain‚Äôs pair of trunks and found some clothes that fit him, though tightly.
 The captain had been a big man but not as large as Rodregas now was.
 Still the soft linen shirt of light brown, which he knew had been loose on the captain, was much more comfortable than the wizard robe he had been wearing.
 Unfortunately none of the pants would fit.

"Until last year, my sister and I would go to my parents' house on Christmas Eve for dinner.
 Then we'd open gifts and then have hot chocolate and cinnamon rolls and watch home movies.
 Teri and I would always spend the night there, and we'd all go to my grandparents' house on Christmas morning and have lunch with all the aunts and uncles and cousins."
 "What happened last year?"
 "My parents sold their house and moved to Florida.
 They came here, and Teri did too, but it wasn't the same.

 She met his gaze.
 "And what if you hadn't even been able to be with them at all?"

We were very close in size and we were often mistaken as twins although I had blond hair and he had brown.
 We fought like all brothers did, but we had always shared a bedroom and we talked each other to sleep every night.
 I never remember my mother dating much, so I think she was careful not to introduce us to any suitor until it was more serious.
 She eventually met a man who she was serious about, Dino.
 He would sometimes bring food we were not accustomed to eating, like steak.
 I had no memory of any man ever giving us a gift or anything of the sort before, but occasionally he would bring us a trinket to our mother‚Äôs delight.
 He was a big man with a dark complexion and jet-black hair and he would often talk on the phone in his native Greek.
 Thomas and I had never heard someone speak in a foreign language so it was intriguing.
 My mom soon married Dino and we officially had a stepfather.
 Shortly after they were married we moved north to Sacramento.

The leader of The Immortal Guards was called the Commander General, and Rodregas knew of his deeds and background though he had never met him.
 General Rigoria had once been the Grand Marshal of the same Knightly Order that had trained Rodregas.
 The Order was unique in that it trained not just in the various martial arts but also in the magical, and recruited those who had magical power, but lacked the temperament or intelligence to be a sorcerer.
 Instead of working toward the power of sorcery, they underwent the Sigil ceremony, gaining a magical enhancement but losing the versatility of a true mage.
 Gaining such sigils was outlawed by the guide except for their own warriors, but the Order of the Soaring Heavens was also the traditional sources for the Gods own Paladins, and even the Celestial Guild had never dared to anger the gods by interfering with their use of sigils.
 Rigoria had been one of the greatest of the Order of the Soaring Heavens, but he had grown old and his health had failed him.
 When tempted by the Immortalists with a new body, he had accepted.
 Even though such action was anathema to the very teachings of the Order, he had become an officer of the Immortal Guards, and eventually their leader.
 Several of the most powerful Knights had over the centuries, formed the officer core of The Immortal Guards.
 These Knights traded their honor for near immortality in the Guards.

His heart was torn.
 He had already warned Harruq that he would tolerate no strange behavior, yet he had given a similar warning to the man with the ever-changing face.
 ‚ÄúI do this for you, Aurelia,‚Äù he said, his decision made.
 He removed his bow and ran across the grass.
 Velixar had not moved since the brothers‚Äô departure, his hands resting on the grass, palms upward.
 His hood fell far past his eyes, blocking nearly all of his face.
 Yet even with lack of sight and sound from Dieredon‚Äôs approach, the man knew someone neared.
 ‚ÄúGreetings Scoutmaster,‚Äù Velixar said, his deep voice rumbling.
 ‚ÄúI would call you otherwise but I have not been granted your name.‚Äù

He dropped to his knees as the pressure finally ended.
 Dieredon lifted the bow and reached to his quiver.
 The blades retracted, and in the heartbeat it took him to draw two arrows, a thin string materialized in the air, ready to be drawn.
 The elf fired the arrows.
 Velixar laughed as they pierced into his stomach and chest.
 No blood ran from them.
 ‚ÄúYou must do far better than that,‚Äù he said, his fingers hooked in strange positions.
 Another blast of dark power washed over Dieredon.
 He felt his right shoulder crack into fragments.
 Darkness swam before his eyes, darkness dominated by twin red orbs.

In addition, its deployment would always be subject to veto by any of the five permanent members of the Council.
 For both these reasons, it cannot constitute a reliable mechanism for guaranteeing the security of UN member countries.
 Although a strengthening of the UN‚Äôs peace-keeping capabilities is highly desirable, it cannot serve as an adequate foundation for a cooperative security system unless the UN‚Äôs political structure is radically modified.
 Because it is essentially an addition to national forces rather than a substitute for them, funding will be a perennial difficulty and there will be strong resistance to its expansion on economic grounds.
 Furthermore, as recent events have demonstrated, nations contributing their forces will have a strong propensity to resist their active deployment in situations that involve significant risks.
 Even after the Security Council decided to send a peace-keeping force into Rwanda for strictly humanitarian purposes, none of the leading military powers, with the exception of France, were willing to contribute the modest amount of military equipment urgently needed to protect UN troops.
 Similar efforts are in various stages of maturity for establishing standing international forces at the regional level in Western Europe, Latin America and other places as part of collective security arrangements.
 The limitation of these proposals, like that of NATO and the erstwhile Warsaw Pact, is that they are fundamentally exclusive in nature and could easily become competitive with other forces as the East and West blocs have in the past.
 The strong resentment voiced by Russia at the proposal that some Eastern European nations would join NATO illustrates the danger of expanding exclusive military clubs.
 For NATO to overcome these legitimate concerns, it would have to be thrown open to all nations that seek to join and abide by its charter.

You seem not to like people prying about your attacks, and you were less happy than usual today.

 Apparently he'd decided against the truth option.
 "I¬†looked unhappy today?
 You, who never crack a smile unless you're going to get something out of it, were concerned about the fact I wasn't all smiles and giggles?
 Maybe you should flunk a test or two.
 Only it doesn't really count unless your dad, you know, the one who used to make your birthdays really special, is gone."
 Alec's mouth opened, closed, and then assumed its normal place in his unreadable mask.
 He reached out, almost consolingly, but I stepped away before he could make contact.
 I knew I should shut up before I said something really unreasonable, but my anger was in the driver's seat now.

Without peace there could be no stable basis or fertile soil for development, without development there could be no lasting and assured peace.
 The inextricable linkage between war and famine, economic dislocation and unemployment, violence and social in stability, fleeing refugees and migrating populations, high military spending and growing indebtedness argued compellingly against any uni-dimensional approach to resolving the problems of peace and development.
 In the rapprochement between the superpowers we saw an opportunity that demanded new perspectives, new attitudes and new approaches.
 In constituting its membership, the Commission has brought together a highly diverse group of political leaders, scientists, economists, government administrators and businessmen, drawn from industrial and developing nations, with a wide range of experience in presiding over government ministries, administrative departments and agencies, international development and research institutions, prominent non-governmental agencies and private companies.
 The first official plenary meeting of ICPF was held in Trieste, Italy, in October 1989, within a few days of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
 Over taken by the staggering pace of developments arising from the end of the Cold War, the world was being altered almost beyond recognition.
 Our ambition to slow the arms race appeared suddenly insignificant in the light of unfolding events.
 While we contemplated strategy, COMECON and the Warsaw Pact were breaking up, the USSR began to dissolve, democratic institutions began to spread, and command economies started transforming themselves into free market systems.
 These monumental achievements were not purchased without cost.
 Peace was accompanied by partial economic collapse in Eastern Europe.

Alec took my hand as Donovan opened the front door for us.
 He walked with a definite limp, one that was all the more painful when contrasted against his otherwise graceful movements.
 I looked questioningly at Alec, but he shook his head, so I stayed quiet as he led me into the house.
 Rachel was waiting for us in a luxuriously-furnished sitting room.
 "Mother's been asking for you, Alec.
 I told her you'd be back soon, but she's worried."
 "I suppose this is a good opportunity to introduce Adriana."
 For the first time since I'd found out about Alec's secret, Rachel was looking uncertain.
 She was suddenly the old Rachel I knew from school instead of the confident young woman who'd helped face down three terrifying shape shifters intent on sending me back to Brandon.

 Reaching lower meant he had to draw her closer.
 "Hmmm--there's a piece at the top too."
 His free hand slid along her waist and up to her shoulder blade, the result being an embrace.

 (laughs)  That was some dog, used to sit next to me and fix me with its glassy eye, just sit there for hours, man, and I‚Äôd end up thinking we were talking.
 I can still remember some of the conversations I had with that damned dog.
 It was black and tan, mostly black‚Äîwhat was it, a mix, part Rottweiler and part hellhound.
 There was no place for the eye to rest, no blank walls, no white spaces.
 And this is like Lorelei herself, really, she is made up of so many parts, she‚Äôs a Steppenwolf, in the best sense of that word, a house of mirrors, each part of her reflects a different part of yourself once you get to know her or her you, you dig?
 Anyway, I spent a good half-hour just looking around, while she stood aside and observed me.

The secretary took in the two of us, frowned almost imperceptibly at the length of the shorts and then signed a form for the other girl.
 Determined to at least try and make friends, I started to smile as she turned towards me on her way out, but the expression died as soon as I met her flat green eyes.
 My heart immediately started to race, but she was already gone, moving with grace and confidence out of the suddenly too-small office.
 I'd expected some degree of cliquishness from such a small-town, but this was bad.
 I'd never seen her before, so there wasn't any way it could be some kind of misunderstanding.
 The secretary smoothed her blouse down over an ample stomach and smiled at me.
 I told myself I was just imagining that the smile never reached her eyes.
 She seemed to know who I was, and after identifying herself as Mrs. Pendely, proceeded to quiz me about which classes I'd been in at my last school.
 She stumbled a bit when I told her I hadn't enrolled in classes before moving.
 I didn't offer any additional information, so she tried to defuse the awkwardness by asking about electives.

Jeremiah Stoutmire walked through the village of Cornrows, the hair on his neck erect.
 The cool spring breeze was weak compared to the ice that locked his spine.
 He held a torch in one hand and a shortsword in the other.
 At first, he had thought himself foolish waking in a full panic from a nightmare he could not remember.
 Then he saw others about, lit torches in their hands, and he knew his fear was justified.
 A young, fat-nosed farmer saw him awake and approached.
 ‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt sleep either, Jeremiah?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúAye, had the worst nightmares.‚Äù Jeremiah glanced at the sword in the farmer‚Äôs hand.
 ‚ÄúYou feel the same, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù
 The farmer nodded.

So what was the point in waiting?
 ‚ÄúI had a dream last night,‚Äù I began.
 ‚ÄúOnly it wasn't really a dream, but more of a vision.‚Äù Seth nodded.
 ‚ÄúWhat was it about?‚Äù I told him about the cliff and how Kojas had killed the dwarf.
 I hesitated but told him what Kojas said about him too, and I saw him stiffen.
 ‚ÄúI'm sorry,‚Äù I found myself saying.
 Seth shook his head.
 ‚ÄúIt's not your fault that he said those things about me.
 I'm happy you didn't try to keep it from me.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat should we do?‚Äù I asked desperately.
 ‚ÄúWell we know that the dwarf is dead and that Kojas knows we're here,‚Äù Seth said.

I strode off toward home, taking the long route despite my good humor.
 As I approached the old tree, its twisted and gnarled limbs reaching into a cloudless gray sky, I caught sight of an aged elf leaving.
 My stomach dropped; it was a Council member.
 Tassels hung around his neck depicting lines and accomplishments: sky blue for receiving the calling, deep crimson for service to the guard.
 His chest bore a personalized crest, an oak leaf on an unbroken shield of gold and acorn brown.
 I watched from the trees as a rainbow of a half dozen tassels fluttered behind him where he rushed down the path toward the village.
 When I walked through the door, I saw immediately Fannie had not expected company.
 The telltale signs of a hurried cleaning spell were everywhere.
 I slipped into one of the low chairs to enjoy a bowl of berries set out for company under the guise of politeness.
 We didn‚Äôt often have visitors, and I could count on a new spruce twig the times we‚Äôd had fresh berries.

He believed wrong.
 The elf fired only one more shot before Harruq crossed the room.
 The arrow lodged into Harruq‚Äôs side, and then Salvation tore through his bow and into flesh.
 A kick sent the remains tumbling out the window.
 The other archer pulled back and fired at point blank range.
 Harruq roared as he felt a sharp pain bite into his neck.
 His mind blanked.
 He dropped his swords.
 His hands closed about something soft.
 By the time his rage calmed, blood was on his hands and the remains of an elf lay in the dirt below the window.

When we rely on the inner resources, we achieve the maximum because we are constantly led to discover more of our own unlimited capacities.
 Why should we wait before acting until we are compelled by the irresistible force of the rising expectations of the world‚Äôs masses, by the explosion of violence in our cities, or by the complete breakdown of our economic systems because of spiralling unemployment?
 Why should we not act now to prevent these outcomes and reverse the trends that threaten to make them a reality?
 All the resources necessary are within our reach, within ourselves.
 We need the courage to think and say that it is time to abolish weapons of mass destruction and call a halt to the use of war for settlement of disputes, that it is time to insist that all people enjoy the most basic democratic freedoms, that there can and must be enough food produced to feed everyone, and that every person must be guaranteed the right to gainful employment.
 The barriers to these achievements are not material or technological.
 It takes money, materials and technology to make war, not to stop it.
 That requires a determination and insistence, an intolerance of violence, which must start with a commitment of the world‚Äôs leaders and the total empowerment of the UN to enforce peace.
 It takes material resources and technology to suppress people, not to make them free.
 That requires an acceptance of basic human rights as a non-negotiable minimum requirement for each nation to participate in the international community, which must start with a voluntary abdication by the great powers of the principle of rule by might that governs the present structure of the UN.

Granted that the necessary political and social commitment is forthcoming, there are a range of strategies which, taken in the proper measure and combination, can dramatically accelerate job growth and reduce unemployment.
 Each of these strategies has proved effective in stimulating employment, though none by itself may be sufficient to solve the problem.
 A comprehensive, total approach, rather than partial and half-way measures, is needed.
 No industrial country can claim that it systematically exploits all the potential benefits of the strategies in this list.
 This should be the highest priority of every Western government today.
 1.Promote small businesses: All the publicity given to the impact of down-sizing by major corporations has obscured the fact that the top 500 US firms employ less than five per cent of the US workforce.
 It is also the smaller firms that are responsible for job growth.
 Businesses employing fewer than 20 workers presently account for 57 per cent of new job creation in Europe.
 Based upon the successful examples of many developing countries that have stimulated growth in this sector, there is vast scope for expanding services to support new enterprises through better access to management and employee training courses, credit and R & D facilities; by testing and certification for those who want to start businesses; and by estab lishing business incubators to provide work space and shared services as well as technical, financial and marketing expertise to start-up companies.
 2.Reduce business failures: New businesses create most of the jobs, but they destroy most of them too, by going out of business.

"Because Lauri's as good at badgering as I am.
 See you tomorrow."
 Rick shook his head as Ted left his office.
 He knew his friend meant well, but he despised fix-ups.
 The last time he'd gone to Ted and Lauri's, Lauri had spent fifteen minutes scolding him for letting his date go home alone.
 She'd been a nice enough girl, but she'd had her own car at dinner, and it would have been totally ridiculous for him to offer to drive her home.
 According to Lauri, however, Beth would have accepted the offer and returned later to get her car, just for the chance to be alone with him.
 He was glad then that he hadn't offered.
 How could he respect a woman who would do something so silly?
 Restless now, Rick began wrapping up for the day.

And just like that, she was to blame for the entire ordeal, even though she‚Äôd never known.
 She‚Äôd been still searching the empty camp.
 At least I was off the hook.
 I surprised myself by being so slow.
 Of course, her sister would have been Aunt Fannie.
 For a flash, I felt sympathy for Fannie‚Ä¶ but it passed.
 Just because life had given her sour grapes didn‚Äôt mean she had to stomp them into wine and get drunk.
 Had Fannie known all along?
 I couldn‚Äôt answer that.

 Now that she'd finally broached the subject, Britney was unstoppable.
 "It had to have been a mountain lion, there isn't anything else around here that's both aggressive and big enough to kill people, but neither of them had been gnawed on at all, which was strange enough by itself.
 Everyone refusing to talk about it would've been enough to make it X-Files weird, but when the coroner threw such a fit, it entered a class of its own."
 Britney looked around again to make sure nobody was in hearing range, and then leaned in even closer.

It was a pleasant, if illusionary, reminder of the contact, one I was hoping would last for about the next three days.
 "You must be the poor soul who's got everyone buzzing with curiosity."
 Brandon reached into the tall, glass-fronted fridge next to the cashier while he was talking, and pulled out a bottle of water and one of those aggressively-colored energy drinks.
 He slipped some money to the cashier while I was still trying to come up with a response that didn't sound stupid.
 "Um, yeah.
 We just got into town last night."
 He handed me the bottle of water.
 "Well I hope you'll like it here."
 "Wait, what's this for?"
 The grin was back, and his teeth were still perfect.

He wouldn‚Äôt be taking the back way to Junnie‚Äôs as I had come, and he wouldn‚Äôt be leaving the village without a pack; he was likely going to a Council meeting.
 Yes, he was certainly right behind me, following me into town.
 Somehow I made it to the library without tripping or looking back, though I was nearly overcome with the temptation to turn at the door to see him one more time.
 The library steps curled around the interior of the tree, shelves cut into every space above and below, tables and racks and patrons scattered about the remaining areas.
 I found a dark, empty corner on the third level and relaxed onto a seat, leaning against the inside wall of the old tree and taking in the scent of ancient paper and binding.
 After a momentary pause to blot out the latest incident of poor self-control, I decided to attempt to locate the missing pages by magic.
 I had, after all, succeeded in growing only days ago.
 I concentrated as hard as I could and, though nothing flitted out of the shelves and onto my desk, I had a strong feeling I knew where the documents were.
 It also could have been that I knew where they had fallen from the day before.
 Regardless, I made my way over and took a few volumes and scrolls back to my secluded table.

She paused for just a second.
 But then she ran her hand over his chest, nibbling on his earlobe as she whispered, "I don't think I can."
 He groaned again.
 It had taken all the strength he had to make himself stop.
 If she kept kissing him, no power on earth, no amount of love or guilt would be able to make him stop.
 "Marie," he began, his voice cracking, "do you want to make love?"
 She froze.
 Make love?
 All she knew was that she wanted more of Rick--more of his kisses and his touches.
 She felt like she couldn't get enough.

 "Somehow I rather suspect you both have the same answer, Alec just used twice as many words to get there."

 Spanish went about like I'd expected.

I know I have a lot more power, but you both have lots of power as well, yet I can‚Äôt seem to control it.‚Äù The frustration in his own voice was clear.
 ‚ÄúCould you feel anything?‚Äù Rodregas asked Imeralda.
 ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù she responded.
 ‚ÄúYour power is strong and untamed, in flavor more like Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs power than a nymph‚Äôs or AElf‚Äôs, but Doi‚Äôvan can master the spell.
 I think the problem is that for all of your life your power was weak but easy to control.
 A mage born of power learns to control it at an early age.
 You never had to learn any control; your power was so weak that you always struggled simply to have enough power to do anything with it.‚Äù ‚ÄúOk, I never learned proper control; the spells I learned as a squire were small weak things.
 But, can I learn control now?‚Äù  Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù she responded.
 ‚ÄúBut it will probably be harder and slower than if you were learning earlier in life.

 Sneaking out after hours isn‚Äôt easy, especially at Emily‚Äôs house.
 Her parents aren‚Äôt sound sleepers.
 If we weren‚Äôt really careful, they‚Äôd wake up and then we‚Äôd have some answering to do.
 And I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd understand our reason.
 I followed Emily down the stairs, in our pajamas, to the door.
 We were careful not to make a sound but I listened closely to the sound of her dad snoring.
 When the snore rang clearly through the house, I breathed a sigh of relief.
 We threw on our sneakers and snuck out the door.
 The summer night air was cool but a little sticky and clammy, making our bodies feel damp.

"That's it?
 You aren't going to give any kind of real reason?
 I guess I should at least be glad you aren't going to lie to me.
 Unless you really didn't ever want to go, and were lying to me all along."
 Rachel shrank in on herself a little.
 It almost looked like she was going to cry, which should have made me feel bad, but I was too mad to care.
 I'd been miserable the whole way there, and especially the whole way back, and then she wanted to just pretend like none of it had happened.
 Rachel's lip trembled slightly as she finally managed to get a response out.

But the very motive which stimulated these achievements moderated them as well.
 For while these governments took concerted steps to meet the minimum needs of the population for food, they tended to overlook the equally great potential to utilize agriculture as an engine for economic growth and job creation.
 Once minimum food needs were met, attention was diverted to other sectors of the economy.
 Politically, the elimination of the famine threat arising from food shortages is one of the reasons for slower growth in agricultural productivity in recent years.
 This has resulted in a marked decline in investment by developing countries in government-sponsored agricultural research and rural techno-infrastructure.
 This tendency has been compounded by the false notion that in order to achieve economic growth, new jobs must be created in industry and services.
 Economic policy
 The resurgence of faith in the free market and liberalized trade has placed developing countries under increasing pressure from donors and international financial institutions to abandon special types of economic assistance to the agricultural sector in the form of subsidies for supply of critical inputs such as fertilizer and seeds and price supports for marketable crops.
 This pressure has recently been aggravated by the impact of structural adjustment programmes that usually involve drastic reduction in government subsidies.
 In Ghana, for instance, the cost of fertilizer as a percentage of total cultivation cost has risen ten-fold in recent years.

We had been giving him regular drug tests, which showed levels of positive, and that line had been starting to drop.
 It seemed to be leaving his system‚Äî it took a while to be completely clean.
 But at some point during the intervention, in between the crying and the lying, it occurred to me that this boy didn‚Äôt look like he was suffering the effects of withdrawals.
 His symptoms seemed to be suddenly better and his detox wasn‚Äôt as severe as we thought it would be or as bad as it had been the first time years before.
 And I cocked my head and listened more carefully to his lies‚Äî the lies which I suddenly realized were consistent with his past behavior when he was high.
 Stop the presses!
 I sprung up and shook my finger in the air in front of his face.
 ‚ÄúAre you high right now, Brandon?‚Äù ‚ÄúNah.‚Äù He looked at his Converse.
 ‚ÄúWhen was the last time you took Oxy?‚Äù No response.
 Brandon shuffled his feet and stretched his spine, scratched the corner of his eye, but as is consistent with his behavior, continued to lie and deny.

As luck would have it, Mrs. Alexander was gone again, and the substitute was typically clueless about what we were supposed to be doing.
 Alec of course spent the whole class unearthing other little bits of embarrassing information.
 I'd never experienced anything like it, every question I answered spawned two more, and he invariably seemed to figure out the underlying reasons I'd done a given thing, or reacted a certain way.
 I'd just finished describing my failed tryout for the school's production of¬†To Kill a Mockingbird, when he hit me with a completely unexpected question.
 "So tell me about both your best date and your worst date before you came here."
 I felt my skin instantly heat up, and looked down, unable to meet his gaze.
 He let me sit there for a couple of seconds, and then reached out and used one gentle finger to nudge my chin up.
 "What's the matter, afraid I'll be jealous?"
 I shook my head, fighting the urge to look back down.
 "No, there isn't anything to be jealous of.

They looked for a moment as if they were suffering my pain‚Ä¶ and then I realized the pain was gone, the siren was silenced.
 My breathing steadied, the fear abating, and their faces relaxed.
 Relief washed their expressions, but their postures remained stiff, alert.
 I pushed up to find the source of the danger and dizziness incapacitated me.
 They rushed to kneel beside me and I could see that was how they had been before my gasp had moved them to standing.
 My throat was too raw to speak, so Chevelle gave me a canteen.
 I would have taken anything, but I was glad it was water, not hot wine or that foul-tasting elixir.
 ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù I finally choked out, but they were tight-lipped.
 ‚ÄúHow do you feel?‚Äù Chevelle asked.
 His tone was off, a little shaky.

You are out traveling and adventuring, while most of us Immortalist just sit in our towers.
 I have always thought that our one weakness was our isolation.
 It is hard to know what is exactly happening when we are not out to see it.‚Äù  For a moment, Taiga paused, looking up at the crystal roof overhead in apparent contemplation of the possible implications of their isolated natures.
 After a moment, in which Van‚Äôdret waited patiently, Taiga continued, ‚ÄúYou are one of our best, and yet you are also in the world.
 The tournament draws the powerful and those who wish to be powerful.
 I would simply suggest that you keep your eyes open, and keep your  mind a little more focused both on your journey and at the Cathedral,‚Äù Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs tone almost dismissed his own comment as a simple chatter of no import.
 Accept Van‚Äôdret had been invited to have lunch with one of the most powerful people on the planet to drop the simply suggestion that he should keep his eyes open for something unusual at the Cathedral of the Heavens.
 The rest of the dinner quickly wrapped up, and Van‚Äôdret soon found himself caught up in thought as he journeyed down several floors to the Great Hall that served as the gathering place for the other Immortalist in residence in the city.
 His questing mind was rudely interrupted by a woman stepping to his side and asking him, ‚Äúso did you ask him?‚Äù ‚ÄúAsk him what?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret asked.
 The Immortalist Sorcerer in the form of a tall athletic human female with spectacular long red hair and blue eyes gave Van‚Äôdret a silent glare before responding.

The ugly creatures continued tugging at me like annoying two year old, which made me get really annoyed.
 ‚ÄúGet off me ugly looking toad dwarfs.
 Hey, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll call you, toad dwarfs.‚Äù I smiled at my quick thinking.
 I could be clever sometimes.
 Take that Seth.
 ‚ÄúSilly girl, we‚Äôre already called toad dwarfs.‚Äù The one on my leg croaked.
 ‚ÄúAw darn, never mind then.‚Äù So much for being clever.
 The one on my back grabbed my hair.
 He yanked it back.

I was resigned now, the fury gone, and so was the screeching, the pain.
 They had said the binding was dangerous‚Ä¶ There was a collective gasp as they realized I was back.
 I heard someone beside me and a flash of anger swept through me, lighting a flame at whoever it was.
 So maybe the fury wasn‚Äôt completely gone.
 I suddenly remembered the pages I had burnt in the briar patch so long ago.
 Burnt before I‚Äôd read them.
 My eyes flashed open.
 I sat up, ignoring my spinning head, but the book was already gone.
 I glared at Chevelle.
 It must have been dreadful, because he nodded and backed away, his mouth tight.

All the guards had been confused as to why Ravenhurr had kept him, as it was against the Guild rules to use any of the Hellborn in the ceremony.
 The Immortalist was trying to become Celestial not a member of the Infernal realms.
 It was a very stringent rule that everyone knew not to break, not that any of the guards was going to mention it to the Guild.
 ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù asked the man that Rodregas had tagged as ‚Äòthe leader.‚Äô ‚ÄúI am not sure who I am,‚Äù Rodregas responded.
 ‚ÄúAnd I think I will keep any answers that I figure out to myself for now.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou are not Gerald though are you?‚Äù asked the AElf maiden.
 ‚ÄúNot to ask a dumb question,‚Äù Rodregas asked in a curious tone ‚Äúbut who is Gerald?‚Äù  Silence followed his query but finally he got an answer.
 ‚ÄúHe is the man that you appear to be, whose body you now‚Ä¶ have,‚Äù responded the maiden.
 ‚ÄúAnd what are you five named?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 There was a pause at his question.
 He knew this was an important moment because once people say who they are they are much less likely to do violence.

Except plants.
 And a bird.
 But I had no idea if an animal killed by magic was edible.
 I thought of the thistle, its black roots, how it had turned to ash.
 The rabbit sniffed at the air in my direction and continued on its way, answering the matter for me.
 I was sitting in a hole, utterly alone, and it was beginning to get dark.
 Night bugs chittered, their high-pitched keens rising with the loss of light.
 I lit a thin flame to practice fire magic, leaning forward as I danced it back and forth above the ground.
 My control had progressed a good deal since my training had begun; it seemed almost easy to navigate a small flame.
 I smoothed it out into a line and traced arcs and then more intricate designs.

He was closer now, sitting opposite me, and I had the disconcerting feeling that I‚Äôd lost the bit of time when he‚Äôd moved there.
 He reached out and took my hand in his, his fingers gentle as he turned it palm up to place a pebble there.
 ‚ÄúCan you do anything with this?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Frustration was clear in my voice.
 I had already tried.
 ‚ÄúAnd no fire?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo nothing works?‚Äù The implication was there, but I didn‚Äôt know what it meant right away.
 And then it occurred to me.
 The horse.
 I had thought he had shown up because I‚Äôd impressed upon him to follow before I blacked out, but I had already been bound again at that point.
 Should I tell Chevelle?
 I didn‚Äôt know why I felt so protective of this secret.

It seemed as if he feared that if he moved, his inclusion in the discussion would be challenged.
 Jordaan, apparently satisfied with their attention, continued ‚ÄúOur ability to manipulate the sources of mana seems to be a relationship of our blood connection to a realm.
 Mortals, to a greater or lesser extent; have an ability to tap into the mana that has overflowed into our realm from the Celestial, Infernal and Elemental Realms.
 I, for one, believe that if our connections to these realms were cut,‚Äù Jordaan made a motion like knife cutting a loaf of bread, ‚Äúthat in a few years there would not be enough magic for us to use.‚Äù ‚ÄúLuckily, I can think of no way for such a thing to happen.
 But a mortal‚Äôs ability to use mana that has spilled into the mortal world is very limited.
 The Immortalists have overcome this limitation by incorporating certain people‚Äôs direct connection to these realms.
 ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Jordaan continued, ‚Äúif a mortal can add a Celestial‚Äôs ability to directly tap the Celestial power, he becomes far stronger.
 If the magic user can also tap into the Elemental powers, he again becomes far more powerful.
 Of course, the end goal of the Immortalists is to become a god.
 There are limitations; if an Immortalist were to incorporate a celestial ant‚Äôs connection to the Celestial, he would gain in power.

She only spoke a few minutes, yet three times she asked that we pray for the MCs and the poorest of the poor.
 I joined the receiving line.
 As those of us standing went first, it only took a few minutes, during which I received the clarity to recognize that God, the source of all power, only works through people who stand aside and let him.
 Mother Teresa has built a mighty force of little, brown, meek, powerful women, because she knows and practices the art of humility, as perfectly as anyone I've witnessed.
 Her ego vanishes.
 God fills the vacuum.
 One of her warm hands touched mine and the other pressed my forehead.
 She smiled as poignantly as though I were her son, and her greatness revealed itself instantly.
 Because I realized that although she earned a Nobel prize and is frequently called a living Saint, she considers herself no better than me.
 Talk about humility.

The final disaster with Richard followed a family vacation.
 Richard invited himself to join our annual family beach vacation and I allowed it.
 Richard was to watch the kids, including my two boys and his boy and girl from a subsequent marriage, one night.
 They were all in about the same nine to twelve age range.
 My wife and I wanted to have a dinner alone and Richard didn‚Äôt seem to mind.
 When we returned from dinner we discovered that he drove all of the children in his car while he drank Vodka straight from a bottle.
 Once back at the beach house, he was drunk and he verbally abused my children to the point of terror, I was done.
 I will never see him again.
 I believe being a ‚ÄúFather‚Äù and a ‚Äúsperm donor‚Äù are not at all one in the same.

His arms felt wrong, like he had no arms to push.
 Then, true panic set in and he tried to fight his way free.
 Something was wrong, the greater sigil was not becoming part of him, he was being made part of the sigil.
 Maybe these were not like the Celestial sigils at all but some kind of Infernal trap.
 He choked, as instead of breathing air he felt liquid enter his mouth and pour into his lungs.
 He was drowning in the beast!
 He had to get out or he would die.
 He was unable to move and unable to breath and was trying to do anything to live.
 His panic faded into anger.
 If he was to die, he would die fighting.

 He was a hit man, plain and simple!
 Their conversations were graphic.
 One night my stepfather won a big poker hand that included a man‚Äôs car, a classic Bentley!
 This man was called the ‚ÄúUndertaker,‚Äù but I am not sure what he did.
 Maybe he really was an undertaker but I doubt it.
 Another man they called ‚ÄúThe Banker,‚Äù and he really was a banker but he was crooked as a stick.
 They had something on him because he would do whatever my stepfather told him to do.
