Actually I was positive Mr. Peters would be amiable to the idea.
 At least he would be if Alec had remembered to work whatever magic he'd used on the Mayor the first time.
 Of course it was possible he'd forgotten to make the arrangements, but somehow I doubted it.
 Mom looked like she was starting to waver.
 "It does seem like a great opportunity, but there just isn't any good way to know for sure it's legitimate."
 That didn't sound like Alec at all.
 "Are you sure, Mom?
 They didn't arrange anything you could use to verify they're for real?"
 I suddenly realized why parents got such a big kick out of catching their kids doing something wrong.
 Mom looked so sheepish I almost laughed.

The dobro is holy.
 I have a teacher, a guy out here, you’ve never heard of him—he’s done some studio stuff, but mostly he just plays for himself and his students.
 He lives up in the hills, inherited money from, what was it, adding machines or some office supply.
 He’s an office supply heir.
 Anyway, he’s teaching me dobro.
 It’s a discipline, like any other.
 I love the dobro but, never, never would I claim to be master of it.
 CM:  	I’ve got a review here of Rain and Other Distractions.
 BG: (	laughs, garbled comment)
 CM:  	“Gardner seems content,” it says, “to wallow in the worst kind of self-pitying schmaltz, the kind of thing that Lennon kept McCartney away from, or Simon from Garfunkel.

We were in a clearing and I could see the sky clearly.
 Dark clouds covered the sky and a rumble shook the air again.
 A single drop of water landed on my cheek.
 “Oh no,” I breathed.
 Another drop landed on my forehead and then on my chin.
 Then they started to pick up speed and I covered my face with my hands.
 The rain streaked through my hair, soaking it to my head.
 Seth looked extremely annoyed as he stood there, his blue hair plastered to his face.
 His eyes were half covered by his hair and his eyes locked onto mine.
 He rolled his eyes and looked away.

Not just a local cast, an actual touring cast out of London.
 It's gotten excellent reviews all over the U.S." I stared at her blankly, unsure where she was going.
 Some of her enthusiasm wilted in the face of my incomprehension.
 "I just thought maybe you'd want to go.
 You know.
 You said you loved the music, that it was what made you want to read the book.
 It's playing for more than a month, so there's plenty of time to make arrangements.
 I can set everything up if you want."
 It seemed impossible that she'd be so insensitive to my situation.
 I opened my mouth to tell her off, and then realized she wasn't privy to everything happening in my head.

Emphasizing cultivation practices
 The phenomenal increases in productivity achieved over the past three decades through the development of improved and hybrid varieties of seeds have over shadowed and distracted attention from the equally great potential of raising yields through improvements in methods of cultivation.
 This is especially true since much of the slowdown in productivity growth is attributable to depletion of soil and water resources, which can be partially rectified or offset by improved practices.
 Growing environmental concerns in the West have generated pressure for reducing fertilizer consumption in developing countries, when in most instances fertilizer application levels are lower than those in Western Europe by a factor of five or ten times.
 Increased, rather than reduced, use of chemical fertilizers will be essential to the expansion of agriculture in these countries and can considerably increase crop yields.
 Total fertilizer consumption by developing countries is expected to double by 2010.
 Furthermore, replacing macro-nutrients lost during intensive cultivation does not compensate for the depletion of more than a dozen micro-nutrients that also determine the quantity and quality of crops.
 Even in such agriculturally diverse countries as the United States and India, it has been demonstrated that better management of micro-nutrients can raise productivity substantially – in some intensively cultivated areas by as much as 50 to 100 per cent or more in a wide variety of crops – without significant changes in the structure or method of cultivation.
 Greater attention is needed to conserving and applying organic sources of manure and raising nitrogen-fixing crops, as well as to the use of bio-fertilizers.
 Unlike the creation of new irrigated lands, the application of such environmentally sustainable field practices is neither very costly nor technology-intensive, and can be widely propagated through improvements in agricultural training and extension.

I stood there numb, wondering what I had done and how did my efforts to be the best father I could be turn into this?
 I’d hit him—once.
 But I intended to never hit my child.
 I had promised myself I would never, ever repeat this offense I had endured as a child.
 I just wanted to slap him out of it, to hurt him as we were hurting, because he seemed oblivious to the magnitude of our pain.
 It all happened so fast and when I realized that Brandon was bringing these drugs into our house, while we thought we were detoxing him, it was beyond me.
 I felt violated in so many ways, all at once and I snapped.
 Brandon’s nose was broken and my wife and sister-in-law attended to him to stop the bleeding and I sat in silent shock with Harry and Bryce flanking me on the couch— possible guards’ against any further explosion into violence.
 There was no threat of that, as this intervention was over.
 Way over.

She said she now felt worthwhile, beautiful and confident.
 She had learned how to manage the demons in her head.
 She was beautiful and it shocked me that she had ever considered anything else and to the point that she tried to destroy herself.
 I couldn’t help but compare her in my mind to Ashley.
 A young man was next.
 He spoke with a Jersey tough guy accent, was animated as he addressed the room, and his posture was that of some hoodlum walking the streets.
 He wore a sleeveless white tank top (a wife beater) revealing tattoos covering both his arms and wrapping all the way up around his neck.
 It seemed like an unusual choice of clothing given the ceremony and the fact that our son had requested that we bring him a suit, but we were looking across such a diverse room that it actually did fit.
 He was warm and friendly and although his appearance shocked me at first, just as our first impression of this facility had, he too won me over.
 He had high praise for many of the staff and students and high hopes for what was once a dismal future when he was a drug dealer and an addict.

It was Ruby.
 She sighed with relief.
 “Oh, Frey.” I was suddenly surrounded and the sight made my head spin.
 I closed my eyes tight in an attempt to stop it.
 “Get her a drink,” someone commanded.
 I felt the hand in mine then, as it was pulled away, replaced with a glass.
 I grimaced; I doubted I could hold a glass up, let alone myself.
 “Don’t worry, it’s only water,” someone reassured me.
 At the word, I realized I was parched, bone dry.
 I forced myself up, keeping my eyes tight as I concentrated on getting the glass to my lips.

"Couldn't we kiss and touch instead of talking about it?"
 He took her hand from his cheek, squeezing it.
 "Don't you remember what we talked about?
 About how-how passionate kissing can lead to lovemaking?"
 "But Rick, can't we kiss at all?"
 He raised her hand to nibble on one delicate fingertip, trying to resist the nearly irresistible impulses that the frustrated desire in her eyes and voice stirred in him.
 "Not like we were tonight.
 Don't you understand, Marie?
 When our kisses get that hot, it's hard for me to stop.
 I don't want to stop.

My life as a squire was a good life, one I appreciated more afterwards than when I was living it.
 Both the knights and the squires always started off the day with a prayer to the Celestial Gods.
 I have not done this in over forty years, but I am going to start again and I would like you to join me if you would.” The two looked at Rodregas, they were very different people, but they both seemed unsure what to say to his request.
 Finally, Doi’van nodded at Imeralda and said to Rodregas, “It has been too long since I have prayed as well, it would be good for the soul.
 Please lead us in prayer.” Imeralda did not say anything, but she nodded and followed the two of them outside.
 Rodregas knelt in the grass facing the sun, the sign of the All-Father in the celestial heavens.
 He reached out and wove his fingers together; he pulled his thumbs down and opened his woven hands in the ancient symbol of opening oneself to the gods.
 “Dear Celestials in the heavens, we open our hearts to you and we accept our duties as your warriors here in the world.
 Let your courage fill our hearts and your strength fill our arms.
 May we know the guidance of your twin children, Honor and Justice.” He then knelt down and pulled one of the two short swords from his weapon harness; he crossed his arms and laid the blade across his own upper arms.

I'll show you how to call me at work in case you need something."
 "What time will you be home?"
 "Well .
 .
 .
 last week I never got home before 9:00."
 Her eyes widened, and he grinned, continuing, "But today I'll be home by 5:30.
 I promise."
 She wandered around the house restlessly after he'd left.
 His house was big, and he had a lot of interesting things, but she didn't like being alone.

"Mother is playing again.
 She just finished up with 'Courtship', so the next one will be 'Welcoming'."
 It was amazing how quickly I could forget his supernatural abilities.
 Most of the time he seemed so normal.
 If you could consider any gorgeous, well-built boy who happened to be interested in me normal.
 Every so often though he'd do something that should be impossible.
 Alec's smile was slightly apologetic.
 "Sorry about that.
 Would you like to listen as well?"
 My confusion earned me a chuckle.

He lifted open a single eye and glared at the blurry image of his brother.
 “The sun is almost up,” Qurrah said, kicking him again.
 “You need to be as well.”
 “What are you…‌awww, damn it.”
 He sat up straight and shook his head, trying to clear the fuzz that clogged the vast empty space between his ears.
 Qurrah helped by offering a third kick, this one right to the kidney.
 Harruq gasped and staggered to his feet.
 He was outside their little home in seconds, urinating on the grass.
 “Hadn’t pissed yet,” Harruq shouted to his brother.
 “You could be a bit kinder, you know.”

I mentally shrugged as I swapped out books, and set off.
 Rachel was already seated in her usual spot in no-man's-land.
 I debated where to sit for a second.
 I'd done the right thing in standing up to Cassie, but I didn't want to further alienate Brandon, or put myself anymore firmly in the group of idiots who looked to Alec as their master and liege.
 Before I could finish weighing the pros and cons, Rachel looked up and caught my eye.
 The smile that appeared on her face was tentative but genuine, and completely resolved my doubts.
 I returned her shy greeting with a smile of my own, and sat down at the table closest to her.
 Britney entered the tutor lab a few minutes later, and frowned at me before going over and sitting at the end of the room containing the jocks and cheerleaders.
 Apparently I was supposed to have waited?
 I sighed and flipped open my book.

It was such an easy promise, but could he keep it?
 What if Velixar ordered otherwise, or someone close to Aurelia struck against Qurrah?
 He sighed.
 In his heart, he knew he could never again strike at Aurelia, regardless of what anyone else wanted of him.
 The look on her face when he had stabbed her, that combination of sadness and shock, would haunt him forever.
 “Fine,” he said.
 “I promise.
 Happy?”
 “Far from it.”
 Aurelia crossed her legs, tossed back her hair, and then leaned her head on her hands as she stared into the fire.

How long before we get to the punch-line?
 Jim – Not to long now, he couldn’t hold out long under the pressure.
 Even pretending to be strait-laced was hard on Gene, he actually had to cut his hair and look ‘respectable’
 Art – Was I really that out of it during the divorce?
 Gene cut his hair and actually wore nice clothing.
 I think I would have noticed that Jimbo, are you trying to pull one on me?
 Jim  - This all actually happened, and you were out of it, you forgot to pay the bills for three months, and if you recall you wouldn’t take the time to eat unless either Gene, Liz or I brought you something and nagged till you finished it.
 Art – Ah yes, food the fuel for life.
 It doesn’t seem all that important to eat when your world is falling apart.
 How long did it take for Gene to finally snap?

Dieredon twirled his bow, his face calm and emotionless.
 “Too many have died at your hand.
 What life you have ends tonight.”
 Velixar roared, a sound that made Qurrah shiver and avert his eyes.
 His master’s back was to him, so he could not see the face that Dieredon saw, which was full of rotted skin and crawling, feasting things.
 Suddenly Dieredon pulled back.
 The blades in his bow snapped inward.
 “Arrows cannot hurt me,” Velixar mocked.
 “They did not the first time.
 Why do you hope so now?”

The stinger narrowly missed Seth, and I saw him stumble back in surprise.
 He swung his sword at the stinger.
 It sliced through and the creature screeched so loud I was afraid everyone would hear it.
 The stinger fell on the ground and dark blood oozed from the cut.
 “Now Jazell!” Seth yelled to me.
 I notched an arrow and took aim at the thrashing belly.
 I pulled the string back and released it.
 The arrow whizzed through the air and sunk into the creature’s belly.
 It shook and fell to the ground.
 Seth ran from underneath it right before it crushed him.

The staff blocked one but the other banged against her calf.
 “One to two,” Harruq said.
 He double thrust, offering the elf no reprieve.
 She jabbed her staff upward, pushing the two attacks high and giving her room underneath.
 Ducking forward, she tried to strike the half-orc’s leg.
 She badly underestimated Harruq’s new speed though, and one blade looped around to block the attack.
 The other went straight down, the edge smashing hard against the top of Aurelia’s skull.
 While it did not draw blood, the jolt of it knocked the elf to one knee and gave her a dull ache in her head.
 “Have you lost your mind?” Aurelia asked as she rolled away.
 Harruq’s mad charge was her answer, and it sparked fear in her heart.

Many cases of ethnic conflict have an under lying basis of economic deprivation that must be addressed before tensions will permanently subside.
 Others can be mitigated by the introduction of positive economic incentives for cooperation.
 Economic cooperation is already dissipating ethnic tensions and conflict in the Middle East.
 It can be creatively fostered in the Balkans and elsewhere.
 In other cases, the modification of the electoral and constitutional systems in a culturally appropriate manner can reduce or eliminate tensions in ethnically divided countries.
 International assistance is also needed for coping with tensions arising from the sharing of natural resources – particularly water resources – and chemical or radioactive pollution of air, soil and waterways.
 Resolution of these issues requires the mediation of international experts for impartial assessment and formulation of equitable recommendations.
 Regional security organizations can play a leading role in this capacity.
 An effective international judicial system is vitally important to the expanded role contemplated for the UN in dealing with arms and drugs trafficking, terrorism and crimes against humanity.
 This requires, as a minimum step, either that the International Court of Justice be granted mandatory jurisdiction over such cases by member states, or that an International Criminal Court be established with jurisdiction over these offences and other crimes under international law, thus strengthening both the preventive and enforcement capabilities of the international community against non-traditional threats to security.

Rick's tongue darted inside.
 And the flame that it created shot through her entire body, surprising her with its power and heat.
 Her body ached with a pleasure that seemed too intense to bear.
 Intoxicated, she wrapped her arms around Rick’s neck, moaning.
 Powerfully aroused by that moan, Rick slid one hand down her back to press her closer.
 She shuddered with pleasure as he began kissing her neck.
 He undid the first button on her dress.
 "I want you, Marie," he rasped, raising his head to look into her eyes.
 Marie gazed into his eyes for a moment.
 "I can't!"

She banged on the door.
 The door opened, and her father stared at her in shock.
 Her mother, however, jumped out of bed with a cry of joy and threw her arms around Marie.
 "Marie!
 You're all right!
 I can't believe you're all right!"
 Mr. Tranton at last recovered and wrapped his arms around both women, laying his cheek against his daughter's hair.
 He'd thought he'd been in control of his world until Marie had disappeared.
 He would have given that world to have her back.
 Marie pulled back a bit when she heard her father sniff.

 BG:  	First, as we’ve discussed, I don’t see that big a change between Memphis and L.A.
 I mean, geographically, yes, Big City vs. hometown, sure.
 But, as for my art, there’s a direct line from Turntable Poison to Rain and Other Distractions.
 There’s a road if you wanna delineate it.
 CM: 	Really?
 That’s what I want to hear about.
 Not just the line between the works but what was going on in your life.
 I mean, stylistically, you did go from blues/psychedelic rock, in the British invasion vein, to soft rock…

A hand touched his shoulder.
 He recoiled as if struck.
 “Well done,” Qurrah said, his eyes locked on the corpse.
 Harruq recognized that look.
 His brother had seen something he wanted, and he would have it.
 “A strong life and a fresh death.”
 “The battle?” Harruq asked.
 Even as they stood there, he watched several orcs go running past, howling murder.
 “We will partake in our own way,” Qurrah said, kneeling beside the orc.
 The savage clutched his stomach, his hands the only thing holding in his innards.

We'll have you safely back home sometime early tomorrow morning, and your mom will never have the slightest idea you went to such a wild gathering."
 As far as reassurance went, it was a pretty lame attempt, but somehow it didn't sound so feeble when it was Brandon saying it.
 I calmed down enough to marvel at the amount of other baggage Vincent dragged out of the house, and then any chance I might have had to back out vanished as Brandon picked me up and deposited me on the tailgate of Vincent's truck.
 "Riding in the back, isn't that illegal?"
 The high-maintenance blonde Vincent was helping up next to me rolled her eyes.
 "Please."
 Brandon helped a couple of late arrivals into the pickup, and then closed the tailgate.
 I half thought he was going to ride up front in the crowded cab, but he instead cleared the sides of the truck in a jump that was almost inhumanly graceful.
 He crowded in, close enough I could feel my skin start to tingle with anticipation, and then Vincent started the engine and we were off.
 In what was probably the only display of maturity and common sense I'd ever seen out of Vincent, he didn't tear off down the freeway at eighty miles per hour.

 If you can’t get an arrow in before I can cut off the stinger, then I’ll have to do it myself.” “Fine boss dude,” I said with a snort.
 Seth ducked and charged the creature, his sword held out behind him.
 Jason flicked some knives into his wrist and flung them at the creature.
 Some hit their mark, which was signaled by the creature roaring out in pain, others fell into the dirt.
 Emily danced close to it, spinning fire from her fingertips.

The world produces more than sufficient food to amply provide for all of humanity.
 Still, more than 800 million people spread throughout the developing world lack sufficient and secure access to nutritious food and clean drinking water.
 Between 1990 and 2000, malnutrition declined from 21 per cent to 18 per cent of the population of developing countries, but it actually increased marginally among the least developed nations, particularly in Africa.
 Incidence of malnutrition among children under five years of age remains severe in both Africa and South Asia.
 But the problem is more complex than these numbers suggest.
 Although India is considered a food surplus state, it is home to the largest number of undernourished people in the world and access to a balanced diet and clean drinking water is far below the basic requirements for sound health.
 Projections indicate that over the next decade growth of the world’s food supply will be adequate to meet the needs of all human beings.
 The UN Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of human beings suffering from hunger and malnutrition between 1990 and 2015 is highly commendable, yet achieving it would still leave an unconscionably large number of people without adequate food.
 More can and must be done in the next decade to eradicate the scourge of hunger.
 The problem of water scarcity is even more pervasive and challenging.

Regardless of how he’d treated me, Chevelle was still a member of Council.
 He spun on me, but I could not place the expression on his face.
 Panicked, I tried to recover.
 “You’re my watcher.” It still sounded angry, so I added, “Why?” He hesitated.
 “Frey…” His voice was gentle and he seemed to be searching for a way to answer.
 He must have decided I had no right to anger, because his face turned hard, his tone formal.
 “The council was concerned after you tried to choke Evelyn of Rothegarr.” I drew a sharp breath.
 “What are you talking about?” It caught me off guard; I was more than offended.
 Does he really think I choked Evelyn?
 I bit down against my words, remembering the trouble I was already in with Council.

However, the overall impact of manufactured exports from developing countries has been vastly exaggerated.
 Exports by the Newly Industrializing Economies to the United States have risen from 1.1 to 2.1 per cent of US GNP over the past decade.
 America’s share of trade with low-wage countries represents only 3 per cent of GDP, compared to 2 per cent in 1960.
 For the OECD as a whole, imports from low-wage countries represent only 1.5 per cent of total expenditure on goods and services.
 On the other hand, there is irrefutable evidence that expanding international trade creates large numbers of jobs, even in high-wage economies.
 The real issue, therefore, is whether the overall balance favours net job creation or net job destruction for each nation and for the global economy.
 On this issue the evidence is clear.
 Protectionism reduces overall economic welfare, often hurting those with the lowest incomes.
 In the long term greater international trade, like technology, expands overall employment opportunities substantially.
 Trade also counters the tendency of prices to increase along with incomes in more developed countries.

I have watched the world evolve, and I have watched gods make war.
 Do not accuse me of having a lying tongue.
 The truth is always enough, even for those who walk in the darkness.”
 “Forgive me, master,” Qurrah said, bowing.
 His teeth chattered in the cold.
 Velixar waved a hand.
 The dwindling fire between them swelled to a healthy blaze.
 “The two brothers were arrogant to think they could create a paradise with a creature so full of faults as man,” Velixar continued.
 “I saw the battle waged in the small town of Haven, there in the center of the delta.
 It is an awesome thing to watch gods duel.

As I continued my survey, I realized that there was only ever one pile of books at any given table, and in the few instances in which two people were sitting at a table, one of the individuals was obviously explaining something to the other one.
 Most of the kids looked fairly run-of-the-mill.
 There was even the expected contingent of jocks, obviously there just because a coach or parent had delivered some kind of ultimatum.
 Britney predictably headed over and staked out a table as close as she could get to a group of girls who were probably cheerleaders.
 Clustered around the other end of the room were the more studious kids, the kind who were generally pretty smart, but for whatever reason were struggling with math.
 I wasn't surprised to see a kind of a no-man's-land between the two ends of the spectrum.
 I was startled to see that the middle ground was inhabited by an attractive girl a year or two younger than me.
 Left to my own devices, I would've normally picked a table over on the nerd end of the room, but I found myself relating more to the girl stuck in the middle.
 She looked up and met my gaze for just a second before ducking back down and concentrating on her homework.
 Shy, obviously, and not popular.

I’ve never seen so many in one place before.
 A Thrasher pack had at least six or seven but there must have been more than ten monsters total.
 It was scary.
 Right then, right at that very moment, I knew something was terribly wrong.
 They all stopped in front of us, all those pairs of angry eyes staring at us.
 They made me confused, from the warm feeling the Frost Beasts gave me to the cold feeling the Thrashers inflicted.
 They exchanged some sort of signal, including grunts and yips, and slowly advanced on us.
 The dogs stalked toward the four of us looking like a animals about to attack their prey.
 The cute look was gone and all that was left was hunger.
 The dog nearest to me jumped at my chest and landed on my stomach.

He looked back and she looked confused, squinting as if the room was not fully illuminated by the glowing daemons in their pits.
 “Can you not see into the room?” Rodregas asked.
 “No, I can see something, shapes flicking in fire?
 I think I smell something like rotten eggs, but I can’t see well enough to go in.
 And I don’t know why, but I really don’t want to go in.” Doi’van and Rodregas shared another look and then nodding, stepped out of the chamber.
 The three of them stood silent for a minute.
 Finally, Doi’van spoke, “Maybe you need a connection to see the doors and the room?
 All of us worship the Celestials and we were all drawn to their sigils, especially Rodregas.
 I was drawn to the door here, which makes sense.
 This room, like the Celestial Chamber, seems to have similar beasts of the Infernal realm.

Judging by the orchestra, it was almost time.
 I looked back, intending to shoot the obnoxious pair a nasty glare in the hopes it would shut them up, and instead caught Alec's eye.
 The house lights were still bright enough for me to make out every detail of his perfect face, and yet I was still baffled by his expression.
 He'd obviously been staring at me, was still staring at me actually, but it wasn't a leer.
 It was something else, it made me want to blush, or maybe smile and toss my hair.
 Whatever it was, it left my skin feeling warmer than usual, and more than a little tight.
 Even after I looked away with a flush of embarrassment, I still felt like I could feel his eyes watching me.
 I could feel his presence behind and to the left of me, like a gentle tingle of electricity I could've pointed to even with my eyes closed.
 I resisted the urge to look back again as the lights dimmed and the orchestra began the opening strains of the first number.
 The actor playing Jean Valjean strode out onto the stage, and even weighed down by chains, he still commanded everyone's attention as though he was a member of the nobility.

So, Christ, what was my point?
 We were playing these gigs, getting bigger, getting a rep.
 This was the end of the sixties.
 There was talk of a concert in upstate New York that was gonna blow everybody away.
 And we had just signed on with Pete Holder, who was both lawyer and agent.
 Well, Pete said, he thought he could get us in on this New York concert.
 He was talking to Bill Graham, who was bringing in some new acts, one of which, I remember was Cocker, who nobody knew.
 And Graham was kind of holding the proceedings hostage, making demands, etc.
 And Lennon was going to play, they said, but Hoover, that bastard,  was keeping him out of the states, and, anyway there was all this legal maneuvering going on, and, somehow, it just never happened.
 You know, if Black Lung had played Woodstock it would have been a different history, right?

In 1993 alone, consumer prices rose by more than 100 per cent in 15 countries, out of which 11 former republics of the USSR reported increases of more than 300 per cent.
 This was accompanied by a sharp rise in unemployment from extremely low historical levels prior to 1989 up to an average of 17 per cent in 1994.
 The tremendous physical and psychological stress experienced by people in the region as a result of the economic collapse is reflected in the sharp fall in birth rates and the steep rise in death rates.
 Since 1989, the birth rate has fallen by more than 20 per cent in Poland, 25 per cent in Bulgaria, 30 per cent in Estonia and Romania, 35 per cent in Russia and more than 60 per cent in Eastern Germany.
 Such abrupt changes have been observed previously in industrial societies only during times of war.
 Infant mortality is rising in many of the countries.
 Not surprisingly, there have been increasing indications of public discontent and voter dissatisfaction with the course of the reforms in the vast majority of countries.
 Simultaneous Shocks
 The collapse of the East European and Central Asian economies from 1990 to 1994 resulted from their exposure to a series of simultaneous shocks.
 1.Stabilization and adjustments: The majority of countries, having suffered from inflation and balance of payments problems in the 1980s, applied sharp stabilization and adjustment programmes in the early 1990s to stop inflation, balance budgets, and close balance of payments gaps, while at the same time liberalizing prices in order to correct major price distortions.

When he pulled it up he saw that it was a helmet, a solid Mithril skullcap with sides of chain mail designed to be connected at the bottom.
 He reached up and pulled it on his head, but even his head was too large for the AElfin style Mithril armor.
 It quickly joined the suit of armor and the candleholder on the bed.
 On the bottom shelf he found a nice pair of boots, not of AElven make.
 Attached were matching grieves, armor designed to protect the lower leg., and a pair of armored gauntlets to compete the set.
 All ended up on the bed.
 Nothing else of interest was in the wardrobe.
 Though the two fanciest robes both heavily embroidered and of Western Silk, also went to the bed.
 Next, he went to the trunk which was made of High Cedar wood and which matched the large wardrobe, but was much more portable.
 Unfortunately, the only items of use in it were several blankets of good quality wool.

“Thank goodness we found you.” I looked at her pale face and frowned.
 “Are you okay?” She nodded vigorously.
 “Yes, it’s just hard work to use my magic.
 I need a lot of concentration.” We all ducked behind a half-dead tree to escape from the swarms of monsters.
 We were breathing heavily.
 I leaned my head against the tree’s cold bark, wanting to disappear from it all.
 “Where’s Seth?” Emily asked.
 I raised my head.
 “We haven’t found him yet.” Her eyes widened.
 “What do you mean, you haven’t found him yet?” “I crashed into Jazell, who was doing, like, forty,” Jason pointed to me.

Your automobile?"
 "Sure.
 Would you like that?"
 "I'd love it!"
 She almost choked on her Slurpee, the first she'd ever had.
 "Where can I drive to?"
 "From one end of the parking lot to the other."
 "A parking lot?"
 "I'll take you to a big, empty parking lot somewhere and let you get the feel of it.
 When you feel comfortable, I might let you drive around some quiet neighborhoods, but you need to study the rules of the road so you can get a license.

With a sigh he took plates from the cabinet.
 Marie put two wontons on her plate.
 "Did I ever tell you about my wedding gown?"
 "Your mother’s?"
 "Yes.
 It's beautiful.
 It's covered with lace and pearls, and it has a 15-foot train.
 But the important thing is that it was my grandmother's.
 She wore it, and then my mother wore it.
 I've always known that I'd wear it when I get married."

“I shall do as you command,” Ahrqur said in a lifeless voice.
 “Of course,” Velixar said.
 “There is no other way.”
 Ahrqur glanced to Qurrah, and his mouth opened to speak.
 Both Tun brothers felt a bit of panic, wondering what their new master might say if he learned what they had done.
 Instead, he closed his mouth and glared at Velixar one last time before running north on legs that would never tire.
 “When will you know of his success or failure?” Qurrah asked once his eyes could no longer perceive the elf’s faint outline.
 “Immediately,” Velixar whispered.
 “All he sees, I see.
 All he hears, I hear.

I had never felt this before and I have never felt it since.
 Bill jokingly picked up a coin from the change on the bar and said “I’ll flip you for her” to which I replied, “Flip all you want, that is going to be my wife!” Bill flipped the coin anyway and I called “tails,” and tails it was.
 I had no choice but to muster the courage to talk to her.
 Her reception was cool.
 Her name was Lisa and she was there to meet her friend who happened to be dating the bartender (who I knew well) so that was a good angle for me to work.
 I was doing pretty well getting to know her when a couple of girls I knew (and who I had hit on earlier) decided to have a little fun and disrupt my progress with this stunning lady.
 The two girls leaned in, their long dark hair flowing down and draping over each of my shoulders.
 They began whispering some very descriptive suggestions in my ears as they stroked their fingers through my hair.
 I can dual task with the best of them, but the offer I was getting in my ears conflicted with the vision across the table.
 I didn’t take my eyes off of Lisa but that wasn’t enough to keep the target of my affections seated while I was being propositioned by two beautiful brunettes.

 BG: 	Well, so much of this shit they do now, man, you don’t even have to be in the same city.
 You gotta realize multi-tracking was relatively new, and, man we were babes in the wood, naives, we didn’t know how to play without someone playing with us.
 We started out on 4 tracks, remember that.

Again came the polite knock; no one would dare such persistence without direct orders from Ravenhurr.
 It had to be Adapt Korin.
 He nearly leaped off the bed and looked for a sword but of course there was none.
 He stepped in front of the bedroom door as he quickly did his best to close the broken study door.
 He quietly unlocked it and stepped back and said simply, “Enter,” and waited for the Adapt to come inside.
 Korin came into the room with a relaxed step that showed him to be much more comfortable than Rodregas was.
 Korin was a good looking man.
 It was always weird with him.
 He changed bodies so often that you always felt like you were meeting someone new, but it was not long before you realized that it was Korin.
 He wore a slim male body that was well-built, not much over 20 years old, with blue eyes and blond hair.

The crowd of students had drifted to the sides of the hall, like worshipers making way for a pair of pagan gods.
 Even so, there still wasn't quite room for them to walk side by side.
 The girl was leading.
 Her dark, wavy hair and flawless skin would've made her pretty in any crowd, but she also had perfectly symmetrical features and one of those bodies that required hours each day in the gym to maintain.
 I wanted to hate her.
 It didn't make any sense, she could hardly be blamed for taking care of herself, but it just didn't seem fair.
 Simply by being in the same town as us, she automatically made every other girl in school feel like bloated, heifers.
 Surely she was somehow cheating to be doing so well in the subtle, nasty game in which every high-school girl ranked herself against every other female.
 I probably would've spent the rest of the day depressed, but once she was out of my line of sight I was able to see the boy following her.
 He was incredible.

He tried to find the right thing to say.
 Rodregas looked down at her with her head on his shoulder and her pile of auburn curls spread equally over both their naked bodies.
 Her long hair covered a lot of the two of them but really hid nothing.
 He met her large green eyes and said, “You amaze me.
 I knew you were brave and courageous, but now I know where your true magic talent is...” He looked at her eyes as he spoke and even when he smiled at his own words, he let her see the sincerity of what he said.
 The main rule of flattery with women is to never lie.
 It was a lesson taught to Rodregas by a lost love, and one that had served him well over the years.
 Most women can always tell a lie, especially in such a moment of connection as the talk after good sex.
 Luckily, even with far more normal women there is always something good you can say; with Imeralda he could have gone on for hours.
 Imeralda’s eyes lit up in pleasure and humor at his words but, of course, he was careful to say nothing of the future, nothing of love.

Billy and I discussed and concluded Eric would explain to the teachers about how Kenny’s folks’ divorce was making him crazy.
 Eric would promise to pay for the window, and get himself and Kenny pardoned.
 But somebody had called the police.
 Though Kenny ran like the cartoon mouse Speedy Gonzales, he wasn’t as good at hiding.
 The police found him crouched behind a bus bench on his way circling back to the lot where he had parked his mom’s Volkswagen.
 They consulted the witnesses and booked Kenny for vandalism.
 The teachers to whom Eric surrendered turned him over to the police, who drove him home to Sylvia and sent a report about him to the school board.
 A few days later, Eric and Kenny got expelled for having been intoxicated on school grounds.
 Mrs. Hazel Bole, our vice principal, summoned Billy and me.
 She was a big woman, in size and spirit, a person of understanding and compassion, who tried hard to prepare us seniors for the real world.

 Memphis still counts you as one of its own, yet you don’t talk about it much.

Brandon already had plenty of reasons not to be with me, it was the height of stupidity to give him any more.
 I could probably deal with not having a boyfriend, even assuming that was what we were right now.
 Going half a year without anyone to talk to because my mom was wrapped up with her art and everyone else in the town thought I was stuck-up would be more than I could take.
 The thought was enough to leave me speechless for the entire drive home.
 Brandon seemed content to leave me alone with my thoughts as he sped around the various turns at speeds that normally would've made me protest.
 As I went to leave the car, he grabbed me by my back pocket, which nearly made me shriek in surprise.
 "Hey, you know what you need to put all this in perspective?"
 "No, but then I think it's more than just a matter of my perspective being off."
 My fear of alienating him had almost vanished in the rush of indignation over how he'd grabbed me.
 I wanted to say something even more snarky, but there was just enough worry left to curb my tongue.

Eugene – What?
 Jim – Remember that you promised Art that you would stay out of trouble.
 Eugene – I would ask her first.
 Jim – What if she said no, would you still try to touch her breast.
 Eugene – Well yeah, I’m not about to do all that work to find her just to go home empty handed.
 Johnny – (Yells)ARGGHHHH!
 Eugene & Jim – What’s wrong?
 Johnny – That pun was awful.
 Eugene – It wasn’t that bad.
 Johnny – It was terrible.

My bemused state was interrupted by Rachel leaning forward and tapping me on the shoulder as she gestured for James to turn his music down.
 "I almost forgot.
 Guess what, Les Misérables is coming to Las Vegas.
 Not just a local cast, an actual touring cast out of London.
 It's gotten excellent reviews all over the U.S." I stared at her blankly, unsure where she was going.
 Some of her enthusiasm wilted in the face of my incomprehension.
 "I just thought maybe you'd want to go.
 You know.
 You said you loved the music, that it was what made you want to read the book.
 It's playing for more than a month, so there's plenty of time to make arrangements.

His thoughts, dreams, and nightmares are available to me, hidden behind locked doors to which I now hold the key.”
 Again, Qurrah lusted for such power and control.
 Velixar smiled, clearly seeing the desire the half-orc hid behind his eyes.
 “One day you will hold such control.
 For now, be content with what I have taught you.”
 Qurrah gave a soft laugh and then nodded.
 “I believe that shall suffice.”
 Harruq did not know why, but the short exchange sent chills running to the pit of his stomach.

At least that’s how I think he works.
 Johnny – What does that have to do with anything?
 Jim – If everyone knew about him it would change how the acted towards him.
 They would treat him like he was special and give him more lee-way.
 Johnny – So, where’s the downside to that?
 Jim – It’s just not Gene’s way.
 He likes to create a nuisance and a spectacle.
 He’s better at the former than at the latter, but he does try.
 If people found out that his father beat him, well they would explain away his actions with some text-book psychology and do more to try and ignore him.
 That would really piss Gene off.

Eugene – Life.
 For myself, I prefer life.
 For others, I prefer choice.
 Johnny – What does that mean?
 Eugene – I choose to live, but I leave it to other people to make their own choices.
 I don’t want to make their decisions for them.
 Jim – What does that have to do with anything?
 We’re talking about personal preference and you’re trying to move it up into the realm of philosophy.
 Eugene – I just thought it sounded good.
 Jim – Right.

Salvation and Condemnation quivered in his hands.
 “There’s no room for compassion.
 Not here.
 Not tonight.”
 He left the house, blood covering his blades.
 He let out a primal cry to the stars, whether of anguish or elation, he did not know.

 She'd probably like chocolate.
 There wasn't time to make anything, so chocolate ice cream would have to do.
 He still couldn't believe that this had happened.
 He didn't believe in extraterrestrials, he didn't believe in ghosts, and he certainly didn't believe that people could travel through time.
 But here she was.
 His mind reeled with the implications and unreality of it all.
 And the emotion that permeated his jumbled thoughts was guilt.
 He'd been preoccupied with thoughts of Marie ever since he'd seen her picture.

Its global education programme proposal placing appropriate emphasis on the key issue of girls' and women's education is one that particularly commends itself to UNESCO, which is already actively engaged in efforts along similar lines in conjunction with its UN partners.
 This timely report should help to promote the idea of human-centred development within a culture of peace as a way forward to a better world.
 We are gratified that ICPF should have assigned UNESCO, as the intellectual arm of the United Nations, a prominent role in its recommended agenda for action, and we reaffirm our commit ment to working with all possible partners in pursuit of the goal of global peace and sustainable human development.
 Federico Mayor Director General UNESCO
 The International Commission on Peace and Food began its work at a time of uncommon opportunities for rapid transition on a global scale to democratic ways of life, freedom of the media, and an independent judiciary; food, literacy, health and jobs for all; and sustainable life styles based on harmony between humankind and nature.
 The end of the Cold War and the consequent shift of expenditure from defence to development, the onset of the Information Age and the organization of information superhighways, the growth of mechanisms for regional cooperation, a renewed faith in the United Nations, and commitment to multilateral negotiations and action all provided new opportunities for achieving global peace and prosperity.
 Rapid progress in the application of science and technology in agriculture, industry, and human health strengthened the hope that the concept of 'food, education, health and employment for all' can be converted from rhetoric into reality, provided the peace dividend can be deployed to achieve these goals.
 ICPF had the advantage of building on the work of earlier independent commissions, particularly those chaired by Willy Brandt, Gro Harlem Brundtland and Julius Nyerere.
 We began our work with the conviction that, as Willy Brandt said, 'the problems created by men can be solved by men'.
 The ancient Indian scripture, Bhagavad Gita, expressed the same sentiment by stressing, 'Whatever man aspires to, that he can accomplish.'

Maybe it wouldn’t work, but I could try.
 I wasn’t sure I felt anything, but after a few minutes I imagined my right hand might have tingled a little.
 I grabbed a close volume and leafed through it.
 It was a legacy of the Viridian Forest clan.
 I pulled another volume down.
 A diary of Momar the Ancient.
 I sighed.
 This was going to be like trapping a greased pixie.
 I sat for hours exploring the early texts, stories of the river clans and their battles with the Imps of Long Forgotten, firsthand accounts of the Trials of Istanna, and the long lineages of the eldest families.
 A whisper roused me from my studies and I realized it was late, so I decided to give up and start again the next day.

 I would never run off and leave you wondering what had happened to me."
 She hugged her mother.
 "I love you, Mother.
 And I need--" "Marie?
 Davis is leaving."
 John had come in search of them.
 "Are you all right?"
 "We're just having a mother/daughter talk," Mrs. Tranton said as Marie reached for a napkin.
 "Tell Davis she'll be out in a minute."

"But you've never loved him like you did Andrew."
 "There are different types of love."
 "But you understand when I say that I don't want anyone else, that I could never love any other man the way I love Rick and that I don't want to settle for anything less."
 "Yes, I understand.
 But--" "No.
 If I can't have Rick, I don't want anyone."
 She cried against her mother's shoulder until her tears were exhausted.
 Was Rick as miserable as she was, she wondered.
 Was he sorry he'd made it possible for her to go home?
 Was he wishing they'd made love?

I don’t remember.
 And Elvis came backstage—I think he was mostly staying in Hollywood, then, making all those execrable movies--and I was like right there next to him and he had just done this kickass set and the crowd was eating him like pep-pills.
 And he sat down next to me and turned over and said, you’re in Black Lung, right?
 I mean, this guy was fucking huge but he knew his home stuff.
 He knew what was going on.
 I was impressed—hell, I was blown away.
 So, yeah, I’ve got my Elvis story.
 I’m from Memphis, I met Elvis.
 It’s not much of a story, really is it?
 I mean, I know people who know Elvis, right?

I couldn’t look away but stammered to Ruby, “What’s happening?” “They are trying to overpower one another.” I could hear the pleasure in her voice.
 “No silly games, just power.” The way she said it had some part of my mind wondering whether her statement about not having her mother’s ambition was true.
 But I could only concentrate on the struggle in front of me.
 No visible action.
 I tried to judge by appearance who might be winning.
 Chevelle’s jaw was set, eyes dark.
 Steed flinched, but I had no idea if it was pain or magic.
 The only thing I was sure of was that neither intended to lose.
 Their stances, right down to their gazes, were absolutely unwavering.
 A sound behind me drew attention to how quiet the valley had grown as we watched this unanimated brawl.

“How else?” I asked innocently.
 He nodded.
 “Some of the others, well, they seem to think you encouraged the snake to go under its own power.
 Silly, I know.” He was watching my response.
 I tried sidetracking him.
 “Ruby says no one can control animals.” “You’ve been talking to Ruby about it?” Oops.
 “Well, Ruby just talks.” “Mm-hm.” “So, some of the others… who, exactly?” He smirked.
 I’d given too much away.
 “You couldn’t tell by the way they looked at you in the clearing?” I had noticed.
 Anvil, Grey.

Jasmin elbowed me in the ribs, distracting me before I could start in on whomever it was that happened to be following along behind Cassie.
 "Just ignore them.
 Even Brandon won't try anything with this many witnesses around.
 It's just more dominance games."
 I nodded.
 It made sense, but it was all I could do to keep my eyes grounded despite the cold prickles running up and down my spine.
 Actual conversation was just too much, so I sat quietly with my head slightly bowed while the song ran its course.
 Alec's fingers gently pulled my chin up as the music ended.
 "Dance with me?"
 I mustered a brave smile as I nodded and let him lead me out onto the dance floor.

 “You’re Standing on my Train.”  Nice little number.
 Running Dog, Peabody and Sherman—that’s a funny story, really.
 They started at Peabody School, so that’s where the Peabody comes in, and the lead singer’s name was really Sherman.
 When they opened for us—I remember it was really fucking hot that night, one of those Memphis nights where the humidity feels like urine in the air—and they were talking to us backstage.
 And I said, I like your name—I’m a big Bulwinkle fan.
 They had no fucking idea what I was talking about.
 (laughs)  They really named themselves that with no knowledge of the cartoon at all.

 You never know when or if the perfect person will appear.

I knew Brandon couldn’t do this because he was too hot on the streets as a snitch.
 I pressed the issue, which was met with emphatic refusals each time.
 The officers continued to hold their ground and refused to agree to work with me.
 I pushed: “I don’t want you to work with me.
 I just want to know what you would do if I contacted you and told you that Steve was meeting me to buy one-hundred Oxys?
 What is your job responsibility in that case?” “We would do our job if someone called and informed us of a drug deal,” Officer White said.
 “If I am able to get Steve busted, would that count for my son’s deal?” I asked.
 The officer and his sergeant left the room for about ten minutes before returning to tell me that it would.
 “We are not condoning or encouraging this in any way,” Officer White insisted.
 That was all I needed.

Trading Jobs
 Those in the West who do not blame rising unemployment on technological advancement, usually blame it on trade.
 Business and economic literature is replete with articles stating that the high-wage industrial nations will suffer rising levels of unemployment due to the growth of imported goods from low-wage developing countries.
 The completion of the Uruguay round of GATT trade negotiations was delayed for years because this view fostered protectionist sentiment in the bastion of free trade Western nations.
 This issue elicits heated emotional debate that often overlooks obvious facts.
 For instance, increasing trade with East Asia and with low-wage developing countries is cited as a major cause of the fall in the wages of unskilled workers in the United States.
 As in the case of technology, there is evidence that free trade destroys jobs in some industries, especially unskilled or low-skilled jobs in high-wage economies.
 In some instances the devastating impact of increasing imports may justify a gradual approach to removing trade barriers.
 However, the overall impact of manufactured exports from developing countries has been vastly exaggerated.
 Exports by the Newly Industrializing Economies to the United States have risen from 1.1 to 2.1 per cent of US GNP over the past decade.

Her message always expresses or implies that by serving the poorest of the poor, the MCs minister to Christ in his distressing disguise.
 This morning she quoted, “For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me."
 She only spoke a few minutes, yet three times she asked that we pray for the MCs and the poorest of the poor.
 I joined the receiving line.
 As those of us standing went first, it only took a few minutes, during which I received the clarity to recognize that God, the source of all power, only works through people who stand aside and let him.
 Mother Teresa has built a mighty force of little, brown, meek, powerful women, because she knows and practices the art of humility, as perfectly as anyone I've witnessed.
 Her ego vanishes.
 God fills the vacuum.
 One of her warm hands touched mine and the other pressed my forehead.
 She smiled as poignantly as though I were her son, and her greatness revealed itself instantly.

I have refused her every time as I have told her that we will meet just the one time and exchange all the drugs for the money at once.
 She has tried to entice me with her young body in exchange for a couple Oxy, but I have resisted the temptation.
 The first time Ashley and I met I had the pleasure of seeing her naked body, but my goal is not to see it again, my goal is to do this drug deal.
 Her actions highlight that she is seriously addicted and that is not comforting when I am taking her word that Steve is a trustworthy drug dealer, as if there is such a thing.
 Another car approaches and it is white, but I cannot tell the make of the vehicle.
 As it passes, I check it out and see that it is a woman with two small children.
 She is handing a baby bottle towards a car seat in the back.
 A young boy sitting in the front passenger seat stares back at me as if to say, “What are you looking at?” I was once that baby in the backseat and my brother that inquisitive one in the front.
 My father wouldn’t have been in the car either.
 He disappeared long before I could commit him to my young memory.

Gorin lifted a large handle and solid squares of iron slid out of the floor and the ceiling.
 When both the top and the bottom fully released the guard pushed the doors wide.
 The three immediately pushed through and Rodregas said, “You can close the doors.
 I will pound on them when we are ready to leave.” And with a nervous nod the doors slid closed behind them.
 As the door closed Gorin hastily added, “Remember not to touch anything until the Grand Marshal is present.” Doi’van nodded at the now closed doors and raised his torch.
 The three gazed around the room in wonderment.
 In response to the torch the room seemed to respond with a vague light of its own, which came from all directions.
 The chamber was large with a tall vaulted ceiling like some temple, but no rows of seats or prayer mats did this temple hold.
 Instead it was filled with beasts; lions and wolves and the great mythical animals of the Celestial Realm.
 Most of these he recognized as the great totems of the Celestial Realm, each representing great power.

We couldn't explain our feelings to anyone else, but the four of us knew that we loved the four of us.
 When we laughed, we all laughed.
 We even cried together.
 "My own feelings toward Eric seemed to grow deeper within me until one day when I woke up and the sun looked ten times as bright, the sky bluer.
 And I knew.
 I knew.
 No adult, no matter how many years older than me, could tell me I was wrong.
 I knew I was very much in love with Eric.
 I thought of marriage, and that was when I saw what Eric was.
 He was the wind.

Ruby swirled into the room, dressed in a red frock of sorts.
 The color hurt my eyes.
 “Here, a bath will help.
 Come with me, dear.” Her hair was tied halfway back with a scarf, the tattered ends mingling with crimson curls.
 I felt dizzy again.
 She hauled me off the bed, supporting me as I stood.
 She was much smaller than I had thought, slipping easily under my arm.
 I kept my head down as we walked, mostly trying not to get ill, but also unable to look Steed in the eyes.
 I watched Ruby’s heeled boots as she led me through the main room and to the door to her bedroom.
 “A bath?” I asked, confused.

I was not aware that any of the Knights of the Order were implicated.” Taiga smiled and waved a hand in a dismissing motion.
 “Oh, don’t misjudge my words.
 I did not mean to imply any misdeeds of our valiant Knights of the Soaring Heavens.
 I am not aware of any of them doing much of anything, much less kill an Immortalist.” “Than what should I keep my eye out for?” asked Van’dret.
 He was becoming even more curious to the direction of the conversation.
 “You, my fine Van’dret, are more in the world than most of us.
 You are out traveling and adventuring, while most of us Immortalist just sit in our towers.
 I have always thought that our one weakness was our isolation.
 It is hard to know what is exactly happening when we are not out to see it.”  For a moment, Taiga paused, looking up at the crystal roof overhead in apparent contemplation of the possible implications of their isolated natures.
 After a moment, in which Van’dret waited patiently, Taiga continued, “You are one of our best, and yet you are also in the world.

International debt relief has helped ten, mostly middle-income, debtor countries significantly reduce their commercial debt.
 Past actions to relieve the debt burden on low-income countries have been relatively small in relation to the amount of debt, which has continued to rise under the combined impact of accumulated interest arrears on old loans, falling export commodity prices, and new compensatory loans, frequently given on expensive terms.
 Unrealistic pressure to repay debt undermines debtors' capacity for constructive initiative.
 Past experience has shown that mere debt rescheduling in these countries does not solve the problem and may in fact aggravate it.
 The extent of the problem is reflected in the heavily discounted prices of the debts of countries with low and lower-middle incomes in the secondary market and in negotiated buy-outs of the debt owed to commercial creditors.
 In 1993, the average market price of the debt was about 30 cents on the dollar.
 This market discount was a major factor in the decision to scale down the debt of Latin American countries by an average of 15 per cent and of Egypt and Poland by 50 per cent.
 The aggregate debt of the 61 debt-affected countries with low and lower-middle income is roughly equal to that of the half-dozen mostly middle-income countries assisted under the Brady Plan.
 Scaling down the debt of these poor countries by an average of 70 per cent would be appropriate in view of their economic plight, though the actual reduction would have to be negotiated on a case by case basis.
 In order to be of sufficient magnitude, debt reduction should be applied to all three major classes of creditors: bilateral official creditors, private sector lenders and international organizations.

“Why did you save me?”
 He kicked his toes into the dirt, unable to piece together the chaotic mess inside his head and heart.
 All he could think of was what his brother had told him to do.
 “Qurrah said to kill you if I didn’t love you…”
 “Yet you didn’t,” she said.
 Harruq nodded, but said nothing else.
 “ _Hana fael!_ ” a voice cried from far down the alley.
 Both turned to see an elf raise his bow and fire.
 “Look out,” Aurelia said, shoving Harruq aside.
 The arrow hit her breast and reflected off as if hitting stone.

This strategy utilizes agriculture as an engine for growth by accelerating the development of commercial agriculture, agro-industry and agro-exports.
 It calls for a shift in thinking concerning agriculture from production for survival and subsistence to production for maximum and sustainable profit, from emphasis on meeting minimum needs to realizing maximum potentials, from commodity-based to resource-based planning.
 It seeks to tap the country's competitive advantage in labour-intensive agricultural crops and allied industries to double agricultural production - raising the annual growth rate to 4 per cent (versus 2.3 per cent in the 1980s) - achieve complete nutritional self-sufficiency, raise rural incomes and double India's total exports.
 Creating new jobs through this low-cost strategy can be accomplished entirely with the country's own resources, though foreign firms will find investment in India's agro-industrial sector very attractive.
 Initially, about half of the new jobs will be generated on farms by raising productivity through methods to improve management of micro-nutrients and water, expanding the total irrigated area by more complete utilization of the substantial additional capacity that has already been created, emphasis on more labour-intensive commercial crops such as sugar, cotton, fruit, flowers, and vegetables, sericulture, inland and coastal aquaculture, reclamation of wastelands for forestry and fodder, and increasing subsidiary incomes from animal husbandry and poultry.
 The expansion and intensification of cultivation of these products will raise agricultural output by $25 billion and generate approximately 45 million equivalent full-time unskilled and semi-skilled jobs in agriculture for unemployed and under-employed farmers and landless labour.
 The additional agricultural production will form raw material for expansion of rural industrialization and non-farm employment.
 Another 10 million jobs will be created in downstream agro-industries located in rural areas - in sugar mills, cotton and textile mills, processing units for fruit, fish and silk, and in marketing and distribution - thus serving as a counter-magnet to urban migration.
 Growth of agro-industry will stimulate demand for industrial machinery and services.
 The multiplier effect of skyrocketing rural demand will stimulate demand in a broad range of consumer industries and create an estimated 45 million rural and urban jobs in industry and services.

She froze in place.
 What if she got back to 1927 today?
 She wouldn't get to go to Hollywood.
 Dropping into a chair, she drew her legs up and wrapped her arms around her knees.
 She wanted to go to Hollywood more than she'd ever wanted anything.
 Well, not more than she wanted to go home.
 She was having fun here, but it was as if she were on holiday.
 She missed her mother and father and friends, and she didn't think she could bear it if she thought she'd never get back.
 What if she skipped her walk in the garden today and today turned out to be her chance to get back?
 But she knew that no one in 1927 was going to take her to Hollywood.

She smiled at Marie.
 "Cute dress."
 Marie glanced down at her dress before responding with a puzzled, "Thank you."
 She knew it definitely wasn't in fashion now.
 A little while later Marie took the jeans and several blouses into the dressing room, removing her dress and putting on her favorite of the blouses, a navy blue one with red stripes.
 It was so soft!
 After admiring it in the mirror for a moment, she reached for the smaller pair of trousers.
 The material felt comfortable, but they were so tight!
 Were they supposed to be this tight?
 Rick would know.

 Johnny – Who do you know who had it worse than me?
 It’s not like I’m complaining about nothing.

So he goes and gets killed on my birthday.
 What’s that mean?” I shrugged.
 We hugged stiffly.
 Then we parted and went our own ways.
 A few minutes later, I stumbled into my mom’s classroom at La Mesa Junior High School, while Billy and Cliff waited in my car.
 My mom was lecturing about prepositions.
 After a minute, she issued a reading assignment, followed me to a patio behind her room, and collapsed onto the picnic bench when I told her Eric was dead.
 “Oh God,” she moaned.
 “Not again.” Cliff, Billy and I drove to their home.
 We spent an hour or so on an art project they were creating.

For me it's always been way too much time crammed into a relatively small space with fifty or sixty other people and no bathroom.
 Still, if any bus trip is going to be fun, it'd be this one."
 Rachel handed me my last book, and waved to Isaac, who was just now getting up from his table.
 "Hello, Adriana.
 I assume you'll need a ride home today?"
 It was the first time Isaac had actually spoken to me, and I was surprised at how well-spoken he was.
 His voice sounded like a superbly-tuned cello.
 I filed the information away as further evidence he wasn't really our age.
 "Yes please, Brandon can only take me home on Tuesdays and Thursdays."
 It wasn't my imagination; Isaac flinched slightly, and Rachel's smile momentarily turned plastic.

The music of the planets.
 I listened to it alone in my parent’s living room, hearing sounds that transformed me as surely as did Lorelei, the finding of my own voice.
 “Talkin World War III Blues” was beyond my ken.
 I thought, perhaps, my head would explode.
 I didn’t understand.
 In my reptile brain I have also the memory of my friend Ricky Adams’ big brother having “folk” albums, some by a handsome, young, angular-faced singer named Bob Dylan, whose songs were meant as social anthems, wrong-righters.
 I didn’t know what to make of these threnodies.
 They were so stark, so naked.
 It was just a man’s voice, crying in the wilderness.
 This must have been shit, what?

Even through the World Series, she hardly watched an inning on television.
 She preferred the dark and her radio.
 That year, the Yankees won in five games.
 The following week my mom stayed home from her job, teaching eighth-grade English.
 Her headache was so wicked, she grimaced and groaned.
 I tried to coax her to the doctor.
 She said he had already given her pain pills, which was all he could do.
 Then I came home from school and found her lying in a heap beside her bed.
 Breathing in shallow puffs, eyes open and watery.
 Above the right eye was a long gash, already scabbed over.

They might hurt her.
 Please, help us!”
 “There’s two,” shouted one of the farmers.
 “They killed my wife!
 You have to…”
 Their words trailed off once they were close enough to see clearly.
 Flesh hung from their bones, pale and rotting.
 Wounds spotted nearly every one, although no blood poured from them.
 Their saviors were men, orc, and elf, but they were dead.
 “Ashhur help us,” an exhausted farmer murmured before the line advanced upon them.

He looked like some kind of pagan god, smeared all over with blood, an uneven circle drawn on his chest, filled with sharp, angry lines that didn't mean anything to me, but which made the wolves around me tense and growl.
 "While I appreciate the sentiment, it really is far too late to secure absolution by bringing me the girl."
 His voice had changed, becoming deeper and harsher, with elements that didn't sound like they could come from any human throat.
 He stepped forward, and I felt my chest seize up.
 The transformation I'd sensed the beginnings of at the dance had run its course now and any question as to why someone as cultured as Brandon would associate with a near-psychopath like Vincent was put to rest.
 He was shaking now, quivering with the need to kill, and I realized that it didn't matter whether the darkness inside Brandon had created Vincent or just attracted him to orbit in his sphere like a small moon.
 It was enough to know that Vincent's was the lesser evil.
 "Adri is here solely as a witness."
 Alec's voice was huskier than normal, but still carried most of its velvety perfection.
 As I looked at him, I realized I wasn't feeling any power arcing from him.

He spoke the words and poured his power into them.
 He felt his body shift, and his sight twisted so that he saw many things.
 A spider, he thought.
 Velixar should have told him it was like becoming a spider.
 A mere thought of moving sent him spiraling, reappearing place to place.
 Ending the spell left him totally disoriented.
 His sight returned to normal, and it felt a little like falling from a very tall tree.
 As he retched on his knees, he looked about, discerning his location.
 He was beside the building the two elves were in, directly underneath their windows.
 He could see the tips of their arrows sticking out, glinting in torchlight.

His legs tucked underneath him and pushed, shooting him back to his feet.
 Out came his swords.
 Standing before him was Dieredon, his bow held in both hands like a staff.
 Long blades stretched out from either end, tiny razor teeth lining the front.
 The elf twirled the bow in his hands and then charged.
 Two quick hits batted one of Harruq’s swords out and away.
 A feint, so quick Harruq blocked on instinct, took care of the other.
 His weapons gone, the half-orc was exposed.
 Dieredon wasted no time smashing the half-orc’s groin.
 As he doubled over in pain, a snap kick smacked his chin, splattering blood and forcing him to drop.

“How old were you then?” Velixar asked.
 “Nine,” Qurrah said.
 The man in black shook his head.
 His expression showed there would be no further argument.
 “If you had been mine at the age of nine…‌ my previous apprentice Xelrak held but a shred of your strength.”
 Qurrah straightened at the name.
 “I have heard of Xelrak.
 He toppled the Citadel.”
 Velixar smiled as he remembered a cherished memory.
 “Indeed.

"They-they aren't in style here."
 She thought of the shorts and jeans and white sundress Rick had bought her.
 She definitely wouldn't have had any use for them here.
 And of course, the bathing suit.

 He'd told her she was beautiful and sexy.
 "Marie?"
 "Hmmm?"

I looked up to see several people leaving.
 Steed?
 Grey?
 I fought panic as I wondered if they’d all made it.
 The worry throbbed in my head; it felt like my mind could splinter.
 I checked the faces close to me for stress but could see none.
 Ruby’s smile was soft.
 “How do you feel?” I was having trouble forming a simple answer.
 There didn’t seem to be a word for it in the disorder of my brain.
 My silence was answer enough.

Everyone starts to dive for cover.
 I am seated next to Grandpa but I am now flat on the ground with the rest of the crowd attempting to duck the flying flowers, tripods, and debris, expecting a shower of bullets.
 Chairs are scattering as they tip over and who knows what those two men in the helicopter are going to do?
 I look up and the only man standing is Grandpa who has his arms in the air as the wind from the copter pounds him and ripples his suit like a flag in the wind.
 This deeply religious (and senile) old man proclaims loudly “the lord has come to take my son!” and he continues to repeat this line as if he is a TV preacher in a revival tent.
 I have an eye on the copter and a hand on Grandpa’s leg as I attempt to pull him to the ground with the rest of us.
 People are barely audible but they are screaming and crying and in total panic.
 The men reach inside the helicopter and they hold what appear to be large boxes.
 They turn the boxes over in all this mayhem; something dumps out in large clumps banging down on the top of the cars and limos they hover over.
 The loud bangs cause those who aren’t looking to think they are explosions or gunfire.

The roar of some kind of high-performance engine a few seconds later almost changed my mind, but my native stubbornness kicked in before I let the thought get out of hand.
 The subject matter was harder than graphing, but I persevered, and managed to make it through all fifteen problems without resorting to the red side of the card.
 Of course Albert did stop by to see if I was having any difficulties, but since I didn't summon him, he couldn't read anything into it.
 When Britney stomped over and asked if I was done, I considered telling her I needed ten more minutes.
 Her being an attention hog didn't justify me being petty though.
 I just nodded instead and packed up my stuff.
 The ride home was completely uneventful, and mercifully brief.
 Britney was one of those people who drive fast normally, and even faster when they are pissed off.
 Apparently having to stay after school to study merited twenty-five over the speed limit.
 I normally would have complained--I'd become much more sensitive about speeding in the last couple of months, but I was anxious to get home, and very much not feeling like there was anything particularly special to live for.

It'd become nearly passé to wake up emotionally exhausted from what should have been a restful night, but these dreams had been different.
 I'd played out nearly every possible combination of events since the accident.
 Dreams where I was the one driving instead of Cindi.
 Dreams where I got a ride home with someone so Dad and Cindi didn't have any reason to be on the road.
 Dreams where I was in the truck that killed them, even dreams where I was in the back seat as a passenger at the moment of impact.
 I was used to awaking shaking and scared countless times during the course of a night, but I'd never felt that level of pure, bestial fear.
 I stumbled into the bathroom and flipped on the light, only to groan at how ghastly I looked.
 I was even paler than normal, with dark circles under my eyes that only a crack addict could possibly find attractive.
 A hot shower did a little to make me more presentable, I tried to hide the shadows with some makeup, and then finally gave up after botching the second application, and just put on some mascara and eyeliner.
 The mundane process of getting ready for the day wore away some of the edge to my nightmare.

People die from cigarettes.
 But more die from fettered ambition.
 I heard my dad’s band exactly once.
 I don’t remember why.
 We had to go to The Vapors for something and mom plunked me down in a chair and said, just stay here, I’ll be back.
 Well, it was like the music held me there—she could have been gone for hours.
 I was riveted.
 And there was my dad, looking cool, and blowing beautiful, liquid melodies out of that licorice stick.

The euphoria of those heady days generated high expectations of a peace dividend that would help to wipe away much of the world’s suffering.
 At the same time, the withdrawal of the confrontation between East and West resulted in a gradual shift of attention from the threat of imminent global self-destruction to lesser but very real problems, among them – the unresolved danger arising from huge stockpiles of nuclear weapons; some 26 on-going localized military conflicts within and between developing nations, aggravated by increased trafficking in small armaments; the persistence of hunger and malnutrition, especially among the poorest populations of South Asia and politically unstable regions of Africa; progressively rising levels of unemployment in both industrialized and developing countries; and the turbulence and hardship of political, economic and social transition in post-Communist Eastern Europe.
 These challenges, coupled with the outbreak of the first Gulf War, the disintegration of Yugoslavia, and the horrendous civil wars that wracked Somalia and Rwanda, clouded the world’s vision of a brighter future.
 It was in this context that the Commission undertook five years of research that led to the publication of its report in the fall of 1994.
 The report was released at official functions at UN headquarters in New York, UNESCO in Paris, a global congress of the World Academy of Art and Science at Minneapolis, and in the restored capital of a reunited Germany at Berlin, then formally presented to the UN Secretary General and to all UN member nations by a member of the Commission, Her Majesty Queen Noor on behalf of the Government of Jordan.
 In the decade since then, much has happened to belie the expectations of post-Cold War optimists and pessimists alike.
 On the positive side, the sudden emergence and explosive growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web have fuelled a global revolution in communication, education, economy and a wide range of human activities reaching from corporate board rooms in North America to rural towns and villages on every continent, abridging the time, distance and differences separating countries, classes and people.
 The end of Apartheid in South Africa completed a century-long struggle, ridding the world of a horrible scourge.
 Democratic systems of governance characterized by the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free media replaced dictatorships around the world.
 The establishment of the World Trade Organization paved the way for expanded markets for both developing and developed countries, fuelled a rapid expansion in World Trade, and wove strong bonds of interdependence between erstwhile antagonists across the globe from the Chinese mainland to North America.

If I wrote what people told me to write I’d still be doing “Open Channel D.”
 CM:  	Great song.
 BG: 	It’s a fucking great song.
 Of course, it is.
 But, still, do you say to Larry Rivers, do that Washington thing again?
 Do you tell Jasper Johns to stop painting flags, or keep painting flags, or whatever?
 Tell Dylan, write another “Rolling Stone.”  I mean, hell, that’s why artists are artists, they’re going places, traveling, leaving the cave to seek the truth, man, not to join other seekers.
 Like Townshend said.
 I don’t care, man.
 I don’t care.

He was holding someone by the arm, preventing them from running away.
 Suddenly, my vision changed and I was a hawk, attacking, tearing a piece from his tongue.
 And Chevelle.
 He was in so many of my dreams.
 We were sparring sometimes, clashing swords.
 Sometimes he was pummeling me with rocks.
 Other times, the moments would have surely made me blush, if I could have felt my cheeks.
 He held my face in his hands, declaring his need for me.
 “I have wanted you since the moment I first saw you.” But the word burned.
 Wanted.

Other than that things are great."
 Alec's chuckle seemed to reach out and caress me.
 "I take it you'd be up for a brief field trip then?"
 My ears must have perked up.
 For all that we'd spent an incredible amount of time together over the last little bit, he hadn't taken me anywhere.
 "A field trip sounds great.
 Except I have to be back at least three hours before the dance, or Rachel and Jasmin will eat me.
 At least that's what they said, and I tend to believe them."
 Alec crossed over to me and ran a finger down the side of my face.
 "Only you could manage to make a joke out of having fallen in with monsters."

My arms were covered in tree bark, blending seamlessly with the stump on which I sat.
 I bolted upright, batting at them as if my shirt were on fire.
 Chevelle and the cloaked woman ran toward me and I looked up in panic.
 When my eyes fell again to my arms, they were normal.
 Had I imagined it?
 Was I losing my mind?
 My head came up once more, and the woman gasped.
 It was Junnie.
 Her cloak had fallen, her golden curls a welcome sight.
 Relief flooded me.

Don’t make it all for nothing.”
 Harruq’s anger and frustration simmered and swirled in a dying fire.
 He could not argue with her, not about that.
 Even he could see what she had sacrificed to save his life.
 “Where do we go?” he asked, his voice revealing his defeat.
 “We’ll figure it out in the morning.
 For now, we travel north.
 Your brother will be fine, I promise.”
 He nodded but said nothing.
 The two traveled in between the hills, exhausted but unwilling to stop their movement.

The nicest tools were in a cabinet, and with a grunt (it was heavy even for him) he picked it up and loaded it into the cart, along with some other useful implements.
 He would need to carry as much food as possible as well.
 He quickly went back into the main keep and wrapped up the mattress from Captain Poir’s bunk and started carrying barrels of flour and other foodstuffs to his pile next to the front entrance.
 The drudge stared at him with a strange look but did not question his actions.
 He then realized that he should go up and check out the laboratory for anything else of value, and check out the dungeon to make sure all the prisoners had been freed.
 He had brought a proper crow bar from his visit to the smith’s and made short work of the laboratory door.
 The room had several large circles in the floor and tables and shelves along the side.
 The shelves held bones and bowls of strange fluids and other items whose uses he could not imagine.
 Anything that felt foul he threw into the fireplace, after getting a good flame going.
 Several books and strange containers ended up in the fire, though he did find two books that felt of magic that he kept.

Without another word he strode out.
 Imeralda followed him as did all the squire’s attendants.
 It was time for the final match.
 Rodregas left his shield and mace relaxed at his side and strode over to Nordien, who stood with shield and mace at the ready.
 Instead of attacking he asked the big man, “So, are people right, do you plan to serve the Immortalists if you gain the greater sigil?” The squire looked around a little confused.
 He was clearly not expecting a conversation, but no one was near enough to hear.
 “The Immortalists are the true power of the realm.
 To tie ones self to them is only smart,” Nordien responded.
 “So, you do not deny it,” said Rodregas.
 “It is not to a squire that I am going to either admit or deny such claims.

"No, if they were hanging around outside we'd be able to smell them."
 "So not only are you faster and stronger than normal people, you've also got noses like real wolves?"
 "Of a sort.
 That's not really important though.
 Let's get you inside."
 I nodded and started towards the door, only to blink as Alec stepped in front of me.
 "May I have permission to enter and make sure it's safe inside?"
 I slowed down, suddenly terrified at the thought of Brandon and his friends waiting inside for me.
 "I thought you said you'd be able to smell them if they were here."
 "If they were outside, yes.

 Let her go.
 Move on.
 Johnny – Why should I?
 She made my life a miserable hell.
 Jim – She was almost as bad for dad and me.
 We’ve let her go, you need to too.
 Otherwise she’ll keep on making your life a life hell.
 Johnny – She didn’t do half of what she did to you as she did to me.

 Jim – Unless a tornado drops one on him.
 Liz – That won’t happen.
 We haven’t had a tornado here in 50 years at least.
 Johnny – Very funny.

He simply rode as he always did, with intermittent glances in each direction, as if I weren’t even there.
 In truth, he hadn’t appeared to notice my behavior at all.
 When I finally broke the silence, we were navigating a narrow pass.
 “How long will we be riding?” I wasn’t specific in my question, not wanting to reveal I had no idea where we were headed.
 If he’d been under the false impression he’d had to take me, I wasn’t about to mess that up only to be dragged back to the village.
 Especially after everything that had happened.
 My horse quickened his pace to ride alongside his and I made a mental note to learn how to control the horse on my own.
 The constricted path forced us close together, our stirrups and legs brushing as we rode.
 Chevelle nodded at my hand and I held it out, palm up.
 Chevelle indicated a spot on one of the mountains.

Existing weapons would be destroyed or turned over to the peace force.
 As in NATO, members would agree by treaty to consider an attack on one member as an attack on all.
 The peace force would intervene automatically and unconditionally – defensively and, if necessary, offensively – to protect the sovereignty and international borders of any member country, provided that it conformed to the rules under the charter.
 The organization could also assist members in fighting drug trafficking and terrorist activities.
 The benefits of this cooperative peace-keeping mechanism would be manifold:
 Since the charter would bind members and the alliance to eschew the use of force and aggression for any reason, it would represent a stabilizing, non-provocative, non-offensive defence.
 Its charter could also include specific provisions for close association with other international forces.
 Its combined strength and technological capabilities would exceed those of any of its members and constitute a substantial deterrent to aggression against any member country.
 It would significantly reduce the costs of security for members, possibly by up to 50 or 75 per cent, without compromising their legitimate security needs.
 The more members, the lower the defence expenditure required by each, both because the collective force would be larger and because the number of potential adversaries would be reduced proportionately.

Even comparing areas under irrigated maize, average yields range from 1.5 to 8.4 tons per hectare.
 New varieties of maize are under development that yield 30 per cent more grain in a drought season than conventional varieties.
 They could be especially effective in lowland tropics, including much of Africa.
 Potato yields in Belgium and the Netherlands are roughly three times the world average.
 This productivity gap between what is routinely achieved by different countries represents a vast immediate potential for improving yields that does not require significant additional investment of time or money in R & D. The world already possesses the knowledge, technology and organizational capacities to raise considerably average world yields in major crops.
 Emphasizing cultivation practices
 The phenomenal increases in productivity achieved over the past three decades through the development of improved and hybrid varieties of seeds have over shadowed and distracted attention from the equally great potential of raising yields through improvements in methods of cultivation.
 This is especially true since much of the slowdown in productivity growth is attributable to depletion of soil and water resources, which can be partially rectified or offset by improved practices.
 Growing environmental concerns in the West have generated pressure for reducing fertilizer consumption in developing countries, when in most instances fertilizer application levels are lower than those in Western Europe by a factor of five or ten times.
 Increased, rather than reduced, use of chemical fertilizers will be essential to the expansion of agriculture in these countries and can considerably increase crop yields.

Not far from their home, a ratty building operated throughout the night.
 It was Maggie’s Place, half tavern and half orphanage.
 Maggie enjoyed the free labor and the ability to rant and slap her orphan workers without fear of reprisal while still maintaining the image of a heart of gold to her regulars.
 The tavern filled the first floor, while the orphanage and a few modest rooms for rent composed the second.
 Harruq stepped into the alley beside the tavern and looked up.
 A window.
 Perfect.
 As he searched for a way to scale the wall, he saw a drunken man watching him.
 “Get lost,” Harruq growled.
 The man obliged, taking his bottle of ale and running.

Mrs. Campbell either understood what I was trying to accomplish, or was saving up all her venom for after class.
 She didn't call on me even once.
 Britney wasn't so lucky, and I caught a nasty look from her each time I surfaced from my textbook.
 The glares angered me more than I'd expected.
 I was having to catch up on a month's worth of assignments; she didn't have any right to get pissy just because she wasn't prepared.
 The third time it happened, I stopped pretending not to notice and shot Britney a sugar-sweet look of my own.
 She didn't quite seem to know how to take that and the rest of the class passed quickly.
 All too soon, it was time to go up and talk to Mrs. Campbell.
 I put off the ordeal as long as I could, waiting until everyone but Britney and I had exited the room.
 Britney looked particularly unhappy.

No sooner has she begun the telling, than Curly wanders off.
 Later I'll notice her on a couch close by, reading a book, or maybe pretending while she keeps watch over her friend, who no doubt is considered wacky by many, for reasons her story will clarify.
 A few years ago, she began to feel that something evil was inside her.
 “It wasn’t demonic,” she assures me.
 And it isn’t any part of her basic nature, she believes.
 Over some months, through prayer and meditation, she came to believe that evil itself had invaded the world and entered people, and God had allowed this to happen, which led her to a certainty that we are now living in the world’s final days.
 Powered by these revelations, she prayed with intensity and perseverance.
 And God responded by urging her to give herself entirely to him.
 She assured him she was all his.
 For some weeks, he allowed her to rest on that answer, but more and more she became uneasy with it, until she realized she didn’t by any means belong entirely to God.

The faint light revealed worry on Chevelle’s face as he stood over me.
 A look of fear and sympathy.
 The memory smashed into my chest like a thousand-pound ram, stealing my breath.
 “You,” I hissed.
 He backed away as I sat up and glared at him with fire in my eyes.
 “You.
 You held me back as my mother died.
 You held me and made me watch her die.” I could almost taste the acid in my voice.
 He was still backing away, holding his hands in front of him palms out.
 A wordless hiss escaped my throat as I felt the fire coursing through me light in my hands.

I view Velixar as sort of a recruiter, the kind of man who’d be right at home at a Nazi rally filling confused kids with bigotry, anger, and murder.
 He is gone, for now anyway, and in The Cost of Betrayal these two brothers will get a chance to live on their own.
 For once Harruq has not only felt regret but done something about it.
 For once Qurrah has seen that the darkness he follows is not the absolute power it claims to be.
 This Half-Orc Series is a story of redemption.
 I will not tell it in just one book, not even in two or three.
 People will die, and I will break the hearts of my beloved creations.
 If you’ve read this far and enjoyed it, I welcome you to continue along with me, as well as thank you for your readership.

Harruq began his story.
 He told her of a gift from his brother, a tiny sword Qurrah had whittled from bone.
 A bully had stolen it, but then Qurrah used a dead rat under his control to steal it back while they slept.
 The haircut and the story ended at the same time.
 Dirty hair was strewn over the grass.
 “Never had much,” Harruq said.
 “That bone sword was my only possession.
 Still had to hide it because of that bully.
 You know, it’s probably still there, buried underneath our home.”
 “You and your brother had such rough beginnings,” Aurelia said, tucking away the dagger.

 “Did you practice the spells I taught you?” Velixar asked as Qurrah took his seat by the fire.
 “Yes,” Qurrah said.
 “I am more than pleased with them.”
 “You will need to keep a fresh supply of bones with you,” Velixar said, reaching into his pouch.
 “Take these for now until you can obtain more.”
 Qurrah accepted the bones, stashing them into a small pocket he had sewn onto his robe.
 A silence fell over the two as far away a wolf howled.

But I was neither that cold-blooded nor that stuck on Liz.
 She might be as pretty, but if she possessed any goodness like what I saw in Karen, she hid it deep.
 Prom night, for reasons more complicated than I can remember so long, Cliff was driving a '49 Ford convertible that belonged to Bob Williams, whom I will visit in Portland a few days from now.
 Cliff's date was Chris Latin.
 Karen and I rode in the back seat.
 Karen had a cold.
 Maybe her reason for keeping her distance, physical and otherwise, was hygienic concern for my health.
 Or maybe she didn't approve of my dating Liz.
 Whatever the truth, she wounded my already tenderized feelings.
 For a while during the after-prom at a bowling alley, I left her and found Margaret.

Now was time to give in to their most primal needs.
 For one last moment he held her back, slowing her movements.
 He was a little worried that she would have trouble handling his size, but she literally started bouncing on his lap and his own groans joined hers and he stopped thinking and gave himself to the pleasure of the moment.
 Afterwards, well… after several afterwards, they were curled up on her mattress.
 Rodregas was very happy he had salvaged the mattress from Captain Poir.
 He had had no way to know that the mattress was going to come in so handy.
 He lay there with Imeralda's head laying on his shoulder and her body half draped on his own and half on the mattress, he was thankful that Doi’van had clearly heard what was going on.
 Rodregas assumed he must have slept back in the barn.
 Doi’van walking in unaware of the situation would have been very embarrassing.
 Rodregas had suggested to Imeralda that they should stop in case Doi’van walked in, but she had shown no signs of caring and quickly took the thought away from him with her actions.

And if the spell went wrong?
 I tested the spell on Rain last night.
 I’m not sure what went amiss, but she convulsed for hours before she fell into a sleep.
 She finally rose late this morning, but she couldn’t remember who she was and she kept scratching at her face until it bled.
 At least she’ll not be able to tell anyone I did it.
 I’ll have to catch another servant tonight.
 No, I had a feeling he’d not be using one of our group.
 I was starting to get sleepy, but didn’t want to put the book down.
 This one worked.
 Dree’s nose bled for the first few minutes but after that she slept soundly and woke just before noon not knowing she had missed anything.

Mother, I'd like to invite her over for dinner tonight if that's all right.
 I'd like for her and Marie to get to know each other better."
 "Why don't we wait until tomorrow?
 I think we should give Marie a chance to rest and readjust."
 "I'm fine."
 "No, Mother's right.
 Tomorrow will be better."
 They ate lunch at 12:30, and Marie could tell that both men were feeling a little restless.
 "Why don't you two go to the office for a few hours?"
 she suggested.

She glanced up at him.
 "It's so hard to pretend we don't live together."
 He kissed her hair.
 "That's because it's become so natural to you."
 Rick sat in a chair across from Marie rather than joining her on the loveseat so that they wouldn't appear too familiar with each other.
 He was glad his conscience had gotten the best of him and kept him from seducing her Monday night.
 If having Teri and Jeremy suspect that they were living together embarrassed her, losing her virginity before marriage would devastate her.
 "So how did you like my sister?"
 Rick asked Marie when their guests had left.
 "She's really nice.

The spirit gave no answer.
 The half-orc stood, his hands clenched into fists.
 He hooked them through the air as he repeated his question.
 “Was it willing or not?” he demanded.
 “Yes,” Ahrqur whispered, grimacing as if filled with horrid pain.
 “When she approached me, I offered no resistance.
 Now will you let me return to peace?”
 “Not yet.
 Harruq, would you like to tell him?”
 Ahrqur glanced at Harruq, who was grinning wide.

 Jim – And hope that he spontaneously combusts.
 Johnny – Spontaneously combusts.
 Liz – Which is about as likely as his getting hit by a train while he’s sitting in his living room.
 Johnny – You’re a lot of help.
 Jim – What can I say?

Before his conversion, in the aftermath of a duel, “’Gentlemen,’ I cried suddenly, speaking straight from my heart, ‘look around you at the gifts of God, the clear sky, the pure air, the tender grass, the birds; nature is beautiful and sinless, and we, only we, are sinful and foolish, and we don’t understand that life is heaven, for we have only to understand that and it will at once be fulfilled in all its beauty, and we shall embrace each other and weep.’”
 Darkness
 For the first time in weeks, a deep sadness grips me.
 Where is it coming from, I wonder?
 After a while, I give up wondering and pray for an answer.
 When no answer arrives, I decide to track my thoughts backward, which leads me to the source, which was a recognition that I had lived much of my life in the aftermath of a grievous mistake.
 If I hadn't been so stubborn, if I had trusted God from the time I first believed, I might've spent all these years in a richer world, maybe not living every moment in the kingdom of heaven, but residing close enough so I could visit more regularly.
 And I might've done a lot of good for other people.
 In this sorry condition, I decide that my darkest sin, the one so loathsome I should never stop grieving over it, isn't any of the wicked stuff I have thought or done.
 My darkest sin is failing to do all the thousands of good works I could have done for people.

I tried to recall, though still clouded with fog, the magic I’d seen in the village.
 The youngsters played, careless with the use, often until they collapsed from exhaustion.
 But the elders, they were reserved.
 I couldn’t think of them using it for anything that could be done with less physical energy.
 They hunted with weapons, wrote with their hands, worked as if they took pleasure in it.
 Was there no energy left for magic?
 Or was it not important until you reached the close of your years and realized it was almost gone?
 I remembered how long a thousand years had seemed to me before I planned on spending it in a prison.
 Ruby walked in and I snapped the book shut, positive I shouldn’t have taken it from her table without permission.
 One glance at her stifled reaction and I knew I’d not be able to ask her about what I’d read.

My heart actually skipped a beat.
 That was more than some people spent on their first car.
 "Rachel, you've already bought me way too much.
 I can't let you get this.
 Not only will I never wear it, you could practically feed small countries with what you'd have to pay for all this."
 She started to pout, but I'd already been taken by that tactic once today, and caving in had just landed me in deeper trouble.
 "I'm serious, Rachel; we are not walking out of the store with this dress.
 You can throw a temper tantrum if you want, but I'm not giving in."
 Rachel glared at me for several seconds, and then suddenly smiled.
 "Okay, Adri.

"You didn't miss anything," Rick told Marie, setting the article aside.
 "Scientists think that it would be possible to travel through time by going through these wormholes the author mentions, but it's all theory.
 Nobody has ever discovered a wormhole, and none of this stuff has ever been proven."
 Marie sighed.
 "This book isn't hard to follow, but I'm rather skeptical.
 The author says that thought is the way to travel through time.
 He says that if you concentrate hard enough on getting to the time you want to visit, you can do it."
 "Yeah, I found some ideas about that in the other books I read.
 Maybe--" "But that doesn't explain how I came here.
 I wasn't thinking about 2011."

Maybe “Train Time,” maybe that incredible mélange Townshend put together for Live at Leeds.
 And, let me add here, that I got a call from Pete, it was in, oh, 1969 or so, and he’d gotten a copy of the album—God knows where—and he was agog at that cut, he asked me how I got the distort sound on my guitar.
 Pete Fucking Townshend, man.
 CM:  	Wow.
 How did you get that sound?
 BG:  	Jim’s idea.
 From “Rocket 88” of course, everyone knows that story.
 Jim kicked in my amp.
 I was dumbfounded—he was like some shaman so I didn’t protest—and that hole in the amp is what gives my guitar such a weird sound on that cut.
 I had a fuzz pedal too—a Pep box, and an Astrotone, but, Jim wanted that Memphis thing, you know, he wanted to tie us into the whole mojo, from Sun, from Ike Turner, through Keith Richards on “Satisfaction”—which is a cop from Sam, don’t let anyone tell you different, through the swamp music of Mudboy—up to us.

I mean, why she's the way she is?"
 Definitely not a time for funniness apparently.
 "What do you mean?
 I've only met her the one time.
 She seemed normal enough.
 I guess a little distracted..." The chuckle I'd been waiting for surfaced, but it wasn't at all like his normal laugh.
 It was as if someone had sucked all of the joy and goodness out of the sound I'd grown to crave on a nearly subconscious level, and left a twisted shell.
 "She's definitely distracted.
 You could even say utterly disconnected from the world.
 Completely free from the present, always living in the past."

They prompt us to strive for the maximum that is conceivable, rather than the mini mum that is achievable.
 Values form the basis for the tremendous developmental achievements of the past two hundred years, such as the Japanese commitment to teamwork and consensus, the American devotion to enterprise and innovation, the German dedication to quality, and the Dutch commitment to partnership with other people, rather than exploitation.
 Development is retarded by the slow pace at which new values are acquired, which normally requires a change of generation.
 But values can also be consciously transmitted through education in order to abridge the time needed for transition.
 The efforts over the last ten years to implement the value of environmental security illustrate the range of knowledge, information, attitudes, institutions, systems, and skills needed to achieve any high value in life.
 The recommendations presented in this report are intended to form a basis for identifying and providing the values, attitudes, organizations and skills needed to achieve peace and prosperity at the dawn of the third millennium.
 It is well known that societies which are able to harness their cultural energies for development tend to progress very rapidly.
 Yet at the same time, we know that cultural factors can also be a barrier to rapid progress.
 Clinging to the external forms and norms of behaviour which distinguish one culture from another generates resistance to progress, whereas the inner content of culture is a powerful engine for collective achievement.
 Customs are the external form of culture, values are the inner content.

It seemed like a crime to deny her, but I knew Mom didn't have the spare money to send me on a two-hour trip to an opera.
 I was working now, but by the time I could save up enough to pay for gas, food, and a ticket, the production would've moved on.
 "I'm sorry, I'd like to go, but I just don't think I can.
 If it was running for an extra month or two I could probably save up enough money from tutoring, but it isn't, so it just isn't going to happen."
 Rachel nodded, and for a second it was easy to forget that she probably got more spending money each month than I'd see all year.
 "That's okay.
 Things like that are always coming through Vegas.
 We can just go the next time they come to town."
 I nodded and smiled, surprised that the thought of so much time trapped in a car with someone didn't make me want to run away screaming.
 Cars were scary.

“I must go.” “Wait!” I called.
 “Wait; tell me what's going on!
 Tell me what we're supposed to do!” But she was already gone.
 *** I opened my eyes and the cold of the morning bit at my cheeks.
 Seth was fast asleep next to me, his blue hair covering half his face.
 Emily was curled up a few feet away from me.
 Jason turned in his sleep, mumbling something unintelligent.
 I needed to talk to someone, but everyone was sleeping.
 I pushed Seth over and his eyes flew open.
 His hand went to his sword but he saw me and he relaxed.

I picked him up from work.
 We stopped at a hamburger drive-thru and at a liquor store where the proprietor had more avarice than scruples.
 On Point Loma, in Fort Rosecrans, Eric’s dad’s grave lies in a clearing with no shrubs or trees nearby to mark the spot yet, even in the dark, Eric walked right to it.
 He knelt beside it.
 A couple feet down from the headstone, he dug out a piece of sod, dropped a candy heart underneath it, and replaced the sod.
 We left the cemetery and parked just outside, and sat on the ground with our legs hanging over, about fifty feet above where the waves flooded the tide pools.
 Once before in this spot, Eric had mused that whenever he died, he wanted his ashes scattered from here, out toward the beach and sea.
 Several times, he placed a candy heart on his tongue, chewed slowly, and washed it down with the wine we had brought.
 “I’ve got to tell you,” he said.
 “The big change still hasn’t come, but it’s getting awfully close.” “Hey,” I argued, “you already got kicked out of school, you’re working full-time and don’t much hang out with friends anymore.

Will I meet my knight in shining armor?
 Johnny – I don’t have psychic powers.
 Jim – Then why did you tell us that you did?
 What a let-down.
 Johnny – I just meant that, I’d rather be hit by a speeding train than to talk to the king of idiots again.
 Liz – Why didn’t you just say that in more simple terms in the first place?
 No need to lead us on.
 We got all excited about knowing our future, and here you go and do that.
 Jim – Yeah, with a psychic to help us we could stave off the Canadian advance, you got my hopes up.
 Johnny – Ha Ha Ha.

Rachel draped my arm over her shoulders, and then dragged me forward a couple of awkward, hopping steps.
 A couple of heartbeats passed before I realized the pool of shadow before us was Jessica.
 She had her eyes closed and was rocking back and forth as Rachel carefully pulled her to us.
 I mirrored Rachel's actions, wrapping my free arm around Jess as I whipped my head back and forth in an effort to figure out what was going on.
 We were pressed up against one corner of the pavilion, with what I assumed was the rest of the pack between us and everyone else.
 For a moment the wall of bodies precluded figuring out what was going on, but then Isaac shifted slightly to the left, and I saw Brandon and Vincent through the gap.
 The pools of black where Vincent's eyes should have been finally made me aware of the prickle of energy arcing back and forth between the two rival groups.
 I couldn't imagine what it must feel like where Alec or Brandon were standing.
 Even just the fringe of power dancing over my arms and shoulders was enough to make me profoundly grateful I wasn't any closer to the epicenter.
 Vincent's sadistic smile sent shivers down my spine, but it was nothing compared to Brandon's expression.

I rolled to my side, rubbing the sleep from my face.
 There were a few books on the bedside table and I reached over to draw the top one near.
 I flipped idly through the pages, until I recognized it was detailing the different aspects of magic.
 I hurriedly scanned through, getting caught on a section marked Exchange.
 It claimed using magic consumed a person’s energy.
 Not just immediately available energy, but life energy.
 I’d never known a book to lie, but I couldn’t imagine its applications otherwise.
 Ruby was giving part of her existence to draw me a bath?
 Chevelle and Steed forfeited time for a silly instructional match?
 It couldn’t have been right.

Then, she looked up and her expression reminded Rodregas of some girl who had gotten the perfect mid winter gift that she had been dreaming of.
 “These are not books on magic,” she said.
 “These are Grimoires, several of them of great power.” “Really?” Rodregas said, “I was a squire who learned a little magic, but I really can’t say that I know the difference between a book of magic and a Grimoire.” Imeralda looked surprised and said, “Oh, you guys must depend on the oral tradition.
 That is a hard way to learn.
 The symbols and geometric figures that form a powerful spell are often too complex to learn from just the spoken word.” Rodregas cut in and clarified, “I mean, in the order we did read books on magic theory and history, but I never felt energy from them before.” Imeralda nodded, “Let me explain.
 First, you have a lot more power now, and power calls to power.
 So, you are a lot more sensitive to the power that the books have.
 But what separates Grimoires from other books is that they are made like the stone walls of these buildings, by Nymphs.
 It is thought that the original reason was simply to have books that would not rot over a period of centuries, but the nymph-created paper and leather can hold a faint imprint of magic.
 “Each time that the sorcerers cast a spell from the book, it lightly engraved the pattern into the paige.

she whispered hoarsely.
 "I can't do it.
 I can't do it!"
 She turned and ran to her room.
 Rick hurried after her.
 "I'm sorry!

 Her door was locked, so he knocked.
 "Marie?"
 When she didn't respond, he leaned against the door, sliding to the floor.

I heard a faint clang ahead.
 I walked faster and with ever step the noise got louder.
 When the ground became completely flat, I stopped at the scene in front of me.
 Seth spun around, bringing his sword up to block Kojas’ swords.
 Kojas pulled his swords back and slashed through the air.
 Seth ducked and stabbed at his opponents’ middle.
 Kojas brought his sword down and swiped Seth’s.
 It twisted out of Seth’s grip and fell to the ground.
 I wanted to scream, but I couldn’t.
 I was frozen in fear.

Then he rolled up the window, started the car, and droved away.
 I slept on Jill’s couch.
 In the morning I walked to a donut shop.
 It had a service window opening onto the sidewalk.
 A trio of boys about my age stood waiting their turn.
 But when they saw me, they jumped aside.
 That whole summer, I struck terror into many hearts on account of I had backed down two of Pacific Beach’s toughest.
 At parties and the beach, girls who got upset and spiteful toward their boyfriends would appear at my side in hopes the boyfriend would object and I would thrash him.
 At Carmen Ranch Club, Eric was on the trampoline, probably showing off for his friend Carol, when he soared too high and got distracted by something.
 He fell sideways, ricocheted off the rail and landed on asphalt.

“To be honest, I am surprised how many are left.
 There are still quite a few young fools out there.” “So how many are left now?” Rodregas asked.
 “Fifty-four, on my last count,” Doi’van said.
 Rodregas was a little worried about his shield and wondered if he should jump in and rescue it from the powerful grip of the Hellborn, but he held his tongue and let Doi’van handle the equipment.
 “I see you are employing the forces of the Infernal Realm to aid you in the joust,” said a voice behind Rodregas.
 Rodregas unfortunately recognized the voice as that of Ambassador Van’dret even before he turned and saw him standing there.
 Two nervous looking squires were standing behind him, one holding a glass and a bottle of wine.
 The tall graceful Immortalist had dark robes of deepest black with swirling gold patterns sewn on it.
 His hair was pulled back and to the side in an unusual looking style.
 “My Lord,” Rodregas responded.

 He screwed it into a lamp in the living room.

 "It's beautiful!"
 He laughed.
 "I'm going to go make dinner while you amuse yourself."
 "Don't use the microwave without me!"
 After dinner they spent the evening watching TV.

Rodregas took a chance before they got too close and glanced over at Doi’van.
 In one of those weird moments that happen in battle, he saw the path between them was open.
 He was also backing up, surrounded by three more foes.
 “At least they are all slavers.” Rodregas thought.
 Rodregas scooted back and said, “Back to back.” Doi’van gave a grunt of acknowledgement, and they faced in opposite directions.
 They were quickly surrounded.
 Another final Immortal Guard stepped into the circle, increasing the odds against them.
 Both had long swords and small shields and were dressed in the Mithril and Night Bronze half plate of the regular guard.
 The four slavers had mismatched armor; two had short swords and there was one each with an axe and a mace.
 The men circled them, but did not seem eager to move in.

And here we all thought you were doing so well you didn't need to bother with the test."
 I took the proffered test and made my unsteady way back to my desk.
 The class passed in a blur as I made a half-hearted attempt to focus on the questions and remember all kinds of facts about photosynthesis that I'd known just a few days before.
 It was useless.
 The separate pieces of information skittered about on the edge of my memory without ever becoming tangible enough to relate to the answer I needed.
 By the time class ended, I'd almost completely shut down.
 I registered the whispers as I made my way to English.
 I normally would've been mad, or possibly embarrassed, but it was like my feelings were wrapped in layers of cotton candy.
 If I really pushed, I could faintly feel the hard edges, but there were so many layers shrouding them.
 I just couldn't seem to muster up enough concentration to care.

Imeralda was stepping forward with the dagger to finish Van’dret, but he caught her arm and said, “Wait.
 Stop, let me.
 He should be as strong as I am.
 Let me and Doi’van get in close.” She hesitated, but nodded and handed her dagger to him.
 Doi’van pounded past the two and picked Van’dret off the ground, by the front of his robes, and gave him a backhanded slap across the face.
 It was with enough power to have snapped a normal man’s neck, but Van’dret looked more startled than hurt.
 “Gag him and don’t let him move his fingers,” said Imeralda.
 Even as Doi’van nodded he slapped his open palm against Van’dret’s mouth and used his other hand to grab one of the sorcerer’s free hands.
 Rodregas grabbed the other.
 “Put him on the ground and kneel on him,” Rodregas said to Doi’van.

I thought they would be made of stone like the frog,” said Imeralda.
 Rodregas nodded.
 The beasts looked to be made of flesh and bone, except they all stood perfectly still on short stone pedestals.
 Strangely, the room did not smell of damp stone like the rest of the cathedral, but the air smelled of the outdoors in spring.
 Rodregas’ eyes were drawn to the powerful lion that reared up not far into the gathered animals, and just to the right of the center.
 He walked over to it.
 It looked like it could have been the twin for the beast that had been devoured by the blue flame on top of Raven Keep.
 He stepped up close looking up at the beast; he was massive!
 The beast’s mouth was open, not as if he was going to roar, but simply in relaxed pose.
 He looked like he had been caught stalking forward on the hunt.

Release any remaining prisoners and make sure they are fed and clothed, and allow them to make their way back to their homes.” “That has some danger to it,” said Captain Poir hurriedly, his expression returning to a look of concern.
 “True,” he replied.
 “But do as I command,” Rodregas stated in his firmest voice.
 Captain Poir nodded and immediately said, “As you command, master.” Rodregas started to open the door to the stairway when another thought hit him, and he turned back to the captain, and said, “I need time to adjust.
 Make sure that I am not disturbed in my quarters tonight, but tell Adapt Korin that before he leaves to celebrate, to come up to my room for some last minute instructions.” Captain Poir responded with his very military, “Yes sir.”  Rodregas had to admit while most of the guards were no better trained than a ruffian off the street the captain had served with The Immortal Guards and he was highly trained and disciplined.
 Rodregas had always wondered what had brought a man of his obvious military background to serve Ravenhurr; thank goodness he clearly did not understand the simplest things about magic.
 On the other hand, the AElf maiden clearly had some ideas.
 He was glad she was gagged and not able to speak, and the guards knew better than to release a mage from her bindings until they had to.
 As Rodregas made his way down to the next level, the personal level of Master Ravenhurr, he closed the door to his suite of rooms that covered the whole floor.
 He listened as the other guards made their way down the tower.

And they were turning hoses on kids.
 Chicago happened, Abbie was arrested and tried.
 They tied a man to a chair—this was 1968, man, not 1868.
 I was aghast, the whole country was aghast, I mean, those who cared.
 It seemed the vultures had descended and taken over.
 They were picking the bones of America, licking their slathering jaws and, well, it all was just so bleak bleak bleak.
 When they shot the kids at Kent, I went into a tailspin.
 I wish I had Neil’s presence of mind—I mean, he picks up his guitar and writes, “Tin soldiers and Nixon coming,” man, and just put it all out there, naked, true.
 It was like Lennon blasting us with “Revolution.”  And, man, I was just so out of it, I was just so fucking passive.
 I was inert, man.

His silence was making her uncomfortable.
 "If you could just point me toward Meadows Street .

 He swallowed.
 “Do you know what year this is?” She frowned.
 “What year?” “Yes.
 You know, 1850, 1875, 1900 .

“Well I, just…” His face turned a mixture of gray and red.
 “Qurrah doesn’t know I’m doing this.”
 Aurelia sighed and set the book down beside her.
 “Why don’t you tell him about me?
 Well?
 Why not?”
 “I’m just embarrassed, all right,” he finally muttered.
 “Embarrassed?
 Why?”
 “Qurrah’s smart, can read and everything.

After we staggered through the aisles at the grocery store and delivered the bags to Evelyn, we drove up Mount Helix to the highest place in our town and paced around the big cross in the mountaintop park, staring all around at Mexico, the Pacific, and the Laguna Mountains.
 Every few minutes one of us would offer a reason why Eric couldn’t possibly die.
 He was the strongest person we knew.
 He was only seventeen.
 People needed him.
 We needed him.
 Around noon, I mentioned how stricken Mrs. Bole had looked.
 Billy suggested we ought to tell her that Eric hadn’t blamed her for expelling him.
 We parked out front of the school, climbed the steps, and had just turned the corner to the hall in front of the office building, when a girl ran out of the office sobbing hysterically.
 She might’ve known Eric, but not well.

Of course it was possible he'd forgotten to make the arrangements, but somehow I doubted it.
 Mom looked like she was starting to waver.
 "It does seem like a great opportunity, but there just isn't any good way to know for sure it's legitimate."
 That didn't sound like Alec at all.
 "Are you sure, Mom?
 They didn't arrange anything you could use to verify they're for real?"
 I suddenly realized why parents got such a big kick out of catching their kids doing something wrong.
 Mom looked so sheepish I almost laughed.
 "Well, he did say he'd arrange for an immediate advance to be wired over to our bank, but it's closed on Saturdays, and it isn't like I can go calling up the bank president for something trivial like that."
 I opened my mouth, still unsure what to say in response to her latest excuse, only to be interrupted by her cell phone again.

She looked like she was about to start crying any second.
 Seth drew his sword and crouched down.
 He shuffled forward and motioned for us to follow.
 We slid through the trees as quietly as we could.
 I kept my eye on the faery men, waiting for one of them to turn around and notice us hiding in the trees.
 I ducked behind a tree and looked over just in time to see Emily trip and fall out of her bush.
 The faery and dwarves looked at her in surprise.
 I guess they’ve never seen a teenage half-ling girl fall out of a bush before.
 “Am I interrupting something?” Emily asked with a gulp.
 The faery men drew their double swords and charged at her.

There weren't supposed to be any wolves in the area, but there wasn't any ignoring my ears.
 I numbly pulled myself back up, and began stumbling back towards the party, only to stop as another howl echoed down through the canyon.
 It was between me and everyone else.
 I turned and started into a shuffling run.
 Maybe the wolf would be attracted to the noise and light.
 Maybe I'd be able to get far enough away it wouldn't smell me.
 I'd only been moving for about a minute before another howl sent chills running down my spine.
 It sounded like a different wolf, and it was closer than the first one.
 I tried to run faster, but all that time studiously avoiding exercise was working against me.
 I topped a slight rise and then tripped as the ground wasn't where I expected it to be.

“Got to be a disguise,” he said.
 Another guard used the hilt of his sword to strike Harruq’s back.
 The blow blasted the air out of his lungs.
 The leader of the guards tugged all along Harruq’s face, pulling hair and scratching skin.
 “I’ll be,” he said.
 “It is real.
 No illusion and no disguise.
 You two cretins have god-damned elf blood in you.”
 “You jest,” Qurrah said, hanging back and showing no sign of aggression.
 The soldiers clearly thought Harruq the more dangerous of the two, and he was more than willing to let them continue thinking that.

Aurelia cast a spell over her ears, heightening her already sharp hearing.
 A pall settled over her as she listened.
 “…‌must resume,” Qurrah was saying as her spell enacted.
 “It’s dangerous,” Harruq said.
 “I thought you were learning enough from Velixar.”
 “Exactly,” said Qurrah.
 “But I must practice what I learn.
 These nights are not enough, will never be enough.
 What point is sharpening your sword if you never wield it?”
 Harruq had no reply.

The fact I was saying these things to Alec when I knew this all had to be a dream was ludicrous, but it wasn't as ludicrous as the way he flinched at my words.
 "No, you're right, all too soon you'll go the way of so many others.
 If I can depend on nothing else, I can rely on that."
 A little eddy of wind found its way into our grotto, and for the first time my newly-acute sense of smell registered Alec's presence.
 His scent was divine, full of subtle themes I wasn't experienced enough to pick out, all of which screamed of warm power and rock-like masculinity.
 For half a second the torrent of sensation was too strong to leave room for conscious thought.
 I realized I'd closed my eyes to better savor the experience.
 When I opened them Alec's expression had moved from annoyance to sadness.
 I had a pair of heartbeats to wonder at the strange tricks my subconscious was playing on me, and then the dream started fading away.
 The heavenly surroundings were predictably the first thing to disappear, leaving afterimages of light burned into the corners of my vision.

This was the same radio from which I would later hear about deaths: Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Martin Luther King.
 Shit, I still have that little radio—I kept it because it seemed important.
 (laughs) It was my mother’s kitchen radio—it’s still around here somewhere.
 And, on this particular morning of oatmeal and familial familiarities, a song emanated from that plastic box, bellowing something about a “black branch with blood that kept dripping.” You know?
 And, “a white ladder all covered with water.”  I thought, holy hell.
 Of course, by this time, I was making my own music, fixing to go out on my own, and, in a way, I saw Dylan as a map, as a way out into the world.
 What more can we ask of art, right?
 Later, when I met him, I talked to him about this and he was, well, flattered, I guess, and he talked about how Guthrie and Leadbelly were like that for him.
 All these memories collide in my head to form a capharnaum around what I want to know more concretely: how did Bob Dylan become important to me?
 And the process must have been gradual, an accretion, Bob Dylan never became, for me, what James Joyce was for Richard Ellmann, or to use a less pretentious comparison, what hamburgers were for Wimpy.

As this evolutionary process unfolds, each element of human personality -- physical skill, vital relationship, mental understanding, spiritual values – is enhanced in a progression without end, bringing with it greater material fruits, richer life experience, and higher knowledge.
 The unfolding and flowering of the human being is at once the source and the goal of development.
 Thus, in all our efforts to elevate human society, our primary endeavour must be to enhance these human endowments and expand individual freedom of self-expression.
 Peace, democracy, employment opportunities, food security, education, training, access to information, cooperation, freedom of action and a spirit of innovation are the essential conditions and means for this process to advance.
 There was a time when humanity’s progress was primarily the result of the collective efforts of the community, demanding and obtaining the strict obedience and conformity of its individual members to preserve what it had created and further the progress of the collective.
 That point is now past.
 In the century now commencing, the individual human being must come into his own as a free and creative force.
 The groundwork has been prepared by the spread of democracy, human rights, universal education, gender and social equality and, more recently, information empowerment.
 The power of individual awakening is responsible for the revolution of rising expectations that has fuelled unprecedented rates of growth and social transformation during the past half century.
 That same power can be seen among the talented youth of developing countries today, who are awakened to the prospects of a better life and aspiring for higher accomplishment, either at home or in ever increasing numbers abroad.

And his obsession with marriage increased tenfold.
 I had not met his family, but one morning when I arrived at the patch of forest where we met, he proudly presented his mother’s wedding gown, a gift for me.
 He wanted me to wear it in our ceremony.
 I had never agreed to the union, but I avoided telling him it was not possible.
 It would be only valid in his mind.
 But then again, what would that hurt?
 I accepted the dress from him, looking it over.
 It was poorly made and ill-fitting, but had potential as a design.
 I sat, using magic to work on the seaming and arrange the pearl strands and beading in a more pleasant pattern while deciding how best to deal with him.
 He was watching me intently.

Coming here was the best idea we've ever had."
 Normally Mom's enthusiasm was fairly catching.
 You expect that kind of energy in a child; when it comes from an adult it's hard not to react in kind.
 It didn't manage to infect me this time, but it did help focus me on the here and now.
 I figured I owed her for that, so I tried to suppress my generally ungracious nature.
 I even let her lead me up the creaky stairs to show me the 'amazing view' for the third time.
 Mom pulled the mirrors out of my hands as soon as I reached the larger bedroom, and nudged me towards the window.
 "Admit it, Adri, we didn't get sunsets like this very often in Minnesota."
 "Adriana," I corrected automatically, trying to avoid thinking about where my nickname had come from.
 The sunset was beautiful, just starting to turn the sky pink as a prelude to the glorious oranges that would no doubt follow.

 She looked doubtful.
 "Sweetie, I know it seems exciting, and heaven knows we could use the money, but that just isn't my kind of thing."
 I shrugged.
 "Yeah, but once you've had some paying photography jobs it's sure to help land others.
 It isn't your ideal kind of work, but it's still a good start, and you never know where it might lead."
 "I can't leave you here alone.
 Not only that, I've still got the brochure to do."
 Obviously I was going to have to work harder.
 "Mom, I'll be fine.

The pain that exploded throughout his body was so great he blacked out as he lay there in the grass, a horde of undead searching for his wounded form.

 As Dieredon fought for his life, Harruq and Qurrah snuck through the streets of Woodhaven.
 They avoided the light of lamps at all costs and stopped only a moment so Harruq could don his new armor.
 They had to be careful, for if any saw the two half-orcs traveling amid the dark their lives would be forfeit.
 When they neared Celed, Qurrah halted.
 He stared down a particular street for a long while before closing his eyes.
 Harruq waited in silence.
 “That is the way,” Qurrah said.

“What is it that I saw?” he asked.
 “The second time I ever killed,” Qurrah said.
 “I watched that wretched bully succumb to madness from the disease carried by an undead rat.
 He took something I made for my brother, and I made him pay dearly for it.”
 The man in black nodded, going over the memory in his mind.
 “Could be darker, though,” he said.
 “You need not use memories, but they are easier to project.
 Any thought can be sent to those who slumber.
 After you have practiced, we will try with images you created on your own.”
 The half-orc pulled his robes around him and looked back to the city.

Brandon's energy beat down on Alec, beat down on all of us, but although I could feel the answering flare of power from the rest of the pack, Alec remained silent, dancing away from the worst bursts of metaphorical death at the same time he dodged Brandon's fangs.
 The flares were almost dead, but there was just enough light for me to see the smaller figure reel away from the larger as a vicious slash sank home in Alec's chest.
 Time stretched and pulled like taffy, and I had plenty of time to watch Alec fall, to feel splatters of hot liquid even standing so far away.
 A scream ripped itself free from my throat, and it suddenly seemed we really were caught up in a hurricane.
 As the flares finally died, the pulsing pressure, the pins and needles disappeared as well.
 Only that wasn't quite the term for it.
 The power, the energy that'd become more than oppressive, was sucked towards Alec and Brandon, dragging with it my strength, and the unnatural vitality of the rest of the pack.
 I felt a lance of pain sink into my back, mirroring the jolt in my ankle, as all five shape shifters collapsed around me.
 I knew with a certainty I was going to die, that we were all going to die, but that didn't matter.
 It was only right that my existence cease within heartbeats of Alec's.

He stepped away from the wall.
 It was time to get to work.
 CHAPTER 3 THE RAVEN TOWER
 Rodregas stepped into the master’s bedroom for the first time in his twenty years of service in Raven Tower.
 He was unarmed; unarmored and needed to get as far away from Raven Keep as he could before someone noticed that he was not a sorcerer.
 He had spent too much time on the road without money, and he was not going to repeat the experience if he could help it.
 He needed money.
 Money would buy him what he needed to start his new life.
 Unfortunately, Ravenhurr had not been interested in material wealth, and what money he did have, he tended to spend on materials needed for his magical ceremonies; still there should be something that he could use.
 The bedroom was not large but this floor also held Ravenhurr’s study and a water closet.

 In a way.
 That’s when I got kind of a big head and dreamt of things beyond.
 I certainly had left Central High School, left my friends, my girlfriends.
 Even before we cut the album.

He raised her knuckles to his lips.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart—I never considered that living here with me might make you uncomfortable."
 "It doesn't.
 I feel as safe with you as I do in my own home.
 I just--it's just that no one else would understand."
 "Well, don't worry about Teri.
 I won't tell her, and she's going to love you."
 They went into the kitchen to fix breakfast.
 Marie glanced at Rick as he poured juice.
 When he noticed her glance, she dropped her eyes to the bread she was buttering.

Squonks cry themselves to death, dissolve in their own tears.
 That’s what I mean by the ironic twists to I Was A Child.
 This charge of self-pity, yeah, man, I’m on it, I dig.
 It’s right there on the album, if you really listened to it, if you listened with more than your ears, man.
 The repetition of “I’m crying”—almost three minutes of it, I know—it goes back to “I’m Gonna Sit Right Down and Cry Over You” and Lennon’s “I Want You.”  You know, you strip it down, you get right to the core phrase, the essential thing you wanna say—that’s what I’m getting at.
 I’m crying, yeah.

“Is it true, did you take on a monster by yourself yesterday?” I sighed, shooting a look at Seth.
 “Yes it is.
 Thanks tattle-tale Seth.” “Well you did and I thought the group had a right to know that.” Seth said sharply.
 “How could you Jazell?
 You could have gotten seriously hurt.
 Plus I bet all of us want a shot at them too.” She huffed and shook her head.
 The light brown curls that framed her pretty face bounced around playfully.
 “I’m fine Emily, seriously.” Jason was silent.
 He never talked much like Emily, who was easily the most talkative, friendly person I knew.
 Jason was more of the silent, watching type, who said little but noticed much.

"So this isn't normal?"
 Dom shook her head again.
 "No, in most packs, any confrontation ends in violence.
 Generally there are a whole host of dominants who want to become the alpha.
 This would usually turn into a real dominance fight, with the other two doing their very best to kill him before turning on each other to fight over the spoils."
 "That's terrible."
 Her nod was sad.
 "I told you he was special.
 All of that hard-won civilization tends to flake and chip away when we're that close to our beast.
 Alec always does what's right though.

"I don't think Alec exactly got me into all of this.
 It was more like my own stupidity that landed me in this particular batch of trouble."
 "Please, as if any girl who didn't know what a jerk Brandon was would've done anything different.
 He's gorgeous.
 It isn't until you realize just how hollow he is that anyone has a chance of resisting him."
 There wasn't really any response to that.
 "So, what's going to happen now?
 I mean with Brandon's pack?
 Everyone seemed really worried last night."
 "I'm not sure.

Harruq used only one sword, running it in slow circles, stabs, and the occasional feint.
 He enjoyed the steady workout but savored even more watching Aurelia move gracefully through the air.
 Whenever his eyes lingered too long, however, he’d feel the sharp sting of Aurelia’s staff against his arms or chest.
 When they finished, Harruq slumped onto his rear and rubbed his bruises.
 “I shouldn’t be able to hit you,” Aurelia said as she sat across from him, her legs tucked underneath her.
 “Yeah, so?” Harruq asked.
 “So tomorrow don’t let me hit you,” she said.
 The half-orc mumbled and rolled his eyes.
 Aurelia leaned back against a tree, her eyes studying him.
 Her look gave him shivers, both good and bad.

"No, I'd already have come and carried you away if any of Brandon's people were around.
 Barring that, you'd hear us fighting.
 Mere doors and windows wouldn't do much to muffle the sound."
 "You'd be fighting, because of me."
 Alec slowly crossed the distance between us, and took my shoulders in his hands.
 "Please don't try and take the blame for this.
 We've been on a collision course with Brandon's pack for years."
 His touch was intoxicating.
 I could feel warm tingles start from my shoulders and work their way down my arms.
 A full two seconds of silence passed before I realized he'd asked me why I'd come downstairs.

I had lost a couple of close friends to drug overdoses and a couple I knew were in prison.
 My own older brother had been sent to prison for drug dealing and although he had long been free from incarceration, he will never be free from his issues surrounding addiction.
 My biological father is an alcoholic, refusing to acknowledge his addiction and destroying any chance of being part of my youth or my children’s (his grandchildren’s) lives.
 Watching drugs tear apart my family and kill my friends had sent me in the opposite direction as an adult, as a husband and as a father.
 Soon Lisa and I couldn’t ignore Brandon’s behavior.
 Hoping it would just go away or that he would grow out of it like I did didn’t seem likely.
 His grades were terrible, and he kept getting in trouble for being in the wrong place at the wrong time or with the wrong person.
 For instance, he was put on probation for being in a car with someone who was in possession of a replica firearm.
 He looked like total shit, and when we confronted him about it he was feeling bad enough that he confessed: He was addicted to the pain pill known as Oxy.
 He told us that he needed our help to get off of it.

“The pouch from the vault.
 There was a stone in it.” It was clear he was asking for the ruby, but I wasn’t sure why.
 I didn’t think I had much choice in the matter, given that I was a criminal, but could come up with no real reason to fight it.
 Standing in the center of this strange room, in the middle of a mountain, had me thinking through fog.
 I was going to be returned to the village for punishment—or worse, now that I was being tracked by Grand Council.
 I was completely ignorant of where I was.
 I had apparently lost part of my memories and magic because I had been bound, was still bound.
 I realized Chevelle was watching me, waiting for the stone.
 Shaking free of the thoughts, I removed the pouch from my pack to untie the lacing.
 I reached inside, wondering momentarily what else might be written in the ancient language on the scroll.

Five?
 “I cannot be so weak,” he muttered to himself.
 Footsteps echoed from the first floor.
 One person, he guessed, most likely an elf judging by the design of the building.
 Qurrah stood and readied his whip.
 He would not cower in hiding.
 This was his home now.
 He would defend it.
 “You are not safe here,” Qurrah whispered.
 “For if you are safe, then I am not.”

He gazed down into those huge, shimmering hazel eyes and felt his heart melt.
 "It'll be all right, sweetheart."
 He sat down on the edge of the bed and drew her into his arms.
 "We'll get you back home.
 And until we do, I'll take care of you.
 I promise."
 She drew comfort from his embrace for a few minutes.
 Then she drew back, trying to smile.
 "Why are you so kind?"
 "A pretty girl from 1927 wandered into my garden.

You get where I am going with this.
 I always found it ignorant when someone would advise me how to raise my child when they had no children at all or they had children younger than mine.
 The most absurd statements begin with the words “my children will never."
 I never offered advice to any parent, and I never welcomed a statement about raising my children that began with the words “you should.” I have always tried to be the best dad I could be, because it was up to me to make their upbringing different than mine.
 I coached their soccer, baseball and football teams for many seasons.
 I walked my boys to school, helped with their homework (as much as I could) and I tried to be an important part of their lives as well as a positive influence.
 As I continued to succeed in business, our lifestyle improved.
 Throughout their childhoods, we’ve had a good life and a beautiful home, nice cars, good communities, and the best of schools.
 I encouraged their interests by making sure they had the equipment they needed to pursue them.
 For instance, when Brandon showed a real interest in and talent for photography, he received his dream camera for Christmas.

I'd spent too much time with emotions and thoughts floating around in my own head that I didn't want examined too closely.
 I wasn't about to pry if there was something she didn't want to tell me.
 "I guess that's fair.
 Let me know if you have any more questions."
 Rachel nodded, and then turned back to her book, apparently having used up her store of courage for the afternoon.
 I stopped by Britney's desk to ask if she needed any help, and had to avoid an attempt to suck me into another gripe session about Mrs. Campbell.
 Satisfied that there wasn't anything I needed to be doing to help either of the other girls, and that they'd let me know if that changed, I broke out my Spanish book and reviewed some more vocabulary.
 Despite my growing hatred for Mrs. Tiggs, I managed to get deep enough into my Spanish homework to lose track of time.
 When I finally surfaced from abeja, camisa, and reloj it was just five minutes before I was supposed to close up for the afternoon.
 Rachel pulled her things together and left while I was straightening up the chairs.

On breaks from the story, he returned to his winnowing.
 He loaded a garbage can with old board games and school papers and gave a couple of pairs of jeans to a neighbor boy.
 He even tossed out the charred and bent pan he used to make popcorn since he had grown tall enough to reach the stovetop.
 That evening, when I called to ask if he wanted to go to the cut-rate movies or shoot pool with Billy and me, he was probably home.
 But Sylvia had gone out with Richard, and nobody answered the phone.
 Billy spent the night at my place.
 We had plans for the next day.
 Billy and I, Eric, and Kenny were going to drive up the coast to Laguna Beach, for the annual sidewalk art festival.
 Billy, like his brother Cliff, had a gift for drawing.
 On Sunday morning about nine, I phoned Kenny to tell him Billy was at my house and ask when he meant to pick us up.

“Oh boy, what did the two start?” I asked Seth.
 “This is going to go on and on and on and on...” “I get it,” he interrupted me.
 “This is never going to end.
 We'll be up all night.” “Unless you interrupt them and tell them about your secret,” I said.
 Seth looked down.
 “You want them to kill me?
 Maybe I'll tell them in the morning when they aren't so crabby.” “You better,” I snapped and stared at Emily and Jason.
 They were still bickering.
 I felt something on my hand and I looked down.
 Seth had wound his fingers in mine.

The attempt to move me is a tactic the narcotics’ officers know well.
 The goal of the drug dealer will be to get me on his ground and on his terms.
 With so many officers surrounding me in a variety of cars, trucks, vans and on foot around the parking lot acting like patrons of the nearby stores, there is no way they could all uproot and follow me to some new location.
 Not to mention that marked police cars are waiting within striking distance of the retail center.
 I know the cops can hear everything I say so I spare them my nervous singing and limit my comments, fighting my compulsion to curse wickedly at them.
 I’m staring off across the wetlands, connecting with known drug dealers, talking to undercover narcotics officers on my personal cell phone, feeling a wire taped to my body and extending up to my neck, holding a bottle filled with one hundred Oxys in my jacket pocket.
 What brought me here?
 Where did things get so completely fucked up?
 Chapter 8: Boy Meets World I officially moved out of my parents’ home when I was 15 years old, 35 years ago.
 I didn’t have a driver’s license yet, but I had a learner’s permit.

She wished that she could let them know that she was all right.
 And that someone was taking care of her.
 She'd only known Rick a week, but she already trusted him.
 More than she trusted Davis.
 Rick had kept his promise and come home at 5:30 every day, and he'd apologized for trying to kiss her.
 The last time she'd seen Davis, he'd kissed her so hard that her teeth had cut her lips.
 And he certainly hadn't apologized.
 She touched the ring that Davis had put on her left hand, twisting it.
 Could she spend her entire life with a man like that?

The adoption of new technologies even in traditional occupations has resulted in a growing demand for higher skill levels in these fields as well.
 Unemployment is highest among the least educated, least skilled categories, such as machine operators, fabricators and labourers.
 The poor are poor both because they have no assets and because their time and labour have low or no economic value.
 Poverty persists wherever the human resource is under-valued.
 To eradicate it, there is need for a paradigm shift from unskilled to skilled work.
 While educated unemployment is high in many developing countries, in most cases the quality and relevance of the education to employment opportunities is far from adequate.
 Here too, fully qualified technical and professional workers are in short supply.
 There is even a shortage for educated workers with a high level of general language and communication skills to fill the job opportunities being created for business process outsourcing.
 On an average, 50 per cent of firms surveyed in a cross-section of developing countries report that skill shortages are a serious constraint on their growth.
 Firms that adopt new technologies report even more serious problems.

"Yes."
 But her face fell.
 "To be honest, I don't know how.
 We have a cook.
 But I'd like to try."
 "OK.
 I'll supervise until we're sure you're not going to chop off your fingers or anything."
 He smiled, taking her hand and squeezing it.
 "But it's such a beautiful day.

See you around.” She grabbed my hand and pulled me away.
 Seth turned to see me leave and the look gave me a dark feeling inside.
 His face was masked with one emotion, one that made me vow to myself that I would find out what he was hiding, what he was keeping a secret.
 That emotion was not Seth, not the one I knew.
 It made me feel the same way and I didn’t know why.
 Fear.

 We attacked them with a pool, and they threw water balloons at us while we were on bikes.

Is your mother home?"
 Suddenly struck by the fact that living in the country meant there wasn't anyone around to hear your screams, I almost lied, but for whatever reason I believed him.
 Maybe because he exuded the false, overabundant sincerity I'd come to associate with both the class presidents I'd known back in Minnesota.
 "She's out photographing one of the parks.
 Is there a message you'd like me to pass on?"
 He looked surprisingly uncertain, almost like he was used to working from a script, and didn't know what to do when things didn't go as planned.
 "Do you know when she'll be back?"
 My headshake seemed to unnerve him a little more.
 Presumably he was having a hard time believing in a world where people didn't have fixed schedules, where moms didn't let their daughters know when they'd be back from their outings.
 "The message really is quite urgent.

They asked Brandon to sit back down on the overstuffed chair and he did.
 “He won’t find anything in there,” Brandon mumbled.
 A few minutes later, Bryce rounded the corner into the room with his arms outstretched cupping the Oxy and foil he found inside CD cases.
 I had never even thought to check there.
 Brandon stood up.
 Bryce glared into Brandon’s eyes, and in the room’s dead silence Bryce laid the drugs and the burned black-sketched foil on the counter like it was a dead animal.
 I stood in front of Brandon, looking slightly up at him, as he is taller than me.
 The room was silent and everyone awestruck.
 After what we just went through with him… I looked Brandon in his guilty darkened eyes and I said, “Prepare yourself to find out what will happen to you every time you lie to me… are you ready?” Before he could reply or even contemplate my words, I felt the crack of Brandon’s nose on my knuckles and he flew backwards off his feet.
 My family’s loud simultaneous gasps accompanied Harry and Bryce’s rush to restrain me as if I was going to continue the beating.

I don’t know what will happen.
 I heard a noise in the front room and slid the book under a pillow, dropped my head, and pretended to sleep.
 I’d been so absorbed in the book I had no idea how long I’d been reading.
 There was a light rap on my door.
 I tried to sound sleepy.
 “Yes?” “Frey, I’m on my way to the ridge.
 We will be leaving in the morning.” Ruby’s words confused me.
 I must have read through the night.
 “Okay.” “Steed is here.
 You can stay with him or go with me.” “I’ll stay.” I listened to her footsteps recede.

I still couldn't read it, but it was new and somehow seemed like it belonged there more than his normal impenetrable mask.
 "What's going on?
 Is she okay?"
 The sub had finally pushed his way through the crowd, and looked like he was about two steps away from a total panic.
 Alec stood, and it wasn't until I went up at the same time that I realized he was carrying me.
 "I think she'll be fine, but maybe I should get her to the nurse.
 Just to be sure."
 Even as he was talking, Alec was moving towards the door.
 "There's really no need.

She dropped her bag next to mine and leaned against the statue.
 Nobody spoke for awhile.
 Finally Emily opened her mouth and said, “What are you thinking about?” “What?” The question had caught me by complete surprise.
 “What are you thinking about?” she repeated.
 “Surely you must be thinking something; we’re going to some ‘other world’!” I closed my eyes.
 “I was just wondering what it would be like in Igneeria.
 What about you?” “Well,” she said thoughtfully, “I was thinking about Kojas-” “Emily don’t say his name, I don’t feel like being yelled at again.” I interrupted her.
 “Fine,” she said, a little annoyed.
 “I was thinking about him, if I must call him that, and what he’s like.” I rolled my eyes.
 “Emily isn’t it obvious; he’s evil for crying out loud.

We rode with a cabby to three motels.
 After the first, Eric said, “This is bad, Ken.
 I hate this.” At the second motel, he gave the girl half his money, for nothing.
 We were leaving the third place when he asked me, “Why do you do this?” "Excitement?"
 I guessed.
 Mike was sitting behind the driver’s seat.
 While the cabbie waited for an opening into the boulevard traffic, Mike leaned up close and growled, “It’s a good thing you don’t plan to get us roughed up, or else I’d have to pinch your head off.” The cabby muttered something in Spanish and made a face that seemed to say, “Go ahead, what do I care?” At an historic saloon called The Long Bar, Eric told me about all three prostitutes he’d talked to, where they came from, how large their families were, and he remembered most of their entire formal names.
 He spoke as if they had met at a box social.
 And he kept asking, “What can we do?” As if our mission was to fix all the world’s broken people.
 Eric was the fastest middle-distance runner in our school.

When it's all you can do to get through the day yourself, it's impossible to be a pillar of strength for someone else.
 History was a complete waste of time.
 I hadn't even made it through the reading assignment, and I still got a perfect score on the pop quiz.
 Physics was surprisingly full.
 Apparently Alec was the only hard-core party animal in the class.
 I was still feeling weird from Britney's story, so unlike the rest of my classmates, who seemed genuinely intrigued by the assignment, I just pretended to leaf through a reference book all hour.
 Spanish was as bad as history.
 Mrs. Tiggs turned on one of the Spanish TV channels within thirty seconds of class starting.
 Towards the end of the hour I finally started to come back out of my funk, so I put the last few minutes to good use reviewing vocabulary for the quiz on Tuesday.
 I felt a momentary surge of relief when class ended, but the feeling evaporated when I remembered I had to go to math tutoring.

 Eugene – I didn’t get beaten up.
 Liz – Did they chase you off then?
 Eugene – They didn’t chase me off either.
 Jim – They didn’t beat you up, or chase you off.
 I’m confused, it’s usually either one or the other.
 Eugene – They laughed.
 Liz – What did you do that was so funny?
 Eugene – I just walked onto the bus and said ‘Boku no namae wa Godzilla desu’, ‘My name is Godzilla’.

I will try to never question the order of my master or the will of my brother.”
 Velixar nodded although he appeared not to listen.
 Instead, his eyes burrowed into Harruq’s, prying information not from his mouth but from his very soul.
 “Tell me, Harruq, why do you mourn the lives of those you kill?”
 “I don’t,” Harruq said.
 He wasn’t sure if it was lie or truth, most likely a lie.
 “War is brutal.
 Life is brutal.” Velixar put a cold hand against Harruq’s face.

“Rise, Harruq Tun,” Velixar said.
 “Revel in the power of Karak.”
 “By the gods, brother, if you could see yourself,” Qurrah said, his voice full of shock and wonder.
 “Just one god, Qurrah,” Velixar corrected.
 “All this by the hand of one.
 I am that hand.”
 Harruq stood and looked down.
 His arms and legs bulged with muscle.
 He flexed his arm and stared at the growth that traveled all the way up to his neck.
 He felt within himself a lifewell of energy, one infinitely deep.

Unlike the house cats that he was familiar with, Rodregas could see a kind of intelligence in their eyes.
 He had the feeling they both knew to be careful with a fragile mortal, and they thought it was funny that he was so worried.
 This scene repeated itself almost every night, and several times the cats also brought game they had killed into the farmyard.
 Rodregas made a point of always taking a piece of the kill, as for some reason he felt this was expected as part of their adopted group.
 Plus, it added fresh meat to their diet without the three having to go hunting.
 After awhile he started to take the presence of the Dire Cats for granted and stopped worrying about the danger.
 Several weeks later, came the first night where neither the cats nor Doi’van were in the room.
 Doi’van was out messing with the well, Imeralda was reading one of the magic Grimoires by the fireplace.
 Rodregas was supposed to be reading as well, but had lost his focus on the complex diagram and was just looking at Imeralda.
 She was so beautiful, slim yet curvy.

CM:  	We’re nearing the end here.
 Anything else to add?
 BG:  	I’ll drop a bombshell on you, Creole.
 Only you will know this until you print it, dig?
 CM: 	Alright.
 BG:  	You know, I got a lot of big plans.
 I’ve got the LP of covers coming out.
 I got the novel, though that’s hush-hush.
 I’m working on some new material for a song-cycle LP, to be called The Agoraphobe’s Pandiculations.
 I might be scoring a movie for Robert Altman.

This allowed him to take advantage of his unnatural strength to overwhelm his foes.
 According to the contest rules, he could replace his shield after every fourth match if need be.
 By the final match, he was on his third and final shield.
 Most of the rest of the matches were with squires with no ribbons.
 But as the afternoon wrapped up his final match was against Karun who had two second place white ribbons on her arm.
 Rodregas was pretty sure this match would decide who got the yellow first place ribbon and who would get the white.
 If Rodregas won it would give him ten total points after three competitions.
 It would give Karun twelve points if she once more came in second.
 If he lost, it would be much harder.
 Karun would have thirteen and he would have nine points.

She asked me to sit on the grass for a minute.
 Staring across the ball fields, she said, “Just last week he promised that for my birthday he was going to give me a very special present, only I wouldn’t understand it for a long, long time.
 So he goes and gets killed on my birthday.
 What’s that mean?” I shrugged.
 We hugged stiffly.
 Then we parted and went our own ways.
 A few minutes later, I stumbled into my mom’s classroom at La Mesa Junior High School, while Billy and Cliff waited in my car.
 My mom was lecturing about prepositions.
 After a minute, she issued a reading assignment, followed me to a patio behind her room, and collapsed onto the picnic bench when I told her Eric was dead.
 “Oh God,” she moaned.

He took a sip of tea.
 "No one's ever served me breakfast in bed before."
 "Really?"
 She smiled.
 "I'm glad I'm the first."
 He glanced at her left hand.
 She'd taken off her engagement ring yesterday before they'd left for the shore, and she hadn't put it back on last night.
 She wasn't wearing it this morning, either.
 He wondered if she realized it but decided not to ask her.
 Setting his cup down, he said, "How would you like another new experience?"

I read the entries for hours.
 Ruby must have thought I was sleeping.
 I had no idea what in this journal could be of interest to Chevelle unless he knew the woman, and that kept me reading.
 It continued on—her father’s rigorous schedule, their distaste for her sister—and then the entries got more detailed and frequent.
 Mother has been too ill lately for guests.
 I have not been able to see her.
 The tedium of my duties is getting to me and Father has been relentless with my studies, pushing me harder and harder to strengthen my control.
 My sister has been exploring the mountains.
 I see her bring in all sorts of interesting finds, but she refuses to tell me where she got them.
 I wish there were a way to sneak out.

If even an inessential element or condition is missing, the process of transition may take much longer than would otherwise be necessary.
 Lack of information, lack of education, lack of necessary skills, lack of supportive laws or incentives or protection against losses – insufficiency in any of these areas may be enough to slow or delay the process of change by years or even decades.
 The world needs a coherent intellectual framework for understanding and dealing with radical transitions.
 High priority should be given to developing a fresh conceptual approach that is not en cumbered by allegiance to existing theories and systems.
 Transitions should be regarded as social transformations which depend on and result in corresponding changes in the political, economic and other spheres.
 Efforts to guide a multi-dimensional social transition through uni-dimensional strategies, particularly those limited to manipulation of macro-economic policy, are unlikely to yield the anticipated results.
 Even those transitions which are apparently confined to economic activities within a stable political context necessarily depend on changes in social attitudes and in social institutions which can be dealt with most effectively by assuming a wider perspective of the process.
 Clear visualization of the before and after states of transition, the existing system, the goals to be sought after, and a detailed picture of the changes that need to occur in behaviour, attitudes and institutions are necessary for deriving the most effective transition strategies.
 With the knowledge the world possesses today, with the example of many successful nations over the last four decades, and with its highly educated and motivated people, surely the nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia can abridge the time required and the hardship of lessons learned by trial and error to a few years.
 But this cannot be accomplished by sweeping remedies or hastened by over-eagerness or impatience.

 your kisses make me and ask her about-about making love.
 But there's no point to it!
 I won't have you any more!"
 She took the handkerchief he'd just pulled from his pocket, wiping her face.
 "It's so horrible.
 If-if I were to keep this beautiful ring, the first thing I'd want to do would be to run to my mother and tell her all about it.
 But I can't go to her.
 And when I can finally run to her, I won't be wearing this ring."
 Slowly she removed the ring from her finger.

After a last check for Dire Cats in front of the keep he headed out and away from both Raven Keep and Raven Town and away from his old life.
 CHAPTER 4 A FRESH START OR AN OLD PROBLEM
 Raven Keep, unlike many fortifications, was not located on a high spot.
 In fact, it was perched half way down a gentle valley.
 Farther down the valley, only a few minutes’ ride away was Raven Town.
 Even the kindest of folk would admit the town was not much more than an inn, a stable, the homes of the people that supported the local farming community, and of course, Raven Keep.
 Many of the keep employees and their family members lived in Raven Town.
 Luckily for Rodregas, there was a turn off almost immediately that let him circle around the edge of town and then start heading out of the valley.
 He went north toward the town of Cruet.
 As dusk was falling there was little traffic.

I followed without a word, even more intrigued now.
 'Cool' people don't sweat tardiness and Britney really wanted to be cool.
 A slender, frumpy-looking woman looked up from her desk as Britney and I walked in.
 I held up my form, which she took without reading it.
 "No doubt something to ensure I know you're my newest student.
 Sit over there where you won't distract Britney from just how poorly she's doing in my class.
 There's an extra book on the shelves in the back."
 Britney rolled her eyes as she went to her assigned desk, but I suspected she was actually relieved we'd been split up.
 Mrs. Campbell didn't seem like the kind of teacher you could get away with ignoring, so I retrieved an algebra book from the back of the room and sat at my desk.
 Any thoughts about finding out why hiking was off limits quickly melted away once class started.

Somehow it can be reached from here I think is the best way to describe it.
 But there is no sigil to be had.
 The tree ‘spoke’ to me as trees do, and it explained about the ‘Blessing of the One Tree,’ that is probably why it was here like the greater sigils.” Imeralda spoke in a conversational tone but also like she was amazed by her own story.
 She continued, “I think for a Nymph the Blessing of the One Tree is like a sigil.
 It directs your magic and focuses it as the Tree of Life wants it, but not by binding it into a shape.
 It heals your spirit and makes you more…, well, more of a Nymph,” she said, her voice was a tone of sunlight and happiness.
 For reasons Rodregas did not understand he felt great.
 “So, why do you have to climb up a hundred feet to the end of a branch to get a blessing from a tree?” Imeralda laughed and then yelled down to Doi’van, “Take your boots off and your harness and your weapons and climb up on the top of one of the big roots.
 That should work, you have to be on the One Tree and then I will show you the blessing.” Doi’van looked like he wanted to argue but with Rodregas’ nod of encouragement he followed her request, and Imeralda stepped closer and she held three golden fruits.
 The fruits looked like giant acorns, but rounder and softer.

I will check on Imeralda,” Doi’van nodded his thanks and sank down on the floor.
 Doi’van seemed to need to think more than rest, but either way Rodregas made sure he was ok and then went to check on Imeralda.
 He hoped she had not touched the One Tree.
 As he approached where Imeralda had shown them the door he was dismayed to see only black stone.
 “Damn,” he said quietly.
 He went to the middle where the door had been and was relieved when he was able to step through the invisible but open doorway.
 He felt nothing as he stepped through the illusion and quickly looked around the chamber for Imeralda.
 But she was nowhere to be seen.
 He ran to the base of the One Tree finding that it took longer to run from the door to the tree than he had expected.
 It was huge.

Thomas and I had fallen out because of his continued preference for drugs and that lifestyle and an inclination toward our biological father’s proclivity for untruths and big scams.
 The last thing I wanted was for Thomas to be a part of this.
 Oh, how he would rub my face in this shit.
 You would think with all my experience around drugs that I would have known what to do.
 That is exactly what I thought!
 Brandon was sickly and skinny.
 My wife lay with him for hours rubbing his back and keeping fluids in him.
 He went from cold to hot and back again.
 In a couple of weeks he was looking much healthier and we sent him out into the world again.
 Turns out, just because I did drugs and knew people who were addicted to drugs I was still not qualified to understand how to break someone from craving the drugs that satisfy their addiction.

"Oh, I'm sorry to bug you with such a stupid mistake."
 "Don't worry about it.
 I'm just glad it was that easy.
 I've been worried all day someone would stump me on something right out of the gate on my first day."
 Rachel looked up at me through dark lashes as I stood.
 "I've wanted to say thanks for a while.
 I really appreciate you making Cassie back down yesterday.
 Nobody else has ever stood up for me like that.
 At least not people that I didn't already know."
 Based on what I'd seen less than thirty hours ago, it didn't look like her friends stood up for her either.

“Did you ever walk in your garden before that morning you walked into my garden?” “Of course.
 I love to walk in the garden.” “So that one morning, there was just a-a door or something.
 All the other mornings there wasn’t.
 So just because you tried hard this morning, that doesn’t mean that trying hard tomorrow or the next day or the next won’t work.” She smiled.
 “That’s true.” “So you’ll keep trying.” “Yes.” “Now I’m sad.”  He met her eyes and then looked away.
 “I’m sorry.”  She hugged him, laying her head on his shoulder.
 “I just wish I could make you happy.” “You do.”  She raised her head to look at him.
 “You do make me happy, Rick.

Per capita meat production is expected to grow by 60 per cent and milk production by 20 per cent.
 During the same period, malnutrition is projected to decline to 640 million persons, constituting 11.6 per cent of the population of developing countries, a little over half the level in 1990.
 Yet the achievements have not been uniform throughout the developing world.
 Per capita food production has actually declined in more than half of all developing countries over the past 15 years.
 In 18 countries with high rates of population growth, primarily in Africa, it has been deteriorating for the past three decades.
 While the Near East, North Africa, East Asia and Latin America/Caribbean regions are expected to achieve average food supplies of 3,000 calories per day by 2010, 200 million people will still be malnourished in South Asia and 300 million, or one-third of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, will suffer from severe food deficits.
 Due to rapidly expanding population, agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa would have to grow at four per cent annually in order significantly to improve per capita availability of food.
 Thus far, only East Asia has sustained such high growth rates in agriculture, averaging 6.1 per cent from 1970 to 1990.
 This trend, if not halted and reversed, casts a renewed spell of gloom over the hopes of hundreds of millions of people to escape from hunger, and over all our hopes for peace in the twenty-first century.
 The projection of future prospects based on past trends is especially questionable with regard to food.

Inock killed the first hunter and would have done likewise to the second, but Adjam sprang upon his brother, knocking him away before the second man could be harmed."
 Alec's fingers slowly caressed my stomach as he spoke.
 It should have tickled, but instead it lulled me even further towards oblivion.
 "And thereby the full effect of the Earth's curse was felt.
 Trapped as they were in their beast forms, neither brother could talk to the other, and the resulting confrontation quickly spun out of control.
 Hours later Adjam was left bleeding and broken as his brother disappeared into the night."
 Alec's soothing voice continued on, but I'd lost the ability to listen.
 My mind floated off into visions of a battered wolf who dragged himself over to a brook before collapsing on the bank, streaked with mud.
 Just before the blackness carried me completely away, a willowy girl appeared from behind a thicket of trees and timidly approached the bleeding figure.
 Chapter 30 The cool night air dimpled my skin despite the warmth of Alec's chest.

“Maybe it’s something you should think about.”  He ran his thumb over her lower lip.
 “You deserve better, Marie.”  He tilted her chin up, touching his lips to hers.
 When she didn't pull away, he repeated the feather-light touch.
 He felt her breath, the quivering of her lips.
 He kissed the corner of her mouth and nuzzled her cheek.
 Gathering her closer, he began taking her lips in one soft kiss after another.
 But as her response grew warmer, his kisses became hungrier.
 Marie was growing hot and felt almost drugged by Rick's kisses.
 She ran one hand over his chest, wishing that his shirt had buttons so that she could undo one and slip her hand inside.

It seeks to tap the country's competitive advantage in labour-intensive agricultural crops and allied industries to double agricultural production - raising the annual growth rate to 4 per cent (versus 2.3 per cent in the 1980s) - achieve complete nutritional self-sufficiency, raise rural incomes and double India's total exports.
 Creating new jobs through this low-cost strategy can be accomplished entirely with the country's own resources, though foreign firms will find investment in India's agro-industrial sector very attractive.
 Initially, about half of the new jobs will be generated on farms by raising productivity through methods to improve management of micro-nutrients and water, expanding the total irrigated area by more complete utilization of the substantial additional capacity that has already been created, emphasis on more labour-intensive commercial crops such as sugar, cotton, fruit, flowers, and vegetables, sericulture, inland and coastal aquaculture, reclamation of wastelands for forestry and fodder, and increasing subsidiary incomes from animal husbandry and poultry.
 The expansion and intensification of cultivation of these products will raise agricultural output by $25 billion and generate approximately 45 million equivalent full-time unskilled and semi-skilled jobs in agriculture for unemployed and under-employed farmers and landless labour.
 The additional agricultural production will form raw material for expansion of rural industrialization and non-farm employment.
 Another 10 million jobs will be created in downstream agro-industries located in rural areas - in sugar mills, cotton and textile mills, processing units for fruit, fish and silk, and in marketing and distribution - thus serving as a counter-magnet to urban migration.
 Growth of agro-industry will stimulate demand for industrial machinery and services.
 The multiplier effect of skyrocketing rural demand will stimulate demand in a broad range of consumer industries and create an estimated 45 million rural and urban jobs in industry and services.
 Funding for the strategy would come from a mix of public sector and private sector investment.
 The funding requirements are within the range of current five-year projections: 84 per cent of additional planned investment in agriculture and 25 per cent of additional planned expenditure in industry.

I knew it was going to be bad, could feel it in a sickening, only-seconds-away-from-vomiting kind of way, but couldn't follow the chain of logic through to the very end.
 I let Jasmin help me pull my books together, and then numbly followed her out to the hallway.
 Alec and the rest of the pack were waiting for us at my locker.
 Jasmin calmly opened my locker and put my things away while I was still trying to come to terms with everything.
 Alec took my hand.
 "Are you okay?"
 I shook my head.
 "This is going to be really bad, isn't it?"
 His silence validated my belief, probably even more than he realized.
 "I'd...we'd...spare you it if we could."

Then he shifted his gaze toward Imeralda’s large green eyes.
 As their eyes held he slid over to her, running the back of his hand across her cheek.
 “You are so beautiful, your skin so soft,” Rodregas said.
 “You are the complete woman; beautiful, intelligent, brave.” He reached down and placed his finger below her chin and raised it up to be equal in height to his.
 “I have wanted you since I first saw you,” and with that straight forward statement, he reached down, and holding her face steady with his single finger, he slowly, softly kissed her.
 For a moment she tried to pull away, but he kept the pressure of his finger steady and firm so she could feel his desire.
 He made his lips eager but light, not too forceful.
 He was strong and he let her feel his strength, but he also gave her plenty of leverage so that if she truly wanted to pull away she could.
 He was making his desire clear, but the decision was hers.
 He cared for her too much, and was so determined to walk the path of righteousness and he was determined to be very careful.

 And then this sword here has our name…‌kind of.”
 Qurrah stared at the name, thinking.
 “He was an elf,” he said.
 “I guess it is possible he was our father, although I feel it more likely a coincidence.
 Our mother was intelligent, at least for an orc, but was she smart enough to leave us clues within our own names?”
 “Well, he’s dead now, so we’ll never know,” Harruq said, tossing the blade onto the floor.
 Qurrah, however, was far from dismayed.

The hour is still in progress.
 There is still time and that time is now.
 The world today has far greater opportunities that ever before, far greater degrees of freedom within which to act to accelerate progress and eradicate suffering.
 The Millennium Development Goals adopted at the UN Millennium Summit in 2000 represent the essential minimum needs for building a stable, secure, free and prosperous global community.
 We confront once again an unprecedented opportunity and an unfinished agenda.
 Disappointed by our failure to achieve all that seemed possible or disillusioned by the emergence of new, more dreadful challenges, some may feel prompted to curb mind’s contemplation of the greater potentials, dispense with lofty plans and resign themselves to the slower, circuitous pace of progress that characterized earlier periods.
 That choice would be unfortunate.
 For everything in our experience of the past two decades points to the fact that humankind is now capable of more rapid and radical action to build a better common present and future for all.
 We may have become habituated to the astounding magnitude of the events since 1989 and still feel unsatisfied with the results, but we can no longer deny that we collectively possess the capacity to create the world that we choose to create.
 This is still the hour in which anything can happen, provided we are determined to make it happen.

None of the other teachers are nearly as strict as Campbell.
 Making you catch up on all that homework is ridiculous."
 My silence seemed to leave my new friend at a loss for words.
 I guess she was used to people agreeing with everything she said.
 I didn't like to lie though, so when I didn't agree with someone I tended not to say anything.
 I guess I didn't think my new task was as unreasonable as it'd first appeared?
 "On the plus side, at least we'll both be at the math lab together.
 I've had to spend an hour there every evening since Dad found out I had the class low on the first test.
 Stupid Internet.
 I can't believe they give our parents an account where they can see how we do on every test."

He shut his mouth.
 “So why are you here?” she asked.
 “I was just, um, I never got a chance to thank you.” Harruq felt his face flush.
 This was the most awful thing he had ever done.
 He’d prefer to face a dragon in unarmed combat.
 He’d have better odds surviving, too, based on Aurelia’s cold, steeled look.
 “You came all the way out here to thank me?
 Hardly sounds like an orcish thing to do.”
 One would not have thought gray skin could turn so red, but it did.
 “Well, I still want to repay you.” Harruq held out a small bag containing copper coins.

The story of this world’s gods is not lengthy, nor complicated, but it is a story that you must learn.
 “Celestia created the rock, the grass, and the water.
 Her hand formed the wildlife, and to tend her creation she created elves.
 The goddess gave them long life and abundant land so quarrels within their race were of the petty sort.
 Then the brother gods came.
 Ashhur of Justice, Karak of Order.
 There are many worlds beyond our own, Qurrah.
 I have seen fleeting glimpses of them in my dreams.
 Karak and Ashhur came from one of those worlds, and Celestia welcomed them.
 To them she gave the grasslands and rolling hills.

The flames that he had called forth to steal the AElfin maiden’s magical abilities now burned him.
 The timing had been near impossible.
 The spell calling forth the flames of creation could only burn one life.
 But the timing was perfect; Ravenhurr called forth the fire, and then he was in it.
 The flames consumed his body in seconds, and flaring from the circle went the multi-colored energy of his magic, the one element that the circle was designed to protect from the flames.
 His magic power shot out of the circle and started orbiting the larger circle.
 He was completely gone.
 Rodregas excitedly thought, “Victory!” He had done it.
 He had killed the Immortalist Sorcerer Ravenhurr.
 The multi-colored energy of his magic swirled around the outer circle and was sucked into the empty vessel of the young man.

He wrenched me beside him, jerking unnecessarily, and then shoved me through the door to my room.
 I listened, but his steps did not recede.
 I tried the door; it was already bound.
 I threw myself onto the bed.
 I felt absolutely wretched.
 Actually, I felt worse than that.
 I felt as if I’d been poisoned.
 The room spun and I heaved over the edge of the mattress.
 When I woke late the next morning, I was covered in sweat.
 My head spun as I stood, but I steadied myself and moved to the basin to splash my face.

I'd been wrong.
 The floors were a gorgeous marble which drew the eyes to the nearest golden-white wall, and up the elaborate gilded trim towards vaulted ceilings.
 It was like walking into a palace, complete with painted, spun-sugar clouds, and burgundy drapes made out of rich velvet.
 If it wasn't for the press of people pushing me from behind, I probably would've stayed in the front entryway right up until the sound of the orchestra filtered down to me.
 As it was, I only got a few hurried looks before being rushed along with the rest of the students.
 Seeing all of my classmates looking utterly bored as they allowed themselves to be herded through the most amazing building I'd ever seen brought me back to my original train of thought.
 I hadn't actually spent every waking moment thinking about Les Misérables.
 A fair number of those seconds had been spent with Brandon.
 He'd already been picking me up from school every morning and dropping me off most days.
 We now spent every lunch together, and he'd started lingering when he dropped me off.

At that time everything was equal—my taste was still developing.
 So I was indiscriminately borrowing from everywhere, from any 45 that came across my little portable spinner, it was all equal, you know, it was all music, Lee Hazlewood or Howlin’ Wolf or Roy Orbison or Serge Gainsbourg.
 I remember I had this Terry Callier 45, “Look at me Now,” and I thought it was every bit as good as “Rock Around the Clock” or the Sun stuff or “Lemon Tree”—(laughs)—I didn’t know, man,  I mean it all seemed good to me.
 And I taught myself to play it all.
 CM:  	This was what year?
 BG:  	Lessee, I was nine or ten so…
 CM: 	And that’s your earliest musical memory?
 BG:  	Yeah.
 Oh, naw, no.
 I mean, I was about five and my parents had this set of records, this Reader’s Digest set, and there was this one song that I fell in love with on it, used to go around the house, scatting it, at five.

It seemed amazing to me that they were willing to move so quickly around normal, uninformed humans, but apparently they figured professional dancers were at least as quick.
 I shook my head and turned back to Rachel, only to feel my throat constrict as I saw Britney.
 Not only was she wearing a tight, black dress that made her look at least twice as hot as me, she also happened to be draped across Brandon's arm.
 I was so caught up watching Britney that it took me several seconds to notice the differences in her date.
 Brandon had always exuded a sense of confidence, but sometime since I'd last seen him, it had morphed into something even more aggressive.
 He still cut through crowds, but people weren't moving out of his way out of deference anymore.
 Instead they were dodging away to avoid being run over.
 I felt the fine hair on the back of my neck stand on end, but was distracted by Alec's return before I could figure out what else had changed about Brandon.
 Jasmin pulled Rachel to her feet, and gently pushed her towards Alec before casually taking a seat next to me.
 It was a careful act.

Johnny – Is that the best you can come up with?
 Jim – What’s wrong with the idea?
 Liz – Think long and hard for a minute about all the people Gene has pissed off over the years.
 How many of them do you think would donate money to help him out.
 Jim – Point made.
 Well isn’t there some sort of loophole we can take advantage of?
 Liz – We looked.
 The only thing that comes close is a clause that makes the whole argument null and void if Eugene’s father dies.
 Johnny – And his father is healthy as an ox.
 Jim – Damn.

He spotted Antonil’s attacker, screamed an incomprehensible challenge, and then charged.
 The elf fired another arrow but was horrified to see it sail high.
 Behind him, Antonil delivered another kick, this time aiming for the elf’s knee instead of his bow.
 The elf had to dodge the kick, and that dodge was all it took.
 The half-orc swung his glowing black blades, cutting his bow, and his body, in twain.
 As the blood poured free, he roared, looked about, and then ran off toward the sound of combat.
 A frail form in rags followed from inside the house, a mirror image in looks but for the paler skin and lack of muscle.
 “You saw nothing,” this second half-orc said to him before following the warrior.
 Antonil struggled to his feet, shaking his head all the while.
 “It keeps getting stranger,” he muttered.

 Johnny – The man has made up his mind.
 Jim – Could we get the law struck down as pointless and un-constitutional?
 Liz – It would cost too much money.
 Jim – We could hold a fund raiser.
 Johnny – Is that the best you can come up with?

The next day things had calmed down, and Brandon admitted to needing professional help, more than we could offer.
 He had been living on less since he was on lock-down and that was lowering the level in the tests, but he was really never without Oxy.
 It was late 2008 and my business was suffering the effects of the economic meltdown.
 Just a couple of years before that my business income had been five times what it was then.
 Bryce, in college, was working three jobs to pay his own expenses, something we could no longer afford to help with.
 Simply put, we were falling behind on everything and we didn’t have the money to put Brandon in a rehab; so we began searching the internet for someplace that would take him without an exorbitant amount of cash.
 The State run agencies were crammed with voluntary admissions and court ordered treatment.
 Brandon’s girlfriend, Tiffanie had already been in a thirty-day rehab twice before.
 We had heard plenty of horror stories from her about her stint in the county rehab: Apparently, several people had over-dosed on drugs while in the facility, one had died, and she had relapsed and used Oxy while she was in there.
 The problem with a facility that accepts court ordered patients is that the patient doesn’t want to be there.

“You seem to be really good at magic,” I offered.
 He chuckled.
 “Is that so?” “Yes, well, I… I need to learn.” “Learn?” The humor was gone again.
 “What do you mean learn?” “I’ve never, well, except for fire, and I need someone to teach me… and you’re…” I waved a hand in his direction.
 His brow rose.
 “I don’t understand,” he said, clearly concerned about my mental state.
 Maybe I was a few nuts short of a bushel.
 “I’ve lost my mentor.
 Can you teach me magic?
 Help me, so I don’t do something out of order, hurt myself?” His eyebrows drew down, coming together as he began his reply, but a fallen branch cracked at the edge of the clearing and his head snapped toward it.

Dylan asking, “How does it feel to be on your own like a complete unknown?” and I kept thinking about that and I was one gone gommie.
 I was feckless.
 I couldn’t see myself in the mirror.
 There was still hope but, damn, it was spinning too fast.
 It seemed like every fucking day something was happening that you had to respond to, you know?
 To not respond was to be dead, to be irrelevant.
 “Won’t you please come to Chicago just to sing?” you know?
 I thought, yeah, I could, I could.
 But, in the end, I didn’t, I didn’t do a fucking thing.
 I couldn’t.

She must have filled him in on my problem.
 I resisted the urge to touch him.
 I always wanted to touch him.
 “Frey,” Chevelle began in a measured tone.
 I cut him off, trying to sound calm.
 “What happened?” “It would seem the council has attacked us.” I was too numb to draw in the quick breath I expected.
 My cheeks tingled.
 I didn’t think I could feel my hands.
 “Attacked you,” he clarified.
 Something came out of my chest that sounded like a moan.

"Not talk about it?"
 Mrs. Tranton shot her husband a warning glance.
 Marie had surely been through a very traumatic experience, and they shouldn't make her talk about it until she was ready.
 "Why don't I have Louise make us some breakfast, and we can talk," Mrs. Tranton suggested.
 "If you can take your hands off our daughter long enough."
 Mrs. Tranton smiled.
 She'd been caressing Marie's hair and shoulders and arms.
 "You seem to be having a problem with that yourself."
 He grunted, stroking Marie's cheek and then tilting her chin up.
 "We have been out of our minds with fear.

The bark of the branch was smoother and offered less of a grip.
 Finally he got to the top, which was broad and actually rather cup-like against the main trunk.
 Though he worried about Imeralda, he let himself rest for a moment to recover.
 After a few minutes Rodregas got up and looked around for Imeralda.
 He saw that she was actually far out on another impossibly think branch.
 By the Infernals he swore to himself.
 She was a Forest Nymph.
 He thought he should just leave her there.
 She could do this far easier than he.
 Rodregas had an urge to leap from his branch to the other like a cat.

"What a pretty sculpture," Marie said, admiring a small porcelain garden filled with flowers and a water wheel.

 "What?"
 "Clap your hands."
 Marie did so, and music played as water began to make the water wheel turn.
 "Oh!
 It's a fountain!
 How does it work?"
 "It runs on battery, and it's sound-activated."
 When the music and water stopped, Marie clapped her hands again.

Ravenhurr seemed eager to have him visit, which was unusual for him.
 Ravenhurr was usually very solitary.” “What else do you remember about their conversation or about Van’dret?” asked Imeralda of Rodregas.
 “Nothing, I was a guard who did my duty and kept my nose out of things.
 I know little of most Immortalists other than what is common knowledge.” The four talked a bit more and then split up.
 To Rodregas’ discomfort, Jordaan and Imeralda left together.
 Doi’van trailed the others and then stepped back toward Rodregas room.
 Rodregas sagged against the bed, the wound of losing Imeralda hurting more than those of his flesh.
 “You said you knew she was a Nymph,” stated Doi’van.
 Rodregas nodded.
 He wanted sympathy, but he knew that the straight talking Doi’van was not likely to give him any.

“Wait, why do we have to go?
 What is this destiny?” The dwarf gave a feeble smile.
 “All of you must free our world from darkness, from him.” *** Seth and I walked back to our clearing, both our brains not thinking.
 It was too much to take in at once.
 Destroy Kojas?
 We could barely take on a mass of monsters without dying, so how were we suppose to take down an evil, powerful demon?
 As the trees parted away to show the empty ground, I spotted Emily and Jason looking like they were about to go to war with a bunch of sticks.
 When they saw us appear, both dropped their weapons and smiled at us.
 Typical cover up.
 “Hey Seth, it looks like Jazell didn’t kill you after all,” Emily said and flashed me a grin.

The only answer I receive is a maybe.
 But all I need is to recognize the long shot possibility that the dearest person I have known gave his life for me and, despite the sorrow, my heart leaps with adoration.
 For a moment on Highway 101 in Pismo Beach, I feel sure that Eric was Jesus.
 Not in full, as in a Second Coming.
 But in a way so that Jesus entered him and took possession.
 While this thought grips me, both Eric and Jesus become so precious the word adore feels timid and weak.
 Cliff and Toni
 A semi cuts in front of me while we climb Cuesta grade, just north of San Luis Obispo.
 Surrounded by semis, I decide I had better return to the mundane world.
 The last dozen miles to Cliff’s home in Atascadero I spend wondering if I could possibly write something that might introduce Cliff, Billy, and Bob to God.

"Then why did she agree to it?"
 "Because Lauri's as good at badgering as I am.
 See you tomorrow."
 Rick shook his head as Ted left his office.
 He knew his friend meant well, but he despised fix-ups.
 The last time he'd gone to Ted and Lauri's, Lauri had spent fifteen minutes scolding him for letting his date go home alone.
 She'd been a nice enough girl, but she'd had her own car at dinner, and it would have been totally ridiculous for him to offer to drive her home.
 According to Lauri, however, Beth would have accepted the offer and returned later to get her car, just for the chance to be alone with him.
 He was glad then that he hadn't offered.
 How could he respect a woman who would do something so silly?

 Dieredon was stunned by the simple fact that he was awake.
 He had expected death.
 He had also expected darkness.
 Instead, the welcoming light of morning met his eyes when he leaned up and looked around.
 The elf smiled, then laughed.
 They had walked right over him but not seen him.
 “Thank you, Celestia,” he said, his smile remaining even as the pain in his ribs and shoulder reawakened.

We had Brandon on complete lockdown at our house with no visitors allowed, searching his room and the entire house daily.
 We ordered professional quality drug tests so we could test him every day.
 Brandon experienced the worst of the drug withdrawals in the first few days after his arrest.
 My wife, Lisa sat on the bathroom floor with him during his lowest moments.
 He vomited until he had nothing left.
 He curled up in the fetal position, chanting inaudible ramblings and contorting to the point that we had to pad the doorframe and cabinets with towels to keep him from banging his head and limbs.
 In the twelfth hour of fetal position rocking, infantile whimpering, sickening dry heaves and panicked breathing, I broke out my video camera, thinking I’d just tape a reminder: He can’t possibly ever want to do this again.
 His mother on the bathroom floor alongside him, cushioning his head before it smacks the doorframe, stroking his back and newly shorn hair.
 I am defined again by this moment, disgusted by myself, but in a warped way triumphant: You see, you see you little shit— what happens when you don’t listen to me?
 He was a walking skeleton and you could see his every rib.

(laughs) That was freshman year—Debbie, she was freshman year.
 And my gigs with my new band.
 Man, everything was happening.
 I started to lose myself when I played, you know, and it was kind of frightening, where I’d go when I played.
 I wasn’t even aware of Skippy and Crafty, except as background thunder, a wall I was bouncing off of.
 And, like sex, I was gone, man.
 At first I almost blacked out, it was so intense, but you learn to control it, right?
 I mean, I learned to let myself soar, to let myself fall into it, to not be afraid.
 You step up to the edge of the cliff and you think—you think—you can fly, but you’re really not sure.
 It’s that first jump that’s scary.

 “He doesn’t.
 He doesn’t spend much time with me or try to comfort me when I’m upset.
 He-he doesn’t—“  She swallowed, her face turning red as she thought, his kisses don’t make me hot like yours do.

Of course, leaving a little magic left over would be great if I can, but you never really know until after the searing.” Rodregas paused and then added, “The problem is that only two groups in the Eastern Realms have the knowledge to do the searing.
 The first, of course, is the Guild of the Celestial Path.
 I think we all agree they are not sharing it with me soon,” Rodregas continued with a smile.
 “And the second is the Knightly Order of the Soaring Heavens, who are reported to have the greatest collection, and they only let their knights be seared.
 I don’t think they are going to be sharing anytime soon either.” Imeralda looked at Rodregas.
 She knew that the Order of the Soaring Heavens was the order that Rodregas had belonged to as a squire, but his taking on of another’s body was anathema to the teaching of the order.
 Rodregas was an Immortalist in fact, if not a member of the Guild, and he was pretty sure most of the knights would kill him if they found out his story.
 “But don’t some wizards have the secrets for some of the lesser sigils?” asked Doi’van, joining the conversation.
 “I thought a lot of them used ones that help wizards not to grow old.” “That is true,” said Imeralda with a shrug.
 “A healing sigil is why wizards live so long.

I mean, these couples using the opportunity to practically hump on the dance floor, hands all over asses, the chaperons looking bored over in the corner, old Ricky Glass, the mechanical drawing teacher, toking up.
 What a time that was.
 Anyway, Carol was suddenly there.
 When I stepped off the stage between gigs there was Debbie with this blond young woman I’d never even noticed in the halls of Central High, so tuned out I was, so really out of the swim as far as high school was concerned.
 I mean, if I’d been paying attention I would never have missed Carol Warner.
 We even had a class together.
 (laughs)  Here’s this blond chick, in a loose shirt that I couldn’t help but look down at two lovely mounds of white white flesh, and a little jean skirt that showed off legs as thick as bedposts, strong, muscular legs—she was on the track team, imagine that—and sweet Debbie, my first love, didn’t know what she was doing, introducing us.
 I mean she put the match to the fireworks and I think regretted it immediately.
 Apparently, Carol asked to meet me.
 Like a fan thing.

Die.
 Collapse.
 Fear.
 Failure._
 An apparition swirled before him, blacker than the shadows, red eyes smoldering.
 Its rank claws touched his face, turning the sweat on his brow to ice.
 The arrow squirmed deeper.
 Qurrah focused every bit of his will upon it, desperately seeking to repulse it.
 His well of energy, which he’d thought empty, burgeoned and over-flowed.
 The arrow snapped, banishing the necromancer’s presence, but leaving a solitary impression squatting at the back of Qurrah’s mind:

Torn, definitely.
 She loved Rick.
 She wanted to marry him.
 But she wanted to go home too.
 "I hope my mother doesn't faint when she sees me."
 "You really miss her."
 "Yes.
 There have been times in the last five weeks when I really needed her.
 Needed to talk to her."
 "When you get back, what are you going to talk to her about?"

It felt good being there, surrounded by my new companions, a fire and stories, laughter.
 This was more of a home than Fannie’s had ever been.
 But I was also under the influence of a fairy.
 “Better yet?” Ruby asked.
 I grimaced.
 Grey approached.
 “Ruby dear, won’t you allow us to partake?” “Speak for yourself,” Anvil cracked from across the fire, “last time I lost a bit of tongue.” I cringed and remembered my dream.
 I thought I could still smell burning flesh.
 Ruby laughed.
 “Ah, well, I suppose just this once.” Grey sat, rough brown boots resting among the stone, and she leaned over him as if for a kiss.

Now come.” The two resumed traveling up the small hill.
 They stopped again, however, for from their vantage point they could see the village.
 “See the torches?” Harruq asked, pointing.
 His brother nodded.
 “Velixar’s nightmares have pulled them from their slumber.
 It would be too easy otherwise.”
 “It’s going to be easy anyway,” Harruq said, drawing his blades.
 The soft red glow splashed across their faces.
 “Are you ready, brother?”
 “I am,” he lied.

He'd begun feeling smothered.
 Gina had talked of nothing but marriage from their fifth or sixth date until he'd broken up with her.
 She'd sobbed and told him over and over how much she loved him and begged him not to break up with her.
 A month later he'd read of her engagement to another man.
 He'd actually proposed to Kim, but once she had the ring, all she'd wanted to talk about was what pieces she was going to buy to refurnish the house and at which resorts they were going to spend their summers and how much of his money was in the bank and how much in land investments.
 He'd broken up with her six weeks after proposing.
 He'd never gotten the ring back, of course.
 He was lonely.
 Rick sighed, setting down the carton of fried rice and leaning back.
 That was why he’d been foolish enough to ask Kim to marry him, he now realized.

When he climbed into bed, he fell asleep instantly.
 Not long after, Harruq rose, took his swords, and left for his own meeting.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 “You’re late,” Aurelia said, stepping out from behind a tree.
 Harruq shrugged and held out two branches he had whittled into crude imitations of swords.
 “Had to make something for me to spar you with,” he said.
 “Those sticks are unnecessary,” Aurelia said as she took up her staff, the tiniest hint of a smile curling on her lips.
 “Draw your swords.”
 “Are you sure?” Harruq asked, raising an eyebrow and gesturing to her completely unarmored figure.

There seemed to be some kind of sign or symbol.
 It was two circles with a sword through the center of both.
 “Seth, look!” I said and pointed to it.
 He came over and bent down, tracing the sign with his finger.
 I waited and finally said, “Well, do you know what it is?” Seth dropped his finger.
 “It means, 'slayer of worlds'.
 Does that ring a bell?” “How do you know that?” I asked.
 He shrugged.
 “I don't know how, I just do.
 Maybe that's my power.” “Well, I want to go this way,” I said and pointed to the entrance.

For a second nothing made sense.
 Brandon was the one who was saving us, and if that wasn't out of the ordinary, I didn't know what would be.
 Only he'd said in his note not to say anything to anyone.
 Of course.
 He was testing me, making sure I was going to keep quiet about what he'd done.
 Probably because he didn't want any of the praise for such a selfless act.
 I was usually a pretty lousy liar, but it isn't really a lie if you both know the truth.
 "Brandon, you can trust me.
 There isn't anything odd going on.
 At least nothing odder than normal for Sanctuary."

The failure of the transition strategy to produce the anticipated results has given rise to extreme hardship, growing anxiety, frustration and anger within these countries.
 Internationally, it has generated intense debate about the reasons for the failure, the efficacy of ‘shock therapy’, and the appropriateness and adequacy of Western assistance.
 These questions reflect an inadequate understanding, both within and outside the region, of the stages and process and essential conditions for an effective transition under the circumstances prevalent in Eastern Europe at the time.
 Understanding of this failure holds the key not only to the rapid revitalization of the former Soviet and other Eastern European republics, but also to meeting the challenges of present and future transitions in Africa, Asia and the West.
 This understanding can be summarized in the form of several lessons that can be derived from the general experience of countries in the region.
 1.Multi-dimensional transitions cannot be brought about by uni-dimensional strategies: The economic dimension of transition cannot be viewed and acted upon in isolation from its political and social dimensions.
 The reform programme was developed and guided by domestic and foreign economists who viewed the transition much like a change of clothing – the casting off of one set of economic principles and the adoption of another – ignoring the critical importance of social and political factors.
 This view could be summed up in the often expressed attitude, ‘Good economics makes good politics!’
 Transition is the process by which society moves from one form or level of activities to another.
 While social scientists conveniently divide social activity into several categories – political, economic, social, educational, religious, cultural – in practice these distinctions are at best only partially true.

If I turn on a radio talk show, I usually want to argue.
 Those pastimes aren’t good for me.
 So, on long trips in my old Toyota I listen to hymns, gospel music and such.
 As I set off on this trip, half book promotion tour and half vacation, I’m wrestling with Brother Lawrence and the question, why don’t I adore God?
 I plan to drive up the West Coast, San Diego to Seattle, and stop over with Cliff Torrey in Atascadero and Bob Williams in Portland.
 Lots of years ago, I attended a Billy Graham crusade with these two friends.
 I listened, got moved, and turned to Christ.
 Cliff made a profession but, as far as I know, never followed up.
 Bob declined the invitation.
 What sent us to the crusade began with Eric Curtis.

Let’s talk about you.
 (garbled)
 CM: 	So, it’s ok to say that you had a complete nervous breakdown at this time?
 BG:  	Yeah, sure.
 That’s what it was.
 I found myself with existential nausea, the kind you wake up with in the morning and it’s all over you like an animal and there’s nowhere to go because the beast is you.
 I often backed myself into a corner and curled there like a fetus, as if covering my balls and stomach were protection, as if I feared some attack of a physical nature.
 This is what the fear does to you.
 It’s totally debilitating, man.
 Nausea can unseat you, can defeat the strongest man.

Johnny – That’s just retarded.
 Jim – If you think that’s bad just read the issue where both Sumo and Skinny died, and then were resurrected by the Schizophrenic Bi-polar Doctor as zombies.
 Johnny – What did he do that for?
 Jim – Not a clue, mom caught me before had a chance to finish the comic.
 I later heard that it was considered to be both the best and worst Sumo Assassin comic ever.
 Never have been able to find another copy.
 Ah well, it doesn’t really matter.
 Johnny – Good thing you don’t really like the series.
 Jim – I never said I didn’t like the Sumo Assassin.
 Johnny – Yeah you did.

I could control nothing but my mind, and that just barely.
 As my eyes closed again, I reached out and found my horse as he lay motionless on the ground, my Steed.
 He wasn’t dead.
 I asked him to stand and tried to impress upon him to follow.
 I hoped it had worked as I faded into blackness.
 Chapter Fifteen Fortress
 My mind regained consciousness very slowly.
 I was hit with blurry images first, sights and scenes that melded into hazy dreams.
 Eventually they became clearer, though they didn’t make much sense.
 After a time it occurred to me the problem was the images were mixing with the wrong sounds… real sounds.

She'd had one deliciously forbidden cocktail--alcohol had been illegal for seven years now--but that was enough to satisfy her curiosity and yearning for adventure.
 She felt pleasantly lightheaded, but she didn't want to get drunk.
 They left at 11:30 as Marie had promised, and Tom was relieved that no one was awake at her house.
 Uncle Jefferson was extremely protective of her, trusting her only with Tom himself and with Davis Runyon, her beau.
 Tom didn't much trust Davis.
 He might not take her to a disreputable place like tonight's speakeasy, but Tom thought that Davis was a cold opportunist who saw Marie as part of a package deal--a high position in a successful company, a powerful father-in-law, a rich society wife.
 Tom could barely stand to be in the same room with him.
 An only child, he'd always considered Marie more a sister than a cousin.
 He'd adored her all his life, and that made it virtually impossible for him to refuse her anything--like an evening at a speakeasy.
 But it also made him very protective of her.

 "Wait, what do you mean?"
 Alec paused for several seconds before answering.
 "You glow.
 All of the time.
 Until now we always thought someone had to be a shape shifter to do that."
 "But I'm just a normal person.
 Why would I appear different than anyone else?"
 Alec's shrug was enough to send my heart racing again, but not enough to distract me from his words.
 "With shape shifters, we believe it's because the animating energy, the soul if you will, burns more brightly than normal.

 Qurrah crossed his arms.
 “Who is he?”
 The half-orc chuckled.
 “She, not he.
 She saved my life, and she’s also been teaching me to read.”
 “How did she save your life?” Qurrah asked.
 “Remember a few months back when I came home beaten, bloody, and blue?” he asked.
 “Guards caught me trying to sneak inside Maggie’s Tavern.

True mental objectivity can be taught.
 Human fulfilment in the twenty-first century depends on our ability to provide an education that imparts not only material facts, but also the mental perspectives, psychological attitudes, personal values, individual skills and organizational abilities needed for the full blossoming of human resourcefulness and ac complishment.
 Developing Skills
 Improving the quality and quantity of productive skills is essential to implementing the strategies for peace, democratization, food security, economic growth and full employment set forth in this report.
 The phenomenal growth of East Asian countries is the direct result of their massive investments in upgrading the skills of the workforce.
 Rather than generating excess workers, rising productivity has generated greater demand for labour.
 Labour productivity in South Korea rose 11 per cent per year between 1963 and 1979, mostly due to investment in education and skills.
 This increase has been accompanied by a growing shortage of labour, equivalent to 1 per cent of the workforce in 1991.
 Investment in education and training helped Thailand raise labour productivity by 63 per cent during 1980–5.
 It, too, is moving from a labour surplus to a labour shortage economy.

A tandem wolf howl sounded in the distance.
 My stomach swam in unease.
 Chapter Thirteen Diary
 The councilman’s body was disposed of, and the group bustled around the clearing.
 I slid my sword into its sheath, careful not to touch the blade.
 I hadn’t comprehended what the flourish of activity meant until Ruby grabbed my arm to conduct me.
 “Come on, we have to pack.” She dragged me along as she rushed back to her house.
 She threw things around her room, sorting and gathering.
 I didn’t really have anything to assemble.
 There was only the pack I’d acquired months ago, nothing in it but that stupid white dress and the pouch… The pouch.

Harruq bellowed like a bull caught in a cage.
 He jerked against his restraints but they held firm.
 Aurelia calmly walked over, raised her staff, and tapped him on the chest.
 “Three,” she said.
 The half-orc roared his protest.
 Aurelia swung the staff with all her strength.
 The end cracked against Harruq’s cheek.
 Blood shot from his mouth.
 “Four!” she shouted.
 The fierce pain appeared to knock some sense into him.

“It was an accident.
 I didn’t know you’d run that way.” “Alright, we understand that we’ve all done stupid, foolish things.
 So let’s just add this accident to my list, okay?” I said quickly before the two started something.
 They nodded but shot each other smirks.
 I sighed, wondering why those two buffoons had been granted this power along, with Emily and me.
 It’s not like they weren’t foolish enough already.
 The day when it all changed was still a mystery to us.
 A lot of things happened that didn’t quite make sense.
 The four of us were already best friends.
 We were walking through the woods, rambling on about how Halloween was almost here and that Ms. Stecher was still giving us too much homework.

It’s about a present Qurrah gave me.
 He’s a softie at times, and this is one of them times.”
 Aurelia smoothed his hair in her fingers, frowned, and then sliced off a large chunk with the incredibly sharp dagger.
 Brown hair fell in clumps at Harruq’s feet.
 “You’re going to leave me some up there, right?” he asked.
 “Don’t make me cut your ears,” Aurelia warned.
 Harruq began his story.
 He told her of a gift from his brother, a tiny sword Qurrah had whittled from bone.
 A bully had stolen it, but then Qurrah used a dead rat under his control to steal it back while they slept.
 The haircut and the story ended at the same time.

 As expected, he teased me about not waiting for him at my house, but it was a small price to pay for not having to worry about how I was going to get to school if he didn't show up.
 We made small talk and all too soon arrived at school.
 As we pulled into the parking lot I was desperately looking for something witty or insightful to say.
 I needed to give him a reason to stay interested in me, but nothing came to mind.
 As we pulled to a stop, the quiet hum of a cellphone on vibrate broke the strange paralysis that'd gripped me for the last twenty seconds.
 Brandon's grin was more than a little sheepish as he fished his phone out of a front pocket and checked to see who was calling.
 I didn't need his groan to know it was one of his friends.

I didn’t, man.
 We were playing that weekend, I think.
 But, it was like, he’s dead, you know?
 He’s dead forever.
 What does one day have to say about forever?
 You follow me?
 But, he was the best of us.
 Write that.
 He was the best of us.

The market system – basing itself on property rights and self-determined initiatives of the individual producer and consumer – is an economic expression of the same principle.
 Both democracy and market-oriented economies decentralize authority and decision making, providing the essential legal and regulatory framework and empowering the individual to choose and act with minimum direction or interference from above.
 Both depend for their success on the quality of those choices, which means on the quality of education and information possessed by the mass of people, and on the freedom and dynamism of the population.
 In contrast, authoritarian systems and command economies centralize decision making, restrict the flow of information to the public, foster vast unresponsive bureaucracies, limit individual freedom and initiative within narrow bounds, and encourage obedience and conformity rather than innovation.
 The spread of education, which fosters independent thinking, and dissemination of information through the media were important factors in undermining public acceptance of communism in Eastern Europe.
 In a real sense, it was Gorbachev’s policy of glasnost that brought down the Iron Curtain.
 It opened up an insular society and exposed it to an avalanche of new information, new ideas and new possibilities, which released a fervent aspiration in the people for a better life.
 Over the last few years, democratization has been especially dynamic in Africa, where it has been dubbed Africa’s Second Liberation.
 During the first three decades of post-colonial independence, almost all of the continent’s 54 states had come under either single-party or military rule.
 The preference for authoritarian rule was often justified by the need for rapid economic development, which could be impeded by opposition to government policies and by the need to contain regional and tribal conflicts.

The three of us escaped around the office building, down the front steps to the street, where we ran into Laura.
 Though in four years she would become my wife, I hardly knew her and didn’t realize yesterday was her birthday.
 She asked me to sit on the grass for a minute.
 Staring across the ball fields, she said, “Just last week he promised that for my birthday he was going to give me a very special present, only I wouldn’t understand it for a long, long time.
 So he goes and gets killed on my birthday.
 What’s that mean?” I shrugged.
 We hugged stiffly.
 Then we parted and went our own ways.
 A few minutes later, I stumbled into my mom’s classroom at La Mesa Junior High School, while Billy and Cliff waited in my car.
 My mom was lecturing about prepositions.

Marie was in the living room with her mother and brother, and they jumped when they heard him begin shouting.
 They'd had only enough time to look at each other in bewilderment when Mr. Tranton joined them.
 "Young Runyon will be here within the hour."
 Understanding dawned, and Marie said quietly, "He didn't want to come until after work, did he?"
 "There's a big account and .

 well, as I said, he'll be here within the hour."
 To Marie's amazement, after her father had bathed, shaved, and dressed, he rejoined them in the living room with a cup of coffee.

All that shit about he left his roots behind, he broke up a great band, etc.
 I mean, fuck that.
 It’s like Lennon, you know—he was always a solo artist.
 That’s what I think anyway.
 I mean, in the middle of Beatlemania, when he had the fucking world by the tail, we thought, he’s singing “Help me if you can.”  And nobody was listening man.
 He was a squonk crying in the wilderness.
 God love him.
 I think he’s happier now, doing his own shit, not having to answer to anybody except John Lennon.
 That’s the way I am.
 I mean, I’m not claiming to be Lennon—Jesus, no—but, I was always a solo artist and in the straightjacket of a group I was itching to get to the good stuff, the stuff I cared about.

I was miles from toot and half an ocean from weed.
 I would need Brandon to assist me with current drug terms.
 What did an Oxy look like?
 What milligram size I should say I have?
 Brandon told me that the easiest way to buy pills is from people who are prescribed them for chronic pain and intentionally demand more than they need from their doctors so they can resell them at an enormous profit.
 Brandon told me that the Holy Grail for an Oxy dealer was to find an “old guy with a script” (prescription); so I decided this would be who I would become.
 I went to a Wal-Mart and purchased a pre-paid cellular phone that I would use as my undercover phone.
 I didn’t need my last name popping up on a caller I.D.
 I nicknamed the phone my “crack-berry.” After getting crucial information and doing a bit of research, I found the Craigslist classified advertisement with a picture of a young blond girl offering massages with a contact phone number that matched the drug dealer Steve’s number.
 The pictures in the ad were racy and the price per session was about twice the normal cost for such services.

"How about this one?"
 He was wearing a plain blue t-shirt.
 "Yeah."
 She leaned close, inhaling.
 Then she raised her face to nuzzle his neck.
 "You put on fresh cologne."
 "I wanted to be sure I had on enough for the t-shirt to absorb it."
 She kissed his neck.
 "Do you want me to heat up the food?"
 "I'm not hungry."

Who’s coming and is he important?
 Toad dwarf told Seth, “You won’t stop him, little warrior.” Does this mean he’s powerful?
 Toad dwarf said to Jason, “He will destroy all half-ling.” What does “half-ling” mean?
 Toad dwarf said to Emily, “Kill all you like but Kojas will rise.
 Is Kojas the person they’ve been talking about?
 Who is he?
 Toad dwarf said to Jazell, “The one will rise, the one will rise!
 He will destroy you!” Is Kojas’ rising?
 Toad dwarf said to Jason, “The King will rise.” She placed her notes in the middle so we could read it.
 “What does this all mean?” I asked her.

It shouldn't have bothered me, not considering how poorly I'd always fit in; but whether because of his good looks, or for some other unrelated reason, I found myself wanting Alec's approval.
 My breathing started coming faster, exceeded only by the pace of my heart.
 Apparently I wasn't the only one who could tell that working with me wasn't what the school's resident rock star had in mind.
 There was a scattered chorus of badly stifled giggles off to the front of the class.
 Not the normal kind people use when they're amused, but the high-pitched ones girls use to embarrass each other.
 Alec's face unexpectedly softened for a moment, his expression still unwelcoming, but now mixed with a trace of something else.
 While I was busy trying to understand the sudden change, Mrs. Alexander looked at the front of the class with a frown on her face for a moment.
 I suddenly realized that she knew the difference between the two kinds of giggles.
 That was unusual in someone so old.
 The younger teachers usually kept the girls from being too awful to each other, but the old guard didn't really catch the subtle differences high-school girls used to emotionally traumatize each other.

Big city life hadn't been so intrusive.
 I hadn't even known my neighbors growing up.
 In Minneapolis the people you lived next to and the people you associated with were always kept properly segregated.
 I tuned back into what Britney was saying just in time to answer a question with something safely non-committal.
 She didn't seem to need much in the way of responses to keep her talking.
 Probably for hours if she could get away with it.
 "I'm glad you feel the same.
 You'd think they'd be a little more welcoming.
 Instead it's like they go out of their way to make sure you know you don't really fit in.
 We've been here a year, and I still can't get invited to any of the really cool parties."

The bushes and trees rattled and then the woods were silent.
 I could hear everyone's heavy breaths as we turned to face each other.
 Well, actually everyone turned to me.
 “So,” I said and wiped the sweat off my knife's handle, “that was something, wasn't it?” Emily put her hands on her hips.
 “Jazell, how the heck did you know how to kill those things?” She shook her head.
 “What were those things?” “Syphons,” I said.
 “I don't know how I knew where to stab them.
 I just did, alright?
 It was weird.” Seth shook his head and leaned against a tree.
 “How come you get some random power when the rest of us don't?” He gave me a fake pout.

 “Did you practice the spells I taught you?” Velixar asked as Qurrah took his seat by the fire.
 “Yes,” Qurrah said.
 “I am more than pleased with them.”
 “You will need to keep a fresh supply of bones with you,” Velixar said, reaching into his pouch.
 “Take these for now until you can obtain more.”
 Qurrah accepted the bones, stashing them into a small pocket he had sewn onto his robe.
 A silence fell over the two as far away a wolf howled.

It was happening.
 I'd fantasized about kissing even back when I thought boys had cooties.
 I wasn't sure I was any more ready than I'd been out in the parking lot, but I could tell by the way he was moving that he wasn't going to abort this time.
 The tingling was even more intense now as I brought my hand up and cupped the side of his face, and then our lips met.
 It wasn't like I'd imagined.
 His lips were warm, and they had the slightest hint of softness, but there was more urgency and fierceness to the kiss than expected.
 It wasn't as amazing as I'd fantasized, but I was still having a hard time thinking.
 I tried to pull back and catch my breath, but his arms had become steel cables that pulled me in tighter.
 Fear finally overcoming my desire not to look stupid.
 I started to push away from Brandon.

Chapter 23 Someone was calling my name, but I really didn't want to wake up.
 I was still so tired, and I'd had the most wonderful dreams.
 They were a little foggy now, but they seemed to have involved Alec coming to my rescue, and then holding my hand as I went to sleep.
 It wasn't until I finally placed the familiar voice that everything started coming back to me.
 I sat up with an abruptness that nearly knocked Alec off of his perch on the edge of my bed.
 Him still being there, looking at me with a barely restrained amusement glimmering in his eyes, calmed my racing pulse.
 "You're still here."
 "You sound disappointed.
 Do you want me to leave?"
 His expression had taken on the guarded blankness I still hadn't learned how to read, so I wasn't sure whether he was joking or not.

The captain and Dale were both large men but it would have been very difficult to keep such a gifted athlete in the circle, even with clubs, if he was determined to escape.
 However, he was young and clearly lacked battle experience.
 He seemed unsure of what to do.
 Then it was too late; the blue flames of the circle rose high, then inward, and engulfed him.
 The young man started to split in two.
 The physical man stood there, but as he watched, another ethereal version, the man’s spirit, his very non-corporal essence, was suddenly pulled from his body, and then whipped around and out of the burning circle.
 Rodregas was not sure, but as this ethereal version of the man was pulled apart, Rodregas thought he could see him screaming.
 Rodregas pulled his eyes away from the horrifying vision as the corporal man went from looking confused and unsure to having no expression at all, like an empty piece of meat.
 Rodregas’s eyes flinched away from the terrible sight as he felt he might scream in horror and fury at what was happening.
 Then Ravenhurr yelled out, “Spirea faira podia turiana,” and the circle holding the Celestial Lion started to burn in the same blue flames, the blue flames that make up the creation forces of life that can only be called up when the Celestial Realm was close.

She was our class valedictorian in high school.
 When she gave her speech I wanted to stand up and say, “I love her.
 She gave me my first head.”  (laughs)  And I was voted, of course, “most talented.”  But, I’ve skipped ahead.
 We should spend more time in high school, if you know what I mean.
 It’s when I cut my teeth, honed my personality, became, for better or worse, what I became.
 Do you wanna start back in ninth grade now?
 CM:  	Sure.
 Yes.
 Exactly.
 I think when you were in ninth grade you were already something of a legend in Memphis Music circles.

I'd always managed to pull A's or at least A-'s, but hated all of the little nitpicky rules.
 Unfortunately, after missing a whole month of classes, I was at least as bad off in Algebra as I was in Biology.
 Mrs. Campbell was solving problems with so many variables in them it was like watching alphabet soup spontaneously re-arrange itself on her overhead projector.
 Not only that, things were being squared and cubed, an operation with which I had only passing familiarity.
 I struggled valiantly to understand what was going on.
 I got the sense the operations being applied to the formulas were being explained very well, I just didn't have the vocabulary to follow what she was saying.
 By the time class finally ended I was fighting not to become emotional.
 The fact that Britney looked for a moment like she was debating whether or not to wait for me before finally stopping next to the door with her arms crossed, didn't help.
 I threw my book and binder into my backpack and tromped up to the front of the classroom.
 Mrs. Campbell looked up when I reached her desk.

She'd been reunited with her family, learned that her father and brother had reconciled, broken up with Davis, and spent an entire weekday morning with her father.
 She smiled as she reached into her closet for a housedress.
 She would have sworn that her father was more like Davis than like Rick, but she was pleased to realize that he really was more like Rick.
 He'd stayed home from work to be with her, and he'd held her.
 And he hadn't been upset that she'd broken up with Davis.
 He just wanted her to be happy.
 That was what Rick wanted for her.
 Tears tightened her throat as she remembered the anguish on his face when he'd told her that he was the key to the doorway to 1927.
 He'd desperately wanted to keep her with him, to marry her, and he could have kept his discovery to himself and never told her he knew how to help her get home.
 But he'd wanted what was best for her.

He halted instantly, despite there being no way she was strong enough to stop him.
 I doubted she had enough grip strength to slow even me down.
 "Don't be angry with me, Alec.
 You're all I have left."
 "I'm not angry, Mother, but you're wrong.
 You have much more left than just me."
 She shook her head with a youthful smile.
 "Such a good boy."
 Rachel, tears coursing down her face, stormed off as Alec pulled his mother's door shut behind us.
 I started to follow her, but Alec recaptured my hand in his.

I've had a wonderful time, and--" "Shhh--it's OK."  He reached out to caress her hair.
 "I'm glad you've had such a good time here that you don't want to leave."
 "It's been magic, Rick.
 Thank you for bringing me.
 And for getting me into a movie.
 And for doing everything in your power to make this trip special for me."
 "You're very welcome."
 Sliding his arms around her waist, he added, "It's been special for me too."
 She knew he was going to kiss her; she'd known it the second she'd felt his arms go around her waist.
 When his lips touched hers, she clutched at his shirt, but then her hands slid around his waist and up his back.

He looked away as if expecting to be berated for the outburst.
 Instead, Qurrah walked over and put a hand on his brother’s shoulder.
 “Be careful,” he said in his raspy voice.
 “Your power was given at a cost.
 Any hesitation or doubt risks the permanency of your gift.
 I understand, please know that.
 In time, you will learn, and you will see things as I do.
 Until then, rest.
 Velixar will come for us soon.
 I do not want to fail him.

_Qurrah heard himself ask.
 Hands stretched to the heavens, the cloaked man laughed.
 His power surged with the laughter, obliterating Qurrah’s ability to stand._
 Because I am eternal, _said the figure._ I sire war.
 I sow bloodshed.
 I create my dead, and the dead follow.
 What must I do?

 You know the words.

He and his younger brother Bryce were growing apart just as I had grown apart from my brother Thomas, which was torturous for me and Lisa to watch.
 Brandon dressed like some punk and believed he was the smartest person in the room.
 He became a very obnoxious person.
 At some point, we knew he was back into drugs, we just hoped he wasn’t getting himself addicted.
 We were kidding ourselves; we felt so powerless.
 He was gaunt, broken out, nervous and angry, telling random stories that always involved the biggest-fastest-shortest-longest-cue-the-orchestra-everybody fucking him over.
 He’d always have to go save someone in some dramatic fashion.
 The things that would come out of his mouth were completely unbelievable lies and his ignorance was evident to all.
 As a parent, I was humiliated when Brandon spoke.
 We encouraged him to seek help, but as an adult Brandon had to want help and he had to consent to help.

Marie's hands shook as she set her teacup aside.
 She rose just as Davis appeared in the living room.
 "Darling!"
 He crossed the room to draw her into his arms, kissing her cheek.
 "What happened to you?"
 "We're not discussing that right now, Davis," Mrs. Tranton said.
 "We're just enjoying having her back."
 "Of course."
 Davis took her hand, and they sat on the sofa.
 "How have you been, darling?"

Alec nodded like he'd just checked a box off on some kind of mental list.
 "So snow's always been a pretty key ingredient sounds like."
 "I guess.
 It hadn't really sunk in that we wouldn't be getting any of that this year.
 A month ago I would have thought that was a good thing, that it would be one less thing to remind me of Dad and Cindi.
 I think I might actually miss it this year though."
 I rested my head against Alec's shoulder.
 "It doesn't really matter.
 The important thing now is that we're together for Christmas.
 Beyond that I don't really care what happens."

"The other school of thought is that I'm more of a healer than anyone realized, and that I couldn't resist your obvious need."
 He'd lost me there.
 "Wait, what do you mean?"
 Alec paused for several seconds before answering.
 "You glow.
 All of the time.
 Until now we always thought someone had to be a shape shifter to do that."
 "But I'm just a normal person.
 Why would I appear different than anyone else?"
 Alec's shrug was enough to send my heart racing again, but not enough to distract me from his words.

It’s about the biggest there is.” He picked up a handful of sand and let it sift through his fingers.
 “I wish it was.
 I mean, I shouldn’t.
 That’s just being a coward, to wish for things to stay like they are.
 We ought to get excited about changes.
 You, for instance, you ought to jump at the chance to go to Pepperdine.” Though I only remember my mom going to church for funerals, or as far as the front door to pick up a free copy of the Christian Science Monitor, her preference for my education was Pepperdine, a Christian college.
 I suppose she hoped I might find guidance there.
 “In L.A., Ken.
 You could learn to write movies, and still get home in a couple hours if your mom needs you.
 But you don’t want to go.” “State College is almost free.

She still didn't look very happy, but there was a trace more self-control to her face than a few minutes before.
 "Britney, despite spending at least an hour at the tutor lab each afternoon, the quality of your homework hasn't come up in the slightest, so I took the liberty of talking to your father yesterday."
 Britney's gasp had all the dramatic effect you'd expect out of someone who'd spent the last decade of her life getting away with pretty much whatever she wanted.
 She was obviously pretending to be sorry, all the while figuring her current trouble would blow over quickly enough if she just played her cards right.
 "Your father agrees with me that your studies should be your highest priority, so you'll be staying an extra hour starting today, and ending once your performance improves.
 Of course you can always continue to just waste your study time, but if you choose to do that I've been assured that additional penalties will follow quite rapidly starting with the loss of your car."
 The next gasp was less impressive, but tangibly more genuine.
 Even my being next couldn't stop a flash of satisfaction at the way Britney was finally having to face some of the consequences of her actions.
 Mrs. Campbell dismissed her with a wave, waiting until she'd left, shutting the door with a tad more force than strictly necessary.
 "While I can't for a moment understand why you've chosen to befriend Britney, I can't fault you on your willingness to help her despite her flaws."

Johnny – I didn’t want to know that!
 Jim – And that’s why it’s so damned funny.
 Besides, you’ll need some knowledge about such things if you ever manage to talk some girl into spending time with you.
 Johnny – Well, so what if I haven’t been out with a woman yet…
 Jim – You scare them Johnny.
 In fact you make most people uncomfortable.
 It’s all the anger.
 If you keep going on the way that you have, you’ll end up dieing alone.
 Eugene – Just like my father.
 My grandmother told me that he was an angry kid.

It wasn't very nice, but I suppose everyone makes mistakes."
 Britney's eyes grew bright, even after such a short acquaintance, I knew she was about to launch into a blow-by-blow account of the last twelve or so hours.
 "Listen, I don't mean to be rude, but I've got to finish up my physics homework.
 Can we catch up during lunch?"
 Britney looked a little crestfallen, but her eyes quickly lit back up, and before I could get my notebook out and start writing, she'd already switched seats to one closer to a gaggle of cheerleaders.
 It was amazing that I hadn't made the connection between light, the fact that light acted like a wave, and the rainbows on the parking lot puddles, but it was all making sense now.
 By the time the bell finally rang to release the circus back into the halls, I'd finished up a reasonable outline, and was feeling pretty smart.
 Alec probably expected me to have been totally stumped, but I'd figured out the exact answer to the assignment, and I was so going to show him.
 The glow of satisfaction more than made up for the fact that Britney chattered non-stop on our way to Algebra.
 I felt like I should feel guilty for not liking her, but I was starting to notice how much of her conversation revolved around nasty gossip that made everyone else in the school sound like rejects or sluts.

The elf smiled, then laughed.
 They had walked right over him but not seen him.
 “Thank you, Celestia,” he said, his smile remaining even as the pain in his ribs and shoulder reawakened.
 The stinging, however, paled compared to the previous night.
 He sat up, cradling his right arm.
 A look around showed no sign of Velixar or his undead.
 The morning continued to be full of delightful surprises.
 The elf pulled out a roll of thick cloth from a knapsack and began bandaging his wounds.
 “Aurelia, we need to talk,” Dieredon said while fashioning a sling for his right arm.
 “Those half-orcs have some very interesting friends.”

You won't say anything, and it'll only be a couple of minutes.
 It's really not much, but it's hard to--" "I'm going to be in a movie!"
 She turned and threw her arms around him.
 She was in a party scene, one of six people that formed a group with the star.
 She wasn't supposed to do anything but smile and sip her drink, but when the star gave her a smoldering glance during rehearsal, the director decided he wanted to film it.
 The result was a split-second close-up of her face, and the star kissed her hand.
 Marie felt as if she were going to burst from excitement.
 They were allowed to watch filming until lunch, and then they were given a tour of the rest of the studio.
 Marie heard obscenities and shouting, and she saw two different actors storm off two different sets in the middle of their scenes.
 But it was wonderful.

I was tempted to just ignore the message, but that'd just make her testy at some point.
 It made her feel like a poor mom if we went too long without some kind of communication.
 Have to stay late for math tutoring.
 A friend will bring me home.
 --A.
 Signing my notes with an initial still felt a little like a stroke of brilliance.
 Writing out Adriana was a pain, but for obvious reasons I couldn't use the shortened version of my name.
 I glanced down at my watch and saw it was nearly time for Britney to show up.
 With a sigh I opened up the fridge and pulled out one of the trendy, meal-in-a-bottle drinks Mom had started getting lately.
 I didn't particularly like them, but it would keep until I was actually hungry, and Mom would count the bottles as a way of determining how many meals I was missing.

In addition, Chapter Five of the Commission’s report highlights direct interventions that are needed to address the problem at the level of agricultural productivity, among which the following are particularly relevant in the present context:
 Farm Productivity: The attraction of high technology service industries should not blind us to the fact that a large section of humanity still depends on agriculture as its main source of income and livelihood.
 Farm productivity in these countries is typically less than a fourth or fifth the average attained by other countries.
 Low agricultural productivity results in high cost food, low rural incomes and limited employment opportunities, both on farm and in downstream industries.
 As a revolution in agricultural productivity provided the impetus for rapid industrialization in Britain and later USA in the 19th Century, rapid modernization of agricultural technology, a shift to commercial crops, improved linkages for credit, marketing and processing can act as a catalyst for employment generation and economic growth in many developing countries today.
 As some countries have already proven, high productivity does not necessarily require large tracks of land or high levels of mechanization, but it does require quality inputs, adoption of advanced cultivation practices, efforts to improve the productivity of water, access to credit, infrastructure for storage, producer-oriented marketing and industries for processing.
 Information Empowerment: The poor quality, slow speed and inadequate reach of extension services is the bane of farming in many developing countries.
 ICT can be harnessed to provide farmers with access to state-of-the-art technical advice, quality inputs and market information.
 The proper analysis and replenishment of soil nutrients by itself can double or triple crop yields.
 Utilizing ICT, it is possible to deliver custom-tailored instructions for soil improvement in a timely manner at low cost.

They won’t be happy about it, but they cannot challenge who I bring with me.” “I would love to figure out a way to smuggle you into the room of the sigils, not likely… but something we can check out,” Rodregas added.
 “And what about Nymphs?” asked Imeralda.
 “What do you mean?” asked Rodregas.
 “If I am your sworn ‘man’ could you also bring me into the Cathedral?” she asked.
 Rodregas nodded, “Yes, I have known some Orqui and AElves who have joined the knighthood.
 I cannot think of any Hellborn or Nymphs staying there during my time.
 But that is more of a matter of the rareness of Hellborn, and Nymphs have never shown interest in joining the knighthood.” “While I am still hesitant to say that your cause is mine, I do wish to keep traveling with you two.
 I have always heard stories of the knights and would enjoy visiting the Cathedral.
 It is supposed to be a place of great magic and many myths and stories.” Rodregas nodded, he could not help smiling.
 He enjoyed the company of the two of them.

Rodregas thought that Doi’van was strangely silent.
 He guessed that the Hellborn was afraid to speak, even in a whisper.
 His voice was like granite breaking and traveled.
 “So you risk your life to save strangers?” the female squire asked.
 Her voice actually sounded curious.
 Rodregas said, “Yes, we do.
 You seem like an honorable squire, would you also like a minor Sigil of Healing?” He thought she was going to laugh at his question at first, but then she simply whispered, “That simple?” “Almost.” Rodregas said.
 “Promise to say nothing about this, and also promise that you will use your sigil wisely and that if you have a chance to help us you will do so.” “You are creating your own little Shadow Order?” she asked.
 She was referring to stories of secrete orders of knighthood that lived in the ‘shadows.’ Rodregas started to say no but then thought the idea actually had some advantages, “Welcome to the Order of…,” he paused.
 He almost said “The Celestial Lions.” But while he might be filled with the essence of a Celestial animal, he stood with a being of elemental power and one of infernal power.

She hadn't even thought about binding her chest again, a convention that her mother had never understood or liked.
 She'd always thought she was too well endowed to look good in any of the clothes she liked, but now she couldn't imagine binding it.
 Besides, she liked wearing the lacy bras she'd brought from 2011.
 "Marie," her mother said quietly, taking her daughter's arm as they left the store, "does the young man you met have anything to do with your decision to stop binding your chest?"
 "He just told me that that's not the style in--where he lives.
 He bought me clothes, and they looked and fit better without the binding."
 "Why didn't you bring any of those clothes with you?"
 "They-they aren't in style here."
 She thought of the shorts and jeans and white sundress Rick had bought her.
 She definitely wouldn't have had any use for them here.

“Very well,” Aurelia said.
 “Will you accompany me?”
 Felewen smiled at her.
 She drew her longsword and saluted.
 “But of course, Lady Thyne,” she said with none-too-subtle sarcasm.
 Aurelia tried to return a smile.
 She failed.
 “Come.
 Let’s end this now.”
 The two left the building and joined the fighting on the streets.

Harruq nodded, shivering as he felt the tip of the blade rubbing against the tender skin of his throat.
 “Good.
 Pleasant days, half-orc.
 May Celestia watch over you…‌and condemn your actions to death.”
 The biting tip left his throat, the blades in the bow retracted, and then the elf vanished.
 Harruq struggled to his feet, clutching his neck as he gasped for air.
 “Damn elf,” he cursed.
 “How dare you threaten us.”
 His hands shook violently as his adrenaline faded.
 He had been terrified, convinced the elf would kill him, yet he didn’t.

Well that’s not my life.
 My life isn’t peaceful by any standards.
 It involves lots of smart remarks and bad decisions involving life or death.
 It also involves a bad choice of a place where you roll around pretending like your life could be normal for a second.
 Yeah… Seth sat up quickly and looked around.
 He must have heard it too.
 The ground rumbled in the distance and I didn’t know if it was an earthquake or a stampede of elephants.
 “What’s going on?” I asked.
 Seth crawled back to the edge and I joined him.
 We peered over and I spotted a bunch of monsters stomping their way across the hills.

It's actually a relief to tell you.
 There are so many open secrets around here.
 It comes from living in such close quarters, from everyone being able to hear what's said anywhere in the house.
 It feels good to be able to share them with you."
 I returned his smile and tried not to focus on questions of just how much of the fluttering in my stomach was due to natural attraction for him, and how much was due to mystical heebie-jeebies.
 "For my part, I'm just glad you're telling me something for once instead of continuing to keep me in the dark."
 He released my chin and ran a finger down the side of my face.
 "Well, then I'm afraid I'll have to trade upon your current satisfaction to beg your leave.
 As much as I'd rather stay here and bask in your beauty, it's time for more training."
 I tried to keep the disappointment from my face, but his expression fell a little despite my best efforts.

He spoke candidly about how he needed to forget his old acquaintances and of starting a new life away from the influences that once nearly destroyed him.
 At the end of his speech, he held his “graduation” plaque proudly in the air to a loud applause.
 Our son was last to walk up to the front.
 As he stood up, we all held hands in anticipation of his speech.
 He looked each of us in the eyes as he fought tears.
 He apologized for the damage his addiction had caused.
 He looked at his mother and me and apologized for more than I can list.
 He repeated many of the apologies’ that he had confessed during his many candid phone calls.
 He looked at his little brother Bryce and apologized for disappointing him and endangering him.
 He said he was sorry for introducing him to pot so many years before.

He of course remained frustratingly calm, even when we hit a bump with enough force to nearly send everyone flying out of the bed.
 The other girls were trying hard to appear nonplussed.
 They were probably even fooling the boys, but they weren't enjoying themselves.
 I was nearly sick by the time the track we were following leveled out, but there was just enough light left for me to enjoy the last of the sunset as we finished up the last ten minutes of the drive.
 As the final glimmers of color faded away into twilight, Vincent pulled his truck over in a spray of dust, and we were there.
 I'd been expecting a lot of people.
 Even I knew you couldn't finish off two kegs of beer with eight or nine people, but this was crazy.
 There were already at least thirty people here, and based on the clouds of dust I could now see coming from where we'd just been, there were more people still on their way.
 Brandon nimbly jumped out of the truck bed, and then helped me down to the ground as Vincent came back and manhandled one of the kegs to the edge of the tailgate and tapped it.
 My first kegger had just officially started.

Out of the corner of my eye I saw a flash of lightning and it confused me for a moment; no storm was near.
 A vine wrapped my shoulder, jerking me back.
 I was trapped.
 I looked to Ruby, but she could not help me now.
 Beyond her, a line of long flowing robes marched through the mist… coming for us.
 The sight gave me strength, or courage, or blinding stupidity.
 I didn’t know, but I went with it with everything I had.
 I was trapped against the wall, unable to move, but there was one thing I could do.
 The sun broke through the clouds and I saw precisely what I needed.
 A shadow crossed the ground in front of us, a hawk flying overhead.

this was nothing like Davis's kisses.
 Rick's kiss was making her tremble.
 She returned it briefly and then pulled away, hiding her face against his shoulder in confusion.
 How could she like Rick's kiss more than Davis'?
 How could his kiss make her feel so hot and weak?
 Rick drew in a shaky breath, laying his cheek against her hair.
 That one small, hesitant kiss had been so exciting that he knew he'd be lost if she ever kissed him the way he wanted.
 And he knew himself well enough and was honest enough to admit that it wasn't just because she was beautiful and sexy.
 He was in love with her.
 Marie's pulse rate was almost back to normal, but her mind was still racing.

 Art – Stay in Russia and have no foreseeable future, or come to the United States and marry a stranger who just happens to turn out to be a contributor to the growth of the lesbian community.
 I wonder what would happen to the poor man if she decided to go back to Russia as a lesbian.
 Karen – I don’t know, I hope it never happens to him, my family would make his life hell if they ever found out.
 Art – A good reason to stay away from them.
 I haven’t seen much of my family in years, those people are nuts.
 They’re bizarre on the odd days as well as the even.
 That and a rift opened between us about my wife.
 I found that I preferred her company over that of my family.
 Karen – And then she left you.

Jim – Since these are your glasses it must be an inherited family curse to be so homely.
 Art – My boy, indeed it is, and if the world is lucky you won’t ever have children and pass on our cursed genes.
 Jim – What about Johnny?
 Can he still breed?
 Art – In his current mindset, I doubt that your brother will ever attract a woman willing to bear his children.
 Though he has got your mother’s looks which is a big help to that cause.
 But it’s a dark subject on which we linger.
 Have you got a hug for your old man?
 Jim – Anything to do with both Johnny or Mother can be considered a dark subject.
 (Hugs Art)  How was your trip?

Government plays a critically important role in defining and protecting property rights, ensuring competitive conditions, controlling monopolies, regulating foreign trade, establishing and enforcing quality standards, safeguarding the rights of investors and consumers, preserving the environment from over-exploitation and pollution, encouraging investment, and upholding the rights of employees to minimum wages, safe working conditions and social security in the case of lay-offs.
 The policies that have made possible the most successful recent development initiatives of nations around the world, especially in Japan and the newly industrialized nations of the Pacific Rim, do not support the argument for unregulated free market forces.
 These countries combined freedom for entrepreneurial initiative, private property and market prices with care fully crafted industrial policies and tightly controlled foreign trade and investment practices to nurture and protect nascent industries and restrict foreign investment.
 At the same time, they organized the importation of foreign technology on a massive scale.
 They utilized import tariffs, export incentives, tax relief and other mechanisms to guide development of their domestic economies.
 The reform programme involved the dismantling of most of the administrative mechanisms by which an economy can be monitored and controlled by government.
 In place of free market conditions, organized crime and corruption became rampant.
 In seeking to reject thoroughly the authoritarian form of government that suppressed the rights of the people, many of these countries allowed the power and authority of their central governments to de cline to the point where they could no longer enforce conditions needed for operation of either a command economy or a free market system.
 The power of government in the West may be veiled by the fact that its laws are usually obeyed without the need for exercise of force, but the threat of enforcement is as real for tax evaders in North America as it was for free marketers under the communist regime in USSR.
 Regardless of the system, strong government is a prerequisite for a strong economy.

Jason’s eyes flashed.
 I stood up and leaned over to him.
 “What Jason?” “Monsters, a whole bunch of them.
 I saw the movement near the pond.” He pointed to the pond that was just nestled in the woods.
 And with that, we were off.
 Running towards the pond to do what we do best, destroy monsters.
 Only this time it was different.
 Chapter 2
 We ran and ducked behind a large boulder, huddling together.
 We all sat down, closed our eyes, and concentrated.

I felt like a fool.
 They were just like the codes used in the library, only more elaborate.
 No one really used the ciphers, you didn’t need them with magic, but they had been added to many of the pages when the fairies had started tracking clan histories.
 I was holding in my hand the information I needed to find the northern clans in the Council’s library.
 My stomach tightened, but I found myself getting up and heading toward the village, regardless of the consequence.
 I argued with that impulsive part of me the entire way to town.
 I shouldn’t do it.
 I couldn’t.
 But I was.
 I was going to do it.

 Author’s hedge:  Now, friends, the following work, while incorporating much history and Memphis mythology into its olio, is, as they say, a work of fiction.
 If there are names of actual people herein, those people are not to be held responsible for the author’s prevarications, and the use of their names was done with necromancy and love.
 So, all is not what it seems and all that seems to not be what it seems may be what it seems.
 In short, the author is a confused and deeply troubled person.
 Nevertheless, this is a jape.
 Nevertheless, this is fiction fiction fiction.

My chances are so dismal they're not even worth mentioning."
 Rachel looked like she was going to argue, or say something cheerful, but the back of my mind had been trying to figure out how she could be even with us, but still sitting in the back seat.
 I did a quick check to verify my suspicion.
 "Rachel, you should be wearing your seatbelt."
 "Why?
 It isn't like anyone is going to pull us over and give us a ticket."
 It was more difficult than I expected to formulate a coherent answer while fighting off the first quivering indications of another attack.
 "She's right, Rachel.
 You should be buckled in."
 I expected her to argue with him.

A massive programme of basic vocational and skills training should be launched on a parallel with the 100 per cent literacy programmes that are now being promoted by many governments to wipe out rural illiteracy.
 The military in many developing countries possesses the organizational capabilities and experience with intensive training to assist with this task.
 An institutional gap exists in agricultural training systems.
 In most developing countries, agricultural colleges, universities and polytechnics train researchers, government, bank employees and extension officers, but not farmers.
 Producing more food with less water, less chemicals and less soil erosion requires high levels of skill.
 The chain of agricultural training needs to be filled out at the lower level by establishing thousands of village-level farm schools as proposed in the chapter on food security.
 The switch from centrally planned to market-oriented economic systems in Eastern Europe cannot be successful until the population has acquired the skills needed to function effectively in the new economic environment.
 Under the communist system, emphasis was placed on education and training in technical subjects with little attention to marketing, organizational, commercial and interpersonal skills, which are essential requirements for functioning in a market economy.
 A detailed inventory should be compiled of the types and levels of skills needed for transition to the market, covering areas such as entrepreneurship, management, national and international marketing, strategic business planning, finance, quality control, product development, production technology, design, and human resource development.
 Intensive training programmes need to be introduced to impart these skills on a massive scale.

The villagers slowed, fearfully eyeing the line.
 The stars were bright, and there was no mistaking that something was amiss.
 They were no soldiers.
 Only a scattered few wore armor.
 Still, they stood in the straight lines of a disciplined army.
 A roar from Harruq at their heels spurred them on.
 They charged the line, crying out for aid.
 “A creature attacked our town,” shouted the mother.
 “Please, my daughter is still there.
 They might hurt her.

In elven terms, I am but a child.”
 “How old a child?” he prodded.
 “Seventy.”
 “ _Seventy?_ ”
 The elf laughed.
 “Don’t be too shocked.
 You have elven blood in you as well.
 I wouldn’t be surprised if you lasted a couple hundred years yourself.
 This is assuming someone doesn’t kill you, which I find rather unlikely.”
 Harruq gasped at the thought.

Rick went to bed without having decided anything about an outfit for the dance.
 But for some reason, the young woman from the 1920s was still very much on his mind.
 CHAPTER THREE
 "I said no!"
 Marie stared at her betrothed.
 All she wanted to know was why they couldn't at least have dinner together tonight.
 He'd said he had to work, but it was Friday, and he had to eat anyway.
 But her persistence had made him lose his temper, and now she was rapidly losing hers.
 "I'm sorry having dinner with me is such a burden on you," she snapped, turning to leave.
 Davis grabbed her arm, pulling her around to face him.

But its driving force is social and psychological.
 Its prime mover is human beings.
 Becoming conscious of the process of society’s past achievements is a key to more rapid future progress.
 There needs to be a two-fold shift of our attention and emphasis from solving problems to tapping opportunities and from seeking to meet minimum needs to achieving our maximum potential.
 Preoccupation with studying problems often becomes an excuse for not dealing with them, while sapping our enthusiasm for action.
 Recognition of opportunities releases fresh energy and constructive initiative.
 Setting goals to achieve minimum needs ensures that the minimum is the most we will accomplish.
 Seeking to tap the maximum potentials challenges us to strive unceasingly for higher goals.
 The world possesses the technology, resources and organizational abilities needed to eradicate poverty from the globe.
 Positing material constraints becomes a justification for non-action.

I won that damn Grammy.
 Still the best song I’ve written, for Lor, she’s the muse.
 Maybe she really is Terpsichore.
 Maybe she is.
 CM:  	Do you have any regrets about leaving Memphis?
 BG:  	Well, I guess I knew you were gonna ask me that.
 It’s a bullshit question.
 Sorry, Creole, but, damn man.
 Regrets?
 Look at what I’ve done out here.

"I took him everyplace.
 Not because I was so naive as to let him take advantage of the fact that I had a car, but because when he was around I felt something very penetrating in the air, as though the essence of all life was with me.
 "It wasn't just us two.
 There were Eric, Margaret, Lane and me.
 Oh, what a seedy bunch of bums.
 But we were a team, and each one of us, out of loneliness perhaps, found something worth all the riches in the world.
 We found love.
 We loved each other.
 We couldn't explain our feelings to anyone else, but the four of us knew that we loved the four of us.
 When we laughed, we all laughed.

As scary as all of this was, I knew flying away and never knowing what'd happened would be worse.
 Alec was probably going to die, and all of the rest of us with him, but if he didn't, if the pack somehow managed to survive the coming crisis, I wanted to be there.
 Alec was more than capable of sending me away and then never letting me know he'd survived.
 There was a constant war inside him over what to do with me and I couldn't afford to give up my one advantage.
 He seemed less able to contemplate cutting me out of his life when I was around.
 I planned on playing that card for all it was worth.
 I was staying and that was it.
 Alec sighed, presumably in resignation, and then suddenly my legs were thrown up in front of me as he picked me up with inhuman speed.
 Only the steady pressure of Alec's arm around my waist kept me from screaming, and then I was back on my feet, and being carefully, but firmly shoved through a tangled knot of bodies.
 My shoes had never been intended to allow ankles to withstand that kind of punishment.

There's this shared past that I'm not a part of.
 It's like, oh, I don't know, I think maybe learning about the past will help me understand what's going on right now."
 Mallory's sigh seemed to allude to every one of her presumably substantial years.
 "How very perceptive.
 The past is very much driving what's happening right now, but so much of the past is tied up with the very things from which Alec's trying to protect you."
 I was bubbling with questions, but sensing that now wasn't the time to push, I sat back and waited in silence while she decided exactly how much to tell me.
 "Alec's father was killed nearly two decades ago.
 I don't remember everything about that night, I wasn't even conscious for a large part of the happenings, but the pieces I do remember are sharper than they should be.
 Sharper in my mind now maybe than even when they happened."
 Her hand gripped mine with a fragile strength that hinted at the vibrant, powerful woman she'd been back then.

It wasn’t the Seth I was friends with.
 While Emily and Jason were bickering I said, “Seth?” Seth didn’t answer.
 He acted like he didn’t hear me.
 “Seth?
 Hello earth to Seth,” I repeated.
 No answer again.
 “Seth is there something wrong?” I whispered.
 He didn’t answer me again.
 He continued to stare at the woods as if he expected a flying deer to leap out, wearing pink socks.
 “What the heck Seth, are you deaf now?” I waited for a sign that he heard me to appear on his face, but it remained blank.

For some men die by shrapnel, And some go down in flames, But most men perish inch by inch, In play at little games.
 Sylvia helped me remember to vow I wouldn’t go down that way.
 A while ago, a woman I enjoyed hanging out with accused me of being "serious."
 I don't think it was a compliment.
 I like to laugh, hear jokes and funny songs, whack golf balls back and forth across a fairway, cheer for teams and bring pleasant news wherever I can.
 But I don't understand how we can fail to get serious when people are burning, starving, weeping and hopelessly perishing, and while deep down we know we're not all we could be, or doing all we could do.
 In that, I'm like Sylvia Curtis.
 Eternity
 Philosopher and theologian Dallas Willard proposes that people who are right with God won't readily notice when they die, because they will already reside in the kingdom of heaven.
 Though I can't second his proposal with assurance, I see evidence for it, as I believe I have spent time in the kingdom of heaven.

"Thanks, Donovan.
 Not just for that either.
 I haven't properly thanked you for how nice you've been to me."
 Donovan waved away my thanks.
 "That is no more or less than my duty to a member of the family, and with that, we've arrived."
 The Graves estate was cradled between two spurs, and we'd finally traversed the length of the estate to arrive where the spurs joined the mountain.
 The north end of the valley was a terraced masterpiece that was remarkably green despite the complete lack of visible water.
 Large trees of a type I didn't recognize towered on each side, shooting up dozens of feet before branching out into an interlocking canopy that cut the harsh sunlight down to a greenish haze that swayed with the gentle motion of a breeze too slight for me to feel.
 A gravel pathway cut its winding way between real, live grass before terminating in a sandy courtyard that my eyes had been avoiding, almost as though my mind wasn't ready to deal with what it knew it would see there.
 The pack had turned at our appearance and six sets of unblinking, inhuman eyes stared up at me.

How could we all be without family?
 “Your mother…” I trailed off.
 He sighed.
 “My mother died years ago, with a large part of the northern clans.” I cringed.
 His mother had died because of my mother.
 The same as Chevelle.
 I was almost afraid to ask.
 “And your father?” He smiled.
 “My father wanders the mountain… killing fairies.” My jaw dropped.
 “You mean Ruby is your sister?” “Half-sister,” he emphasized.

It's just that you continue to surprise me."
 "It's more than a little creepy how you all can do that.
 Are all shape shifters born with the ability to read people's minds?"
 The smile was back, gentle and teasing.
 "Minds no, scents yes.
 The human body is quite marvelous in how many different systems it recruits to match its mood."
 The way Brandon had always known exactly the right thing to say at any given time suddenly made sense.
 Alec let me process his latest little tidbit of information, and then continued.
 "Actually, none of us are born with any unusual abilities.
 All of the changes tend to show up more or less around puberty.

The rage had overtaken me, though.
 The weeks of drugging Rune, sneaking out, my missing father—searching for a new wife, I was sure—all of it too much.
 I slipped.
 A small crack in my stability let out enough magic to hurt him.
 I didn’t hit him, but the surrounding trees and rocks were pulverized and I knew I had done too much.
 He stared back at me… afraid.
 I turned and ran without another word.
 Straight back to the castle.
 In these few short weeks I had started to think of it less as a home and more as a prison.
 My limited freedom made me ache for more.

He'll do another show in a couple of hours."
 "How do they do that?"
 "The jacket is made out of some kind of special material."
 That was the most amazing stunt she saw that day, but there were dozens of special effects and props that filled her with wonder.
 They took a tour of the movie lot, and Marie was excited to see the sets of some of the movies Rick had rented for her.
 The tram they rode crossed a bridge that shook as if it would collapse, and she screamed, clutching Rick's arm.
 A giant shark swam up to the tram as it crossed a river, and as they later emerged from a forest, it began raining, and a flood rushed toward them.
 With so many children on the tram, Marie knew that these "disasters" were just tricks, but she was still glad she could huddle in Rick's arms when the tram seemed to be in danger.
 "You're not afraid of heights, are you, sweetheart?"
 Rick asked as they stood in line to ride the "E.T."

The bath towel was big and fluffy and felt wonderful against her skin.
 She looked askance at the night shirt, however.
 She'd never worn such a thing.
 When she put it on, she found that it fit her like a tent.
 But oddly enough, she liked it.
 The big bathrobe almost reached her ankles, and she felt quite comfortable as she picked up her dress and wet clothing and went across the hall to the bedroom.
 She found hangers in the closet and hung her clothes there.
 But once she was in bed, the dreamlike feeling dissolved.
 She was far, far away from home, in a strange place, and she didn't know if she'd ever get back.
 Tears trickled down her cheeks as she drew her knees up under the covers, her back against the headboard.

I laughed as I realized my mind placed Fannie there.
 Ruby didn’t look like she could think of anything funny about what she’d said, but she continued.
 “Secondly, don’t cut yourself.
 These things are sharp.” She moved to toss the sword to me but reconsidered and handed it over, making sure I had a good grip.
 There were intricate designs carved on the handle and runes etched in the blade.
 It wasn’t as heavy as it appeared.
 I moved it around a bit, slashing wide arcs though the chill air.
 It was pleasant, nicely balanced in my hand.
 That didn’t mean I could actually cut through someone’s neck, though.
 “Ruby, how do you intend to teach me with this?

I am instructed to park my truck’s front end against a fence that borders the parking lot facing the greenbelt.
 I am shown new surveillance photos of the two suspects and their vehicle: a red Dodge Charger with tinted windows.
 The code word which I am to use in a sentence to confirm the exchange of money for drugs has been changed to “Reno” and I see a pattern so I assume that if the deal does not go down this time, my next code word may be “Vegas.” I pray there isn’t a next time.
 Chapter 20: Going Down Finally a red Dodge Charger is driving slowly over the entrance bridge.
 I say, “Red Dodge Charger approaching at one o’clock,” attempting not to move my lips, as the vehicle is coming almost directly towards me on my right.
 The Dodge slows almost to a stop just a couple of car lengths away.
 I am unable to see in the tinted windows of the car but I am certain they can see me; I stare back as if to say, “Is that you?” They are obviously aware that I am there, alone and awaiting their arrival.
 The car slowly pulls away after taking a good look at me.
 I lose sight of them, as they seem to be going towards the opposite end of the parking lot.
 I assume they will pull around after checking out the surroundings but instead my crack-berry rings within seconds.

CM: 	Ah—
 BG: 	But, he ain’t Verlaine, he ain’t Baudelaire.
 But he’s got some great rock pipes.
 And his lyrics are—well, interesting.
 They’re singable.
 That’s the end of it.
 CM: 	Dylan?
 BG: 	The question always comes back to Bob, doesn’t it?
 Dylan is Dylan, immutable, untouchable.
 But, I think, if you asked him if he was T. S. Eliot, he would only laugh.

Economic collapse in Eastern Europe: The enormous spread and depth of economic decline among the former communist countries of Eastern Europe during the period 1990–3 exceeds in magnitude the catastrophe that engulfed the capitalist economies during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
 Falling production and incomes coupled with soaring prices are combining to cause political instability, social unrest and extreme hardship to the populations of these nations.
 If not remedied, this could result in a reversal of the remarkable progress towards world peace achieved during the past seven years.
 Arms exports: The cutting of defence budgets has generated increasing pressure on arms manufacturers to seek export markets.
 Although the value (in 1992 US dollars) of arms exports fell by more than 50 per cent from 1988 to 1992, it still represents nearly $20 billion annually.
 These weapons, over 80 per cent of which are supplied by the five permanent members of the Security Council, directly contribute to the growing instability and violence.
 During the last decade, 40 per cent of these weapons were sold to trouble spots such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.
 These are, indeed, severe challenges that call for urgent and determined action by the global community on a scale unprecedented during times of peace.
 But the lessons of the past decade should caution us against accepting as a fait accompli statistical projections that predict the outcome of our effort over the next ten years before it has even begun.
 No such determinism exists, except in our minds.

Britney looked particularly unhappy.
 Mrs. Campbell was looking at my homework when I reached her desk.
 "I was prepared to tear into you for not going to the tutoring lab last night, but that hardly seems fair seeing as how you went ahead and did the work by yourself."
 I felt a small glow of satisfaction flare into life, but her next words ensured it didn't get out of hand.
 "Of course, you've got the right answers, and technically you're attacking the problems correctly, but you're leaving out a couple of steps that I think will give you problems a bit later on.
 Please take my advice and spend a little bit of time at the math lab.
 Even if you can't make it every day, you need to come in a few times a week."
 "Yes, ma'am."
 The scolding actually hadn't been that bad, almost like disguised praise.
 Britney looked like she was hoping for something similar, but Mrs. Campbell's expression quickly dashed that idea.

Marie didn't relax until everyone had tasted the lasagna that evening.
 It was good, and she smiled when Rick winked at her over his second forkful.
 "Do you cook a lot?"
 Teri asked Marie.
 "Not a lot.
 Four or five times a week."
 "I'd call that a lot.
 I usually cook twice a week and have takeout the rest of the time."
 "Oops."
 Everyone looked at Rick, who was using his napkin to dab at a spot on his shirt.

She clutched at his shoulders, her breath coming faster.
 "Yeah."
 He wove his fingers into her hair and began pressing kisses along her neck.
 "You were the perfect hostess.
 And you looked so incredibly beautiful."
 "I-I'm sure that thought didn't-didn't cross Teri's mind."
 She arched her neck, her heart racing wildly.
 "It crossed mine more than once."
 He raised his head to look into her eyes.
 "I love you, Marie."

 "Jasmin just left."

 "Alec, she'll probably be okay.

“Fine.
 When?”
 “Tomorrow,” Aurelia said.
 “Early morning.”
 Harruq nodded, his whole body fidgeting.
 Now that he’d found her he wanted nothing more than to escape.
 He was supposed to thank her and go, not be mocked and ordered around.
 “Go on home,” Aurelia said.
 “I’ll be waiting for you.”
 He did as commanded, and that fact disturbed him greatly.

"Oh, Rick, that's not true!"
 she cried, afraid she'd hurt him.
 She laid her hands on his chest, leaning into him as she looked up at him.
 "I really did want to kiss you.
 I couldn't have gotten that look on my face if I hadn't wanted to kiss you."
 He drew her closer.
 "Prove it."
 "How?"
 "Kiss me."
 She blushed, but after a moment, she stood on tiptoe and raised her face to press her lips against his.

The type of work given may be varied depending on both the qualifications and the training needs of the individual – for example, as assistants in child education, or care for children and the elderly, or environmental protection.
 If properly administered, these programme have proved successful in reducing costs, imparting new skills and identifying false welfare claims.
 Redirect welfare expenses for creating jobs, rather than encouraging idleness, by paying welfare recipients to carry out public service activities in return for welfare payments.
 This requires the identification of employment-intensive programmes that provide clear benefit to the community without interfering with existing business, such as the US Civilian Conservation Corps that built the US National Parks system in the 1930s.
 Expanding or upgrading the educational system would be a priority area.
 16.Make income distribution more equitable: The number of jobs available is directly related to patterns of income distribution.
 In Japan and other dynamic Asian economies, the ratio between the bottom and top pay is as much as 5 or 10 times lower than in the United States.
 A highly skewed income distribution results in lower levels of overall demand, growth and job creation.
 Lopsided income distribution fuels speculative investment, more and more of which goes overseas.
 The average wages for production workers in the United States are the lowest they have been since 1967, with 18 per cent of full-time workers not earning enough to keep a family of four out of poverty, up from 12 per cent in 1979.

 Slowly everyone else trickles in, starting with Art and Karen.
 Art – (Shouts) Jim where are you?
 Jim – (Sits up) Right here, where I’ve been for the last twenty minutes.
 Art – Why haven’t you been helping out?
 Jim – Um, because there were already a bunch of people.
 And you didn’t need any more to get in the way.
 Besides, I wanted to catch up with Sumo here.

Their faces disappeared as I was swallowed by the trees.
 I skidded to a halt and scanned the trees.
 I didn’t see any trace of where Seth could have ran.
 That shows how much I know about asking questions.
 I don’t get the answers and boom; I lose it and become a demanding person.
 I walked more slowly, watching the trees.
 I sent a silent prayer that Seth hadn’t entered Igneeria, because then I would never find him.
 What bugged me the most was that Seth didn’t fight me when I pushed him down.
 He just sat on the ground not saying anything at all in his own defense.
 Now, I couldn’t find him anywhere and I would never get my answer.

Rodregas knew from the guard’s fear that he had him, he was not thinking clearly.
 Rodregas growled at him, letting him feel his anger and rage at taking slaves to be used by the Immortalists.
 Rodregas had seen what would happen to them.
 He had suffered for years with a subtle kind of inner rot at letting the evil continue.
 In all the ways that mattered Rodregas knew he was no better than this man, he had spent most of his life as a slaver.
 Rodregas had no moral grounds on which to kill these men, but inside of him there was no mercy.
 He had crossed a line and could no longer live with the evil.
 Rodregas let go of the guard’s shield.
 He did not have the angle to grab his opponent’s throat.
 Instead he had to grab the man’s lower face which was exposed by the half helm, and then he squeezed.

The staff moved faster and with more control that one could follow.
 Doi’van finished the exhibition with the staff swinging over his shoulder and with a savage swing downward, ending with perfect control where it would have connected with a fallen opponent.
 Rodregas almost pointed out that he was doing Kata, practicing against an opponent only seen in your mind, but decided that this was the time for him to learn and Doi’van to teach.
 Rodregas had long ago learned that it was hard to learn if you were talking.
 Over the next hour Rodregas began to regret his decision to learn.
 Doi’van was clearly a master with the staff which Rodregas could not help but be impressed by.
 In the Eastern Realms, and every other kingdom that he knew of, the staff was a peasant weapon.
 As many lords only allowed swords to be for their soldiers and nobility.
 Farmers and crafts people were not allowed to own edged weapons of war.
 Though Rodregas had known such rules to be broken by non-noble families, it was done discretely, usually for keeping a family heirloom.

"Could we go there sometime?
 You and I?"
 He smiled down at her.
 "An island cruise would be much nicer, I'm sure.
 In fact, I think it would make a lovely honeymoon trip."
 If her heart did one more somersault today, it was going to fall right into her stomach.
 Marie and Davis spent the next day with her family, and he promised to take her out for dinner and dancing again next Saturday.
 She suspected that he might propose soon.
 "What do you think about a September wedding, Mother?"
 Marie asked as they had lunch alone together Friday.

 Romance isn't everything, Marie, and if that's all you have, it doesn't even last very long.
 You need to enjoy everything together, going to-to speakeasies, going for walks, playing games, or just being together while you read.
 You've said he doesn't spend much time with you because he works so much.
 That's ridiculous.
 If he loved you, he'd make time for you.

Economists studying the results of economic variables tend to overlook the influence of factors from other fields on the assumption that non-economic factors are constant.
 Under relatively stable and static conditions, these economics principles can be employed to predict changes in economic variables to a considerable extent.
 But under circumstances in which underlying economic, social and political conditions are undergoing radical change, the relevance and predictive capacity of purely economic concepts is quite limited.
 This was the situation confronting the states of the region at the beginning of the transition period, and the reason why the actual results of the reform differed so drastically from what had been anticipated.
 The situation in Eastern and Central Europe was further complicated by the disproportionately large size and importance of the defence sector in the economy.
 This necessitates, not only a change from one economic system to another, but also a restructuring of the entire economy from a defence orientation to a consumer orientation.
 This change in structure could not be brought about by reliance on macro-economic policy.
 2.Political and social consensus is essential for rapid social change: In a democratic society, the market cannot be instituted by decrees or authoritarian methods which belong to the old sys tem.
 In the new political climate, reforms will be successful only in the measure that they are understood and accepted by the population.
 The vitality of the market depends on releasing the initiative of people to act in their own perceived best interests by producing and distributing goods and services for consumption by others.

Per capita food production has actually declined in more than half of all developing countries over the past 15 years.
 In 18 countries with high rates of population growth, primarily in Africa, it has been deteriorating for the past three decades.
 While the Near East, North Africa, East Asia and Latin America/Caribbean regions are expected to achieve average food supplies of 3,000 calories per day by 2010, 200 million people will still be malnourished in South Asia and 300 million, or one-third of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, will suffer from severe food deficits.
 Due to rapidly expanding population, agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa would have to grow at four per cent annually in order significantly to improve per capita availability of food.
 Thus far, only East Asia has sustained such high growth rates in agriculture, averaging 6.1 per cent from 1970 to 1990.
 This trend, if not halted and reversed, casts a renewed spell of gloom over the hopes of hundreds of millions of people to escape from hunger, and over all our hopes for peace in the twenty-first century.
 The projection of future prospects based on past trends is especially questionable with regard to food.
 Not even some of the most prominent agricultural economists expected the gains in food production which have occurred in the past several decades.
 An international team of experts visiting India in 1963 projected a mere 10 per cent growth in foodgrain production by 1970, whereas growth actually achieved during this period was 50 per cent.
 Neither technological, nor financial nor natural resources pose insurmountable obstacles to achieving dramatically more over the next 15 years than is indicated by past trends or current projections.

"So this isn't normal?"
 Dom shook her head again.
 "No, in most packs, any confrontation ends in violence.
 Generally there are a whole host of dominants who want to become the alpha.
 This would usually turn into a real dominance fight, with the other two doing their very best to kill him before turning on each other to fight over the spoils."
 "That's terrible."
 Her nod was sad.
 "I told you he was special.
 All of that hard-won civilization tends to flake and chip away when we're that close to our beast.
 Alec always does what's right though.

 Toad dwarf said to Emily, “Kill all you like but Kojas will rise.
 Is Kojas the person they’ve been talking about?
 Who is he?
 Toad dwarf said to Jazell, “The one will rise, the one will rise!
 He will destroy you!” Is Kojas’ rising?
 Toad dwarf said to Jason, “The King will rise.” She placed her notes in the middle so we could read it.
 “What does this all mean?” I asked her.
 She was silent, “I guess the person they’re talking about is Kojas, but we don’t know who he is, or if he’s important.” “Well, I’m thinking he’s important because these weird dwarfs keep talking about him.

So he changed his mind and walked the course, and landed in the hospital.
 One evening Eric gave me a sweater and a stack of records.
 Thelonius Monk.
 Dave Brubeck with Gerry Mulligan.
 Lena Horne.
 Harry Belafonte singing blues.
 Though it might take him months to graduate, he said he was anxious to clean things out, to get prepared, ready to move.
 On the evening of Valentine’s Day, 1963, I stopped by his house and he showed me a sack half full of small candy hearts, with slogans like, “I love you” and “Hey, sweetheart.” He picked out a half dozen that asked, “Why not?” and gave me the rest of the bag, along with instructions for tomorrow at school.
 He said, “Give one to every girl who looks like she didn’t get a valentine.” I passed some around, though not half as many as Eric would have done.
 That was Friday.

The veteran was clearly taking him seriously, going in slowly with his knees bent and his feet keeping active.
 Rodregas would have no skill advantage here.
 Rodregas was hesitant to bash his sword too much, as it was of average quality.
 While the sword should be fine for his first match, he hoped to be fighting all day today.
 He went forward leading with his round shield.
 He pushed his combatant back with some hard swings.
 Rodregas swung his shield aggressively, he hit the man’s sword with his shield and then banged the other man’s shield hard.
 Rodregas’ goal was to see if he could out muscle the man while staying protected by the shield.
 It worked!
 Clearly his opponent, though set for a heavy blow, was not expecting the strength of Rodregas’ bash.

Rodregas could feel the wetness of blood on his toes and he felt like he was going to slip at any moment.
 He breathed deep and yelled, “I am climbing the damn ‘One Tree,’ what does it look like?
 Now, shut up before I fall.”  He continued his climb, finally reaching a branch.
 The branch was on such a scale that he had to climb the branch coming up its side.
 The bark of the branch was smoother and offered less of a grip.
 Finally he got to the top, which was broad and actually rather cup-like against the main trunk.
 Though he worried about Imeralda, he let himself rest for a moment to recover.
 After a few minutes Rodregas got up and looked around for Imeralda.
 He saw that she was actually far out on another impossibly think branch.
 By the Infernals he swore to himself.

Listen to these words very carefully.
 If you give it enough of your power, nary a soul can withstand the shock and blood loss.”
 The man in black listed off a stream of seven words.
 Seven times he pronounced them, giving his disciple ample chances to hear the precise, delicate pronunciations and mimic them himself.
 “Prepare the spell with these words in the morning and you may trigger it at any time with but a single word.”
 “And what is that?” Qurrah asked once the words were tucked firmly into his mind.
 “Hemorrhage,” Velixar hissed.
 The frail half-orc smiled, loving the sound.
 Harruq sat nearby.
 The spidery, intangible lessons in spellcasting had little to do with him, but he politely remained silent and respected their usefulness

 It’s all I could ever offer him, and it was never enough, your mother saw to that.

 The entire world, even God.
 It’s no real wonder why he’s so damn angry with us all.
 I just hope we can reach to him before he decides to get revenge on life for the lot he has been cast.
 I don’t know how I would try to reach him in your place.
 Just try.

Now I need to spend the rest of my life scouring my soul clean of the taint that you have put on it.
 I hate you for what you are.
 I hate you for what you’ve done to me.
 You are all dead to me.
 Jim – Johnny.
 Johnny – She didn’t even sign it.
 How do you get on with your life after that?
 Jim – You need to find something else.
 Dad had the business to keep him occupied.
 Johnny – Yeah I know, he spent fifty or sixty hours a week there after mom left.

Let’s make camp in here.
 In the morning we can start seeing about getting this farm in order.” With that they all worked together to get the barn organized and clean.
 There was no more talking, each had plenty of their own thoughts to mull over.
 Rodregas was feeling pretty good at the moment, dangerously positive.
 He had learned long ago that the better you felt, the harder came the emotional fall.
 He knew this was all too good to last, but knowing that it would not last also made it more important that he enjoy the moment.
 Rodregas was free.
 He was being hunted; but hunted because he had finally dealt out justice.
 He had killed two monsters, two who wore faces not their own, and who he could feel no remorse for killing.
 Rodregas had finally escaped to his quiet place in the mountains to rest and, best of all, with two companions who seemed to be good people.

A few minutes later, Bryce rounded the corner into the room with his arms outstretched cupping the Oxy and foil he found inside CD cases.
 I had never even thought to check there.
 Brandon stood up.
 Bryce glared into Brandon’s eyes, and in the room’s dead silence Bryce laid the drugs and the burned black-sketched foil on the counter like it was a dead animal.
 I stood in front of Brandon, looking slightly up at him, as he is taller than me.
 The room was silent and everyone awestruck.
 After what we just went through with him… I looked Brandon in his guilty darkened eyes and I said, “Prepare yourself to find out what will happen to you every time you lie to me… are you ready?” Before he could reply or even contemplate my words, I felt the crack of Brandon’s nose on my knuckles and he flew backwards off his feet.
 My family’s loud simultaneous gasps accompanied Harry and Bryce’s rush to restrain me as if I was going to continue the beating.
 Maybe kill Brandon.
 This is how angry we all were.

That last fact should have alarmed me more than it did.
 Somehow being stripped down by a stranger paled in comparison to a near-death hallucination involving wolves and a monster straight out of a science fiction movie.
 The bedroom was possibly the nicest room I'd ever been in.
 A movie star or millionaire would have had a hard time topping this place for sheer decadence.
 The walls were paneled in some kind of rare, doubtless expensive imported hardwood.
 The bookcases that covered the majority of the wall space seemed to be made out of the same kind of wood, and were filled with more books than I'd seen in the local bookstore the one time I'd convinced Britney to stop by on our way home after school.
 They were all hardbound, with leather bindings and engraved covers.
 There was a stereo system off in one corner, hooked up to a laptop and some kind of portable music player.
 I had to look around the room twice before I finally spotted the speakers to the system.
 They were built into the walls and ceiling, and based on their number and varying sizes I had a sneaking suspicion they'd produce nearly as much volume as the monsters professional DJs brought to dances.

Due to his status as a senior sergeant, he knew where the key was kept.
 Once the door was open, he stepped inside.
 Immediately, his eyes went to a long side bench where several new pieces of armor were piled up.
 These would be some of the more recent pieces not yet sorted or sold off for not being of use to the guard.
 Captain Poir had a tendency to leave some of the better equipment there for long periods, just in case they might prove useful at a later date.
 Most of the armor was average civilian crap, but he quickly found several large pieces of leather scale armor that were his size.
 From the good fit he surmised that it had been the property of the original owner of his new body.
 The armor was braided leather with steel scales attached; he quickly tried it on and found it to be a perfect fit.
 It was probably custom made and was solid, if unspectacular, quality armor.
 The braided, lacquered leather reinforced with the steel scales provided decent protection for most fights.

Several factors are responsible for this result, among which population growth and technological development are most prominent.
 Rising levels of technological sophistication certainly displace workers in most fields of manufacturing.
 But at the same time they stimulate growth of employment in many different ways – increasing demand for the products thus manufactured by a factor of 10, 100 or even 1000 fold as in the case of automobiles, TVs, cell phones and computers; increasing the demand for research workers to support technological innovation and for teachers to meet the rising demand for education; and rising living standards, which increases consumption of other goods and services due to the falling prices made possible by rising productivity.
 Over the past two decades the US economy lost nearly 4 million manufacturing jobs but added a net 37 million jobs through expansion of the service sector, which now accounts for 84 per cent of total employment.
 It is time that we stop resisting or resenting this trend, but rather strive to adapt by shifting our focus toward those fields of employment which are most directly stimulated by technological innovation.
 Export of commercial services already accounts for 20 per cent of world trade.
 The shift from manufacturing to services is a positive and inevitable expression of the elevation of human activity from the physical to the mental level, which is the central reason for the phenomenal rise in global living standards over the past century.
 Rich nations have become rich through a shift of workers from the primary farm sector to value-added, non-farm secondary and tertiary sectors.
 Poverty and hunger persist so long as a majority of the population depend upon the routine operations of farming for their livelihood.
 This is also the cause of the growing feminization of poverty in developing countries.

“And now half-ling,” it whispered with joy, “you die.” It lunged up at me.
 I had a sudden feeling inside and I stabbed at the creature.
 It tried to change forms to avoid the knife's path but somehow my knife stabbed it anyway.
 It withered and then went still.
 I gasped as the body fell to the ground and even some of the creatures, around stopped.
 They murmured among each other, “She killed a syphon!
 She killed one of us.” So the awful creatures were called syphons?
 What did they want?
 I made a mental note to tell Emily about this.
 That is, if all of us didn’t die first.

Over some months, through prayer and meditation, she came to believe that evil itself had invaded the world and entered people, and God had allowed this to happen, which led her to a certainty that we are now living in the world’s final days.
 Powered by these revelations, she prayed with intensity and perseverance.
 And God responded by urging her to give herself entirely to him.
 She assured him she was all his.
 For some weeks, he allowed her to rest on that answer, but more and more she became uneasy with it, until she realized she didn’t by any means belong entirely to God.
 Most of her thoughts, concerns and energies went to her family.
 She was the mom of three wonderful kids and the wife of a loving husband.
 In horror, she returned to intense and persistent prayer, telling God he couldn’t possibly mean she should leave her family, could he?
 Rather than reply with words, he used silence, like Tae Kwon Do Master Jeong used to do when one of us students offered an excuse for not training often enough.
 For weeks she waited, listened, and prayed God would at last reply that he had only been using the method through which he tested Abraham’s willingness to obey at any cost.

“But I have fought the founders of the Council of Mages.
 I have killed men who thought themselves gods.
 I have died but once, to Ashhur himself.
 There is no shame in your defeat.”
 Aurelia struggled to her feet.
 The well of magic inside her was dry.
 In time, her strength would return, but she doubted the necromancer would give her a day to rest.
 She used a bit of the magic she did have left to summon her staff.
 If she were to die, she would die fighting any way she knew how.
 The man in black paused, extended his hands, and began to cast.

“None of us is simple,” continued the Hellborn.
 “The two of us have become friends, even though I am a Hellborn.
 In me flows the blood of the Daemons of the Infernal.” He paused and then his voice cracked, showing a trace of a deep emotion for the first time “Yet, you treat me like a man.
 You must do the same for Imeralda, for you two to be lovers you must learn to share her with others.
 She has a lot of love to give.
 Do not be so selfish as to want it all to yourself.” With that he gave a punch to Rodregas’ side, causing Rodregas to grunt in pain, and Doi’van followed the other two out the door.
 Rodregas laid in the bed, his mind whirling with thoughts.
 At first he thought about the implications of what Jordaan had shared.
 But, then his mind went back again and again over his and Imeralda’s time during the last few weeks and then back to Doi’van’s words.
 He knew his friend spoke the truth, but he was not so sure about his ability to do what he needed to keep his relationship with the beautiful AElven Nymph.

“Get lost,” Harruq growled.
 The man obliged, taking his bottle of ale and running.
 That taken care of, the half-orc went around back where he found a few worn and uneven crates.
 He lifted one and approved of its strength after a simple test.
 Satisfied, he went back around and placed it against the wall.
 He was about to go back for a second when torchlight flooded the alley.
 “Move and you’ll find an arrow in your throat,” said a voice.
 “Pincushion him anyway,” urged another.
 Harruq held a hand before his eyes, cursing his awful luck.
 He saw two figures, night patrolmen, and both human.

 Explain that.
 BG:  	Well, yeah, I can make my guitar speak, it’s secondary if I can sing lyrics or write lyrics, you know.
 My guitar does a lot of talking.
 Like Zappa’s “My Guitar Wants to Kill Your Mama.”  (laughs)  But, sure, I’ve made it talk, talk for me, if you want that spin on it.
 CM:  	Like on what songs?

Qurrah watched the blue portal close, leaving him alone and hunted in a town full of enemies.
 “Brother, how could you?” he asked, dread clutching his throat.
 Elves were running down the alley, yelling in their language.
 Qurrah ducked back around, cursed his brother, and then darted to the nearest home.
 The first one had locks, as did the second, but the third was unbarred.
 He hid inside as the shouts of search parties went rushing past.
 Qurrah climbed the stairs to the second floor, sat down beside a bed, and then in silence pondered his fate now that he was alone.

His heart was troubled and he had not a soul to tell why.
 He held a proclamation of King Vaelor to the entire nation of Neldar.
 He had argued as best he could, but his words meant little.
 When Antonil asked that someone else deliver the proclamation, a frown had crossed the king’s smooth face and he had slammed his lotioned hand against a table.
 “It will mean more coming from you!” the king had shouted.
 “They will know the seriousness of my order.
 I will not be flooded with spies, treated like a mere peasant, and then insulted by such blatant snubbing of my humble call for aid.
 Let them know I am king, my dear Antonil.
 Make sure they know.”
 Antonil halted at the center of Veldaren where the four main roads of the city interconnected and a large marble fountain towered over all.

The gesture belonged with perfect times, not ones in which people other than me were having nervous breakdowns.
 Then again, a bad night with Alec still somehow managed to beat most other good nights.
 "Everything was almost perfect.
 If there was anything less than ideal, it wasn't your fault."
 "Still, I'd like to make it up to you."
 He looked down at my ankle and then smiled with a hint of mischievousness.
 "I suppose dancing is out, but I think I've got something that'll do just about as well."
 Alec carefully picked me up before I could respond.
 A few seconds later we were outside, traveling through the darkness with a breakneck speed that would've been suicidal with merely human vision.
 I was completely lost by the time we came around a corner and my inferior eyes were finally able to see the first hints of light up ahead.

No.
 He didn’t influence me.
 I loved the cat, man.
 That’s enough isn’t it?
 I mean I learned from him, he learned from me, I’m still learning from Lor, you know, that’s the world, man.
 If you ain’t learning you’re dead.
 So, I’m still trying to absorb some things, follow some things that I thought of maybe back then and Jimi was there, he was undeniably there, like the monolith from 2001, you know?
 So, there were a lot of us cats playing the guitar, and…uh, I’ve lost the thread of what I was saying.
 CM:  	What about Dylan?
 BG: 	I have confused recollections of my first awareness of Bob Dylan.

“Spread about, and do not halt your movement for all eternity.”
 The two thousand obeyed, scattering in a constantly moving jumble of arms and legs.
 “That should help keep our presence hidden for a time,” Qurrah said.
 “They are but distractions.
 The darkness will hide us from their arrows.”
 Before Qurrah could ask what Velixar meant, his master was already in the midst of another spell.
 Inky darkness rose all about his feet, swirling like black floodwaters.
 Chills crept up his ankles as the liquid darkness grew.
 Velixar cried out the final words of the spell, spreading the darkness for a mile in all directions, so high it covered up to their necks.
 “It is cold,” Qurrah said, his teeth chattering.

Liz – What’s he done that is worse than this?
 And what did he mean when he said ‘you’re good at this sort of thing.’
 Jim – He didn’t mean anything by it.
 Liz – He meant something by it, otherwise he wouldn’t have said anything.
 Now what did you do?
 Jim – you know Gene, he says thing all the time.
 He was just being Gene.
 Liz – What did you do?
 You didn’t give him the idea to tell the anorexics that they were fat did you?

Evenings she would withdraw to her room and lie with a cool cloth on her forehead, listening to the Lakers, the Padres, or Dodgers, or to whomever the playoffs featured.
 Even through the World Series, she hardly watched an inning on television.
 She preferred the dark and her radio.
 That year, the Yankees won in five games.
 The following week my mom stayed home from her job, teaching eighth-grade English.
 Her headache was so wicked, she grimaced and groaned.
 I tried to coax her to the doctor.
 She said he had already given her pain pills, which was all he could do.
 Then I came home from school and found her lying in a heap beside her bed.
 Breathing in shallow puffs, eyes open and watery.

"You didn't miss anything," Rick told Marie, setting the article aside.
 "Scientists think that it would be possible to travel through time by going through these wormholes the author mentions, but it's all theory.
 Nobody has ever discovered a wormhole, and none of this stuff has ever been proven."
 Marie sighed.
 "This book isn't hard to follow, but I'm rather skeptical.
 The author says that thought is the way to travel through time.
 He says that if you concentrate hard enough on getting to the time you want to visit, you can do it."
 "Yeah, I found some ideas about that in the other books I read.
 Maybe--" "But that doesn't explain how I came here.
 I wasn't thinking about 2011."

I turned and limped off, wishing my ankle was in better shape so I could properly stomp.
 Spanish arrived much too soon.
 Since I hadn't gotten in trouble wandering the halls so far, it was a definite temptation to skip the last hour of school too.
 Unfortunately my luck was bound to give out sooner or later, and then I'd be in even more trouble.
 The last thing I needed was a record of delinquency to go along with my failing grade in Biology.
 Mrs. Tiggs was positively glowing as we all walked into her classroom.
 She popped out of her chair as soon as the bell rang, and began handing out graded tests.
 My world started trembling as I turned my test over and saw an 'F' at the top of the page.
 'Come see me after class.'
 The note felt like the final nail in the coffin of my academic future.

 A FAIL!
 “Nice try,” Seth whispered and I think he really meant it.
 Or maybe he was teasing me.
 It’s hard to tell in these situations.
 Seth brandished his sword.
 “My turn.” “Really, warrior?” Kojas said and laughed.
 His laugh was like a bunch of spiders running down my back.
 “You think your sword will do any more than the pathetic archer girl’s arrow?” “Hey,” I shouted, “I’m not a pathetic archer girl!” Oh course, the two ignored me.
 I swear the air sizzled with the tension between Kojas and Seth.

“Oh, don’t misjudge my words.
 I did not mean to imply any misdeeds of our valiant Knights of the Soaring Heavens.
 I am not aware of any of them doing much of anything, much less kill an Immortalist.” “Than what should I keep my eye out for?” asked Van’dret.
 He was becoming even more curious to the direction of the conversation.
 “You, my fine Van’dret, are more in the world than most of us.
 You are out traveling and adventuring, while most of us Immortalist just sit in our towers.
 I have always thought that our one weakness was our isolation.
 It is hard to know what is exactly happening when we are not out to see it.”  For a moment, Taiga paused, looking up at the crystal roof overhead in apparent contemplation of the possible implications of their isolated natures.
 After a moment, in which Van’dret waited patiently, Taiga continued, “You are one of our best, and yet you are also in the world.
 The tournament draws the powerful and those who wish to be powerful.

 Do you mind if I give you a ride home on Tuesdays and Thursdays?"
 Did I mind?
 Of course not.
 "That would be really great.
 Thanks for offering."
 Brandon ran one finger down the side of my face, and then leaned back with a smile as I reached for the door.
 It wasn't until I was out of the car that I realized our Jeep was parked in its normal spot off to the side of the house.
 Excited to talk to Mom about her last outing, I waved goodbye to Brandon and hurried to the door.
 Mom hardly even looked up from her laptop as I walked in.

"I'm sorry you can't have both, darling.
 But I'm so glad to have you home again."
 Marie went to her room to change clothes and lie down.
 What an emotion-packed day.
 She'd been reunited with her family, learned that her father and brother had reconciled, broken up with Davis, and spent an entire weekday morning with her father.
 She smiled as she reached into her closet for a housedress.
 She would have sworn that her father was more like Davis than like Rick, but she was pleased to realize that he really was more like Rick.
 He'd stayed home from work to be with her, and he'd held her.
 And he hadn't been upset that she'd broken up with Davis.
 He just wanted her to be happy.

The only prisoners in the keep’s dungeon were beings that were held for potential use in the ceremony.
 That meant they were of great power or talent.
 The prisoners were too dangerous to release, after Ravenhurr had so pissed them off by their imprisonment.
 But people did not question the order of the sorcerer and master of Raven Keep, so it should work.
 He dared not stay longer than he had to; Rodregas did not believe that he could fool Ravenhurr’s guards and servants for long.
 Ravenhurr was a powerful sorcerer who used magic quite casually; it would become quite obvious that Rodregas did not know how to use magic anywhere near Ravenhurr’s level.
 As soon as the keep emptied out for the birthday celebration he would make his escape.
 If he missed this opportunity he was not sure when he could try again.
 It was very rare for an Immortalist to leave his tower, and if he were behaving oddly, the guild would send someone to check on him soon.
 They were careful in their control of the kingdom.

"You don't need to do that; I can always just ride the bus."
 Brandon flipped open the passenger door and motioned for me to get in.
 I started around the vehicle, stumbling and nearly falling before I finally made it to my destination.
 Brandon waited for me to get my seatbelt on and then gunned the engine, flipping around a hundred and eighty degrees in a maneuver I'd never seen anyone perform outside of the movies.
 "Of course I don't have to pick you up.
 It's more a matter of wanting to, if I can say that without making things all weird.
 I have obligations at school, people who depend on me.
 I can't spend the time I'd like getting to know you there, so it just made sense to free up some time in the mornings to make that happen."
 Everything was just too unreal.
 I couldn't believe it was all happening, so I chose to ignore the implications of what he was saying.

I was halfway to the closest door before I remembered that it was still closed as a result of the mysterious 'potato gun rampage' as everyone had started calling it.
 A normal person, one who was really as self-confident as I pretended to be, would have just turned and headed towards the eastern set of doors.
 Not wanting to look like a ditzy blonde who couldn't even remember that someone had run a SUV into the flagpole and temporarily rendered one of the four main exits inoperable, I kept walking.
 The school was narrower than it was long.
 I could walk around the west end, and use the closest doors on the north side, and still have plenty of time to get to my locker before Biology started.
 I was busy replaying my conversation with Brandon as I walked around the corner of the building.
 The air was already hot enough to suck the moisture out of rocks, but that wasn't the cause of the sudden rush of heat to my face.
 I didn't think I'd ever seen the boy before, but Jasmin was easily recognizable, even half-hidden amid all the intermittently-functioning cooling units that lived on this end of the building.
 I couldn't see much beyond the boy's wild red hair, but even that was enough to tell he wasn't completely comfortable.
 I wanted to turn around and go back the other way, but there was a chance that Jasmin had already seen me, and if so I couldn't afford to look like I was scared of her.

And Hudson is Tony Hudson.
 Tell the readers who he is.
 BG:  	Shit.
 Think Boogie Man.
 Think Pazuza.
 He’s the antichrist.
 He broke up Black Lung, not Lorelei, not me.
 The minute that raincloud in a suit walked into our studio—our fucking studio, where we made magic, man, where it all happened—the minute he walked in, in his appropriate sharkskin suit, we were fucked.
 Crafty brought him in, of course.
 He was Kim’s father, as you know.

“I will darken his dreams, just as I have shown you.
 He is a cowardly man, and fears the elves already.
 I played a large part in his decision to banish the elves from the city.
 After I’m done, he will want them gone from all his lands, including here.”
 The man in black gestured to the city nestled against the forest.
 “This city has long been treated neutral, even though it resides within Neldar’s border.
 The elves will not take kindly to removal from a home many have lived in since before our dear king’s grandparents were alive.”
 “I eagerly await the bloodshed,” Qurrah said.
 He bowed to his master.
 “Go.

"You too.
 Let me walk you to your car."
 Sharon smiled at Rick again when Ted and Lauri closed the door behind them.
 "This is the first time I've actually walked out of a fix-up without breathing a sigh of relief."
 "I know what you mean."
 "It's usually so awkward, even if the guy is nice.
 But I felt comfortable tonight.
 I had a good time."
 "So did I."
 Rick opened her car door.

There weren't that many of them, but they could've decided to push the issue regardless."
 I spent the rest of the trip, expecting someone to jump out of the trees, but faster than I'd have believed possible, the wrought iron gates I'd noticed on our trip out last night were swinging open, and we were turning off onto Alec's asphalt lane.
 A distinguished-looking gentleman in his fifties was waiting for us as we screeched to a stop.
 His slightly disapproving frown hinted at decades of practice letting his 'bosses' know when they'd just crossed some kind of line, all the while never crossing any himself.
 The shape shifters all exited the car, most before it had even stopped moving, and then Jessica and Dominic both appeared as I made my comparatively slow way out of the vehicle.
 "...everyone's okay.
 I was somewhat worried about taking so much of our strength away.
 I'm glad it worked out."
 Alec turned towards the older man as I made my hesitant way over to the group.
 "Donovan, this is the young lady we hosted last night.

Emily, Jason, and Seth ran up behind me and we stared into the cave.
 I took a deep breath and started to enter the cave.
 All of a sudden, a roar made me freeze.
 Two nostrils and eyes popped up from the cave.
 My blood stopped.
 It was a dragon.
 Chapter 8
 I stood, frozen in fear at the sight of the dragon.
 It stalked towards me.
 The piercing green eyes bore into mine and I was more scared than I had ever been in all 15 years of my life.

Before he could, a feminine voice shouted down the alley, startling all three.
 “Both of you, stop that this instant!”
 Through blurred vision, Harruq saw a woman with auburn hair standing at the edge of the alley.
 The patrolmen also turned to look, their weapons still in hand.
 “Who the abyss…‌oh, go on back to your forest, Aurelia.
 Nothing to see here.”
 The woman pointed to the bleeding half-orc.
 “I see plenty.”
 “Just cleaning up some filth.” The bowman shifted his bow onto his shoulder.
 “Now move along.”

For a second I couldn't blame the other girls for swarming him over.
 He was so attractive it was hard to remember he was such a jerk.
 I forced myself to stop wondering if anyone else in the entire world had such incredibly blue eyes, and tilted my head to the side questioningly.
 "Sorry, I can tell you're not really in the mood to work on our project, especially with all of the racket today, but I saw you limping down the stairs just before lunch.
 Are you okay?"
 It was almost convincing.
 If he hadn't mentioned the stairs, and thereby the fight, I might have fallen for it, but he was just looking for more attention.
 "I'll be okay.
 Just a little sprain."
 Alec looked like he wanted to say something else, but finally nodded and sat down in the next chair over.

I didn't offer any additional information, so she tried to defuse the awkwardness by asking about electives.
 I answered numbly, picking out classes nearly at random.
 I already knew a school this size wouldn't have anything truly interesting.
 I'd never been willing to dedicate the time required to learn a musical instrument.
 I've always been passable at drawing scenery, but anything more complicated than a stick figure gives me fits, so art was out too.
 Unless possibly the teacher liked Neolithic cave drawings.
 By the time I surfaced from my musings, Mrs. Pendely had printed my schedule out on an ancient piece of machinery, handed me a map of the school and a locker assignment, and then dashed off a handwritten note to my first teacher.
 I somehow found my first class before the bell rang.
 Mrs. Sorenson, my biology teacher, was a skinny old woman with curly white hair that looked like Greek paintings of Medusa.
 She made me introduce myself to the class and then let me slink over to my assigned seat.

One of these things was the expensive camera we had given him for Christmas.
 It was at the pawnshop.
 Agenda Item Two: Retrieve valuables from the pawnshop.
 The camera was sitting at a local pawnshop as collateral on a loan that expired on the very day we got there for it.
 It was the first time I had ever stepped foot in a pawnshop; it was a shit hole covered with other people’s Christmas and birthday presents.
 It was humiliating for me to be in this place and my son could not look me in the eyes the entire time we were there.
 The walls were lined with guitars, the glass counters held cameras, jewelry and trinkets of all types.
 The floors and shelves were covered with tools and equipment.
 The stuff was busting out of the place.
 The people who ran it were the lowest form of life, preying on the weak, broke and addicted.

I offered to split the pay off.
 Cliff and I postponed our move to San Francisco and went looking for work, which we found at Coffee Dan's restaurant in Grossmont Center, a mall we could see from the front yard of my mom's hilltop home.
 I was a pot washer six days a week, a split shift, 10-2 and 6-10.
 Sundays and late evenings I played with Liz.
 Before work and between shifts, I carried on where Eric had left off reading dark novels.
 One of them was Crime and Punishment, by Fyodor Dostoyevski.
 The story tells of Raskolnikov, a dropped out university student a few years older than me, who is possessed with a deep bitterness because he is brilliant but also poor.
 Both to save his sister from marrying a wealthy snob and to prove a theory of his, he decides to rob a pawnbroker, knowing that the act might require murder.
 His theory maintains that even acts of violence can be justified for certain special people who intend to use the results of violence for the good of all or many.
 The special people, whose brilliance and high intentions exempted them from society's laws, were to me the same supermen Nietzsche urged us to become.

“Interesting.
 Do I get one too?”
 In answer, Aurelia smacked her staff against Harruq’s shin.
 The half-orc roared in pain as he hopped up and down on one foot.
 “Damn it!” he shouted.
 “What was that for?”
 “Hitting you is my reward for doing well,” she said.
 “Consider it my way of making sure you don’t go easy on me.
 So are you ready to begin?”
 Harruq mumbled something obscene.

And that’s sitar on it—though we miked it so it sounds sort of like a harp.
 CM: 	Ok.  “Building Cla-Le-Clare?”
 BG:  	You know, Larry co-wrote that.
 CM:  	Larry?
 BG:  	Raspberry.
 As in the Highsteppers.
 We wrote that when I was back in Memphis because my mother was in the hospital.
 Larry came and sat with me in her room—he’s a bloke, man, a true spirit.
 He would come and sit with me, and, while we were watching over her—it was horrible, stomach cancer, and her heart was weak, I thought, shit, we’re losing her—anyway, Larry was there.
 And we wrote that song next to my mother’s hospital bed.

It’s raw—actually not bad for all its rawness.
 Sometimes overcooking leads to worse performances.
 There’s a live version of “A Marriage of Rue,” which is just horrendous.
 I’m not sure which concert it comes from but I’m guessing an early one.
 It doesn’t sound like we’re even playing the same song.
 And Skippy sounds like he’s off in Oz—he was often a lost mook.
 CM:  	What else?
 BG:  	Have you heard this thing or not?
 CM:  	No, I haven’t heard it.
 It was being circulated in Memphis right before I came out here.

She could draw her own conclusions about what the change in the article meant.
 Excited, he stood and headed for her room.
 But when he reached her door, he hesitated.
 Would she believe him about the article?
 She still felt loyal to that jerk, and she might not believe him.
 Especially since it was pretty obvious that he himself had something to gain by convincing her that she shouldn’t marry Davis.
 His sister had once told him that a girl usually wouldn’t even believe her best friend if she told her that her boyfriend was cheating on her.
 He went back to his office and read the article again.
 He should have shown it to Marie before he’d fallen in love with her.
 But he was afraid to tell her he’d known of her before she’d walked into the garden.

He remembered thinking he had seen an animal during the fight.
 “Maybe we were in a wolf pack’s territory, and they were just making sure that we were not disturbing their young,” he thought.
 Happily, this night proved to be more restful and peaceful then the last.
 CHAPTER 5 A PLACE OF PRIDE
 Rodregas drove the wagon with Imeralda sitting next to him; Doi’van continued his impressive show of endurance by actually jogging next to the wagon and showing no trouble keeping up.
 As the trail was more of a hunting path than a proper road and they were traveling on an upward incline, the wagon was struggling to make much time.
 It was not until their midday stop that the three had any real conversation.
 “So,” asked Imeralda, “where are we going?
 I assume it is not the Northern Kingdoms as you said to Audrian.
 For one thing that would be stupid, and for a second you seem to be climbing ever higher into the Arida Mountains and that is hardly the best way north.” Rodregas nodded.

It felt funny to smile.
 The gesture belonged with perfect times, not ones in which people other than me were having nervous breakdowns.
 Then again, a bad night with Alec still somehow managed to beat most other good nights.
 "Everything was almost perfect.
 If there was anything less than ideal, it wasn't your fault."
 "Still, I'd like to make it up to you."
 He looked down at my ankle and then smiled with a hint of mischievousness.
 "I suppose dancing is out, but I think I've got something that'll do just about as well."
 Alec carefully picked me up before I could respond.
 A few seconds later we were outside, traveling through the darkness with a breakneck speed that would've been suicidal with merely human vision.

“Fine but I'm tired of waiting, Seth.” “I know, I promise I'll tell them,” He stood up, his grip still tight.
 “I just don't think now is the right time.
 After something like falling out of the sky, I don't want to bring more bad news.” I sighed.
 “Alright, I'll leave this to you.
 But I swear...” “I will, I promise you!” he interrupted me.
 “I believe you, Seth,” I whispered.
 “Now are you good and clear?” Seth stared at me, looked down at my arm and let go.
 He brushed his dirty hair away from his eyes and looked around.

He turned north and ran deeper into Singhelm.
 He doubted any humans patrolled the area, not after the defeat of their army.
 If he was to find safety, it would be there.
 In each ragged breath, he gasped, tasting copper on his tongue.
 His back ached, and his whole body revolted against his constant motion.
 Still, he had no choice.
 He passed by home after home, each one dark and quiet.
 It seemed the occupants of Singhelm were terrified the elves might seek vengeance for the king’s edict.
 Qurrah chuckled though it felt like hammers pummeled his chest.
 He spread his hands to either side and bathed a few houses with fire.

I see you beside me, a strong ally, but I see another half-orc leading my army.
 He is strong and wields two enormous swords.
 Again I ask, do you have a brother?”
 Qurrah pulled out a bone from his pouch and stared at it.
 “I do,” he said.
 “You wish for him to help?”
 “He will do more than aid us,” Velixar whispered to the moon.
 “His power is as great as yours, Qurrah.
 You two are vessels of possibility unseen in centuries.
 It is as if one of the gods had a hand in your creation.”

 Her tears spilled over.

At least that’s the advice that you’ve given to me for the last ten years.
 Art – I mean I haven’t been on a date in over twenty years.
 I don’t have a clue what I should wear on a first date.
 Jim – Why don’t you just go in the same kind of thing you’re wearing now?
 Art – Won’t she think that I’m a slob?
 Jim – Why are you asking me that?
 I don’t know her, and to be honest women confuse the hell out of me.
 All I know is that the only way to appease them is to offer sacrifices of flowers.
 Art – The flower trick is important, but it doesn’t always work.
 You need to remember to compose poems to their great beauty.

As I remembered the risk I’d put myself under coming here.
 I strained to listen but could only pick out parts of the conversation.
 “Well on her way to becoming a Council member… if anyone should leave…” “Yes, but who can trust him…” “Why can’t we simply banish… who knows if the spells will even hold… dark magic can’t be trusted…” I was trying to hear them, irritated they were talking so low, and the harder I listened, the more I perceived a dull, buzzing hum.
 My ears popped.
 And then, at once, the group began to scratch at themselves feverishly, clawing at forearms, abdomens, and necks.
 Each wore an uncomfortable, even frightened, expression as they hurried out of the room and into an inner Council chamber.
 I was considering the strangeness of it as I made my way through the now-vacant room, but was distracted by the sight of the library door.
 I had no way of knowing if there would be a protection spell on the entry.
 When I walked through, there were no obvious repercussions and I assumed that, with so many Council members around, they must not have thought it necessary.
 The Council library was overwhelming.

In past centuries the sovereignty of nations may have been based on the principle that might is right.
 In our more enlightened age, however, the only acceptable basis for a nation’s sovereignty is that it expresses the will of its own people, and this condition can only be met under a freely chosen form of government that enables people to express their own free will and determine their own destiny.
 Therefore, the decision of the UN to insist on the operation of democratic processes in member countries is an essential step toward resolving the dilemma of sovereignty.
 When the representative nature of a national government is in question, its claim to sovereignty over its own people under all circumstances is also questionable.
 Hitherto, it has not been possible to address this issue forth rightly, because the evolution of the international community had not yet come to accept in practice, as opposed to merely in principle, the fundamental human rights so frequently espoused in constitutions and ignored in actions.
 This situation has changed, especially after humanity’s bitter experiments with totalitarian regimes during this century.
 It is now recognized that the democratic principles of political freedom, social equality, self-determination and related human rights are inalienable and must be extended to all people everywhere.
 The second factor that naturally imposes limits on national sovereignty – the rights of other nations and their citizens – has also gained substantially wider acceptance, has been enshrined by international law, and has become accepted doctrine governing many facets of international relations.
 Common security against transnational threats and common prosperity for all humankind cannot be based on a 250-year-old concept of nation sovereignty.
 Over the last half century, national sovereignty has been maturing into international sovereignty.

Rick smiled, accepting the cup of tea Ted had known he'd want.
 "I'm liking this girl better and better."
 She arrived five minutes later, and Rick's earlier impressions held.
 She was pretty and slender, friendly but just reticent enough to convince him he wasn't being pursued.
 "Lauri says you're a paralegal," Rick said as they sat sipping tea and coffee before dinner.
 "Yeah--in Charlestown."
 "Is that where you live?"
 "No--I live in the North End.
 It's not a bad drive unless the traffic is really bad."
 The conversation was enjoyable, the dinner delicious, and Rick was glad he'd come.

Johnny – Very funny.
 Jim - We can always hope though.
 It’d be the easiest way to solve the problem.
 Johnny – How so?
 By not doing anything?
 Jim – We could get a voodoo doll of him and poke it with pins.
 Johnny – That won’t work.
 Liz – How do you know?
 Johnny – I tried it already.
 Jim - Who on?

Gorin lifted a large handle and solid squares of iron slid out of the floor and the ceiling.
 When both the top and the bottom fully released the guard pushed the doors wide.
 The three immediately pushed through and Rodregas said, “You can close the doors.
 I will pound on them when we are ready to leave.” And with a nervous nod the doors slid closed behind them.
 As the door closed Gorin hastily added, “Remember not to touch anything until the Grand Marshal is present.” Doi’van nodded at the now closed doors and raised his torch.
 The three gazed around the room in wonderment.
 In response to the torch the room seemed to respond with a vague light of its own, which came from all directions.
 The chamber was large with a tall vaulted ceiling like some temple, but no rows of seats or prayer mats did this temple hold.
 Instead it was filled with beasts; lions and wolves and the great mythical animals of the Celestial Realm.
 Most of these he recognized as the great totems of the Celestial Realm, each representing great power.

Johnny – No, I used yellow food coloring.
 We were out of red at the time.
 Jim – Perhaps that is why you’re attempt at using dark magic failed.
 However I doubt that voodoo curses would solve our problems anyhow.
 Liz – Red food coloring would have been a little better, but not much.
 Jim – You could have at least used Tabasco sauce or something, we always have that.
 Johnny – I didn’t think it would matter what I put in if I didn’t have the Dodo blood.
 Liz – Good point.
 Jim – Guess we can discount using dark magic or voodoo to solve the problem of Gene’s father.
 Johnny – What do you suggest then?

Jim – Shhhh!
 Is she gone?
 Liz – Yes, my mother is gone, and I think she promised not to bother you any more.
 Jim – Finally.
 What do you mean ‘think she promised’?
 Liz – Exactly what I said, I think she promised to behave.
 Jim – I’m confused…
 Liz – Why am I not surprised…
 Jim – Wouldn’t that be something that would have either a yes or no answer?
 If I asked about the existence of God, or the origin of the universe, or whether or not Twinkies lasted forever, I would expect you to say ‘maybe’ but not for ‘will your mom leave me alone?’

"I don't know what you're talking about.
 Nothing happened."
 Deny everything.
 It's essentially the motto of two entire generations now.
 Make them tell you exactly how much they know before you admit to anything, and then only admit to the parts they already know about.
 It's a crappy way to run a society, but I'm just one kid.
 I can't be blamed for just trying to keep my head down and survive.
 We were already pulling into the parking lot.
 He must have been driving even faster than normal.
 That should have triggered another panic attack, but the tension in the black Mustang was high enough to distract my subconscious for now.

The changes called for in this report require changes of attitude of this magnitude.
 But no longer is it necessary for a great visionary leader to espouse a new attitude.
 The higher general levels of public education, the worldwide extension of the media and the active initiative of literally thousands of institutions serving the public interest can exert a powerful force for change, which sooner or later political leaders will accept and espouse.
 What is the shift in attitudes demanded to achieve global peace and prosperity?
 From a competitive, egocentric, state-centred attitude toward national security, that seeks to enhance security for some nations at the expense of the rest of the world, to an attitude of true global cooperation for collective human security.
 From demanding that other nations grant democratic rights to their people to a willingness to extend democratic principles to the governance of international institutions.
 From preoccupation with problems and limitations to an appreciation of the opportunities for more rapid development.
 From wanting to meet people’s minimum needs to wanting to help them realize their maximum potentials.
 From the attitude that everything is determined by external constraints – money, other nations, political leaders, the general public – to the attitude that everything is determined by our inner resource fulness and that there are no limits to what it can accomplish.
 From viewing the developing world as a problem or a burden to viewing it as a vast untapped potential for global progress.

“What are you doing here?” He glanced at Chevelle, who was still plainly annoyed, and his carefree smile dissolved.
 “I was heading to Bray and ran across some trackers.” Chevelle’s eyes flicked to my face and then back to Steed.
 Steed dropped his hands from my waist as he winked at me.
 “I saw the horses out front and couldn’t resist.
 Knew you’d be missing me.” I tried to smile, but the thought of trackers had taken the thrill off the unexpected visit.
 The vision of flames was threatening again and I swallowed hard.
 Chevelle threw on his cloak, hood up.
 “Stay here,” he ordered me.
 He gestured toward Steed, who turned to follow him outside.
 I wasn’t sure how long they’d be gone; I went to one of the narrow windows on the front wall and peered cautiously out.

Two shattered little dolls trying our best to make sure the pieces don't blow away and leave us with nothing.
 An imposition to everyone around us."
 He hugged me to him as he shook his head.
 "Not an imposition.
 Never that."
 It felt wrong to try and kiss Alec right now.
 I didn't want to make light of Rachel's hurt, or Jasmin's loneliness, but his presence was too great a temptation to pass up.
 My face started out in the hollow of his neck, drinking in the ambrosia of his scent, and then moved up towards his lips without conscious decision on my part.
 Our lips met, and it felt like a warm, pleasant surge of electricity washed from my head down to the tips of my toes.
 My head started spinning almost instantly, only my hand on his chest, and his arms around my waist kept me from losing my balance completely.

“Are you going to join them?” he asked.
 The elf nodded.
 “They are my family.
 This is my home.
 I cannot abandon them.”
 Harruq’s heart skipped, and the words of his brother echoed in his head.
 He had to make her understand.
 “Aurry, I’m asking you, please don’t fight.
 You aren’t needed.
 The elves will win, right?

Then he felt his ankle start to burn.
 “Take him, brother,” Qurrah said, his whip wrapped around Ahrqur’s left foot.
 Harruq did not bother to cross the distance.
 He had had enough.
 Condemnation flew through the air, its aim true.
 The blade sank into the elf’s back.
 Blood and fluid covered the carpet as all life fled the body of Ahrqur Tun’del.
 Harruq strolled forward, the sound of his ragged breathing filling the sudden quiet.
 He drew out his sword, grimacing at the sick wet sound it made.
 “What do we do about all the blood?” he asked.

"And the third lucky person is Suzanne Bergerman."
 And my chances were down to two, with even worse odds than I'd had a second before.
 My hands hurt, only when I looked down to see why, it was because my fingernails were digging into my palms.
 The blood was pounding so furiously in my ears that I couldn't hear the next name read.
 I could tell it wasn't mine though because nobody turned back to congratulate me.
 There was only one name left to be read, and I knew that it wasn't going to be mine.
 I'd never been that lucky in my entire life.
 As quickly as that my pulse slowed and my fists relaxed.
 I could clearly hear as Principal Gossil cleared his throat and continued.
 "The fifth winner is Ms. Adriana Paige."

As it was, I quickly realized my little walk home was going to be twice as unpleasant as I'd expected.
 The school most definitely wasn't in the pretty, green part of the region.
 Every step kicked up a miniature cloud of fine, red dust that drifted into my lungs and slowly coated my clothes.
 The dust would've been plenty bad all by itself, but the heat made things even worse.
 It was only an hour or two removed from the hottest part of the day, and the air was so dry it sucked moisture out of me with each breath.
 I knew it was stupid to walk home.
 My one little bottle of water wasn't going to last me five miles in this oven, but I was tired of always having to be sensible about everything.
 I was going to walk, and that was it.
 Maybe if I passed out on the side of the road and ended up in the hospital Britney would finally realize what a wench she was.
 I was barely out of sight of the school, still vividly imagining Alec and Britney's faces when they found out that they'd put me in the hospital, when I heard a car approaching from behind me.

The tingle of shape shifter power was as strong as I'd ever felt it, jumping from multiple sources, arcing around me as it unsuccessfully looked for a place to ground out.
 For the first time, I was able to accurately pick out the individual signatures that made it up.
 Jess was off to the left, white hot with mixed anger and fear, stabilized only by the cool, controlled pillar of power that was Isaac.
 Jasmin almost hummed under my fingertips like barely-leashed violence, while my other hand drank from the still pond that was Dominic, her mere presence feeding me comfort.
 I'd just finished identifying the raging beast to the right as James, when Brandon stepped into the light.
 He looked like some kind of pagan god, smeared all over with blood, an uneven circle drawn on his chest, filled with sharp, angry lines that didn't mean anything to me, but which made the wolves around me tense and growl.
 "While I appreciate the sentiment, it really is far too late to secure absolution by bringing me the girl."
 His voice had changed, becoming deeper and harsher, with elements that didn't sound like they could come from any human throat.
 He stepped forward, and I felt my chest seize up.
 The transformation I'd sensed the beginnings of at the dance had run its course now and any question as to why someone as cultured as Brandon would associate with a near-psychopath like Vincent was put to rest.

He had the impression that these foul books were of the most evil soul-stealing magic of the Immortalists.
 He opened up the fireplace and started to chuck all the evil books into the fire with the poker.
 The ones from which magic radiated he placed into the trunk; true books of magic would sell nicely.
 The process of sorting the books and then getting them to burn took several hours and he started to feel how long it had been since his new body had slept.
 The sound of the tower was changing, the first sounds of the kitchen crew getting ready for the morning.
 Still he kept at it, though there seemed to be nothing else of wealth in the room.
 He was determined to see the evil books burn.
 They held the secrets to the Immortalist art and other dark magic.
 Leaving them would only lead to another person rising in Ravenhurr’s place.
 Several of the foulest books seemed to refuse to burn but the flames eventually consumed all, just as they had consumed Ravenhurr.

He fired three at once, all burying deep into Velixar’s chest.
 The man in black screamed as the sacred water burned his skin.
 He fell to one knee and vomited a pile of white flesh and maggots.
 “You will suffer,” he gasped.
 “For ages, I will make you suffer.”
 “Try it,” said Dieredon.
 Two more arrows flew, but they halted in mid-air.
 Velixar stood, his hand outstretched, gripping the projectiles with his mind.
 The elf fired two more volleys but all the arrows froze beside the others.
 “Fool,” Velixar hissed.

By thirteen he had his own band, made up of less-skilled classmates at Snowden Elementary.
 They called themselves Regulation Footwear and soon were playing gigs at high school dances and other social occasions, at Clearpool, even at an end-of-school year rally at the Overton Park Shell, foreshadowing later triumphs.
 Clearly, it was Buddy people came to see, Buddy who garnered them engagements with older audiences.
 Regulation’s drummer, poor Gyp Leach, could barely keep time on his Sears drumset, taking lessons after school at Guitar & Drum City, just progressing past a four-four beat.
 But word was spreading about this precocious guitarist who sounded like a coup de foudre, this scrawny, pimply 8th grader with licks like a junkyard dog.
 Buddy Gardner.
 It was Jim Dickinson who dubbed Buddy “Slipshod,” not because Buddy was a sloppy player but because he put together such sloppy groups around him.
 It mattered not to Buddy who was playing behind him.
 He was lost in the ether, playing for his own private gods, letting the Lydian reverberation carry him away, the sound coming from his own self, you see.
 Oh, of course, he knew when the bassist was faking it, or the drummer tripping over himself to keep up, or the rhythm guitarist playing the same three chords over and over, hoping his stroking would be lost in the thunder.

My eyes closed once more as the pain doubled and I lost my body for a moment.
 I concentrated until I got it back and then realized I was bouncing.
 I worked my eyes again, using every ounce of control I had left.
 I was on a horse, running.
 Not my own.
 Chevelle was holding me in front of him, my body limp and useless.
 I fought to focus on more but was overtaken by pain.
 We were running away?
 I could control nothing but my mind, and that just barely.
 As my eyes closed again, I reached out and found my horse as he lay motionless on the ground, my Steed.

These real and significant gains have been offset and to a large extent obscured in our minds by the persistence and aggravation of problems that constitute the other side of the post-Cold War ledger.
 Far from vanishing, the nuclear danger has been aggravated by the continued proliferation of nuclear weapons, the increasing danger of these weapons falling into the hands of terrorists, and the stubborn refusal of the existing nuclear powers to seize the opportunity to totally eradicate this pernicious arsenal of self-annihilation.
 Reduced confrontation between nation states has been followed by an aggravation of internal conflicts within countries as well as a dramatic increase in threats of violence by disenchanted minorities.
 Violent local conflicts continue to flare around the world.
 Terrorist acts have intensified against civilian populations on every continent.
 While the worst fears about rising unemployment in the West have been dispelled, the challenge of generating sufficient employment opportunities for all people around the world remains a pressing concern.
 The rich-poor divide has increased within and between nations.
 Inadequate job/livelihood opportunities resulting in inadequate purchasing power have now become the most important cause of endemic and hidden hunger.
 Most regrettable has been the failure to enhance the powers and strengthen reliance on effective multilateral institutions.
 The emergence of the USA as the sole superpower has brought with it a reduction in the role and influence of the UN in international affairs, precisely at a time when the world should be striving to build a viable multilateral cooperative security system.

“Tomorrow morning,” she said.
 He raged and sputtered but could think of nothing to say or do.
 Finally, he started walking.
 “Where are you going?” she asked him.
 “To get my brother,” he said without turning around.
 “They will kill you,” she shouted.
 “They will see you and kill you.
 You do your brother nothing by running off to die.”
 “Then what am I supposed to do?” he screamed.
 He whirled around, his helplessness showing on every feature of his face.

I cannot see into the Infernal or Elemental Realms, and I think you have entered both.
 I do not know what this means.” The two continued through the grass for a few moments in silence.
 The Great Lion did not understand the Goddess’ questions or concerns.
 But he understood his own power, which in its way was as great as any god’s.
 He growled, “Do you wish me to hunt, to fight?
 Is our pride in danger?” Blodeuwedd nodded, “Yes and yes and yes.
 In their great quest for power, The Immortalist Taiga and his followers, such as that vermin Van’dret, must all be stopped.
 They do not understand that if they upset the balance that the final battle between Infernal and Celestial could destroy all.” She paused and then added in a voice that he almost thought he sensed fear in, “I think the sword Caledfwlch must be found.
 The other gods won’t like it.
 They might even oppose finding it, but it might be our only hope.” The great head nodded, and the Goddess stepped away and was gone, but the roar that followed could be heard across the grasslands and into the forest and to the peaks of the mountains beyond.

It wasn't attraction, it'd been too neutral for that.
 Envy, fear, friendship, none of them fit.
 Whoever he was, he quietly left the room while my head was still whirling.
 I looked up to find Britney frowning at me.
 "What is your deal?
 I don't think I've ever seen Isaac notice anyone other than his girlfriend.
 He isn't like Alec, who notices everyone but is too good to actually speak to any of us.
 Isaac's just so caught up in whatever is going on inside his head that he doesn't realize any of us exist."
 Britney slammed her book.
 "First Brandon decides he has the hots for you, and then you crack the ivory tower.

She’d never dreamed anything could make her feel this way.
 “Are you hungry?” he asked, kissing the tip of her nose.
 “Starved.”  She hugged him.
 They went downstairs with their arms around each other.
 “Did you make pancakes?” she asked.
 “Yeah.
 I’m starved, and I figured you would be too.
 So we’re having pancakes and bacon and eggs and juice.” “Mmm—that sounds great.
 And it smells even better.”  She sat down, poured syrup on her pancakes, and dug in.
 “Delicious,” she said, swallowing.

Finally, Taiga brought up the point that Van’dret believed had gained him the honor of joining Taiga in his solar.
 “So I understand that you are to journey to the Cathedral of the Heavens for this year’s open tourney?” Taiga asked his voice as melodic as one would expect from an elf, but just a tad deeper than one would think.
 “Yes, my lord, I leave in the morning,” Van’dret replied.
 “Excellent, you will have to keep your eyes open for potential talent worthy of the Immortal Guard,” Taiga stated.
 Van’dret nodded, that was one of his main responsibilities, but it could not be why he had been invited up to Taiga’s solar.
 “I would encourage you to be careful on your trip over.
 You did hear about what happened to Ravenhurr?” asked Taiga.
 Van’dret almost felt his eye brows rise, “of course, but what should I watch out for?
 I heard it was just some sort of accident.
 I was not aware that any of the Knights of the Order were implicated.” Taiga smiled and waved a hand in a dismissing motion.

I wrote a damn good song.
 I was back, you know, back, but different.
 Different but the same.
 This is what I want everyone to understand.
 What I want to say—the difference is not a drama, the difference is a poem, a song, a way of looking at life, that’s slightly atilt, slightly askew, perhaps, but it’s all me, you know?
 It’s what I am.
 I am a songwriter.
 That was finding my soul.

“And what is that, Qurrah?
 What are you and your brother?”
 The fire sparked a shower of orange into the sky as Qurrah spoke.
 “Superior.”
 In the distance, elven eyes watched that cough of flame stretch to the stars, as well as the sight of those two huddled figures talking long through the night.

 The first week of training went well for both Harruq and Aurelia.
 The half-orc kept on the offensive, determined not to add a fresh set of bruises to his body.
 Aurelia still fell for the feints, however slow, but her blocks were already quicker and more precise.

 The doctor said that you had to take the pills every day.

The old me would have told Britney she was a self-centered wench, but the new me, the one that was all too aware of how much it would suck to go through the next two years of school without a single friend, just forced my face into something approximating a smile and tried to explain why drawing something at random from a bag with replacement was different than drawing something from a bag without replacement.
 It was a fairly straightforward concept that we'd seen twice now.
 I was pretty sure Britney was capable of understanding, she just didn't care, which was the one thing virtually guaranteed to make me mad.
 Stupidity was bad enough; laziness would be a hundred times worse.
 Still, by the second time through I'd clarified a couple of points I'd been a little fuzzy on, and was almost ready to believe Britney might actually apply herself to listening.
 I was so caught up in what I was doing, and the ever-so-slowly growing light of interest in Britney's eyes, that the rest of the class had fallen silent for a full twenty seconds before the drop in noise registered for me.
 "I want everyone back to their regular desks and hard at work on their assignments."
 Mrs. Campbell wasn't as pale as she'd been when she'd left, but she still looked unsettled and more than a little unhappy, presumably with both whatever had caused her to leave so quickly, and the fact that she'd come back to a class where almost nobody had been doing anything productive.
 I had a couple of heartbeats to hope she'd realized I'd been trying to help Britney with her homework, and therefore not deserving of any punishment.
 "Britney, Adriana, I'll need to speak with you both after the bell."

So at last she jumped up and ran into the waves.
 Rick woke up slowly with no idea of how long he'd been asleep.
 It had been an exhausting week, and he'd gotten less sleep than usual.
 Of course, he'd had much more fun than usual too, he thought with a lazy smile.
 He turned to see if Marie was asleep.
 She wasn't there!
 Springing to his feet, he looked around.
 The beach had become crowded while he was asleep, and he didn't see her anywhere.
 "Marie!"
 he called in a moderately loud voice.

I will honor that with my own honesty.
 I don’t know exactly how I ended up in this body, but I do know that I killed Ravenhurr, and I killed his bastard assistant, Korin.
 The Immortalists are a sore on the world.
 Their use of others’ bodies and power and their very way of life is abhorrent.” Rodregas looked Doi’van in the eyes and said, “The name I was born with is Rodregas.
 When I decided to kill Ravenhurr, I promised the gods that if they let me survive, I would take on the duty of killing the Immortalists.
 It is a duty that I know will end in my death.
 There are hundreds of Immortalists.
 Some almost as powerful as gods, but it is a good death and one I have chosen.” Rodregas paused and looked at Doi’van’s features.
 They were brutish and rough by human standards, but his instincts said that this man was honest, and he added, “If for a while you wish to share my duty and fight at my side, then we walk a path bathed in the Celestial light.” Rodregas had spoken slowly and clearly so Doi’van would understand the depth of what he said.
 They stood there gripping each other’s forearms and then Doi’van nodded and replied, “Then let us walk this path together.” He was speaking in that deep voice; his statement had finality about it.

“No doubt about it.”
 He laughed to the others and then punched Harruq in the gut.
 As the half-orc doubled over, the guard grabbed his hair and tugged.
 “Got to be a disguise,” he said.
 Another guard used the hilt of his sword to strike Harruq’s back.
 The blow blasted the air out of his lungs.
 The leader of the guards tugged all along Harruq’s face, pulling hair and scratching skin.
 “I’ll be,” he said.
 “It is real.
 No illusion and no disguise.

Mrs. Tranton rose.
 "Would you like me to put your handkerchief in the laundry?"
 "No!"
 Marie recoiled.
 "This is Rick's.
 Please don't ever let Hattie wash it or the shirt."
 She nodded toward the t-shirt on the pillow.
 Mrs. Tranton gazed down at her for a moment.
 "I'm sorry, darling."
 She kissed Marie's forehead and left.

The year my kids began to climb out of the mud, I met Pam.
 * Back when I had only one child, someone told me that two was as easy or easier than one.
 Whoever said that ought to be gagged.
 At least in my family, while one kid slept, the other wouldn’t.
 When one behaved, the other raised hell.
 Everything one gets, the other wants.
 And so on.
 (Read Mark Twain’s Roughing It to learn how this plays out in large Mormon families.)
 I told Pam one kid would be plenty for me and suggested that even the one could wait until after I had rested for a couple years from raising Darcy and Cody, who by now were adults so admirable that just thinking about them often made me glow.
 Several of my friends with grown kids had married younger women and right away gotten snipped, but I couldn’t deny Pam the experience of being a mother, knowing I might’ve remained a loveless semi-zombie without Darcy and Cody.

A few seconds later I heard the howl of an after-market exhaust fed by a turbo-charged engine.
 The green Honda that came screaming through the parking lot was hardly recognizable as an Accord.
 It was approaching too quickly, but I couldn't bring myself to care.
 Besides, Rachel seemed unconcerned.
 Rachel helped me up as the car came to a screeching halt, all four tires locking up to slide it around so that the passenger side was facing us.
 The over-tinted windows smoothly slid down to reveal that James was indeed the driver, and he wasn't any happier than he'd been a few seconds earlier.
 I started towards the back seat, only to feel Rachel's surprisingly-firm grasp guide me towards the front seat.
 She got me settled and then slipped in behind me.
 James pulled out of the parking lot with a rush of acceleration that pinned me to my seat.
 Normally I'd have gripped the door hard enough to make my fingers creak, but I was still strangely unconcerned with the possibility of dying.

I will retrieve an elf to deliver it to the king.”
 The man in black stood and motioned to the stars.
 “Follow the left wing,” he said, his finger pointing to the constellation in the stars referred to as the raven.
 “It will not be long before you see the light of their campfire.
 Make haste.
 The battle grows closer with every move we make.”
 “Yes, master,” they echoed before beginning their trek.

 "Did he treat you properly?"
 "Yes.
 Oh, Mother, I wish you could meet him.

 "Is he the reason you ended your betrothal?"
 "In a way.

 I blinked and shook my head.
 “Jazell!

 She slowed down and hugged me tight.
 Jason slapped Seth on the back and bent over to catch his breath.
 “Hey, where were you guys?” I asked.
 “We were looking around to see if it was safe,” Emily said.
 “We thought you two were doing the same.” She put her hands on her hips.

By the looks of things he wasn't going to need any help.
 Once it was just the four of us, Britney waved me over and held up her homework.
 "I don't get it.
 What is the answer to this one?"
 I shook my head in exasperation.
 "Me telling you the answers won't help you on the test.
 If you have a specific question about how to work a problem I'd be more than happy to help you, but I'm not going to do your homework for you."
 Britney looked like she had all kinds of things that she'd like to say, but she showed more restraint that I'd realized she was capable of, and kept them all inside.
 "Please explain this one then."
 I ran through three different examples of the same problem before she got it, but thirty minutes later she was finally working on her homework for the first time I'd ever seen.

I could feel warm tingles start from my shoulders and work their way down my arms.
 A full two seconds of silence passed before I realized he'd asked me why I'd come downstairs.
 "I can't sleep.
 I've been trying, but I'm too wound up to do anything but just lie there.
 I thought I'd come downstairs and talk to you instead.
 I mean, unless it's bothering you.
 You know, keeping you from patrolling or something."
 That last bit hadn't really been planned.
 I'd wanted to come downstairs and talk to him, but wouldn't have dreamt of just saying it outright.
 Maybe it was the natural high I got simply from being around him.

Alec turned around while I was still trying to get my throat to work again.
 "You stopped breathing.
 What's wrong?"
 The tears his touch had dried up a few seconds before were back, and just seconds away from escaping the corners of my eyes by the time I finally pulled myself up onto my knees and managed to speak.
 "Please don't send me there.
 Not after my dream."
 There was just enough moonlight trickling into the room for me to see his expression change.
 My stomach seemed to reach up and wrap itself around my heart as I realized it was the expression he used when it was important to him that people not know what he was thinking.
 "I'm not sure that's the best idea."
 The tears finally made their escape as I crumpled back onto the bed.

First, he went to the dresser and started dumping clothes on the ground.
 He was hoping to find some hidden wealth, stashed in the drawers.
 He ended up with a pile of clothes.
 Some were fancy, but none would be of much use on the road and none were worth selling.
 Next, Rodregas went to the wardrobe, which was engraved with the shape of trees and made of a sweet smelling wood.
 It was much more likely to hold something of value.
 He opened the doors to see brightly colored robes, and there on the left was a suit of chain mail.
 Rodregas could feel his smile.
 Armor!
 He reached in and pulled it out.

He suppressed a shiver of excitement at the notion that this time will be different.
 This time, he would not just cry out to the gods about the injustice while innocent people burned.
 He filled his lungs with stale air tainted with burning pitch and tried to sink into the mindless guard mentality that kept him functioning for the past decade and a half.
 Once a man loses all hope of a decent life, it is astonishing what he will do to stay alive.
 For the last twenty years his following orders and doing his duty, along with his better than average training for a guard, had served him well.
 He had been safe from the bounty on his head and for the most part.
 His life was more boring than anything else.
 He approached the door to the tower roof with the prisoners.
 Instead of formulating a plan of action his mind kept going back to the horror of last week's practice when his master, Ravenhurr, demanded a rehearsal of the ritual ceremony with the senior guards.
 At the time he assumed they would merely walk through the procedure.

I have a surprise for you,” Rodregas whispered under his breath.
 He went around the room one final time poking around for anything else of note and, finding nothing, went over to the door to the water closet.
 Inside he first tested out the plumbing, finding the experience both new and familiar.
 He also had a chance to examine his own plumbing, and was pleased with the results; his new body was large and powerfully built even in places that most people would not see.
 The only thing of use in the water closet was a shaving kit which Rodregas added to the trunk.
 Next he went to the study door only to find it locked.
 He looked for a key but there was nothing.
 He guessed that it was locked by magic and required a magic word or incantation to open the lock.
 He pushed and pulled on the door, but it was solidly made and there was nothing to get a good hold of to test his new strength.
 He looked around for something to use as a pry bar; next to the fireplace was a poker.

The half-orc continued his charge, engaging the two elves behind.
 They struck as one, their swords aiming for vitals high and low.
 Harruq knew he could not block both, so he accepted a thrust curving to the side of his armor, grinning darkly.
 As the sword punched through the enchanted leather, the half-orc cut his adversary’s throat, using that same swing to parry the other attack away.
 The remaining elf swore as his eyes grew red and watery.
 He backed away from the half-orc, his sword held defensively before him.
 “What demon magic is this?” he asked.
 “Mine,” said Qurrah.
 And then blood poured out from the face of the lone elf.
 The eyeballs hit the ground before the dead body did.

Recently, international and bilateral financial institutions have promoted the market as the most effective instrument for managing agriculture throughout the world.
 This view leaves two questions unanswered.
 First, if the market is so effective, why is it that every major capitalist economy utilizes such a vast array of subsidies, incentives, controls, production quotas and fixed pricing mechanisms to govern production and trade in agricultural products?
 Even after GATT, protection for this sector by industrial nations will remain high.
 Second, granted that the market works effectively for mature capitalist societies with high levels of technology, education, productivity, living standards and food surpluses, and relatively small portions of the workforce dependent on agriculture, is the same necessarily true for countries at an earlier stage of development, in which (1) a majority of the workforce is dependent on agriculture for sustenance, (2) levels of education, productivity and incomes are low, and (3) any increase in food prices can have a devastating impact on food consumption levels in the country?
 The answers to these questions are relevant both to the countries presently making the transition from centrally planned to market economies in Eastern Europe and to poorer developing countries striving to achieve food security.
 Nations accord special status to their agricultural sector for several reasons.
 Continuous supplies of food are absolutely essential to the welfare of the population.
 Food prices are extremely sensitive to changes in the supply of foodstuffs.
 Even a small increase or decrease in supply can lead to a very wide fluctuation in prices.

Rodregas was surprised to find a pile of equipment outside his door the next morning, and Imeralda sorting through the pile.
 It appeared to be mostly their equipment plus miscellaneous pieces of slaver gear.
 Doi’van stood watching, clearly not sure what to make of it.
 When Rodregas tried to apologize Imeralda ignored him and instead said, “We traded the Immortal Guard equipment for safe harbor here at the village for healing.
 But, of course, there were also regular slaver guards and I claimed their equipment and any money that was in their personal money pouches.” “Your armor got pretty chopped up,” she continued, “and Doi’van did not have any armor to start with.
 I have been trading excess gear and coins to repair armor and to refit some of the other armor to fit Doi’van and yourself.
 We still had our three horses, but none of them were too great to begin with; the two were good for pulling carriages, the other was too old.” “True,” Rodregas said nodding his agreement.
 “Jordaan knows horse flesh,” she went on, “and we were able to trade the three old horses for one of the Immortal Guards’ horses.
 I will be honest, he is a big ugly brute and not war trained and his Dire blood is marginal.
 But Jordaan thinks he can actually handle Doi’van’s weight.

If I walked out right now I might be okay.
 If however they did kill the brunette, they'd come after me too.
 It was possible, it turned out, to be rational but still completely paralyzed by indecision.
 The girl was sobbing now, and my heart felt like it was about to tear itself into pieces.
 The creak of the bathroom door opening should have been a relief.
 I was expecting the tension to evaporate once there were more witnesses.
 I couldn't have been more wrong.
 The air had felt heavy before, now it felt alive, like ground zero of a lightning strike a split second before the soil was blackened by three hundred thousand volts.
 "Get out."
 "Go to hell."

“How long?” Qurrah asked as he lurched onto his feet.
 “Not long,” Harruq said, holding Qurrah’s shoulder to steady him.
 “The orcs are almost here.”
 As if on cue, they heard a collective roar from the south.
 Harruq glanced at the stairs along the wall, but Qurrah saw this and shook his head.
 “We need to get closer to the fight,” Qurrah said, slurring his words.
 “I need to see him.”
 “Sure thing,” Harruq agreed.
 “Come on.
 I have an idea.”

Europe’s lower labour participation rate is attributable to a number of factors.
 A far higher percentage of the European workforce was engaged in agriculture 25 years ago and has since shifted to non-agricultural sectors, an adjustment that occurred in the United States during earlier decades.
 During the 1980s Europe chose a high-wage path to growth, passing on the benefits to the existing workforce but creating relatively few new jobs; whereas the United States, with a similar economic growth rate over the decade, showed lower income growth per worker, but a steadily rising employment rate.
 Europe is now confronted with the need for structural adjustment to compensate.
 In the United States, the extent of the unemployment problem is partially disguised in the form of low-wage jobs, which distribute total income over a larger number of workers.
 Twenty per cent of all full-time US workers have incomes that fall below the official poverty line for a family of four, though only a quarter of these live in households whose total income is below the poverty line.
 Real wages in the United States have not risen significantly over the last 20 years due to the dramatic increase in the supply of labour as a result of a 62 per cent increase in female participation since 1960 and the entrance of the baby-boom generation into the workforce.
 However, America’s ‘family living standard’ has still risen by 40 per cent since 1970.
 Within the next decade, the aging of the population is expected to reduce job pressures and even lead to labour shortages in some European countries.
 Job growth has been quite rapid in the developing countries over the last forty years, more than doubling total employment.

"I can't promise he'll even read it."
 It was a he who'd intervened on our behalf, and Rachel and Alec's father had died years ago, while Brandon's father...actually I knew next to nothing about Brandon's parents.
 I wasn't even sure whether or not they were around.
 They must be though--if it had been a male who'd saved us, then it couldn't be the Graveses, and that left only Brandon's family.
 It was hard to believe that Brandon had stepped in and done so much for us, but the pieces fit together so tightly.
 Brandon was even more wonderful and amazing than I'd thought before.
 Part of me expected this new revelation to keep my mind whirling so fast that it would take me hours to go to sleep.
 I was only partly right.
 It took quite a while for me to go to sleep, but this time the culprit was the light outside my window.
 Chapter 14 For the first time in longer than I could remember, I woke up two minutes before my alarm went off.

I had gotten so involved in the terrified man’s story and page after page of family names, I had forgotten why I was reading in the first place.
 I sighed.
 Of course, the pages with the V names were missing.
 I felt a stab of guilt for the selfishness of the thought while looking over such loss, but I waved it away and tucked the pages under my mattress.
 Lying back on the bed as I looked up at my mother’s pendant, I closed my eyes, trying to remember… I could see her face.
 Her straight nose, her gentle smile.
 Her long hair waved around her shoulders, stray locks caught by the wind.
 She wore a white dress with bell sleeves and a low-cut neck.
 Her pendant hung there.
 It started to refract light, but there was only darkness around my vision of her.

We are poised at what can become a turning point in the role of war in human affairs.
 The momentous consequences at stake call for decisive action.
 Historically, war has been a means of territorial expansion and economic conquest that strengthened and enriched the conqueror while draining the energy and diminishing the wealth of the conquered.
 War and economic development co-existed and sometimes complemented each other.
 Technological progress increased defensive and offensive capabilities.
 The demands of war and the associated destruction stimulated greater economic activity and spurred organizational innovation, especially for the benefit of those not directly engaged in the conflict.
 Guns were one of the first products of mass production.
 In the modern era, society has become the principle target and victim of war.
 With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, technology and economic activity in support of fighting forces became an increasingly significant factor.
 As a result, more and more effort was directed at eliminating or crippling the enemy’s economic and industrial capacity and the ‘national will’ to wage war.

How dare he!
 How dare he use his kisses to try to keep her from going home!
 It was already hard enough just to look at him in the morning before she walked in the garden.
 He knew that whenever they kissed, she didn't want to stop, that she'd kiss him forever.
 Just last night he'd told her that they couldn't kiss like that unless they got married.
 And this morning he dared to kiss her that way, knowing that it would make her all but forget her walk!
 When she returned to the house nearly half an hour later, she stormed past him and up to her room.
 Rick knew for sure that she was mad this time, knew why, and knew he'd been wrong to do what he'd done.
 "Sweetheart, I'm sorry," he called running after her.
 "I shouldn't have done it.

Spending that much time around you is bound to give me bad habits.”
 She handed over the book.
 Harruq opened it and flipped through the pages.
 Each one depicted various symbols, lines, and curls.
 Aurelia winced at the rough way he handled the paper.
 “What are these?” he asked.
 “The human alphabet.
 And you’re going to learn it.”
 He protested, but it was a weak protest.
 They went over the alphabet several times until Harruq could repeat most without thinking too hard.

“Nothing like home, eh?” he said.
 “Move, before the meat spoils,” Qurrah said.
 The big half-orc stepped out of the way.
 Qurrah came through, carrying a slab of meat in his hands.
 He weaved across the missing planks in the floor and sat next to a small circle of stones.
 Above him was a hole in the ceiling for the smoke to escape.
 “Since when has spoiling meat stopped me from eating it?” Harruq asked.
 Qurrah laughed.
 “Which explains so much.”
 Murmuring a few words, he smashed his hands together.

He scanned them for the information he wanted.
 Born 1904, daughter of Jefferson Tranton, one brother .
 .
 .
 The pages hadn't changed since the last time he'd read them.
 There was no mention of her life after age 23.
 He read the material more carefully, and then he reread it.
 He was actually rather relieved that he didn't have to read about her husband and children, but it seemed odd that the pages hadn't changed when she'd gone back.
 He snorted, shaking his head.
 What was really odd was that the pages had changed to begin with, that the information about her marriage had disappeared when she'd walked into 2011.

Are you leaving soon?"
 "In two weeks.
 Marie and I are going to spend three weeks there, and Jefferson and John will drive out on the weekends.
 You could come with them."
 Marie had been looking forward to going to the Cape, but listening to her mother talk about it, she wasn't so sure she was up to going.
 She needed the familiarity of home.
 She went up to her room soon after Tom left.
 She hadn't bought a stuffed animal for Rick's t-shirt, so she spread the shirt over a pillow.
 After she'd changed into a nightgown, she clutched his handkerchief in her fist and sat down in the rocking chair by her bed.
 She wished she'd gone to the library today--she'd like to have something to occupy her mind.

Especially bracelets."
 She watched in fascination as he talked a merchant down to $8.00 from his asking price of $20.00 for a delicate silver bracelet.
 “We never do that when we shop in Boston.” He laughed.
 “Only when you’re shopping for cars.
 But in Mexico and a lot of other countries, it’s the custom.” “Thank you,” she said as he fastened the bracelet on her wrist.
 "Can I try negotiating for something?"
 "Sure.
 What would you like to buy?"
 They wandered around, and what caught her eye was not all the silver, gold, turquoise, and leather that the natives thought an American tourist would want but the colorful things like serapes and bajas--Mexican blankets and pullover jackets.
 She found a pink and turquoise baja that she fell in love with.

His spell took in this life energy through his hand, filling his body with it, healing his wounds and clearing his mind.
 The darkness fighting for control in his head subsided, a shred of strength returning to his limbs.
 There was still the slight problem of the arrow lodged in his throat.
 Qurrah had a solution but it was far from pleasant.
 Most likely he would die, but he had to try.
 He heard no screams coming from around the corner, but he knew that meant nothing.
 He had to believe his brother was still alive.
 He had to help him.
 Qurrah took out his last healing potion, popped the cork, and then held it before him.
 Blood was beginning to fill his throat once more.

 But I felt comfortable tonight.

 "So did I."
 Rick opened her car door.

 How about tennis--do you like tennis?"
 "Afraid not.
 I'm not much of an athlete."
 "How about brunch and a movie then?"

Emily twirled her hair, “I know but I’m just curious.” I bit my lip.
 “If we do end up fighting this guy, you’ll get your wish.” Minutes later, Jason emerged from the trees and dropped his travel bag on the ground.
 He leaned against the statue next to Emily, giving us both feeble smiles.
 “So,” he said, trying to sound happy, “travel day today, huh?” We didn’t answer.
 “Okay looks like I’ll do the talking,” Jason said.
 “You two excited?” Emily shook her head.
 “No, Jason we’re both jumping for joy, but it’s so deep down that instead we both look like we want to slug you,” I said sarcastically.
 Jason sighed, “Okay, you would say something like that.
 I thought in a mood like this you would be less…annoying.” As soon as he finished his sentence, I wacked him as hard as I could.
 Seth showed up after that, placed his bag on the ground, leaned on the statue next to me, and didn’t say a word.

Their saviors were men, orc, and elf, but they were dead.
 “Ashhur help us,” an exhausted farmer murmured before the line advanced upon them.
 The Forest Butcher at their heels, they could not run.
 Velixar’s army of undead tore the seven apart and cast their remains to the dirt.
 So ended the last life of Cornrows.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 Harruq halted before the mess that had been his prey.
 The line of undead stood motionless, their unfocused eyes looking nowhere.
 The wind blew through them, shifting their hair and whistling through the holes in their bodies.

There were many sad passages after the passing of the writer’s mother, though their bond didn’t seem traditional.
 It seemed more… formal.
 And there were many complaints about the additional workload, both with the castle duties—which were described in more detail—and her training.
 I couldn’t be sure how much time had passed without the entries being dated, but her mood had definitely shifted.
 Father has been merciless in my practice and testing with Rune.
 Unrelenting sessions are wearing on me.
 I can barely concentrate.
 I don’t have the energy for the simplest tasks, let alone the new and wild trials he’s created.
 He thinks he has to test every possible idea he has or else he won’t know what I might be capable of.
 He’s gone much more often lately, but Rune doesn’t let up in his absence.

“Helga, last night I took your advice.
 I said, ‘God, help me out here.
 Don’t let temptation lure me down to the Inn Spot again.’” Helga beamed, and leaned across the table.
 “You stayed home?
 Tell me you stayed home?” “Well, I stayed home all right, but that’s not the whole story.
 You see, the devil came for me.” “No.” Helga covered her face with both hands and peeked out.
 “Yes ma’am.
 He came right up and knocked on my door.” “But you didn’t let him in?” “Well, I wasn’t going to, but one look at that hunk of a man, and he got me in his spell.
 I hardly remember what happened.
 All I can tell you is, when I woke up in his arms this morning, I jumped out of his clutches and ran straight to here.

As if I cared when some stupid bulb burned out.
 I tried for another fifteen minutes, but once her mind started focusing on a new project, anything less than the domestic version of a tactical nuke had effectively zero chance of catching her attention.
 Apparently someone decided that having my mom completely ignore me in my moment of need was going a little too far on the divine retribution.
 In an effort to try and balance things out the dream angels granted me another vivid dream on Sunday night.
 It was wonderful.
 I got to swim around in the most glorious pond known to man.
 I was somehow faster than normal, and spent what seemed like hours chasing around slivers of light that turned out to be some kind of long, thin fish.
 For perhaps the first time in my entire life I didn't mind at all that I'd ended up in a swimsuit so small I might as well have been wearing nothing at all.
 In fact, the feel of the warm water sliding past my skin was so incredible I almost considered skinny dipping.
 Of course that'd only lasted for about a nanosecond.

And of course, the bathing suit.
 Marie grew warm as she remembered how Rick always stared at her whenever she wore her bathing suit.
 He'd told her she was beautiful and sexy.
 "Marie?"
 "Hmmm?"
 "I asked where you'd like to have lunch."
 "Oh.
 I don't care.
 I'm not very hungry.
 Just a hamburger would be fine."

I expected everyone to jump to their feet and all but run out of the room.
 I didn't expect what I actually got.
 "Who are you and why on earth should we believe you?
 The last thing I want to do is go home and get in trouble for cutting tutoring again."
 I opened my mouth to answer, but words wouldn't make their way past the trembling in my chest.
 I felt tears start threatening to arrive and further humiliate me, but Rachel came to my rescue.
 "She's one of the tutors.
 Patty Sanders, who I happen to know has Mrs. Campbell's class sixth period, just gave her a note.
 Stay if you want, but she's done exactly what she was supposed to."
 I wanted to give Rachel a big hug, or maybe just break into tears right then and there.

It was just like Mom to misplace something important like that.
 I opened my mouth to agree with her, but stopped before the words could fully form.
 I didn't know much, but fraud wasn't the kind of thing you associated with a slap on the wrist.
 If the worst happened and Mom was going to serve jail time then we had bigger problems than even what she was admitting to.
 ** It looked like the sun must have set hours ago, but it wasn't really dark.
 The full moon seemed oddly brighter than normal, edging the landscape with a silvery tracing.
 The cool illumination was strangely complemented by the warm tendrils of light trying to escape from the greenery surrounding the area.
 I let my gaze drop, and found an unearthly pool of liquid light at my feet.
 The quiet murmur of falling water to my right kindled a burning thirst I hadn't realized I'd been feeling since I opened my eyes.
 Looking towards the waterfall, I found a shimmering ribbon of light working its way down the rock face.

You don’t understand…” Something flickered in his eyes.
 “Besides, they are pursuing me.
 For choking the tracker.” Grey shook his head.
 “Because of me,” I argued.
 “And now you’ve killed one.” But I didn’t know who had killed him.
 Anvil had stood before the man, but any one of them could have snapped his spine.
 “Frey.” Chevelle’s tone was solemn.
 “You know what they did to your mother.” And I could hear what he didn’t say.
 You know what they’ll do to you.
 I didn’t have a counter for that and he knew it.

Not to mention that marked police cars are waiting within striking distance of the retail center.
 I know the cops can hear everything I say so I spare them my nervous singing and limit my comments, fighting my compulsion to curse wickedly at them.
 I’m staring off across the wetlands, connecting with known drug dealers, talking to undercover narcotics officers on my personal cell phone, feeling a wire taped to my body and extending up to my neck, holding a bottle filled with one hundred Oxys in my jacket pocket.
 What brought me here?
 Where did things get so completely fucked up?
 Chapter 8: Boy Meets World I officially moved out of my parents’ home when I was 15 years old, 35 years ago.
 I didn’t have a driver’s license yet, but I had a learner’s permit.
 I had no car and I walked, bummed a ride or hitchhiked if I needed to get someplace like work or high school.
 It was not easy living on my own and finding roommates at such a young age, but I managed.
 After a short stint of crashing on couches or extra bedrooms of several friends, I rented a room at a house with some other kids near my age.

I’m not going to hurt you.
 You-you don’t know how to get home, do you?”  When she didn’t respond, he said, “Just come look at my newspaper.
 You don’t have to come inside.
 Just sit on my veranda, and when the fog lifts, we’ll-we’ll see if we can find your house.” Afraid of becoming even more lost, she hesitantly followed him to some chairs and perched on the edge of one.
 The man ran inside, and before she could decide whether it was better to wait or leave, he’d returned with a newspaper.
 Marie read one headline: "Obama Popularity Index Declining."
 Neither the words nor the picture meant anything to her.
 Then she checked the date: May 22, 2011.
 She raised her eyes to the man's.
 "This is a joke."

It wasn't a masculine color by almost any standard, but he made it his, and there wasn't anything about him that could be described as anything other than manly.
 Having stalled as long as I could, I finally looked up past his perfect lips and met his twinkling eyes.
 A smile tugged at the corner of his mouth as he walked towards me, and it wasn't until he stopped and held out his hand that I realized it hadn't been empty this whole time.
 "Rachel said you needed some shoes."
 While I was still struggling to get thoughts to coalesce into words, Alec smoothly went down onto one knee, and picked up my left foot.
 The work of art he slipped onto my foot was so beautiful I felt bad letting it touch the ground.
 I held it up for a second, admiring the way the lights played off its gentle curves while I convinced myself nobody was going to throw me into jail for defiling it by using it for its intended function.
 Glass, or possibly something else perfectly transparent.
 It was hard to tell for sure what it was from so far away, but it wasn't plastic.
 The cool ovals where the sole had been cut away to reveal the material underneath told me that much.

She gave me my first head.”  (laughs)  And I was voted, of course, “most talented.”  But, I’ve skipped ahead.
 We should spend more time in high school, if you know what I mean.
 It’s when I cut my teeth, honed my personality, became, for better or worse, what I became.
 Do you wanna start back in ninth grade now?
 CM:  	Sure.
 Yes.
 Exactly.
 I think when you were in ninth grade you were already something of a legend in Memphis Music circles.
 You’d already been sanctified by Jim Dickinson himself.
 Am I right?

The idiot ran off.
 Seth pushed himself up at a surprising speed and raced off into the woods.
 I did the crazy thing that people like me would do and followed him.
 I looked over my shoulder to see if Emily and Jason were coming but both of them stared at me, baffled.
 Their faces disappeared as I was swallowed by the trees.
 I skidded to a halt and scanned the trees.
 I didn’t see any trace of where Seth could have ran.
 That shows how much I know about asking questions.
 I don’t get the answers and boom; I lose it and become a demanding person.
 I walked more slowly, watching the trees.

"Did you have a good day?
 I haven't seen that many people here ever."
 If there was one thing that'd always pissed me off, it was people who refused to own up to their mistakes.
 In my mind not being where you said you were going to be, especially after being so jazzed about it previously, fit into that category.
 Rachel wasn't making a good start.
 "Why don't we cut to the chase, Rachel?
 You didn't go to Les Misérables.
 We spent more than a week planning what we were going to do on the way up and the way back, and you didn't bother to show up."
 Rachel's mouth opened and closed a few times.
 She looked around, but we weren't the only two people in the room.

The last pages were lists of clan members in order of family names.
 There must have been thousands, but still pages were missing… F… G… L… N… V… As I reached the end, I took a deep breath.
 I had gotten so involved in the terrified man’s story and page after page of family names, I had forgotten why I was reading in the first place.
 I sighed.
 Of course, the pages with the V names were missing.
 I felt a stab of guilt for the selfishness of the thought while looking over such loss, but I waved it away and tucked the pages under my mattress.
 Lying back on the bed as I looked up at my mother’s pendant, I closed my eyes, trying to remember… I could see her face.
 Her straight nose, her gentle smile.
 Her long hair waved around her shoulders, stray locks caught by the wind.
 She wore a white dress with bell sleeves and a low-cut neck.

“Do we leave the bodies here?” Harruq asked.
 The necromancer trotted over to the dead noble and did not answer.
 Instead, he ruffled through the silk robes until he found a scroll marked with the seal of the king.
 Qurrah ripped it to shreds and let the pieces scatter in the wind, then he turned to his brother.
 “Do you remember what our Master wanted?”
 Harruq unsheathed Condemnation and nodded.
 “Aye, I do,” he said.

 [section break](break.png)
 When they returned to where Velixar waited, Harruq dropped the head of the noble.

Aurelia tried to say something, tried to comfort him, but no noise came from her throat.
 She was dying.
 “No!” Harruq shouted.
 He pulled out one of his healing potions, yanked off the cork, and forced the contents down Aurelia’s throat.
 The elf gagged, retching up half of it onto her neck and chest.
 Harruq got out his last potion but could not open it for the shaking of his hands.
 Desperate, he put it down, picked up one of his swords, and shattered the top of the vial.
 He flung the potion back to Aurelia’s mouth, nearly shredding her lower lip on the broken glass.
 More of the silvery-blue liquid poured down her throat.
 Harruq sat there, clutching her hands in his and waiting.

“Seth how’d you do that?” I asked.
 He whirled around.
 “Who’s there?” “Me, you idiot!” I snorted.
 He stared at the place where I was standing, but his eyes weren’t focused on me.
 “Jazell?” “Obviously, are you blind?” “I can hear you but can’t see you.
 Aren’t you back?
 Where are you?” “No.” I said frustrated, “Now tell us how you got back.” He closed his eyes and sat down.
 “I imagined myself in my body, and what is was like to be back.
 And then I was back to normal.
 Wait.” The wind picked up around him and then suddenly he was back, blue hair and all, standing beside his sitting, normal body.

Jason walked the rest of the way up the hill and bent over to catch his breath.
 “We've been walking all day and you're not tired?” “Nope, I've got dancer muscles.” Jason sat on the ground.
 “Well, I have artist muscles and those are in my hands.” Emily rolled her eyes.
 “Then walk on your hands.” “No way!” he said.
 “Fine, then don't complain.” She climbed into a small tree that was near the cliff she had spotted.
 She leaned back and let out a sigh of relief.
 Her legs were killing her but she wasn't going to tell Jason that.
 He got up and sat at the base of the tree.
 “You had to take the good tree?” She motioned around.
 “There are plenty of trees to pick from Jason.

I couldn’t bring myself to look away from him, but I saw Rune standing in my peripheral vision.
 I was caught.
 I frantically searched for some explanation.
 But he didn’t speak.
 He flipped his arm, dismissing me.
 The tension showed in that small movement and I blanched.
 I started to pull away from the guard but he didn’t release me.
 I realized then I hadn’t been dismissed.
 It had been a direction for the guard.
 He wrenched me beside him, jerking unnecessarily, and then shoved me through the door to my room.

I started work half an hour early, and Albert, Peter and Mrs. Campbell all stayed an extra forty-five minutes.
 I was helping out an undersized freshman who was having a really hard time understanding the fundamental concepts of the unit she was going to be tested over tomorrow when Mrs. Campbell stopped by.
 "We're all done.
 Wait until the end of your normal shift, and then go home.
 If anyone complains feel free to suggest that they don't leave it until the last minute next time."
 There was plenty of grumbling when I announced that the lab was over, but nobody actually said anything.
 Rachel was waiting for me at the door as everyone else filed out.
 She looked up guiltily as I made my way over to her.

But security only exists as a craving.
 Even though the college in Chico gave me tenure, so they couldn’t have fired me unless I kidnapped the president or his wife or daughter, I had to leave it behind because Laura and I split apart and my kids, whom I loved more than life, health, art or anything, went to live in San Diego.
 I tried commuting (1000 mile weekend trips) for a while but, feeling what I imagine was a similar emptiness to that of Mexicans who labor up here for their families in Mexico, I chucked the best job I’ll probably ever have and returned to San Diego.
 In those first years back, the times I lived for were coaching Cody and the team during practices and ball games at Kuhlken Field, home of La Mesa National Little League.
 Named after my dad since he had been president and organized the renovation of the field.
 During our games, pulling for Cody, I came to understand why a father I knew dropped dead in the stands, when his heart failed while his son was pitching.
 As teenagers, my kids carried on the family tradition of abject rebellion, to the degree that I wrote a Reader story about the Tough Love group I was attending weekly.
 The year my kids began to climb out of the mud, I met Pam.
 * Back when I had only one child, someone told me that two was as easy or easier than one.
 Whoever said that ought to be gagged.

 It was going to get dark soon.
 He looked up at me through his hair.
 I could see the curved end of his lip, which met he was smiling.
 “Do we ever know, Jazell?” “Good point.” *** Emily couldn't sleep.
 She kept closing her eyes but it didn't seem like a time to sleep.
 She wanted to do something, just to occupy her busy mind.
 She watched a strange creature fly over to her tree and hook itself on a branch near her.
 It looked like a butterfly with only one set of wings, which were transparent and seemed to glow.
 It had a tail and curled around the branch so it could rest its middle.

Twenty per cent of all full-time US workers have incomes that fall below the official poverty line for a family of four, though only a quarter of these live in households whose total income is below the poverty line.
 Real wages in the United States have not risen significantly over the last 20 years due to the dramatic increase in the supply of labour as a result of a 62 per cent increase in female participation since 1960 and the entrance of the baby-boom generation into the workforce.
 However, America’s ‘family living standard’ has still risen by 40 per cent since 1970.
 Within the next decade, the aging of the population is expected to reduce job pressures and even lead to labour shortages in some European countries.
 Job growth has been quite rapid in the developing countries over the last forty years, more than doubling total employment.
 The single most important factor behind rising numbers of unemployed persons and increasing absolute numbers of families below the poverty line in developing countries has been the 2.4-fold expansion of population in the Third World, and more than doubling of the economically active population since 1950, which have resulted in a 4 per cent decline in the overall employment rate.
 Population growth rates continue to fall steadily in most countries, with the exception of Africa, providing an opportu nity for economic growth and job growth to catch up with the population explosion of recent decades.
 Along with rapid quantitative job growth, the global economy has achieved dramatic qualitative gains in the nature of employment.
 During recent decades, there has also been a marked movement away from subsistence level manual occupations, primarily in agriculture, to more skilled and remunerative forms of employment.
 Worldwide, the percentage of the work force engaged in agriculture has fallen by 24 per cent since 1950, from 67 to 51 per cent.

 Aurelia grabbed his sleeve to halt him.
 “First, who is your brother?
 Second, since when are you elvish?”
 The half-orc chuckled, but still kept his eyes downward.
 “Our mum was an orc.
 Dad was an elf.
 Never met dad, and mum sold Qurrah and me when we were both little.
 I ran away and lived on the streets of Veldaren.
 Found Qurrah about a year or two later, hiding in the streets after he escaped his master.

 If you're finished, I'll take you upstairs."
 Although it was summer, he decided he'd better dig out the shirt to the winter pajamas his mother had bought him.
 It was thicker than a summer shirt and would give her a greater sense of modesty.
 Still, she stared at the shirt in her hand before raising her eyes to his.

“It’s fine,” he said.
 He released me and I turned to see who he’d addressed.
 Four figures stood in a line, almost a formation, and they relaxed at his words.
 My arm tingled as the blood returned to the limb, freed of his harsh grip.
 Yes, he hates me.
 I flexed my fist.
 “Ah, she escaped,” Ruby purred.
 “And you didn’t trust me with her.” The formation broke as Steed came to stand beside me, the corner of his mouth tipping into a grin.
 I stared at the group.
 I had no idea who they were, but from the way they spoke it was apparently no secret I was Chevelle’s prisoner.

“And I think I will keep any answers that I figure out to myself for now.” “You are not Gerald though are you?” asked the AElf maiden.
 “Not to ask a dumb question,” Rodregas asked in a curious tone “but who is Gerald?”  Silence followed his query but finally he got an answer.
 “He is the man that you appear to be, whose body you now… have,” responded the maiden.
 “And what are you five named?” Rodregas asked.
 There was a pause at his question.
 He knew this was an important moment because once people say who they are they are much less likely to do violence.
 Rodregas did not understand the reason, but he knew that to be true.
 “I am Imeralda,” said the AElf maiden.
 Then came the Hellborn, “My name is Doi’vanaomeraldioan, but humans usually call me Doi’van,” he stated in a slow careful way in a very deep, deep voice.
 The leader, after a pause, said, “I am Audrian of family Corin.” The other two men identified themselves as Brit and Geor.

“That is not a bad idea, while the Guild will be on the hunt for you, they would not expect you to be in such an event, and you will be surrounded by other warriors.
 They would have no room to suspect you.” “There are a few problems.
 I would need to show proof that I was a squire, which I have,” said Rodregas.
 As he spoke he reached into his pouch and pulled out his old Squire patch.
 He showed them the old beaten cloth, the one memento that he had taken with him from his old life.
 The only problem would be if someone asked too many questions about when and where he had trained.
 “It might not work,” said Rodregas.
 “but I think it worth the effort to try.” Doi’van nodded but said, “It is a worthy goal, but what of me?
 The knighthood is mostly a human thing; Hellborn especially will not be welcome to attend the event.” Rodregas nodded but said, “If you are ok with calling yourself and acting as my sworn man,  you could enter the Cathedral and stay with me.
 They won’t be happy about it, but they cannot challenge who I bring with me.” “I would love to figure out a way to smuggle you into the room of the sigils, not likely… but something we can check out,” Rodregas added.

"No.
 I can't explain it--I don't believe in such things.
 But if you're not playing a joke, you've somehow come 84 years into the future."
 She shook her head.
 "Such a thing isn't possible.

I didn't get much sleep last night.
 But I'd rather talk."
 "All right."
 Arm in arm they returned to the living room and sat on the sofa.
 "Can you tell me anything about what happened, darling?
 If you were hurt or starved?"
 Marie sighed, wishing she could tell her mother everything.
 But she'd think that Marie had been so traumatized that she'd lost her grip on reality.
 "I wasn't hurt or starved.
 In fact, I was treated very well."

Brandon was one of the small fish that Steve provided information on.
 Brandon had become so addicted that he could no longer supply the drug in quantity because he and Tiffanie consumed over $1000 a day by snorting or smoking it.
 Brandon had gone from a large dealer to a junkie who would do anything, say anything and sell anything to get his next fix.
 Brandon had become dispensable to Steve and the other large dealers, as he was now an Oxy addicted con man in constant search of his next dose of this potent drug.
 Brandon could trade prison for setting up the double-crosser Steve.
 Officer White was insistent that the time frame for this deal was short.
 Brandon was very ill detoxing, and the fact that he had been busted and he was on lockdown at his parents’ house was common knowledge on the street.
 There’s no easy way to bluff if everyone sees your cards.
 Officer White cooked up a scheme.
 He gave Brandon a phone number and a story for him to give to Steve.

Art – Of course I’m sure.
 Do I have to be sure?
 What will I wear?
 Jim – It usually helps to know for certain what you want.
 At least that’s the advice that you’ve given to me for the last ten years.
 Art – I mean I haven’t been on a date in over twenty years.
 I don’t have a clue what I should wear on a first date.
 Jim – Why don’t you just go in the same kind of thing you’re wearing now?
 Art – Won’t she think that I’m a slob?
 Jim – Why are you asking me that?

 before you go?"
 "No, thank you.
 I'm not hungry."
 Rick hesitated at the kitchen door, glancing at Marie.
 He wanted to beg her to stay with him, to get down on his knees if he had to, cry, plead.
 But that would just make both of them miserable.
 She'd already made her decision.
 He led her into the garden.

He had two very nice bows wrapped up in the wagon.
 But, while the short swords he handed them were dangerous, they were common and easy to replace.
 On the other hand, the Black Yew bows were rare and powerful.
 He also thought about the chain mail that he had found in Ravenhurr’s wardrobe.
 While it was way too small to fit him it would fit Imeralda just fine.
 But to give this woman he barely knew such fine armor and weapons was not something to do casually.
 It made a lot of sense sitting there on the foothills of the Arida Mountains, worrying about Gobelyn and Dire Cat attacks, but they were a great gift; no one had ever given him such a gift.
 “What?” she asked me “You are looking at me like I asked you for your first born child,” she stated in a surprised voice.
 “Last night you two tried to kill me, I thought I was being very generous to share my hideout and give each of you a sword.
 Frankly I am worried that you will both give it back to me when I am sleeping tonight.” Imeralda looked surprisingly guilty, Doi’van looked... well Rodregas could not guess what the expression on his blunt rough face meant.

But no they’re not complete morons, they’re quite handy to when it comes to making the clock on the video recorder stop blinking 12:00 for all eternity.
 But when it comes to important things, like knowing what a woman wants, well they’re hopeless.
 Even on the rare occasions that they actually are paying one hundred percent attention to us, which doesn’t happen as often as it should.
 They’re just simple minded, and it’s better that you learn than now than later.
 Otherwise you might end up like me, and that doesn’t seem to appeal to you very much.
 Liz – (A slight warming) Thank you for the advice, I’ll try to keep it in mind when I deal with men.
 Cleo – My pleasure baby, it’s the only motherly thing I can pass on to you.
 Well I must be going now.
 I have some ‘chores’ to see to.
 Liz – Good-bye mother, stay out of trouble.

Hiking maybe?
 Only I could count the number of hikes I'd actually participated in on one hand.
 Surely something like that would've stayed with me.
 Someone gasped as the crowd shifted around, distracting me from my half-formed suspicions.
 I looked over at the exterior wall of the school and felt my jaw drop.
 Maybe Mom had read the story about the three little pigs a few too many times to me when I was growing up, but I'd always thought of brick as the strongest possible building material.
 I didn't have any idea if it really was, but it seemed incredible that anything could've wreaked such damage.
 The bricks on the wall next to the door were cracked and set back in the wall, almost like they'd been hit with some kind of wrecking ball, and the concrete of the sidewalk had gouges crisscrossing its surface like some kind of abstract painting.
 "There's nothing to see here, kids.
 I want you to all disperse and go to your home rooms."

Another twist.
 Qurrah leaned forward, clutching at his tormenter’s shaking hands.
 Words spilled from the half-orc’s mouth, garbled and nearly unintelligible.
 “What is it you wish to say to me?” the elf asked, ignoring the flailing hands that pawed at his face.
 “ _Hemorrhage,_ ” the half-orc hissed.
 The elf’s face exploded.
 Qurrah fell over onto his side, breathing as slowly as he could through the blood that filled his throat.
 The dead body of the elf crumpled in front of him, all of his hate-filled features gone from his face except for a single eye.
 The half-orc stared, wondering if his brother was truly dead.
 Darkness crept at the corner of his sight.

Rodregas could almost smell the fire and brimstone.
 Rodregas met Doi’van’s smile with a smile of his own.
 He reached out and grabbed Doi’van’s forearm and gripped it in the handshake of warriors and said, “You have spoken to me honestly.
 I will honor that with my own honesty.
 I don’t know exactly how I ended up in this body, but I do know that I killed Ravenhurr, and I killed his bastard assistant, Korin.
 The Immortalists are a sore on the world.
 Their use of others’ bodies and power and their very way of life is abhorrent.” Rodregas looked Doi’van in the eyes and said, “The name I was born with is Rodregas.
 When I decided to kill Ravenhurr, I promised the gods that if they let me survive, I would take on the duty of killing the Immortalists.
 It is a duty that I know will end in my death.
 There are hundreds of Immortalists.

The slope started to even out more and the trees popped up again.
 Be careful.
 I stopped.
 The voice had come out of nowhere.
 The time is near.
 The voice whispered as faintly as the breeze.
 What, I thought, was that?
 You must stop it.
 I gritted my teeth in annoyance.
 I’m sick and tired of your riddles, whoever you are.

Jim – See you at the show.
 (goes back to reading his comic book)
 Scene 2
 Later that day.
 An art gallery.
 Several pedestals with ‘art’, one being a cardboard box supposedly filled with ceramic pieces.
 And several paintings are on display.
 The art work all has spotlights on it, in addition to the regular lighting.
 Several people are looking at the creations and acting like they are holding conversations as they move about and look at the exhibit.
 Liz and her mom are speaking apart from the crowd.

Marie glanced down at herself self-consciously.
 "You said that this was very modest."
 "It is."
 "Then why are you looking at me like that?"
 He swallowed.
 "I've never seen anyone who looks as good as you in one."
 She smiled then, reaching for his hand.
 "Come on--let's go."
 "Wait.
 You need to put on shorts and a shirt over your bathing suit."

I felt the steady thump under my fingers and I sighed in relief.
 I removed my hand and looked over at Emily.
 They had freed the dragon and they both were petting its head.
 It stretched its wings and they both had to duck to avoid being hit.
 “Seth,” I whispered, “this is what I meant when I said things would get bad if we didn't tell them.” I looked back at my two friends, who were laughing.
 “I mean they are our friends, best buds, you get my drift.
 I understand that you're scared and worried but so am I. I'm scared that if I'm the only one who knows about this, I won't be enough to help you.” “Jazell, I understand now.
 I'm sorry I was such a jerk, I should have listened to you.” I turned back around to see Seth's eyes watching me.
 He was clutching his head and groaning.
 I gave him a hand and he grabbed it.

While data on unemployment levels in most developing countries is of doubtful accuracy and recent data are difficult to obtain, there is no question that the problem remains severe, especially among youth and the educated.
 ILO estimated that at the end of 2000 approximately 110 million workers in developing countries, excluding Central and Eastern Europe, were unemployed, most of them first-time jobseekers.
 Unemployment rates among young workers are almost everywhere at least twice as high as the average.
 In addition another 500 million workers in the developing world earned less than a dollar a day.
 Although the growth rate of the world's labour force is slowing down, approximately 460 million additional jobseekers will enter the global labour force between 2000 and 2010, two-thirds in Asia.
 ILO has concluded that the prospects for an improving global employment situation depend mainly on continued expansion of the world economy.
 While that expansion is likely, economic growth alone will not be sufficient to provide opportunities for sustainable livelihood for all those who need it.
 Jobs or livelihood for all must be the bottom line of all development, technological and trade policies.
 It will be necessary for governments to elevate employment to the top of their policy agenda and dedicate themselves to the vital task of achieving full employment.

She could draw her own conclusions about what the change in the article meant.
 Excited, he stood and headed for her room.
 But when he reached her door, he hesitated.
 Would she believe him about the article?
 She still felt loyal to that jerk, and she might not believe him.
 Especially since it was pretty obvious that he himself had something to gain by convincing her that she shouldn’t marry Davis.
 His sister had once told him that a girl usually wouldn’t even believe her best friend if she told her that her boyfriend was cheating on her.
 He went back to his office and read the article again.
 He should have shown it to Marie before he’d fallen in love with her.
 But he was afraid to tell her he’d known of her before she’d walked into the garden.

Yeah, so I had that in my hand.
 And there was Dylan with a copy of Teeth Mother Naked at Last.
 And we hugged and, man, it was like, I was set loose.
 I was exonerated for all past sins.
 Dylan knew the writers, you know, he and Ginsberg and the rest of them.
 He was meeting Ferlinghetti there at City Lights and Larry brought Michael and we all just kind of hit it off—you gotta know these guys, I mean, this is what’s real, you know, this, what you can hold in your hand, that’s the kind of guys these guys are.
 You take a book, you can hold it in your hand, and it’s like, it’s already communicating with you, before you even open it.
 And these guys, these poets, man, they are just so honorable.
 And City Lights is a halidom, right?
 You’ve been there?

 Eugene – Non-believer.
 It’ll work.
 It’s a well know fact that Godzilla is feared by millions of Japanese people.
 Jim – Right…and where did you hear that fact?
 Hmmmm?
 You haven’t been buying tabloids again have you?
 Eugene – I never bought tabloids.
 That would be stupid.
 I stole them, or just read them in the checkout line.

I mean, c’mon.
 Have you read “The Waste Land?”  Jesus.
 You know, I love “Day in the Life.”  Shit.
 It doesn’t get much better than that, pop music-wise.
 “I read the news today oh boy” is just about the finest first line I’ve ever heard.
 I’d kill to have written that one line.
 But, does it compare to “April is the cruelest month?” Or “Turning and turning in the widening gyre?”  Or even, “Something there is that does not love a wall?”  No, of course not.
 And John would tell you the same thing.
 I’m not putting down The Beatles, hell, McCartney and Lennon are the greatest songwriting team of all time.
 No question.

Pick up the phone at any table, dial the two digit number of the table you wanted to connect with and there you have it: a coward’s way of asking a lady to dance or talk without getting shot down tableside.
 What can I say?
 This was the style at the time.
 I was sitting at the bar with Bill, just a twenty-two year old kid, when a vision walked in.
 She stopped just a few steps inside the door.
 She wore purple high waist pants and a cream colored blouse that went all the way to her neckline with ruffled edges framing her stunning face.
 Her long blond hair flowed down to her shoulders.
 If I could put a caption over her head, it would have read, “If you talk to me, I will kill you.” She looked completely out of place, and her blue eyes lit up the room.
 Her silent stare suggested that she was not there to be picked up or even approached.
 She was not the typical girl entering an 80’s bar and dance club.

He was out of control.
 I think he’s still trying to worm his way into the music business—I don’t really know.
 But he didn’t know a fucking thing about music or the business and he wanted a part of Black Lung, because it looked like we were the next Cream, the next Experience, the next Mountain.
 Whatever.
 He just wanted a slice of the pie, man.
 And I was like, I throw my hands up, just let me record and keep me away from the jackals, you know?
 But, well, eventually, I had to get Pete.
 Pete was Jim Dickinson’s friend.
 Jim’s a pure soul, a force for good, the Wise Man of the Forest, you know?
 He told me once, “Watch out for that shithead, Hudson.

The crest of Neldar adorned their tabards.
 Longswords hung from their belts.
 “Me be Harruq Tun!” the half-orc said as he stepped further into the light, grinning stupidly.
 “And this be me brother, Qurrah!”
 “Get back you smelly thing,” the other guard said.
 Both stood to face him as other guards stirred from their blankets and bedrolls.
 They still wore their chainmail, proof something had disturbed them greatly.
 Sleeping in armor was far from comfortable.
 “Me only a little smelly,” Harruq slurred.
 “Do you have any food, me be starving, and me brother no be feelin’ too good.

Marshal Faurrenida laid the sword on Rodregas’ right shoulder and said, “Squire, you come to us this day.
 Think well and be sure on your decision to swear these oaths.” Faurrenida paused for a second and then slowly added.
 “Will you swear to uphold the Rules of Chivalry, to serve the Order of the Soaring Heavens with honor, and to serve as the Champion of the Celestials on this World if called to be a Paladin?” “My Lord Grand Marshal, I so swear in the name of the Celestial Gods.” Strangely, instead of being excited, he felt tired.
 In some ways he was adding another burden and it was heavy.
 “Arise, Sir Rodregas, Knight of the Soaring Heavens and be made welcome in the Cathedral of the Heavens.” Applause filled the room, though it was muted.
 Rodregas looked for Doi’van and Imeralda and he was sad to see that they had not been there to share his moment.
 Van’dret at least had left.
 The next few hours went by quickly.
 He was introduced to many people.
 It was late as the other knights went to find sleep when both Doi’van and Imeralda suddenly both appeared.

Chapter 19 It seemed like the old karmic scale was still going strong and trying very hard to make up for how great Les Misérables had been.
 We finally arrived in town after way too many hours of driving and then I had to wait for Mom to come pick me up.
 The last chaperon had been about five minutes from throwing in the towel and just taking me home herself by the time Mom finally pulled into the school parking lot.
 Mom hadn't even apologized.
 She'd mumbled something about needing to hit one of her 'close' sites while the moon was still high in the sky as she dropped me off at home and then drove off without looking back.
 I'd just managed to drop off into a fitful sleep when she came back home and ruined any chance of me catching up on the sleep I'd missed because of the trip.
 I'd never been able to go back to sleep after being woken up in the morning, but I tried anyways.
 By the time I finally gave up and got out of bed I was not a happy camper.
 I was even less so by the time Mom finally woke up.
 Rachel not having been at Les Misérables had been preying on my mind the whole time I'd been studying, and since Brandon wouldn't work for girl talk, I needed to hash it all out with my mom.

It did seem like it wasn't quite as hot though.
 Maybe it was getting late enough in the year to bring the temperatures down slightly.
 It was too much to hope it would actually drop to the low seventies, even when December came around.
 I made it down the lane and then started worrying.
 It was like I couldn't win.
 If Britney drove all the way out here and I was already gone because I'd taken the bus, she was going to be really mad.
 On the other hand, if she didn't show, I had no other way to get to school, and Mom would freak out.
 Part of the reason she felt like she could be gone so much ever since the accident was the fact that I always did the responsible thing.
 If she started thinking I was cutting class, she was going be furious.
 It would be like I was behaving irresponsibly and taking away her ability to pursue her art, all at the same time.

Johnny – I think it’s because you ate lead paint as a child.
 Eugene – I’d have to agree with Johnny, lead paint isn’t good for you.
 Jim – You knew that Elizabeth felt something for me, and you didn’t say anything, what kind of friend are you?
 Johnny – Maybe he’s Elizabeth’s friend more than he’s your friend.
 If that’s the case he might have wanted to spare her from a lifetime of living with you.
 Jim – What do you know about it?
 Johnny – I’ve lived with you for a lifetime.
 Nobody should have to go through that.
 Eugene – And Elizabeth seems to want that kind of fate.
 Johnny – I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again, Elizabeth is a strange person.

“Maybe it’s something you should think about.”  He ran his thumb over her lower lip.
 “You deserve better, Marie.”  He tilted her chin up, touching his lips to hers.
 When she didn't pull away, he repeated the feather-light touch.
 He felt her breath, the quivering of her lips.
 He kissed the corner of her mouth and nuzzled her cheek.
 Gathering her closer, he began taking her lips in one soft kiss after another.
 But as her response grew warmer, his kisses became hungrier.
 Marie was growing hot and felt almost drugged by Rick's kisses.
 She ran one hand over his chest, wishing that his shirt had buttons so that she could undo one and slip her hand inside.
 If--oh!

When recognition dawned, I leapt from the rock, cursing Chevelle.
 He turned to me as I yelled, “Give it back!” He didn’t appear to know what I was talking about, but I was so angry I was having trouble forming the demand.
 “Give my memories, my mind back!” His confusion cleared, but Chevelle didn’t offer a response.
 The fire in me itched to burn him.
 I seethed.
 “Unbind my thoughts.” “Freya.” His voice was smooth.
 “You don’t understand.” I fumed, “Well, I’m sure that has nothing to do with you rummaging around in there.” He shook his head and his complete lack of agitation caused me to take pause.
 I supposed it was possible he actually couldn’t free my thoughts.
 If the council had bound me, likely all of them would need to reverse it.
 And they wouldn’t do that.

Information Technology and IT-enabled services stand out as the most important new fields of employment to emerge since the popularization of the automobile.
 While the Commission’s report anticipated the importance of the information superhighway even before the World Wide Web radically transformed global communications, information exchange and commerce, ICPF did not foresee the dramatic impact that the Internet would have on the future export of service jobs to developing countries.
 The West has been exporting manufacturing jobs in large numbers for half a century, fuelling the growth of Japan, the East Asia tigers, and more recently China; but until the emergence of the information superhighway, the scope for export of service jobs was limited.
 Technological development has changed that.
 As a result, business process outsourcing has become one of the fastest growing sectors of the world economy.
 As growth of the labour force slows in high-income countries, there will be increasing pressure for export of service jobs.
 Public concern in the West over the rapid growth of outsourcing is fuelled by the common misconception that employment is a zero sum game.
 A recent authoritative study of the impact of IT outsourcing found that the direct gains to the US economy in the form of additional jobs in other fields, higher real wages, higher real GDP growth, contained inflation and expanded exports far outweigh the losses.
 While global IT software and service outsourcing displaces some IT workers, total employment increases as the benefits ripple through the economy.
 The net additional number of jobs in the USA added as a result of outsourcing is projected to exceed 300,000 by 2008.

Past experience has shown that mere debt rescheduling in these countries does not solve the problem and may in fact aggravate it.
 The extent of the problem is reflected in the heavily discounted prices of the debts of countries with low and lower-middle incomes in the secondary market and in negotiated buy-outs of the debt owed to commercial creditors.
 In 1993, the average market price of the debt was about 30 cents on the dollar.
 This market discount was a major factor in the decision to scale down the debt of Latin American countries by an average of 15 per cent and of Egypt and Poland by 50 per cent.
 The aggregate debt of the 61 debt-affected countries with low and lower-middle income is roughly equal to that of the half-dozen mostly middle-income countries assisted under the Brady Plan.
 Scaling down the debt of these poor countries by an average of 70 per cent would be appropriate in view of their economic plight, though the actual reduction would have to be negotiated on a case by case basis.
 In order to be of sufficient magnitude, debt reduction should be applied to all three major classes of creditors: bilateral official creditors, private sector lenders and international organizations.
 Debt reduction should be linked to each country's specific programmes for poverty eradication and meeting the minimum needs of the people.
 7.Commodity prices: The problem of debt is closely linked to that of international commodity prices.
 The majority of developing countries are dependent on the export of primary products for their welfare and growth.

"Marie," he sighed into her hair.
 She could barely breathe but didn't want to be released.
 When he at last set her down, she continued to cling to him.
 "I wish you didn't have to go to work today."
 He was surprised by her words.
 "Do you want me to call in sick?"
 She drew back to look at him.
 "Would you do that?"
 "If you need me, sure."
 She smiled.

Sounds of surprised yells and sizzling fire filled the alleyway.
 The half-orc lifted his head, gasping at what he saw.
 One of the night patrol stood knee deep in dried mud.
 The other was hanging upside down from a flaming whip that failed to burn him.
 “Get on up, orc,” Aurelia said.
 “Or half-orc, whatever you are.
 I can only keep them like this for a little while.”
 Both men glared at Harruq as he stood, but while their mouths moved and their chests heaved neither produced a sound.
 The half-orc looked to the woman shrouded in the shadows cast by the fallen torch of the patrolmen.
 “I said move along,” she said.

9.Highest priority must be given to controlling and reversing the proliferation of small arms in line with the determined international measures employed to curb hijacking.
 As an immediate first step, these weapons should be classified and a UN register created to monitor their manufacture and sale.
 Agreements should be negotiated between major arms suppliers to severely restrict production and sales.
 Strong sanctions must be instituted to discourage states from actively or passively abetting small arms proliferation, especially to non-state actors.
 10.UN action to curb the international trade in major armaments needs to go further than the existing Arms Register.
 Arms exports to areas identified by the UN as trouble spots should be banned by international law.
 An independent agency should be established to verify the submissions from arms-exporting states.
 Major arms exporters should agree to consult the Security Council in advance about large orders received for destabilizing weapons and, where appropriate, coordinate actions to limit the size of arms transfers.
 11.Narcotic drug production and trafficking must be treated as threats to international peace and security.
 The strongest possible sanctions should be instituted under the UN against countries that permit or support these activities.

Chevelle appeared reluctant to get up.
 For a moment, I thought he might reach out to me, but he only stood and left without another word.
 It ached.
 I didn’t want him to hate me.
 Ruby whirled into the room and grabbed me around the waist from behind, spinning me up, over the back of the seat, and through her door before I could process what was happening.
 She plopped me down in the center of her bed and swung around to sit in front of me.
 My head was reeling from the spin as she smiled at me, waving her hands and bringing a plethora of bottles and canisters flying toward us to drop on the bed.
 I thought with disappointment that I hadn’t responded to her attack as Chevelle had taught me and laughed at the image in my head.
 Ruby gave me a genuine smile as she began twisting the lid on a small metal canister.
 “No mother to teach us the tricks of the trade,” she sighed as she leaned in.

Did he really hate me so much just because I'd told him off about not protecting Rachel?
 Cassie was waiting for me at my locker when I got there.
 "Brandon wanted me to stop by and let you know he had a few things to take care of, so he won't see you during lunch.
 You can still come sit with us if you want."
 The words were right.
 If I'd been reading them off of a page in a book, I probably would've believed them, but the way she delivered them left no doubt in my mind.
 She didn't want me at their table.
 The only reason she'd stopped by my locker was because Brandon had told her to.
 "Thanks, but I have some studying to do.
 I'd better just find a quiet corner."

He watched the book and, occasionally, when his gaze was on my face, it wandered back up and out of focus, just above me.
 But he did not look directly into my eyes as before.
 It bothered me, and I didn’t think it was because of my conscience.
 When he reached the end of the book, it returned to its home on the shelf and he stood, placing a hand briefly on the top of my head.
 It was only a momentary touch, but electricity surged though me.
 A flash of confusion or frustration passed over his features, too fast to identify.
 He looked into my eyes one last time as I sat, stunned and speechless, my skin still tingling from the contact.
 “Enough for today,” he said, nodding as he turned, his long strides taking him too quick from my view.
 I sat motionless as I watched him go, and remained so for some time after.
 I hadn’t realized how exhausted I’d been.

“It means, 'slayer of worlds'.
 Does that ring a bell?” “How do you know that?” I asked.
 He shrugged.
 “I don't know how, I just do.
 Maybe that's my power.” “Well, I want to go this way,” I said and pointed to the entrance.
 “If something like that is on the entrance, I want to know where this goes.” “I agree but aren't we supposed to be trying to find Emily and Jason?” “I have an idea,” I said and pulled my bow off my back.
 I removed one of my arrows and put my bow on the ground.
 I walked over to Seth and pulled his sword out of its sheath.
 He grabbed for it but I already had it in my hands.
 I put the tip against the arrow and carved the same sign as the one on the wall.

Evolve new organizational patterns for existing industries based on adaptation of new technologies in small, geographically decentralized, labour-intensive production units in order to make these industries more responsive, flexible, efficient and competitive.
 8.Extend basic education: A distinguishing feature of the East Asian countries has been their emphasis during the early stage of industrialization on primary and secondary education, especially in rural areas.
 This strategy increases the productivity of the mass of the workforce, helps promote income equality, consumer spending power and broad support for high growth and pro-business policies.
 Raise the educational qualifications of the workforce to the level pertaining in more economically advanced nations.
 Place particular emphasis on primary and secondary education, rural education and education of young girls.
 9.Disseminate information: Encourage the establishment of new institutions, programmes and systems to speed and extend the dissemination of practically useful information as a powerful catalyst for more rapid social progress.
 Encourage a national climate of open-mindedness to foreign ideas, influences and success stories.
 10.Increase the velocity of money and other transactions: Increase the speed of commercial transactions, especially money flows, in the economy by streamlining government and banking procedures, ensuring rapid utilization of funds by all government agencies, setting strict limits on the time taken for bank transfers, introducing agencies for credit verification and collection of unpaid bills, and improving the telecommunications infrastructure.
 11.Revamp higher education: Educational systems which 'manufacture graduates' compound the problem rather than alleviating it.
 The problem of the educated unemployed is not so much the amount of education they receive, but the type of knowledge and attitudes imparted.

“In my office.” “I want to look at them again to see if I can find something that we missed.” “OK—I’ll help you.” “No.”  She shook her head, glancing at him but unable to meet his gaze.
 “I-I need to do it alone, OK?” “OK.” He watched her go, his heart heavy.
 He couldn’t stand to see her so unhappy, but he didn’t want her to leave.
 He loved her.
 He headed upstairs to make sure she’d found all the books and articles.
 She was coming out of the office with a load of them.
 “I’m going to look at them in my room,” she told him.
 “You can use the office.
 I don’t care.” “No—my room is fine.” The light reflected off her diamond as she turned away from him.
 Rick’s stomach clenched.

He had to admit she had a very nice soft voice to go along with that killer body and exotic look.
 There were three human men, all large and well built, the AElf maiden, and whatever the large man was.
 While the guy that he had tagged as the leader was nearly as tall and well built as Rodregas’ new body, the other two men were also very impressive.
 They were all men that Ravenhurr had been testing for use as replacement bodies.
 Rodregas’ present body had “won” as the most gifted human male that Ravenhurr could find.
 Rodregas now remembered that the very large male was something else: half Orqui and half Infernal Daemon, one of those known as the Hellborn.
 The Hellborn was actually a good head taller than even Rodregas, and even more broad and muscular.
 In fact, his chest was so broad that it looked almost deformed, and something bulged in the middle of both of his shoulders, though the cloak he wore blocked the details of the strange bulge.
 His face was blunt, except for incredibly sharp cheekbones, and his skin had a reddish brown hue.
 His head was crowned with a pair of horns like a goat’s.

“Epic.” “Epic?” Seth scoffed.
 “That’s all you can say?
 This,” he motioned to the dark archway, “can't be described by one word.” I smiled to myself.
 The old Seth seemed to be coming back, which was great.
 I was getting really tired of quiet, watching Seth.
 “Then how about ‘the coolest thing on Earth?’” Jason asked.
 Seth shook his head.
 “No, it’s not even a part of Earth.
 Try creepy, but cool.” Emily rolled her eyes.
 “Boys, I still don’t know how they find this interesting.” She pointed to Jason and Seth, who were continuing to guess random names to describe the arch.

At home after the trip’s longest drive, the whole length of California including the purgatorial L.A. freeways, when Zoë’s grandma leaves I think about waking my girl.
 She has only been asleep a half-hour.
 I decide to only contemplate her face for a minute then leave her be.
 After all, we have years together, God willing.
 But first thing tomorrow, I mean to tell her about my trip.
 Not the whole story.
 She can read that someday.
 I’ll give her a short version, something like this: In a rest stop just north of Yreka, I walk down a hill to a bench where I sit and realize all that stands between me and pure joy, which is the Kingdom of Heaven, is me.
 I watch white birds swooping and hovering over the Klamath River, and I think of their maker.
 Then I watch a family, a couple and two daughters, strolling beside the river.

“It's not fair.” I leaned against the tree next to him and rammed my elbow into his side.
 He winced and I grinned.
 “I didn't ask for the power, Seth.
 But it did save our butts so I'm happy, I magically gained it.” “Well I hope I get some cool power too,” Emily said and stretched.
 “Whatever,” Jason said and twirled a knife in his hand.
 He seemed to go back to say-a-few-words-and-then-say-nothing-which-drives-everyone-crazy.
 Emily made a face at him.
 “Wow, thanks so much for the support, Jason.
 That speech was incredible.” Jason stuck his tongue out.
 “You're welcome.” “One day,” she mumbled.

Rick took her face between his hands, kissing her over and over.
 "I love you so much," he murmured, claiming her mouth again.

 He laughed.
 "Will Monday morning be soon enough?"
 "I don't know."
 She didn't think she could resist his kisses for another second.
 He smiled slightly, stroking her hair.

“He was wrong, obviously.
 Qurrah was stuck talking like that.
 Like a snake hiss or a raspy whisper.”
 “Or a dying man,” Aurelia whispered, so soft that Harruq could not make out her words.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 The streets were all the same to him, so down them all he wandered.
 The image of Aurelia and Harruq danced in his mind, and conflicting feelings rippled through his chest.
 “She seems a kind enough elf,” Qurrah said, talking to himself since he had no company.
 “Beautiful as well.

“You know what I ask of you,” Velixar said.
 “I do,” Qurrah said.
 “I pray I do not disappoint.”
 He closed his eyes, his hands stretched to either side.
 His fingers hooked and curled in strange ways, many times so twisted and odd that Harruq could not bear to watch them dance.
 Words spilled from the frail half-orc’s lips.
 Some were strong, demanding, while others came limping out, twisted in form and barely existing as they were meant to exist.
 The words, however, did not matter as much as the dark power rolling forth from Qurrah.
 His sheer will would determine the full strength of the spell.
 A cold wind came blasting in, seemingly from all directions.

Sighing, she leaned into him as their kiss went on.
 Rick was lost.
 She held nothing back in her kiss, making him hungrier for more.

 She would never have dreamed that being pinned beneath Rick's body would feel so incredibly .

I don’t know how I would try to reach him in your place.
 Just try.
 Jim – As I said, I’ll do what I can.
 But I think he’s going to either end up dead in an ally or in a psycho ward somewhere.
 He still hates mother with all his being.
 Art – She really messed him up, but hopefully we can help him let go, and then heal.
 If we can’t help I’m afraid he might have to go see a psychiatrist.

"I love you, Rick.
 I feel torn apart.
 But I have to go home!"
 Rick drew her into his arms, feeling torn apart himself.
 He couldn't bear the thought of losing her.
 But he hated seeing her miserable.
 "Marie," he said softly, stroking her hair, "you've been here for over five weeks.
 You've walked in the garden almost every morning.

“He and his pride can suck a rotten egg,” Harruq said.
 “Hurry or we’ll miss the battle.”
 He pulled his brother down the alley to where a tall, crumbled house leaned near the wall.
 “Onto my shoulders,” Harruq suggested, grabbing Qurrah’s knees and hoisting him high.
 Qurrah latched onto the roof, paused, and then stepped onto Harruq’s shoulders.
 The extra height boosted his head and chest above the roof, allowing him to climb to the top despite a moment of flailing.
 Harruq clapped for him, and he smiled at the next roar from the orcs.
 It was a goofy smile, and Qurrah recognized the fear hiding behind it.
 “Hurry,” Qurrah said as Harruq climbed, using a windowsill as a foothold.
 Together, they stood upon the roof and gazed over the wall, mesmerized by the sight before them.

Jason moved silently to stand beside us, one of his throwing knives in his hand.
 “What do we do?
 We’re dead so it can’t hurt us right?” I asked.
 “I don’t feel dead.” Jason whispered.
 I didn’t either.
 In fact, I realized that my whole body was aching from the strange attack I had experienced.
 And if I was dead, I wouldn’t need to breathe so heavily.
 My heart was racing so fast that it might explode right out of my chest.
 Jason threw the knife he had been holding and it stuck into a tree.
 He grinned at me and I guess it hit exactly where he wanted.

She agreed and said she would see me soon.
 After I hung up the phone, the officer called me on my personal cell phone, which I was answering from a headset in my ear.
 He offered some encouraging words about how I had handled her attempt to move me and said they would try to move me again because Steve was not going to want to meet me in this county because of his arrangement with the police here.
 We were only a mile from another county line so Officer White and his team felt he would try to get me to move that mile.
 I hung up and the wait began.
 I was all eyes and all ears as the silence in the truck made it too easy for my mind to wander.
 I wasn’t allowed any background noise.
 I was parked at the far end of the lot with the front end of my truck against a fence as I was instructed to do.
 I was impatiently waiting when I finally saw one of the scraggly dressed officers wandered by pushing a grocery basket full of bags looking like a homeless person.
 He had an old torn jacket on with a beanie on his head.

The end of political confrontation between East and West, the sudden conversion of authoritarian communist states into demo cratic market economies, and substantial cuts in global defence spending were accompanied by increasing political instability and ethnic violence in the many parts of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, by the horren dous loss of life due to civil and ethnic strife in several African countries, by growing concern over drugs and violent crime in the West, by the danger of nuclear terrorism resulting from potential theft of Soviet weapons, and by pressure on defence producers to compensate for reduced domestic defence budgets by increasing arms exports.
 This surprising turn of events has led some to re-examine the incredible achievements of the period and conclude that they were either vastly overstated or, perhaps, even illusory.
 Others have come to take these achievements for granted.
 Still others have simply forgotten how much things have really changed.
 But the most important realization to be derived from these events is of the inherent defect in attempts to address the factors underlying international security in a piece meal manner.
 Over the past five years the Commission encountered reminders of this truth in virtually every field that it took up for examination.
 It is this experience that has convinced us of the need for wider perspectives and total solutions.
 The marvellous achievements of the past few years are neither fortuitous nor illusory.
 The Berlin Wall has been brought down and demolished.
 The Iron Curtain has been lifted and obliterated.

It was possible she'd just gone to the restroom.
 I tried to remind myself of all of the places she could be, and all of the reasons she might have left that didn't involve abandoning me here.
 Rachel met me on my way back to my table to gather up my books.
 "She left with Rick Anders."
 I mustered a grin.
 "Was my panic that obvious?"
 "No, I was just watching her to see who she had in her sights for the Ashure Day Dance.
 Then when I saw her leave I realized that would mean you wouldn't have a ride home."
 I put the last couple of books in my backpack and shrugged.
 "I think she's mad.

But that is more of a matter of the rareness of Hellborn, and Nymphs have never shown interest in joining the knighthood.” “While I am still hesitant to say that your cause is mine, I do wish to keep traveling with you two.
 I have always heard stories of the knights and would enjoy visiting the Cathedral.
 It is supposed to be a place of great magic and many myths and stories.” Rodregas nodded, he could not help smiling.
 He enjoyed the company of the two of them.
 It would be good to continue to travel together.
 The next day Imeralda arranged to send a group of fellow Forest Nymphs back to the farm to put a roof on the old farmhouse.
 It was probably not worth the cost of some of their excess equipment and limited gold, but the three of them all had good memories of the farm and liked the idea putting a roof back on the structure.
 The Nymphs with their connection with nature were the only humanoids unlikely to be attacked by the Dire Cats.
 The biggest surprise came when Jordaan came to say goodbye.
 Rodregas had his stuff all spread out in the room he had been using, organizing what would go where.

Stop the presses!
 I sprung up and shook my finger in the air in front of his face.
 “Are you high right now, Brandon?” “Nah.” He looked at his Converse.
 “When was the last time you took Oxy?” No response.
 Brandon shuffled his feet and stretched his spine, scratched the corner of his eye, but as is consistent with his behavior, continued to lie and deny.
 I am shaking my arms and getting down in Brandon’s face.
 I am shouting at his face.
 I am screaming at the shell of my firstborn.
 “Are you high?
 Are you high right now?” Spittle lands on his face; he blinks but does not flinch.

“Well, up to me then.” He took out Condemnation, grinning as the soft red glow lit up his face.
 “Let’s see how strong this girl is.”
 He swung the blade.
 Qurrah closed his eyes and hoped no significant enchantments guarded the fence.
 If any did, they fizzled against the magic of the ancient sword.
 Harruq sliced two of the bars cleanly, and a third dented in enough so that a follow up chop cut it like butter.
 Pleased, Harruq took two of the bars into his hands.
 His neck bulged, his arm muscles tensed, and then the iron screeched backward.
 Both winced at the noise.
 They did not move for the next five minutes.

 Jason threw the knife he had been holding and it stuck into a tree.

 “On the count of three, we attack with everything we’ve got.
 Okay?” Seth looked at Jason and I.
 We nodded at him.
 “One, two three!” When Seth hit three, he charged with his sword.
 I pulled back and released my arrow.
 It hit the thrasher’s front paw.

I just said it because a father does whatever he can do to help his son.
 At least that is what I had always thought and that is what I had always done.
 Brandon looked at me as if he wanted to stop me but he lacked the clarity to speak, desperation the only thing evident on his weary face.
 The days since Brandon’s arrest had been some of the toughest days of his life.
 We know that the practice of turning your busted drug users and dealers into snitches was nothing new in the world of illegal drug distribution.
 I had consumed my fair share of drugs and wasn’t just some innocent bystander.
 I had my own issues.
 Maybe this was somehow Karma.
 They certainly don’t have a book that can teach you how to be a good father and my own experiences as a son and a stepson had only given me insight on what not to do as a father.
 Even if this magical book did exist that could help you raise the perfect child, I assume that the chapter titled, “How to Do a Drug Bust for Your Son” would be absent.

The possibility of more rapid economic growth and rising incomes in both developed and developing countries – spurred by further substantial reduction in defence spending, the diffusion and application of new technologies, economic liberalization leading to growth of international trade, the globalization of financial markets, and the emergence of new engines for global expansion among developing countries – indicates that our apprehensions need not prove justified, provided society acts courageously and decisively to meet the challenge.
 A global overview of employment cannot do full justice to the special circumstances, problems and potentials of specific regions and countries, but it can dispel the growing concern that employment has become a problem beyond the means of governments or the global economy to eradicate or even contain.
 In the final analysis, creation of jobs for all is not a question of possibility.
 It is a question of necessity.
 Neither logic nor self-interest justify a detached attitude or a half-hearted effort to address this issue.
 As in the case of the recent global response to the threat of global warming from depletion of the ozone layer, it simply is not acceptable for us to remain indifferent or claim that we are powerless to act where the entire world’s vital self-interests are at stake.
 When war threatens a nation’s borders, technology threatens its environment or unemployment threatens the livelihood of its people and the fabric of its social existence, there is only one acceptable response – that is, action.
 The greatest achievement of this century has not been technological, economic or political, but rather the growing concern and intolerance for the slaughter, persecution or impoverishment of other human beings.
 This marks the awakening of our collective, human consciousness to the full value of human life and the consequent rejection of physical strength, political power and money as the governing values of society.
 This evolution of consciousness has led to monumental changes in the accepted rules of social existence.

The elf stood and dressed, covering his white form in the red and black garb.
 Once dressed, Harruq gave him the ornate elven blade.
 “Your quest is a simple one,” he told his slave.
 “Go to Veldaren.
 Do whatever you must to sneak into the king’s castle.
 Kill if needed.
 When you find King Vaelor, wound him but do not kill him.
 Do not be captured, either.
 Die in combat.”
 Ahrqur nodded, his eyes seething.

 “Excellent.”
 Velixar beamed at his two disciples.
 At his feet lay the wrapped corpse of Ahrqur.
 “Tun’del was a skilled swordmaster.
 You both have proven yourselves as strong as I believed.
 Unwrap the body.
 It is time we begin.”
 Much preparation later, Qurrah and Velixar stood on opposite sides of a naked Ahrqur.
 The elf lay on his back.

He halted his run and fell to one knee.
 His adrenaline was still high, but deep inside he knew he had to find a place to rest.
 The real pain was coming.
 A glance behind did little to raise his spirits.
 He saw at least thirty undead shambling as fast as they could in a widening arc.
 If he remained where he was, he would be seen.
 He struggled to his feet and ran.
 More minutes passed.
 The glow of Woodhaven drifted behind him.
 Breathing was agony.

“Wow,” I mumble, “if you can’t adore that fellow, you’re really a hard case.”
 Laura's Birthday
 First period Monday, I got called to Mrs. Bole’s office.
 I knocked, stepped in, and found her slumped over her desk.
 Though she was big and hearty, today she looked undone, like a visitor to Auschwitz.
 “Sit down, Kenneth.” “What’d I do?” “It’s about Eric.” Studying her mournful eyes, I eased myself into the chair.
 “Yeah?” “They crashed.” My heart stopped and I gave up breathing.
 “Eric?” I gasped.
 "El Cajon Valley Hospital.
 They don’t believe he’ll make it.” My brain catapulted through space, into a black hole.

The opening up of economic relations between the USA and China by President Nixon has made war between the two countries almost unthinkable.
 There are no serious conflicts in the world today that cannot be resolved through consultation, consensus and ‘win-win’ formulas.
 Full Employment
 The fading spectre of nuclear annihilation gave way in the 1990s to the rising spectre of chronic unemployment.
 The end of the Cold War brought with it some wrenching transitions, among them the break-up of the USSR and Comecom, the reunification of Germany, the downsizing of defence manufacturers in America as the result of reduced orders for war materiel, the collapse of Japanese financial markets and onset of a decade-long recession, and displacement of millions of migrant Asian workers following the invasion of Kuwait and the first war in Iraq.
 These events violently disrupted expansion of the world economy and creation of employment opportunities for an expanding labour force in both industrialized and developing countries.
 Near panic levels of concern rippled across the world during this period about rising levels of joblessness, prompting one doomsday author to prophesize the ‘end of work’.
 The situation became particularly acute in developing countries, because of their predominately young populations and high population growth rates.
 Trends and Prospects
 ICPF refused to side with the pessimists who viewed unemployment as a terminal illness spreading rapidly through the entire world economic system.

He found it was holding a purple silk purse containing eight pieces of gold and two of silver.
 Now he had the money he needed to be on the run.
 After forcing himself to wait until the last visible person left the main gate, Rodregas grabbed the trunk and went to the stairs.
 He listened quietly, and hearing nothing, he set the trunk down and quietly walked down the stairs.
 The next floor housed the laboratory.
 The door was locked and he did not want to break it down until he was sure everyone had left.
 The next floor down was the main floor; He stepped out to the main hall and listened.
 He heard nothing but his stomach rumble; he was very hungry and knew that he should eat.
 He was already in the main hall; the room to the right was the kitchen.
 He stepped into the kitchen but then came to a sudden stop.

 One after another the deft strokes came in, and one after another Antonil batted them away using the methodical style that had helped him rise to his place at the top of the Neldaren army.
 His opponent, a young elf whose swordplay was raw compared to most of his brethren, tried to give him no reprieve.
 The guard captain didn’t falter in the slightest.
 “You sacrifice planning and thought for sheer speed and reflexes,” he said, his breathing steady and practiced.

He was used to the sword and shield.
 Rodregas stood with his chain mail over his repaired studded leather armor; a long sword and a shield, both from the dead slavers were in his hands.
 The rules were, of course, not to fight to the death.
 A knight stood in the middle of the square and would declare the winner of the match.
 Rodregas’ first opponent looked like a grizzled army veteran; he had a red ribbon and a blue ribbon so he was a man of some skill.
 Rodregas knew he had to do well today or he had no chance.
 He stepped into the square.
 The sands of the ground shifted slightly under his weight as he circled his opponent.
 The veteran was clearly taking him seriously, going in slowly with his knees bent and his feet keeping active.
 Rodregas would have no skill advantage here.

It was just too painful.
 I was confused, drained to the point of exhaustion.
 I had no way out.
 When they found me, I would have to surrender.
 I could see no other option.
 No one came.
 I wasn’t fool enough to go back voluntarily, but for some reason, they hadn’t followed.
 I didn’t know what to do with myself.
 I had nothing outside of home, outside of the village.
 I didn’t even know where to go, didn’t know where I was.

Grumbling to myself, I promised to try and switch into something better first thing tomorrow morning.
 The class was in a section of the building I hadn't been to yet, one apparently older than the rest of the building.
 The lights were spaced further apart and the cinder blocks in the walls were a slightly different size.
 Good thing I still had my water.
 The old part of the school was just as hot as the rest.
 You'd think functioning air-conditioning would be a necessity for a school so far south.
 At least it should cool down a little in the coming months.
 Assuming of course I lasted that long without losing it from dealing with all of the crazy small-town people in this school.
 I entered the classroom and was immediately greeted by a portly, white-haired woman.
 "Hello, hello.

You know, keeping you from patrolling or something."
 That last bit hadn't really been planned.
 I'd wanted to come downstairs and talk to him, but wouldn't have dreamt of just saying it outright.
 Maybe it was the natural high I got simply from being around him.
 Alec's smile was brief, but it felt like the first one I'd seen since he'd been forced to save me.
 I couldn't blame him for being worried about how this was going to further strain already tense relations with Brandon's pack.
 Still, the transforming expression made me realize just how badly I'd missed his other face, the one that wasn't stern and serious all of the time.
 "No, you're not bothering me in the slightest.
 Jasmin or Isaac either one could easily keep watch.
 Our sense of smell and hearing are good enough that it's all but impossible for even other wolves to catch us unawares.

I in fact happen to know that you're in a band that performs occasionally down in Vegas, so don't go trying to pull a fast one on me."
 Albert looked genuinely startled, but recovered quickly.
 "Hey there, idle, profoundly-untrue comments dropped by Mrs. Campbell in passing conversation don't count.
 I'm absolutely not a member of Fatal Angst."
 "Yes, you are, at least you are until I either decide to dispose of your body, or let your little secret out of the bag because you're not doing your job."
 I hadn't heard Mrs. Campbell approach from behind me, and for a second worried she was really angry, but the way Albert chuckled as he cringed in mock fear alleviated my concerns.
 Albert pushed his glasses a little ways back up his nose, and then wandered off to help the next person with a red card face up on their desk.
 The number of people who proceeded to come into the tutoring lab was nothing less than amazing.
 Based on overheard conversations, it sounded like there was a perfect storm of tests.
 Both of the other math teachers were apparently having tests in every single one of their classes, and Mrs. Campbell was having tests in a couple of hers as well.

Rodregas almost thought he might have some AElf blood.
 It also looked like he might have a broken nose from the previous day’s competition.
 The young man did very well, hitting all five targets.
 His shot on the moving target only nicked the edge, still impressive.
 Rodregas stepped forward and picked up the bow.
 It felt light and a little awkward.
 Rodregas focused on his breathing.
 He had five targets and five arrows.

 The arrow sailed over its right shoulder.

It gave birth to the United Nations, followed by the dissolution of colonial empires and freedom for more than forty subject nations.
 The end of the Cold War marks the end of a seventy-year confrontation between two opposing ideologies – capitalist and socialist – that reflected a more profound conflict between two fundamental aspects of human existence – individual freedom and social responsibility.
 The posing of these two as opposite and mutually exclusive forces has for long limited our freedom of thought and action and prevented us from boldly experimenting with new ways to reconcile them.
 The peaceful termination of this confrontation has lowered the mental barriers.
 It provides us with an opportunity to synthesize these forces in a manner which balances individual freedom with collective action to eradicate the blatant manifestations of poverty, social injustice and inequity.
 Economic liberalism and rising investment in developing countries: One immediate result of this reconciliation has been the recent movement of economic liberalization spreading throughout the developing world, accompanied by the relaxation of bureaucratic constraints that impede growth.
 This trend has stimulated a dramatic increase in foreign investment in these countries, which has risen nearly six-fold during the past seven years.
 Private loans and foreign direct investment together are now approximately twice the level of total overseas development assistance.
 This investment provides additional benefit in the form of increased transfer of technology and management skills, increased access to export markets and a reduction in the cost of capital.
 Defence cuts: The monumental and extravagant waste of human, material, scientific and financial resources resulting from the preparation, execution and consequences of armed conflict are too staggering to quantify.

“Maybe it’s something you should think about.”  He ran his thumb over her lower lip.
 “You deserve better, Marie.”  He tilted her chin up, touching his lips to hers.
 When she didn't pull away, he repeated the feather-light touch.
 He felt her breath, the quivering of her lips.
 He kissed the corner of her mouth and nuzzled her cheek.
 Gathering her closer, he began taking her lips in one soft kiss after another.
 But as her response grew warmer, his kisses became hungrier.
 Marie was growing hot and felt almost drugged by Rick's kisses.
 She ran one hand over his chest, wishing that his shirt had buttons so that she could undo one and slip her hand inside.
 If--oh!

Often government has perceived that its responsibility was to ensure sufficient food to prevent famine, not maximum output and profitability.
 Government machinery has proved effective in forcing through radical measures to disseminate new technology, seed and production methods in the face of crisis, but it usually lacks the driving impetus to work for the highest benefit of individual farmers.
 The shift needed is for planners to study the potentials of the agricultural sector to serve as an engine for job creation and higher incomes, and as a stimulus to industrialization and exports, and then to formulate national goals to maximize exploitation of these potentials.
 Integration of agriculture, marketing and processing
 Conscious efforts can be made to foster the natural linkage between agricultural and industrial development by placing emphasis on crops that have the greatest potential for stimulating the growth of agro-industries, services and exports.
 Filling in the missing links in the chain of processing and distribution, such as pre-cooling for fruit and vegetables, can enable small farmers to produce for national and export markets; it also results in higher at-farm prices and creates alternative forms of rural employment.
 Empowerment of women
 The vast majority of women living in rural areas are engaged in agriculture.
 Therefore, upgrading productivity, skills and incomes in this sector is the single most effective means of improving the livelihood of women in developing countries.
 Skill development programmes in areas such as hybrid seed production, floriculture, inland aquaculture, vegetables and poultry can be particularly beneficial.

I felt my eyes go wide at the idea of something so unbelievable happening to us, and then even wider as I realized this must be what Alec had been referring to.
 'Convince her it's fine for her to leave' indeed.
 He hadn't been kidding about getting us out of the country.
 "Mom, you have to go!
 This is the biggest opportunity ever!"
 She looked doubtful.
 "Sweetie, I know it seems exciting, and heaven knows we could use the money, but that just isn't my kind of thing."
 I shrugged.
 "Yeah, but once you've had some paying photography jobs it's sure to help land others.
 It isn't your ideal kind of work, but it's still a good start, and you never know where it might lead."

At the same time, lifting the tyranny of state terrorism has itself become the occasion in some instances for an outburst of violence by long suppressed groups.
 Eradication of terrorism is possible, but it demands a comprehensive and integrated approach and concerted, collective action.
 The commercialization of the arms trade – which benefits some countries economically at the expense of the security of all nations – must be subject to rigorous monitoring and control by international agencies.
 Vested economic interests that thrive on conflict must be placed under UN surveillance and regulation.
 International institutions must be strengthened to eradicate arms smuggling, narcotics, offshore money laundering and other criminal activities that serve as seedbeds and instruments for terrorism.
 However, no final solution to the problem of terrorism can be arrived at by force alone.
 While terrorism is frequently attributed to religion and ideology, it sprouts and thrives most readily among populations that lack opportunities for gainful employment and economic development.
 Social unrest is an expression of the upward aspiration of those who have been left out of the political and development process or who feel threatened by the rapid pace and stress of social change and inequity.
 Those who lack the opportunity or the ability to labour intensely for their own upliftment express their productive energies through the intensity of violence.
 The international community cannot afford to be silent spectators of the growing violence.

Liz – Since when did you get Psychic powers?
 Jim – Hey do you do readings?
 I’d kinda like to know my future.
 Will I meet my knight in shining armor?
 Johnny – I don’t have psychic powers.
 Jim – Then why did you tell us that you did?
 What a let-down.
 Johnny – I just meant that, I’d rather be hit by a speeding train than to talk to the king of idiots again.
 Liz – Why didn’t you just say that in more simple terms in the first place?
 No need to lead us on.

The first half of Rachel's comment finally sank in, and I nearly tripped.
 "Wait, what dance?"
 "Ashure Day.
 It's an...a local tradition.
 Think of it kind of like earth day, but with a dance.
 Kind of like a pagan Prom.
 Or maybe a pagan homecoming since it's still fall."
 Prom was my arch-nemesis.
 There were really only two times a year that the universe managed to penetrate my historical indifference to the opposite sex.
 Prom, and Valentine's Day.

Information superhighways: Information is a catalyst and stimulant to social development.
 The speed of information, like the speed of transportation, is a critical determinant of economic activity.
 Innovations brought about by the marriage of computers and telecommunications will make possible more, faster and better communication in developing countries at substantially lower cost through global computer networks and satellite-linked telephone systems.
 In some areas, such as finance, news and sports, the barriers to the flow of information are already crumbling.
 The increasing quality, quantity and speed of information flows about markets, technologies and significant events are quickening growth of the global economy.
 One consequence has been the globalization of financial markets, resulting in increased financial transfers to developing countries.
 The technology exists for similar achieve ments in many other fields related to development.
 Global consciousness: The impact of the 1992 Earth Summit goes far beyond the decisions taken to protect the global environment.
 By focusing on critical threats that can only be met through common action, it has changed the way people and nations think about the world and each other.
 A consciousness of One World is emerging above the din of individualistic and nationalistic self-interest.

 If it moves, I can track it.
 And I can’t find a thing.”
 “These two brothers are certainly a mystery,” Aurelia said.
 “When will you meet this other brother?” Dieredon asked.
 “Qurrah?” Aurelia shrugged.
 “When Harruq is ready for us to meet.”
 “Very well.
 I will continue tracking them.

Mrs. North again?"
 I ignored the spate of nasty looks shot my way, gathered my books, accepted the bundle of papers, and hurried off to the stairs.
 It was later than last time, so unless I was quick the bell was going to ring before I made it back down the stairs.
 The congestion was bad in the halls, but for some reason it was twice as bad around stairs.
 Apparently I was hurrying just a little too fast.
 I tripped just before I hit the first step, and almost went crashing down the flight that led to the basement.
 Luckily I was just quick enough to grab the banister and save myself from a broken neck.
 I didn't quite manage to avoid twisting my ankle though, so I limped all the way up to the second floor.
 Trying to be as casual as possible, I looked into the art room as I hobbled by, but they'd rearranged their stations, and someone's easel was in the way now.
 The sprained ankle had slowed me down enough that there was no way I was going to make it back to my locker before the bell rang.

I'd only ever seen him with a serious, if respectful expression.
 Even Rachel's frequent teasing hadn't ever managed to crack his 'working face'.
 "I hardly think that would be the case.
 While you may very well have lost your way, it would have been a small matter for one of the others to track you down.
 You have, if I may say so, a very distinctive smell.
 It reminds me of a type of sage brush that hasn't grown here in quite some time."
 His sigh was more felt than heard, and it put me in mind of mountains, redwoods, and other ancient things.
 "Donovan, can I ask you a question?"
 "Of course, mistress.
 I'm afraid there are many which I won't be able to answer, but it would be a delight to share those things which haven't been forbidden me."

I might have run back to the village right then, but they would never release me.
 I had nothing.
 I glanced down the mountainside.
 I couldn’t have found my way back if I’d wanted to.
 I had no idea where I was.
 I stared at my palms, some spell-bought map carved into my skin, and was hit full force with the knowledge that I didn’t even know where I was going.
 I was about as low on options as I could get.
 If not for Chevelle’s desire to skip out on Council business for a few days, or whatever we were doing here, I’d already be imprisoned.
 I could hope that with the dreams, with the mountains, with wherever my family’s map was taking me, I could remember more, could break some part free.
 It was all I would have in my captivity.

A day since Kojas took him.
 I had told him, when he had first said that Kojas wanted to use him that he didn’t have to worry.
 I should have known that Kojas would do anything to get him, and now Seth was gone.
 After he had been taken and Jason had awakened, the faery jerks had scattered.
 Then a light pixie had showed up, the same one who had saved my life a while ago, and led us all the way to her majesty’s place.
 She was apparently the queen but she was nothing like a stuck up royal leader.
 She was more like a warrior who lead Igneeria in the ‘good times.’ She was really nice but when we had met her, I was in an awful mood.
 No one blamed me; I had just watched one of my best friends get beat up and taken right before my eyes.
 Her Majesty said to return in the morning when I would hopefully be in a better mood.
 So Jason, Emily and I walked to her throne room.

I didn’t read much of it because it didn’t really matter what it said.
 They were the documents that they needed to cover their asses, period!
 Two nervous days passed before I got the go-ahead and a time and location for the drug deal.
 I was instructed to call Ashley and tell her the time but not to commit to the location.
 The police wanted the time to set up the area of the bust location and they did not want the drug dealer to come early and perhaps see them preparing.
 I was instructed to meet the police over an hour before the scheduled time.
 During this entire time since Brandon was busted, my wife and I had been working to detox him.
 We had him on complete lockdown at the house with no visitors allowed.
 His room and the entire house were still searched daily, including the CD cases and every nook and cranny.
 We used the professional drug tests and we tested him randomly.

She'd thought it would take hours and hours to find a handful of books.
 But in only 45 minutes Rick had a long list of books and articles.
 He filled out request forms for the articles and led her into more rows of books than she'd ever seen.
 He pulled out book after book, stacking them in her arms.
 When both had as many as they could carry, they went to check them out.
 "We have 17 books and 21 articles," Rick told her when they were back at his house with their materials spread out on the floor in front of them.
 "I don't even know where to start."
 "Can we wait a while?"
 He looked at her in surprise.
 "You want to wait?

 But if she'd met Rick here, fallen in love with him, and then had to-to go to China or somewhere with him and never seen her family again, would she have done it?
 She hugged her knees, tears flowing down her cheeks.
 She knew without a doubt now that she would have.
 If she could have said good-bye to her family, let them know that she was safe and happy, she would have stayed with Rick.
 She realized now that she hadn't clung to the hope of getting home because she loved and needed and wanted her family and home more than she loved and needed and wanted Rick; she'd clung to that hope because of the feeling that she'd been .

 The arcade manager said he had never seen someone with my level of skill before in all his years of working at that arcade.
 In fact he said that he’d never forget the experience of watching me play.
 I’m just that good.
 Jim – Did he say all of that with a strait face?

 But only because he was happy to bathe in the warm glow of the presence of a true master.
 Jim – Did he say that too?

“Silly girl, we’re already called toad dwarfs.” The one on my leg croaked.
 “Aw darn, never mind then.” So much for being clever.
 The one on my back grabbed my hair.
 He yanked it back.
 “Ow!
 It may be green but I still value it!” I grumbled, trying to pull my head free.
 I also had no desire to be bald at 16.
 “He’s rising, he’s rising!” The dwarf said excitedly.
 His voice cracked at the last word.
 “Who the heck is rising and why does it require pulling my hair out!” I snapped.

When I finally surfaced from orders of operation as the sun started setting, I was pleasantly surprised things had gone so well.
 As masochistic as it sounded, I actually enjoyed settling down with a set of academic problems, and working my way through them.
 Sometimes I entered a Zen-like state where everything else in the world just dropped away.
 It was nice to know the accident hadn't changed that at least.
 My heart stuttered a little, but I wrenched my thoughts away from where they'd been headed, distracting myself by wondering where Mom was.
 She'd been a little flighty before, but now it wasn't uncommon for her to be gone for twenty-four hours at a stretch.
 In some ways it was hard not having her around, but in other ways it was a relief.
 Sometimes she reminded me too much of Dad and Cindi.
 A surge of guilt splashed around inside me at the thought, but it was a realization I'd made weeks ago.
 By now some of the sharper edges to the emotion had worn away.

He stepped back, taking a seat as the wiry man stepped inside the circle then.
 He nodded to me.
 Grey.
 He was thoughtful for a moment, deciding the best way to display his skill, before finally approaching to offer his hand.
 I reached forward, placing my palm against his, and then he was gone.
 His entire body had vanished.
 I half expected to feel his touch—perhaps he’d merely camouflaged himself—but my hand was empty.
 I looked around, baffled.
 The makeshift audience wore easy, amused smiles.
 They watched me, not the vacant space from which Grey had evidently disappeared.

But anywhere else."
 She stirred her tea thoughtfully.
 "And it's accepted?
 In 1927, women can go to speakeasies, but not respectable women."
 "We don't have speakeasies like those in the '20s, but if you want to, I'll take you dancing one night.
 To one of the wild places where the kids go if you like--and you'll still be considered respectable."
 They spent the next hour comparing their respective decades.
 She told him all about her favorite stars and pictures.
 She'd known one of the eight contestants in the first Miss America contest in 1921, and she'd followed the Scopes trial in 1925 with shocked fascination.
 He told her that all 50 states--"Fifty!"

Most importantly, there is hope where there is love and there is love where there is family.
 Within any family and throughout the generations there will be many moments that define you as a person.
 If you are a father or a mother now, there was a day when you were a son or a daughter.
 Perhaps one day you will become a grandparent.
 During all of these periods your experiences and certain moments mold you into who you will be.
 It isn’t easy to forget the dark places in your past but you can either learn from them and become a better person or repeat the same behavior and have it slowly destroy you.
 I make many mistakes as a father, but I have always tried the best I know how.
 Sometimes no matter what a person does as a parent, children may travel to dangerous places.
 Some will return from those places unharmed and some may never return.
 A family can look perfect from the outside but be quite the opposite on the inside.

The opening on top actually fit over his huge head.
 Doi’van guessed that it had been the chain of the large overweight slaver that he had killed.
 While the equipment was all of average quality, Rodregas was smiling because clearly there were three sets of everything plus a pack horse for equipment.
 Imeralda was clearly planning on joining them.
 While that is what his heart hoped for he was not sure if it was the smartest move.
 When they were working on the tack for the horses, he went ahead and asked.
 “Imeralda, I want to make sure you want to continue with us.
 I mean I love to travel with you, but while Doi’van and I are warriors, when you joined us it was only as a travel companion.
 If you want to stay with the village or stay with Jordaan I will understand.
 You know that by now they will be hunting us, if not because of Ravenhurr’s death, than because of the missing Immortal Guards.” “You know that I probably killed more slavers with the Black Yew bow than either you or Doi’van right?” asked Imeralda with a snort.

"Terribly."
 Her heart flipped over as he kissed her hand.
 He drove her to Boston’s finest dress shop, sitting down to smoke and read the newspaper as she tried on clothes.
 "What do you think?"
 she asked, turning slowly in front of him.
 "Very nice."
 "But do you really like it?
 I don't have anything this color, but I like it."
 It was called blue lotus and was the predominant color in an Egyptian motif.
 She and her mother had attended a fashion show two weeks ago, and she'd loved the Egyptian patterns on the mannequins who'd modeled them.

What caused the return that small piece of delusional fantasy?
 It was funny the first time, but it’s lost some of its charm in each re-telling.
 Jim – It’s not fantasy damn it.
 The Canadians are coming.
 Eugene – Sure they are.
 Johnny – Right after the Martians.
 Jim – I hope you like watching hockey, because in a few short years it’s all that will be on television.
 Mark my words.
 Eugene – Your words are marked.
 But what do we do when you’re wrong?

But I'd rather talk."
 "All right."
 Arm in arm they returned to the living room and sat on the sofa.
 "Can you tell me anything about what happened, darling?
 If you were hurt or starved?"
 Marie sighed, wishing she could tell her mother everything.
 But she'd think that Marie had been so traumatized that she'd lost her grip on reality.
 "I wasn't hurt or starved.
 In fact, I was treated very well."
 She pressed her lips together.

At least if Brandon's pack does come after us there, we're within our rights to do something about it."
 I opened my mouth to comment on the fact that Brandon's pack was roughly twice the size of ours, only to realize that scurrying back home kind of precluded continuing to help out at the tutor lab.
 "What about helping Mrs.
 Campbell?"
 It shouldn't have surprised me that Alec thought it over for several seconds before shaking his head.
 Whatever else he was, he wasn't the thoughtless jerk Brandon had proven himself to be.
 "I'm sorry, Adriana.
 I wish we could, for Rachel's sake as well as yours, but it's just too risky.
 Fewer witnesses means more chance Brandon's people will try to arrange for something to happen.
 There are just too many of them for us to meet them in a stand-up fight and come out unscathed."

“So, how old are you?” “Twenty-two,” he said, almost shamefacedly.
 At first, I was shocked at the number; I thought maybe I’d misunderstood.
 But I remembered reading the human lifespan was very brief.
 I’d have guessed ten times that number if he were an elf.
 “Why the hint of embarrassment?” “They tell me I should have a family by now.” “You have none?” “A mother and father but none of my own.
 No wife, no children.” “You are expected to have a wife and child after just two decades of life?” He laughed for some reason I could not see.
 “Then you have no family of your own?” “I am not expected to pair for quite some time, if ever.
 And children?
 Ha!” He was visibly perplexed so I kept talking.
 “I have a family as well, though my mother died recently.” Sadness washed his features.

“What do you mean, you haven’t found him yet?” “I crashed into Jazell, who was doing, like, forty,” Jason pointed to me.
 “Then we both found you fighting beasts with your fiery fingertips of death.” She raised an eyebrow.
 “Fiery fingertips of death?” “Hey,” he shrugged, “Jazell’s sarcasm is contagious.” “Anyway, we better find Seth before he gets into some serious trouble,” I said, and walked off.
 I went farther down the hill and the fighting spread out more.
 I tripped on a dead root and cursed as I stood back up.
 The slope started to even out more and the trees popped up again.
 Be careful.
 I stopped.
 The voice had come out of nowhere.
 The time is near.

 Cleo – And when do you ever plan to have children hmmm?

Rodregas had an idea about how he wanted to start this new day.
 “Doi’van, Imeralda,” he said getting their attention.
 “I have not told you much about my past.
 But, as a teenager I served as a squire of the knightly Order of the Soaring Heavens”.
 At their nod he added,”I was never raised to knighthood, as I had neither the noble lineage nor the martial prowess.
 My life as a squire was a good life, one I appreciated more afterwards than when I was living it.
 Both the knights and the squires always started off the day with a prayer to the Celestial Gods.
 I have not done this in over forty years, but I am going to start again and I would like you to join me if you would.” The two looked at Rodregas, they were very different people, but they both seemed unsure what to say to his request.
 Finally, Doi’van nodded at Imeralda and said to Rodregas, “It has been too long since I have prayed as well, it would be good for the soul.
 Please lead us in prayer.” Imeralda did not say anything, but she nodded and followed the two of them outside.

The mist swirled and a cold chill that ran shivers down my spine ascended on us.
 And out of the mist stepped a dark figure.
 Kojas.
 Again.
 This time for real.
 Not in a dream/vision.
 My heart stopped and my blood froze.
 Kojas’ red eyes gleamed in the darkness and his cloak snapped at the wind.
 He looked up and his red eyes stared at me.

He hoped she'd forgive him soon.
 He'd hate to waste a whole Sunday fighting.
 He took his tea out to the garden.
 Gazing at the white roses, he sighed, wishing Marie would come down and share the beauty of the morning with him.
 He couldn't blame her for being mad, but he was getting desperate.
 He felt as if he were in a race to convince her to marry him before they reached a point where they were unable to stop themselves from making love.
 He couldn't keep pushing her away forever.
 It was a wonder he'd been able to stop himself--and her--this long.
 Being here was like being on vacation, she'd told him.
 He sipped his tea, trying to imagine what this was all really like for her.

“Weird.” “Yes, that’s normal.” “Hot,” I said, unclasping my cloak and tossing it off behind me.
 I swayed.
 “Maybe you should sit down,” he warned.
 That sounded like a good idea.
 “Half-breed?” I asked, unable to form full sentences.
 “Half fairy, half elf.” He sat in a chair as he started to answer and I kept moving past the bench where I intended to land and crawled onto his lap, curling my feet up, knees to my chest.
 His voice seemed mesmerizing as he continued, “Her mother was a fairy from the West.
 Fiery one, her.” I wrapped my arms around my legs, holding my knees tight, and placed my chin there to rest my head.
 “Tell me more.” It was all I could do to pay attention to his words, but I was fascinated by their sound.

Rodregas did not think he actually minded coming over to his room.
 Rodregas smiled and thought that given the way Doi’van talked about pain when training them with the staff, that he must be immune to mere pain anyhow.
 Imeralda repeated Jordaan’s question.
 “Jordaan asked Rodregas if you two were related as being Hellborn is very rare in the Eastern Realms.” And Doi’van’s surprised expression Imeralda added, “While I cannot sense the feel and make up of a body like I can a tree, I do know the feel of magic, and I had thought a few times that I sensed the feel of Brimstone and Fire not just with Doi’van, but with both of you.” Rodregas could feel his eyes widen as Imeralda confirmed what Jordaan had felt.
 He had been thinking while Doi’van was being fetched and he had a question for his friend.
 “Doi’van, you were swept up quickly after you entered the Eastern Realms; you clearly have a strong physical essence and strong magical power.
 The Immortalists should not be interested in either.
 Which did they show interest in?” Rodregas asked.
 “Both really, I did not understand why they wanted me.
 I thought if you were Hellborn you were safe from the Immortalists,” Doi’van replied, “They would cut me to see how fast I would heal and do tests where they were clearly testing my physical side.

She'd been so caught up in their kisses and caresses that she probably wouldn't have stopped him no matter how he'd touched her.
 He could have made love to her.
 Yet he'd stopped.
 But he couldn't regret that decision.
 She'd probably let him make love to her, but she'd be devastated when it was over.
 Her morals were deeply ingrained, and the guilt would eat away at her.
 He loved her far too much to put her through that.
 But they couldn't go on like this.
 He'd always prided himself on his self-control, but living under the same roof with a woman he loved, a woman who begged for his kisses--that was too much.
 But he knew Marie didn't really understand.

A comprehensive study of successful systems and institutions that can be transferred and adapted to local conditions will document the enormous untapped potential for stimulating faster economic and job growth by inventing, imitating and further improving social systems.
 Action Plan to Stimulate Employment in Developing Countries
 Employment generation is a product of multiple factors that combine together.
 Stimulating job creation requires a comprehensive approach, rather than partial policies or piecemeal strategies.
 The achievements of the Newly Industrializing Economies (NIEs) of East Asia demonstrate that tremendous increases in employment generation can be achieved based on comprehensive strategies.
 While broad prescriptions should not be indiscriminately applied to the widely disparate situations confronting different countries, the availability of a number of tested methods under lines the fact that effective and proven policy measures can be formulated to meet the employment needs of every developing country.
 A number of the strategies briefly listed below are enlarged upon in sub sequent chapters of the report, but listed here for the purpose of comprehensiveness
 1.Emphasize agriculture: Utilize agriculture as a source of economic growth and job creation by a shift to high value-added, commercial crops, supported by policy measures to upgrade technology, improve skills, raise productivity, ensure the supply of essential inputs, establish marketing and distribution chan nels, create linkages between agriculture and industry, and cater to export markets.
 2.Promote small enterprises: Promote small enterprises by policies to make technology, training, credit, marketing and distribution channels more easily accessible to small business, and by forging linkages between universities, research institutes and small enter prises.
 The creation of micro-enterprise banks and credit unions specifically designed to cater to the needs of the self-employed and small firms can be especially effective.

It’s fun.” The way she pronounced my name, like it was dear to her, made it harder to be angry with her.
 But I made the effort.
 “It’s not entirely my fault,” I huffed.
 And then I was sorry I’d said anything.
 I didn’t need to defend myself to her.
 “I know,” she said, “but it’s still fun.” I wondered if she did know.
 Like everyone before.
 I pushed the thought from my head.
 “I thought the dogs were their weapons of choice,” I said, cringing a bit as I remembered their demonstration.

Drawing her close, he bent his head and kissed her.
 Marie sighed with pleasure as she returned Rick’s kiss.
 She’d never dreamed anything could make her feel this way.
 “Are you hungry?” he asked, kissing the tip of her nose.
 “Starved.”  She hugged him.
 They went downstairs with their arms around each other.
 “Did you make pancakes?” she asked.
 “Yeah.
 I’m starved, and I figured you would be too.
 So we’re having pancakes and bacon and eggs and juice.” “Mmm—that sounds great.

A pair of muscular arms encircled my tingling waist and legs, holding me tightly to a near rock-hard chest as Alec deftly weaved through the approaching crowd of students.
 I closed my eyes as a wave of heat started at my collarbones and rushed up to the tips of my ears.
 I wanted to throw up, except that would be even more embarrassing than being carried out of class by the most popular boy in school.
 I opened my eyes and found we were already out in the hall.
 Alec's stride was so smooth it was hard to believe we weren't still back in the classroom.
 "Put me down, I mean please put me down."
 Those clear, deep eyes met mine for a second, seeming to look past the surface and all the way down to the bleeding mental gash that'd just triggered my most recent collapse.
 I was trying to marshal my arguments, but his eyes wiped my mind clean.
 I couldn't form another coherent thought until he shook his head and looked away.
 "You need to see the nurse."

It was a species I didn't recognize, but it still called to me.
 For a second I could almost hear a familiar voice whispering in my ear.
 "Come on, Adri.
 Cindi's already climbed up to the second set of branches.
 You can do it, but you don't have to do it all by yourself, let me help you."
 My vision was growing blurry.
 I tried to wrench my thoughts back to safe territory, but it was too late, Dad's face was already filling up my vision.
 Cindi and I looked nothing like Mom.
 She was all dark, wavy hair, olive skin and at five-three hadn't been able to kiss Dad unless he bent down.
 Dad was the one who gave us the blond hair and a shot at maybe hitting an average height.

I thought… how could you not know?” Humiliation flooded through me.
 He was right, and not only had I wished her to choke, I had been too much a fool to see I had caused it, just as I had caused the speaker to choke.
 I squeezed my eyes closed tight in misery, rolling away from him to curl onto a rock.
 He let me, stepping away to unsaddle the horses and settle onto a seat of his own.
 We were both still until nightfall, when he retrieved a blanket from the pack and laid it over me.
 I didn’t thank him, fearing what would come out if I spoke.
 The next morning was quiet as Chevelle saddled our horses.
 I had plenty to think of besides the questions that had seemed so important the previous day.

 I had thought it was a mistake.

Harruq whirled on him, a quick double strike knocking the sword from his hand.
 Helpless, the man staggered backward, clutching his wounded side.
 His eyes pleaded, but his mouth would dare not say the demeaning words.
 Harruq cut him again and again.
 His arms, his chest, his face: it all bled.
 But he remained alive, at least until that final moment when the two magic blades scissor-cut his neck.
 Harruq sheathed his swords and held the decapitated head of his foe high above him.
 Full of pride, Qurrah watched his brother roar his victory to the night sky.

Mr. Paterson was still too new to know what he was dealing with.
 For a moment it looked like Brandon was going to let Vincent knock the teacher into a wall, but then he gestured Vincent back.
 Brandon's pack relaxed slightly, and then, presumably acting on a signal from Alec that I couldn't see, Dominic and Jasmin fell back to help Jess and I.
 Even with Dominic under my right arm, I couldn't hop along without jostling my ankle, and I felt tears gathering in the corners of my eyes again.
 Alec carefully lifted me into his arms before I took more than two or three hops.
 Jasmin had her cell phone out before she'd even made it to the stairs, and the sound of a massive engine under hard acceleration heralded the arrival of our limo.
 I leaned back in my seat as everyone else settled into their spots.
 Alec pulled out his pocket square and used it to dab away my tears.
 "I'm sorry.
 I didn't mean to set you down so hard."

And a cocker spaniel bitch named Cyrano.
 Born with eyes the color of the sea, green and mud, a dull roiling behind a semitranslucent screen.
 Born in a matter of minutes, so fast the nurses were dubious, the doctor almost late.
 The town was Lewiston, New York, a carbuncle on the gritty side of gritty Niagara Falls, New York, the former honeymoon capital of the United States, a country which, like Niagara Falls in microcosm, had lately fallen into disrepair.
 Now, Niagara Falls, Ontario, just over the national border, where my mother's incredibly large family hailed from, was bright and brisk and clean and gardeny, the shiny flipside of its American counterpart.
 I’ve seen the great falls frozen; I’ve seen it turned off as if there were a giant tap.
 I’ve stood on a rocking boat deck beneath its monstrous incontestableness.
 Where I was born is a grey little town, a pustule on the side of grey little Niagara New York.
 The Canadian side had the greener grass, we all knew, even as late at night, in our trundle beds, we felt the thrum in our veins of a power larger than kings, a warbling of just what the earth has in mind, though it stayed, of course, just beyond us.
 I longed to be from the Canadian side; I longed to be Canadian.

Could this get any worse?
 Yes, it could.
 It came back to me then.
 I dropped into a chair, my head falling into my hands to cover my face.
 Ruby started to say something, but Chevelle cut her off.
 “Won’t you offer your guest breakfast?” She sniffed.
 “Lunch maybe.” A plate of food landed on the table in front of me with a slap.
 “Thank you,” I managed.
 I was hungry, despite the embarrassment.
 I grabbed the plate and started eating.

They returned to their rooms that night tired; they had tracked down twelve more squires.
 All had at least two ribbons; and all swore secrecy at the source of their sigil.
 The biggest surprise was probably Geriodon, who had beaten Rodregas earlier that day.
 Rodregas could not argue against sharing the minor sigil as he clearly fit the description of a worthy candidate.
 Geriodon was more than happy to swear that he had no love for the Guild and that Justice should be dealt to all equally.
 But before accepting the sigil he wanted to be sure that any Shadow Order he joined was mostly about secrecy to protect themselves, and that he would still be able to compete for true knighthood in the Order of the Soaring Heavens.
 Rodregas dropped into his cot tired and exhausted.
 Even with his healing sigil he had needed a full night’s rest, but duty did not wait for what a man needed.
 Imeralda woke him slightly after dawn, and Rodregas could tell that both she and Doi’van had spent the few hours left of the night working on what was left of their equipment.
 The tear in both his leather shirt and chain were sewn up, the first with thread the second with steel wire.

I was absently sketching what I expected the inside of the opera house to look like, when a tap on my shoulder pulled me out of my reverie.
 "I'm so sorry, Mrs. Campbell.
 I finished early, but I should have started on one of the catch-up assignments.
 I just didn't want to get into a whole new subject with only ten minutes left."
 Her smile was much more understanding than normal for a classroom situation.
 It took the sting out of the words that were probably just for the people close enough to overhear.
 "Don't you worry, Miss Paige, I'll let you know when I don't think you're keeping up.
 Seeing as you are done though, would you please run something over to Mrs. North?
 I'd do it, but I need to go to a special projects meeting today during lunch."
 As quickly as that, my books were in my backpack and I was on my way to the second story of the school, which housed music, sketching, and all the other forms of art lesser mortals like me would never master.

A comprehensive study of successful systems and institutions that can be transferred and adapted to local conditions will document the enormous untapped potential for stimulating faster economic and job growth by inventing, imitating and further improving social systems.
 Action Plan to Stimulate Employment in Developing Countries
 Employment generation is a product of multiple factors that combine together.
 Stimulating job creation requires a comprehensive approach, rather than partial policies or piecemeal strategies.
 The achievements of the Newly Industrializing Economies (NIEs) of East Asia demonstrate that tremendous increases in employment generation can be achieved based on comprehensive strategies.
 While broad prescriptions should not be indiscriminately applied to the widely disparate situations confronting different countries, the availability of a number of tested methods under lines the fact that effective and proven policy measures can be formulated to meet the employment needs of every developing country.
 A number of the strategies briefly listed below are enlarged upon in sub sequent chapters of the report, but listed here for the purpose of comprehensiveness
 1.Emphasize agriculture: Utilize agriculture as a source of economic growth and job creation by a shift to high value-added, commercial crops, supported by policy measures to upgrade technology, improve skills, raise productivity, ensure the supply of essential inputs, establish marketing and distribution chan nels, create linkages between agriculture and industry, and cater to export markets.
 2.Promote small enterprises: Promote small enterprises by policies to make technology, training, credit, marketing and distribution channels more easily accessible to small business, and by forging linkages between universities, research institutes and small enter prises.
 The creation of micro-enterprise banks and credit unions specifically designed to cater to the needs of the self-employed and small firms can be especially effective.

His chuckle pulled my smile wider.
 "No.
 If you're really worried about it just make sure that one of the others are in the room at the same time with you."
 "Now that has some real possibilities."
 I was still rolling the thought around in my mind when the bell rang and Alec pulled me to my feet.
 We swapped out our books and were halfway to Spanish when Vincent and Brandon strode into view.
 Moving so smoothly I was positive that nobody else even realized anything was wrong, Alec swung me around so he was between them and me.
 The tension ratcheted up in step with the rolling waves of energy, as Brandon and Vincent drew nearer.
 They split up when they saw us, casually positioning themselves so Alec couldn't protect me from both of them.
 I felt my knees stop working as I took in Brandon's lazy, confident smile, and Vincent's sick, eager expression, but the gentle pressure of Alec's grasp on my hand kept me from falling down.

Rick pulled her onto his lap and began devouring her mouth.
 If he didn't know better, he'd swear she was the most cunning seductress he'd ever known.
 Her innocence combined with her confession was a powerful aphrodisiac.
 She was so trusting and yet so passionate, her mouth as hungry as his, her hands caressing and clutching and clawing at his chest and shoulders and neck.
 Hadn't she understood a word he'd said?
 Rick let the embrace go on for as long as he could.
 Then he ended it abruptly, setting her on the sofa and holding himself away from her.
 "Rick," she gasped, reaching for him.
 "No.
 No, no, no," he groaned, refusing to let her put her arms around him or kiss him.

Just let me catch my breath and I'll be as right as ever."
 Several minutes later, once the renewed bout of coughing had subsided, Mallory looked back up at me with wan features.
 "How did it happen?
 What brought things between Brandon and our Alec to a head?"
 "It was my fault.
 I'd been dating Brandon, and we went to a party.
 Only while we were there he tried to do things I wasn't comfortable with.
 When I told him no, he--they--threw me out and told me to find my own way home."
 It was harder to relate the story than I'd expected, but Mallory's cluck of disapproval over Brandon's actions helped a little.
 It made me hope that maybe she wasn't going to hate me for bringing ruin to Alec and the others.

I'd do it, but I need to go to a special projects meeting today during lunch."
 As quickly as that, my books were in my backpack and I was on my way to the second story of the school, which housed music, sketching, and all the other forms of art lesser mortals like me would never master.
 The journey would've been completely unremarkable except that I happened to glance into one of the classrooms just before I found Mrs. North's room.
 Even a brief glance screamed art students.
 There were at least twenty people sitting in front of contraptions that looked like a cross between an easel and a desk, and most of them had the look of intense concentration I'd come to associate with Mom attempting to frame a picture.
 The notable exception was Alec, who I almost didn't recognize.
 I hadn't expected to see him in an art class, but more than that was the way his face seemed transformed.
 He'd always been gorgeous.
 I could dislike, even hate him, and still acknowledge that he made my heart go pitter-patter, but this was something else.
 He looked so happy, so at peace with the world, that for the brief moment between when I saw him and when I recognized him, I thought I'd seen an angel.

Kojas pulled his swords back and slashed through the air.
 Seth ducked and stabbed at his opponents’ middle.
 Kojas brought his sword down and swiped Seth’s.
 It twisted out of Seth’s grip and fell to the ground.
 I wanted to scream, but I couldn’t.
 I was frozen in fear.
 Seth dashed to his sword, hand out stretched.
 Then Kojas raised a hand and something dark shot out of it.
 It slammed into Seth’s side and he fell to the ground.
 NO!

One consequence has been to increase the attractiveness of drugs cultivation as an alternative source of income for farmers in developing countries.
 At the height of the drug wars, the then President of Colombia, Virgilio Barco, argued that farmers in his country would readily give up cocaine production if the international price of coffee could be stabilized at its former price level.
 His call unheeded, the United States has been forced to spend billions of dollars fighting drugs crimes and expanding prisons due to the rapid increase of drugs consumption in America.
 By a strange circuitous mechanism, the savings to consumers in developed nations by the refusal of their governments to negotiate international commodity agreements favour able to developing countries has cost these governments and their economies tens of billions of dollars in the form of loan write-offs and crime fighting.
 If an international commission in the 1970s had tried to point out this linkage between low agricultural incomes in Colombia and drug-related crime in New York, London or Moscow, it would have been readily dismissed.
 But this is the type of understanding and perspective needed by governments and international agencies today to formulate effective policy measures in an interdependent world.
 Cooperative Security
 Eliminating nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles and small arms proliferation are practical measures whose time has come.
 But by themselves these steps will only mitigate the most pernicious threats to international security.
 They will not provide an effective system for ensuring the peace and security of all nations that is so vitally needed, and now so imminently possible, as a basis for accelerating the political, economic and social development of humankind.

There are a total of five different events.” Rodregas nodded.
 He had not remembered the point system but he knew well that a knight is unique for his mastering of five different fighting styles.
 Doi’van continued, “The first they call ‘open fist’ which does not really make any sense to me, but it is barehanded with no armor.
 I think you are likely to do very well with that one.
 In fact, I think you would be wise to finish one of the top winners.
 The next is the bow…,” Doi’van glancing at Imeralda.
 Rodregas could not help but smile, “I know you guys think of my skill with the bow in terms of my inability to use the Black Yew bows.
 But really, I can shoot a bow with skill.” Doi’van and Imeralda looked at him doubtfully.
 “The challenge,” said Doi’van, “is not to be simply good but to be able to outshoot over one hundred other highly skilled warriors, and the targets are multiple and difficult including a moving target.
 Unfortunately, all the targets are within normal range for a human, your strength will not help.

 The next morning Harruq did not put on his armor or prepare his blades.
 “I have to see Aurelia,” he told his brother, who nodded in understanding.
 “I will wait for you,” Qurrah said.
 “Return before the battle starts.”
 “I will,” Harruq said.
 Then he was gone, rushing down the streets of Woodhaven toward the calm forest that nestled about it.

She wouldn't get to go to Hollywood.
 Dropping into a chair, she drew her legs up and wrapped her arms around her knees.
 She wanted to go to Hollywood more than she'd ever wanted anything.
 Well, not more than she wanted to go home.
 She was having fun here, but it was as if she were on holiday.
 She missed her mother and father and friends, and she didn't think she could bear it if she thought she'd never get back.
 What if she skipped her walk in the garden today and today turned out to be her chance to get back?
 But she knew that no one in 1927 was going to take her to Hollywood.
 She smiled, remembering with pleasure the moment when Rick had said he was taking her to Hollywood.
 Her heart sped up again at just the memory.

Art – That’s the problem, it’s handing from the wall in my living room.
 She gave it to me as a birthday present a couple years ago.
 It was all done in spray paints.
 It looks fantastic, in my opinion.
 Tell you what, why don’t we just start here, with this painting.
 Karen – It’s breathtaking.
 What’s it of?
 Art – I don’t know, I never got a chance to ask her about it.
 If I had to guess, I’d say it was a landscape of the planet Mars at sunrise.

“My name is Dieredon,” the elf gasped.
 “Know it before I send you to the abyss.”
 He fired two arrows, one for each eye.
 They shattered into fire, and finally blood did flow.
 It ran down the dead flesh and bone that was his face, over his black robes, and pooled in the grass below.
 He fell prone, still screaming his anger and fury.
 For five hundred years he had walked the land of Dezrel.
 All that time, all those killings, and this was how he would fail.
 “Karak!” he shouted, all his power fleeing him.
 His undead minions collapsed, their souls released.

I reach for my waist and pull the wire off before he can help me.
 I hold it out to him, he takes it from me and turns it off, and he says, “We got them.” I am so relieved but that is only one answer to one question and I have many.
 The deal was done and I was so relieved that it was over.
 I then called my wife who was so wound up from the lack of communication over such a long period of time.
 She sobbed uncontrollably as I told her I was unharmed, headed home, the ordeal was over and we busted the drug dealers.
 A hero’s welcome awaited me, as my son was so thankful for what I had done for him.
 As I went to bed that night, my mind would not shut off and the events of that evening replayed in my head over and over again.
 I lay awake for hours wondering what would have happened if the dealer hadn’t run into the cops.
 They both confessed to the drug deal when separately interrogated.
 The officer said they had less than half of the money, which she had attempted to hide in a trash can in the Starbucks’ bathroom, and Steve had a gun, which Ashley admitted they would have used if I didn’t give them the drugs once I discovered they were short on cash.

She glanced at the changed thistle and then, briefly, me, but when I tried to meet her gaze, it shifted to the wall of books.
 “Well, good for you, Frey.
 Your efforts are finally paying off.” I stared blankly at her.
 “What do you say we wrap it up for today?
 I’ve got some business with Council.” I stumbled off the stool, half numb from being still so long, and made my way outside into the warm sun, unsure of my direction.
 The idea of lingering within sight of the village center didn’t have much appeal, but I was in no hurry to get back home to Fannie.
 Choosing instead a rambling, rarely used path out of the village, I found myself wandering idly through the trees and, eventually, into an abandoned, overgrown garden, where I tried to work out what to do with my now empty afternoon.
 Sitting surrounded by the various weeds, my tutor might have urged me to do something useful, like identify the species, but she wasn’t here, and I couldn’t help but attempt to repeat the process I’d used on the thistle in her study.
 I’d been warned not to practice without supervision, but the field felt alone as I concentrated on one weed and then on each of the others, spinning my charms in an attempt to develop them.
 I had no luck with the wild flowers and renegade vegetable plants, but a small thorn tree and a couple of noxious strains began to mature in response to the magic.

I finally pulled out my Biology book.
 A coldly rational part of me knew that however this ended up playing out, I'd still have a test on Monday, and I'd still want to pass.
 It'd be nice sometimes to make the kind of dramatic gesture that you see on movies, or read about in books.
 Instead, I was sitting here with a stupid textbook while everything else inside of me hurt in a funny, cold kind of way.
 Like it hurt so much I could only feel the edges of the pain.
 Spanish followed Biology; then other subjects came and went until I felt like I'd made enough progress, or possibly wasted enough time.
 I collapsed into bed hours early and slept poorly.
 Sunday was about the same, only my insides felt even rawer under the calm surface.
 Like maybe they'd had something caustic poured on them.
 I woodenly went through the motions of studying, and then finally pushed all of my books to the side and opened up Les Misérables.

I'd been desperate to win a ticket, and he had to take yet another opportunity to rub in the fact that he'd already seen it.
 That he was rich enough to see it anywhere in the world as often as he wanted to.
 Even my desire to tell Alec off wasn't strong enough to overcome the pure joy at having won.
 The next two hours floated by, and before I would've believed it possible, I found myself heading towards the tutoring lab.
 Rachel met me outside the door, her face lit up with a smile even more striking than her usual expression.
 "You won.
 I'm so excited that you won.
 Guess what.
 I traded tickets with Suzanne Bergerman, so we get to sit together!"

It gathered in my hair, leaving it a matted mess with the single braid—Ruby’s handiwork—dripping condensation over the shoulder of my cloak.
 I decided to practice as we rode, closing my eyes to sink partially into my horse, still alert to my own self and the outside world.
 It was there, leading my horse and seeing through his eyes, that the pain struck.
 It came on instantaneously, hitting me like a blade, cutting, shearing.
 It was accompanied by sharpness of sound as well.
 My ears were in excruciating pain.
 The horse dropped, his head smacked to the ground and I watched through his eyes as he hit.
 The animal’s senses stilled, not panicked as my own.
 I didn’t understand what was happening, couldn’t quite form a thought.
 I yearned to retreat into the horse, run from the agony, but the severity of it tore me back and kept me there in my own head.

"Break it up!
 You kids back off!"
 The words seemed to float in from far away.
 They certainly didn't have an effect on any of the shape shifters.
 Vincent was moving too slowly for my human eyes to detect any change, but I was sure he was closer now than the last time I'd looked.
 The feeling of insects marching across my skin intensified as James started shaking.
 Jasmin and Dominic both followed suit within seconds, and the feeling doubled as several of Brandon's wolves went into near convulsions.
 "I said break it up!"
 Mr. Paterson shoved his way past a pair of Brandon's wolves, and for a split second I thought they were going to turn and kill him.
 A heartbeat before they moved a low, barely perceptible growl washed over the entire scene.

Ha!” He was visibly perplexed so I kept talking.
 “I have a family as well, though my mother died recently.” Sadness washed his features.
 “I’m sorry.
 Was it an imp?” “No.” I laughed at the strange idea.
 And for no apparent reason, I told him the truth.
 “She died of sorrow.” His brow furrowed.
 We shared the boar and talked further, casually, as if we were old friends.
 He resituated himself on the rock, coming closer to me, and his shirt moved to expose a different color skin where it opened at the chest.
 I reached out to pull it aside and his eyes grew wild at the touch.
 “Your flesh is a different tone here.” He smiled, as if I were being coy.

Let us begin.”
 Velixar taught until the stars retreated from the obnoxious sun.
 Qurrah returned home, his eyes sagging and his mind exhausted.
 When he climbed into bed, he fell asleep instantly.
 Not long after, Harruq rose, took his swords, and left for his own meeting.

 [section break](break.png)
 “You’re late,” Aurelia said, stepping out from behind a tree.
 Harruq shrugged and held out two branches he had whittled into crude imitations of swords.
 “Had to make something for me to spar you with,” he said.

The flame surrounding the skulls flared even brighter, but beneath their tails trailed long threads of silver.
 When Qurrah looked up, he saw hundreds of the threads twisting and curling together, coiling toward a hidden presence deep within the orc army.
 Taking in a deep breath, Qurrah pooled his strength and focused on the skull taunting his brother, visualizing the thread and seeking to sever it.
 There was a pull on his chest—the taste of copper on his tongue.
 When he opened his eyes, the skull fell to the battlements.
 The jaw snapped and rotting teeth clattered to the streets below.
 “You did it!” Harruq picked up the skull, frowning at its ordinariness.
 Shrugging, he flung it toward the distant army of orcs.
 “Not done yet,” Qurrah said, sweat lining his face, his breathing soft and ragged.
 “There’re so many.

The attack came as a complete surprise.
 One moment I was quietly studying, an instant later hordes of shape shifters were pouring into the mansion.
 Most of them looked just like Simon and Nathanial, pony-sized wolves moving with blinding speed as they tore through doors and raced down halls.
 Brandon came in immediately behind the first batch of wolves.
 There was no way I could've known that the gray monster who casually sliced through walls and two-by-fours with his wickedly curved claws was Brandon, but I was somehow certain.
 He was built just like Alec had been Friday night, only so much bigger that he had to crouch forward to avoid hitting his head on the unusually high ceilings.
 Donovan faced off against one of the first wolves, but it was obvious he was no match for the grace and power of his opponent.
 The gentle, aging butler was knocked to the ground between one heartbeat and the next.
 I was mercifully spared from seeing the wreckage left when Brandon's wolves moved on, but there was no doubt in my mind that Donovan was dead.
 Screams, distant enough that they had to be coming from the other wing of the house, reached out and pierced my heart.

Harruq watched an orc wielding two swords cut off the arm of one soldier, and, as the blood from the limb splattered across his face, he turned and decapitated another with two vicious hacks.
 The orc roared in victory only to die as a soldier shoved his sword in his side and out his back.
 “Will they make it through?” Harruq asked, in awe of the display.
 Qurrah glanced over the wall and then back to the main combat.
 Archers continued eviscerating the orc forces.
 If they could push into the city, their arrows would be a nuisance at best, but it seemed they had underestimated the human soldiers.
 “They are running out of time,” Qurrah said.
 “But they might.”
 He glanced back to the necromancer, and then he saw his eyes, just hints of red underneath the hood of his robes.
 Qurrah shivered as whispers shot up his spine.

Qurrah nodded but said nothing.
 Instead, he turned and joined his brother.
 “Let’s go home,” he said.
 “I’m thinking that’s a great idea,” Harruq said.
 The two stepped around the bodies of the slain as they headed east, leaving Velixar alone in the emptiness of Cornrows.
 “Incredible,” Velixar said when they were gone.
 “Never would I have guessed they had such power.” He paused, listening to the words of his master.
 The man in black smiled.
 “If you didn’t know then I do not feel as blind,” he said.
 “He will surpass me.

Alec gazed at me for several seconds, and then sighed.
 "If you would like to come watch, you may.
 Give us half an hour, and then ask Donovan to show you the way."
 I felt my face break into a huge smile, but he held a hand up to forestall my thanks.
 "This is all still very much against my better judgment, but I'm finding it increasingly hard to refuse you the things you want the most."
 "Somehow I find that hard to believe.
 Even if it were true, you're hardly the type to give away the upper hand by coming out and telling me so."
 Alec's eyes had taken on the serious, resigned expression that'd become disturbingly commonplace lately.
 "I know.
 I think that last part bothers me the most, but I find myself doing so nevertheless.

Alec's pause was long enough that I think I nodded off, but the sound of his voice once he resumed talking pulled me back awake.
 "Originally there were just two of the moonborn, a pair of brothers called Adjam and Inock.
 Unbeknown to the Moon, the Earth had anticipated his great gesture of love, and sent forth a plague upon the land.
 As Adjam, the elder of the brothers, descended from the heavens and touched down upon the Earth, he collapsed to the ground in pain.
 Despite his agony as the very bones of his body rearranged themselves, he managed to call out a warning to Inock, to flee back to the Moon.
 The love of Inock for Adjam was so great that he rushed to his brother's side, where he too fell victim to the Earth's plague."
 I wanted so very badly to remain awake, but wrapped comfortably in the warmth of Alec's arms, I couldn't fight off exhaustion any longer, and I felt myself drift off into dreams of two brothers who survived the plague, rising from the ground after seven days, one a wolf, the other a jaguar.
 Chapter 24 I'd been awake for several minutes before I finally remembered where I was.
 I rolled over, opened my eyes, groaning when I saw that the other side of the bed was empty.
 Who knew what Alec thought.

I thought of marriage, and that was when I saw what Eric was.
 He was the wind.
 You can't tie the wind up and put it in a house and make it love you.
 How I wanted to be with him until we were so old and fragile that I would have broken had he put his arm around me.
 "Even though I never had that, we had something much finer.
 We went to the beach many times and talked until we were too hoarse to say anything.
 I brought out things about him I thought I never could.
 We would run down the beach, I don't know where to, but we'd run and swim and laugh and laugh until we laughed at nothing at all.
 "And then summer ended.
 There were so many things left undone.

“But it does not matter!” he continued, his voice flowing with reassurance.
 “I have knowledge that the half-lings have entered our world and our grasp.
 The dwarf may have done us a favor, bringing them here, without knowing it.
 My help, my prize travels with them.
 He will bring us to victory, the half-ling boy!” The crowd roared louder than ever, fueled by the thought of victory.
 Anger rose inside me with every word Kojas said.
 Seth would not help them and the dwarf didn't make a mistake.
 The only one making the mistake was Kojas.
 The crowd fell silent as he said, “We will find them and kill them.
 Than nothing will be in our way!” My disbelief grew and a single howl sounded above all.

This isn't open to discussion.
 We're taking her back to Brandon and asking for leniency."
 In an effort to see better, Rachel and I had moved slightly to the side.
 Alec reached back without looking and moved us directly behind him.
 It wasn't until his arm brushed me that I realized he was shaking ever so slightly himself.
 "There's only one way you're going to touch her, James.
 Are you really ready to take that step?"
 I felt shivers run down me as I realized just how easily everything could boil over into deadly violence.
 The tension in the room pulsed out in waves, skittering many-legged across my skin like something that belonged under a rock somewhere.
 The feeling intensified even more as first Jessica and then Jasmin picked up the same strange, near epileptic quiver.

What could one do?
 Power, in the end, is just another word, too, but the power is gonna belong to someone, so, in the end, who decides?
 Who decides Nixon has more power than Mao, or John Lennon has more power than Roy Cohn?
 You dig?
 I was wrestling with these things, absurd things, but I couldn’t see clearly.
 All I saw was blackness, the blackness of dried blood.
 I don’t know what Crafty and Skippy thought—I didn’t even leave them a note.
 I feel bad about it now—and this, finally, I think, was what pissed Crafty off and led him to hire a lawyer for himself, to try and, you know, basically, steal my material.
 It was like, if you’re not gonna represent yourself well, we’re gonna take away your soul, all your work, all your history.

Second, granted that the market works effectively for mature capitalist societies with high levels of technology, education, productivity, living standards and food surpluses, and relatively small portions of the workforce dependent on agriculture, is the same necessarily true for countries at an earlier stage of development, in which (1) a majority of the workforce is dependent on agriculture for sustenance, (2) levels of education, productivity and incomes are low, and (3) any increase in food prices can have a devastating impact on food consumption levels in the country?
 The answers to these questions are relevant both to the countries presently making the transition from centrally planned to market economies in Eastern Europe and to poorer developing countries striving to achieve food security.
 Nations accord special status to their agricultural sector for several reasons.
 Continuous supplies of food are absolutely essential to the welfare of the population.
 Food prices are extremely sensitive to changes in the supply of foodstuffs.
 Even a small increase or decrease in supply can lead to a very wide fluctuation in prices.
 A bumper harvest can depress prices to the point of bankrupting large numbers of farmers.
 A poor harvest can send food prices soaring beyond the purchasing power of large numbers of people.
 Buffer stocks, subsidies and incentives are used to protect agriculture from sharp price fluctuations.
 Al though the principles of free trade argue that countries should produce only those items in which they possess a competitive advantage and procure the rest from overseas, few nations are willing to entrust their food supply entirely or even substantially to foreign parties.

I managed to think about something other than creatures that go bump in the night as I drifted off to sleep.
 In the morning I changed and ran down stairs and left a note saying I was going out to eat with Jason, Emily and Seth.
 It took me minutes to speed down to the small breakfast restaurant in town.
 I chained up my bike and walked over to the plastic blue table my friends had occupied.
 I slid in next to Emily, who was talking about some book she had read recently.
 Jason, who sat next to her, was pretending to be fascinated by her rant.
 Emily stopped in mid-sentence when she noticed me sitting beside her.
 “Jazell, you’re here!” she exclaimed.
 “Is it true, did you take on a monster by yourself yesterday?” I sighed, shooting a look at Seth.
 “Yes it is.

This trend, if not halted and reversed, casts a renewed spell of gloom over the hopes of hundreds of millions of people to escape from hunger, and over all our hopes for peace in the twenty-first century.
 The projection of future prospects based on past trends is especially questionable with regard to food.
 Not even some of the most prominent agricultural economists expected the gains in food production which have occurred in the past several decades.
 An international team of experts visiting India in 1963 projected a mere 10 per cent growth in foodgrain production by 1970, whereas growth actually achieved during this period was 50 per cent.
 Neither technological, nor financial nor natural resources pose insurmountable obstacles to achieving dramatically more over the next 15 years than is indicated by past trends or current projections.
 The idea that hunger cannot be conquered because we are running out of land to support rapidly burgeoning populations is contradicted by the facts.
 Globally, there is no correlation between population density and hunger.
 China, with only half as much arable land per capita as India, produces 13 per cent more foodgrains per capita.
 Taiwan and South Korea have only half the farmland per capita of Bangladesh, yet they produce 40 per cent more food per capita.
 Tiny Netherlands, with the highest population density in the world, produces more than sufficient food to feed itself and remain a large net food exporter.

Now, during and since my trip north, I often see people more clearly.
 I'm better at seeing God in the sorrow of a destitute fellow, one of those folks Hank Williams called "men with broken hearts", or in the patient nod of a sales clerk as I decide whether to buy a magazine, or in a woman's kind smile.
 When I need a break from work or chores, and sometimes while reading or praying, I sit on the back porch like my mom used to do.
 The view was the reason she gave for not selling the house after I left home.
 As I sit and gaze toward the Mexican border, I think of Eric, and how we used to peer through twilight and try to locate his home in the valley about five miles closer to Mexico.
 Which reminds me of Sylvia and how the cruelty of the world drove her crazy, and I wonder if turning to Jesus might have cured her, if she had let him expel her bitterness.
 Because for those who fail to discover peace and even joy in the midst of the cruelty, going mad is only sensible.
 I imagine Eric sitting beside me, wearing the same face as after he pinned me to his living room floor, just before he coached me to believe in myself no matter the evidence that I was a loser.
 Then the expression changes to the one I imagine him wearing when he told Kenny they needed to leave for the desert without Billy and me.
 I get a crazy idea I have never considered before.

Brandon became sicker every day that his frail body went without the Oxy it craved to survive.
 Brandon had lived away from our house for over a year and he looked like a ghost of himself.
 His eyes were dark, his enthusiastic personality was gone and his mind seemed permanently altered.
 He was 23 years old, 6’ 2” and his weight was hovering at a skeletal 130 pounds.
 We had Brandon on complete lockdown at our house with no visitors allowed, searching his room and the entire house daily.
 We ordered professional quality drug tests so we could test him every day.
 Brandon experienced the worst of the drug withdrawals in the first few days after his arrest.
 My wife, Lisa sat on the bathroom floor with him during his lowest moments.
 He vomited until he had nothing left.
 He curled up in the fetal position, chanting inaudible ramblings and contorting to the point that we had to pad the doorframe and cabinets with towels to keep him from banging his head and limbs.

It was hard to decide whether my excitement at seeing the biggest jerk I'd ever met humbled outweighed my dislike for Alec, who'd pretty much locked up the honor of being the second biggest jerk.
 A surge of dread washed through me as Vincent backed closer to the wall in an effort to maintain his distance from Alec.
 I half expected for the incredible tension I'd been feeling before to disappear, but instead it morphed slightly.
 If I hadn't known it was absolutely absurd, I would've said it felt like there was a tingly wind blowing down the stairs, pushing Vincent along before it.
 Isaac moved slightly.
 It was a small change of position, but somehow incredibly menacing.
 It wasn't until Vincent froze in place that I realized Isaac's shift had kept Vincent squarely between him and Alec.
 It was like watching a pair of wolves bringing down an elk.
 I'd seen gangs work together like this before, but it seemed strangely out of place in Sanctuary.
 I was positive there was going to be a fight after all, but then Vincent grabbed some poor freshman, shoved him into Isaac, and pushed his way downstairs as Isaac caught the human missile.

“But—” “Okay, well, sure, you can lead an animal.
 You can turn your horse and guide him on the path, but that is simply pushing their heads and encouraging them with the click of your heels.
 You can’t make them choose to take you; it just doesn’t work that way.
 You can’t get into an animal’s mind and make them behave the way you want them to.” “But the dogs… wolves… follow them.
 They had them do a demonstration and—” “No, Frey.
 The wolves do not follow the elves.
 The wolves protect them by choice.” “By choice?” “Yes.
 And I have seen them tear an elf apart as quickly as defend them.” I shivered.
 “Rhys and Rider were saved by the wolves once.
 They think the animals understand.

He tilted her face up so that their lips were almost touching.
 "So did I."
 She felt his breath in her mouth.
 "I can tell."
 He nibbled at her lips.
 "I was very proud of you tonight."
 "Really?"
 She clutched at his shoulders, her breath coming faster.
 "Yeah."
 He wove his fingers into her hair and began pressing kisses along her neck.

Harruq said nothing.
 He fought back his swelling anger and panic.
 “I don’t understand what Aurelia sees in you,” Dieredon continued.
 “You murdered the children and gave them to your brother.
 You’re the Forest Butcher.
 Admit it so I may kill you.”
 “I will admit no such thing,” Harruq said, his jaw trembling.
 “You’re guessing.”
 “I have also seen your brother meeting the strange man in black of the ever- changing face.

Probably for hours if she could get away with it.
 "I'm glad you feel the same.
 You'd think they'd be a little more welcoming.
 Instead it's like they go out of their way to make sure you know you don't really fit in.
 We've been here a year, and I still can't get invited to any of the really cool parties."
 I'd never been invited to any parties, let alone cool ones.
 I'd never felt the lack too strongly, but I smiled and let Britney keep talking until Mr. Whethers realized it was time to start class.
 I quickly gathered we'd be reading Wuthering Heights, a prospect that both elated and disappointed me.
 After seeing how far behind I was already in Biology, it was nice to know we'd be working on something I'd already been through twice.
 On the other hand I hadn't liked the novel the first time I'd read it, and when I'd gritted my teeth and sat down for a second attempt I'd found I liked it even less.

He slammed his blades down with all his might.
 The elf blocked once, twice, then three times, wincing each time he did.
 Then the other elf was behind Harruq, stabbing at his back.
 While mad with rage, Harruq still knew very well where his opponents were.
 He spun, avoiding the thrust, and then trapped his assailant’s arm with his elbow.
 A flex of his muscles cracked bone, and the sword fell from a limp hand.
 Harruq let him go, bellowed at the first elf, and then hurled both his blades.
 They turned end over end through the air, one missing, one not.
 The one that missed sailed until it hit ground and bounced.
 The hilt of the one that did not smacked him hard in the forehead.

How could he put his wants above hers?
 Standing up, he raked his fingers through his hair.
 Marie looked up at him with concern.
 "Are you all right?"
 "No."
 He closed his eyes.
 "What would you say if I told you you could go home tomorrow?"
 "I'd jump for joy.
 Why?"
 He squeezed the back of his chair, refusing to look at her.

The bushes and trees rattled and then the woods were silent.
 I could hear everyone's heavy breaths as we turned to face each other.
 Well, actually everyone turned to me.
 “So,” I said and wiped the sweat off my knife's handle, “that was something, wasn't it?” Emily put her hands on her hips.
 “Jazell, how the heck did you know how to kill those things?” She shook her head.
 “What were those things?” “Syphons,” I said.
 “I don't know how I knew where to stab them.
 I just did, alright?
 It was weird.” Seth shook his head and leaned against a tree.
 “How come you get some random power when the rest of us don't?” He gave me a fake pout.

Was she stuck here?
 Her parents must be out of their minds with fear.
 And Davis--he was probably tearing the city apart looking for her.
 Or would after he'd finished work for the day.
 Now where had that uncharitable thought come from?
 Davis loved her.
 And she adored him.
 If she couldn't find a way back, she'd never see him again.
 He'd marry somebody else.
 And she'd .

"So, what's going to happen now?
 I mean with Brandon's pack?
 Everyone seemed really worried last night."
 "I'm not sure.
 Not really.
 It won't be straightforward; nothing involving Brandon ever is.
 His pack is bigger, but we've always had the laws on our side before this..." Rachel broke off as my eyes got bigger.
 "Sorry, that's touching on some of the things I'm not supposed to tell you."
 I shrugged, pretending indifference.
 "How soon will we know if it's really bad or just a little bad?"

Improving the quality and quantity of productive skills is essential to implementing the strategies for peace, democratization, food security, economic growth and full employment set forth in this report.
 The phenomenal growth of East Asian countries is the direct result of their massive investments in upgrading the skills of the workforce.
 Rather than generating excess workers, rising productivity has generated greater demand for labour.
 Labour productivity in South Korea rose 11 per cent per year between 1963 and 1979, mostly due to investment in education and skills.
 This increase has been accompanied by a growing shortage of labour, equivalent to 1 per cent of the workforce in 1991.
 Investment in education and training helped Thailand raise labour productivity by 63 per cent during 1980–5.
 It, too, is moving from a labour surplus to a labour shortage economy.
 An enormous range and depth of physical, technical, organizational, managerial and social skills are needed in order to utilize constructively the freedom which democracy provides, the productive power of new technologies, and the efficiency of modern institutions and systems to achieve greater developmental results.
 These skills admit of constant and continuous improvement without limit, in the same way that technology and organization can always be further improved.
 A comparative survey of the level and quality of skills in any country with those of countries above and below it on scales of economic and human development will reveal the crucial role of skills in development.

A shadow formed behind them and I screamed for them to turn around.
 “What the heck?” Seth shouted and pointed.
 Oh snap.
 Chapter 10
 Emily and Jason dashed back to our sides as the shadow became a body.
 It was bigger than the dragon we had rode.
 It had the body of a huge cockroach but its tail was a giant stinger.
 Large, bat wings were holding it up in the air.
 “What is it?” I asked.
 I turned to Emily and said, “Emily, you know anything about this creature?” She looked pale.

She had her brown hair woven into a tight braid and wore well fitting chain and leather armor.
 Her sword and shield seemed to be of excellent quality.
 Rodregas tried to get a good hold on his shield.
 It was battered and not looking good.
 The top of its handle was loose.
 His sword was possibly worse with chips and a crack starting high up.
 As the two circled each other, Rodregas’ realized that his first impression, that she was of the blood was clearly true.
 She was both quicker and stronger than a normal human.
 She was also highly skilled, and while not as physically gifted as Rodregas, she was powerful.
 She was also clearly intelligent.

By the time the actual dance arrives, everyone who is anyone will have a date, most of them picked out by the girl weeks before the boy even started thinking about the dance."
 There wasn't really any bitterness in her voice, but there was something, maybe the same kind of longing I felt when I talked about Prom.
 "You're probably right.
 That would fit with what I know of Britney so far."
 "Do you need us to give you a ride?"
 I looked over and saw that James was once again glaring at me, somehow having approached to within a few feet without making any noise.
 "I should probably make sure she isn't waiting somewhere for me.
 That's probably half of why she's so mad.
 I was so out of things yesterday I didn't think to let her know I was headed home with you."
 Rachel looked for a moment like she wanted to disagree, but she nodded, in the kind of noncommittal way people use when they don't really agree, but are ready to let you make your own mistakes.

“Shall I find their bodies and bring them to you?”
 “For now,” Qurrah said.
 “Yes.
 If the death is fresh, the power should still linger.”
 Harruq reached out, grabbed his brother’s wrist, and clasped his hands in his.
 “I won’t like it,” he said.
 “But I’ll do it for you.”
 “We are better than them,” Qurrah said, standing so he could look through the cracks of the boards across the broken door.
 “Stronger.
 Life is for those who take it.

Harruq nodded, yanking harder on the knot that held the noble’s hands behind his back.
 He was on his knees, his silk outfit stained by grass and dirt.
 Blood ran from where Harruq had broken his nose.
 “Name a price, name it, anything, just name it!”
 Harruq glanced at Qurrah, who only chuckled louder.
 “We have little need for riches, noble.
 All we want is you.”
 The man paled.
 “Me?
 What do you want me for?

I forced my eyes open and found Ruby, Steed, and Chevelle.
 They looked for a moment as if they were suffering my pain… and then I realized the pain was gone, the siren was silenced.
 My breathing steadied, the fear abating, and their faces relaxed.
 Relief washed their expressions, but their postures remained stiff, alert.
 I pushed up to find the source of the danger and dizziness incapacitated me.
 They rushed to kneel beside me and I could see that was how they had been before my gasp had moved them to standing.
 My throat was too raw to speak, so Chevelle gave me a canteen.
 I would have taken anything, but I was glad it was water, not hot wine or that foul-tasting elixir.
 “What happened?” I finally choked out, but they were tight-lipped.
 “How do you feel?” Chevelle asked.

She was the mom of three wonderful kids and the wife of a loving husband.
 In horror, she returned to intense and persistent prayer, telling God he couldn’t possibly mean she should leave her family, could he?
 Rather than reply with words, he used silence, like Tae Kwon Do Master Jeong used to do when one of us students offered an excuse for not training often enough.
 For weeks she waited, listened, and prayed God would at last reply that he had only been using the method through which he tested Abraham’s willingness to obey at any cost.
 Once she declared herself ready to forsake her family, he would release her from the need to do so.
 But he didn’t release her.
 She gathered together her husband and kids, all of whom she adored and treasured.
 The kids were age 9, 12, and 15.
 She told them she needed to leave.
 At first they didn’t believe her.

Ravenhurr, however, was the kind of man who demanded perfection.
 He demanded it both in himself and from those around him.
 That perfection required no less than an exact replication of the ceremony.
 As usual, he acceded to his master's wishes and did as he was told.
 He knew the value of following orders and it had kept him alive so far.
 When he placed his hand on the tower door an involuntary shudder racked his body at the idea of following those orders one more time.
 He looked over again at the AElven maiden.
 To an exotic beauty like her a balding overweight man like himself would be invisible under normal circumstances.
 Some of the other guards might be tempted to take what would not be given, but not him.
 Like his mother always told him, a person did not have to own a beautiful sunset to enjoy watching it.

Even as she thought it, she opened her mouth a bit.
 Rick's tongue darted inside.
 And the flame that it created shot through her entire body, surprising her with its power and heat.
 Her body ached with a pleasure that seemed too intense to bear.
 Intoxicated, she wrapped her arms around Rick’s neck, moaning.
 Powerfully aroused by that moan, Rick slid one hand down her back to press her closer.
 She shuddered with pleasure as he began kissing her neck.
 He undid the first button on her dress.
 "I want you, Marie," he rasped, raising his head to look into her eyes.
 Marie gazed into his eyes for a moment.

"Why don't we go home so you can rest since you have to go to work tomorrow?"
 "It's still early."
 "We've been here several hours already.
 Let's go home and read the paper and nap and order a pizza tonight.
 Then maybe you won't feel tired tomorrow."
 He slid his arm around her waist, pulling her against him.
 "I love you so much," he said as he bent to kiss her.
 They went home, but Rick couldn't read, couldn't rest, wasn't hungry.
 All he could do was think about how much he loved Marie, how desperately he wanted her to stay here and marry him.
 The thought of her walking through the garden, back into 1927, out of his life forever .

Voices echoed through the open door.
 He was in the main room.
 Chevelle was there, too.
 My mouth tasted sour.
 I tried to sit up but my head spun.
 Before I’d moved an inch I was back down.
 My pulse pounded in my temples as I struggled to recall what had happened the night before.
 I hissed out a low oath when I remembered Ruby leaning toward me, blowing her glitter in my face.
 My eyes opened again to find Chevelle offering me a glass.
 I winced, unsure of what exactly I had said to him.

She ran to her house, tearing open the door and dashing upstairs.
 She paused at her room long enough to toss her bag onto her bed and then dashed to her parents' room.
 "Mother!
 Father!"
 She banged on the door.
 The door opened, and her father stared at her in shock.
 Her mother, however, jumped out of bed with a cry of joy and threw her arms around Marie.
 "Marie!
 You're all right!
 I can't believe you're all right!"

Eradicating the Roots of Terrorism: Terrorism is not new to the world, but with the withdrawal of national rivalries between East and West, violence by non-nation states has increased in intensity and is viewed as a far greater security concern by the entire world.
 This has spurred an unprecedented international effort to control and suppress terrorist activity.
 But there is little hope of abolishing this menace without simultaneously comprehending and addressing the root causes of terrorism in the world today.
 In a sense, the human urge for violence has neither increased nor decreased.
 It has simply shifted the field of expression from confrontation between nation states to confrontation between powerful governments and disenchanted, disenfranchised groups of individuals who respond to the application of superior power by nation states with the application of indiscriminate violence against the public-at-large.
 Terrorism thrives in the absence of effective democratic institutions to give voice to the will of its citizens.
 At the same time, lifting the tyranny of state terrorism has itself become the occasion in some instances for an outburst of violence by long suppressed groups.
 Eradication of terrorism is possible, but it demands a comprehensive and integrated approach and concerted, collective action.
 The commercialization of the arms trade – which benefits some countries economically at the expense of the security of all nations – must be subject to rigorous monitoring and control by international agencies.
 Vested economic interests that thrive on conflict must be placed under UN surveillance and regulation.

Its diameter had been drawn as large as possible within the limitations of the roof’s edges.
 On the inside were sigils, runes, and small candles set out every few feet.
 Rodregas knew enough of magic to understand that the purpose of this circle was to keep out unwanted magical influences.
 They could interfere with the spell casting inside the circle.
 Also, the circle would hold in any magical forces inside which someone wanted to store or manipulate.
 Inside the large circle were four smaller circles.
 Rodregas’ eyes immediately went to the one on the north side made of blue sand, where inside sigils made of a yellow waxy substance laid a giant lion.
 This was not a normal lion such as those found in the nearby forest, but a giant beast.
 Ravenhurr had been lucky indeed.
 He had been able to buy several Dire Cats from the Immortalist Guild dealer Taiga.

“We must fall back to the forest.
 If they chase us there, it will be suicide.”
 “We will not have to fall back so far,” Felewen disagreed.
 “They have scattered about our town.
 Their numbers mean nothing now.
 Besides,” she grinned, “we have Aurelia Thyne.”
 Both bowed politely.
 “Never could we have used a mage’s power more than now,” one said.
 Aurelia blushed and waved him off.

 Summer vacation’s supposed to be fun, right?
 I wish I had a better answer to that question.
 Starlings, New York is not the place you’d expect much to happen.
 It’s a small quiet town, the kind where everyone knows your name.
 It’s a place where your parents wouldn’t even care if you stayed out late biking with your friends.

He paused.
 "I'm sorry.
 I shouldn't have kissed you like that.
 I just love you so much, sweetheart.
 I don't want to lose you."
 When he didn't get a response, he turned toward the stairs with a sigh.
 He'd known exactly what he was doing when he'd kissed her, and he'd known it was unfair.
 He couldn't blame her for being angry.
 Marie wanted to throw something.
 Or hit something.

Everything was done in drab, painfully boring colors, overlaid with incredibly vibrant, hues that were almost unreal in their perfection.
 It wasn't until I'd moved around a corner and entered what looked like a new phase for the painter that I figured out why the paintings looked so familiar despite the fact that I'd never seen any of the places or people depicted.
 The realization hit with such force that it distracted me from the familiarity of the signature.
 The new pieces were all breathtaking.
 The drab colors were gone, leaving scenes made up of multi-hued strands of light.
 It was like waking up and having someone tell you they'd been reading your mind.
 The pieces weren't of specific places or events from my dreams, but they were an exact match for how they'd looked and felt.
 I felt my hands start to shake.
 It was like I'd had too much forced on me too quickly.
 I wanted to just collapse and let unconsciousness overcome me, but something pulled me onward towards the next series of pictures, and then the next after that.

"But we're going to the shore."
 "I'll show you when we get home.
 Come on--let's go buy you some more outfits."
 He insisted on buying her a pair of pants, a dress, two t-shirts, and two pairs of shorts.
 "But Rick, what if I get back to 1927 tomorrow?"
 she protested as he paid the salesgirl.
 "Don't worry.
 I'll save the clothes for the next girl from 1927 who wanders into my garden."
 As he handed her one of the bags, he saw the consternation on her face.
 "I'm sorry, Marie," he told her as they left the store.

 An hour before dawn, the city’s soldiers cornered and killed the last of the orcs.
 The Tun brothers were not there to watch, for they had snuck back to the outer wall at Qurrah’s insistence.
 “I know his plans,” Qurrah whispered as they stared across the open grass and the arrow-pierced orc bodies that covered it.
 “He is familiar to me, though I know him not.”
 “He isn’t your former master, is he?” Harruq asked as he adjusted his newly acquired swords.
 He had taken a belt and some sheathes from one of the dead bodies, but he was having a devil of a time getting them to fit correctly.
 “No,” Qurrah said.
 “He is dead.
 I killed him.

 I finally got one of my hands wrapped around one of his fingers, but it wasn’t enough to free myself.
 I believed it was going to be over soon and I was going to die.
 I could see him clearly now that my eyes had adjusted to the darkness, and he looked like a madman just inches from my face as he continued to push me up against the door.
 He didn’t mutter a word from his gritted teeth.
 I don’t even know if my feet were on the ground.
 I must have passed out because I don’t remember what happened next.
 I awoke in the entryway and he was gone.
 I rolled to my knees and I could hear the crackle of the puka shells beneath the weight of my body.

“What do we do about all the blood?” he asked.
 “We will clean it, but first we must drain the body.”
 The two dug through dressers upstairs, grabbing old and expensive robes and shirts.
 They then dragged the body outside to where the deceased elf had kept a private garden.
 Thick brick walls guarded against any prying eyes.
 They dug a large hole in a corner and then bled the body dry, letting the fluids soak into the dirt.
 Occasionally, they would halt and listen, worried their violent struggle had reached unwanted ears.
 No curious investigators arrived, however, and they continued with their dark deed.
 When the blood dripping from the elf’s wounds became but a trickle, they filled the hole and moved on.
 Using the clothes and robes from upstairs, the two brothers wiped away as much of Ahrqur’s blood as they could.

Peace
 Olga Savitsky was a poet.
 We met at a small church charismatic enough so that nobody minded when she stood in the midst of a service and offered her latest poem.
 Long ago, Olga had discovered that what she needed most was God.
 She would hike and pray her way up Cowles Mountain, a mile and a half of rocky trail, then call her best friend Warren so they could pray together, sometimes for hours.
 Then she might go to work, cleaning somebody’s home while listening to worship music.
 God, God, God.
 Here is another of her poems, a simple one I’m choosing because you can also find it on Youtube, read by my Zoë: Jesus, in the night you are my nightlight.
 Jesus, in the morning you are my daylight.
 Jesus, in the afternoon you are my sunlight.

The door to the home behind him exploded into splinters as a huge projectile shot through it.
 The elf spun, his eyes widening as he saw what had shattered the door: a massacred elven body.
 He readied his bow and released an arrow at the next sign of movement.
 Unfortunately, it was another elven body, curiously missing its left arm and leg.
 An enormous half-orc in black armor followed, soaked in blood and roaring in mindless fury.
 He spotted Antonil’s attacker, screamed an incomprehensible challenge, and then charged.
 The elf fired another arrow but was horrified to see it sail high.
 Behind him, Antonil delivered another kick, this time aiming for the elf’s knee instead of his bow.
 The elf had to dodge the kick, and that dodge was all it took.
 The half-orc swung his glowing black blades, cutting his bow, and his body, in twain.

Setting goals to achieve minimum needs ensures that the minimum is the most we will accomplish.
 Seeking to tap the maximum potentials challenges us to strive unceasingly for higher goals.
 The world possesses the technology, resources and organizational abilities needed to eradicate poverty from the globe.
 Positing material constraints becomes a justification for non-action.
 The true constraints are not material, but psychological and social.
 Recognizing the real barriers will help us overcome them.
 Human beings are our most creative, productive and precious resource.
 Human capacity increases the more it is drawn upon.
 It can never be exhausted.
 Developing the human resource should be the centrepiece of all development strategy.

If I'd found her standing in front of a broken window with a rock in her hand, and she'd told me she had no idea why the window had shattered, all the while flashing me that look, I would've believed her.
 Mrs. Tiggs apparently wasn't quite so gullible.
 "It's a reasonable question, as the two subjects are highly related.
 One could almost say they're so close to the same thing that any distinction is purely arbitrary."
 Now Dominic looked both innocent and confused.
 "But why are they so far apart in the book then?
 I mean my Spanish book in the school before I came here had them pretty widely spaced too."
 It was masterful.
 I'm not even sure the rest of the class realized the pattern, but Mrs. Tiggs caught on about halfway through the hour.
 Every time she was snippy with me, Dominic made her look like the idiot we all suspected she was.

I tried to think quickly, to keep the anger from slowing my response.
 Using magic to pull Chevelle’s horse by the tail, I ran after him, hoping to leap on.
 A tree branch came from nowhere and smacked me flat across the face.
 Chevelle’s horse whinnied as they rode away.
 “Why always the face?” I yelled at his back.
 I winced as a second branch, this one young and green and more like a lash, struck me from behind.
 A fierce growl escaped me and I took off, running at full speed in the direction my horse had gone.
 By midday, I was completely spent.
 I had eventually caught my horse, but the training hadn’t let up.
 I was too exhausted for any anger to remain, but I had the sneaking suspicion Chevelle was enjoying my “lessons.” We stopped by a patch of snow that had gathered in a rock basin, warming it to water for the horses.

None of which helped me figure out where I'd seen him before.
 He wasn't a regular at the tutor lab, and didn't have the hectic, desperate look of someone cramming for a test.
 Instead he looked completely at ease sitting in one of the no-man's-land tables with a pair of books open in front of him.
 By the looks of things he wasn't going to need any help.
 Once it was just the four of us, Britney waved me over and held up her homework.
 "I don't get it.
 What is the answer to this one?"
 I shook my head in exasperation.
 "Me telling you the answers won't help you on the test.
 If you have a specific question about how to work a problem I'd be more than happy to help you, but I'm not going to do your homework for you."

As his sword struck her staff, the sparring began.
 Aurelia was familiar with her staff, the wood comfortable in her grip.
 She had no sense of tactic, though, and all it took was a quick feint or two before she left herself horribly open.
 Harruq used only one sword, running it in slow circles, stabs, and the occasional feint.
 He enjoyed the steady workout but savored even more watching Aurelia move gracefully through the air.
 Whenever his eyes lingered too long, however, he’d feel the sharp sting of Aurelia’s staff against his arms or chest.
 When they finished, Harruq slumped onto his rear and rubbed his bruises.
 “I shouldn’t be able to hit you,” Aurelia said as she sat across from him, her legs tucked underneath her.
 “Yeah, so?” Harruq asked.
 “So tomorrow don’t let me hit you,” she said.

My father has taken Freya from me.
 He has assigned her tasks, Rune watching over her, testing her.
 It’s just as Junnie feared—just what he’d done to my mother.
 I will find a way to stop him.
 ~ The elders are keeping Freya now.
 Guards have been assigned to me.
 Like a prison.
 ~ I killed three guards to get to her.
 We only had a moment before I was torn away from her, yet I feel I got the message through.
 ~ She came to see me last night.

So, this is typical thing to wake up to.
 I stood up and walked over to Seth.
 He looked up from the ground and saw my troubled face.
 “What's wrong, Jazell?” “I need to speak to you,” I said in a low voice, “alone.” Seth nodded in understanding and I followed him out of the cave.
 We stood off to the side near the edge of the cliff where Emily and Jason couldn't see us.
 For a minute, I didn't say anything because I didn't know what to say.
 I hesitated, but knew that if I told anyone about the dream, it would be Seth.
 So what was the point in waiting?
 “I had a dream last night,” I began.
 “Only it wasn't really a dream, but more of a vision.” Seth nodded.

King, man.
 He was comparing me to blues royalty.
 It made me dizzy, I’ll tell you.
 I mean I was in high school.
 I think that’s when I started leaving Memphis.
 In a way.
 That’s when I got kind of a big head and dreamt of things beyond.
 I certainly had left Central High School, left my friends, my girlfriends.
 Even before we cut the album.

“Soap.” I had been reduced to one-word sentences.
 “Oh.” He nodded, leaning back.
 “She does have a way with potions and such.” “I enjoy the mixing,” Ruby said, startling me again as she entered the house.
 “But not to worry, I keep it contained to elements and minerals, no breeding.
 I leave that to Steed.” She laughed at her own words as she passed us on the way to her room.
 I found myself reevaluating her now that I knew she was Steed’s sister.
 Chevelle noticed me watching her.
 “Do you mind staying with Ru—” My expression cut him off.
 “I have some business to take care of outside of town.
 She has given me her word she will behave.” He eyed her as he spoke, a warning.

 Anyway, you heard it here first.
 That’s me, man, Jimi Mumu.
 I love that little 45.
 If you can find one, Dad, it’s worth some money, I hear.
 After Laughing Buddha folded, you know.
 Hey, I got some here—Lor, get a copy of “Don’t Ever Antagonize the Horn” for Creole.
 A little something for your reading public, man, for the fans.
 I can still cook, Daddy, believe it.
 Check out that bridge—that “rave up.”  I was really playing that instrumental part like it’s a jazz chart, see, stretching it out—that’s psychedelia, I guess.

When he plugged in he changed music, but he can’t plug in again, you know?
 And he went backwards after that, because he’s the jester, man, and by going backwards, like Merlin, he was going forward.
 Dylan’s always been a bellwether, though he hates that thought.
 I don’t want to be anyone’s bellwether, either.
 Bob told me once, he said, “You never play your old stuff.
 Man, I wish I could get away with that.”  See, he’s sick of “Like a Rolling Stone.”  He’s trapped, he feels trapped.
 In a way, in one way.
 In another it’s part of him so he can’t deny it, like you can’t deny your arm, or your soul.
 No, I’ll never play, “Young Avenue Blues” again, though it’s a great song.
 And I won’t let anyone else play it like it’s theirs.

Since 1990, the total number of military personnel worldwide has declined by two million or about six per cent.
 By 1998, a further decrease of at least two million is anticipated.
 A large proportion of these demobilized people have already joined, or will soon join, the forces of the unemployed.
 Some may be tempted to market their military skills elsewhere.
 Just as the present efforts of the UN to make and keep the peace are severely constrained by the lack of a standing professional military force under its own direction, so also the prodigious efforts of the UN’s development agencies to accelerate development among member countries is hampered by a lack of well-trained, disciplined and highly organized personnel for implementation, especially in those countries with the greatest need of assistance.
 The Commission recommends that, as a complement to the establishment of an International Force for Peace, an International Force for Development be constituted, comprised of former military personnel who, after appropriate training, will work to accelerate economic development to provide food, health, literacy and jobs for all.
 A UN Peace Force and UN Development Force, functioning under a democratically restructured UN, can make a lasting contribution to achieving the major goals of the UN system.
 Conclusion
 Seven years ago the threat of nuclear war between the superpowers loomed large in the minds of people everywhere.
 The euphoria generated by the end of the Cold War led to high expectations of peace and a ‘peace dividend’ the world over.

I decided to read all I could find on the subject of love.
 I read C.S.
 Lewis, Erich Fromm, Thomas Merton, and a dozen or so other books I came across or got led to, even the Kama Sutra.
 Then, supposing I knew as much about love as I ever would, I turned to reading mystery novels, since writing them had become my occupation.
 The Truth
 I mean to be hard on myself and dedicate these pages to honesty, even if it gets brutal.
 My beloved grandmother, Mary Garfield, often assured me that a liar was the worst of all people.
 No doubt she recognized how liars teach us not to trust.
 I believe it was Sylvia Curtis, when Eric and I talked to her about Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, who convinced me that Holden Caulfield was right to pour most of his wrath on phonies.
 When Olga Savitsky and I considered founding a church, we agreed that above the entrance would hang a sign, “No bullshit allowed.” After all, God is a matter of life and death.

 But, I’ve never changed direction, man.

I scanned through the first problem, and then picked up my pencil and got started.
 Having successfully finished my test with ten minutes to spare, I expected lunch to bring more of the same kind of anxiety that I'd just managed to push out of my mind.
 It was headed that way.
 Despite Britney's best efforts to distract me with a point-by-point analysis of what was going on with someone named Sandra, and the two boys she'd been leading on for the last month.
 I followed Britney through the lunch line, gripping my meal replacement drink with both hands.
 We sat down at our usual table, only to be surrounded a few seconds later by an energetic mob of familiar-looking people.
 It wasn't until Brandon slid into the seat next to me that I realized who everyone was.
 "We thought maybe we'd come join the two of you today.
 That shabby little corner where we always sit was getting a little old."
 Brandon's voice was smooth and flawless as always, but even that couldn't distract me enough to miss the flash of dislike in Cassie's eyes as she sat down next to Britney.

Brandon's voice had been like silk caressing my face when I'd answered the phone.
 One minute I was minding my own business trying to pretend like I didn't notice the nasty looks some of Brandon's friends were shooting my way when they thought I wasn't looking, the next I was going to the biggest dance of the year with the most popular guy in school.
 I'd half thought Cassie was going to rip out my throat.
 I walked past a pair of gorgeous, gold-fringed drapes, handed my ticket to a distinguished-looking man in a uniform, and then smiled as he pointed me towards my door.
 It was almost a relief to be around strangers again.
 He'd been polite, but hadn't tried to fawn over me.
 My being asked out had changed my treatment from almost every girl at school.
 Half the student body, the more sensible portion it seemed, had all decided that I was some kind of massively stuck-up slut.
 The other half had decided they needed to be my new best friend if they wanted to get invited to any of the cool parties ever again.
 It might not have bothered me except the girls who now hated me were the ones I generally would've gotten along with, at least as much as I ever got along with anyone.

She was still in 2011.
 "Rick!"
 She could hear him hurrying toward her, and she turned to meet him.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, hugging her close.
 Tears rolled down her cheeks, and she choked back a sob.
 She missed her mother.
 She loved television and the microwave and blue jeans, but she wanted to exclaim over them with her mother.
 And she wanted to cuddle up next to Davis as they watched television together.
 Her father would buy them one.
 Well, if there were televisions in 1927, he would.

But oddly enough, she liked it.
 The big bathrobe almost reached her ankles, and she felt quite comfortable as she picked up her dress and wet clothing and went across the hall to the bedroom.
 She found hangers in the closet and hung her clothes there.
 But once she was in bed, the dreamlike feeling dissolved.
 She was far, far away from home, in a strange place, and she didn't know if she'd ever get back.
 Tears trickled down her cheeks as she drew her knees up under the covers, her back against the headboard.
 She was too frightened to go to sleep.
 Walking in the garden was no longer safe--was sleeping?
 Would she wake up to-- A knock at the door startled her.
 "Y-yes?"

Those who wield national power must come to realize that force of compulsion will not bring about a permanent reconciliation and amelioration of relationships in human affairs.
 Superior power must bring with it a superior sense of fairness and a commitment to constructive dialogue and action to attack the root causes of terrorism.
 It must shed its own accretion of mental insincerity cloaked as diplomacy.
 Then and then only these movements of violence will shrink and finally disappear.
 The period following September 11th, as US National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice put it, is one “not just of grave danger, but of enormous opportunity.”
 Resolving Local Conflicts: The Commission concluded that the end of the Cold War made it possible to successfully resolve problems that had resisted solution for decades, such as the many violent communal and ethnic conflicts occurring in the world.
 The near total cessation of violence in North Ireland during the past 10 years is proof that rapid progress can be made on issues involving apparently intractable communal sentiments.
 This achievement appears astounding to those who lived through the earlier decades of religious violence and until recently found it nearly impossible to imagine a mitigation of the conflict in the foreseeable future.
 We would do well to examine closely this instance to draw lessons that may aid in addressing those conflicts that continue to defy resolution.
 The most striking lesson of the Irish experience is that rapid development absorbs and dissipates the urge for violence.

These Knights traded their honor for near immortality in the Guards.
 The Immortal Guards were all sigil warriors with one or several magical enhancements.
 They also had the best resources of the entire Eastern Realm, the most powerful enchanted armor, the best weapons; their officers rode Dire Beasts for steeds.
 Taking on a sigil warrior would be a huge challenge for Rodregas, or at least he thought it would be.
 He was still unclear of how strong and fast he was.
 His stomach hurt from his wound, but not as badly as it should.
 Clearly, the first step in his duty was to heal up from his wound and relearn how to fight in his new body.
 When he got up, Imeralda was already standing but Doi’van remained kneeling in thought.
 He nodded to Imeralda and she quietly followed him back into the barn.
 About ten minutes later Doi’van joined them and they started to plan how to clean up the barn.

I was pissed off that the cops fucked this up!
 It was the one chance for my firstborn son to avoid prison, and damn-it there had to be another way.
 It was now time for me to intervene.
 To pull out whatever stops needed to be pulled to protect him.
 To save him.
 My boy.
 Brandon.
 I set an appointment with the arresting officers.
 I arrived at the police station with Brandon and we were escorted to an interview room.
 We were sitting in the police station in a county that is known for being tough on drugs and prosecuting everything to the fullest ability of the law.

When you’re a writer, you got one person.
 As close as I am to Lorelei, when I’m in there, when I’m at the typewriter or guitar or keyboard, I’m all alone, man, a chilling kind of alone, and I’m conscienceless, ruthless.
 You write because you’ve got to man, because it’s your guts that are hurting, your guts that are in need of something.
 And you’re gonna find that thing, even as it keeps receding from view, even as the more you go forward the farther away it gets.
 You ever been to the beach man?
 Seen those little clams, tiny little fuckers, that dive as you dig around them.
 They just keep burrowing downward, and the faster you dig the deeper they go (is that a Beatle’s line?
 something like that) (laughs).
 Anyway, those little fuckers defy your best efforts, they’re almost always gonna be quicker than you.
 That’s what writing is, man, it just keeps going farther into the sand, the thing you’re looking for, the thing that’ll make it all alright.

He laughed, hugging her again.
 "There's nothing like a tragedy to draw a family together."
 He smiled at his parents.
 "Are you serious?"
 "Yes."
 He stroked her hair as he gazed down at her.
 "We were all out of our minds with terror and grief.
 None of us could just sit still.
 I kind of oversaw the private investigators that Father hired.
 And we felt better being all together.

 CM:  	The river, back home…

 Another Memphis song.
 Yeah, it’s about growing up next to that river, Big Muddy in my veins, also about being born just a few miles from Niagara Falls, and, briefly it makes mention of the Pacific.

Art – Well, seems that my work here is done then.
 Jim – Off to save the world now?
 Or just have dinner with your new love interest?
 Art – Neither, I’m going to take a nap, the world isn’t worthy of a benefactor of my sort, and I have a date with Karen tomorrow night.
 That sounds good.
 Oh yes before I go, remember what I asked you about helping me with Johnny…
 Jim – I’ve been thinking about what I’m going to try to do.
 Art – That’s good, but I have a new hurdle to throw in.
 Jim – What now?
 Art – We’re adopting Eugene.

Dave Brubeck with Gerry Mulligan.
 Lena Horne.
 Harry Belafonte singing blues.
 Though it might take him months to graduate, he said he was anxious to clean things out, to get prepared, ready to move.
 On the evening of Valentine’s Day, 1963, I stopped by his house and he showed me a sack half full of small candy hearts, with slogans like, “I love you” and “Hey, sweetheart.” He picked out a half dozen that asked, “Why not?” and gave me the rest of the bag, along with instructions for tomorrow at school.
 He said, “Give one to every girl who looks like she didn’t get a valentine.” I passed some around, though not half as many as Eric would have done.
 That was Friday.
 I picked him up from work.
 We stopped at a hamburger drive-thru and at a liquor store where the proprietor had more avarice than scruples.
 On Point Loma, in Fort Rosecrans, Eric’s dad’s grave lies in a clearing with no shrubs or trees nearby to mark the spot yet, even in the dark, Eric walked right to it.

For a few seconds I forgot all about the reasons I didn't like him, and just wished he was sitting in front of me instead of two rows behind me where I couldn't see him.
 Then I realized what his arrival really meant.
 Rachel had stood me up.
 She wasn't on the bus, and she apparently hadn't come with her brother, so she wasn't coming.
 I knew I should reserve judgment until I'd given her a chance to explain what'd happened, but it was hard to remember that when faced with Alec's air of superiority.
 Rachel was nicer, but she was still a Graves.
 Maybe this was just a sign of things to come.
 Apparently I wasn't the only one put off by Alec's snobbishness.
 A couple of guys who looked like they were old enough to be in college were rolling their eyes at him.
 They were whispering and laughing, but positioned as they were closer to Alec than to me, I couldn't make out any of what they were saying.

“You thank it like you would thank anyone else,” A voice said.
 I almost jumped to the moon in surprise.
 Out of nowhere someone, or something, appeared beside Jason.
 I think Jason was more scared because he actually jumped into the air.
 As it came into view, it became obvious that it was a girl.
 She in a yellow cloak and had dazzling red hair.
 She smiled warmly at us with her chocolate brown eyes and I realized she had pointed ears.
 So I basically made the conclusion that she wasn’t human.
 “Uh okay…” I said slowly.
 She giggled, “Wow I never thought I’d scare a bunch of half-lings but I guess I did.” “You didn’t scare me,” Jason said quickly.

The energy suddenly rolling off of the gathered shape shifters nearly drove me to my knees as Alec continued.
 "By their actions Adriana Paige learned of our nature, and it was only by the grace of the Maker that I was able to stop them from killing her.
 Their deaths were an unavoidable price to save an innocent."
 Some of the faces across the circle from me flinched a little, and I had a moment to wonder if Brandon hadn't told them the truth about what'd happened.
 "Her life belonged to me, it was mine to dispose of as I saw fit."
 I opened my mouth to protest, but closed it at a sharp jab in the ribs from Rachel.
 "The ancient laws don't support her life being a disposable commodity, extinguished at your whim.
 Not even the bond of Ja'tell provides you with that right."
 Brandon's grin was wider even than before.
 "Ah, but those aren't the laws under which we labor now, are they?

“Do not lie to me.
 I have watched you two slaughter my brethren.
 I have seen much of your handiwork.” The elf glared at him, ugly hatred skewing his handsome features.
 “By now your brother is dead.
 Three of my best warriors await him around that corner.
 I thought it appropriate you knew this before I took your life.”
 “Do not talk to me of what is appropriate,” Qurrah said.
 “Kill me, if you will, but do not bore me with your chatter.
 I have suffered beyond anything you can do to me.”
 A firestorm of anger overwhelmed the elf’s features.

Viewing the global employment situation as a whole, there are strong grounds for confidence in a brighter future.
 Resurgent Asia: The nations of East Asia, which went through rapid expansion followed by a major financial crisis, are back on the growth path.
 The Japanese economy is once again growing and creating new jobs, both at home and abroad, especially in China, which has become the largest destination for Japanese foreign investment and a key supplier base for Japanese manufactured goods.
 China’s economy continues to expand at more than eight per cent annually and India’s may soon achieve that rate of growth.
 Fuelled by very rapid expansion of automotive, financial services, IT, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications, India has emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in the world, the third largest destination for foreign investment, and a key player in IT and IT-enabled services.
 According to a recent study, by 2040 China and India will be the first and third largest economies in the world.
 Together with Russia and Brazil, they could account for a larger portion of world GDP than today’s six largest industrialized nations.
 Population, which was perceived as a liability not long ago, now appears to be an asset.
 In reality, population, like nuclear energy and so many other things, is neutral.
 Its value depends on what we human beings make of it.

I handed the dark red stone to Chevelle, who only nodded as he took it from me, not examining it before he slipped it into a pocket to hide it away.
 There was a sound at the door and his fingers slid over my lower back, urging me into my room.
 I was closed in just as the main door opened, giving me no more than a glimpse of deep red curls.
 I tried not to be annoyed about being closed in a room.
 I was a prisoner after all.
 Chevelle’s voice was barely audible as he spoke to his visitor in a formal tone.
 “Ruby.” Ruby?
 Before I could stop myself, I was at the door peering through the frame.
 A tiny crack of light allowed me about three-quarters of Chevelle’s back and all of his guest.
 Ruby.

“And good morning, sunshine,” Steed called from atop a large, black stallion.
 The beast’s nostrils flared, breath steaming in the cool morning air.
 Two more of the animals pawed in the distance behind him.
 Steed chirped a whistle and they walked forward, the slim, muscular one moving to stand beside Chevelle as a mammoth crossed in front of me and knelt.
 I drew in a startled breath at the sheer size and nearness of it.
 Steed shot me a mischievous wink.
 “Well?” I was speechless, mouth agape.
 The thing seemed as large and black as a starless night.
 Steed was pleased with my reaction, but Chevelle’s eyes rolled heavenward.
 He didn’t comment, though, simply holding out a hand to help me mount before swinging onto his own.

Chapter 5
 The water war continued with us getting them and them getting us.
 We attacked them with a pool, and they threw water balloons at us while we were on bikes.
 It was pretty simple, but the whole time all I noticed was Seth.
 He wasn’t the same to me anymore; he always had this mask on his face, hiding himself from the rest of us.
 I had to find out what was wrong, and soon.
 “Jazell, are you paying attention?” Emily’s annoyed voice broke my day dreams.
 I snapped back to attention, “Uh yes, I am Emily.
 Just for the record, what are we talking about?” “Jazell you’re hopeless!
 We’re talking about what to do next,” she scowled.

While global IT software and service outsourcing displaces some IT workers, total employment increases as the benefits ripple through the economy.
 The net additional number of jobs in the USA added as a result of outsourcing is projected to exceed 300,000 by 2008.
 They will be generated across all sectors of the economy, most especially in construction, transportation and utilities, education and health services, wholesale trade, and financial services.
 Employment is not a zero sum game.
 Computerization: The exciting growth of ICT-based service exports by no means exhausts the potential contribution of computers to growth of employment opportunities.
 Computerization is not merely a field or sector of commercial activity.
 The computer is an instrument and a catalyst that can stimulate creation of employment and self-employment opportunities in virtually every field – from farming, fishing and textile designing to lean manufacturing, financial services, bio-informatics and genetic engineering.
 While the application of computers has already been extended to all these fields, there has not yet been a systematic effort to assess the employment potential that can be tapped by fully extending and accelerating this movement.
 The recent initiative in India to establish knowledge centres in every Indian village by 2007 is one example of a pioneering effort to harness ICT as a means to catalyze a whole range of on-farm and off-farm rural activities, which will inevitably translate into more and higher productivity and greater employment generation.
 These centres can be utilized to deliver technological expertise to upgrade farm yields, vocational training and education, purchasing and marketing information to raise incomes.

I should have put some lotion on this morning."
 "Go do it now."
 "I'm feeling too lazy."
 "Tell me where it is, and I'll get it for you."
 Following his instructions, she went to his bathroom and got the lotion.
 Opening the bottle, she sniffed it as she descended the stairs.
 It didn't smell as good as the sunscreen, so she wasn't tempted to rub any onto her own skin.
 "Thanks, honey--this'll feel great."
 He rubbed some on his legs and then stripped off his shirt.
 Marie watched in fascination as he applied the lotion to his arms and chest.

On the fourteenth and final day, however, Harruq was in an unusually quiet mood.
 His mind refused to stay on the mock combat, and many times a quick jab of Aurelia’s staff cracked his arm or wrist when he should have easily deflected it away.
 Finally, the elf called it a day.
 She set aside her staff.
 “I thank you for sparring with me,” she told him.
 “It’s nothing,” he said.
 “Better to spar with someone than practice alone.”
 Aurelia smiled.
 “You’re different than what I expected, Harruq.
 Smarter, too.”

The man in black had made no threatening move as the other two charged.
 They were almost upon him when he cast aside his hood to reveal his ever-changing face, his deep red eyes, and his horrible smile.
 His hands lunged forward, the floodgates opened, and all his power came rushing forth.
 A wall of black magic rolled like a tidal wave conjured from his fingertips.
 The elven brothers tumbled through and vanished.
 Felewen leapt back when she saw the attack coming.
 She rolled behind a house and tucked her head.
 The wave continued down the street, straight for Aurelia.
 “I do not fear you,” she hissed through clenched teeth.
 A wall of water swirled about her, flowing from the otherwise dry dirt street.

“You know how we became half-lings?
 You know who attacked us that day?” “I've said too much already,” she said and backed up.
 “I must go.” “Wait!” I called.
 “Wait; tell me what's going on!
 Tell me what we're supposed to do!” But she was already gone.
 *** I opened my eyes and the cold of the morning bit at my cheeks.
 Seth was fast asleep next to me, his blue hair covering half his face.
 Emily was curled up a few feet away from me.
 Jason turned in his sleep, mumbling something unintelligent.
 I needed to talk to someone, but everyone was sleeping.

And about Godzilla being feared, well I was talking to Rusty down the street.
 Jim – Wait, you mean the same Rusty who never leaves his parent’s basement and watches nothing but Japanese cartoons?
 The one who got thrown into the school dumpster every day at lunchtime by the girls chess team?
 Eugene – That’s the Rusty and it’s called Anime.
 Well Rusty was telling me about how it’s illegal to yell ‘Godzilla’ in a Japanese theatre, like how it’s illegal to yell Fire in an American theatre.
 He says that it’s because the Japanese are that afraid of Godzilla.
 And who can blame them after he ruined Tokyo so many times.
 But anyways Rusty said that most older Japanese people will just soil their shorts even at the mention of their old nemesis.
 Not only that, but everyone knows the name Godzilla.
 Godzilla will be perfect!

 The two brothers were almost to the wall when the skulls flew overhead.
 “Make them stop!” cried Harruq Tun, hands pressed against his ears.
 Beside him, Qurrah Tun stood mesmerized by the sight.
 Hundreds of skulls bathed in purple fire sailed over the walls of Veldaren like dark comets.
 Gaping mouths shrieked mindless wails, their voices bone-chilling and unrelenting.
 A few soldiers fired arrows, but most hid behind their shields.
 “Why do you cower?” Qurrah asked, striking his brother on the shoulder.

It made sense, but didn't really help me fill in any of the broad holes that had been bothering me for so long.
 Mallory gave me several seconds to ponder her answer before continuing.
 "How is the rest of the pack?
 Alec will tell me, but he'll filter his answer through what he thinks I'm able to hear, not necessarily what I need to hear."
 "They're worried.
 Jessica and James seem to be the most unsettled by everything that's happened, but I think everyone is more or less concerned.
 Is there someone in particular that you were curious about?"
 Mallory hesitated for a moment, and then nodded.
 "How does Donovan seem to be doing?"
 The question took me completely by surprise.

“We could eat well for weeks.”
 “The king must be desperate for workers,” Qurrah said.
 He raised an eyebrow at his brother.
 “I take it you’re interested?”
 “I’m strong enough for whatever they want from me,” Harruq insisted.
 “We have no need for money.” Qurrah reminded him.
 “We take what we need.
 We always have.”
 “My days are spent in boredom and you know it,” Harruq said.
 “How long will they offer that much coin?”

It has released the initiative and pride of long suppressed peoples to achieve self-sufficiency and determine their own destinies.
 It has finally lifted the suffocating blanket of pessimistic economic determinism that has stifled human hopes and aspirations for nearly 200 years since Thomas Malthus first set forth the thesis that human population will always outrun the growth of food production, thus ensuring the perpetual poverty of humankind.
 The remarkable achievements of countries such as India, which at a time when famine threatened to claim millions of lives launched a massive national programme that increased foodgrain production by three-quarters, and China, which nearly doubled food grain production over the last two decades, are outstanding testaments to the accomplishments of people in many countries.
 Worldwide, production increases in major cereal crops are estimated to have provided enough food for more than a billion people.
 Food has become a symbol of our collective human endeavour to create a better world for all.
 But the victory has been partial and neither the challenge nor the opportunity which food presents have been fully addressed.
 It is of crucial importance not only to the poor, but also to the peace and stability of global society that we complete the task of banishing famine and hunger once and for all.
 Hunger anywhere threatens peace everywhere.
 Hunger leads to political instability, social unrest, massive migrations, rebellions, civil war, crime and violence.
 Prosperity, which eliminates hunger, also tends to eliminate violence.

 The shock of seeing her disappeared at the reminder.
 “Are you here for council?
 To collect me?” My voice was colored with the shame of being a criminal.
 Bird-killer.
 Elf-strangler.
 Surprised, she glanced at Chevelle and then back to me, forcing a smile.
 “Are you all right, Frey?” I stood there baffled, and then remembered screaming.
 I cleared my throat.
 “I was covered in bark.” Her eyebrows turned up as she looked again at Chevelle, who was mirroring her concerned expression.

Fear v. Love
 While speeding on Interstate 5 north out of Sacramento past orchards and pastures, with long miles between the small towns, I think back to my talk with Toni, the part about suffering from panic attacks.
 During five of those hard years, while I taught in Chico, I often drove this highway to visit writer friends in San Francisco.
 This part of I-5 terrified me, with visions of a sudden attack that would deny me control over my mind or body, leaving me helpless and miles from the closest nurse or doctor.
 For no good reason except the fear of fear, my heart would race, my lungs and throat constrict, my hands become slick with sweat.
 I couldn’t run because I couldn’t breathe.
 I couldn't fight, because the enemy was me.
 The first time, a few years before, I landed at County Mental Health in San Diego.
 A doctor prescribed valium, which barely helped.
 For months I lived in abject fear.

But there was no mention of that.
 Rick noticed her glazed eyes.
 "Are you tired?"
 "A little."
 "Found anything helpful?"
 "No.
 Well, maybe.
 A number of scientists--men who called themselves scientists, that is--have built different types of machines, but I don't think you and I could do that.
 They had no really provable success, anyway."
 She shook her head, turning a page.

The fact is, this man was never a father or a dad or anything to me.
 Richard basically knocked my mother up in high school, married her, had another son and abandoned her and his sons while they were still babies.
 He never paid my mother a dime in child support.
 My mother tried to warn me when I decided I wanted to meet him, but as only time would tell, trying to tell your teenage son anything is a virtual impossibility.
 After I graduated high school, I went to Hawaii with a friend to live.
 The simple reason?
 I was eighteen and that was drinking age in Hawaii.
 I quit my grocery job and took the money I had saved and headed off to the islands.
 Once there, we pretty much surfed, drank and looked for pot.
 We were on an extended vacation and my best friend Pete, who went with me, was a spoiled brat with an endless supply of money from his father who was one of the Greek associates of my stepfather, Dino.

So instead of thinking he simply felt the cool stone wall and it slowly, truly, hit him.
 He was alive.
 For some time that simple awareness was enough.
 He was alive, and in a stronger, younger body.
 With the physical essence of the lion now part of his new body, and the magic of the sorcerer Ravenhurr, he would be an extremely talented person.
 That everything had gone so well was simply a god-sent miracle.
 He had rescued the maiden and killed the sorcerer.
 Of course the man's soul and intellect had been destroyed and a lion from the realm of the gods itself had been destroyed.
 It was far from a perfect victory, but Rodregas knew there were never perfect victories.
 He had had more luck in the last half hour than in his entire downtrodden life.

My grandmother was a stark contrast to my grandfather.
 She always had a bright smile and she treated us with an abundance of love.
 She was a heavy woman and her girth made her seem even shorter than she was.
 She had an infectious laugh.
 Grandma worked at a department store named Zodies.
 On occasion, my mother would take us to the store to visit her on her break.
 We would run from aisle to aisle searching for her brightly colored smock.
 One of the few times I ever remember eating out was when we shared her lunch break and ate hot dogs and popcorn at the department store cafeteria.
 I still think of Grandma whenever I walk into a discount store and smell the snack bar.
 We lived with our grandparents longer than we should have, but my mother had little choice.

 Jim – You’re in love?
 Art – Yep.
 Jim – When did that happen?

 Hard to tell for sure, the time sure did fly past.

 I don’t think I’ve felt this young ever.
 Wow.

He isn't here, so possibly they're going down together."
 It'd been a fairly slender thread upon which to hang my hopes.
 Somehow my dream of seeing Les Misérables had morphed into a dream of seeing Les Misérables with Rachel.
 We still didn't get to spend much time together, but she was rapidly becoming the only person I could confide in besides Brandon.
 A boyfriend, or near-boyfriend, was nice, but some things just needed to be shared with another female.
 I couldn't tell my mom about my feelings for Brandon or she'd absolutely freak.
 After spending so much time lying to her about the origin of the almost four dozen roses, I couldn't afford any kind of slip in that regard.
 She'd thought the single rose, Lagrimas del Angel, as I was calling it now, had been sweet and thoughtful, especially when I'd told her it was from an anonymous admirer.
 The other roses had been an entirely different matter.
 I'd had to do some pretty quick talking to convince her I didn't know who they were from either.

The establishment of secure foundations for peace will be aided by development and post-conflict peace building.
 Yet if there is a growing international consensus on the peace operations undertaken by the United Nations, there is no such consensus on its developmental work.
 Indeed, this lack of a consensus reflects a worldwide crisis in the field of development economics.
 As development becomes imperative, as we approach the turn of this century, we are faced with the necessity of giving new meaning to the word.
 Reflecting on development is thus, in my opinion, the most important intellectual challenge of the coming years.
 Already, it seems clear that macro-economic growth can no longer be deemed sufficient for development purposes.
 Countries pursuing macro-economic growth paths have the necessary foundations for development, but that is only the first part.
 There can be no lasting development with the exclusion of social groups from the fruits of growth.
 Nor can there be long-term prospects for development when the environment is pillaged and the rights of future generations ignored.
 Finally, growth which is not accompanied by the improve ment of the social fabric of society will be only a hollow shell.

Rodregas nodded, he agreed but he was not the young man he looked.
 “I do understand that, and I expect nothing from her.”  He smiled and said, “But I do plan to enjoy what we do have for as long as it lasts.” “And when she takes other lovers?” Doi’van asked.
 Rodregas responded with the only answer he had, “I will do my best to handle it and not get jealous,” he said.
 Rodregas knew it would be hard, but he was a hard man and he would have to manage.
 Doi’van nodded, then glanced over to see Imeralda walking over with several of the Grimoires and he added, “I was not angry, in fact, by my people’s standards I was being very easy on you since you are human and can’t handle pain like an Orqui.
 Without pain, you will not reach your potential for quickness and reflexes.
 On the practice field such quickness means fewer bruises.
 On the battle field such reflexes means life and death.” Rodregas nodded, his words held the ring of truth, but he was not looking forward to days of practices and days full of bruises.
 The pattern of their days changed.
 Now after prayer and meditation came first the practice of the Kata, and then the staff and then finally the books.

When he does say something it’s usually so pointless and offensive that any chicks who might have managed to overlook his bizarre hair and lack of physical mass would be so insulted that they would probably try to kill the annoying little bastard.
 Jim – Don’t even compare Batman to Sumo Assassin!
 Batman is a weakling in a stupid costume with some gizmos, without his gizmos he’s just a loser in tights.
 All Sumo Assassin has to protect him from his enemies are, his Sumo Loin Cloth, and his Sumo Fighting Skills.
 They’re all he needs.
 Hell the loincloth isn’t even bullet proof.
 On top of that the Sumo-mobile can outrun the Bat-mobile any day of the week, not to mention the fact that its solar powered so its earth friendly.
 Eugene – And what pray tell were Slim’s other powers?

He could have made love to her.
 Yet he'd stopped.
 But he couldn't regret that decision.
 She'd probably let him make love to her, but she'd be devastated when it was over.
 Her morals were deeply ingrained, and the guilt would eat away at her.
 He loved her far too much to put her through that.
 But they couldn't go on like this.
 He'd always prided himself on his self-control, but living under the same roof with a woman he loved, a woman who begged for his kisses--that was too much.
 But he knew Marie didn't really understand.
 She thought that they could just kiss forever.

The Cathedral served as both fortress and a temple to the Celestial Gods, and its thick walls were a balance of the practical and the artistic.
 Its towering white walls were adorned with statues and engravings.
 Above the ground floor were huge stained glass windows and arches and on the heights were a series of small towers and domes.
 Rodregas had forgotten how striking the building was and all three stood to admire it for a long moment before moving forward into the inner courtyard.
 In front of the Cathedral set a grandly engraved table of gleaming oak which looked to be more suitable for the dining hall of a noble than in the great courtyard.
 The three men behind the table were clearly Knight Captains of the Order; behind them stood young squires eager to be of service at the word of the knights.
 The knighthood was split into two grand divisions; those with minor sigils who were simply Knights of the Order, and Knights’ Captains, who had gained the greater sigils.
 From their ranks was chosen the Grand Master of the Order, the physical and spiritual leader of the Order of the Soaring Heavens.
 Rodregas’ eyes fell on a man who sat in a beautiful carved chair, a match for the table that sat just behind the knights.
 He was tall and graceful with striking dark eyes and features.

The pain in my chest dulled a little.
 Or maybe it was only overwhelmed by a new pressure.
 I crossed to him slowly.
 Junnie was all I’d had since I came here and now she was gone.
 For a hundred years, she’d be gone.
 I wanted nothing more of Fannie.
 Nothing more of any of this.
 I didn’t know what I would do, but by the time I reached Chevelle, I knew what I wanted: to retrieve my mother’s things from the vault.
 I would leave this wretched place behind.
 I made my stance more formal to match his as I said, “I want to learn transfer magic.” His mouth tightened and he turned his head, a half shake.

They would come for me.
 There would be another inquisition.
 What had the Council member told Fannie?
 He must have known I was a witness, why else would he have been there?
 I could still see the anger on her face.
 She would accuse me, I was sure.
 Somehow, Evelyn would make this my fault.
 “Well?” Fannie hissed, leaning over to glare at me.
 I jerked back to reality, no idea what she’d been saying.
 “Where were you during the commotion?” she repeated.

Scanning the text on the page opposite the picture, he found a little information about her.
 She’d gotten married at 23—a year after the picture had been taken.
 And she’d died in 1941.
 So young!
 She’d been only 37.
 Wondering what she’d died of, he turned the page and found more information about her.
 "Jefferson Tranton handpicked Davis Runyon, heir to the Runyon publishing empire, as a husband for his daughter.
 Chandler Runyon had sold the business when his son was 19 years old so that, in actuality, Davis Runyon was heir only to the family fortune and to the power of wealth, not to the power of position.
 Eager for such, he courted both the young woman and her father.
 Tranton and his son had had a falling out when the younger Tranton had begun his own company in 1925, and because he had disinherited his son, Tranton began grooming Runyon to run his company as well as to become his son-in-law.

Meaning we face yet another problem.
 In churches that preach seeking relationship rather than religion, we're told that lacking a relationship with God, we’ll have at best a heck of a time trying to obey.
 And I have seen no reason to doubt that assessment.
 But if the call to relationship implies we should adore, I confess that truth has escaped me until now.
 I mean, we all know it's possible to have a relationship with someone we don't adore.
 But to have a relationship with Jesus and fail to adore him seems all wrong.
 Evil, maybe.
 After all, I adored Eric Curtis.
 A Trip
 I drive a lot, across the desert to visit my kids and grandson in Tucson, and all over the West and sometimes farther on vacations and book promotion tours.

 They wouldn’t believe me if I went in and testified that the sky was blue.
 Johnny – Who’s damned fault is that?

The halls had emptied remarkably fast, especially considering how much gossip there was for the rumor mill.
 It was almost like some primitive survival instinct had kicked in and steered everyone away from ground zero.
 With the two of them so much closer, I could feel their energy beating at Jasmin and me.
 It was all I could do now to remain motionless as they entered what even I knew was striking range of Jasmin.
 "Awfully exposed out here, aren't you, precious?"
 Vincent's voice was a low, unnatural thing, pitched so it was just barely audible for humans.
 Cassie's expression made my stomach tighten up and my gorge rise.
 It wasn't right for a girl to look at another girl like that.
 Like she couldn't wait to watch Vincent do all kinds of terrible things.

“She’s only trying to help, you know.” He spoke with tenderness and I recalled their touch nights ago.
 I made an effort not to be too obvious about my real curiosity.
 “You’ve known her long?” “Forever.” The way he gazed at her when he spoke left no doubt.
 She noticed us watching her.
 “Ready to get back to it, then?” I grimaced, struggling to my feet.
 “Ruby, how long will the effects of the dust last?” “Depends.” It was the same answer she’d given me before.
 I couldn’t decide if I was truly that out of it or if everyone thought it was funny to make me drag answers from them.
 “On?” She laughed.
 “Don’t worry.
 The dreams will get better.” “They will get better or they will go away?” She laughed again.

Brandon and his friends left through one set of cafeteria doors, while Alec and his friends departed through the other.
 Britney looked like she was trying to decide whether to be mad or impressed, but I felt too sick to stick around and try to nudge her in either direction.
 I mumbled something I hoped sounded intelligible and headed towards the bathroom.
 I passed Mr. Simms and another teacher on my way out, but apparently I looked as awful as I felt.
 They just shot me stern looks rather than stopping me to ask what had happened.
 It wasn't until I'd finished dry-heaving and was trying to clean myself back up, that I wondered where they'd been.
 The school building wasn't that big.
 If they'd really been trying to break up the fight, they should have arrived minutes earlier.
 I thought about hiding in the bathroom for a while, but that was exactly the kind of place a girl like Cassie would want to catch me.
 Instead I took a deep breath and walked outside.

One in ten jobs is now replaced in OECD countries every year.
 This makes the strengthening of job placement systems a crucial element in any full employment strategy.
 Lack of access to information about job or training opportunities retards re-employment.
 Sweden operates one of the most extensive and efficient employment services, in close cooperation with business, that is responsible for filling 60 per cent of total job vacancies.
 Improve labour market information systems within and between countries by increasing the accuracy and comparability of data, requiring mandatory reporting by businesses of all sizes, and freely exchanging information between cities, states and countries on successful employment-generating strategies.
 8.Raise minimum standards for education: Higher education increases productivity, raises personal expectations and consumption, and generates additional jobs in education and elsewhere.
 Lack of qualifications, inadequate and out-dated skills commonly characterize the long-term unemployed.
 There is a strong positive correlation between higher education and higher incomes.
 The employment rate for college graduates in the United States is 75 per cent versus 48 per cent for high school drop- outs; at the height of the recent recession, 3.2 per cent of college graduates were unemployed compared with 11.4 per cent of high school drop-outs.
 Only 57 per cent of 18-year-olds in the OECD countries are pursuing formal education.

He nodded without a word and went back to peering through the tube.
 Rodregas had never understood how the stars in the night sky could make the world closer or farther away from the Celestial Realm, where the Gods lived, or how that could affect magic, but he knew the placement of the stars was critical to the success of the ceremony tonight.
 Ravenhurr was an attractive man, like most of the Immortalist Sorcerers.
 After all, if you can pick your body, why would you ever choose an ugly one?
 Rodregas looked over again at the man that he had brought up the stairs.
 With the ability to select your body you would choose someone like that: attractive, talented and a natural athlete.
 Rodregas stood to the side waiting for Ravenhurr’s signal.
 Ravenhurr raised his head up from the tube again and scanned the rooftop making sure all the parts of the ceremony were in place.
 Rodregas had always thought that it was only Ravenhurr’s eyes that gave away the fact that what was inside him was not as attractive as his exterior.
 Ravenhurr’s eyes had an intensity about them, a habit of weighing everyone else and finding them wanting.

I made it all the way to her door before remembering the Jeep hadn't been downstairs.
 Typical.
 The one time I had good news, and she wasn't around.
 I wandered back downstairs, more because it was cooler down there than because I had any real desire to work on homework.
 Once I was down there though, I grimly decided to open up my bag and make some progress before Mom got home.
 I pulled my feet up on the couch, leaned back against the arm and rested my Spanish book on my knees.
 I momentarily wondered if I should make myself quite so comfortable as my eyes closed.
 The doorbell came as an abrupt surprise, waking me from the nap I hadn't intended on taking.
 I'd been in one of the surreal, vivid dreams.
 It was already too distant to remember details, but I had the impression of being on a mountaintop during the day with vision so acute that I'd been able to see the individual motes of dust.

Rodregas expected Van’dret to get his hands up and fend her off, but he seemed to be in shock.
 Imeralda pulled the dagger out and then viscously stuck it back in the sorcerer, her body moved with the stroke, clearly using every ounce of strength she had.
 Still the blade only stuck in a few inches, but Van’dret screamed and fell to the floor and started to drag himself away.
 As soon as the surprisingly high pitch of Van’dret scream sounded, both Doi’van’s and Rodregas’ feet were free.
 Rodregas stumbled for a moment, but was running almost, even as he caught himself.
 Imeralda was stepping forward with the dagger to finish Van’dret, but he caught her arm and said, “Wait.
 Stop, let me.
 He should be as strong as I am.
 Let me and Doi’van get in close.” She hesitated, but nodded and handed her dagger to him.
 Doi’van pounded past the two and picked Van’dret off the ground, by the front of his robes, and gave him a backhanded slap across the face.

Steed let out a whistle as I entered the main room.
 Ruby sat beside him, a warm smile on her face as if we were old friends.
 Chevelle was near a window on the front wall, leaning on one shoulder, his body turned toward me, expression impossible to read.
 “Better?” Ruby asked.
 “Yes, thank you.” I was polite, but it burned a little to thank her after what she’d done.
 Steed smiled, shaking his head from side to side with exaggerated slowness.
 “Some night.” He looked like he was trying to keep a secret.
 Heat crawled up my neck as I remembered climbing into his lap, and then again the second time I’d gotten out of bed.
 Ruby grinned at him conspiratorially.
 “Yes, so educational.” Had I talked in my sleep?

They could no longer cower within them and hope to be spared.
 In the commotion, Qurrah vanished, unseen and uncared for.
 He had spent his whole life disappearing in crowds, and in the dark of night, surrounded by fear and worry, he was just a shadow.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 Qurrah was in no hurry as he left the city behind.
 The grass was soft and tall, and it felt good under his feet after so much sprinting down stone roads.
 Stars filled the sky, and he smiled to them often.
 In the distance, he spotted a small fire, and he knew to whom it belonged.
 “Where is your brother?” Velixar asked as Qurrah approached.

Steed broke in through the trees, gesturing toward the direction he’d come from.
 “They aren’t far.
 Ready and able for a morning adventure.” As he approached, he glanced at me and then Chevelle, still close beside me.
 “We can get an early start.” He lifted a pack from beside the fire and said, “Bluebell?” I stood, following this stranger without question, not missing the irritation on Chevelle’s face.
 He unclasped the pack to roll the blankets out with a flip, smiling and nodding good evening before stepping away from my hastily constructed hut.
 I unlaced my vest and threw it down, kicked off my shoes and fell into the blankets, stretching happily to finally have something like an actual bed.
 The conversation outside quieted and I slipped off to sleep, trying not to think about my capture and coming return to the village.
 “Freya.” A low voice broke into my dreams of gently rolling hills and soft gray stone.
 I peered through slitted eyes to see Chevelle standing outside the entrance, back to me as he watched a dull red horizon.
 I sat up, lacing the vest over the thin material of my blouse, and slid on my shoes to join him.

A man fighting an elf is like a grain of sand blowing against a stone, yet strong winds and fields of sand can reduce the sturdiest of boulders to dust.”
 “What are we to do?” Qurrah asked.
 Velixar looked at him and smiled.
 “Kill the messenger and the guards that accompany him.
 Vaelor will be furious at the death of family, however distant.
 He will have every excuse to war with the elves and we will exploit that war to our purposes.”
 “Will you accompany us?” Qurrah asked.
 Velixar shook his head.
 “Bring me the head of the messenger.
 I will retrieve an elf to deliver it to the king.”

Alec interrupted my thoughts.
 "I'm sorry to have ruined your night.
 I wanted it to be perfect.
 I should have known that wasn't possible.
 Not with everything hanging over our heads."
 It felt funny to smile.
 The gesture belonged with perfect times, not ones in which people other than me were having nervous breakdowns.
 Then again, a bad night with Alec still somehow managed to beat most other good nights.
 "Everything was almost perfect.
 If there was anything less than ideal, it wasn't your fault."

It’s funny.
 Everywhere they went men hit on Kim, no one could help it, and Crafty was so insecure, you know?
 He hated it.
 He hated going out with her.
 Maybe it led to the divorce, I don’t know the details.
 But, Kim we loved.
 Back then.
 It was her father, man.
 He was a cunt.
 And he started manipulating Crafty and then us, through Crafty.

I only caught his eyes for a few seconds before he looked away, but even his normally riveting blue eyes couldn't distract me from my inability to identify the look.
 I was used to people disliking me, ignoring me, or even occasionally liking me, but this was the first time I'd met someone who seemed to be still trying to decide what camp to join long past the time when most kids our age would have either made a decision or just decided I was weird and started ignoring me.
 Britney seemed to be getting suspicious that I wasn't really listening, so I had to make a lot of eye contact over the next few minutes.
 When I finally got a chance to look back up, Alec and his friends weren't at their table.
 Cassie caught my eye before I looked down, but she was definitely glaring.
 Not the typical I-hate-you-and-I'm-going-to-do-everything-I-can-to-smear-your-reputation-and-get-you-in-trouble-because-we're-in-high-school-and-that's-all-I can-really-do type glaring.
 Instead her eyes seemed to warn me never to go out alone at night because if she ever found me somewhere without any witnesses, they were going to have to hospitalize me.
 I felt a chill run through me, and dropped my eyes out of involuntary reflex.
 I probably would've started shaking if someone hadn't grabbed my shoulder and startled some kind of twisted cross between a shriek and a gasp out of me.
 I turned to give whoever it was a piece of my mind, but Brandon's laughing gray eyes made the words tangle up before they made it down to my tongue.

In addition, the current pattern of economic and technological growth is leading to gross social inequity and rising joblessness.
 The rich-poor divide is widening both within and among nations.
 At the same time, the spread of knowledge and information, particularly through the electronic media, has led to an era of rising expectations.
 The economically and socially underprivileged sections of human society are now aware that their future is not a question of fate, but of political and technological choice.
 If they are not given access to the information superhighways and other technological highways to progress, a new form of social and economic apartheid will spread, which will be even more serious in its consequences to the future of human civilization than the skin-colour-based apartheid which has just ended.
 True education is leadership in thought.
 There are periods in human history when the progress of decades can be accomplished in a few years.
 It is the view of the Commission that we have arrived at one of these great, creative moments.
 Can the political leadership of all countries seize this moment and convert it into an opportunity for promoting job-led economic growth, rooted in the principles of ecology and equity?
 Can we make the gender inequity and the coexistence of extreme poverty on the part of a billion children, women, and men, and extreme affluence and unsustainable lifestyles on the part of another billion, an anachronism of the past?

You have seen me before, haven’t you?”
 “You were the necromancer that led the orcs against Veldaren.
 You helped them cross the bone ditch.”
 “Correct,” Velixar said, his smile visible beneath his hood.
 “It was a glorious day.
 Men of the east no longer trust the elves, and the elves hold little love for our beloved King.
 Of course, thousands died, but what is a little sacrifice compared to such gains?”
 “They joined your army, didn’t they, necromancer?” Dieredon asked.
 Velixar laughed.
 “You are wise, elf, and you are strong, but you have sheltered arrogance.”

When girls say they're going to kill each other, they mean it.
 This was something else entirely though.
 Whoever was on the other side of the flimsy metal door I was hiding behind didn't just believe she would kill the other girl, she knew it, like someone who'd killed before.
 As scared as I was, I should have been a gibbering wreck, but strangely enough part of my mind was coldly rational.
 If I walked out right now I might be okay.
 If however they did kill the brunette, they'd come after me too.
 It was possible, it turned out, to be rational but still completely paralyzed by indecision.
 The girl was sobbing now, and my heart felt like it was about to tear itself into pieces.
 The creak of the bathroom door opening should have been a relief.
 I was expecting the tension to evaporate once there were more witnesses.

 well, at least she'd be back home.
 That thought filled her with an astonishing sadness.
 Sadness, not just disappointment over Hollywood—-because she'd miss Rick.
 "Afraid of what?"
 Rick stroked her cheek with his thumb.
 "Hmmm?
 Oh.
 Nothing."

“That is our last name.”
 Harruq nodded.
 “Aurelia showed me.
 T, u, n, she said.
 And then this sword here has our name…‌kind of.”
 Qurrah stared at the name, thinking.
 “He was an elf,” he said.
 “I guess it is possible he was our father, although I feel it more likely a coincidence.
 Our mother was intelligent, at least for an orc, but was she smart enough to leave us clues within our own names?”
 “Well, he’s dead now, so we’ll never know,” Harruq said, tossing the blade onto the floor.

In formulating strategies, it is essential to take fully into account both the stages and steps of the development process.
 At this stage in their development, it is highly unlikely that food-deficit African nations can make rapid progress toward food self-sufficiency without strong government support and investment to improve technology, training, techno-infrastructure and trade.
 Once the rural sector begins to exhibit its own dynamism, as in the majority of developing countries, there is strong justification for a shift in the role of government from that of prime mover, planner and controller of development to that of catalyst and pioneer.
 Government agencies can tap the potentials of agriculture, identifying new commercial opportunities, educating farmers, demonstrating new potentials, assisting in the transfer and dissemination of new technology, and promoting the establishment of effective organizations – preferably privately or co-operatively owned by farmers or at least with their participation – to process, distribute and market what is produced.
 Coping with the environmental problems to preserve the ecological foundations essential for sustainable agriculture is an area in which government has special responsibilities and must play a leading role on an ongoing basis.
 Regulating the diversion of prime farm land for non-farm uses, expansion of irrigation capacity, control of groundwater exploitation, major programmes for reforestation and to prevent or reverse desertification, and regulation of pesticide use can only be effectively planned, monitored and regulated by governments.
 Comprehensive Strategies
 In this and previous chapters, we have tried to present an integrated perspective of the political, economic and technological factors that need to be taken into account in formulating a comprehensive approach to the issues of peace, food and employment.
 In an effort to illustrate the potential efficacy of this approach in a country representing nearly 25 per cent of the world’s poor, ICPF conducted an in-depth country level study in India to evolve a strategy for stimulating massive increases in job growth and food production (see box pp.
 122–24).

"No."
 He raised her knuckles to his lips.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart—I never considered that living here with me might make you uncomfortable."
 "It doesn't.
 I feel as safe with you as I do in my own home.
 I just--it's just that no one else would understand."
 "Well, don't worry about Teri.
 I won't tell her, and she's going to love you."
 They went into the kitchen to fix breakfast.
 Marie glanced at Rick as he poured juice.

“Run west, and don’t look back!” A horrible shriek of pain tore his attention past them to a circle of torches, held by the gathered defenders of the small village.
 He kissed his sword as he approached, horrified by the massacre he saw in the dim light.
 A great half-orc bore down on a strong child of thirteen that Jeremiah knew well.
 Strength in fields and spirit meant little compared to the might of a warrior conducting the dark god’s power.
 Condemnation tore through his rusted sickle, cut his arm from his body, and then hooked around, severing his ankles.
 The boy fell, dying in four pieces.
 Jeremiah knew then he would enter the golden eternity before the dawn.
 Someone swung a torch while another man thrust his short sword.
 The half-orc shattered the sword with a savage swipe while ignoring the torch as it smashed across his leather armor.
 He roared as he chopped that man’s head into pieces.

Her expression of wonder made his old dried up heart smile.
 He was not sure how to feel, like a pleased father giving out mid-winter gifts to children, or like a young lover giving flowers to a new crush.
 Rodregas was unsure which reaction was proper now, and which she would want him to feel.
 Doi’van had watched the whole show with the thoughtful expression that he was starting to believe was his normal face to the world.
 “And do you have a full suit of Night Bronze Plate Mail for me and a magic sword or three as well?” he asked in his careful voice.
 “I am afraid that if we want any proper armor for ourselves we are going to have to take it off some Immortal Guard’s corpse.
 But I do have one other Black Yew bow and a bigger sword that probably makes more sense for you to use than me, since I have used nothing but short swords for a very long time.” Rodregas then pulled out the two-handed great sword that he had found at the keep and handed it to Doi’van.
 On Doi’van it was more a hand and a half sword, but as he flourished it around a bit, Rodregas could see he was pleased.
 “The steel is simple, but the balance is good.
 I am starting to be very happy that I helped pull this wagon up the hill,” he said with a deep chuckle, which sounded like distant thunder.

His eyes bored into mine.
 “Were you scared?
 What’s it feel like there?” “You know when you’re away from home and no matter how great a time you’re having, you’re still a bit uneasy, so when you get home you always feel relieved?
 You unwind, your heart slows.
 Nothing can hurt you now.
 That’s how it felt.” “You’re a lucky guy,” Eric said, in a more wistful tone than I had ever heard him use.
 Freedom
 Driving through Los Angeles, thinking is dangerous.
 An instant of distraction can get you killed.

Now go, we have stuff to do.” My stomach knotted.
 Stuff.
 Chevelle appeared reluctant to get up.
 For a moment, I thought he might reach out to me, but he only stood and left without another word.
 It ached.
 I didn’t want him to hate me.
 Ruby whirled into the room and grabbed me around the waist from behind, spinning me up, over the back of the seat, and through her door before I could process what was happening.
 She plopped me down in the center of her bed and swung around to sit in front of me.
 My head was reeling from the spin as she smiled at me, waving her hands and bringing a plethora of bottles and canisters flying toward us to drop on the bed.
 I thought with disappointment that I hadn’t responded to her attack as Chevelle had taught me and laughed at the image in my head.

Free, intricate, searching are all words that lived in him.
 "I first met him last summer.
 It seems like such a short time but he became so much a part of me there's no telling how many centuries of growing up we both did.
 "I took him everyplace.
 Not because I was so naive as to let him take advantage of the fact that I had a car, but because when he was around I felt something very penetrating in the air, as though the essence of all life was with me.
 "It wasn't just us two.
 There were Eric, Margaret, Lane and me.
 Oh, what a seedy bunch of bums.
 But we were a team, and each one of us, out of loneliness perhaps, found something worth all the riches in the world.
 We found love.

So be on the lookout for Gene, he seems to have been a little preoccupied with whatever he needs to talk with you about.
 Art – He wasn’t in trouble was he?
 Jim – I don’t think so, he didn’t seem to excited, just anxious to talk to you.
 Art – Ah well, I guess I’ll find out soon enough.
 Back to the business at hand, your brother Johnny.
 Jim – What about him?
 Art – Johnny seems to be slipping further away from us.
 Jim – How do you mean?
 He’s never been all that close To anyone in the family.

Yeah, I deserve some money for that.

 BG:  	That’s right.
 I made money—take away my Hippie merit badge, send me to hell.
 I know you’re not implying there’s something insidious about that, that they sold because I was dumbing down or whatever.

 They reached hundreds of thousands of people, man.
 That’s the bottom line.
 Hundreds of thousands of good folks out there thinking about “Burn my Bridges.”

"Mrs. Alexander, I read something about water around reactor cores giving off a blue light.
 Can you explain how that works?"
 I'd expected something stupid, but glowing water made me think of the vivid dreams.
 I listened as intently as I'd ever listened to anything, and did my best to follow all of the diagrams as Mrs. Alexander attempted to break a college-level concept down into something fairly average high-school students could follow.
 "So, in short, really it's a matter of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms attempting to shed the excess energy they've gained from the radioactive particles emitted from the core.
 The energized electrons give off radiation in the visible light spectrum during the process of dropping down to a lower energy state."
 Hmm, an interesting concept, but still not an explanation for how the water in my dream had given off a soft golden glow, one that had rippled with the movement of the water.
 Almost before I'd realized it, my hand shot up.

Something came out of my chest that sounded like a moan.
 I blinked, too slow.
 “Attacked?” “They must have tried to strengthen your bonds.” I knew I should have been shocked but I couldn’t produce the feeling.
 “They succeeded,” I complained.
 He nodded.
 “It seems it may have taken your magic completely this time.” This time.
 I concentrated on keeping my head straight, to look like I was listening properly, acting properly.
 My attempt at concentration must have come across as anxiety.
 “You found a way to break their bonds before.
 You will again.” I nodded.

I can't believe you're taking me to Hollywood.
 I can't believe you're going to Hollywood just for me."
 "I'm going to have as much fun as you are."
 He stroked her hair.
 "I love being with you, Marie.
 And I love seeing your excitement.
 Every time I see you get excited about a microwave or a dishwasher or a blacklight, it makes me want to think of something else I can show you or give you."
 Her heart tightened.
 "Thank you."
 She tilted her head back to look up at him.

"Yeah.
 I want to make you feel like a queen."
 "Oh."
 Smiling, she laid her head on his shoulder, relishing his tight embrace.
 He was every bit as much a dream as Hollywood.
 CHAPTER NINE
 Marie awoke late Sunday morning, pulled the covers over her head, and turned away from the sun.
 She felt as if she could sleep forever.
 An hour or so later she awoke again.

If he could close the gap, the bow would prove no match for his longsword.
 Another arrow struck an inch from his left foot.
 His leg was aflame, yet he continued to charge, pulling back his shield so his sword could lash out.
 But the elf was not close enough, and he was more skilled with a bow than in just firing arrows.
 He snapped the wood up, cracking Antonil across the bottom of his hand, which held firm to his blade.
 Undaunted, the elf stepped closer, ducked underneath the guard captain’s return swing, and then kicked at the arrow still lodged in his shin, finally making Antonil drop his blade.
 The elf stood, drawing an arrow as he did.
 Antonil, now lying on the ground, struggled to bring his shield over his chest.
 Part of it caught beneath his side and would not come.
 He would not be able to block in time.

"I want to go home, but I also want to go to Hollywood."
 He chuckled.
 "Do you want to cut out the walk in the garden until we get back?"
 "I'm afraid--oh."
 It had just now occurred to her that she wouldn't be able to walk in the garden for the whole week they were gone.
 But she just couldn't pass up the chance to go to Hollywood.
 She'd compromise.
 She'd walk today and tomorrow, and if she got back home .

He wasn’t as formal.
 He seemed relaxed, and apparently magic, quick and powerful, was intertwined into his every routine.
 He didn’t need to do much by hand; I would have spent hours trying to build a spit and skin an animal.
 An old question came back to me and I asked, “How do you hunt?” “Hmm?” “You don’t have a bow,” I explained.
 “What do you use to hunt?” He hesitated, as if deciding what to tell me.
 “I use magic, Frey.” He looked like he was waiting for me to be upset.
 “Oh.” I contemplated his answer.
 “I thought maybe you had a knife.” He smirked.
 “Yes, well, that would have been easy enough.” “And Junnie prefers to hunt… for sport?” He had that look again and I wondered why he would be so cautious.
 Because I was dangerous?

“Sit down, Kenneth.” “What’d I do?” “It’s about Eric.” Studying her mournful eyes, I eased myself into the chair.
 “Yeah?” “They crashed.” My heart stopped and I gave up breathing.
 “Eric?” I gasped.
 "El Cajon Valley Hospital.
 They don’t believe he’ll make it.” My brain catapulted through space, into a black hole.
 There I remembered the night my mom checked into the hospital and the doctor said she was probably a goner.
 “He’ll make it,” I said with defiance.
 “He’s Superman.” She nodded.
 “Let's keep hoping.
 Billy and Cliff should be on their way here, I sent a pass for them."

I could see no other way.
 It was days before I spoke to Chevelle again, though he didn’t seem to mind the lack of conversation.
 He simply rode as he always did, with intermittent glances in each direction, as if I weren’t even there.
 In truth, he hadn’t appeared to notice my behavior at all.
 When I finally broke the silence, we were navigating a narrow pass.
 “How long will we be riding?” I wasn’t specific in my question, not wanting to reveal I had no idea where we were headed.
 If he’d been under the false impression he’d had to take me, I wasn’t about to mess that up only to be dragged back to the village.
 Especially after everything that had happened.
 My horse quickened his pace to ride alongside his and I made a mental note to learn how to control the horse on my own.
 The constricted path forced us close together, our stirrups and legs brushing as we rode.

Proven methods are available and have been commercially applied with great success, as the achievements of Israel so dramatically demonstrate, radically to reduce water consumption by as much as five- to ten-fold, while at the same time significantly increasing crop yields.
 The most productive of these methods, involving the construction of greenhouses, is too capital-intensive for immediate wide spread adoption in developing countries.
 Drip and sprinkler irrigation are far more moderate in cost and still result in enormous savings of water.
 The cost of adopting these methods can be further reduced by more widely popularizing them, so as to achieve increasing economies of scale in their manufacture.
 8.Low-input sustainable agriculture.
 While we have argued against pressure on food-deficit developing countries to reduce their comparatively low-level usage of mineral fertilizers and chemical pesticides, empirical studies sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences and the Department of Agriculture in the USA found strong evidence, long resisted by scientists and commercial farmers in the West, that chemical-free farming can be as productive and cost-effective as chemical-based methods.
 Industrial countries that offer subsidies to encourage chemical usage should modify their policies to provide active incentives for the use of chemical-free methods instead.
 During the last ten years, Indonesia has succeeded in bringing down the consumption of chemical pesticides without adversely affecting grain production through the nationwide adoption of integrated pest management systems for food crop protection.
 India has launched a massive national training programme to popularize bio logical methods of pest control, which can reduce the consumption and cost of chemical pesticides by 50 to 75 per cent.
 Public education programmes of this type are needed at the national and international level to disseminate information about chemical-free methods to producers and to educate consumers in developed and developing countries about both the health and environmental benefits of organically grown produce.

“We can’t just leave them out there.” I knew Chevelle’s voice, interlaced between the other comments.
 “She’s not ready… we can’t… too soon.” And a voice I couldn’t place.
 “… another setback…” They seemed to be in disagreement but I couldn’t find the interest to stay with them.
 I faded back into sleep.
 These dreams took me farther.
 My sight was off, not as clear, distorted.
 But as I lingered there, I knew the cause.
 I was seeing from a horse.
 We were outside the stone walls of the fortress finding sparse greens to eat, which bored me even in a dream.
 I encouraged the horse to run and he responded immediately, taking flight down the mountainside.

I gasped as the body fell to the ground and even some of the creatures, around stopped.
 They murmured among each other, “She killed a syphon!
 She killed one of us.” So the awful creatures were called syphons?
 What did they want?
 I made a mental note to tell Emily about this.
 That is, if all of us didn’t die first.
 They screeched in anger and I felt their eyes on me.
 Every single one was full of burning hatred.
 But I ignored the feeling and focused on Seth.
 His eyes locked on mine as he wheezed and he sent me a clear message, Help.

"Adriana, but I don't need any help."
 Albert smiled.
 "I know your card wasn't on the red side, but Mrs. Campbell asked me to stop by and go over a couple of steps you left out on your homework assignment from today.
 Since I just finished with Rachel and was over here already, I thought I'd show you the steps you're missing."
 I nodded my assent as I mentally filed away both his name and the girl's.
 Surprisingly enough, Albert was a good teacher, pointing out the steps I'd been skipping over, and even explaining why they were important.
 It was rare enough to find a school teacher who could really teach math these days, finding a student who could teach was nearly a miracle.
 Rachel packed up her things while I was being instructed in the finer points of inequalities.
 As she slid the last book into her backpack, Albert stepped away from my desk with another smile.
 I flipped over to the next chapter and started in on functions as Rachel exited out a corner door I hadn't noticed before.

 "I have no idea."

 "Maybe.

 "We'll get one of the next size too."
 "May I help you?"

Once through both the huge gates, Rodregas, Doi’van and Imeralda came into full view of the Great Cathedral of the Heavens.
 The Cathedral served as both fortress and a temple to the Celestial Gods, and its thick walls were a balance of the practical and the artistic.
 Its towering white walls were adorned with statues and engravings.
 Above the ground floor were huge stained glass windows and arches and on the heights were a series of small towers and domes.
 Rodregas had forgotten how striking the building was and all three stood to admire it for a long moment before moving forward into the inner courtyard.
 In front of the Cathedral set a grandly engraved table of gleaming oak which looked to be more suitable for the dining hall of a noble than in the great courtyard.
 The three men behind the table were clearly Knight Captains of the Order; behind them stood young squires eager to be of service at the word of the knights.
 The knighthood was split into two grand divisions; those with minor sigils who were simply Knights of the Order, and Knights’ Captains, who had gained the greater sigils.
 From their ranks was chosen the Grand Master of the Order, the physical and spiritual leader of the Order of the Soaring Heavens.
 Rodregas’ eyes fell on a man who sat in a beautiful carved chair, a match for the table that sat just behind the knights.

I felt my knees stop working as I took in Brandon's lazy, confident smile, and Vincent's sick, eager expression, but the gentle pressure of Alec's grasp on my hand kept me from falling down.
 I looked up at Alec, hoping for a reassuring smile, but his face had taken on the expressionless mask he used to guard his thoughts.
 I tried to slow down, but Alec kept moving forward, never altering his speed in the slightest as he pulled me directly towards Vincent.
 It seemed incredible that the few other people still in the hall couldn't feel the surge of energy as Vincent stepped directly in front of us and placed his hand on Alec's chest.
 The sudden spike was enough to make my hair stand on end, but Jim Hansen hurried by without any indication there was something out of the ordinary.
 "You're in our way, half-breed."
 I felt Alec's grasp tighten slightly, but considering the crushing strength he was capable of, it was the closest thing imaginable to a non-response.
 Brandon was coming up behind Vincent, as Alec reached up and placed his own hand on Vincent's chest, with another, stronger flash of power.
 The ripple of skin and bone was so quick for a second I couldn't believe what I was seeing, but there it was.
 Alec's hand and fingers had elongated, turning into a hairless replica of the deadly claw that'd terrified me just a few days before.

Unless he got drafted.
 The way he talked was eerie and distressing, as if he meant to leave tomorrow and probably never come home.
 On his more effusive evenings, he might offer advice and wrest promises out of me.
 He asked for a promise that I would go straight to college, because a guy as smart as me simply ought to, and it would please my mom, who could use some cheering after her sorrows.
 He had witnessed how any talk of college made her glow.
 Besides, he didn’t want to see me get drafted.
 “You’d have a hell of a time in the service,” he said.
 “A teacher barks at you, it’s all you can do not to punch the guy.
 Think of what’d happen with a drill sergeant.
 You’d spend all your time locked up.” Twice he made me promise to watch over Billy, to be like a big brother, since Billy wouldn’t have him anymore.

 She’s not an old girlfriend or anything, but—“ “But things can be complicated.
 I understand.
 Give me a call sometime if you like.” “I will.

 But he hadn’t given her a thought since Marie had walked into his life.

Brandon was too good to be true.
 I pretty much expected any day now he'd come to his senses and realize he could do a lot better.
 Right or not, it's hard to really become emotionally invested when you feel like that.
 Rachel on the other hand should have been the perfect friend, but I got the feeling she'd always choose her brother over me.
 I felt guilty for holding that against her, family should be important.
 Cindi's friends back in Minnesota had probably felt similarly, but I'd always been really careful not to make her choose between me and them.
 Alec seemed like the type who'd force a decision just because he could.
 I felt my heart go crazy at the same time tears started gathering at the corner of my eyes.
 It was stupid to have risked a panic attack when I was already borderline depressed, but that was what I was looking at now.
 I'd picked a seat that wasn't visible from the doorway, so I just put my head down and let the twin traumas run their course.

You, for instance, you ought to jump at the chance to go to Pepperdine.” Though I only remember my mom going to church for funerals, or as far as the front door to pick up a free copy of the Christian Science Monitor, her preference for my education was Pepperdine, a Christian college.
 I suppose she hoped I might find guidance there.
 “In L.A., Ken.
 You could learn to write movies, and still get home in a couple hours if your mom needs you.
 But you don’t want to go.” “State College is almost free.
 I’m not going to let my mom pay for some expensive place.
 She’d have to keep teaching those screwy eight-graders forever.
 Besides, we were talking about you.” “What about me?” “Weren’t you going to say what you guess the real big change will be?” He brushed the sand off his hands.
 “I don’t know.
 Maybe something great and happy.” He looked up and attempted a grin.

She had mentioned fairies’ stories.
 I wondered if this was fiction, a fairy ruse, given to Chevelle by Ruby.
 Or maybe the dust was still playing havoc on me.
 I glanced over my shoulder at Ruby where she watched anxiously out the front window.
 I shook my head, finding the line again…
 But I couldn’t deny it.
 Their size was about that of an elf, but all were different.
 The men were thicker.
 Not necessarily with muscle, some more bulbous.
 The women were varied as well, some thin and wiry, some stout like the males.

Velixar beamed at his two disciples.
 At his feet lay the wrapped corpse of Ahrqur.
 “Tun’del was a skilled swordmaster.
 You both have proven yourselves as strong as I believed.
 Unwrap the body.
 It is time we begin.”
 Much preparation later, Qurrah and Velixar stood on opposite sides of a naked Ahrqur.
 The elf lay on his back.
 Thin scars and symbols decorated his body, including a slanted Y across his forehead.
 Thirteen stones surrounded the corpse, each dabbed with a bit of Qurrah’s blood.

A tandem wolf howl sounded in the distance.
 My stomach swam in unease.
 Chapter Thirteen Diary
 The councilman’s body was disposed of, and the group bustled around the clearing.
 I slid my sword into its sheath, careful not to touch the blade.
 I hadn’t comprehended what the flourish of activity meant until Ruby grabbed my arm to conduct me.
 “Come on, we have to pack.” She dragged me along as she rushed back to her house.
 She threw things around her room, sorting and gathering.
 I didn’t really have anything to assemble.
 There was only the pack I’d acquired months ago, nothing in it but that stupid white dress and the pouch… The pouch.

Rodregas had his stuff all spread out in the room he had been using, organizing what would go where.
 The trunk had been left in the barn back at the farm, but its contents were now in his saddlebag.
 Rodregas had signaled Jordaan to wait a moment as he rolled his gear up.
 He was wrapping some of the Grimoires that they were not reading and the small mechanical toy frog that he had picked up in Ravenhurr’s laboratory when Jordaan made a funny sound and stepped forward.
 Jordaan seemed to be staring at the package and Rodregas wondered if he had recognized one of the Grimoires.
 Jordaan pointed at the newly wrapped package and said, “Excuse me, but can I see that?” Rodregas nodded and curiously handled the half wrapped pack over to the Nymph wondering what had captured his attention.
 The Nymph slowly laid the package on the bed and unwrapped it.
 His hand passed over the contents in a motion similar to what he had done while working on Rodregas.
 To Rodregas’ surprise he stopped at the small toy frog.
 Jordaan glanced over to him as if asking for permission and Rodregas nodded his ok. Jordaan reached down and carefully picked up the small frog and cupped it in his hands.

“I didn’t succeed in cheering you up, did I?” She returned the squeeze.
 “There’s really nothing you can do.
 I’m just so discouraged.
 I tried so hard this morning.
 I don’t know what else I can do.” He was quiet for a moment.
 “Did you ever walk in your garden before that morning you walked into my garden?” “Of course.
 I love to walk in the garden.” “So that one morning, there was just a-a door or something.
 All the other mornings there wasn’t.
 So just because you tried hard this morning, that doesn’t mean that trying hard tomorrow or the next day or the next won’t work.” She smiled.
 “That’s true.” “So you’ll keep trying.” “Yes.” “Now I’m sad.”  He met her eyes and then looked away.

Yeah, what the hell?
 Why aren’t we allowed to adopt him?
 Johnny – Well Eugene’s father’s attorney found some obscure law that said that Gene could never be adopted by anyone while the father was still alive.
 Jim – That’s it?
 Johnny – Yep, the judge ruled in favor of Gene’s father.
 As long as he’s alive Gene needs his permission to be adopted by anyone.
 Gene’s father wouldn’t ever let that happen because Gene would be happy.
 The bastard is a total sadist.
 Jim – What if Gene’s mother gave us permission.
 Johnny – Wouldn’t work.

Anyone who would be so controlling to someone like Rachel had already piled up all kinds of bad karma.
 "Fair enough.
 What's your favorite book that you've never read?"
 The question seemed to take her by surprise.
 "Um, Gone With the Wind.
 Probably because she doesn't necessarily start out as a bad person, but allows self-interest and events to carry her into terrible actions."
 I felt my eyes go wide.
 "That's a pretty detailed analysis of a book you've never read."
 Rachel blushed a little.
 "I really haven't read it.

We flew still farther as I watched the mountain pass below.
 There was a scrubby patch of trees ahead and I could see movement there, inside.
 I tried to focus on it… familiar silver and white.
 Commotion brought me back and I sat up, startled.
 My head spun.
 Ruby caught my arm to steady me.
 Her smile was strained as she handed me a drink of water.
 Chevelle was near the entrance of the stone room with Anvil and Grey.
 They appeared to be preparing to leave.
 “What’s going on?” I asked.

She could probably have made a run for royalty if she hadn't topped the dress off with a scowl.
 She didn't look happy to be on Vincent's arm instead of pressed up against Brandon.
 Jasmin elbowed me in the ribs, distracting me before I could start in on whomever it was that happened to be following along behind Cassie.
 "Just ignore them.
 Even Brandon won't try anything with this many witnesses around.
 It's just more dominance games."
 I nodded.
 It made sense, but it was all I could do to keep my eyes grounded despite the cold prickles running up and down my spine.
 Actual conversation was just too much, so I sat quietly with my head slightly bowed while the song ran its course.
 Alec's fingers gently pulled my chin up as the music ended.

“Enough for today,” he said, nodding as he turned, his long strides taking him too quick from my view.
 I sat motionless as I watched him go, and remained so for some time after.
 I hadn’t realized how exhausted I’d been.
 When I finally rose to leave, I stashed a few more of the northern clan documents from the table under my shirt.
 My head was swirling with all that had happened, not simply my new tutor but the magic.
 On my way out I walked past the shelf that hid the body of the now-dead bird.
 I’d never been able to move objects, but it seemed I had done it without thinking.
 And it wasn’t just that, but the thistle.
 I needed to see Junnie.
 The door was partially open when I reached Junnie’s house, so I peeked my head in and called for her.

Karen – Your wife took you to that?
 She must be adventurous.
 Is she here?
 I’d like to meet a woman like that, she must be very interesting.
 Art – Sorry, she isn’t here.
 Last I heard, she was on her way to a convent in Switzerland.
 At least that is what she said in the letter.
 Karen – Oh my god…
 Art – That was right after she told myself and our two sons that we were evil sinners and that we were going to hell.
 That and she hated us for tainting her so.

Harruq clutched them tight, and the look on his face was clear.
 He would fight, and die, before he gave them up.
 The lead guard, already having their coin as well as the bonus of having found elves in hiding, was willing to let it slide.
 “You draw them, even fiddle with them in their sheaths, you die, that clear?” he told the half-orc.
 Harruq nodded, again saying nothing.
 “Calm yourself,” Qurrah whispered to his brother as the two marched in front of the guards toward the main streets.
 “Trying,” Harruq whispered back.
 They marched at sword point.
 Onlookers cackled as they passed, figuring the two were thieves or vagrants caught brawling.
 Their orcish features lent them no kindness, and a few children even threw rocks until the guards shooed them away.

Tennessee planted that seed, man.
 I mean, I loved the guy, but I saw where he was, where he’d always been, how he’d been treated like a second class citizen his whole life—I mean, we couldn’t even go into some restaurants together, still, at that late date.
 And, metaphorically, I started packing my bags.
 CM: 	Yet you stayed in school, didn’t you?
 BG:  	Yeah.
 Well, sort of.
 I mean, I went.

 CM:  	And you graduated.

The outcome of all great social transformations – of which the present instance ranks in magnitude and importance with that of the French Revolution and the movement which freed India and so many other former colonies from imperialism, economic exploitation and cultural domination – depends on the degree to which individuals and institutions within the society have been prepared to understand, accept and respond to the new environment ushered in by the transition.
 Two hundred years ago the people of France were ready to overthrow the old order but ill-prepared to create anything new, with the result that the old soon re-established itself and lived on for another century.
 It took India’s leaders more than four decades to prepare their people for freedom and it has taken another four to overcome the vestiges of colonial rule that prevented the country from releasing its energies for prosperity.
 Long after the foreign conquerors had left, colonialism lived on in the institutions of government and in the attitudes of the population.
 Decades of freedom and education were needed for the country to outgrow a sense of inferiority, a seeking for security, a feeling of submissiveness and complacency, and to acquire a sense of pride, ambition, high aspirations and expectations, a seeking for achievement, and a spirit of adventure and enterprise – and still the task is not complete.
 Development is like a chemical reaction that is determined by the variety and quantity of elements present and the conditions under which they are put together.
 If one essential element or condition is missing, a social transition like a chemical reaction may not take place at all.
 The absence of peace in war-torn Africa or democratic freedoms in former colonial nations, the absence of social stability or an entrepreneurial class, the absence of a functioning banking or educational system, the absence of the minimum necessary infrastructure for transportation and communication – any one of these may be enough to prevent transition until the deficit is made up.
 If even an inessential element or condition is missing, the process of transition may take much longer than would otherwise be necessary.
 Lack of information, lack of education, lack of necessary skills, lack of supportive laws or incentives or protection against losses – insufficiency in any of these areas may be enough to slow or delay the process of change by years or even decades.

"I forgot my key."
 He retrieved it from the dresser and handed it to her.
 He kissed her lips lightly.
 "Goodnight, sweetheart."
 "Goodnight."
 She went back to her own room, wishing that she could sleep next to him all night.
 They drove down to Tijuana the next day, and Marie was delighted with all the shops and stalls and stands.
 People would wave things under her nose, and it was hard to say no.
 But Rick had told her just to walk away unless it was something she really wanted.
 So she'd grab onto his arm and let him lead her away.

How many might fear him if he had skill to match his strength and steel to match his anger?
 “I know of a way,” Qurrah said, pulling at one of many loose strands of his robes.
 “A way for you to practice.
 You saw what I did with that dead body.”
 Harruq nodded, disturbed by the hungry look in Qurrah’s eyes.
 “I did,” he said, “and it scared the abyss out of me.”
 Qurrah dismissed this with a wave of his hand.
 “With exposure comes understanding.
 I am always in control, so don’t fear what I do.
 But I must learn, Harruq.

Vincent was moving too slowly for my human eyes to detect any change, but I was sure he was closer now than the last time I'd looked.
 The feeling of insects marching across my skin intensified as James started shaking.
 Jasmin and Dominic both followed suit within seconds, and the feeling doubled as several of Brandon's wolves went into near convulsions.
 "I said break it up!"
 Mr. Paterson shoved his way past a pair of Brandon's wolves, and for a split second I thought they were going to turn and kill him.
 A heartbeat before they moved a low, barely perceptible growl washed over the entire scene.
 I realized that the sound was coming from Alec, spreading out from him in ripples of calm.
 As the noise touched the shaking wolves in either pack, they calmed down, saving Mr. Paterson from injury he'd never even seen coming.
 "This ends now.
 I don't care who started what, you guys are done dancing.

I verified that the top sheet had her signature on it, and then turned to go.
 She didn't let me get very far.
 "From your bewildered expression during class it appears you aren't transferring in from another school.
 I expect most of your other teachers are just letting you pick up from where they are now.
 I'm afraid this class builds on itself, so I'll be testing you on everything we've covered in the past month.
 I'm sure you've got a full class load, but we haven't gotten into anything truly difficult yet.
 The sooner we get you caught up, the better off you'll be.
 Shall we say a month from today?"
 The prospect of trying to catch up, all the while needing to master new material and deal with a full schedule of other classes, was too much.
 I felt tears rising to the surface even as my heartbeat sped up to near-panic attack levels.

Soon Lisa and I couldn’t ignore Brandon’s behavior.
 Hoping it would just go away or that he would grow out of it like I did didn’t seem likely.
 His grades were terrible, and he kept getting in trouble for being in the wrong place at the wrong time or with the wrong person.
 For instance, he was put on probation for being in a car with someone who was in possession of a replica firearm.
 He looked like total shit, and when we confronted him about it he was feeling bad enough that he confessed: He was addicted to the pain pill known as Oxy.
 He told us that he needed our help to get off of it.
 We never thought to find the reasoning behind the drug abuse, we just thought he had tried it and grew to feel dependent on it.
 He was always a tough kid to raise and he was often a handful and we felt this problem could be handled like any other.
 But we were novices when it came to helping someone kick drug addiction.
 We did our best to assist him and we attempted to detox him at home.

“Watcher.” My skin flushed hot when the word came out harsh.
 Regardless of how he’d treated me, Chevelle was still a member of Council.
 He spun on me, but I could not place the expression on his face.
 Panicked, I tried to recover.
 “You’re my watcher.” It still sounded angry, so I added, “Why?” He hesitated.
 “Frey…” His voice was gentle and he seemed to be searching for a way to answer.
 He must have decided I had no right to anger, because his face turned hard, his tone formal.
 “The council was concerned after you tried to choke Evelyn of Rothegarr.” I drew a sharp breath.
 “What are you talking about?” It caught me off guard; I was more than offended.
 Does he really think I choked Evelyn?

 Didja make a pass at one of their sisters?
 Like…
 Eugene – No, I didn’t do anything.
 Jim – Didja use the wrong gang hand-signs again?
 Like that time when you told those kids that you were a member of the northern-southeastern-side bloody gangsta hood lords…
 Eugene – I didn’t use and hand signs.

I felt his hand on my back and closed my eyes, relaxing into the comfortable, familiar feel of it.
 He pushed me with full force.
 I flew off the cliff, falling straight down.
 I stared back at him as he stood, watching me fall, nothing but open sky above and below.
 I couldn’t imagine why he’d throw me from the cliff, couldn’t think of the magic to stop myself, couldn’t see when I would crash into the base, the rocks below.
 My arms flailed as I jerked awake.
 The group stared at me.
 “Frey?” Ruby asked.
 I grappled for breath.
 “Just a dream.” A few chuckles moved through the crowd.

“When you fall, the enchantment upon your forehead shall burn your body to ash.
 Then your soul may find peace.”
 “I shall do as you command,” Ahrqur said in a lifeless voice.
 “Of course,” Velixar said.
 “There is no other way.”
 Ahrqur glanced to Qurrah, and his mouth opened to speak.
 Both Tun brothers felt a bit of panic, wondering what their new master might say if he learned what they had done.
 Instead, he closed his mouth and glared at Velixar one last time before running north on legs that would never tire.
 “When will you know of his success or failure?” Qurrah asked once his eyes could no longer perceive the elf’s faint outline.
 “Immediately,” Velixar whispered.

She said he had already given her pain pills, which was all he could do.
 Then I came home from school and found her lying in a heap beside her bed.
 Breathing in shallow puffs, eyes open and watery.
 Above the right eye was a long gash, already scabbed over.
 I suspected a prowler had clubbed her and swiped her few items of jewelry.
 But she managed a goofy smile and mumbled that she must’ve fallen, and getting up had seemed too hard to bother with.
 An ambulance carted her away.
 At the hospital, a nurse tapped her spine.
 The lab found meningitis.
 The only doctor who would talk to me gave her lousy odds.

It was the one sure way she’d know it was me.
 A wisp of bright blonde hair swirled around Junnie’s shining eyes as the door swung open, and I decided I must have caught her working; she looked flustered.
 Junnie was older than I, but remained striking with the blonde hair, blue eyes, and thin features that seemed to be standard-issue among the village elves.
 The Council had assigned her as my tutor, citing my advanced age as the reason I couldn’t learn with the others, but I suspected it was my stunning lack of ability that had landed me here.
 Junnie brushed a lock of hair aside.
 “There you are, my Fredora!” She was always trying out new nicknames for me.
 It was no secret I despised my given name: Elfreda Georgiana Suzetta Glaforia.
 I decided, not for the first time, my father must have been a drunken imp.
 Not that I could remember him, but I could definitely blame him because the father was always responsible for naming the firstborn.
 It wasn’t as if you could get more unoriginal than using the ancient word meaning “elf”, but he certainly hadn’t needed to follow it with a string of ridiculous, flowery—I stopped mid-thought, realizing my tutor was watching me.

I had been walking when the pain struck—pacing my room with worry, if I were truthful.
 It hit suddenly, a stabbing, ripping, horrible thing.
 My screams called everyone to order, but then it subsided.
 However, it was only long enough to catch my breath and then it was back tenfold.
 I writhed in agony.
 Nothing they did would help.
 I could not control my magic; it shattered most of the things on the nearby table and twice caught the bedding afire.
 The elders were frantic, which only frightened me more.
 I had never seen them agitated.
 This carried on for hours.

She loves the kids, so she’s always developing some new method, like creating a bi-weekly newspaper and having them write columns on their favorite subjects or assigning them to design their dream house and using the assignment to teach basic geometry.
 In summer, at the Boy’s and Girl’s Club, she teaches art to teenagers, most of them troubled or in trouble.
 Darcy’s great because her giant’s heart is open and she uses her brains and imagination in generous ways.
 And Cody’s one of those most-rare people who have all the tools.
 He’s strong, smart, industrious, and even handsomer than his dad.
 He’ll graduate with a B.A.
 next year with near-perfect grades and two minors, in Latin and Spanish.
 Still, his greatness, the character trait that makes me hope someday we’ll find a President like him, is his devotion to do whatever is good and right, though it might be the hardest way.
 A question.
 How, given the world’s need for such people and his belief that his young wife’s gifts will make her a mother able to lavish her child with love and wisdom, could a man who, when a novice parent, helped create and develop two such excellent beings as Darcy and Cody decline to make and help raise one more.

When we were naked—she was like some preternatural creature, her body’s every curve fit me like a new skin.
 When she pressed her breasts against me I was gone, man.
 And I had this erection, it was beyond human somehow, hard as anthracite—you could hang your coat on it (laughs) and she worked her hand around me like a necromancer casting a spell.
 Just her fingers over me were like cool water.
 Jesus.
 I can’t.
 Let’s just say, that after the preliminaries, which took hours, days maybe, she sat on me, and I entered her, and she was hot like sulfur, like a volcano.
 Tophet.
 Her cunt was hot, and I fell so deeply into her that I haven’t come out yet.
 Can you dig that?

As I went to bed that night, my mind would not shut off and the events of that evening replayed in my head over and over again.
 I lay awake for hours wondering what would have happened if the dealer hadn’t run into the cops.
 They both confessed to the drug deal when separately interrogated.
 The officer said they had less than half of the money, which she had attempted to hide in a trash can in the Starbucks’ bathroom, and Steve had a gun, which Ashley admitted they would have used if I didn’t give them the drugs once I discovered they were short on cash.
 They were going to rob me at gunpoint!
 I had literally dodged a bullet.
 Part II: After the Bust Chapter 21: When You Least Expect It The next morning I woke up before my wife and son.
 After I brewed my morning coffee, I walked down the hall and back into my bedroom where I kept the drug test in my closet.
 I walked into Brandon’s room and told him to wake up and urinate in the test cup.
 It was still early and he begged me to let him sleep a little longer, saying he hadn’t slept well.

Took me a while to recognize it the first time, but now that I know how it feels, well there’s no mistaking.
 This is great.
 You outta try it sometime Jim, it’s great.
 Jim – You know you sound like an older kid trying to get a younger one to try some new drug.
 Art – Do I really?
 Jim – Yep
 Art – Well…Don’t do drugs.
 But try being in love anyhow, it’s just great.
 It’s even better than playing video games.
 Jim- Better than video games?

Later, I watched the evening news and saw reporters standing outside Thomas’s house announcing a record cocaine bust.
 Thomas was sentenced to several years in a federal penitentiary in Texas.
 He would have spent far more time if he hadn’t set up his dealer, who was an even bigger fish in the drug world.
 One of the hardest things I have ever done is accompany my mother to Texas to visit her son, my brother Thomas, in prison.
 Over the years I have seen her strive to survive situations no person should ever be subjected to, but this visit crushed her.
 The plane ride there was difficult and we spoke very little.
 The town was a dump of cheap motels and crappy food joints tailored towards the needs of those who visited convicted criminals in this maximum-security prison.
 Walking her through the doors as they searched us both was humiliating.
 I couldn’t take my eyes off of my mother as the event itself seemed to drain the life out of her.
 We visited Thomas just the one day and although he physically looked fine, he was an inmate in a sea of prison issue clothing surrounded by armed guards behind tall razor wire fences.

Yes, he did know.
 Over the past few months, he had killed seven men and carried their bodies to his brother.
 “I still have at least a week,” Harruq said.
 “Give me until then, alright?
 We could use the money.”
 “I have saved much of what you earned,” Qurrah said.
 “We will be able to eat, not well, but enough to live.”
 “If you say so,” Harruq said.
 “Good luck with your, uh, studies.
 I have a wall to finish building.”

I even got another two as I hobbled back from the office with my roses, which had decreased during their stay there by exactly the number of office ladies.
 I'd politely declined each invitation, citing my need to catch up in Biology and Spanish, and made it to tutoring without further mishap.
 Another usher, this one thankfully no more fawning than the first, pointed me towards my seat, and I felt my second surge of disappointment for the night.
 My seat was on the main level, but it was only three rows from the very top, and all the way off to one side.
 I guess it really wasn't that surprising.
 If the school was paying for the tickets I should just be glad I hadn't been stuck with a standing room only spot.
 Still, as disappointing as it was that the performers were only barely going to be visible, it wasn't as bad as the nagging worry that Rachel wasn't coming after all.
 We'd spent almost every second together talking about how much fun we were going to have seeing Les Misérables together.
 She'd even still been excited about the bus ride.
 Given everything she'd said, I'd anxiously waited for her to show up at the departure point.

Computerization: The exciting growth of ICT-based service exports by no means exhausts the potential contribution of computers to growth of employment opportunities.
 Computerization is not merely a field or sector of commercial activity.
 The computer is an instrument and a catalyst that can stimulate creation of employment and self-employment opportunities in virtually every field – from farming, fishing and textile designing to lean manufacturing, financial services, bio-informatics and genetic engineering.
 While the application of computers has already been extended to all these fields, there has not yet been a systematic effort to assess the employment potential that can be tapped by fully extending and accelerating this movement.
 The recent initiative in India to establish knowledge centres in every Indian village by 2007 is one example of a pioneering effort to harness ICT as a means to catalyze a whole range of on-farm and off-farm rural activities, which will inevitably translate into more and higher productivity and greater employment generation.
 These centres can be utilized to deliver technological expertise to upgrade farm yields, vocational training and education, purchasing and marketing information to raise incomes.
 The experience of India also shows that bridging the digital divide helps to bridge the gender divide in the area of knowledge and skill-intensive work.
 As the construction of rural roads acts as a stimulus to agricultural development of isolated communities by connecting them with sources of inputs and markets in the outer world, ICT can be a catalyst for stimulating the entire gamut of economic activities in rural communities throughout the developing world.
 At the other end of the spectrum, ICT is opening up unparalleled opportunities for self-employment and new business creation for the educated.
 Today more than 50 per cent of American workers utilize computers in their work.

No.
 You can't do that."
 I tried to grab a hold of his arm, but he'd already taken several steps away.
 The pleasant tingly feeling was gone, but that loss was nothing against the sense of cold abandonment rushing through me.
 I tried to step forward, tried to follow him, but my vision was dimming and my heart felt like it was about to explode.
 I managed a single step before my knees collapsed and the ground jumped up to meet me.
 Consciousness was slow returning.
 When my eyes finally fluttered open, I was surprised to find myself in Alec's arms once again.
 "Are you okay?"
 He tried to set me down, to stand me up on my feet, but I grabbed onto him as tightly as my shaking arms were able.

 CHAPTER 1 ENDINGS
 “Move along, move along,” Rodregas said.
 He prodded the prisoner up the roughly hewn stone steps none too gently with the butt end of the lit torch in his hand.
 "We don’t have all night."
 The rough handling of the prisoner seemed like a brash act for a man of sixty years, since the young man could have broken him in half with ease if he chose to do so.
 He was powerfully built, and towered head and shoulders over Rodregas.
 In fact the man looked rather like the hero from a bard's tale, with his square jaw and short black curls and fine dark eyes.

That was more than some people spent on their first car.
 "Rachel, you've already bought me way too much.
 I can't let you get this.
 Not only will I never wear it, you could practically feed small countries with what you'd have to pay for all this."
 She started to pout, but I'd already been taken by that tactic once today, and caving in had just landed me in deeper trouble.
 "I'm serious, Rachel; we are not walking out of the store with this dress.
 You can throw a temper tantrum if you want, but I'm not giving in."
 Rachel glared at me for several seconds, and then suddenly smiled.
 "Okay, Adri.
 I mean I was just trying to do something nice for you, but if you're going to be like that, we'll leave it here."

Great, now what do I do?
 That was a fail, I scolded myself.
 A FAIL!
 “Nice try,” Seth whispered and I think he really meant it.
 Or maybe he was teasing me.
 It’s hard to tell in these situations.
 Seth brandished his sword.
 “My turn.” “Really, warrior?” Kojas said and laughed.
 His laugh was like a bunch of spiders running down my back.
 “You think your sword will do any more than the pathetic archer girl’s arrow?” “Hey,” I shouted, “I’m not a pathetic archer girl!” Oh course, the two ignored me.

I was a little dense—this was, oh, I don’t know, before Lorelei, before we really hit big.
 And, then afterwards, one of those driving home epiphanies, I figured out who she was, and that she was looking at me because she recognized me and expected me to recognize her.
 So, I was a bit embarrassed and when I got home, I called her.
 I said, hey, it’s Buddy.
 I know, she said.
 I said, well, shit, you know, in the restaurant, I’m sorry, I didn’t remember who you were, and I thought, damn, this is embarrassing, but, I thought you were staring at me, you know, to get my attention, to get my heterosexual attention.
 And, well, then I remembered, of course, that I knew you through the Tickles.
 And she said, I wasn’t just looking at you because I expected you to remember me.
 You know, you’re not bad to look at.
 I could have looked all night, she said.

"I was in bed too--and desperately needed to get out.
 Thanks for the rescue."
 Rick shook his head.
 Dirk, at 28 three years younger than Rick, was as leery of marriage as Rick, but for different reasons.
 He liked having a variety of women to choose from, frequently juggled more than one relationship--if you could call them that--at once, and sometimes seemed to enjoy getting caught at it so that he could put his charm to a real test.
 "I ran into Kim the other day."
 Dirk hit the ball.
 "Kim who?"
 Rick had to run to get it.
 Dirk missed it.

 "I accidentally ended up far away from home and couldn't get back.
 I met someone who took care of me and tried to help me.

 "This friend--he was a man?"
 "Yes."
 She looked her daughter in the eye.
 "Did he treat you properly?"
 "Yes.
 Oh, Mother, I wish you could meet him.

I might know of a person or two who might be interested in helping you out..." Mom's face was nearly as surprised as the time Dad had come home from work and announced he'd just taken the next two days off and we were going up to St.
 Cloud for a vacation starting in twenty minutes.
 I wasn't sure who'd called, or what exactly they were after, but it was looking like she was going to have a really good story to tell when she managed to get off of the phone.
 "I appreciate your interest, but as I said, that really isn't the kind of thing I do.
 Oh.
 Well, I have commitments here, projects I'm working on.
 For three weeks?"
 She looked at me with wide eyes.
 "I'd have to confirm that.
 Can I call you back in half an hour?"

"But how did you know I wanted you to kiss me?"
 "By the way you were looking at me."
 "How was I looking at you?"
 "Like you wanted me to kiss you."
 He grinned again as he reached for the eggs.
 She frowned, trying to remember what expression she must have had on her face that night.
 But she hadn't been thinking about how she looked; she'd been thinking about how he looked.
 And how his lips would feel on hers.
 It was as they were cleaning up after breakfast that inspiration struck her.
 Handing him a tub of butter, she caught his gaze, holding it as she thought about the way he'd kissed her yesterday afternoon.

All agreed that no matter what might happen with the greater sigils that all should gain the minor Sigil of Healing.
 Its benefits to warriors and mages alike were well known.
 Jordaan agreed to do the inscribing and show the others the technique.
 In return Imeralda would inscribe Jordaan who was also eager for the sigil.
 Jordaan had his hand out with the palm facing up.
 At Jordaan’s direction Rodregas put his own, palm up, on top of it.
 The frog went on top and Jordaan’s other hand went on top of the frog.
 Jordaan then said, “This is going to hurt, it will feel like someone is drawing a pattern under your skin with a knife.
 If you pull away before it is done, you will mess up the pattern and it will use up your magic without adding the benefits of the sigil.” As Jordaan finished speaking he looked in Rodregas’ eyes until he nodded his understanding.
 He knew what was coming.

But I couldn’t observe for long.
 I revealed myself and inquired about her previous finds and all the questions that were plaguing me.
 She was furious!
 She screamed and cursed and fumed.
 She was no help with my queries so I was forced to look around myself.
 Whatever had been there lived a little like the imps.
 And there were imp tracks there, but it appeared only one.
 A massive numbers of bowls and jars littered the camp.
 I have no idea who would need so many.
 The fairies like containers, but not of this crude sort—the craftsmanship was almost that of a troll.

I'd never experienced anything like it, every question I answered spawned two more, and he invariably seemed to figure out the underlying reasons I'd done a given thing, or reacted a certain way.
 I'd just finished describing my failed tryout for the school's production of To Kill a Mockingbird, when he hit me with a completely unexpected question.
 "So tell me about both your best date and your worst date before you came here."
 I felt my skin instantly heat up, and looked down, unable to meet his gaze.
 He let me sit there for a couple of seconds, and then reached out and used one gentle finger to nudge my chin up.
 "What's the matter, afraid I'll be jealous?"
 I shook my head, fighting the urge to look back down.
 "No, there isn't anything to be jealous of.
 I'd never been on a single date before Sanctuary, and you know all about what's happened since I arrived."
 His smile was surprisingly reassuring.

 She moaned, letting her head drop back against the roof of the car as he began kissing her neck.
 "I love you, Marie," he whispered, nuzzling her ear.
 He raised his head, wanting to see her face.
 And then he realized that Teri's porch light was on and that she was probably watching to see when she could turn it off.
 Stroking Marie's hair, he pressed a final kiss to her lips.
 "I think we'd better go."

It wasn't until I'd finished dry-heaving and was trying to clean myself back up, that I wondered where they'd been.
 The school building wasn't that big.
 If they'd really been trying to break up the fight, they should have arrived minutes earlier.
 I thought about hiding in the bathroom for a while, but that was exactly the kind of place a girl like Cassie would want to catch me.
 Instead I took a deep breath and walked outside.
 Britney was waiting for me.
 By her expression she'd decided on being mad.
 "Do you realize what you just did?"
 I was still fresh out of witty comments.
 I just shrugged instead.

Beyond all expectations, it worked.
 My heart rate slowed down to something approaching normal, and the room stopped moving around.
 By the time Mrs. Alexander finished taking the roll, and returned her pencil to its customary place behind her ear, I'd stabilized enough that I could read my notes again.
 The group project was due tomorrow, and since Alec hadn't bothered to make an appearance in class since my first day in Sanctuary, it was looking like I'd have to do the whole thing by myself if I wanted to pass.
 Yet another reason to hate him.
 So far I'd had zero luck figuring out why rain puddles in the parking lot sometimes had colors on them, sort of like little earthbound rainbows.
 I turned around and picked a reference book at random.
 It was a weighty thing that might or might not have the answer, but at the very least promised to keep me occupied for the duration of the class.
 I finally found something promising about fifteen seconds before the bell rang.
 I probably would've stayed there trying to cram information into my head, but Mrs. Alexander walked by with a smile on her face as the last of the other students filed out of the room.

People who aren’t turned on by music, any music.
 Man, that’s weird.
 Anyway.
 Back to me, please.
 CM:  	Right.
 Um, when did you get your first real guitar?
 BG:  	That was—oh, when I was eleven, I think.
 I had played around on an old box guitar Dad brought home—I think it was a gift from Mr. Delisi actually.
 We had to sort of sneak it into the house (laughs) but it was old and didn’t sound very good, though I had fun trying to pick out Carter Family or Pete Seeger songs on it.
 Or blues chords.

Can you talk a bit about that time?
 BG:  	First, as we’ve discussed, I don’t see that big a change between Memphis and L.A.
 I mean, geographically, yes, Big City vs. hometown, sure.
 But, as for my art, there’s a direct line from Turntable Poison to Rain and Other Distractions.
 There’s a road if you wanna delineate it.
 CM: 	Really?
 That’s what I want to hear about.
 Not just the line between the works but what was going on in your life.
 I mean, stylistically, you did go from blues/psychedelic rock, in the British invasion vein, to soft rock…
 BG: 	Fuck that distinction.

Rick had kept his promise and come home at 5:30 every day, and he'd apologized for trying to kiss her.
 The last time she'd seen Davis, he'd kissed her so hard that her teeth had cut her lips.
 And he certainly hadn't apologized.
 She touched the ring that Davis had put on her left hand, twisting it.
 Could she spend her entire life with a man like that?
 CHAPTER SEVEN
 In spite of her lack of sleep, Marie awoke early the next morning.
 She couldn't wait to go to the shore.
 After her walk through the garden, Rick wanted to go back to bed for a while, but she begged him to leave right away.
 Excitedly she put on her bathing suit, glad that there was no full-length mirror in her room.

They were allowed to watch filming until lunch, and then they were given a tour of the rest of the studio.
 Marie heard obscenities and shouting, and she saw two different actors storm off two different sets in the middle of their scenes.
 But it was wonderful.
 The actors and actresses were very attractive people, and many of them were nice to her.
 "Today was magic, absolute magic," Marie sighed as they ate steak and salad that evening.
 Rick smiled.
 "You weren't disappointed then?"
 "Not in the slightest."
 "It was what you expected?"
 "No, not really.

I got more than friendly with Gloria Valenciana, who was down from Los Angeles camping with her family.
 Her dad made her turn in early.
 When I joined Eric at our campfire, I asked him why he didn’t seem interested in girls.
 “Half of my friends are girls,” he said.
 “You know what I mean.
 Don’t you get horny?” “Yeah,” he said.
 “Only, for me, it’s too soon.
 I’ve got a bunch more to learn.” The last couple months of that summer, while I smashed golf balls, played baseball in Mexico on Sundays, and visited my cousins in Pacific Beach, Eric ran around with Margaret Beasley, Pam Greenman, and Lane Campbell.
 Margaret had been my friend longer than anyone except my cousins.
 Since second grade.

In the split second between Ben being gently placed back on the stairs, and everyone starting to breathe again, I followed the arm that'd saved him back to see who the hero was.
 Isaac met my gaze as he let go of Ben and then he looked up at Vincent with a stare that was somehow both calm and challenging at the same time.
 "What are you looking at, freak?"
 It was hard to believe Vincent could be so nonchalant after having almost killed someone.
 It'd been an accident obviously, but still that wasn't the kind of thing you just shook off.
 All of the kids that'd been rushing forward to congratulate Isaac for his heroic save started backing away.
 Anxious to avoid the fight, I tried to move with the crowd, but felt a flash of pain as my abused ankle protested.
 For a second I couldn't think about anything other than the agony.
 When I managed to get my eyes to focus again, Vincent was only a couple of inches away from Isaac and hissing something too quiet for me to make out.
 Whatever it was, Vincent was all but foaming at the mouth while Isaac was so controlled it was hard to believe a fight was about to break out.

It was petty, but I waited inside the room until the clock showed exactly the time the lab was supposed to finish, and then joined Britney outside in the oppressive heat.
 The air was so dry I could nearly feel it pulling the moisture out of my body as we started around the school towards where Britney had parked her car.
 As we reached the west side of the building, the high-pitched growl of a performance engine tore a hole in the relative silence.
 The edge of the student parking lot was just barely in view now, but it was enough to see the source of the noise.
 A tiny figure barely recognizable as Rachel, was walking towards a dark-blue bullet bike, which had just roared to life.
 We had to walk several more steps before I recognized the leather-clad, dark-haired figure on the bike as Alec.
 My feet must have unconsciously slowed because Britney was now several steps ahead of me and looking back impatiently.
 I tried to catch up, but Alec chose that moment to look up and stare in our direction.
 He was quite a ways away, and his lovely eyes were covered by a pair of sunglasses, but I somehow knew he was looking at me.
 He handed Rachel a helmet but continued to look at us, at me, while she put it on.

He stood in the shadows, staff in hand, as if allowing us to see.
 The air was still as he inclined his head toward Chevelle and then turned, a long, dark braid whipping behind him as he disappeared into the brush.
 This seemed to mean something to the group, something like relief.
 I stared after him, but Anvil stepped forward, thumping his balled fist against his chest in a gesture I didn’t understand.
 Grey followed, repeating the action and adding a single nod, and Ruby clasped her hands, bouncing excitedly from heel to toe.
 I felt myself drawing back together, tied by the knots in my stomach and mind.
 A tandem wolf howl sounded in the distance.
 My stomach swam in unease.
 Chapter Thirteen Diary
 The councilman’s body was disposed of, and the group bustled around the clearing.

It had felt like I was abandoning Cindi by doing so, but just seeing Cindi's half of the twin pendants we'd received two years before had been enough to send me into a tailspin.
 A detached part of me noted that it was just like Mom to have lied about having lost Cindi's.
 She'd known I couldn't handle the reminder of what we'd lost, but she'd been unwilling to give up that link to the past.
 The thought slipped away like sunlight skipping across water a split second before the storm arrived.
 The attack was a bad one.
 I lost more time.
 I must have slept at some point, but the next time I surfaced it was Saturday morning and I was sitting in front of an empty bowl with an unopened box of cereal and a gallon of milk waiting in the wings.
 At some point I realized I wasn't hungry.
 I put everything back away and went upstairs for a shower.
 It didn't help.

We rented a local storage unit and brought the furniture and clothes there but we tossed out more than we took.
 We filled nearly fifty large black garbage bags of filth and drug paraphernalia and left them for trash pickup in the alley behind the house.
 Most things of value had been stolen or pawned.
 One of these things was the expensive camera we had given him for Christmas.
 It was at the pawnshop.
 Agenda Item Two: Retrieve valuables from the pawnshop.
 The camera was sitting at a local pawnshop as collateral on a loan that expired on the very day we got there for it.
 It was the first time I had ever stepped foot in a pawnshop; it was a shit hole covered with other people’s Christmas and birthday presents.
 It was humiliating for me to be in this place and my son could not look me in the eyes the entire time we were there.
 The walls were lined with guitars, the glass counters held cameras, jewelry and trinkets of all types.

This increase is partially explained by the fact that more than 100 new sovereign nations have emerged, many of which were protected, prior to independence, by the colonial powers that have now withdrawn.
 The acquisition of even modest defensive capabilities may consume a significant portion of national income when the economic base is small, as it is for many of these nations.
 In addition, the increasing incidence of war, terrorism and drug-related violence in the developing world has heightened the sense of insecurity among these countries.
 However, a closer analysis reveals that half of the military expenditure of the developing world is incurred by a small number of oil-exporting countries in the Middle East and North Africa, and another quarter is incurred by other high-income developing nations, mostly in East and South East Asia – whereas the 84 developing nations with lower and lower-middle incomes, including such large nations as China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, comprising 72 per cent of the world’s population, incur roughly 6 per cent of global military expenditure, on average less than 3 per cent of the total GDP of these countries.
 International pressure for defining acceptable levels of military expenditure and reducing defence budgets is entirely warranted, provided that it is applied equitably to all countries, takes into account the varying conditions between regions and nations, and places corresponding limitations on arms exports by industrialized nations.
 Placed under the control of an impartial international agency specialized in security issues, rather than being left to development banks or made an instrument of bilateral policy by donor nations, these measures could effect a further 50 to 75 per cent cut in global defence spending and thereby generate $400 billion to $600 billion per year for non-military purposes, equal to roughly ten times current levels of overseas development assistance.
 The international community should commit itself to a minimum goal of reducing global military expenditure to $400 billion (in 1992 constant dollars) by 2000 AD.
 Military expenditure mitigates but does not resolve the underlying problem of security.
 Today, the most pressing security threats are social, not military.
 The appropriate response to them is greater investment in sustainable human development, not more arms.

Rachel's face tried to take on her liar's mask, but didn't quite succeed.
 "You risked a lot to stop Cassie from hurting me.
 The least I can do is tell you anything I know that could save you from getting hurt in return."
 She was telling the truth.
 Not all of it, but at least some of it.
 I wanted to tell her she didn't owe me anything, but there were so many questions I needed answered still.
 There was some kind of weird power struggle going on, and her brother was right in the middle of it all, but I couldn't ask her about any of it.
 She'd already said as much as she was going to.
 I nodded my thanks, and went to stand again, but she captured my arm before I could complete the motion.
 "There are a lot of things I can't tell you, but anything you want to know about me is fair game.

I focused on one thing at a time.
 Directly below me, I saw Grey.
 He was caught, wrapped in vines as my own body was.
 But there were flames circling his feet.
 I followed his gaze to find his opponent, and then dove.
 I hadn’t put much planning in this, but I was still running on adrenaline.
 I decided the fastest course of action was pecking his eyes out.
 It worked.
 He threw his hands up, covering his face, screaming.
 But he did not attack me.

I was close enough my intent was unmistakable when he grabbed me, wrapping both arms around my biceps in a too-tight grip.
 “Freya—” A howl.
 A wolf.
 He let out a deep breath and it tickled my nose.
 Oh.
 Oh, no.
 No, no, no.
 My head cleared, but Chevelle still held me around the arms.
 My neck flushed, my eyes shooting to my lap.
 I couldn’t look at him.

My hope with Broken and Torn is that the two stories combine into something that both guys and girls can enjoy.
 The girls are likely to start out with Broken, while guys are likely to pick up Torn and enjoy the extra action there.
 Either way, my biggest hope would be that the guys can introduce their wives and girlfriends to Broken, and the girls can introduce their husbands and boyfriends to Torn.
 We've included excerpts for both Torn and Splintered (the sequel for Broken and Torn) below.
 Acknowledgments: A big thanks to all of the fans who are doing so much to help get the word out.
 There are tons of you that I don't know, but I do want to make special mention of a few dependable souls that I'm very grateful to know, and who've helped in various ways with Torn, and who I suspect will continue to go above and beyond with Broken.
 Cassy & Mark, I'm glad you both turned out to be story addicts just like me.
 Thanks for everything.
 Dad, not everyone gets to be best friends with their parents.
 Thanks for all of the feedback and the ongoing support.

 Eugene – Nobody kicked my ass, it just wasn’t really me.
 Jim – So, who beat you up?
 Was it that group of wannabe gangsters that you were trying to join?
 Or was it a real gang?
 Eugene – Nobody Kicked My Ass!
 I’m just not a gangster at heart, it’s not the right way to go.
 Not enough evil.
 I want a more sophisticated evil.

"I love my daughter dearly, but she can be quite a handful.
 A lot of romantic notions in her head, you know.
 That's why I keep such a tight rein on her, and I advise you to do the same.
 Of course, I'm sure that once she's married, she'll settle down and realize that life isn't like those picture shows and books that fill her mind with wild ideas."
 "I'm sure you're right, sir."
 Davis had no intention of letting her get away with the things her father did.
 Of course, she had the old man fooled, but Davis wasn't so easily deceived.
 Marie could tell that something was in the air that day.
 Her father and Davis kept exchanging looks over lunch, and they didn't shoo her and her mother from the table right after lunch so that they could discuss business.
 She suspected that Davis had something special planned for that evening, and when she caught her mother's glance over their teacups, she knew right away that her mother shared her suspicions.

The fire continued to spread.
 Qurrah could see its flickers of light, and even in his little pit he felt the heat.
 His whole body ached, and he wished nothing more than to lay there like a corpse in a grave, but he had no time.
 He needed to take care of the meddlesome elves that had him pinned.
 “Like shadows in the night,” he whispered, remembering how Velixar had described a certain spell to him.
 “Shadows that vanish and reappear at will.”
 He spoke the words and poured his power into them.
 He felt his body shift, and his sight twisted so that he saw many things.
 A spider, he thought.
 Velixar should have told him it was like becoming a spider.

“Thank you, sir!” he squeaked.
 “Her majesty requests that I tell you about you’re real destiny.
 She believes you’ve been in the dark long enough.” “What do you mean?” I questioned.
 “Our real destiny?” “Yes,” he said, a little more relaxed, “it must take place in Igneeria, where you are truly needed.” My brow furrowed in confusion.
 “But wait, aren’t we in Igneeria right now?” The dwarf gave a quick, half-hearted laugh.
 “No miss, you are far from Igneeria.
 You’re in the Half-way, the place between Earth and Igneeria.
 The Half-way can act as a gate, or passage into Earth.
 It seals off the two worlds and if a monster were to make it as far as the Half-way, it would have a truly difficult time completing its journey because it won’t find a way in or out of this place.” “So let me get this straight,” I said slowly, “we’re not in Igneeria right now but some Half-way?” The dwarf nodded, happily.
 “So where’s Igneeria?” The dwarf rubbed his stubby chin.

Steed smiled in acceptance, but not the same smile he’d given his last opponent.
 They stood across from each other and readied themselves.
 Both tensed but neither took the low, wide stance previously used.
 As their eyes fixed on one another, I felt myself, and Ruby beside me, lean forward in anticipation of action.
 Both men went taut, their muscles corded, jaws clenched tight, determined stares focusing only on each other.
 I saw nothing happen but knew there must be something, some unseen force causing them pain, draining them.
 I couldn’t look away but stammered to Ruby, “What’s happening?” “They are trying to overpower one another.” I could hear the pleasure in her voice.
 “No silly games, just power.” The way she said it had some part of my mind wondering whether her statement about not having her mother’s ambition was true.
 But I could only concentrate on the struggle in front of me.
 No visible action.

You know, like I say, I’m not proud of my younger self, but, as Lor says, it’s all real, it’s all honest.
 We are what we are, what we were.
 So, sophomore year was Birdie Burton.
 Shit.
 Should we use real names here?
 I guess, it’s ok.
 I don’t want Debby’s name here, that’s all—her real name, just because.
 Just out of respect for my first love, you know, and the first heart I broke.
 I broke her heart.
 And with Birdie I lost my virginity.

The competitive security paradigm is a state-centred, egocentric approach in which the security of each nation is perceived in terms of its military superiority over potential adversaries.
 The push of each nation for unlimited security through military power is inherently destabilizing, since it inevitably increases the level of insecurity of other sovereign states.
 In practice, the effort of nations to arm themselves against perceived external threats generates a sense of insecurity among other nations and compels them in turn to increase military preparedness, thus initiating a vicious spiral, as it did during the Cold War.
 When NATO and the Warsaw Pact had armed themselves to the point where direct confrontation became too risky, mutual suspicion and insecurity led them to fight each other through proxy wars in the developing world.
 Every move by either side was perceived as a potential security threat, prompting a counter by the other.
 Compounded by the inherent instability of nuclear weapons, this doctrine led to the anomaly of increasing military power and steadily decreasing national and international security.
 This highly militarized approach contains an in-built mechanism for escalation that was responsible for the growth of global military expenditure to an all-time peak of $1.2 trillion in 1988.
 Even when effective in controlling direct aggression between major powers, it encouraged proxy wars and it completely ignored the security needs of countries not aligned with one bloc or another.
 This is one of the reasons why all the wars in the last forty years have taken place in developing countries.
 Taken to its extreme in the nuclear competition of the superpowers, it ‘logically’ led to the astonishing doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD) as the cornerstone of national security policy.

I half expected for the incredible tension I'd been feeling before to disappear, but instead it morphed slightly.
 If I hadn't known it was absolutely absurd, I would've said it felt like there was a tingly wind blowing down the stairs, pushing Vincent along before it.
 Isaac moved slightly.
 It was a small change of position, but somehow incredibly menacing.
 It wasn't until Vincent froze in place that I realized Isaac's shift had kept Vincent squarely between him and Alec.
 It was like watching a pair of wolves bringing down an elk.
 I'd seen gangs work together like this before, but it seemed strangely out of place in Sanctuary.
 I was positive there was going to be a fight after all, but then Vincent grabbed some poor freshman, shoved him into Isaac, and pushed his way downstairs as Isaac caught the human missile.
 As soon as Vincent was safely out of sight, everyone surged forward to congratulate Isaac on having saved Ben, and Ben on having not died.
 ** The near fight between Isaac and Vincent and then Alec's intervention seemed to be the buzz for the next two hours.

His chest bore a personalized crest, an oak leaf on an unbroken shield of gold and acorn brown.
 I watched from the trees as a rainbow of a half dozen tassels fluttered behind him where he rushed down the path toward the village.
 When I walked through the door, I saw immediately Fannie had not expected company.
 The telltale signs of a hurried cleaning spell were everywhere.
 I slipped into one of the low chairs to enjoy a bowl of berries set out for company under the guise of politeness.
 We didn’t often have visitors, and I could count on a new spruce twig the times we’d had fresh berries.
 Might as well enjoy them.
 I popped a ripe juneberry into my mouth as Aunt Fannie rounded the corner.
 She was on her way into the room, having dashed back to her stash of wine as soon as the visitor had hit the door.
 She peered at me out of the corner of her eye, twisting the cork free of the bottle.

Bible translators may avoid the word "beauty" because too many readers might interpret in ways akin to the ’60s motto, “If it feels good, do it.” In my vocabulary, "beautiful" describes a harmony that suggests the eternal.
 Such beauty may harbor sadness, or even a terrifying dread.
 It speaks to us of what Robert Pirsig, in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance terms Quality, and which he proposes as the principle in charge of the cosmos.
 I read somewhere that Dostoyevski once asserted: even if he knew for a fact God didn’t exist, he would continue to believe.
 If he did make that apparently loco remark, I would bet he was trying to express the beauty to which communion with God can lead us.
 Like today, when I find myself delivered far beyond the ordinary, into a realm where the glory of simple hills and pastures, of cows and bluebirds, is such that I know why the prophets described heaven as jeweled and paved in gold.
 Father Zossima in The Brothers Karamazov relates this kind of beauty.
 Before his conversion, in the aftermath of a duel, “’Gentlemen,’ I cried suddenly, speaking straight from my heart, ‘look around you at the gifts of God, the clear sky, the pure air, the tender grass, the birds; nature is beautiful and sinless, and we, only we, are sinful and foolish, and we don’t understand that life is heaven, for we have only to understand that and it will at once be fulfilled in all its beauty, and we shall embrace each other and weep.’”
 Darkness
 For the first time in weeks, a deep sadness grips me.

(It is, of course, a weathered Sinclair sign, imbued with the enchantment Mr. Eggleston brought to all his work, a divergence quite inexplicable.)
 Buddy was loved, revered.
 He was not held to the same rules as everyone else.
 So it goes with the great.
 And when Buddy started using drugs, mixing bennies, reds and laxatives in dangerous quantities, no one was there to question him.
 Of course, drugs were part of the scene then.
 They were everywhere.
 In the back of every minibus, in the bathroom of every nightclub, at practice sessions, in the homes of every groupie.
 And Buddy had his groupies.
 The twins used to joke that Buddy played for scrimption and blow jobs.

And yet I knew everyone was dying.
 Running and screaming and dying.
 I jerked upright in bed, gasping.
 My ears were ringing.
 There was something wet on my face.
 Tears?
 No, blood.
 My nose was bleeding.
 It took a moment to get my bearings.
 My bed sheets were a tangle and my clothes were disheveled.

“Why in all of Dezrel would you be looking for her?”
 “She, um, I kind of…” The half-orc faltered.
 “I owe her a favor.”
 The elf smiled as if trying to appear amused, but it faltered miserably.
 “You are looking in the wrong place,” he said.
 “Search the woods just outside town.
 Call her name a couple times.
 She’ll hear you.”
 “Thank you,” Harruq said, grateful even though his insides churned.
 He had faced many men in battle, and yet here he was, his heart skipping beats at the thought of meeting this mysterious Aurelia.

We threw on our sneakers and snuck out the door.
 The summer night air was cool but a little sticky and clammy, making our bodies feel damp.
 I followed Emily down to the back of the garage, where we sat down and entered the monsters’ world.
 I pushed my green hair back and hid behind a tree beside Emily to watch the dwarfs.
 There must have been more than ten of them gathered together.
 They were parading around a blazing camp fire, mumbling and talking about things I couldn’t hear over the flames.
 Some more emerged from the woods and joined them, their shadows dancing behind them.
 Then all of them suddenly broke out into an ominous song: “He will rise to the heavens, from the very pits of hell.
 To take control of our world, and the gift- less ones as well.
 “He will rule with a flaming torch, and save those who are worthy.

Feeling a surge of affection, she slid her arms around his waist, laying her cheek against his back.
 "How does that feel?"
 "Better than you could ever imagine."
 He sucked in his breath, standing perfectly still.
 He didn't want to be released from her embrace.
 But moments later she pulled away from him.
 "I'm hungry."
 "What do you want to do for dinner?"
 "I don't know.
 More pizza?"

He even seems to be angrier than usual.
 Jim – I’ve noticed that he’s been in a worse mood than normal, but what do you want me to do about it?
 He doesn’t like me any more than he likes the rest of the world.
 I can’t think of anything I can really do for him.
 Art – Maybe not, maybe not.
 He may hate us all for all eternity, but I’m going to try anyway.
 I can’t just let him waste away like this.
 I’ll do my best by him.
 That is about all I can offer him.
 It’s all I could ever offer him, and it was never enough, your mother saw to that.

It’s getting dark.
 Let’s get the horses into the barn.
 If they have been tracking me since I let them out, they don’t seem to want to do any great harm.” With that Rodregas got out of the wagon and started to pull the horses into the barn.
 Their noses were flaring, and he had to pull them almost to the opening.
 As soon as they got close they both went charging in; they sensed the barn was shelter to keep them safe from the Dire Cats.
 Like the farmhouse, the barn was also built of the same impressive large cut stone.
 However, while the stone was in great shape, all other materials seemed to have fallen apart.
 There were several small trees and bushes growing in the barn.
 The floor was also stone, and there was not enough dirt and debris for them to grow very large.
 They had to clear a path to get the wagon in.

"I swear, you've become more absentminded lately than ever before.
 As much time as you spend studying and thinking about your classes, I'm surprised they haven't decided to graduate you a year early."
 I shrugged uncomfortably.
 Since Mom hadn't been interested in the things I could safely tell her without getting grounded, school had become a standard excuse for why I was so distracted.
 "Speaking of which, when do they send out mid-term reports?"
 "I think they do them twice here.
 We missed the first batch, and the second isn't until later."
 I still didn't particularly like lying, but seemed to be doing it more and more often.
 "Anyways, I was just apologizing for leaving you home alone on a weekend again.
 I ran into another trio of hikers, and they told me about a new vantage point for that crooked-looking mountain I keep telling you about.

“This world is young, Qurrah, and Karak and Ashhur are young gods.
 Only five-hundred years ago they came and gave life to man.” Those eyes twinkled.
 “I was one of the first they made.”
 The half-orc pulled his ragged robe tighter about him as he stared into the fire.
 “How is that possible?” he asked.
 A soft wind blew, making the fire dance, and in the flickering flames Velixar smiled.
 “I was the favorite of Karak, my dear orcish friend.
 He gave me life when other men would have long turned to dust.
 When he was defeated, and his servants were cast into the abyss, I alone escaped punishment.”
 “I am not orcish,” Qurrah said, harsher than he meant.

Math was actually the high point of the morning.
 Mrs. Campbell was smart enough to put Britney off in a corner surrounded by the kind of kids she'd never even consider talking to under normal circumstances.
 Not having Britney distract me all hour would have been a blessing by itself, but things got even better when Mrs. Campbell complimented me on the homework I handed in.
 "Most excellently done, Miss Paige.
 Albert said you seemed to pick up the concepts quite quickly.
 I've noticed you've been working on the older material during class, which I very much approve of, but you may want to listen today.
 We're starting a new section, and it should be fairly straightforward for you to pick up."
 I shouldn't have been surprised when she turned out to be right.
 The new chapter was on probability, which had absolutely nothing to do with the stuff they'd been working on the week before.
 I quickly decided I didn't like the new stuff as much as what I'd been studying on my own, but it was relatively easy, and almost before I knew it class had ended and it was time to go to lunch.

A family can look perfect from the outside but be quite the opposite on the inside.
 I have lived such a life.
 I do not know what made me do what I did for my son but I can only surmise that it was a combination of all of the defining moments in my life that lead me to where I am today.
 The beginning .

 Epilogue Names were changed in this work of narrative non-fiction to protect the innocent and the not-so-innocent.
 Steve and Ashley: I would later find out that Steve posted bail and was busted shortly thereafter for robbery and assault as he pistol-whipped and beat his next victim.
 By the time he went to trial for this bust, he had also been busted again for another drug deal.
 Steve is now serving five years in prison.

Rather than searching for a victor and vanquished, the urgent need is to find a successor that combines and synthesizes the enlightened values of both systems – freedom and equality, liberty and security.
 It has been amply proved that the authoritarian state is incapable of exerting a benevolent authority over the people without imposing severe restrictions on freedom, stifling human energy and creativity, leading sooner or later to rising discontent and a loss of social vitality.
 It is also abundantly clear that money as an institution operating through the free pricing mechanism of the market system – although it does succeed in generating high levels of energy, creativity and productivity – regards people as a purchasable commodity or a potential market, but is otherwise indifferent to human values and welfare.
 Neither the determinism of the state nor the determinism of the market can be adequate in themselves to achieve the goals of peace and prosperity that we strive after.
 It has been generally assumed that the transition now taking place in Eastern Europe will sooner or later lead these countries to adopt forms of government and economy identical to those prevalent in the West.
 But for those raised in a society that offered a great measure of social security, the poverty and insecurity of the Western system are gross inadequacies.
 While it is clear that these new democracies have rejected the authoritarian statist system, it is not yet clear what finally they will accept, discover or invent as a more acceptable alternative.
 The creativity and inventiveness they have exhibited in seeking an alternative in the past may quite possibly lead them to discover that better social system which both East and West are in need of.
 Viewed from an evolutionary perspective, we may surmise the general direction and likely destination of that quest.
 The requirements of the state and the market must eventually give way to the needs of people.

He would make them both pay.
 The tip of a sword pressed against the side of his neck, drawing blood from the slightest pressure.
 “He looks mad,” said the guard.
 “Died fighting us, don’t that sound right?”
 Every muscle in Harruq’s body tensed, knowing his moment to act would need to be perfect.
 Before he could, a feminine voice shouted down the alley, startling all three.
 “Both of you, stop that this instant!”
 Through blurred vision, Harruq saw a woman with auburn hair standing at the edge of the alley.
 The patrolmen also turned to look, their weapons still in hand.
 “Who the abyss…‌oh, go on back to your forest, Aurelia.

You must be ready for this.” I felt my stomach do sick flip-flops.
 I wasn’t ready.
 “Anyway,” the dwarf said quickly, obviously seeing our surprised faces, “I think all of you can deal with that.
 Shall we go?” Seth shrugged, “I guess.
 The answer to that question doesn’t really matter.” The dwarf held his hand out, “Shall we go then?” I shrugged, “Lead the way, shorty.” The dwarf gave me an annoyed look and walked towards the arch.
 I expected him to go right through but he disappeared in a swirl of black mist.
 Jason shrugged and ran in after him.
 “Wait Jason,” Emily called.
 “Dang, never mind.” She disappeared too.
 I went to follow her and hesitated.

The Grand Marshal will be coming soon for the official moment for me to take on a greater sigil, and I don’t think we want them to find these chambers.” As Rodregas walked from the chamber of the One Tree he felt more regret than when he had left the Infernal chamber; though in all likelihood the sigil from the Night Panther would prove to be of more use on his quest.
 The three walked as one to the Celestial Lion.
 They looked first at the great beast and then at Rodregas.
 “Are you sure I have the magical strength to take on two greater sigils?” he asked Imeralda.
 “Few have such strength; taking a second greater sigil seems to consume far more power than one.
 It is not just twice as much, but far more.
 Only the most powerful have such magic, but you have the power of an Immortalist mage.
 I can’t promise it, but you should have such magical strength.” Doi’van and Imeralda watched silently as he reached out to touch the Celestial Lion, his hand again drawn to its mane.
 This time no voice spoke up to warn him away.
 The fur of the mane was surprisingly rough to the touch, and strangely, Rodregas smelled grass.

The third time it happened, I stopped pretending not to notice and shot Britney a sugar-sweet look of my own.
 She didn't quite seem to know how to take that and the rest of the class passed quickly.
 All too soon, it was time to go up and talk to Mrs. Campbell.
 I put off the ordeal as long as I could, waiting until everyone but Britney and I had exited the room.
 Britney looked particularly unhappy.
 Mrs. Campbell was looking at my homework when I reached her desk.
 "I was prepared to tear into you for not going to the tutoring lab last night, but that hardly seems fair seeing as how you went ahead and did the work by yourself."
 I felt a small glow of satisfaction flare into life, but her next words ensured it didn't get out of hand.
 "Of course, you've got the right answers, and technically you're attacking the problems correctly, but you're leaving out a couple of steps that I think will give you problems a bit later on.
 Please take my advice and spend a little bit of time at the math lab.

If he lost, it would be much harder.
 Karun would have thirteen and he would have nine points.
 He was not sure how Geriodon or Nordien or the other leading contestants were doing.
 At the bell the two started to circle.
 Karun was a large woman.
 She was tall and unusually muscular.
 She moved with an easy cat-like grace and was attractive, in an about to kick your ass sort of way.
 She was probably of the blood and strong.
 She had her brown hair woven into a tight braid and wore well fitting chain and leather armor.
 Her sword and shield seemed to be of excellent quality.

 Liz – What kind of ‘event’ prevented you from seeing the dream masterpiece?
 Jim – Our mothers showed up…

His mind attuned, he carved into the remains of a man’s heart.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 On his way back home, the threepence jingling in his hand, Harruq spotted a patrol of guards approaching.
 He glanced to the right, where the small alley led back to their shed.
 If he hurried, he might be able to make it before they noticed…
 He was halfway down the alley when he heard a voice call out.
 “Hey!”
 Harruq kept going.
 He was used to harassment and verbal abuse from the guards.

 Rick noticed her glazed eyes.
 "Are you tired?"
 "A little."
 "Found anything helpful?"
 "No.
 Well, maybe.
 A number of scientists--men who called themselves scientists, that is--have built different types of machines, but I don't think you and I could do that.
 They had no really provable success, anyway."
 She shook her head, turning a page.

Without a universal ban, the efforts of the nuclear powers to stop proliferation lack moral authority.
 Arguments are often advanced that nuclear weapons cannot be ‘dis-invented’, and that the danger of a rogue state or terrorist group acquiring and threatening use of these weapons necessitates that the present nuclear powers retain them for such a contingency.
 With the massive conventional firepower already available, nuclear weapons are not needed for defence, even against a rogue state with nuclear capability, and they do not represent a credible defence against terrorism under any circumstances.
 How could nuclear weapons conceivably be used to retaliate against terrorism?
 Alternative solutions can be found to address these threats far more effectively.
 Similar arguments were made in the past against complete eradication of chemical weapons.
 The new treaty for the abolition of chemical weapons provides a useful model.
 Chemical weapons technology is far easier to acquire and violations of the treaty are far more difficult to verify.
 The fact that a comprehensive universal treaty to abolish one category of weapons of mass destruction is now a reality proves that political will rather than technical factors is the crucial element.
 The Chemical Weapons Treaty also shows that negotiation of such a treaty need not take decades.

I threw my hands back to steady myself.
 It felt like a wall of stones behind me.
 I didn’t look back, though, because just as I’d regained my footing, I heard the howls.
 Before the next breath, a new sound—a closer sound—filled my ears.
 Shoosh, shoosh, shoosh.
 It took longer than it should have to realize they were arrows.
 My mind couldn’t seem to process the scene fast enough.
 Before I could distinguish the threats, they were changing.
 The hands I’d splayed against the wall of stones for support were now in bonds.
 I forced myself to look away from Ruby’s back, her arms stretched out defensively, to see what was holding me.

The answer fell out of my mouth of its own accord.
 It took me several seconds to realize it was the truth.
 I didn't have a ride home until Britney finished up her regular studying stint.
 "For Britney?
 Do you want us to give you a ride home?"
 A slight movement, barely seen out of the corner of my eye, gave meaning to the last part of the sentence.
 A familiar-looking guy was standing a few feet from Rachel.
 I couldn't place him.
 I slowly shook my head, trying to jar something loose enough to figure out who he was.
 "Please, Adriana.

"I wish I could say yes.
 I love you, Rick."
 He didn't respond for a few moments, needing to let his desire ebb.
 "If I hadn't asked you, if I'd just gone on kissing you and touching you, we would have made love.
 You wouldn't have stopped me."
 This time she did blush.
 "You're probably right."
 She thought about his words, frowning.
 "Ever since I was 16 or so, my mother has told me not to allow a young man to take liberties.
 But ever since we came back from Hollywood, I've let you-let you .

Simply by being in the same town as us, she automatically made every other girl in school feel like bloated, heifers.
 Surely she was somehow cheating to be doing so well in the subtle, nasty game in which every high-school girl ranked herself against every other female.
 I probably would've spent the rest of the day depressed, but once she was out of my line of sight I was able to see the boy following her.
 He was incredible.
 Just looking at him drove every other thought out of my mind.
 If the girl who'd just walked by me without acknowledging the existence of any of us lesser beings was every boy's ideal physical specimen, the boy was every girl's dream.
 A gorgeous fantasy breathed into life by some merciful goddess, one who wanted to give us each a glimpse of what awaited good little girls in the afterlife.
 Skin that was a gorgeous shade of tan, not at all artificial-looking, disappeared into the collar of a thin, light-blue button-down shirt.
 The cut of his clothing hinted at designer origins, but the garment was mostly notable for the way it stretched over a pair of broad shoulders that looked like they'd been chiseled from marble, or possibly cast in bronze.
 My eyes made it as far as the equally impressive chest before I forced them upwards.

Ruby was telling stories.
 She related the tale of Bonnie Bell, a blue fairy from the East.
 “He hunts the human children, luring them in with glitter and lights, and eats them, beginning with their tiny little toes.
 Though he gives no choice in the matter, in exchange, he allows the mother one wish.” I scoffed, “Humans aren’t real.” “Even so,” she continued, smiling wickedly, “you’d be surprised how many don’t think to wish for their children back.” Raucous laughter floated up around the ring.
 Fairy tales indeed.
 It felt good being there, surrounded by my new companions, a fire and stories, laughter.
 This was more of a home than Fannie’s had ever been.
 But I was also under the influence of a fairy.
 “Better yet?” Ruby asked.
 I grimaced.

"Of course, you've got the right answers, and technically you're attacking the problems correctly, but you're leaving out a couple of steps that I think will give you problems a bit later on.
 Please take my advice and spend a little bit of time at the math lab.
 Even if you can't make it every day, you need to come in a few times a week."
 "Yes, ma'am."
 The scolding actually hadn't been that bad, almost like disguised praise.
 Britney looked like she was hoping for something similar, but Mrs. Campbell's expression quickly dashed that idea.
 "You on the other hand definitely need to spend every night at the math lab.
 Your homework was incomplete, and of the problems you bothered to attempt, you didn't do a single one correctly.
 Britney, you're headed towards a failing grade, and while you might not care, your father most certainly does.
 Make my class a priority, or I'll stop in for a checkup and let slip just how poorly you're doing to dear old Dad, and then you'll find yourself riding the bus to school."

This effort will be given strong impetus by establishing democracy as a minimum condition for membership and participation of states in the affairs of the UN.
 It is true that the UN stands for diversity and pluralism, but not when it comes to freedom and human rights.
 True pluralism and diversity can only be exercised and enjoyed by people in freedom.
 Recognizing the considerable effort that will be needed to prepare still subject people and to train national leaders in democratic institutions and processes, all possible support should be extended by the international community to make available the knowledge and skills needed to build viable political institutions.
 The UN should establish a graded, time-bound programme for the transformation of authoritarian states.
 Should the people of any country themselves prefer an alternative system, let them freely make that choice by electoral process.
 Suspension of voting rights or of the privileges of membership should be the ultimate penalty for the failure of governments to comply with this condition within a reasonable period of time.
 The affirmation of democratic principles cannot and will not stop with the domestic governance of member countries.
 It is inevitable that the same principles be extended to the relationships between the nations that make up the international community.
 The present structure of the UN system is a product of the Second World War, just as the League of Nations was of the First.

Alec looked like he wanted to say something else, but finally nodded and sat down in the next chair over.
 It wasn't as good as if he'd gone all the way back to his seat, and it was extremely out of character, but it was better than nothing.
 I breathed a sigh of relief that he wasn't going to continue fishing for compliments, and returned to my drawing.
 I knew I should open my books back up and study, but it was starting to take shape, and I figured it was only a few minutes away from becoming recognizable.
 Once that happened my meager drawing skills would evaporate and I'd have to stop anyways.
 For whatever reason every time I tried to work on something after I realized what it was, I completely ruined it.
 One of many reasons why I'd never really pursued drawing.
 A short time later I surfaced again and looked down to find a familiar landscape.
 The body of water had morphed into an oblong pond with a crescent island positioned almost exactly in the center.
 I still remembered the first time I'd been told a monster had taken a bite out of the island, and that was the reason it was so oddly shaped.

Blood ran from where Harruq had broken his nose.
 “Name a price, name it, anything, just name it!”
 Harruq glanced at Qurrah, who only chuckled louder.
 “We have little need for riches, noble.
 All we want is you.”
 The man paled.
 “Me?
 What do you want me for?
 The elves…‌they sent you to attack me, didn’t they?
 Whatever they paid you, I can double it.

Qurrah glimpsed an elf carrying a bow.
 Just one, the half-orc noticed, but that would quickly change.
 “Perhaps you’ll have some use after all,” Qurrah said to the bones.
 He whispered words of magic as the elf took a few steps closer and notched an arrow.
 A purple fire surrounded the bones, pulled them into the air, and then hurled them in a giant wave.
 The elf released his own arrow, but Qurrah was faster.
 He dove to the side as the arrow clacked against the stone.
 The elf tried batting the bones away, but he was a fool, unaware of the strength guiding them.
 They shattered his bow, crashed into his slender form, and tore flesh and armor.
 “Kill him,” Qurrah said to the bones.

Wider Perspective on Transitions
 The outcome of all great social transformations – of which the present instance ranks in magnitude and importance with that of the French Revolution and the movement which freed India and so many other former colonies from imperialism, economic exploitation and cultural domination – depends on the degree to which individuals and institutions within the society have been prepared to understand, accept and respond to the new environment ushered in by the transition.
 Two hundred years ago the people of France were ready to overthrow the old order but ill-prepared to create anything new, with the result that the old soon re-established itself and lived on for another century.
 It took India’s leaders more than four decades to prepare their people for freedom and it has taken another four to overcome the vestiges of colonial rule that prevented the country from releasing its energies for prosperity.
 Long after the foreign conquerors had left, colonialism lived on in the institutions of government and in the attitudes of the population.
 Decades of freedom and education were needed for the country to outgrow a sense of inferiority, a seeking for security, a feeling of submissiveness and complacency, and to acquire a sense of pride, ambition, high aspirations and expectations, a seeking for achievement, and a spirit of adventure and enterprise – and still the task is not complete.
 Development is like a chemical reaction that is determined by the variety and quantity of elements present and the conditions under which they are put together.
 If one essential element or condition is missing, a social transition like a chemical reaction may not take place at all.
 The absence of peace in war-torn Africa or democratic freedoms in former colonial nations, the absence of social stability or an entrepreneurial class, the absence of a functioning banking or educational system, the absence of the minimum necessary infrastructure for transportation and communication – any one of these may be enough to prevent transition until the deficit is made up.
 If even an inessential element or condition is missing, the process of transition may take much longer than would otherwise be necessary.
