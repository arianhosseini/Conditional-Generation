He’ll need to try it on someone else first.” Someone else?
 Who else was bound?
 She could see I was prepared to argue.
 “It isn’t safe.” “And if it doesn’t work?” She didn’t answer.
 I remembered the story of her father then, how he’d been released after the fairy’s death.
 I faced Chevelle.
 “If the council member who bound me dies, then will I be released?” He plainly regretted what he’d divulged that morning, but something else rested just below his reluctance.
 Something hopeful.
 Something that burned beneath my skin.
 He answered, “Yes.” “Then we kill them.” And if we don’t know which ones?

There was no point in pretending that she was in 1927.
 The clothes couldn't change what had happened.
 Even getting home tomorrow wouldn't change what had happened, what she’d finally realized tonight.
 She went downstairs and turned on the TV, wondering where Rick was.
 She felt bad for running away from him.
 She knew she must have hurt him, and the last thing in the world she wanted was to hurt Rick.
 He was the sweetest, kindest, most wonderful man in the world, and he couldn't help it if his kisses confused her, made her .

"Delicious."
 "Not really.
 But I'll make you a good dinner."
 She enjoyed her lunch, the conversation as well as the food.
 Rick told her about how easy it was to get on an airplane any day and go anywhere in the world, about machines that made the house warm in winter and cool in summer, about telephones you could carry in your pocket.
 It was all so amazing.
 She'd always felt that she was living in very modern times—electricity, automobiles, the new talkie.
 The wonders Rick described seemed like magic.
 They settled down on his sofa after lunch.

 “He killed five guards before he was slain.

 “What does that mean?” the other elf asked, his fingers twitching at the string of his bow.

My anxiety must have shown; Ruby shifted her jaw.
 “No.” I held up a hand up to stop her.
 “No more dust.” I stood.
 “Let’s just get back.
 Back to training.” They didn’t argue, though they were plainly concerned.
 We went to the ridge with the others, but we didn’t train.
 In fact, I was fairly certain Ruby and Chevelle were avoiding me.
 I waited through the morning and finally—around midday—I gave up and relaxed onto the ground, staring up at the sky.

As a result of the decline of global military spending by one-third in real terms since 1988, employment in defence industries has fallen steeply and is expected to decline by at least 3 to 4 million jobs or roughly 25 per cent by 1998.
 In addition, 4.5 million military personnel will be demobilized during this period.
 The break-up of COMECON and the USSR have had a strongly negative impact on trade within Eastern Europe and with the industrialized West and developing countries.
 The relatively high interest rates in Europe, resulting in part from tight monetary policies pursued by Germany to offset the enormous costs of reunification, have had adverse effects on investment, growth and employment in the region.
 More recent rate increases in the US threaten to halt the declining trend in unemployment observed over the past year.
 The extreme disruption of the centrally planned economies of Eastern Europe during the early stages of their transition to market economies has led to high domestic unemployment in most cases.
 Slow recovery from the recent global recession has restrained the growth of foreign trade.
 Down-sizing by major corporations in response to intense competitive pressures has eliminated many jobs which are not being restored, even after the recession is over.
 Privatization and restructuring of public sector companies in response to fiscal pressures has had a similar effect.
 In the United Kingdom alone, an estimated 500,000 jobs will be lost for this reason in 1994.

Since it's so early, why don't I do that before we go out to the garden?"
 He started to say that he wasn't hungry, but he wanted to put off her walk in the garden as long as possible.
 So he helped her make breakfast and then managed to swallow most of his.
 Out in the garden, he took her hands, gazing down at her.
 "I won't kiss you like I did yesterday.
 But I want you to know how very much I love you."
 She smiled, raising her lips to his for a brief kiss.
 As she wandered off, Rick focused his mind on the TV shows they'd watched last night.
 He replayed all the details of the plots, being sure that he saw, in his mind's eye, all the colors.
 Then he began thinking about planes, remembering his trip with Marie to Los Angeles.

Steed, Anvil, and Grey greeted us before we resumed training.
 I tried to keep my mind off the wolves, off the reason we were training, off the encounter with Chevelle, off all of the terrible things it kept returning to, and I was grateful for the fog that clouded my thoughts.
 Though I wasn’t exactly winning matches, I was getting better.
 The battering continued, and long days of constant fighting were making me tired.
 We took a break and I leaned back on a rock, staring at the sky as I rested.
 Chevelle walked me to the edge of a tall peak.
 The rock mountain ended in a sheer cliff, straight down into haze.
 He looked into my eyes like he saw something there, like he really knew me.
 We gazed out over the cliff, at the horizon… endless.
 I felt his hand on my back and closed my eyes, relaxing into the comfortable, familiar feel of it.

Rodregas thought he saw other movement as well, farther out, but it was more animal-like.
 He was surprised any wild animals would be this close to the noise of a fight.
 Rodregas waited for an opening, but it was hard to know exactly what was going on in the dark.
 He was bleeding from his belly wound, and decided that he could not wait.
 Rodregas decided to pull his short swords from the harness on his side and, at the same time, rush in on the big guy.
 The large attacker was big and powerful, but his rake had shattered and Rodregas had his short swords on his harness.
 His attacker appeared to not have a back up weapon.
 Then a voice rang out, “Stop, STOP, it is not him!
 It is not the Sorcerer Ravenhurr.” It was a woman’s voice.
 Then a much deeper voice, one that seemed half growl, responded, “She is right.

He ducked underneath the swing, feeling the air of the cut just inches above his head.
 Then he was up, both hands gripping his sword tightly.
 Harruq came charging in, both swords striking.
 The guard parried one after the other, constantly retreating.
 The others came to his aid, swinging careful, tentative blows.
 All three tried to engage without being put at risk, much like men prodding a bull.
 Of course, the result was similar.
 The bull got madder.
 “If you’re gonna fight me, fight me!” he yelled.
 He ignored several strikes, accepting the cuts so he could close the distance between him and his opponent.

You can cast magic right?” Aurelia nodded.
 “Well, he can too.

 It seemed Qurrah would leave it at that, but he clearly saw the apprehension on his brother’s face.

 “I can’t do it,” he said.

It wasn't until we hit the first store that I started to get an idea of what Donovan had been hinting at.
 The shyness Rachel normally exhibited at school was replaced by supreme confidence the moment we crossed the threshold of the first store.
 Armani, Versace, Prada, we conducted a tour de force of them all along with others whose names I didn't even recognize.
 The shopping trip was ostensibly for me, but Rachel cajoled both Jasmin and Dominic into dressing rooms on more than one occasion.
 Amazingly enough, everything she picked out for them fit so perfectly that I began to agree with them that there wasn't much point in even trying anything on.
 The first store we stopped at didn't take us seriously until Rachel pulled out a black American Express, after which every sales person in the entire place lined up to assist us.
 Once we each sported a bag or two from some ridiculously over-priced store, things went much more smoothly.
 I tried on a variety of jeans, blouses, shirts, skirts, dresses, and just about every other article of clothing imaginable.
 I drew the line at a swimsuit, since there was no way on earth I'd ever wear one, and then felt so bad at how crushed Rachel was that I let her drag me into a store full of formals.
 It was a mistake because I soon found myself being zipped into a delicate, green dress that I was absolutely positive wasn't going to survive the experience of trying to wrap itself around me.

Dark had fallen.
 Hundreds of us lost souls crowded in front of the portable stage somewhere around the goal line.
 I suspected the others, like me, wanted to get near Billy Graham and his giant companions, for comfort and to borrow some of their power.
 The singing giant led a few thousand folks in a hymn.
 “Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling, calling oh sinner come home, come home, come home, ye who are weary come home…” I mumbled the surrender words I heard someone else say, and waited.
 Cliff had stayed beside me.
 I believe he mumbled too.
 I looked for the girl with auburn hair, and wondered if she had bolted, too proud or afraid to surrender.
 Then a kid tapped me on the shoulder.
 I tapped Cliff and we followed the kid.

 “Ruby, please take Frey back to the house.” Chevelle was standing behind us.
 I was too exhausted to jump, but Ruby merely glanced back at him, not at all surprised he was there.
 Her face crinkled.

 I couldn’t tell if it was with Ruby or whatever hadn’t gone well.

She couldn't even imagine touching Davis like this, and she didn't think it had anything to do with morals.
 She just didn't feel comfortable enough with him to do something this personal.
 Yet here she was running her hands all over the back of a man she'd known only a week.
 Was it a difference in morals?
 Or times?
 Or was it Rick?
 She'd never known a man so warm and kind and open.

 “Captain Intreg, do you mind asking a few questions to confirm his status?” The Knight seemed uncomfortable under the hand of the sorcerer but nodded and said to Rodregas, “What is the eighth law of Chivalry?” “Thou shalt never offer combat to someone who is not equal in strength, unless in defense of the honor of the Order, for Justice for the oppressed or in defense of the weak,” he answered.

It provides us with an opportunity to synthesize these forces in a manner which balances individual freedom with collective action to eradicate the blatant manifestations of poverty, social injustice and inequity.
 Economic liberalism and rising investment in developing countries: One immediate result of this reconciliation has been the recent movement of economic liberalization spreading throughout the developing world, accompanied by the relaxation of bureaucratic constraints that impede growth.
 This trend has stimulated a dramatic increase in foreign investment in these countries, which has risen nearly six-fold during the past seven years.
 Private loans and foreign direct investment together are now approximately twice the level of total overseas development assistance.
 This investment provides additional benefit in the form of increased transfer of technology and management skills, increased access to export markets and a reduction in the cost of capital.
 Defence cuts: The monumental and extravagant waste of human, material, scientific and financial resources resulting from the preparation, execution and consequences of armed conflict are too staggering to quantify.
 In financial terms alone, direct expenditure on defence over the past decade was roughly equivalent to the value of the entire world’s gross annual product.
 The $400 billion reduction in global military expenditure achieved during the past seven years can be matched by a further saving of equal or greater magnitude, representing four times the current combined annual levels of foreign aid and international capital flows to developing countries.
 The freeing of an additional $400 billion a year for development would be sufficient to finance the eradication of poverty worldwide.
 Less than 3 per cent of this saving is sufficient to eradicate the diseases that now claim the lives of 25,000 children every day.

A sharp pain in his gut dragged Harruq from his dreams.
 He lifted open a single eye and glared at the blurry image of his brother.
 “The sun is almost up,” Qurrah said, kicking him again.
 “You need to be as well.”
 “What are you…‌awww, damn it.”
 He sat up straight and shook his head, trying to clear the fuzz that clogged the vast empty space between his ears.
 Qurrah helped by offering a third kick, this one right to the kidney.
 Harruq gasped and staggered to his feet.
 He was outside their little home in seconds, urinating on the grass.
 “Hadn’t pissed yet,” Harruq shouted to his brother.

 Harruq was prepared. “But you heard out92m loud0m,” Qurrah yelled, ‘Now we need you to start kicking! ‘ We never got a clue where to start. But Harruq heard one thing. “Arab-ghah!

I wasn’t aware the room had grown silent until I wiped her ears and heard my own gasp.
 They were slightly rounded at the tips… almost blunt.
 I realized I had stopped breathing as I read, so engrossed in the story.
 I reached up absentmindedly to stroke the tops of my ears.
 I looked up then, at the elders who surrounded me.
 Their faces were astonished.
 “She is… human,” they said.
 I took a steadying breath and spat out, “No.” They stared at me, incredulous.

 Chapter Two Chevelle
 I was usually a late sleeper, but the next morning I was out of the house early.
 I wanted to get away before I had to face Fannie in the middle of her wine hangover, and I knew Junnie could tell me if Evelyn had turned the town or Council against me.
 I rushed up the path and through the village gate, keeping my head down.
 No one generally went out of their way to speak to me, but I didn’t want to take any chances.
 The other elves didn’t have much use for one who wasn’t able to contribute.

 "A parking lot?"

 When you feel comfortable, I might let you drive around some quiet neighborhoods, but you need to study the rules of the road so you can get a license.

Ruby brought me the book again and I took one long, deep breath before I started back.
 Freya is growing and strong.
 She has amassed a following of sorts, though I suspect it is somehow connected to her frailties.
 There is something endearing about it, but some of it worries me.
 She doesn’t seem to be able to hear as well as she should through her rounded ears and her voice is oddly alto.
 She is a beauty, though, her unusual features earning her extra attention.
 The elders express their anxiety again that the humans will consume us, but my father is already discussing arranged marriages, even mentioning Rune’s son, of all people.
 He’ll do anything he can to gain power from her.

You get where I am going with this.
 I always found it ignorant when someone would advise me how to raise my child when they had no children at all or they had children younger than mine.
 The most absurd statements begin with the words “my children will never."
 I never offered advice to any parent, and I never welcomed a statement about raising my children that began with the words “you should.” I have always tried to be the best dad I could be, because it was up to me to make their upbringing different than mine.
 I coached their soccer, baseball and football teams for many seasons.
 I walked my boys to school, helped with their homework (as much as I could) and I tried to be an important part of their lives as well as a positive influence.
 As I continued to succeed in business, our lifestyle improved.
 Throughout their childhoods, we’ve had a good life and a beautiful home, nice cars, good communities, and the best of schools.
 I encouraged their interests by making sure they had the equipment they needed to pursue them.

He was introduced to many people.
 It was late as the other knights went to find sleep when both Doi’van and Imeralda suddenly both appeared.
 He could see from their body language that they were ready to do more than congratulate him.
 CHAPTER 15 DARK SHADOWS
 Doi’van led the three deeper into the great cathedral and said, “Sir Rodregas, congratulations are in order for becoming a Knight of the Soaring Heavens, but I fear Van’dret is getting suspicious.
 You now have the right to enter the Chamber that holds the greater sigils.
 I think you need to go there now.” Rodregas nodded.
 “Can I bring you two into the Chamber as my advisors?” “That does seem to be allowed,” said Imeralda, “Traditionally that is more about fathers with sons, not half bloods and Hellborns, but I think we might have a bigger problem.” She stopped speaking mid sentence, and Rodregas curiously looked back at her, but she was staring ahead.
 A figure stood there tall and graceful.
 He had appeared out of nowhere, as if by magic.

Boys who didn't behave much at all like any other popular kids I'd ever known.
 Alec hated me, Brandon stopped by to give me a ride to school every day, and neither of them should have even realized I was alive.
 If I couldn't be at home, couldn't the universe have at least arranged for me to get involved with a nice, normal, uncomplicated, plain-looking boy, or barring that to remain safely uninterested in boys altogether?
 At the very least, someone out there should have managed to keep the air conditioning working.
 By the time English ended, I felt worse, albeit for different reasons than earlier in Biology.
 Luckily, Algebra was starting to become a real sanctuary.
 The fact that we had a test made everyone even more focused than normal.
 Considering how on-task and busy Mrs. Campbell normally kept the class that was a feat in and of itself.
 I scanned through the first problem, and then picked up my pencil and got started.
 Having successfully finished my test with ten minutes to spare, I expected lunch to bring more of the same kind of anxiety that I'd just managed to push out of my mind.

"That's okay.
 Things like that are always coming through Vegas.
 We can just go the next time they come to town."

 Cars were scary.

 Things that weren't any of their business, things you weren't ready to discuss.
 Somehow I knew Rachel wouldn't pry.
 It was like keeping so many secrets for her brother had made her especially sensitive to other people's secrets.
 Another few steps brought us to the door, and I held it open for Rachel to follow me outside.

Really.” He shifted closer and I became wholly aware of his hands at my waist.
 The grip he’d used to steady me became softer and yet, at the same time, his fingers tightened around me.
 My breath hitched as he pulled me against him, the length of our bodies touching.
 My throat went dry, black spots swirling in my vision.
 I fought to stay focused on his face, so close.
 His eyes grew troubled and then he blurred out of vision as I went limp in his arms.
 “Frey…” I opened my eyes to the darkening sky.
 “What happened?” “You seem to have blacked out,” Chevelle said, a hint of some emotion under his reassurance.
 I blushed.
 He must have seen that coming, held me because of it, simply to prevent me from falling on my face.

 No doubt some readers will agree with my friend Don Merritt and wonder why I’m allowed on the loose.
 I had a blog called Writing and the Spirit which I suspect Don read so that, at the least mention of any Christian thought or word, he could express his horror.
 In response to a post about Michelangelo having devoted his last years motivated by the idea that his work could assure his salvation, Don wrote: “I still cannot believe that the Ken I knew in the old days can use these phrases [win his salvation, eternal life, the principles Jesus taught] with a straight face, that you really believe these odd, old, irrational superstitions.
 Maybe you have already gone over the edge.” He could be right.

Part of me kept expecting Brandon to come running towards me from the direction of the party.
 He'd apologize, and explain how he'd wanted to stop Cassie, but he'd been too stunned by what she was doing.
 Even the delusional part of my brain that was trying to come up with a way to be rescued couldn't create a plausible scenario from there on.
 The look he'd given me at the end hadn't been that kind of shocked gaze.
 Cassie's threat was too vivid.
 Instead of curling up on the ground where I'd fallen, I pulled myself back up and continued to stumble along in the direction I thought would eventually get me back to the road.
 The washed-out landscape mocked me as I realized just how alone I was.
 Rachel didn't like me anymore, she'd never forgive me.
 I'd managed to alienate everyone from Alec's group, and now Brandon had tossed me aside like so much trash.
 It was too much.

His symptoms seemed to be suddenly better and his detox wasn’t as severe as we thought it would be or as bad as it had been the first time years before.
 And I cocked my head and listened more carefully to his lies— the lies which I suddenly realized were consistent with his past behavior when he was high.
 Stop the presses!
 I sprung up and shook my finger in the air in front of his face.
 “Are you high right now, Brandon?” “Nah.” He looked at his Converse.
 “When was the last time you took Oxy?” No response.
 Brandon shuffled his feet and stretched his spine, scratched the corner of his eye, but as is consistent with his behavior, continued to lie and deny.

I was alone in her bed, but could hear an exchange of low whispers from the open door as she and Steed conversed in the front room.
 I wasn’t about to announce I had woken.
 My head didn’t throb as before, no sour mouth.
 It was overall a much better experience.
 But who could stand the dreams?
 I rolled to my side, rubbing the sleep from my face.
 There were a few books on the bedside table and I reached over to draw the top one near.
 I flipped idly through the pages, until I recognized it was detailing the different aspects of magic.
 I hurriedly scanned through, getting caught on a section marked Exchange.

 He was incredulous, staring at Chevelle when he spoke.

 Chevelle had gone rigid, every muscle tense.
 The councilman struggled, suffering from some unseen force.
 Blood poured from his nose and I gasped.
 Chevelle’s head jerked toward me and I couldn’t catch my breath—his eyes were as black as onyx.
 When his focus returned to the men, they eased away, the first supporting other by an arm as both bowed slightly, stepping and stumbling in their retreat.

Rick, thankfully, was in his own shower when she went downstairs and out to the garden.
 She didn't really think she'd be able to get back on a clear, bright afternoon, but she needed to put herself closer, emotionally at least, to home.

 She wasn't in the living room or kitchen.

“Hello,” it said.
 Emily propped herself up on her elbow.
 “Hi, what are you?” “An augothas.” it replied and fluttered its wings.
 “Are you a half-ling?” “Yes, how did you know?
 Is it that obvious?” The augothas seemed to cock its head.
 “Well you can't be a faery because you don't have the ears and you can't be a pixie because they're always giggling around.
 How can you understand me?” Emily shrugged.

The horror of being trapped in a body that was riddled with old injuries was something thousands of people faced every day, but it seemed even more of a shame for someone who'd once been so vital and strong.
 Mallory's smile held only the faintest hint of regret.

Rapid progress has been made during the intervening years to reduce international tensions, but little has yet been done effectively to address the food issue.
 Now that opportunity is before us and compels us to act, for without significant progress on abolishing hunger from the earth, our efforts at arms control and peace making may come to naught.
 Increasing the availability of food and jobs form essential components of a comprehensive strategy to eradicate hunger, poverty and violence from the world.
 Food Security
 Despite great achievements in the post-war period, we live in a world of persistent hunger amidst plenty.
 Presently, around 800 million people living in 46 countries are malnourished and 40,000 die every day of hunger and hunger-related diseases.
 Widespread famine currently threatens nine African countries, where the lives of 20 million people are at risk.
 Hunger and famine are usually associated with a physical shortage of food.
 Yet, even where food supplies are adequate, absence of opportunities for gainful employment to generate the purchasing power needed to buy food can result in hunger.
 Lack of food and employment are the basis for the poverty that still afflicts one-fifth of humankind.

He was usually a light sleeper and was very surprised that they had been able to get the drop on him.
 His guess was that the AElf maiden had cast some sort of spell on him to mask their approach, and he kept a close eye on her to make sure she did not repeat the effort.
 Of course she was also very nice to look at, so he did not need much of an excuse to enjoy the view.
 In the morning, he slowly pulled out some of the supplies and bundled them.
 He tried not to show how much he hurt.
 The wound might not kill him, but every movement hurt.
 He also handed Audrian a few of his coins.
 It wasn’t much, but it would get them started; they were lucky he was being so generous.
 Rodregas felt he owed them, and if he had been in their place he would have tried to kill Ravenhurr.

Public education programmes of this type are needed at the national and international level to disseminate information about chemical-free methods to producers and to educate consumers in developed and developing countries about both the health and environmental benefits of organically grown produce.
 9.Inland aquaculture.
 Depletion of deep sea fishery resources has resulted in a significant decline in world harvests from the sea.
 Proven technology is available for substantially replacing sea-grown fish with fresh or salt water pond-grown varieties.
 The new intensive and semi-intensive methods of cultivation can generate yields 10 to 100 times higher than traditional extensive methods.
 Due to the warmer climate and lower labour costs of the developing world, inland aquaculture can become a major stimulus to rural employment, incomes, processing industries and exports.
 10.Micro-level indicators of food security.
 Development initiatives have been severely limited by the absence of accurate and sensitive measures to assess the impact of national-level policies and programmes on food security at community and household level.
 New indices, such as the Sustain able Livelihood Security Index now under development in India, need to be evolved and applied; they should combine measures of income and employment; food and nutritional status, including the availability of safe drinking water and sanitation facilities; ownership of productive assets; and education and productive skills.

After a flirtatious flip of her hair, she started down the street.
 Aurelia froze, her blood as cold as when she had sensed the man in black.
 This time no magic could be blamed, and no sense of death.
 No, it was just the sight of Harruq, dressed in black armor and wielding ancient blades dripping with blood.
 Just the sight of him massacring an elven warrior.
 “Oh, Harruq,” she whispered.
 Then he saw her, and all time stopped.

She then sat back and put her hands to her forehead while the half-orc tried to remember where he was.
 “Can you find him?” Harruq asked her, realizing what she was doing.
 He sat on his rear and began readjusting his armor to his more slender frame.
 “In time,” she said.
 “I have met him only once, but I doubt there are any like him.
 Stay quiet and be patient.”
 Her mind was a net, and she cast it further and further out, scanning the rolling hills and the plains beyond.
 “Found him,” she whispered.

The elf glanced back, memorizing the exact direction the undead marched.
 “Clever, and disgusting,” he added.
 “Death is nothing but a recruitment tool for you.”
 Half an hour later, he and a hundred other elves riding atop pegasi followed the necromancer north.
 As they flew, they passed over a small campfire dotting the empty field below.
 Their passage above went unheard and unseen, for the two lone souls sitting on opposite sides of that campfire were deep in conversation.

I finished with the first third of the bottle, and then nodded.
 "I won't say anything.
 What exactly are we going to see?"
 "Not a what, but a who."
 Much like he'd done when we'd been fleeing from my house, Alec picked me up and then slung me around so I could wrap my legs around his waist, and my arms around his neck and chest.
 This time Alec wasn't sprinting, but he still set out at a pace that made conversation impossible, so I just relaxed into him and enjoyed being so close for a second time today.
 Once we stopped, I slid down Alec's back and looked around.
 The tiny cabin set back into the rocks before us blended into the hillside so well, I probably wouldn't have noticed it if Alec hadn't stopped so close.
 As soon as he was confident I could stand unaided, Alec gave me a reassuring smile, and then knocked gently on the door.
 The woman who appeared a few seconds later seemed frail in a way that somehow wasn't attributable to her graying hair, or slender frame.

Peace-building activities should address underlying economic and social factors that prevent the establishment of a stable and secure peace.
 In instances such as Cambodia, Rwanda and Somalia, the vacuum created by the complete collapse of political and economic institutions necessitates a broader role for the UN in re-establishing the peace.
 Peace building has thus far been defined as post-conflict actions to support reconstruction and to strengthen and solidify peace.
 The concept needs to be broadened to include pre-conflict actions and expanded to encompass a wider array of potentially destabilizing factors that lead to conflicts.
 The Commission supports the establishment of an International Centre jointly operated by the UN Security Council and UNESCO to implement peace-building programmes.
 Peace-building activities should be expanded to address security threats issuing from environmental degradation, poverty, migration of population and refugees.
 Many cases of ethnic conflict have an under lying basis of economic deprivation that must be addressed before tensions will permanently subside.
 Others can be mitigated by the introduction of positive economic incentives for cooperation.
 Economic cooperation is already dissipating ethnic tensions and conflict in the Middle East.
 It can be creatively fostered in the Balkans and elsewhere.

Doi’van is doing better than you, but I don’t think he is up to doing any visiting yet.” Rodregas nodded in relief at his words and soon enough he was once again sleeping.
 The next day, sometime around midmorning judging from the light coming in through the opening that seemed to function like a window, Imeralda entered along with a young handsome Nymph.
 He was tall with green hair and with a confident bearing to his presence.
 He greeted Rodregas with a very bright smile.
 “I see that you are looking much better,” said the unknown Nymph.
 Imeralda gave the young Nymph a big hug, one that looked far more intimate than Rodregas was comfortable with and she said, “Rodregas, we are so lucky that I was able to get Jordaan to come.
 Durien was working so hard trying to heal you, but your body is so hard to work with.
 He says that the same innate magical ability that makes your body so strong also requires a lot of power to heal.
 Normally Durien can heal even a very seriously wounded person, but he could barely keep you and Doi’van alive.

It opened its huge wings and launched itself into the air.

 We were gliding high up in the eerie sky and the view was actually beautiful.

I know they can hear me through the wire but I cannot hear them.
 Officer White tells me they have the male in custody as he was hiding the car in the apartment complex and he ran right into all of the marked police cars and attempted to run.
 The cops blocked him off with some unmarked cars that had been on him since his Dodge had slowed next to my truck.
 He tells me they are looking for the girl and ask me if I know anything about her whereabouts.
 I tell him where I last saw her and I add that her last call had an echo sound.
 I tell him that the back of that Starbucks is the bathroom so perhaps she is hiding in it.
 Other officers in the van hear my message as it is broadcast over my wire.
 They quickly get the information out and officers both under-cover and uniformed come out of the woodwork and rush around me towards the Starbucks.
 Officer White firmly tells me to “return to home-base now.” The officer’s phone hangs up suddenly.

“Where’s the fun in this?”
 “Here’s your fun,” one said, stabbing at Harruq’s side from behind.
 The blade punctured the black armor and bit into flesh.
 The half-orc roared, and then twisted so fast it left the expert guard breathless.
 His upper body jerked left to prevent the sword from going in any further.
 Salvation swung around, ringing against the blade.
 Condemnation followed through, aimed straight for the guard’s throat.
 He ducked underneath the swing, feeling the air of the cut just inches above his head.

“So you think you could kill all of us?

 Rodregas stepped forward and buried just the tip of his right-handed short sword into Audrian’s chest, hitting the ribs but not shoving the blade through.
 Audrian gasped in surprise and fell back.
 “Swear you will keep my secret and you live, do not and you die.
 Choose!” Audrian just stood there looking at him.
 Then he nodded and said, “In the name of the All-Father, Lord of Sky and Earth and Water, I swear that I will keep your secrets.” Rodregas nodded and relaxed slightly; few would dare break a promise to the All-Father.
 Rodregas decided that Brit and Geor were like pale shadows as they quickly followed suit.
 When he turned to the last two he saw that they were very interested in what he was saying.

Several books and strange containers ended up in the fire, though he did find two books that felt of magic that he kept.
 He also found a small statue of a strange green mechanical frog that had that magic tingle to it.
 He could not imagine its use; it appeared a simple toy, but he put it in his pile to take.
 There was a heavy oak cabinet in the corner which he forced open.
 Inside were large pottery containers, which he had seen before.
 They held some of the magic powders used to make the circles that were so important to many of the most powerful of the Immortalist’s spells.
 He checked the powders for magic and several came off very strong so he added them to the pile.
 Two came off with the foulest feel yet, even worse than the books in the studio.
 He could not burn them but knocked them into the middle of the room and then added a couple of the other non-magic powder containers.

With a quick movement of his arms and the haunting memory of the sounds of crunching and popping from all those years ago, he twisted Korin’s head nearly all the way around.
 Rodregas held his body as it spasmed wildly for a moment.
 Then the Adapt went still and limp; and Rodregas dropped him to the floor.
 Korin’s’ body hit the floor and started to empty itself.
 “Gods,” he thought and asked out loud to no one, “What did he eat this morning?” He grabbed the body and dragged it into the water closet and dropped it into the small bronze tub.
 Rodregas started to leave and then saw Korin’s purse; the Adapt was dressed for travel and Rodregas had yet to find even a single coin in the Master’s chambers.
 He reached down and took the purse off his belt.
 Rodregas opened it to find only a few silvers.
 He knew Korin should have more.

I felt him urge me forward, and my breath caught, heart stuttering into a broken lope.
 And then Ruby was beside us from out of nowhere, her words startling me back to the cold, dull room.
 “They’re coming in.” Chevelle leaned back, his fingers brushing my collarbone when he pulled away.
 I bit my lip at the tingle that ran through me, and the corner of his mouth turned up into a different kind of smile.
 He stood to walk from the room and I stared at the stone entry, struggling to keep my thoughts from spinning out of control.
 Too much had happened.
 Too much was wrong.
 My life had flipped, twisted into some strange reflection of itself, and I couldn’t reconcile the fragments.
 It caused me physical pain to think about Chevelle’s touch, about council, about what was happening, and I knew it was the bonds.
 When Grey walked out, my trance broke and I noticed Ruby by the front window, wearing an odd smile.

And it all seemed so paltry suddenly.

 My black period, my darkest days.

Marie Tranton, born 1904 .

 .
 It didn't tell the date of her death.
 That was odd--he was sure it had been in this section.
 His heart began racing as he scanned those pages.
 There was no mention at all of her death--or of her marriage.
 The only information was her date of birth, the names of her parents and brother, and the general family history.
 He knew that the other information had been there before, and after his mind had completely rejected the impossible--that the print had changed when Marie had stepped from 1927 into 2011 (another impossibility)--he rapidly considered the implications of such an impossibility.
 Maybe the information about the rest of her life wouldn't appear until she returned.

 He tried to run away, but she chased him.
 Thoroughly soaked, he changed tactics and ran toward her.

 He released her and then squirted her.
 Laughing again, Marie twirled in the spray.

I had two characters in my head, troubled half-orcs without home or family and whose decisions would one day bathe a world with war.
 To tell their story I had to start at the beginning, and the beginning is not kind.
 Reading some letters and reviews, I’ve seen just how dark I’ve gone.
 What you have just read is a slight alteration from my original manuscript.
 I have not changed the brothers’ actions.
 Instead, I have tried to show a bit more into their thoughts, their hearts, and their souls.
 I have had people call Harruq and Qurrah evil.
 Perhaps you agree.
 Much of what they have done certainly is evil.
 I will not sit here and justify the deaths of children, and to do so would paint me a psychopath and my characters sick beings.

Henry Swift and his best friend Bingo, who lands in a nursing home after a car wreck.
 He can’t speak or do much of anything except wheel his chair in widening circles.
 Whenever Henry encounters a crisis or challenge, he goes to Bingo and bares his soul but never gets an answer.
 Maybe on account of being an only child, ever since I can remember, I have longed for a best friend to whom I could tell all the crazy stuff I think and feel.
 A best friend is what I hoped Karen Flagstad could be.
 I used to think, with someone who could know my secrets and also douse the fire in me and thereby keep me from all the nonsense men do on account of women, I could live content and free.
 I won’t argue the chicken and egg question, does our desire for intimacy rise out of our need for God, or is our belief in God the desperate attempt to satisfy that inborn desire for intimacy.
 But I’m placing my bets on the former, the need for God answer.
 Which is why, on this road trip, I find myself hopeful to the point of desperation that, taking a cue from Brother Lawrence, I can learn to adore God enough so that he will become my daily companion, whom I count on and trust with my failings and secrets.
 Suddenly, maybe invited by all the remembering, a whole other wave of thought takes hold of me.

 Britney shrugged with the supreme indifference of someone whose world extended only a few feet beyond their immediate person.
 "Just don't get me sick if you do.
 Ashure Day isn't that far away."
 We were halfway to the tutoring lab, and the halls were nearly empty.
 Everyone was always in such a hurry to get out, to go home, or to a party.

 She turned and threw her arms around him.
 She was in a party scene, one of six people that formed a group with the star.
 She wasn't supposed to do anything but smile and sip her drink, but when the star gave her a smoldering glance during rehearsal, the director decided he wanted to film it.
 The result was a split-second close-up of her face, and the star kissed her hand.
 Marie felt as if she were going to burst from excitement.
 They were allowed to watch filming until lunch, and then they were given a tour of the rest of the studio.
 Marie heard obscenities and shouting, and she saw two different actors storm off two different sets in the middle of their scenes.

Instead, Alec had stumbled over, shifted back to human form, and got the bleeding slowed to a point where I wasn't in imminent danger of death.
 Unfortunately that'd been all the delay Brandon's pack had needed to make a run for it.
 Isaac, James and Jasmin were trying to track down the worst of the lot, the ones who'd taken an active part in Brandon's atrocities, but it was slow going.
 Part of the job had been resolved when Cassie and two other wolves had tried to circle around and attack the estate.
 Luckily Isaac and the others had stumbled onto them.
 The fight had been brief and bloody.
 None of our guys had escaped unharmed, but they were all going to make a full recovery, and the same couldn't be said for Cassie or the others.
 I shivered a little at the thought, and Alec looked up with concern on his face.

With a quick stab into his groin, Rodregas took the slaver out of commission.
 Rodregas rolled off his squirming body and threw himself up to a standing position.
 He almost immediately went down again as his wounded thigh buckled under him.
 Rodregas saw the Immortal Guard who had stabbed him, a stocky man with large arms.
 He was coming in carefully, shield up, sword in position.
 Rodregas made up his mind not to underestimate him despite being severely wounded.
 Rodregas struggled back up and spread his feet wide for balance and locked his legs straight to try to keep them from buckling under him.
 He felt cold and knew he was losing blood fast.
 Rodregas knew that this was probably it.

About half way through the fall semester, President Kennedy got bushwhacked.
 I was so used to good people dying, I didn’t take it as hard as some did.
 College was okay, except I came to doubt I wanted to major in Philosophy when I learned the classes were less concerned with the ideas than with arguing about them.
 And as finals approached, Laura Steinhoff's boyfriend Frank Holmes stopped by our apartment and pitched us a better idea.
 Better especially for me whose sole living hero was Jack Kerouac.
 Frank wanted to take off driving and stop in New Orleans for Mardi Gras.
 After that, we could just point the car north or east and go.
 So Bob and I dropped out of college after one semester, even though we risked getting drafted and sent to war.
 We pooled our money, bought an old Chevy, and pulled on to Highway 80.
 By New Orleans, we were low on money, and after one night in that town where we eighteen-year-olds could legally drink, we were broke.

 And then she brought them dinner!
 It wasn't very good, but Rick said that they could get some pizza as soon as they got to Hollywood.
 At the airport they got their luggage and rented a car.
 Marie looked around eagerly as Rick drove to the hotel, but so far it didn't look much different from 2011 Boston.
 "Where are the studios we'll be touring?"

My big kids are great, and I mean great in the most literal sense.
 Darcy, the artist who could draw better at three years old than I could when she was three and I was thirty three, majored in painting and photography in college and graduated then worked as a newspaper designer but soon turned to teaching.
 She teaches fifth grade kids so underprivileged that not one in her last year’s class of twenty-seven had ever participated in an organized sport.
 She loves the kids, so she’s always developing some new method, like creating a bi-weekly newspaper and having them write columns on their favorite subjects or assigning them to design their dream house and using the assignment to teach basic geometry.
 In summer, at the Boy’s and Girl’s Club, she teaches art to teenagers, most of them troubled or in trouble.
 Darcy’s great because her giant’s heart is open and she uses her brains and imagination in generous ways.
 And Cody’s one of those most-rare people who have all the tools.
 He’s strong, smart, industrious, and even handsomer than his dad.
 He’ll graduate with a B.A.

Then he was up, both hands gripping his sword tightly.
 Harruq came charging in, both swords striking.
 The guard parried one after the other, constantly retreating.
 The others came to his aid, swinging careful, tentative blows.
 All three tried to engage without being put at risk, much like men prodding a bull.
 Of course, the result was similar.
 The bull got madder.
 “If you’re gonna fight me, fight me!” he yelled.
 He ignored several strikes, accepting the cuts so he could close the distance between him and his opponent.
 The sound of steel was quick and brutal, but after the humiliation against Dieredon, Harruq felt as if his opponent moved through sand.

 In Spanish, Mrs. Tiggs took special delight in telling us that she'd started grading our tests and a couple of them weren't looking very good.
 I suffered through the last hour of school and then hurried to my locker.
 I didn't really want to meet up with Britney, but I also didn't want to alienate her any more than I already had.
 I shouldn't have even bothered.
 I waited around for a full fifteen minutes before finally heading over to the tutoring lab.
 Britney was watching the door when I arrived.
 She didn't even bother trying to mask the flash of satisfaction that crossed her face when I walked in late, obviously having spent the last little while waiting for her.
 I wanted to scream, or maybe cry.

“They have retreated.
 They were able to briefly incapacitate the wolves, giving Rhys and Rider less warning of their approach before you were attacked.” He hesitated.
 “When we heard the alert, I turned.
 Your eyes were closed.” I didn’t comment, so he continued, “I was able to catch you just before your horse dropped.
 I’ve no idea why they attacked him.
 They should have been focused on you.” I wasn’t sure they had attacked the horse.
 Maybe it was because I’d been there, in his mind, controlling him.

Alec's tone was still conversational as he shoved Vincent backwards and allowed his hand to return to normal.
 "The harassment of my people stops now."
 "Now why would we do a thing like that when we all know you're a dead man?"
 Dominic stopped just outside of what I was starting to understand was pouncing range for people who happened to have supernatural strength, as Alec gave Brandon a cold smile.
 "If I ever really decide the outcome is a foregone conclusion, you'd better start watching out for your people.
 You'd be surprised just how many of them could disappear if I no longer worried about the consequences of my actions."
 The tingle of Alec's power lessened slightly once we were out of sight, but it still hadn't dropped off completely by the time we were standing in front of Mrs. Tiggs' classroom.
 I could still feel the faintest traces of his power long after he'd finally let my hand go with obvious reluctance and strode off, leaving Dominic and I to find our seats.

 However, that child was born in 1936, so it is highly unlikely that she had a terminal infection for five years.
 Rumors at the time suggested that her husband had transmitted a venereal disease to her."
 Rick was shocked.
 He had a hard time picturing the young woman in the picture as a victim.
 Of course, even today women stayed with men who abused them, and it would have been much harder for a woman in the 1920s to escape.
 But why had she married him?
 Had she not seen what type of man he was?

I couldn't help trying to catch another glimpse of the art class as I walked past.
 I'd been hoping to see Alec again, but hadn't expected him to look up as I craned my neck to see inside.
 I stumbled a little in surprise.
 He was still gorgeous, but the simple joy was gone.
 He no longer looked like something that couldn't exist in this world, but even with anger etched on his features my heart still skipped a beat.
 I ducked around the corner and started down the stairs, my embarrassment at being caught staring giving way to anger.
 It didn't make any sense.
 I'd never done anything to him.
 Did he really hate me so much just because I'd told him off about not protecting Rachel?

 He seemed to go back to say-a-few-words-and-then-say-nothing-which-drives-everyone-crazy.
 Emily made a face at him.
 “Wow, thanks so much for the support, Jason.

He kissed her then, but she found the pleasure too painful to bear and ended the kiss, pressing her face into his shoulder as she cried.
 His declaration that he wanted to marry her had torn her apart.

 She had a home, a mother and father and brother and friends .

But for now, my thoughts drift back to Eric.
 I have tried, on this trip, to relive our whole two years of brotherhood.
 And now I reconsider the fact that he didn’t die the moment his head rammed the boulder.
 He lived for a day, during which we got confronted with the possibility that drove my story “Cars”, that he might live another sixty years without the use of his marvelous brain.
 Or, a miracle might bring him back to life.
 A whole new question arises.
 What if, while Eric lay comatose, he was given once more the choice to live, as I'm coming to believe he was given the choice before leaving for the desert in Kenny’s mom’s Volkswagen?
 If Kenny were still alive, I would ask him to describe, as best his memory would serve him, Eric’s expression and voice when he insisted they leave without Billy and me.
 The Bible implies that Jesus, had he been a less than perfect, could have chosen another fate than crucifixion.
 Only he chose trust his father’s will above his own, which was limited by his humanity, as ours is, in spades.

Every nagging doubt, every tiny part screaming for him to sheath his blades, he channeled into his mindless rage.
 His swords hacked chunks out of the staff, which held together only by Aurelia’s powerful enchantments.

He did not have the angle to grab his opponent’s throat.
 Instead he had to grab the man’s lower face which was exposed by the half helm, and then he squeezed.
 Rodregas felt the guard’s face give way to his rage and unnatural strength.
 For a moment the guard struggled to escape his hold, but Rodregas pulled him closer with one hand and with the other ripped his opponent’s face away.
 Rodregas felt a stab in his back as he took either an arrow or a sword.
 He was groggy with pain, and both weak and filled with rage.
 The guard in his hands was thrashing and spasming in unspeakable pain.
 As the guard collapsed to the ground, Rodregas fell with him.
 He tried to once more roll to the side, struggling away from a potential final stroke.

Technological development propels a spiral of economic development that creates many more jobs than it destroys.
 The most striking testimony to this fact is the history of employment in USA, arguably the country that has most readily and fully adopted new technologies over the past century.
 Employment in manufacturing and mining grew to a peak of about 40 per cent of the workforce after World War II before beginning its downward spiral to 15 per cent by 2000, about the same proportion as in 1850.
 Yet, during this same period total employment in America has expanded phenomenally, from a mere 13 million workers in 1870 to 68 million in 1955 and more than 136 million in 2002.
 In spite of all the automation and all the export of jobs to lower wage economies, the percentage of the American population employed has continued to rise over time.
 Several factors are responsible for this result, among which population growth and technological development are most prominent.
 Rising levels of technological sophistication certainly displace workers in most fields of manufacturing.
 But at the same time they stimulate growth of employment in many different ways – increasing demand for the products thus manufactured by a factor of 10, 100 or even 1000 fold as in the case of automobiles, TVs, cell phones and computers; increasing the demand for research workers to support technological innovation and for teachers to meet the rising demand for education; and rising living standards, which increases consumption of other goods and services due to the falling prices made possible by rising productivity.
 Over the past two decades the US economy lost nearly 4 million manufacturing jobs but added a net 37 million jobs through expansion of the service sector, which now accounts for 84 per cent of total employment.
 It is time that we stop resisting or resenting this trend, but rather strive to adapt by shifting our focus toward those fields of employment which are most directly stimulated by technological innovation.

Much like he'd done when we'd been fleeing from my house, Alec picked me up and then slung me around so I could wrap my legs around his waist, and my arms around his neck and chest.
 This time Alec wasn't sprinting, but he still set out at a pace that made conversation impossible, so I just relaxed into him and enjoyed being so close for a second time today.
 Once we stopped, I slid down Alec's back and looked around.
 The tiny cabin set back into the rocks before us blended into the hillside so well, I probably wouldn't have noticed it if Alec hadn't stopped so close.
 As soon as he was confident I could stand unaided, Alec gave me a reassuring smile, and then knocked gently on the door.
 The woman who appeared a few seconds later seemed frail in a way that somehow wasn't attributable to her graying hair, or slender frame.
 It wasn't until she released Alec from a hug, and slowly moved back into the cabin, that I realized it was how she moved that made her seem so old.
 Her motions reminded me of how my grandfather had moved the last few years before he'd died.
 Slowly, and with extra care, as if a careless action would leave him crumpled on the floor, racked with pain.

I could see no other option.
 No one came.
 I wasn’t fool enough to go back voluntarily, but for some reason, they hadn’t followed.
 I didn’t know what to do with myself.
 I had nothing outside of home, outside of the village.
 I didn’t even know where to go, didn’t know where I was.
 It was just another clearing outside of the only town I’d ever known, the only town I remembered knowing.

There probably wasn't anyone in the school who knew less about fighting than me.
 I knew I should turn around and run away before Cassie realized I was serious, but somehow I didn't care.
 Cassie's arsenal of nasty tricks wouldn't be so effective against someone who'd already been kicked out of their house and moved to another state.
 All I really needed to do was survive the next few minutes.
 I'd be out of the state before she really got busy making my life miserable.
 A dozen different things I could say blew through my mind, but they were all competing, and none of them fit the situation.
 In typical fashion, I found myself without anything clever to say.
 Instead I just stood there and stared at Cassie.
 I'd thought things were tense already, but where everyone had been quiet before, now they were motionless too.
 Cassie spun around and glared at me.

The men had patches of hair curled on their chests and forearms and some even grew it around their chins like goats.
 Their clothes were tattered and ill-fitting rags.
 They moved about the camp slowly.
 Clearly they had no magic, and they definitely were the owners of the crude tools we had found.
 They spoke to each other often, their voices like the protest of an old hound.
 I watched until nightfall, when they settled into tents and lean-tos.
 They seemed to assign a watchman, wielding only a torch lit from the central fire.

Chevelle was by the fire, preparing to roast the birds.
 Steed stood beside his horse, adjusting the saddle’s straps.
 Both had their backs turned to me as if they’d not even noticed.
 A wave of vertigo hit when I tried to speak and I fell back against the tree limb to steady myself.
 It seemed only a moment, but when my eyes opened again the scene had changed.
 Steed reclined beside me, elbow resting on a bent knee as he lazily wound a feather in his hand.
 Chevelle was across the fire.
 He looked up at me through his lashes, past his furrowed brow, and then brought me a piece of meat.
 It was cold.

Dealing with blinding agony hadn't ever been my strong point.
 I opened my mouth to scream, only to find that no sound would come out.
 The world was still spinning, but I was oriented just enough to realize that Dominic had her hand over my mouth and nose.
 I pulled at her arm, but the effort was completely futile.
 Rising panic over not being able to breathe made me hammer at the iron bar pressing me against her, but she never looked away from whatever had captured her concentration.
 Rachel suddenly appeared off to my right, and she put her finger to her lips, and then sank all ten fingernails into Dominic's arm.
 The sudden absence of the support I'd been unconsciously using to keep weight off of my right foot resulted in tear-jerking pain as the damaged appendage touched down, but I gritted my teeth and managed to keep it down to a hiss.
 Rachel draped my arm over her shoulders, and then dragged me forward a couple of awkward, hopping steps.
 A couple of heartbeats passed before I realized the pool of shadow before us was Jessica.
 She had her eyes closed and was rocking back and forth as Rachel carefully pulled her to us.

Eventually, I found the best defense was to block the attacks by deflecting them with other objects.
 His magic was too powerful to counter directly and he’d prevented me from ducking away.
 When I was blocking about half the strikes successfully, he pocketed the stone and progressed with sticks, water, fire, anything he found on the trail.
 We were still riding too fast and I was exhausted from the mental and physical exertion when he switched to full-body attacks.
 By nightfall I wasn’t able to fend off anything that came at me and he mercifully stopped the horses beneath another hollow in the mountain.
 I was asleep practically before I slid off my horse.
 The next morning I woke to the sound of rock against rock.
 There was no sign of Chevelle or his horse in the dim stone hollow.
 I sat up, rubbing my sore legs, unable to believe he’d left me.

If I didn’t succeed, I wouldn’t survive!
 Somewhere around this time, I decided to try and find my biological father, Richard, a natural thing for a young man my age to want to do, right?
 So I tracked him down and called him.
 Richard was living in Arkansas and had been for many years.
 We talked on the phone and upon discovering he would be near our homes on a business trip, arranged a meeting at a hotel—with Thomas too.
 Thomas begged out at the last minute, and without contacting Richard I brought my friend Bill with me for the drive into the bay area.
 When I knocked on the door of the hotel room, my father opened the door looked at me, called me Thomas, and then he looked at Bill and called him by my name.
 He didn’t even know what his own kids looked like.
 We spent a brief time in the hotel room getting our names and heritage correct then we were off to dinner.
 During the dinner, Richard asked if I could “score some toot” which I discovered meant find cocaine.

“And do you have a full suit of Night Bronze Plate Mail for me and a magic sword or three as well?” he asked in his careful voice.
 “I am afraid that if we want any proper armor for ourselves we are going to have to take it off some Immortal Guard’s corpse.
 But I do have one other Black Yew bow and a bigger sword that probably makes more sense for you to use than me, since I have used nothing but short swords for a very long time.” Rodregas then pulled out the two-handed great sword that he had found at the keep and handed it to Doi’van.
 On Doi’van it was more a hand and a half sword, but as he flourished it around a bit, Rodregas could see he was pleased.
 “The steel is simple, but the balance is good.
 I am starting to be very happy that I helped pull this wagon up the hill,” he said with a deep chuckle, which sounded like distant thunder.
 Rodregas nodded and said, “I am afraid other than a few items to sell everything else is food and blankets for us... and the horses and tools that I stripped out of the Raven Keep.
 I figured I would need the tools to fix this place up and make it livable.” Rodregas continued, “It is dark and late.

The face that'd look back out of the glass would look almost more like hers than mine.
 Shoulder-length blond hair and blue eyes still seemed to be all the rage, but mine were ruined by pale skin that burned instead of tanning, and a build that had retained its baby fat long after most of the other girls had started slimming down.
 Those extra inches had evaporated recently, but of course it couldn't be a cause for celebration.
 When Mom surfaced enough to notice how much weight I'd lost, she worried I was developing an eating disorder.
 She couldn't seem to understand that I hated the new me more than she did.

 I'd tried to make myself eat enough to fill back out, but I'd had a hard time remembering meals lately.
 It was easier to just cinch my pants up a little and avoid mirrors.
 Even when I did remember, the calories in didn't seem quite able to keep up with the calories my body routinely burned up.

We had talked about my playing Berger.
 But, it didn’t happen, so…
 CM:  	You were gonna be in Hair?
 BG: 	Well, I don’t know, we were just talking.
 I don’t think he’d quite settled yet, on his approach, the whole tribal thing.
 I mean, it was a student thing, mostly, and he did these intense tribal unity things before he ever started rehearsing the play.
 It was beautiful.
 I was part of some of the early planning.
 Mostly it was just talk.
 I’d sit in, we’d all be in a room and we’d just chant for an hour or so.

It was a species I didn't recognize, but it still called to me.
 For a second I could almost hear a familiar voice whispering in my ear.
 "Come on, Adri.
 Cindi's already climbed up to the second set of branches.
 You can do it, but you don't have to do it all by yourself, let me help you."
 My vision was growing blurry.
 I tried to wrench my thoughts back to safe territory, but it was too late, Dad's face was already filling up my vision.
 Cindi and I looked nothing like Mom.
 She was all dark, wavy hair, olive skin and at five-three hadn't been able to kiss Dad unless he bent down.
 Dad was the one who gave us the blond hair and a shot at maybe hitting an average height.

“They killed my wife!
 You have to…”
 Their words trailed off once they were close enough to see clearly.
 Flesh hung from their bones, pale and rotting.
 Wounds spotted nearly every one, although no blood poured from them.
 Their saviors were men, orc, and elf, but they were dead.
 “Ashhur help us,” an exhausted farmer murmured before the line advanced upon them.

My grandfather was a very volatile person, a hateful man, and he clashed with his son—my Uncle Dan—often.
 They physically fought, and my uncle was no match for his father.
 My grandfather, a retired oil driller from Oklahoma and Kansas, drank a lot.
 His skin was Indian-dark, and the wrinkles on his face were deep.
 My brother and I would hide when they fought, and my mother would hold us if she was there, placing her hands over our ears and cradling us close to her.
 Her body muffled the sounds.
 She would rock slightly while humming or singing quietly so we would drift off to anyplace but there.
 We stayed because we had no place else to go, just as my uncle and my grandmother did.
 My grandmother was a stark contrast to my grandfather.

We hid under a pool table and talked about Eric and our dubious futures.
 Karen didn't care to join us for yet another party at Black's Beach, a place only accessible by a trail down a high sea cliff, where police never showed to bust rowdy kids for drinking.
 So around dawn, I rode shotgun while Cliff drove and Lucas Field and Carol Stuhr napped in back.
 We were on Murphy Canyon Road, a two-lane without sidewalks or curbs, bordered by vacant, hilly land.
 I dosed off.
 Then Cliff joined the rest of us.
 The parked station wagon we rammed might've saved our lives, as it kept the convertible from running up the side of a bank and flipping onto our heads.
 The station wagon was wrecked, Bob's Ford was totaled, and the four of us got cited on account of the case of beer in the trunk, which was meant for the beach party.
 Maybe in consideration of it being our prom-night, the police dropped charges on the condition that Cliff agreed to pay off the station wagon owner.
 I offered to split the pay off.

 “It is behind that door we have not opened up yet, but it smells of the Infernal Realm,” Doi’van said nodding over to the other exposed door.
 “What door?

 “What?” Rodregas exclaimed.
 “You don’t see that door?” Doi’van and he shared a look of confusion.

In the early stages of reform, the public exhibited an incredible degree of patience, tolerance and endurance under conditions of growing hardship.
 Gradually public resentment and personal suffering (especially for the aged, children and new entrants to the work force) became so severe in some countries that no government could have sustained the programme without facing political upheaval or violent revolution.
 There is some truth in the argument that ‘shock therapy’ did not fail in Russia and other countries, because it was never actually implemented.
 At each crucial juncture either the central bank or the government pulled back from enforcing the necessary fiscal discipline.
 But it is equally true that ‘shock therapy’ never could have been implemented by a democratic government, when it imposed such enormous hardship on the people and generated a polarization and fragmentation of political forces within the country.
 Where similar strategies have succeeded in other parts of the world, it has usually been under authoritarian governments, such as in Chile.
 Where force is not possible, the only viable alternative is to build social consensus in support of the reform strategy.
 Ultimately, the success of the reform measures will be determined by one factor – the extent to which the people understand, accept and are motivated to act under the new system.
 Before introducing any new measure, maximum effort should be made to communicate its purpose and nature to the people and win their understanding and approval.
 Public education is the most powerful policy instrument.

The officers are sent to stake out a nearby drugstore.
 My story to the drug dealers will be that I will fill the prescription there and meet her in that parking lot as it is a stone’s throw within the county line which they want the bust in.
 One problem I point out is that the drugstore will be closed in a few minutes but they send the crew that direction for feedback on the location.
 The call comes back and the parking lot is virtually empty of cars leaving no cover for the officers to hide.
 I am starting to feel like I know more about this drug busting business than the cops.
 After a change of venue to a nearby grocery store down the street and several miles within the county line, it is nearly 9 pm and I have been unable to call my wife for over three hours.
 The officers move into place for the bust.
 Several marked police cars hide in an adjacent apartment complex that has a driveway into the grocery store parking lot at the opposite end of the shopping center.
 I am instructed to park my truck’s front end against a fence that borders the parking lot facing the greenbelt.
 I am shown new surveillance photos of the two suspects and their vehicle: a red Dodge Charger with tinted windows.

Alec just continued on, never seeming to really hurry, never actually making a mistake, but still grinding through calculations with a speed I might have been able to match on a good day, but couldn't even approach today.
 It would've been much easier to just stop my efforts and watch him work, but I was too stubborn to give up.
 Alec finished up with the theoretical portion of the assignment, and started stringing the pulleys while most of the other groups were still arguing over whether or not they could afford to add a few extra grams for extra credit.
 If there was a single person in the class who didn't need any extra credit, it was Alec; but he calmly loaded the system with an extra sixteen grams, caught Mrs. Alexander's eye, and then smoothly started the train of weights moving up the ramp, over the wall, through the woods, and right up to Grandma's house.
 It wasn't fair that someone who missed so many days of school could be so consistently right.
 He must have an IQ of 160.
 That and an ego big enough for someone twice as smart.

 Instead her eyes seemed to warn me never to go out alone at night because if she ever found me somewhere without any witnesses, they were going to have to hospitalize me.
 I felt a chill run through me, and dropped my eyes out of involuntary reflex.
 I probably would've started shaking if someone hadn't grabbed my shoulder and startled some kind of twisted cross between a shriek and a gasp out of me.
 I turned to give whoever it was a piece of my mind, but Brandon's laughing gray eyes made the words tangle up before they made it down to my tongue.

The tiny form following after him looked like a fragile schooner trailing along the edge of a hurricane.
 The room seemed so calm after James disappeared that for a second I forgot Jessica was still half-crouched in the center of the room.
 Alec hadn't forgotten, and if the waves of tension and energy rolling off of him weren't as strong as the combined effects coming from all four of them, it still felt like the walls should explode outwards.
 Jessica seemed to shrink in on herself, and then she turned and ran away with a final hiss of defiance.
 Isaac looked up at Alec from the corner where he'd been quietly standing.
 Alec's almost imperceptible nod sent him in the same direction as Jessica.
 Whatever meager survival instincts I had left chose that moment to finally kick in, and I felt my knees begin to give way.
 Rachel let out a high-pitched sound that had all of the surprise of a squeal, but none of the excitement.

I followed everyone else out to the bus, but there wasn't any refuge there.
 I was just too different from everyone else.
 Hour after hour passed in silent misery, until finally the rest of the kids wore themselves out and it quieted down enough for me to lapse into a fitful sleep.
 I was smack-dab in the middle of a dream about Rachel and Britney when everything changed.
 Ever so slowly, the normal dreamscape took on a sharp-edged glow, and then morphed into the breathtaking colors that'd wormed their way even deeper into my heart than I'd realized.
 I didn't recognize my surroundings, but they were different than any of the places I'd been before.
 The new scents whipping past me on the breeze were sign enough even if I hadn't been able to detect the subtle differences in the light emanating off of the foliage paving the trail I was walking along.
 For the length of the dream I lost myself in the wonder of experiencing the world in all of its amazing depth.
 Still, even the pure delight in my surroundings wasn't enough to mute the feeling something was missing.

 The whole purpose of this little exercise is to convince your mom you've been safely home this entire time.

 "Maybe if you stayed with me it would help me sleep."
 I almost couldn't believe those words were really coming out of my mouth.
 I wanted to blame it on how close he was standing, or how tired I was, or anything else that might be remotely believable, but based on how serious his face had just become, it was too late to take it all back.
 "That doesn't strike me as being a much better solution."

Brandon approached the vehicle with enthusiasm and the brightest broadest smile we have ever seen on his face.
 We instantly noticed his weight gain and he proudly announced through our open car window that he was nearing 170 pounds, and he looked healthy for the first time in so many years.
 His complexion was clear and his eyes were the bright blue they once were and the whites of his eyes were shinny and clear.
 Brandon could hardly wait for us to open the car door and he embraced each of us as if he hadn’t seen us in years.
 I know I hadn’t seen him like this in years.
 He held me so tightly and so long.
 He hadn’t hugged me like that since he was a young child.

A half-hour into the trip we all, even Steve, regretted bringing Tom.
 All the way over the mountains, he had criticized us, for opening a window, calling for a pit stop, and choosing the wrong direction at a crossroads.
 In the desert he turned into a pyromaniac, pelted us with fiery sticks and blew one of our sleeping bags to shreds with cherry bombs.
 At last, a few of us chased him off into the night.
 In the morning, we couldn’t find the long crowbar we had brought for loosing boulders so we could roll them and watch them crash down the hillsides.
 We supposed Tom had stolen the crowbar and sold it to another camper then bummed a ride home.
 That Sunday morning, on the biggest and flattest of all the canyon’s boulders, Eric stood as though at a pulpit, arms outstretched as in the “Jesus body picture” while he consulted our copy of Zarathustra and recited, “’Man is something that shall be overcome.
 You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm.

So, I sit on my porch and dream myself back to the morning when Cliff and I woke up in a Tijuana riverbed.
 Instead of what happened, I tell Cliff I’m going on the road to find Kerouac.
 Then I drive Route 66 and the turnpike from Chicago, 3000 miles to the Left Bank Bar in Lindenhurst, Long Island, where Bobby Casso introduces Jack and me.
 We talk about everything, including God and tequila, and at the right moment, I tell him about the light.
 His eyes open wider.
 Still in my dream, I'm back home when a postcard arrives, from Jack, who writes that he’s gone and found his daughter, Jan, who would otherwise also die young, and they’re going to live in peace, joy, and love, now and for eternity.
 And they might help save Neal Cassady.

 While going through my boxes of Eric’s treasures, I find myself hoping that somehow God, in eternity, will bless Sylvia in spite of her meanness.

When we were kids, he found a little mouse.
 It was dead as dead can be.
 He closed his hands around it, just like this, and then whispered some words he learned from secretly watching Master.”
 “Master?” Aurelia asked, interrupting him again.
 “Yeah,” Harruq said, frowning.
 “My brother didn’t have too much fun before I found him.
 We were both sold, but I escaped.
 Qurrah, though, he was sold to Master…‌forget it, that’s for another time.
 All that matters is that he learned those words before he met me.

The nickname should have hurt, but somehow it wasn't as bad when the pack used it.
 It was almost like having a new family, one without all of the grief-poisoned memories that popped up every time I really thought about Dad or Cindi.
 Faster than I would've believed possible, we were all in our dresses, and waiting in the living room for the boys to make their appearance.
 Jasmin and Rachel had worked what I was pretty sure was actual magic.
 Even Jessica was nothing less than stunning, and I didn't look as bad as normal.
 Jasmin's backless black dress and shoulder-length gloves had streaks of blue that brought out her eyes, while Dominic's tight, red gown seemed to give her the confidence and poise you'd expect from someone so gorgeous and utterly exotic.
 Jess had opted for a sleeveless silver number that flared out at the bottom so much I wasn't sure how Isaac would be able to walk next to her without stepping on the shimmery material.
 Rachel's mauve dress was probably the most conservative of all, neither over-snug, nor especially low-cut.
 It had seemed entirely out of character considering what she'd purchased for the rest of us, but when I'd asked, she'd just grimaced and said Alec would've made her stay home if she'd chosen anything more daring.
 None of which helped me feel any more comfortable in the tight, strapless wonder Rachel had been so excited to give me.

As Jordaan relaxed his grip and released him, Rodregas shook his arm and then his body, trying to feel the difference.
 It felt almost like someone had drawn all over him from the inside, but there was no visible difference.
 There was no sign that a bit of his magic had been used up in the creation of a permanent effect.
 Rodregas sat and watched as Doi’van and then Imeralda undertook the inscription of the minor sigil.
 From Rodregas’ perspective the next two seemed to withstand the pain a lot better than then he had.
 After all three were completed Imeralda used her magic to inscribe Jordaan.
 The healing sigil was the only sigil commonly used by magic users.
 A few were known to use sigils that improved memory or allowed one to store excess magic.
 After the sensation faded Rodregas felt no different than before.
 Rodregas had the feeling that Jordaan would have liked to keep the little frog; it was a powerful tool in the hands of an Elemental Healer like Jordaan, but Rodregas was not willing to give it up, and Jordaan never actually asked.

It is true that the UN stands for diversity and pluralism, but not when it comes to freedom and human rights.
 True pluralism and diversity can only be exercised and enjoyed by people in freedom.
 Recognizing the considerable effort that will be needed to prepare still subject people and to train national leaders in democratic institutions and processes, all possible support should be extended by the international community to make available the knowledge and skills needed to build viable political institutions.
 The UN should establish a graded, time-bound programme for the transformation of authoritarian states.
 Should the people of any country themselves prefer an alternative system, let them freely make that choice by electoral process.
 Suspension of voting rights or of the privileges of membership should be the ultimate penalty for the failure of governments to comply with this condition within a reasonable period of time.
 The affirmation of democratic principles cannot and will not stop with the domestic governance of member countries.
 It is inevitable that the same principles be extended to the relationships between the nations that make up the international community.
 The present structure of the UN system is a product of the Second World War, just as the League of Nations was of the First.
 The Allied powers conceived it at the height of the war and evolved its structure to reflect the immediate post-war realities.

It clicked off and I gazed outside one more time before turning around to go to bed.
 “Night Emily.” I yawned.

 “What is it, Em?” I whispered, a nervous feeling creeping into my stomach.

So, why would Buddy turn his back on the band after that triumph?
 There are as many theories as theorists.
 Buddy wanted success, bigger success.
 He tasted perfection with Turntable Poison but it was local perfection.
 The album, though notorious today, an insider’s treasure trove, a collector’s grail, did not sell outside of Memphis.
 No major label bought the rights to it.
 Still, even this late, one wishes, with the advent of the compact disc revolution, that it would be reissued.

Each generation welcomes with foreboding the advent of new technologies, attracted by their potential benefits and frightened by the immediate costs they impose.
 But contrary to popular conception and empirical observation, there is little evidence to support the thesis that technological development is responsible for rising levels of unemployment in the medium to long term.
 In spite of widespread anxiety that machines are progressively replacing people in the workforce, historically there has been a strong positive correlation between technological development and job creation.
 It is certainly the case that the commercial application of each new phase of productive technologies displaces people from traditional occupations, reduces the number of workers required to carry out specific tasks, and can in the short term lead to fewer jobs in specific industries.
 In the process, a larger number of low-wage, unskilled jobs are replaced with a smaller number of higher-wage, more skilled jobs resulting in rising levels of worker productivity and rising personal incomes.
 But that is only the most direct initial impact of improved technology.
 Seen from a wider perspective and traced patiently along the course of its myriad consequences, the introduction of new technology acts as a catalyst that generates a positive ripple effect which, on average, results in the creation of many more jobs – more skilled, more productive and higher-wage jobs – than it destroys.
 The rising productivity made possible by technology reduces production costs and thereby lowers the price of products and services to customers and consumers.
 The lower prices result in increased demand, greater consumption, higher levels of production and even greater cost reductions due to economies of scale.
 This represents only the first cycle of job creation.

 Donovan released my arm as she reared up and placed her front paws on my shoulders.
 The colorless eyes didn't match any of the pack's human form, but they had Dominic's gentleness.
 She dropped back down and butted her head against my hand.
 I started petting her out of reflex, but when I slowed down out of embarrassment, she butted my hand again.
 After a few seconds she turned and slipped away, disappearing into the trees in a matter of seconds.
 The rest of the pack waited expectantly, milling about partially hidden by Alec's towering figure.

I mean to test his argument, because I’m stuck on the word “adore.” Here’s how it happened: in the midst of a period of personal, family, and professional turmoil, I picked up The Practice of the Presence of God, by Brother Lawrence, and discovered that simply reading about this fellow from long ago delivers some peace.
 Not perfect peace, but closer than before.
 Close enough so that friends find my apparent serenity in the midst of turmoil worth remarking about.
 Brother Lawrence was a layman who lived and worked, mostly in the kitchen, at a monastery in sixteenth century France.
 I thank God for the book by and about him.
 Still, it leaves me with nagging questions and a suspicion that I may have missed the point.
 In letters of encouragement and through the example of his life as described by admirers, Brother Lawrence proposed that the most blessed existence was to live in the awareness that God is always in our presence, and to act accordingly.
 Don't ignore him.
 Talk, listen, and worship him.
 Brother Lawrence’s attitude troubles me, because he persistently challenges his readers to follow his example, to live in, and for, daily, hourly, continuous communion with God.

The role of the UNESCO Commission on Culture and Development can make a valuable contribution to our understanding of this most important issue.
 Strategies for Developing Human Resourcefulness
 The following strategies can be carried out by both govern mental and non-governmental agencies at the national and international level to achieve the goals set forth in this report:
 International level
 1.Shift resources from defence to human resource development: Worldwide, massive investment is needed to improve the quantity and quality of education and training.
 A substantial portion of these resources will have to come from reduced military spending.
 But as recent experience illustrates, savings in defence spending will not automatically go to this sector.
 The UN Social Summit should adopt specific goals for reducing military expenditure worldwide and channelling a specific percentage of the savings into education, vocational training, public information and other programmes for development of human resources.
 Each country should set similar goals.
 The Commission recommends that a minimum of 10 per cent of the reductions in defence expenditure be invested in education.

ption for the second round of this resolution92m.0m It notes the92m importance0m of developing and maintaining a flexible and practical regulation of92m the0m medium and long-term distribution92m of0m affected human resources.<eop> 3. As long as transmission infrastructure remains the issue for the armed forces, this standards should not be abandoned. The military piping capability must be provided to allied organisations under a national or international model 6. The Commission recommends that IT-supply92m and0m other services should invest in improving the quality and reliability of their distributed internet services. 7

 _Qurrah asked as he crept up the hill toward the dark man as if approaching a god._
 You know the words.
 Can I trust you?
 _The red eyes flared in laughter._ Can you trust anyone?

"In answer to the core of your question, Jasmin thinks it's because I've finally gone over the edge, that in essence I've snapped due to the stress, and this, 'obsession,' as she terms it, is merely a novel way of committing suicide."
 My heart started racing again, but he wasn't done.
 "The other school of thought is that I'm more of a healer than anyone realized, and that I couldn't resist your obvious need."
 He'd lost me there.
 "Wait, what do you mean?"
 Alec paused for several seconds before answering.
 "You glow.

They'd been discussing, brainstorming even.
 I didn't know what it meant.
 I didn't even know if it was a good thing.
 It made Brandon more intriguing, but he hardly needed any more help there.
 With a sigh of frustration, I walked into Physics, smiled at Mrs. Alexander, and took my normal seat.
 I could pretty much set my watch by Alec's arrival.
 Apparently it wasn't cool to be caught inside a classroom more than fifteen seconds before the bell rang.
 It was a sign of just how far removed from reality I was that he was able to sit down in the other corner before I even realized he'd stepped through the door.
 I realized I must have been woolgathering for longer than I'd thought, and reached for my notebook.

Stupid dust.
 I watched Chevelle’s face as my eyes fluttered shut, exhausted.
 My dreams brought him close, a much-too-vivid kiss on the cheek that burned like fire.
 My skin was blistering, I could feel the color.
 It swirled around me and shocked me awake again.
 I lay on the floor, eyes wide, body unmoving.
 I was weak, tired, still under the influence, but I heard voices.
 I didn’t move as I listened to discern if they were real.
 They seemed to be close, but muffled—maybe in the next room or down a corridor—as they echoed off the stones.

“I’m coming,” he said, marching after his brother.
 He hid his pain well.
 The alley opened up to the main street, running south from the center of town into the forest beyond.
 It was there that the bulk of combat had spread.
 Elves battled in the street, horribly outnumbered.
 They were skilled, though, and a steady stream of arrows from homes continued to weaken the human forces.
 “Halt here,” Qurrah said.
 To their right was a two-story elven home.
 Three bowmen fired from the windows at a party of fifteen soldiers.

He wasn't sure this trip was such a good idea after all.
 Sharing her dream was going to make him fall even more deeply in love with her.
 And when she left, he'd be devastated.
 But remembering the excitement on her face as she'd danced with the actor, he couldn't regret it.
 The next day they went to Universal Studios.
 "This is set up like an amusement park," Rick told her as he bought their tickets.
 "So even if it isn't authentic, I think you'll enjoy it."
 "I know I will."
 In reality, she wasn't sure.

 Jasmin interrupted before I could say anything.
 "Any slower and you'd have been cut off from the rest of us by those mutts."

“I believe so.

 Harruq patted his swords.
 “So be it.
 What’s the plan?”
 Qurrah could see two men positioned on either side of the campfire.
 They kept their backs to the fire and sat far enough away so their eyes would not fully adjust to its light.
 They camped within a sparse copse of trees, the trunks not nearly thick enough to hide their approach.
 “They are wise and alert,” he whispered.

 Not to worry though, I have pretty good control of it now.
 Nasty, poisonous stuff.” She laughed again, “You know, that’s what Chevelle thought I intended the first time I dusted you.” I recalled the panic in his voice before he whisked her away.
 As disastrous a night as that had been, this one hadn’t gone much better.
 “Ruby, please take Frey back to the house.” Chevelle was standing behind us.
 I was too exhausted to jump, but Ruby merely glanced back at him, not at all surprised he was there.
 Her face crinkled.
 “Didn’t go well?” He didn’t respond but was obviously frustrated.
 I couldn’t tell if it was with Ruby or whatever hadn’t gone well.

A few seconds later I was outside and running.
 The moon was so obscured by clouds it provided only minimal light, but even the poor visibility couldn't convince me to slow my flight through the near jungle waiting outside the house.
 I could barely make out the stone path that led through the garden, but I stumbled along it as quickly as I could with my sprained ankle, deciding between branches in the path completely at random.
 I'd only been running for a few seconds when lightning tore its first gash in the night sky and opened up the way for a monsoon-like rainstorm.
 Within a few seconds the cold rain was falling so hard that I couldn't see even a few feet ahead of me.
 I started shivering instantly.
 As much as my body had been through in the last few hours, I needed to find shelter before I got chilled.
 The next lightning strike was so close it lit the entire sky up.
 The telltale flash of glass up ahead was just enough to guide me to a door that was nearly hidden by the rampant foliage.
 I pulled the door open with less effort than expected, and slipped inside.

On an average, 50 per cent of firms surveyed in a cross-section of developing countries report that skill shortages are a serious constraint on their growth.
 Firms that adopt new technologies report even more serious problems.
 In addition, the work force in many developing countries also lacks advanced productive skills for agriculture and a broad range of other basic vocations.
 The proportion of the labour force in the 20-24 age category that have undergone formal vocational training ranges from a low of 5 per cent in countries such as India and 28 per cent in Mexico to as high as 96 per cent in Korea.
 Vocational training systems need to be substantially strengthened to close the gap, including training for farmers, skilled crafts, self-employment and entrepreneurship.
 Advances in multimedia technology now makes it possible to utilize computers, internet and even television broadcasts to deliver a wide range of educational information and vocational skills that otherwise would be unavailable or very costly to disseminate.
 Upgrading the quality of education and enhancing the skills of the work force will accelerate job creation the world over.
 Distance education provides new opportunities for achieving the goal of education for all within a span of a few years.

Again he felt a cold chill, this time creeping across his arms like frost spiders.

 “No, Freya.
 They will not know I saw you.” “They are looking for me?” Terror crept into my voice.
 I was Chevelle’s captive, but he’d given me some sort of reprieve.
 The thought of council brought the danger of my situation to the forefront.

 But really, I can shoot a bow with skill.” Doi’van and Imeralda looked at him doubtfully.
 “The challenge,” said Doi’van, “is not to be simply good but to be able to outshoot over one hundred other highly skilled warriors, and the targets are multiple and difficult including a moving target.

Just looking at him drove every other thought out of my mind.
 If the girl who'd just walked by me without acknowledging the existence of any of us lesser beings was every boy's ideal physical specimen, the boy was every girl's dream.
 A gorgeous fantasy breathed into life by some merciful goddess, one who wanted to give us each a glimpse of what awaited good little girls in the afterlife.
 Skin that was a gorgeous shade of tan, not at all artificial-looking, disappeared into the collar of a thin, light-blue button-down shirt.
 The cut of his clothing hinted at designer origins, but the garment was mostly notable for the way it stretched over a pair of broad shoulders that looked like they'd been chiseled from marble, or possibly cast in bronze.
 My eyes made it as far as the equally impressive chest before I forced them upwards.
 Anyone built like that should be ugly to keep things in balance.
 Not him.
 His square jaw and even features were nothing less than perfection.

The impact of macro-economic reforms on agriculture has been most severe in the countries of Eastern and Central Europe, where production in this sector has fallen drastically over the past few years.
 Technology
 Slower growth in productivity can be attributed to a slowdown in the development of improved hybrid varieties, shortages of quality seeds and fertilizers, and the absence of techno-infrastructure facilities needed for storage and processing, expansion of markets, transport and distribution.
 Environment
 A number of factors are posing serious obstacles to productivity growth and threaten even current levels of production.
 Of the poor, 80 per cent in Latin America, 60 per cent in Asia and 50 per cent in Africa live on marginal land of low productivity and high susceptibility to environmental degradation.
 Raising productivity on these lands can be extremely difficult.
 Quality farmlands are being lost at an astonishing rate to diversion for non-farm uses, desertification, deforestation, soil erosion, and the depletion and pollution of water resources.
 These factors have resulted in the degradation of nearly one billion hectares worldwide since the Second World War.
 In addition, climatic changes resulting from the increased emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are expected to exert additional negative impact over the long term, the extent of which is difficult to assess.

The power of these measures lies not in the enactment of laws but in their enforcement.
 Enforcement should be made mandatory and automatic.
 At the same time, it must be recognized that force alone can never eliminate these problems at their roots.
 Aggressive energies must be given constructive channels through which to express themselves positively in economic development.
 Unless and until famine and poverty are eliminated, both in developing countries and in the inner cities of the North, these energies will continue to find negative expression through violence.
 Therefore, a comprehensive approach is called for.
 The measures proposed here must be viewed in conjunction with recommendations made elsewhere in this report to eradicate hunger and unemployment.
 Linkages to commodity trade
 Isolated and independently pursued policies, which appeared highly beneficial at the time enacted, often result in unexpected and unwanted consequences that negate the benefits of the original measures.
 The refusal of high-income nations to meet the demands of developing countries for protection of commodity prices is an example.

No?
 Don’t know him?
 Anyway, I was sitting there and there was a legal pad on the coffee table because earlier in the day I had tried writing a song about my mother—don’t ask—and it was sitting there like an invitation and I was speeding like a hell-rooster, man, and I just picked up the pad and this big fat marker, I mean I was writing these huge thick letters on the  page (laughs) and I just started, “You were mean to me/Leave me alone, let me sit in my tree/You were a snake, I needed you then/you were like bad heroin.”  And I ripped the whole thing off in about an hour.
 And I recorded it that night in my living room, fingers tearing over my strings till they bled, I was playing so hard, like Richie, and that song, that was recorded in my home—it sounds like it.
 But it was born of anger, and so, well, it’s not one of my faves.
 Lor came back about dawn and I was still up and I was crying, just sitting there crying with the guitar in my lap, and she put her arms around me, and that’s the story of that song.
 Last time I took speed.

“Since you’re down here, how about I—”
 “I’m fine.
 I’m fine.” Harruq sat up, breathing heavily even though the sparring match had been relatively casual.
 The elf smirked and trotted away.
 “Hey, Aurelia,” Harruq said.
 “Yes, Harruq?” She turned around.
 Harruq tapped his fingers against the hilts of his swords and glanced about the clearing.
 “I…‌you still want to hear that story?” he asked.
 The playful atmosphere vanished into the trees.
 Aurelia returned and sat on her heels.

“It is a pleasure to meet you.

 Aurelia laughed at Harruq’s flabbergasted look.
 “I am Aurelia Thyne,” she said, offering a quick curtsy.
 “And it will take years to civilize that big lug.
 I’m not sure I have the patience.”
 “If your patience matches your beauty then my brother will soon be dressed in nobles’ finest, sipping wine and commenting on the taxing errors of our dear King of Neldar.”
 Aurelia blushed.

And she was this novelist’s daughter and so she was cool and kind of bohemian and had this apartment in Midtown, upper floor, with a nice view of Poplar.
 So, I just showed up there one evening.
 And, you won’t believe this, but she was just out of the shower and was wearing nothing but a bathrobe.
 And her skin was glistening with dampness.
 I thought I had stumbled into heaven, man.
 I thought, nothing is gonna be easier than falling into bed with this beautiful woman.
 So, after some awkward small talk—and keep in mind, she didn’t go get dressed—I made a move.
 I think I just sort of leaned in to kiss her.
 And she let me kiss her, but, man, nothing back.
 I mean, fuck, she didn’t even open her mouth.

 Ignoring my family was one of the reasons she sited.
 If it hadn’t of happened to me, then the irony would have had me rolling on the floor laughing my ass off.
 Karen – Embarrassing things are so much funnier when they happen to strangers.
 It always hurts when they happen to you, and some other jerk finds it funny.

I always wanted to touch him.
 “Frey,” Chevelle began in a measured tone.
 I cut him off, trying to sound calm.
 “What happened?” “It would seem the council has attacked us.” I was too numb to draw in the quick breath I expected.
 My cheeks tingled.
 I didn’t think I could feel my hands.
 “Attacked you,” he clarified.
 Something came out of my chest that sounded like a moan.
 I blinked, too slow.
 “Attacked?” “They must have tried to strengthen your bonds.” I knew I should have been shocked but I couldn’t produce the feeling.

He's in no kind of way needing yet more to fret about.
 Just let me catch my breath and I'll be as right as ever."
 Several minutes later, once the renewed bout of coughing had subsided, Mallory looked back up at me with wan features.
 "How did it happen?
 What brought things between Brandon and our Alec to a head?"
 "It was my fault.
 I'd been dating Brandon, and we went to a party.
 Only while we were there he tried to do things I wasn't comfortable with.
 When I told him no, he--they--threw me out and told me to find my own way home."
 It was harder to relate the story than I'd expected, but Mallory's cluck of disapproval over Brandon's actions helped a little.

We were so proud of our mother and we loved to tell our friends where she worked.
 Our friends would openly wonder why a mother would be working at all.
 It was very unusual in that time period not to have a father.
 Our friends were puzzled by our missing parent, our working mother, and our home with our grandparents.
 We were an oddity in the sixties to almost everyone we met.
 Other parents would question us when we visited our friend’s homes, extracting information that we were ignorant enough to share and which likely hit the gossip circuit immediately.
 The other mothers were threatened by our mother, as she was beautiful and divorced!
 I would later realize how poorly my mother was treated by other mothers, and how she endured many unwanted sexual advances and groping by their spouses and her employers.
 It was the sixties, and my mother was damaged goods in their eyes; she was vulnerable.
 We eventually moved out of my grandparents’ home to an apartment in Los Angeles and then to a small rental house in Burbank that backed up to a military plant.

His tired smile had the feel of resignation, of something that'd been well argued over the years.
 "Will you play something for us, Mother?
 Adriana hasn't had the pleasure of listening to your songs."
 I'd rarely seen anyone change moods so quickly.
 "No.
 You know it isn't ready.
 I'll tell you when I've perfected it.
 Yes, you can bring Rachel, but I can't let anyone listen to it before it's ready."
 Alec bowed his head in acquiescence, grasping my hand as he turned to leave.
 His mother grabbed his arm before he could complete the motion.

"OK."  He stroked her hair.
 "Why don't you close your eyes and just think about home?
 I won't touch you or say a word."
 "All right."
 She closed her eyes and began thinking about Davis and how it felt to dance with him.
 She thought about her mother and father and brother and how they'd laughed and talked at meals before her brother had been disowned.
 She thought about Tom and the speakeasy.
 She opened her eyes to see Rick watching her anxiously.
 She swallowed.

Down the road a few blocks was a large Baptist church.
 Since my profession of faith, my only steps in God's direction were reading through the Bible, praying now and then, and getting baffled by J.D.
 Salinger's Franny and Zoey, about a girl who goes around constantly muttering "Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on us."
 Her family decides she's crazy, and I agreed.
 Hoping to keep the light alive, I visited several churches that gave me the creeps, with clammy skin and something like nausea, the same feeling I have gotten from the sallow eyes of anorexics who obviously courted suicide, and from remembering nights I had to spend with my sinister grandmother, the Christian Scientist.
 Another couple churches reminded me of the country club where I used to smash golf balls until I grew weary of the country club people.
 I tried a few college youth groups whose leaders appeared either self-righteous or too naive to offer much truth.
 After all, I surmised, they hadn't witnessed black people living on a quarter an hour, or attended many funerals, or gotten beat up for no reason and realized they could easily do murder.
 I felt as lost as Raskolnikov, in Crime and Punishment.

"Yes."
 She'd become so accustomed to being honest with him that she didn't even think about dissimulating.
 "Why?"
 When she merely glanced up at him and quickened her pace, he caught her arm.
 "I'm sorry--don't be mad.
 I'll buy you some frozen yogurt.
 That'll make you feel better."
 She gave him a small smile, but when they reached the yogurt stand, she said that she didn't want any.
 She was quiet during the ride home, and after a few attempts to draw her into conversation, he left her alone, unable to figure out what was bothering her.

 Scene 2
 Later that day.
 An art gallery.
 Several pedestals with ‘art’, one being a cardboard box supposedly filled with ceramic pieces.
 And several paintings are on display.
 The art work all has spotlights on it, in addition to the regular lighting.
 Several people are looking at the creations and acting like they are holding conversations as they move about and look at the exhibit.
 Liz and her mom are speaking apart from the crowd.

Doi’van, sounding like granite, said, “I know Taiga is involved.” The other two nodded, but did not pursue that thought.
 Rodregas then said, “I agree we are just starting to figure out that there is something big going on.
 I can’t believe even the Immortalists would be crazy enough to go up against both the Celestial Gods and the Daemon Lordsof the Infernal though.” Imeralda nodded and said, “What price is so high as to be even better than God hood?” The three sat silent for a few minutes soaking in that question.
 Rodregas looked at Imeralda and asked, “Well, we can’t answer that today, but how did you break Van’dret’s spell?” Imeralda nodded and with a smile said, “I always hoped that if I had to take on a sorcerer it would be in the Forest where I would have an edge, but no, it had to be in a hallway!

 So I had to work around the spell.

She was beautiful and it shocked me that she had ever considered anything else and to the point that she tried to destroy herself.
 I couldn’t help but compare her in my mind to Ashley.
 A young man was next.
 He spoke with a Jersey tough guy accent, was animated as he addressed the room, and his posture was that of some hoodlum walking the streets.
 He wore a sleeveless white tank top (a wife beater) revealing tattoos covering both his arms and wrapping all the way up around his neck.
 It seemed like an unusual choice of clothing given the ceremony and the fact that our son had requested that we bring him a suit, but we were looking across such a diverse room that it actually did fit.
 He was warm and friendly and although his appearance shocked me at first, just as our first impression of this facility had, he too won me over.
 He had high praise for many of the staff and students and high hopes for what was once a dismal future when he was a drug dealer and an addict.
 He admitted that he had started his life as a gang member.
 His life of “gang banging” had led him to do unthinkable things to others and also lead him to a life filled with an abundance of drugs.

“An elf named Aurelia,” Qurrah said as he sat up.
 He rubbed his eyes, still feeling groggy.
 “Why do you ask?”
 “Because he has rejected us, my disciple,” Velixar said.
 “His strength has left him.
 My heart burns with this betrayal, and I must know who to punish.”
 Qurrah felt ill at ease.
 All around him, the sea of undead swayed and moaned as if they shared their master’s anger.

Brandon tensed up for a second, and then his massive arm relaxed under my hand as he followed my gaze.
 "That's Ben."
 His voice dropped to a rumbling whisper.
 "The one I told you about the other day."
 It was incredibly obvious, all the while making absolutely no sense.
 He was obviously uncomfortable this morning, just like you'd expect from someone who was in the unenviable position of telling off a borderline psychopath.
 Everything I'd seen substantiated Brandon's explanation, but why would Jasmin become so enamored of someone so average-looking?
 Not only that, what were the odds Ben was one of the eight males in America who would decide they weren't interested in dating the most gorgeous girl on the planet, even if she was a nut case?
 I was still trying to sort out all the pieces when Brandon fished his cell phone out of a pocket and checked the time.

As I negotiated the crooked path between desks, I found myself looking forward to the class.
 Right up until Alec slipped into the classroom a few seconds before the bell rang.
 If there'd been any justice in the universe, he'd have somehow gotten uglier over the last few hours.
 That or I'd have developed some kind of partial immunity to him.
 Neither was the case, he was just as unearthly gorgeous as he'd been in the hall.
 The sight of him was almost overwhelming.
 As he slipped into a desk an aisle away from me, I tried to breathe deeply and slowly in a futile effort to calm my racing heart.
 It helped a little when he slid the desk back a few feet.
 As long as I watched Mrs. Alexander I couldn't see Alec anymore.
 It seemed like I could still feel him though.

A swelling of nerves in his gut almost forced him to leave.
 Several men in front of him turned away, dejected or angry.
 He didn’t hear the reasons why and didn’t want to know.
 The idea of so much money, more than enough to buy warm food and clean drink, kept him there.
 At last it was his turn, and he approached the table where Alvrik sat chewing on a piece of bone long since void of meat.
 “You,” he said before Harruq could mutter a word.
 “You don’t look like all the others.”
 “I’m not like the others.”
 “That so?” Alvrik’s face hadn’t changed in the slightest.
 “Tell me why.”

"What do you mean?"
 "Are you going to tell her I'm from 1927?"
 "Are you kidding?

 She smiled, but all at once her smile dissolved into an uncomfortable blush.
 "Rick," she began hesitantly, "will you have to tell her that-that I'm living with you?"
 "No."
 He raised her knuckles to his lips.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart—I never considered that living here with me might make you uncomfortable."

Sparks rained down as he clanged his swords together.
 “Is that how you feel?” she asked.
 The tears in her eyes ran down her cheeks, not to be replaced by any more.
 “So be it.” She took up her staff and held it defensively.
 “You are a fool, Harruq.
 May you die as one.”
 Harruq charged, his black blades gleaming.
 Every nagging doubt, every tiny part screaming for him to sheath his blades, he channeled into his mindless rage.
 His swords hacked chunks out of the staff, which held together only by Aurelia’s powerful enchantments.

A granite stone about three feet across came bounding and crashing toward us, gathering speed as it careened.
 We scrambled off the boulder and into the shelter of a grotto beside the trickling stream.
 Once we caught our breath, we crawled and peeked out from behind the rocks that formed the grotto’s walls.
 On the hillside, Tom stood waving our crowbar, bellowing laughter and prying loose another big stone.
 We tugged on our jeans and shoes while he rolled more stores and slung smaller rocks at us.
 The way his legs slashed and arms whirled, he looked like some rabid demon.
 Four of us split off, two up the canyon, two down.
 When we got beyond his range, we climbed, intending to circle above him.

Of course they could make my life miserable socially, but it wasn't like they were going to really hurt me.
 I opened my mouth to try and calm Britney down, but she cut me off.
 "You don't understand how much influence they have.

 Things were going along just fine until he pissed off Alec's mother.
 The city condemned the building and refused to change the zoning laws so he could get another place.

I snuggled closer to him.
 "Well, I just want to log my vote for you to be more selfish."
 Alec's dry chuckle hinted at old hurts.
 "According to my father, we shape shifters were created specifically for the purpose of not being selfish, of watching out for the dayborn even at the expense of our own desires."
 "You miss your dad.
 I can tell it in your voice."
 His shrug would've been imperceptible except for the fact his arms were still wrapped around me.
 "I do.

While not a large army, they were the most feared warriors in the world.
 The leader of The Immortal Guards was called the Commander General, and Rodregas knew of his deeds and background though he had never met him.
 General Rigoria had once been the Grand Marshal of the same Knightly Order that had trained Rodregas.
 The Order was unique in that it trained not just in the various martial arts but also in the magical, and recruited those who had magical power, but lacked the temperament or intelligence to be a sorcerer.
 Instead of working toward the power of sorcery, they underwent the Sigil ceremony, gaining a magical enhancement but losing the versatility of a true mage.
 Gaining such sigils was outlawed by the guide except for their own warriors, but the Order of the Soaring Heavens was also the traditional sources for the Gods own Paladins, and even the Celestial Guild had never dared to anger the gods by interfering with their use of sigils.
 Rigoria had been one of the greatest of the Order of the Soaring Heavens, but he had grown old and his health had failed him.
 When tempted by the Immortalists with a new body, he had accepted.
 Even though such action was anathema to the very teachings of the Order, he had become an officer of the Immortal Guards, and eventually their leader.
 Several of the most powerful Knights had over the centuries, formed the officer core of The Immortal Guards.

Chevelle remained standing where he was, his back to me.
 I had to decide.
 Walk within feet of him going to the library to research him or run home and hide.
 My stomach churned.
 It was ridiculous.
 I took a deep breath and kept walking, approaching the split.
 He turned to me, scarcely a few feet away.
 “Good morning.” He nodded as he spoke, his voice as smooth as velvet.
 I managed to snap my slack jaw shut at the same moment I realized I had angled my body toward him when he’d addressed me.
 I mentally cursed, but I could recover this; I would just keep going in the same direction as if I were on my way to town, because I was on my way to town.

 I beat him within an inch of his life in front of her.
 Karen and her roommate did everything they could to pull me off of him but my rage for his complete abandonment of our friendship in so many ways had escalated to the perfect storm.
 It seemed he had taken everything from me and he had been my closest friend for the last six years and I snapped.

 Pete and Karen later married, had a couple of kids and, in his late twenties, Pete died of a heroin overdose.

 Harruq and Qurrah waited anxiously at their door.
 They were fully armed and ready.

 Wrapped around his arm, Qurrah’s whip writhed hungrily.
 Their eyes rarely blinked, but as hour after hour passed and no blanket of shadow came to them, their patience wore thin.

I struggled to keep up.
 I was sure I knew the cause of his hurry.
 He’d decided he wanted to get this journey over with, end it and return me to the council for punishment, to be done with me.
 We rode long into the evening, well past sunset, and I began to wonder if he would stop at all.
 I was contemplating possible ways to sleep on a horse when he finally stopped.
 We were riding through a small pass, the moonlight barely lighting our way, and Chevelle’s horse disappeared.
 My head swiveled, searching for any sign of them, and then my own horse turned beneath an overhang and stopped in a cavern so dark I hadn’t seen it until we were there.
 Chevelle tossed out a small flame, giving us enough light to dismount.
 The horses walked to one end of the cavern, their hoofbeats echoing softly, as we remained in the other.
 “Frey.” Chevelle turned to me as he spoke.

I expected him to look at me like I was mad.
 Instead, he looked like it was… endearing.
 He stood and walked over to me, taking my hand to help me up.
 When he touched me, I tried to fight the heat that ran up my neck.
 I couldn’t and embarrassment caused my cheeks to color as well.
 I peered up at him through my now-dark bangs and could have sworn it amused him.

Once we were on our way, I didn’t mind so much.
 I was enjoying being back in the rhythm of the ride, not to mention the break from training.
 Conversation flowed easily as we made our way farther up the mountain.
 I had been thinking about my discussion with Steed, but hadn’t decided how to respond if I were asked again about the incident in the clearing, about controlling the snake.
 No one knew about the hawk and I wasn’t sure how I had done it to begin with, so I couldn’t exactly explain it.
 It would have been like explaining how to wiggle your ears to someone who wasn’t able.
 But it had been easy for me, much easier than fire even.
 I drew my cloak tighter around my shoulders and yawned as I considered my horse.
 I’d had so much trouble learning to control him, trying to push him from the outside.
 Falling back from the group only enough not to gain notice, I tried to settle into his mind as I had the snake and the hawk.

The creation of something new.
 From where there was nothing something now exists: songs, recordings, an album.
 The making of Turntable Poison was a liminal time, a time of congruity, or grand passion.
 The melding of the three (sometimes four) musicians was a Synchronicity.
 It can happen more than once but it happened at least once for Black Lung.
 It’s there on that vinyl circle, waiting for the needle like a junkie.
 And for anyone lucky enough to find that masterpiece in someone’s garage sale, in some second-hand record shop (where I hear it can go for upwards of a hundred dollars or more), at some friend’s apartment, there is knowledge passed.
 Because anyone who hears Turntable Poison hears right away what could have been, what should have been.

And when he'd read the pages about her and realized they hadn't changed, he'd wondered if maybe it was because she hadn’t stayed in 1927, had come back to 2011.
 Or rather, would come back to 2011.
 He tightened his arms around her.
 "I love you, Marie."
 "I love you too.
 And I want to marry you.
 How soon can we get married?
 And where's my ring?"
 He laughed, setting her back to look at her.

Marie blinked back tears of confusion.
 She was betrothed to Davis.
 But it was getting harder and harder to remember why she'd fallen in love with him.
 He didn't spend much time with her, didn't hold her very often, didn't do anything really fun.
 And he wasn't nearly as handsome as Rick.
 Rick had beautiful blue eyes and-and a broad, muscular chest that she got to see every morning if she woke up before he did.
 In her dreams, he never had on a shirt, and he was always smiling.
 That dream might change now.
 Right now the image in her mind was of his face as it had come closer and closer to hers.
 She'd wanted him to kiss her.

Harruq stared at the body, his hands shaking from the excitement and his breath thunderous in his ears.
 A hand touched his shoulder.
 He recoiled as if struck.
 “Well done,” Qurrah said, his eyes locked on the corpse.
 Harruq recognized that look.
 His brother had seen something he wanted, and he would have it.
 “A strong life and a fresh death.”

This has been aided by a worldwide rush to renewable energy power generation led by such regions as California, which now produces 10,000 megawatts of electricity from wind power and has mandated an increase in pollution-free motor vehicles from the present level of 5 per cent to 25 per cent by 2010.
 Common sense tells us it is not possible simply to wish away the serious problems barring these achievements.
 We need the technology vastly to improve productivity in poor countries.
 We need the organizational know-how to create effective administrative and political systems in transition states and to restructure international institutions.
 We require enormous investments in constructive economic activities – as opposed to lavish arms spending – to generate jobs and higher incomes for hundreds of millions of people in the developing world, and by extension to stimulate further economic growth and job creation in the West.
 All these essential ingredients are available in abundant measure, if only we choose to employ them for our common benefit.
 Yet even this is not enough.
 Otherwise, we would already have accomplished many of our goals.
 Above and beyond these material, social and financial resources, we need a new vision, a new perspective and new attitudes about what can and must be done.
 If the events of the past seven years prove anything, it is that a massive change of attitude and perspective, such as the one brought about between East and West, is imminently possible and incredibly powerful.

Humans and Orqui are both in the middle of their two extremes and becoming emotionally involved with either always ends with heartbreak.” Doi’van’s deep voice was just stating a fact, if an unpleasant one.
 Rodregas nodded, he agreed but he was not the young man he looked.
 “I do understand that, and I expect nothing from her.”  He smiled and said, “But I do plan to enjoy what we do have for as long as it lasts.” “And when she takes other lovers?” Doi’van asked.
 Rodregas responded with the only answer he had, “I will do my best to handle it and not get jealous,” he said.
 Rodregas knew it would be hard, but he was a hard man and he would have to manage.
 Doi’van nodded, then glanced over to see Imeralda walking over with several of the Grimoires and he added, “I was not angry, in fact, by my people’s standards I was being very easy on you since you are human and can’t handle pain like an Orqui.
 Without pain, you will not reach your potential for quickness and reflexes.
 On the practice field such quickness means fewer bruises.
 On the battle field such reflexes means life and death.” Rodregas nodded, his words held the ring of truth, but he was not looking forward to days of practices and days full of bruises.
 The pattern of their days changed.

 I suddenly felt like there was a joke I was missing out on.

Rodregas had the guard’s throat in his grasp before his opponent knew what was happening.
 The guard was not a big man and with his celestial strength Rodregas simply picked him up and squeezed.
 Rodregas felt the guard’s neck give under his grip.
 Before the slavers could react, Rodregas went from lifting him up to driving him down into the ground.
 Adrenaline was surging and suddenly Rodregas had a bloody mess in his hand.
 The guard was very dead.
 Rodregas let go of the broken neck and stood quickly, trying to clear himself of the gore.
 Both slavers looked shocked at what had happened and Rodregas moved quickly to take advantage of their surprise.

 Who is he?
 “He told me, ‘The one will rise, the one rise!
 He will destroy you!’ That’s almost the same thing as last time.” I tapped the fountain.

But with beasts like that, you are either in charge or you are game.
 I think that he probably did the right thing.
 No way to know for sure, but they did not rip him apart, so we will say he was very brave and not very stupid.” Then he added, “Of course, if you had asked me before hand, I would have said that taking food from a Dire Cat was a very stupid idea.” He finished with a smile full of sharp teeth almost a match for the lions and in a casual movement lowered his horned head in what Rodregas thought might be his equivalent of a shrug.
 The next morning they repeated the Morning Prayer and meditation ritual.
 This time while Doi’van joined in, Imeralda mostly watched.
 Afterwards Rodregas said to both, “I have been thinking that we are probably going to be here a few weeks while I finish healing up from the knife wound.
 I want to make the most of the time.” Doi’van said, “I have a feeling that you have some sort of training in mind.” Rodregas nodded and said, “I have developed some bad habits the last few years; I know my technique is rusty and now my timing is all off with my new body.
 I am not sure what your training backgrounds are, though.” He said, waving at Imeralda, who often of late was holding her Black Yew bow close with an intimacy that spoke more of a caress than holding a weapon, “Clearly, Imeralda likes the bow.” Rodregas continued, “Even though Imeralda plans to stay out of the middle of things, learning some basic hand-to-hand and sword fighting is a good idea.
 Doi’van and I can spar with each other, which will help us get used to fighting against the sigil warriors of The Immortal Guard.

I hadn't thought about what it would be like this year."
 Alec nodded like he'd just checked a box off on some kind of mental list.

 "I guess.

 A month ago I would have thought that was a good thing, that it would be one less thing to remind me of Dad and Cindi.

He looked into my eyes like he saw something there, like he really knew me.
 We gazed out over the cliff, at the horizon… endless.
 I felt his hand on my back and closed my eyes, relaxing into the comfortable, familiar feel of it.
 He pushed me with full force.
 I flew off the cliff, falling straight down.
 I stared back at him as he stood, watching me fall, nothing but open sky above and below.
 I couldn’t imagine why he’d throw me from the cliff, couldn’t think of the magic to stop myself, couldn’t see when I would crash into the base, the rocks below.
 My arms flailed as I jerked awake.
 The group stared at me.

 We sat in silence for several seconds as I tried to process how that new piece of information fit in with everything else I already knew.
 The obvious, if somewhat selfish, implication was that maybe it really was possible for someone like Alec to want to be with someone like me.
 There were plenty of other things to think about though.
 "Wow, is that hard?

Early start today?” My voice was determined.
 “Yes, I want to practice growing.” She glanced at the pendant against my chest.
 She was silent for a moment as she looked into my eyes, almost searching.
 She was probably worried I was sad or missing my mother.
 “Not today.
 It seems I have business with the Council this morning.” Her mouth turned down in a grimace.
 “Oh.” All right, it wasn’t like I didn’t have plenty to do.
 I’d just head to the library and try to find the missing pages to the northern clan documents.

 With the time Olga didn’t spend laboring for the sake of acquiring stuff or treating herself to luxuries, along with writing and prayer, she attended gatherings of all kinds where she could meet folks who needed her to teach, or console, or pray with them.
 She chose to live much like Jesus, who passed through the world keeping a lookout for people he could help.

 I could use Olga’s comment that a family or business person might need a bigger house to justify my bigger house.
 I have a daughter and a business, the college.
 Or two businesses.
 Agents, publishers and others encourage us writers to consider our work a business.

It was a loud smack.
 I was sure it had stung.
 Steed stood still, focused on the spot where Grey had landed and was flickering in and out of view.
 I made an effort to consider possible responses in my head, but was coming up blank.
 The nerves were gone.
 I found myself wanting Steed to win and leaned with his strikes, tensing as if they were my own.
 Grey bounded through the air once more, showing off, confident in his evident lead, and then a small rock rose at chest height in front of Steed.
 I was trying to figure out who had lifted it when Grey flashed back into view, hesitating only a moment as he considered the rock.
 At once, his face changed; he knew he’d been beaten.
 As he’d paused to study the floating rock, Steed had immobilized him and, just like that, the match was over.

She waved the explanation away.
 "Brandon's fooled people smarter than both of us put together.
 The hardest part was not being able to tell you anything."
 Alec started to open the door, but Rachel put a hand on his arm.
 "The rest of the pack is back.
 Jasmin already told them what happened.
 It doesn't look good."
 I had my mouth open and was halfway to asking what was going on when I saw Alec's expression, and swallowed my words.
 He didn't look any different than normal, in fact if I'd been standing forty or fifty feet away from him I'd probably have still thought he was just as calm and in control as always.
 This close, I could feel the anger radiating off of him.

Alec's smile was slightly apologetic.
 "Sorry about that.
 Would you like to listen as well?"
 My confusion earned me a chuckle.
 Alec reached over to the bedside table and picked up a remote that had more buttons on it than most laptops.
 A split second later piano music flooded the room through the myriad of speakers mounted on the ceiling.
 The piece Alec's mother was playing was incredibly beautiful, full of lilting chords of joy that seemed to stumble over each other in a cheerful effort to outdo their predecessors in greeting the audience.
 Five minutes later, she started the number over again, playing with variations on the minor notes, and Alec silenced the speakers with another click of his remote.
 "It's beautiful.

His smile was so beautiful it made my heart ache.

 Brandon gently captured my arm as we slipped inside the school.
 "Speaking of stars, I happened to read them last night and they told me a secret."
 "Oh, really?
 Do tell, I always love to hear a good secret."
 There was a new twinkle in his eye as he shook his head.

 It’s got that “Green River” riff to it, a chugging thing, even though it’s acoustic, it sounds like a freight train, don’t you think?
 CM:  	Ok, uh, “If You Push Your Belly Button your Legs Fall Off.”  Many critics said this was like a children’s song.

 It’s about being in bed with a new woman.

It was frail, bony.

 “Kneel.”
 Harruq did so unwillingly.
 “I am Velixar,” he continued.
 “I am the voice of Karak.
 I’ve heard much about you, Harruq Tun, bastard child of an orcish womb.
 You are strong, and I sense your anger raging to be unleashed.”
 Harruq trembled, indeed feeling that anger.
 He felt it deep inside his chest, urging him to rise and defy Velixar.

“I was afraid when they came, but as I watched Master slaughter hundreds of them with his golems and his shields of bone I felt at home amid the carnage.

 “How did you escape?” Velixar asked.
 “Master exhausted himself defending his tower,” Qurrah said, waving a dismissive hand.
 “He collapsed at the very top.
 I cast a spell upon his throat, filling it with ice.
 I watched him die and then I left that disgusting place forever.”

BG: 	I have confused recollections of my first awareness of Bob Dylan.
 I have a vague memory of hearing “Song for Woody” on FM 100, back in Memphis, which at that time was an album-oriented station, not limited to a ludicrous playlist like it is today.
 It was a source back then, a touchstone.
 You could hear music unavailable elsewhere.
 The music of the planets.
 I listened to it alone in my parent’s living room, hearing sounds that transformed me as surely as did Lorelei, the finding of my own voice.
 “Talkin World War III Blues” was beyond my ken.
 I thought, perhaps, my head would explode.
 I didn’t understand.
 In my reptile brain I have also the memory of my friend Ricky Adams’ big brother having “folk” albums, some by a handsome, young, angular-faced singer named Bob Dylan, whose songs were meant as social anthems, wrong-righters.

 When a fellow vacated his bar stool, I excused myself from the table and moved there.
 I ordered another shot of tequila, and stared at the mirror behind the liquor shelf, wondering if I looked any different than before I surrendered to Jesus.
 I couldn’t spot a single feature that appeared more saintly or pure.
 I felt no more likely to hand over my jacket to whomever asked, let alone to throw in my shirt.
 The only change I recognized, I felt more confounded than ever.
 Someone had told me, when you drink tequila, make sure you count the shots.
 So I kept count.
 I was on seven, and still waiting for the buzz, when I sensed my stool tipping backward.
 If I had asked, once I recovered, Cliff would’ve told me what else happened between the time I started tipping and the morning after.

The faery men drew their double swords and charged at her.
 I released an arrow and it buried itself in one of their necks.
 It fell backward and they turned to my hiding spot, searching for me.
 Two knives flew and a dwarf and man collapsed on the ground.
 I saw Jason hide behind his tree again.
 One dwarf got too close to Emily and she raised her arms, dousing him in flames.
 He screeched and fell to the ground, withering and then went still.
 Seth ran from the trees, brandishing his sword.
 He swung it around and clashed with one of the faery's swords.

 “I haven’t learned animal magic.” His lip pursed, one brow dropping low, the same strange look he’d given the first time I’d mentioned learning magic.
 “Just feel it, Elfreda.” I ignored the slight annoyance that Chevelle must have told him my full name.
 “I don’t understand,” I told him.
 “You don’t learn magic,” Steed said.
 “It’s a part of you.

 “It is a pleasure to meet you.

 “I am Aurelia Thyne,” she said, offering a quick curtsy.
 “And it will take years to civilize that big lug.
 I’m not sure I have the patience.”
 “If your patience matches your beauty then my brother will soon be dressed in nobles’ finest, sipping wine and commenting on the taxing errors of our dear King of Neldar.”

The rapid shift of Eastern European and former Soviet republics to radically different political and economic systems demonstrates that changes of even greater magnitude than this can be brought about rapidly.
 There is likely to be far greater support for this change than may at first appear possible.
 Russia may actively support and China offer only nominal resistance, once a clear conception of the new structure has emerged.
 Ironically, the major opposition to this change is most likely to come from the past defenders of democratic principles in the Western world, rather than from the newly liberated nations of Eastern Europe.
 If so, this will follow the normal law of social development in which the vanguards of previous revolutions become the principal opponents of the next stage of progress.
 Even here it is likely to come primarily from entrenched vested interests, not the general public.
 A mere tinkering with or modest amendment to the structure of the UN will only perpetuate the inherent inadequacies of the present system and postpone its maturation into a truly effective instrument for global political, economic and social integration and collective accomplishment.
 Many proposals are being floated to modify its workings, mostly by expanding representation on the Security Council.
 As an interim measure and first steps, the immediate addition of five more permanent members to the Security Council, based on the criteria of population and economic status, and the abolition of the veto power are fully justified.
 However, these changes do not go far enough in furthering the interests of global peace and development.

He reached out and placed a hand under my chin, bringing my face up to meet his.
 The flush that followed was not from embarrassment.
 Heat flooded my neck, and I felt it might engulf me as he spoke my name.
 “Frey.” “Yes.” It was all I could manage.
 His eyes held mine and I could swear he was searching for something.
 He opened his mouth to speak, but the door of the wardrobe flew open.
 “Oh.” Ruby giggled the tiniest bit.
 “Excuse me.

As Velixar reached down, his maggoty face smiling and his hand dripping unholy magic, a wave of arrows rained upon him.

 Dieredon staggered to his feet, his bow still in his hands.

 “Is going to a different world supposed to be vacation-relaxing-in-the-sun easy?” He smirked, “I never said that.” “You implied it,” I said, with a roll of my eyes.
 He sighed and pushed me into the doorway, the dark, swirling mist swallowing me up.
 I felt his hands leave my back for a second and then they were back.
 The chilly feeling welcomed me, like a long lost friend.
 As soon as the mist cleared, I was standing in a forest clearing.
 The sky was hazy and dreary, making me want to run back to Earth.

They loaned us their room until evening.
 Room service delivered bourbon and ginger ale.
 Around noon, we adjourned to the pool, on the lookout for showgirls.
 At least that was my motive.
 The pool featured a high dive like the one at Carmen Ranch Club where Eric worked part-time as an apprentice lifeguard and trampoline instructor.
 He climbed, sprang, jackknifed and got a few cheers from spectators, including several showgirls.
 Though I had never attempted a high dive before, after some bourbon, the feat looked simple.
 Inches from the end of the board was a depression full of water, on which my foot slipped.
 I tried to stop, but too late.

 “Correct,” Velixar said, his smile visible beneath his hood.

 They had come to the same thought already.
 “Oh,” Rodregas said, “here.” He pulled out one of the extra short swords and its harness from where he had it stashed in the wagon and handed it to Doi’van.
 “If you guys promise not to stab me in the night, it makes sense for you two to be armed.
 Though, I do not think that harness is big enough to fit you without some work.” Rodregas held his last unclaimed short sword up and said, “And here is one for you, Imeralda.” She picked it up, but he could tell she did not know how to handle the weapon.
 Doi’van looked comfortable enough, but the handle was almost too small for his large hand and it looked more like a large dagger in his hand than a sword.

 I flipped open my notebook and tried to distract myself with a brief sketch, only to tear the page out and ball it up as the bell rang.
 I looked up to see Alec staring at me, which just made me mad.

 what that staring, is he cared about his girlfriend when it came to their relationship. "Can I tell you something," he cooed, and I smiled back. It was92m a0m different kind of amused smile but we didn't hear it.<eop> He dropped my notebook92m on0m my desk before I could take another picture with Brandon.

She smiled then, reaching for his hand.
 "Come on--let's go."
 "Wait.
 You need to put on shorts and a shirt over your bathing suit."
 "Oh.
 OK."  She went to do as he said.
 Marie had been to the shore before, but it had been years ago.
 Her father didn't think it was appropriate for a young woman of her position to be parading around half naked.

Ahrqur nodded, his eyes seething.
 Velixar reached out and placed his hand on the elf’s forehead.
 Qurrah watched as smoke rose from their contact, yet neither flinched.
 When the necromancer drew back his hand, a strange symbol lay overtop the faint scarring of the slanted Y.
 It was of a fallen man wreathed in flame.
 “When you fall, the enchantment upon your forehead shall burn your body to ash.
 Then your soul may find peace.”
 “I shall do as you command,” Ahrqur said in a lifeless voice.
 “Of course,” Velixar said.

We were already pulling into the parking lot.
 He must have been driving even faster than normal.
 That should have triggered another panic attack, but the tension in the black Mustang was high enough to distract my subconscious for now.
 Brandon smoothly pulled the bulky car in between a pair of SUVs and cut the engine before turning and hitting me with the full force of his gray eyes.
 "Adriana, I promised to protect you.
 I know it's kind of anachronistic, but I take those kinds of promises seriously.

At the other end of the spectrum, comparable efforts must be made to raise scientific literacy, which is essential for the continued growth of technology, productivity and employment in modern society.
 The pervasive influence of science in society requires that we bridge the gap that presently divides the sciences and humanities and evolve an educational system in which science is no longer regarded as a specialized field of study.
 Fourth, radical changes are needed in the content of school curricula at all levels to make education relevant to the real needs of the students and the development of the country.
 The society whose system of education is integrated with the social aspirations of the country will develop most rapidly.
 The system of education prevalent in most developing countries is oriented toward the outer form – acquiring a degree or qualifying certificate – rather than the inner content of knowledge.
 Educated unemployment is a direct result of a system that fosters obedience and rote learning rather than individual initiative and creative thinking.
 A new system of development education needs to be introduced at all levels to equip the student with an understanding of his/her society, its achievements and potentials, and the opportunities open to each individual to participate in its future growth.
 The index of its success will be the extent to which students of this curriculum seek self-employment rather than salaried jobs.
 Fifth, minimum and average educational levels should be raised in all countries.
 Two centuries ago education was a luxury of the rich and it was simply inconceivable that every member of the population in any country could receive even a minimum level of education.

No, I was getting better, not worse.
 I felt a light pressure on my forehead and my eyes flew open instinctively, though I’d had no response from them all the hours I’d struggled to force them open.
 It was Ruby.
 She sighed with relief.
 “Oh, Frey.” I was suddenly surrounded and the sight made my head spin.
 I closed my eyes tight in an attempt to stop it.
 “Get her a drink,” someone commanded.
 I felt the hand in mine then, as it was pulled away, replaced with a glass.

It hadn't been real, either because I hadn't examined Simon and Nathanial's lifeless bodies, or maybe because I was repressing the experience like I'd done with so many other parts of my life lately.
 I could feel my mind trying to shut down, hoping to cushion me from the worst implications of what was coming.
 I knew it was going to be bad, could feel it in a sickening, only-seconds-away-from-vomiting kind of way, but couldn't follow the chain of logic through to the very end.
 I let Jasmin help me pull my books together, and then numbly followed her out to the hallway.
 Alec and the rest of the pack were waiting for us at my locker.
 Jasmin calmly opened my locker and put my things away while I was still trying to come to terms with everything.
 Alec took my hand.
 "Are you okay?"
 I shook my head.

Strangely enough that didn't bother me as much as I thought it would.
 It was like walking down the lane managed to put things back in perspective for me.
 How could I be put out about something I hadn't ever actually believed was possible?
 I almost refused to believe my eyes when I came around the bend in our lane and saw a black Mustang parked on the side of the road.
 Brandon stood up from where he'd been leaning against the sports car and flashed me a blinding smile.
 He moved towards me with a casual grace that made little shivers run through me despite my earlier decision not to let his interest, or lack thereof, affect me.
 "I had a bet with myself that you weren't going to wait.
 Somehow the fact I just lost doesn't matter now."
 It didn't seem possible he was talking to me, that anyone so gorgeous could mean something like that about me.
 I opened my mouth, maybe to laugh the comment off, or otherwise hedge my bets against the humiliation and inevitable mocking laughter.

It was stupid to have risked a panic attack when I was already borderline depressed, but that was what I was looking at now.
 I'd picked a seat that wasn't visible from the doorway, so I just put my head down and let the twin traumas run their course.
 By the time I was feeling steady enough to leave the classroom, I had just enough time to make it to the bathroom and try to clean myself up before lunch ended.
 The rest of the day went in starts and stutters.
 I went from answering a question about the economy of post-Civil War Georgia, to watching Alec start putting together rough plans for our next group project.
 I had just enough time to notice he seemed relieved I wasn't trying to get in his way, and then Spanish was finishing up and I was headed to the tutoring lab.
 Most Friday afternoon sessions were pretty sparsely attended.
 Today was no different, which was a good thing since I probably wouldn't have done a very good job of explaining anything.
 Mrs. Campbell shut everything down before my shift started, and sent me home with a concerned look in her eye.

“This will calm you,” she said.
 A sprinkle of glitter hit my face before I had the chance to protest.
 “Just a touch,” she assured me, “just a touch.” It was too late.
 The dust had already taken effect.
 I relaxed onto the bed, just as Ruby did the same beside me.
 We stared at her ceiling unspeaking for an immeasurable amount of time.
 I rolled on my side toward her, dimly irritated she’d poisoned me again.
 Though it was much less severe this time.
 I was simply enveloped in tranquility.
 “Ruby…” Her curls had tumbled back and my complaint fell short as I was distracted by her ears.

The eyeballs hit the ground before the dead body did.
 “Hurry,” the necromancer said.
 “This is but a taste of what we must do.”
 “Very well,” Harruq said.
 He tried to follow but the pain in his side stopped him.
 He clutched his bleeding side and breathed deeply.
 His armor had saved him, but the elf had managed to penetrate deeper than he thought.
 “Are you fine, Harruq?” Qurrah asked, glancing back and halting his walk.

Shall we say a month from today?"
 The prospect of trying to catch up, all the while needing to master new material and deal with a full schedule of other classes, was too much.
 I felt tears rising to the surface even as my heartbeat sped up to near-panic attack levels.
 That was the last thing I needed, but I could only fight off so many worries at once, and I was quickly approaching my limits.
 "Now don't come unglued on me.
 The school has set aside some discretionary funds for a math tutoring lab after school every day.
 We're not fully staffed yet, but if you swing by we should be able to help clear up any questions you might have.

“Qurrah said to kill you if I didn’t love you…”
 “Yet you didn’t,” she said.
 Harruq nodded, but said nothing else.

 “Look out,” Aurelia said, shoving Harruq aside.
 The arrow hit her breast and reflected off as if hitting stone.
 She glanced at Harruq, her face a mixture of anger and fear.
 “Others have seen you kill, haven’t they?” she asked.

I thought I remembered where the closest drinking fountain was.
 Even so, I planned on getting a little lost before I found it.
 I didn't, however, plan on nearly colliding with Alec as he slowly rounded the corner in front of me.
 The tension of the near-fight earlier had distracted me from just how incredible-looking he was.
 There was no such refuge now.
 For a moment I couldn't think of anything other than how the dark blue of his shirt brought out his tan complexion.
 If his gorgeousness had stopped there, I probably would've been okay, but the little spirits in charge of keeping the universe in equilibrium must've been momentarily busy with something more important.
 The blue buttons that kept his shirt snuggly wrapped around his impressive torso were almost the exact shade of his eyes, which happened to be staring at me with a trace of something different than his normal self-assurance.
 In someone else I would've almost said gratitude, but his manner was too arrogant for that.
 More than anything else, that was what finally shook me from my reverie.

The image stuck with me so strongly that I considered it until Rachel came over and took my hand.
 "What's wrong?
 It's just the two of us now, you don't have to worry about James, and I won't tell anyone else.
 I swear."
 Rachel's promise somehow seemed like it belonged from another time.
 The sincerity pulled me further out of my safe, numb shelter.
 Something in me wanted to confide in her, was willing to risk the pain of facing reality, but I was too far gone to be able to put what I was feeling into words.
 I shook my head again, not sure if it was a refusal or something else entirely.
 Rachel took it as the former and sat down next to me, pulling her knees up tight against her chest.
 A few seconds later I heard the howl of an after-market exhaust fed by a turbo-charged engine.

Seth had been hiding a full two-handed water gun behind his back and the end was pointed at no other than me.
 “You wouldn’t,” I said, my voice dark.
 Seth gave me a maniac’s grin, “You already know the answer to that.” Then he shot me right in the face.
 I blocked most of the spray from my face but water still leaked through my fingers.
 I felt the cold water seep through my clothes and onto my skin as Seth continued to soak me.
 “Crap Jason, shut it off!” Emily hollered but it didn’t work because I heard her yell again as he sprayed her hair.
 I couldn’t see anything because my eyes were half shut and I was afraid Seth would wash my eyes out.
 “Seth seriously, stop.” You can’t command boys to do anything and to prove that, Seth shot my butt.
 Eventually they stopped, only because three water guns can hold only so much water and Emily and me looked like we could kill.

The fight was over when you surrendered or you were knocked out.
 I fought many times and I do not remember ever losing.
 As I said, I had grown up facing a much tougher opponent than anyone in the room.
 I was rarely injured because I had learned to protect myself from the powerful blows of my stepfather and I knew how to look for an opening and drop my opponent.
 By this time I was close to six feet tall and about 175 pounds.
 I was in great shape and I had endured physical punishment as training.
 Drag racing wasn’t easy on a car, and since we were constantly racing, constantly striving to make the Chevelle faster, inevitably something was always broken.
 Hitchhiking to and from work became a regular event, and I often got rides from the same people every afternoon.

The challenge lies in accomplishing this in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner.
 The FAO should launch a co ordinated international effort to extend the principles and strategies of the Green Revolution to eradicate global food shortages within a decade.
 The Green Revolution was originally applied to improving productivity of wheat and rice in high potential areas.
 After the first rounds of phenomenal success, the effort to extend it to other agricultural regions and other crops lost momentum, because the urgent necessity had been eliminated.
 Recognizing the importance of agricultural surplus to rural employment, industrialization and exports, renewed efforts are called for to apply the comprehensive, integrated approach of the Green Revolution to high potential commercial crops and to all regions.
 With the knowledge gained over the past 30 years, greater emphasis can be placed on ensuring that the productivity improvements are not only economically viable but also ecologically sustainable.
 Region-specific strategies should be adopted for mountain areas, high rainfall tropics, uplands and irrigated plains.
 The crops covered should include foodgrains and oil seeds, cotton and jute, sugar cane, fruit, vegetables, dairy, meat, medicinal plants, spices, and agro-forestry for fodder, fuel and industrial raw materials.

What do we say, oh sorry about that everyone, we just felt like leaving Earth to go to this magical place called Igneeria to do something that we don’t know about.” “Well of course, there will be some minor difficulties,” he said.
 “Minor?” I squeaked.
 “Seriously, did you not hear a word I just said?” He placed his pudgy hands on his small hips.
 “Miss don’t you think that Her Majesty would have this all planned out?
 You don’t have to worry.” Seth twirled his sword.
 “Why not, we have to tell our parents something.” “Sir, don’t worry about a thing.
 All you need to do is go home.
 Everything has been arranged.” “What do you mean, arranged?” Seth asked sharply.

“Not today.
 It seems I have business with the Council this morning.” Her mouth turned down in a grimace.
 “Oh.” All right, it wasn’t like I didn’t have plenty to do.
 I’d just head to the library and try to find the missing pages to the northern clan documents.
 “Well, I’ll see you then.” I smiled at her and headed around back again to cut through the village.
 I took my time to allow her to make her way to the Council building.
 As my feet scuffed along the path, I heard angry whispers and glanced up to find their source.
 Virden Day was leaning toward a dark figure, wearing a harsh expression and pointing out fingers on his other hand.
 Counting reasons for his argument?
 The figure turned his head as if scanning for an audience.

“Hey, Aurelia,” Harruq said.
 “Yes, Harruq?” She turned around.
 Harruq tapped his fingers against the hilts of his swords and glanced about the clearing.
 “I…‌you still want to hear that story?” he asked.
 The playful atmosphere vanished into the trees.
 Aurelia returned and sat on her heels.
 She placed a hand on his shoulder.

"Okay, apology accepted.
 It wasn't very nice, but I suppose everyone makes mistakes."
 Britney's eyes grew bright, even after such a short acquaintance, I knew she was about to launch into a blow-by-blow account of the last twelve or so hours.
 "Listen, I don't mean to be rude, but I've got to finish up my physics homework.
 Can we catch up during lunch?"
 Britney looked a little crestfallen, but her eyes quickly lit back up, and before I could get my notebook out and start writing, she'd already switched seats to one closer to a gaggle of cheerleaders.
 It was amazing that I hadn't made the connection between light, the fact that light acted like a wave, and the rainbows on the parking lot puddles, but it was all making sense now.
 By the time the bell finally rang to release the circus back into the halls, I'd finished up a reasonable outline, and was feeling pretty smart.
 Alec probably expected me to have been totally stumped, but I'd figured out the exact answer to the assignment, and I was so going to show him.

I shook my head, finding the line again…
 But I couldn’t deny it.
 Their size was about that of an elf, but all were different.
 The men were thicker.
 Not necessarily with muscle, some more bulbous.
 The women were varied as well, some thin and wiry, some stout like the males.
 Their hair was in all shades—light blond like the sun, brown as the trees, one even had rusty red, his plump cheeks peppered with light brown spots.
 And there were so many children!
 They were loud and ran round the camp all afternoon.
 And they were just as varied as the adults.

Seth was fast asleep next to me, his blue hair covering half his face.
 Emily was curled up a few feet away from me.
 Jason turned in his sleep, mumbling something unintelligent.
 I needed to talk to someone, but everyone was sleeping.
 I pushed Seth over and his eyes flew open.
 His hand went to his sword but he saw me and he relaxed.
 “What was the point of pushing me over, Jazell?” “Well, it seemed better than punching you in the side.

Cocaine was the most popular, that, and pot; but magic mushrooms and acid were also available.
 It was the late seventies, after all.
 We were also surrounded by some pretty tough guys and nobody really messed with us.
 After years of sparring with a two hundred pound Greek, I was pretty tough myself.
 We would host evening boxing matches in the living room of the house I rented with my friends.
 We had no furniture in that room.
 A boxing match would start with one person calling out another person to fight.
 You could decline but you would endure the collective shaming of the crowd.
 Several sets of boxing gloves were available and once both fighters had their gloves on, the games would begin.
 Cowering in a corner was never a good strategy as the crowd only pushed you back to the center.

“Never could we have used a mage’s power more than now,” one said.
 Aurelia blushed and waved him off.
 “Please we must…”
 A cold chill spread through her body, like water from an underground stream meeting a creek.
 She whirled and stared down the street.
 Walking without escort was a lone man shrouded in black robes.
 The cowl of his cloak hid much of his face.
 “Come, brother,” one of the elves said.
 “It is the one who protected them from our arrows.”
 The other nodded, took up his sword, and charged.

The guard in his hands was thrashing and spasming in unspeakable pain.
 As the guard collapsed to the ground, Rodregas fell with him.
 He tried to once more roll to the side, struggling away from a potential final stroke.
 Rodregas’ face was covered in gore and blood.
 It was hard for him to see.
 He struggled back up, but fell, then Rodregas felt a presence to his right.
 It was too small to be Doi’van and Rodregas staggered over reaching for him, determined to take one final slaver with him.
 His wounded leg buckled again, and Rodregas tried to reach for the ground to slow his fall, but something was wrong with his arm and it did not move.
 For a split second he saw the ground coming up to hit him in the face.

Part of me was aware I should have been scared, but I was enjoying myself.
 Whatever pain I might receive didn’t factor; I had wanted to hurt this wicked little redhead since the first time I’d seen her, since her hand reached out seductively toward Chevelle and collected my ruby.
 My palms lit where they wrapped around her arms.
 I would finally burn her.
 She cocked one eyebrow at me.
 “Half fire fairy, silly.” And I flew through the air to land with a heavy thump a few yards away.
 “Well, it was a little unconventional, but at least you’re thinking on your feet,” she mused, straightening the material of her skirt.
 And then she giggled as she realized I was, in fact, not on my feet.
 My body ached as I stood and my best skill was useless.
 I desperately wanted to ask her to show me the way, but my ego stubbornly refused.

He nodded.
 “It seems it may have taken your magic completely this time.” This time.
 I concentrated on keeping my head straight, to look like I was listening properly, acting properly.
 My attempt at concentration must have come across as anxiety.
 “You found a way to break their bonds before.
 You will again.” I nodded.
 My nose was itchy.
 I wiggled it.

I listened as their voices began, and then rose, clamorously discussing the news and what it could bring.

Despite the paramount concern raised by the persis tence of high rates of unemployment in recent years, available data do not confirm a long-term trend towards rising rates of global unemployment.
 Prognosis for Employment in the Twenty-First Century
 Although it is difficult to make reliable employment projections based on past trends, we can say some things with a fair degree of certainty.
 In order to provide employment for every job seeker, the world needs to create approximately one billion new jobs during the next decade.
 This will require a job growth rate of more than 4 per cent per year compared to the less than 3 per cent achieved during the 1980s.
 About 95 per cent of the growth in the world labour force over the next 35 years will take place in developing countries.
 An additional 260 million people will enter the workforce during the 1990s.
 Employment in the East Asian economies is projected to grow by 37 per cent between 1990 and 2000, while the labour force will increase by only 17 per cent, leading to an increasing shortage of labour in the region.
 In contrast, employment growth is projected to lag behind labour force growth in South Asia, Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa.
 Although job growth has once again started in many OECD countries, economic growth alone will not be sufficient to bring down unemployment rates significantly, especially among youth and the long-term unemployed.

Employment In the Twenty-First century The overwhelming popular reaction to these measures has92m always0m been a complaint for greater bank reform and greater social empowerment, while ignoring long-term unemployment. However, this political habit is much more durable than fanciful, regardless92m of0m the context in which these measures take place, in the developed world. Bank92m reform0m is ad to a92m host0m of previous measures that have failed to generate much interest and lending rates, have had little92m impact0m on the economy, have limited impact on the

She was busy being excited about her upcoming trip.
 I didn’t share her enthusiasm, so I retired to my room and read more of the journal.
 There were many sad passages after the passing of the writer’s mother, though their bond didn’t seem traditional.
 It seemed more… formal.
 And there were many complaints about the additional workload, both with the castle duties—which were described in more detail—and her training.
 I couldn’t be sure how much time had passed without the entries being dated, but her mood had definitely shifted.

I wanted to turn and run away, but the quasi-dream from the night before was just barely vivid enough to keep me in the room.
 "Is that what you want?
 Not what's best for me, or what you think is best for me, but what you really want?"
 The silence seemed to stretch into hours before Alec finally shook his head.
 "Good, because I don't want to leave.
 You said last night that your life felt meaningless before I came here, well, mine was even worse.
 The only thing that's kept me sane has been your behind-the-scenes help.
 I want to stay with you.
 I want to be with you."
 Alec studied me for a moment longer, and then nodded, a short, choppy motion with little if any of his usual grace.

I stared at his mouth, wondering briefly what it might taste like.
 I felt a sharp pain and realized I was biting my lip.
 The thought made me giggle again, but Chevelle’s eyes shot to my face and all amusement ceased.
 He stroked my cheek lightly with the back of his hand.
 “Sleep.” And I did.
 My dreams were vivid.
 Crimson curls brushing my cheek and bouncing as a slender fairy danced across the floor, flitting her painted fingers.

 Our friend Kenny Neidermeyer's mom was a Spanish teacher who also volunteered with a Tijuana charity.
 Since June, four of us had been riding with her to Tijuana every Sunday to play a double-header for a ball team the charity sponsored.
 The Liga Municipal, Segunda Fuerza, held its games on a sandlot with a makeshift backstop and a couple of benches along each sideline, one for the players, one for the fans.
 Our teammates were mostly the older sons of squatter families whose homes, made of scraps of tin, wood, and cardboard, balanced on narrow ridges along the walls of the Cañon del Sol, which ran down off the mesa to the border.

 They were quiet for several minutes.

 She was going home.
 She was going to be with her family again.

Either I love you or I kill you.”
 Sparks rained down as he clanged his swords together.
 “Is that how you feel?” she asked.
 The tears in her eyes ran down her cheeks, not to be replaced by any more.
 “So be it.” She took up her staff and held it defensively.
 “You are a fool, Harruq.
 May you die as one.”
 Harruq charged, his black blades gleaming.
 Every nagging doubt, every tiny part screaming for him to sheath his blades, he channeled into his mindless rage.
 His swords hacked chunks out of the staff, which held together only by Aurelia’s powerful enchantments.

I hoped I looked appropriately abashed.
 As I finished the second serving, he stepped closer to sit on the misshapen rock that rose through the earth beside me.
 He held his hand wide and a canteen flew up from a pile of things on the other side of the fire.
 He passed it to me, and I tilted it back, expecting cool water.
 I almost choked when warm wine hit my throat.
 He leaned forward to get a better look at me as I lowered the container.
 He looked as if he thought I might spook, otherwise I guessed he had plenty to say hidden beneath that smirk.
 It didn’t stop him from moving uncomfortably close, though, or eyeing me with what I was certain was the same look I’d just given my meal.
 I cleared my throat, thinking I’d made my sense of discomfort clear when he started to move, but he only stood, which brought him even closer.
 Well, parts of him.

The sight gave me strength, or courage, or blinding stupidity.
 I didn’t know, but I went with it with everything I had.
 I was trapped against the wall, unable to move, but there was one thing I could do.
 The sun broke through the clouds and I saw precisely what I needed.
 A shadow crossed the ground in front of us, a hawk flying overhead.
 The corner of my mouth pulled up in a smile as I closed my eyes to join him.
 The scene from above was just as incomprehensible.
 I focused on one thing at a time.
 Directly below me, I saw Grey.
 He was caught, wrapped in vines as my own body was.

One of the men poked it in the side with the butt of his sword and the dragon grunted in pain.
 I looked over my shoulder at Emily.
 She looked like she was about to start crying any second.
 Seth drew his sword and crouched down.
 He shuffled forward and motioned for us to follow.
 We slid through the trees as quietly as we could.
 I kept my eye on the faery men, waiting for one of them to turn around and notice us hiding in the trees.
 I ducked behind a tree and looked over just in time to see Emily trip and fall out of her bush.
 The faery and dwarves looked at her in surprise.
 I guess they’ve never seen a teenage half-ling girl fall out of a bush before.

“Does the orcie want some money?” one of the guards asked.
 He jabbed his elbow into the soldier next to him as both laughed in Harruq’s face.
 “Just want some work,” he grumbled, his deep voice almost impossible to understand.
 “Head around back,” one told him.
 “Alvrik will be waiting.”
 “That’d be west,” said the same rude guard.
 “You know which way west is, right?”
 Harruq’s hands opened and closed as he imagined his swords within them, ready to butcher for blood while the soldier proceeded to say the word ‘west’ as long and drawn out as possible.
 “Thanks,” he mumbled and hurried off.

The smile on his face seemed to say all kinds of things.
 I'm sorry I can't come over and talk.
 They all really depend on me.
 This whole thing with Jasmin is really crazy; we've got to figure out how best to handle it.
 Maybe it really said all of those things, or maybe I was completely deluded, but it was definitely a smile.
 That alone was enough to make my heart skip a beat, and send a warm tingly feeling lapping through me like a wave of distilled happiness.
 I was halfway through History before I realized there'd been something odd about the discussion at Brandon's table.
 Luckily, Mr. Simms started out the class in usual form.

Finally Rodregas turned to Jordaan and said, “Imeralda is right and I apologize for our anger.
 It is misplaced.
 My life and the life of my friend are well worth the price and we are in your debt.” At Rodregas’ words Jordaan simply nodded and then stepped into the trees, disappearing as the Nymphs had a habit of doing when in nature.
 “I had better go apologize to Imeralda,” said Rodregas.
 “You should wait a while and let her rage cool first,” suggested Doi’van slowly.
 He spoke as one who was very familiar with rage.
 Rodregas realized that Doi’van was probably right so he sat back and tried to think of the right words to speak when the timing was better.
 Unfortunately when Rodregas did speak to Imeralda his explanations and apology were not well received.
 She listened but seemed to have little sympathy.

Officer Mike “Mooncalf” Milton, one of the arresting officers, recalls to this day how polite Buddy and the band were as they were being ushered into police cars while the mob roared.
 “Buddy Gardner was a gentleman in a jerk business,” Officer Milton remembers.
 This mildness, this Southern gentleman perception, follows Buddy to this day.
 It’s hard to find someone to speak ill of him, even those he later abandoned or stepped on on his way to the top.
 He is often compared to courtly though dipsomaniacal photographer Bill Eggleston, a friend of Buddy’s from those acme days.
 The cover photograph of Black Lung’s Pepper Records album, Turntable Poison, is an unaccredited Eggleston photograph.
 (It is, of course, a weathered Sinclair sign, imbued with the enchantment Mr. Eggleston brought to all his work, a divergence quite inexplicable.)
 Buddy was loved, revered.
 He was not held to the same rules as everyone else.

 Deeper in the forest, Aurelia stepped out of a glowing blue portal.
 An elf waited there, an ornate bow slung across his back.
 “So do you think it could be him?” he asked her.
 “Perhaps,” Aurelia said.
 “I think it’s in him.
 Something is wrong, though.
 He’s too light hearted, too free.”
 “What does that mean?” the other elf asked, his fingers twitching at the string of his bow.

A song reminds me of 1 John 3:23, “This is his commandment, to believe in the name of his son, Jesus, and to love one another as he commanded us.” Again I think about the power of a single word to change us, and redirect our lives, and perhaps give us the ability to change others and the world.
 But I suspect it’s not likely to do so unless we stop and wrestle with its meanings.
 In an essay on writing short stories, Andre Dubus advised that when we get stuck, instead of stopping or attempting to go forward, we should try going deeper.
 On this trip, I have attempted to deepen my understanding of the word “adore.” Now I’m trying to do the same with some words in John’s admonition, because I feel my mind or the Spirit telling me that everything we need to know to live in goodness and beauty may be contained in those few lines.
 John tells us to “believe in” the name of the Son.
 While at a glance this could be taken to mean we should simply believe that Jesus existed, it doesn’t.
 Because “believe in” denotes more than credulity.
 “Believe in” means to fully trust.
 And here we’re not called to believe in “Him” but to believe in His name.
 As “name” in the Biblical context refers to character, John is calling us to fully trust in the character of Jesus Christ.

 He rubbed some on his legs and then stripped off his shirt.

 You two enjoy all of that math, and I'll see you tomorrow morning.
 Maybe you'll even wait for me at your house this time."
 It unsettled me a little that such a simple statement could cause industrial-sized butterflies to spontaneously appear in my stomach, so I tried to push the thought out of my mind.

 Mrs. Campbell stopped by for a few minutes, obviously checking to make sure that I was over my aberrant behavior from yesterday.

She was also much more fragile than either Doi’van or Rodregas; a blow that would only stun the two of them would shatter her.

 Laura's Birthday
 First period Monday, I got called to Mrs. Bole’s office.
 I knocked, stepped in, and found her slumped over her desk.
 Though she was big and hearty, today she looked undone, like a visitor to Auschwitz.
 “Sit down, Kenneth.” “What’d I do?” “It’s about Eric.” Studying her mournful eyes, I eased myself into the chair.
 “Yeah?” “They crashed.” My heart stopped and I gave up breathing.
 “Eric?” I gasped.

"I don't know--maybe.
 Anyone that thinks Minnesota is the east instead of the Midwest can't really be relied upon to remember important things like appointments."
 I could feel myself blushing again as I pulled free and fled into the house with a single wave goodbye.
 Normally I wasn't flirtatious.
 Heck, I hardly knew the meaning of the word, but something about Brandon turned it all into a harmless game.
 A game with rules that were nearly comprehensible for a change.
 One where there was very little to lose and an undreamed-of potential for achieving amazing things.
 As soon as the door was shut I ran to the window and hid behind the blinds, watching as the black Mustang drove up our lane.
 Overcome by the sudden urge to giggle, I ran upstairs looking for my mom.
 I made it all the way to her door before remembering the Jeep hadn't been downstairs.

The Immortalists should not be interested in either.

 “Both really, I did not understand why they wanted me.
 I thought if you were Hellborn you were safe from the Immortalists,” Doi’van replied, “They would cut me to see how fast I would heal and do tests where they were clearly testing my physical side.
 They also seemed just as excited about my magical power, which I was surprised by.
 It was the first time I was aware that I had strong magic.” Doi’van paused then added, “They seem to think I was a great catch, and I think Taiga wanted a lot of money for me.
 The thing is, the Beast Master Taiga kept me in a distant cell.
 Though he had me for two years, he only showed me to others for sale a handful of times.” “You are suggesting that Taiga, and in turn Ravenhurr, were breaking ‘The One Law?’” asked Jordaan.

“Fly back to the others, Sonowin, we will battle this day.” The horse snorted, making Dieredon laugh.
 “No, I am sure you won’t be hurt.” Sonowin banked, giving the elf one last view of the battle before soaring east to where the rest of the Quellan elves waited atop their magnificent pegasi.
 His horse neighed a quick question, one Dieredon wished he could laugh at.
 “Everyone can be killed,” he said, tying his hair behind his head.
 “And no, I have no plans of breaking my ribs again.”
 The horse made an interesting little noise, one Dieredon had long ago learned was laughter.

Job growth has been quite rapid in the developing countries over the last forty years, more than doubling total employment.
 The single most important factor behind rising numbers of unemployed persons and increasing absolute numbers of families below the poverty line in developing countries has been the 2.4-fold expansion of population in the Third World, and more than doubling of the economically active population since 1950, which have resulted in a 4 per cent decline in the overall employment rate.
 Population growth rates continue to fall steadily in most countries, with the exception of Africa, providing an opportu nity for economic growth and job growth to catch up with the population explosion of recent decades.
 Along with rapid quantitative job growth, the global economy has achieved dramatic qualitative gains in the nature of employment.
 During recent decades, there has also been a marked movement away from subsistence level manual occupations, primarily in agriculture, to more skilled and remunerative forms of employment.
 Worldwide, the percentage of the work force engaged in agriculture has fallen by 24 per cent since 1950, from 67 to 51 per cent.
 Unemployment is of growing concern today primarily because population has expanded in recent decades even faster than job creation and because a larger percentage of the population, principally women, seek employment now than at any time in the past.
 The shortages of jobs and the resulting poverty represent the most pressing social problem in the world today.
 But viewed in historical perspective, it is clear that substantial progress has been made during the post-war period, making humanity as a whole more prosperous than at any previous period in recorded history.
 Over the past five decades, global GDP has multiplied seven-fold.

Maybe it was the natural high I got simply from being around him.
 Alec's smile was brief, but it felt like the first one I'd seen since he'd been forced to save me.
 I couldn't blame him for being worried about how this was going to further strain already tense relations with Brandon's pack.
 Still, the transforming expression made me realize just how badly I'd missed his other face, the one that wasn't stern and serious all of the time.
 "No, you're not bothering me in the slightest.
 Jasmin or Isaac either one could easily keep watch.
 Our sense of smell and hearing are good enough that it's all but impossible for even other wolves to catch us unawares.

It opened its huge wings and launched itself into the air.
 If you’re thinking of trying dragon riding as a hobby, I wouldn’t.
 I fell backwards and landed on Seth who snapped at me to get off.
 I couldn’t move because we were still going up and if you paid attention in science class, this is usually when you can’t move.
 It’s called gravity.
 The dragon righted itself and I scrambled back into sitting position.
 We were gliding high up in the eerie sky and the view was actually beautiful.
 The trees looked like an endless sea of lush green and the sun peeked out from behind the clouds.
 I felt the urge to hold my arms out like they do in those movies so I could feel the wind on my arms.

I’d only used my power to light candles and lanterns.
 I’d had no idea I could produce such a vicious plume of flames.
 I looked to Chevelle.
 “Yes,” he exalted.
 He raised his arms above his head to construct a massive circle of blazing heat.
 When his eyes returned to mine, he smiled.
 He liked playing with fire.
 And then he shoved the fireball toward me with frightening speed.
 I threw both hands in front of me, palms out, and forced the largest mass I could in response.
 Chevelle flicked his wrist and the flame dodged up and angled back toward me.

Seth gave me a small nod, signaling me to start telling them about my dream.
 “Listen guys, I had a dream,” I said and repeated my dream again, minus the part about Seth.
 Emily and Jason listened to every word I said.
 When I got to the part about Kojas, Emily's mouth made a small O and Jason's eyes widened.
 My voice shook as I recalled the dwarf's dead body.
 “That's awful!” Emily said, her voice shaking.
 She hopped over and gave me a small embrace.
 “I'm sorry you had to see that.” “Uh...thanks Emily,” I said and allowed myself to be hugged.
 She bounced back over to Jason's side and waited for me to continue but there was nothing else to say.
 I had told her everything I needed to tell her.

Rachel was waiting for us in a luxuriously-furnished sitting room.
 "Mother's been asking for you, Alec.
 I told her you'd be back soon, but she's worried."
 "I suppose this is a good opportunity to introduce Adriana."
 For the first time since I'd found out about Alec's secret, Rachel was looking uncertain.
 She was suddenly the old Rachel I knew from school instead of the confident young woman who'd helped face down three terrifying shape shifters intent on sending me back to Brandon.
 "Are you sure, Alec?
 I could go help her get settled into the Lilac Room."
 Alec's smile was gentle.
 It reminded me of how Mom looked when I offered to take care of some especially undesirable duty she'd been procrastinating.

He must despise me.
 That was why he’d become my watcher.
 He gave a curt nod at my reaction, his head still dipped as he walked away.
 I wanted to speak but the words choked me.
 I wrapped myself tighter into the cloak as Chevelle constructed a hasty shelter.
 I was his responsibility, but surely he loathed me.
 How could he not?
 I thought back to the scenarios I had envisioned after the memories of my mother being killed came back to me… what I would do to those men if I were to ever find them.
 Now I remembered the truth.

“Just a dream.” A few chuckles moved through the crowd.

I had to catch that line of thought before it spiraled out of control; I concentrated on finding something small.
 A tiny pebble lay on the ground at my feet.
 I focused on it hard, willing it to rise.

 He watched me, his serene mask back in place.
 “Do you need motivation?” I was afraid of the kind of motivation he’d provide, remembering the fireballs flying at me in the meadow.
 “No.” My answer was too quick, and he laughed.

 You never know when or if the perfect person will appear.
 The fateful night I set eyes on her set in motion everything that would happen to me for the rest of my life.

 This was their chance for Doi’van, and he would get a second chance if needed.
 He looked over at the other two.
 Once Rodregas had turned around from the lion, Doi’van started to walk between the pedestals joining Imeralda at looking around.
 He stood in front of the great six-legged stallion, the kind of steed the Gods themselves ride, and then walked over to the Great White Stag of the forest and then to the giant eagle that guarded the Celestial sky.
 It was a sight to take the breath from any mortal, a score of beasts that appeared to have been taken right from the heavens.
 “How were the greater sigils created?” Rodregas wondered.
 While the leaser sigils appeared to be simple sculpture empowered by magic, these truly appeared real.
 Yet what magic could capture such powerful beasts for the use of creating sigils?
 Had the greater sigils been gifts to mortals from the Gods themselves?

Not in the respectful ‘a lady entered the room’ way, but in a way that led me to believe he wasn’t happy to have me, or anyone, find him there.
 He held a long staff, gripped so tightly his knuckles whitened, and he was dressed in casual traveling clothes that didn’t seem to fit his posture.
 I found myself questioning whether it were a disguise, and then I chastised myself for wandering around in ridiculous thoughts so often.
 They were watching me.
 Cursed brain fog.
 I stood there for a moment, unsure if I should leave the room after I had so obviously interrupted or pretend I had a mission and make my way to Ruby’s room.
 I clearly wasn’t welcome there.
 Neither spoke, so I lowered my gaze to the floor, taking the shortest route to Ruby’s door and closing it hastily behind me.

The scolding actually hadn't been that bad, almost like disguised praise.
 Britney looked like she was hoping for something similar, but Mrs. Campbell's expression quickly dashed that idea.
 "You on the other hand definitely need to spend every night at the math lab.
 Your homework was incomplete, and of the problems you bothered to attempt, you didn't do a single one correctly.
 Britney, you're headed towards a failing grade, and while you might not care, your father most certainly does.
 Make my class a priority, or I'll stop in for a checkup and let slip just how poorly you're doing to dear old Dad, and then you'll find yourself riding the bus to school."
 It was a vicious threat, but one almost guaranteed to have an effect.
 Britney most definitely didn't want to be stuck riding the bus with all of the junior high kids and other assorted 'losers'.
 Her mouth opened and closed several times and then she nodded and fled the classroom.
 When I finally caught up with her she'd recovered enough to complain, but there was a breathless nature to her voice that told me she wouldn't be skipping the math lab for a little while.

 Johnny, you’ve never had a date in your life, and some times I doubt that you ever will.
 And Gene, well I don’t know where to start with you, the last time you went out with someone was during that week that you thought you might be gay.
 Now I’m not an experienced judge of what makes another guy attractive, but I would have to say that your date was the single ugliest man I’ve ever seen in my life.

Rodregas had been trying to get him alone, where he could kill him without blame, for years.
 Rodregas went over and reached down to grab the bottom of the heavily made bed, and almost fell over when the bed lifted far more easily than expected.
 The sound of wood screeched as weight switched to the back legs of the bed and then moved at his awkward action, and the top of the columns smashed against the plaster ceiling.
 Rodregas carefully lowered the bed back down; as the bed settled back to the floor he was covered by a light dusting of plaster from the damaged ceiling.
 Was Rodregas really that strong?
 Or was the bed just lighter than it looked?
 He went back over to the trunk and lifted it up; it to went up too easily and felt strangely light.
 Next he went over the dresser.
 Rodregas had known that the physical essence of the celestial lion was in his body and that all of his physical attributes would be improved, but the strength of the Immortalist was not common knowledge; you just heard that they were long lived and never got sick.

 He was riding too fast again and I was not looking forward to the day, sure it would be worse than the already miserable morning.
 I rode up beside him, planning a snide remark about the trick, but was distracted by a black stone in his hand.

While we have argued against pressure on food-deficit developing countries to reduce their comparatively low-level usage of mineral fertilizers and chemical pesticides, empirical studies sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences and the Department of Agriculture in the USA found strong evidence, long resisted by scientists and commercial farmers in the West, that chemical-free farming can be as productive and cost-effective as chemical-based methods.
 Industrial countries that offer subsidies to encourage chemical usage should modify their policies to provide active incentives for the use of chemical-free methods instead.
 During the last ten years, Indonesia has succeeded in bringing down the consumption of chemical pesticides without adversely affecting grain production through the nationwide adoption of integrated pest management systems for food crop protection.
 India has launched a massive national training programme to popularize bio logical methods of pest control, which can reduce the consumption and cost of chemical pesticides by 50 to 75 per cent.
 Public education programmes of this type are needed at the national and international level to disseminate information about chemical-free methods to producers and to educate consumers in developed and developing countries about both the health and environmental benefits of organically grown produce.
 9.Inland aquaculture.
 Depletion of deep sea fishery resources has resulted in a significant decline in world harvests from the sea.
 Proven technology is available for substantially replacing sea-grown fish with fresh or salt water pond-grown varieties.
 The new intensive and semi-intensive methods of cultivation can generate yields 10 to 100 times higher than traditional extensive methods.
 Due to the warmer climate and lower labour costs of the developing world, inland aquaculture can become a major stimulus to rural employment, incomes, processing industries and exports.

 A month later he'd read of her engagement to another man.
 He'd actually proposed to Kim, but once she had the ring, all she'd wanted to talk about was what pieces she was going to buy to refurnish the house and at which resorts they were going to spend their summers and how much of his money was in the bank and how much in land investments.

Love has a mind of its own.
 Our marriage was already rocky when we decided to go for another kid.
 Laura wanted another and I agreed, though a counselor we tried working with contended that until we had resolved certain issues, another child would hardly be practical.
 But practicality ranks at the bottom of my aptitude profile, just below biology and basketball.
 We were vagabonds, back then.
 When Darcy was two months old we moved to Iowa for my gradual school (for a definition of "gradual" see or read The World According to Garp, by John Irving who was my first professor there).
 When Cody was two months old, we moved to Arizona for a teaching job I was offered.
 Two years later, we moved to Chico, California for a job with more security, which we craved on account of the little ones.
 But security only exists as a craving.
 Even though the college in Chico gave me tenure, so they couldn’t have fired me unless I kidnapped the president or his wife or daughter, I had to leave it behind because Laura and I split apart and my kids, whom I loved more than life, health, art or anything, went to live in San Diego.

Nothing we studied touched on the histories of those clans.
 Nothing of his histories, nothing of mine.
 But conversation had become easy as soon as I had spoken that first word, as soon as I had said his name and he’d smiled in return.
 I found myself leaning toward him as he spoke, actually paying attention in places; he had a pleasant voice and an unusual dialect.
 He wove histories as if they were stories of his childhood friends instead of useless facts, and I became enthralled.
 It felt as if we were alone there in the quiet corner of the third level, the occasional murmur below and whisper of flipping pages the only other sound in the dim setting.
 A small knothole made a window in the wall across from me and some light from the cloudy day occasionally came through, putting Chevelle’s face in shade.

 We used to try to work up a version of “The Sun Also Rises” because I could make my voice sound like his raspy delivery—likewise Sky Saxon of The Seeds.
 Which is why “Can’t Seem to Make Her Mine” shows up on the bootleg, also.
 A better version of it, than “Sun”—actually part studio, part live, if you can dig that.
 At least, whoever put the fucker together had some chops, knew a thing or two—it’s a fairly seamless melding of two different versions of the song, incorporating a blistering solo I did on it live with a somewhat coherent rendering we put down at Ardent.
 “Can’t Seem to Make Her Mine” should have been huge for The Seeds, yet it only charted, barely.
 I think.
 So, most people think they only did “Pushin’ Too Hard.”  Their first album is actually really kick-ass, better than the Stones, if you ask me, better than 12 X 5, better than Out of Our Heads.

I'd never been invited to any parties, let alone cool ones.
 I'd never felt the lack too strongly, but I smiled and let Britney keep talking until Mr. Whethers realized it was time to start class.
 I quickly gathered we'd be reading Wuthering Heights, a prospect that both elated and disappointed me.
 After seeing how far behind I was already in Biology, it was nice to know we'd be working on something I'd already been through twice.
 On the other hand I hadn't liked the novel the first time I'd read it, and when I'd gritted my teeth and sat down for a second attempt I'd found I liked it even less.
 Maybe I just lacked the maturity to appreciate Bronte's so-called masterpiece, but I couldn't stand that her characters were almost all really nasty people.
 I wondered what else we'd be reading.
 I could always ask Britney, but the odds of her knowing anything useful seemed pretty slim.
 When the bell finally released us from an analysis of Heathcliff's early depravity, Britney asked what my next class was.

 FOOD SECURITY IN AFRICA
 The present prognosis for Africa resembles the pessimistic assessment of Asia in the 1960s that projected most Asians would face starvation in the 1970s.
 Over the past two decades, total food production in Africa has grown at exactly the same rate as for the world as a whole, but high levels of population growth have resulted in declining availability of food per capita in many countries, particularly in the sub-Saharan region.
 This suggests that a grim outcome is not inevitable, if concerted action is taken now.
 Several factors have impeded achievement of higher agricultural growth rates in the region: political instability and civil unrest, poor macro-economic and agricultural policies, drought, and physical difficulties in farming in some areas.
 The ravages of war have had the most devastating effect, but inadequate and counter-productive policies have also had a major impact.
 Low mandated prices for agricultural products have acted as a disincentive to producers.
 State control of farm support systems, including marketing, transportation and input supply, is highly bureaucratic, inefficient, and, often, corrupt.

 Panic was taking me when she laid a hand on my shoulder and leaned forward.
 I expected her to calm me, explain it would come back, it would all be okay.
 Glitter was in the air before I could stop her.
 By the time Chevelle returned, I was loopy with it.
 He and Ruby sat facing me.
 She must have filled him in on my problem.
 I resisted the urge to touch him.

My stomach tightened, but I found myself getting up and heading toward the village, regardless of the consequence.
 I argued with that impulsive part of me the entire way to town.

 “Ruby dear, won’t you allow us to partake?” “Speak for yourself,” Anvil cracked from across the fire, “last time I lost a bit of tongue.” I cringed and remembered my dream.
 I thought I could still smell burning flesh.
 Ruby laughed.
 “Ah, well, I suppose just this once.” Grey sat, rough brown boots resting among the stone, and she leaned over him as if for a kiss.
 Her lips stopped just short of his, their eyes connecting as a glint of firelight caught the shimmer and Grey breathed it in.

I'm afraid this class builds on itself, so I'll be testing you on everything we've covered in the past month.
 I'm sure you've got a full class load, but we haven't gotten into anything truly difficult yet.
 The sooner we get you caught up, the better off you'll be.
 Shall we say a month from today?"
 The prospect of trying to catch up, all the while needing to master new material and deal with a full schedule of other classes, was too much.
 I felt tears rising to the surface even as my heartbeat sped up to near-panic attack levels.
 That was the last thing I needed, but I could only fight off so many worries at once, and I was quickly approaching my limits.

It lasted about a year.
 She was there when we recorded some of our first songs, I remember that.
 She loved, uh, “Hayley Mill’s Underpants.”  For some reason, she thought that was her song.

 And, as a young man, who appreciated a young woman who loved lingerie, well, we had some fiery times.

I walked down the softened earth to where the water had pooled and knelt, leaning over to splash my face.
 Panic shot through me as someone looked back at me.
 I nearly bolted upright, planning to flee, but caught myself.
 The woman in the reflection was me.
 That was my dark hair and flushed skin.
 Cautiously leaning over the pool once more, I convinced myself it was only the dark water, a trick of light and shadow.
 My eyes were not that green, my hair not black.

He came to sit across from me and I flinched, expecting another attack.
 He smiled.
 “Well, at least you’re anticipating assault.” I didn’t have the energy for casual banter, but I did manage to glare at him.
 He pointed northeast.
 “The village is a few hours’ ride from here.” He retrieved a fresh set of clothes from his pack and handed it across to me.
 “Go ahead and get cleaned up.
 I’ll be back in a few moments.” I tried to pull myself together as he strode away, but I felt so drained.
 I stood, easing my clothes off, soiled and tattered from the days of batterings.
 The damage on my bare skin was minimal.

 I don’t want any problems, and I don’t want to see any weapons.
 Drug dealing has never been an honorable profession, so anything could happen.
 Though I have never met the buyer, I have been assured by his girlfriend that he will have the money and the deal will take only a few minutes.

I love her so much, and I always return in my mind to the day I met her and then everything is in perspective and nothing else matters but our love.
 Chapter 12: Who’s Your Daddy Lisa and I discovered “we” were pregnant about four months into our marriage.
 Even though we had not planned to start a family so early, we were thrilled, excited and anxious at the thought of creating a life conceived by the two of us.
 After passing out during the movie at the birthing class, (yes, really!)
 I was not convinced I was going to be the pillar of strength my wife would need during the birth of our child (and neither was Lisa).
 I remember the movie; it was titled “The Brazilian Squatting Method.” Until then, The Exorcist was the scariest movie I had ever seen, and this beat it hands down.
 I excused myself from the room—which was filled with couples huddled together on little mats on the ground—as I began to pass out.
 I headed down the hall towards the men’s restroom and I felt myself weakening with every step.
 I pushed on the door and then the next thing I knew, I was waking up on the floor with the restroom door against my side, propping it open like a bag of sand, half of my body in the restroom and half out in the hall.
 After splashing some water in my face I returned as if nothing had happened, but I knew and I suspected that Lisa did too.

During my college years, I would frequently get waylaid by too-friendly people.
 I must’ve looked pagan or drug addled.
 Usually they ran in twos.
 While one of them smiled, the other would ask, “Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?” “Yep,” I would say, and either stay and observe their perplexed surprise, or excuse myself before they could ask, “What church do you attend?” and then pitch theirs to me when I said I don’t, which was usually the case.
 The only effective evangelist I encountered in those days was Tony Tarantino, a lanky Jesus freak with frizzy red hair and an expression both bewildered and wise.
 I picked him up hitchhiking.
 He settled into the seat, set his Bible on his lap, stared at me for a minute and asked, “Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?” “Yep,” I said, and readied myself to field the standard subsequent questions.
 Tony said, “Oh.
 Good.” A week later, he was leading a Bible study at our house.

I hoped I looked appropriately abashed.
 As I finished the second serving, he stepped closer to sit on the misshapen rock that rose through the earth beside me.
 He held his hand wide and a canteen flew up from a pile of things on the other side of the fire.
 He passed it to me, and I tilted it back, expecting cool water.
 I almost choked when warm wine hit my throat.
 He leaned forward to get a better look at me as I lowered the container.
 He looked as if he thought I might spook, otherwise I guessed he had plenty to say hidden beneath that smirk.
 It didn’t stop him from moving uncomfortably close, though, or eyeing me with what I was certain was the same look I’d just given my meal.
 I cleared my throat, thinking I’d made my sense of discomfort clear when he started to move, but he only stood, which brought him even closer.

“Gentleman, please,” said Jordaan.
 “You must have understood that this village took a great risk in taking you, and those you rescued, in.
 The only way Imeralda was able to get their support was to offer the bounty of the Immortal Guard’s equipment.” As if called from Jordaan’s words, Imeralda landed in the clearing, seemingly leaping from one of the nearby trees.
 She looked a bit out of breath, like she had sprinted at a run to the Dwello.
 She took a quick look at Doi’van and Rodregas and paled.
 Doi’van’s eyes were literally glowing red and he was tossing his horned head with his wild black hair flying.
 Imeralda had not seen him in such a mood before, not even during the battle with the slave caravan.
 Imeralda thought that Rodregas was only marginally better.
 The muscles of his neck and shoulders were bunched up and she could feel his anger through her bond with him.
 But he was also breathing deeply and through the bond she knew he was trying to control himself.

“How long will we be riding?” I wasn’t specific in my question, not wanting to reveal I had no idea where we were headed.
 If he’d been under the false impression he’d had to take me, I wasn’t about to mess that up only to be dragged back to the village.
 Especially after everything that had happened.
 My horse quickened his pace to ride alongside his and I made a mental note to learn how to control the horse on my own.
 The constricted path forced us close together, our stirrups and legs brushing as we rode.
 Chevelle nodded at my hand and I held it out, palm up.
 Chevelle indicated a spot on one of the mountains.
 “We are here.” I tried not to let my disappointment show.
 The information would’ve only helped if I’d known where I started on the map or its endpoint.

Rodregas knew enough of magic to understand that the purpose of this circle was to keep out unwanted magical influences.
 They could interfere with the spell casting inside the circle.
 Also, the circle would hold in any magical forces inside which someone wanted to store or manipulate.
 Inside the large circle were four smaller circles.
 Rodregas’ eyes immediately went to the one on the north side made of blue sand, where inside sigils made of a yellow waxy substance laid a giant lion.
 This was not a normal lion such as those found in the nearby forest, but a giant beast.
 Ravenhurr had been lucky indeed.
 He had been able to buy several Dire Cats from the Immortalist Guild dealer Taiga.
 With magic, he caused them to go into heat.
 It was known to be very difficult to affect Dire beasts with magic, and his success had shown his power and accomplishment as a mage.

The weight of blood was on his shoulders, and who was he to fight against it?
 “I’m sorry if I’m weak,” Harruq whispered to his sleeping brother.
 “I can’t be like you.
 I can’t be strong like you…”
 The half-orc buckled the old pair of swords next to the gleaming black blades on his belt.
 He then gently took his brother into his arms and carried him back to town.
 The weight of his brother in his hands was a feather compared to the burden on his heart.

The ratio of growth of foodgrain production to population growth has entered into a period of decline over the past decade – increasing at just one per cent per year compared to three per cent during the previous two decades.
 There is a similar trend for other staple crops and meat.
 For fish, there has actually been a net decline of seven per cent in per capita world production.
 To a large extent, this slowdown is the result of slower growth in demand, especially in industrial countries, under lining the fact that food security is predominantly an economic problem rather than a technological one.
 But the decline in the growth of global agricultural productivity over the past decade is also attributable to a variety of political, economic and environmental factors.
 Political priority
 After the Second World War, developing countries that had suffered from recurring famine in early periods struggled to increase food production as an urgent national priority to keep up with surging population growth and spiralling demand for food.
 India’s Green Revolution was spurred by the imminent threat of severe famine in the mid-1960s.
 China was compelled to produce more food by the loss of perhaps as many as 30 or 40 million lives to famine in the late 1950s.
 But the very motive which stimulated these achievements moderated them as well.

By contrast, the forests of Latin92m America0m began from felling and turned into a life-year for farmers if harvest wasn’t ready and and led to a similar collapse.

Although it is difficult to make reliable employment projections based on past trends, we can say some things with a fair degree of certainty.
 In order to provide employment for every job seeker, the world needs to create approximately one billion new jobs during the next decade.
 This will require a job growth rate of more than 4 per cent per year compared to the less than 3 per cent achieved during the 1980s.
 About 95 per cent of the growth in the world labour force over the next 35 years will take place in developing countries.
 An additional 260 million people will enter the workforce during the 1990s.
 Employment in the East Asian economies is projected to grow by 37 per cent between 1990 and 2000, while the labour force will increase by only 17 per cent, leading to an increasing shortage of labour in the region.
 In contrast, employment growth is projected to lag behind labour force growth in South Asia, Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa.
 Although job growth has once again started in many OECD countries, economic growth alone will not be sufficient to bring down unemployment rates significantly, especially among youth and the long-term unemployed.
 Changes in values, attitudes, structures and policies will be necessary.
 Unless concerted action steps are taken, global unemployment will increase by 130 million during the 1990s.

I could remember my dreams, the wind and fire surrounding my mother.
 But the memories that came back when I woke from those vivid nightmares were dull.
 The harder I clutched at them, the more they drew away.
 When recognition dawned, I leapt from the rock, cursing Chevelle.
 He turned to me as I yelled, “Give it back!” He didn’t appear to know what I was talking about, but I was so angry I was having trouble forming the demand.
 “Give my memories, my mind back!” His confusion cleared, but Chevelle didn’t offer a response.
 The fire in me itched to burn him.
 I seethed.
 “Unbind my thoughts.” “Freya.” His voice was smooth.
 “You don’t understand.” I fumed, “Well, I’m sure that has nothing to do with you rummaging around in there.” He shook his head and his complete lack of agitation caused me to take pause.

And I got bullied relentlessly.
 Pushed to the ground, laughed at when I tried to join in during P.E..
 I started dreading recess, you know.
 I just wanted to stay inside and read or write songs in my looseleaf notebook.
 I hated school, hated those bullies—hell, I still do, I hate bullying—but music was my out, or, I guess my in.
 When I started playing guitar at the school, on the playground, at the talent shows—where I always won, man, every fucking time—I was something else.
 I was no longer a weeny.
 I was talented.
 I found one other thing you could be and get some attention, the kind of attention you wanted, from girls, from the popular set.
 I mean, I could say I didn’t give a fuck what anyone thought, but you do when you’re becoming pubic, right.

Despite looking a little weary, she looked like she could be very attractive if she tried.
 As I looked at her, I felt sorry for her because I knew she was about the same age as my sons and I knew she was somebody’s daughter, somebody’s baby and I also knew the sordid details of her existence.
 She led me into a surprisingly clean bedroom that had a complete bedroom set and a mirrored closet door was beside the bed.
 She pointed me towards a chair in the corner of the room and told me I could get undressed and put my clothes on the chair.
 She excused herself, telling me that she was getting a towel to cover the bed where the massage would take place.
 I thought I could hear her whispering to someone in the apartment, but I only heard her voice.
 Now I was really wondering what I had walked in to.
 I labored to get my shoes off: A well placed moan and groan intended to prompt her curiosity.
 “Are you all right?” she asked, coming back into the room with a towel and spreading it flat onto the bed, then bending down and helping me untie my shoes.
 “I have back problems,” I said, standing to remove my dress shirt, exposing the back brace which I removed with angst.

It was like the air had become thick, and although the fine strands of hair on the back of my neck hadn't moved, it felt like they should be standing on end.
 I heard indistinct sobbing, and then the voice returned and made me shiver.
 The sensation started somewhere on my back, and traveled forward like it was clawing to get out of my face.
 "I know you're sorry, just like you were sorry before.
 Only I don't really believe you, so we're instituting a new policy.
 If I catch you sniffing around him again, I'll kill you.
 No questions asked."
 My pulse skyrocketed as the raw terror hit.
 I'd heard death threats a couple of times before.

 The night was hot and miserable when Velixar met the half-orc brothers and told them the news they had long waited to hear.
 “Ahrqur was successful, and in ways beyond what I could have hoped for,” he told them, joy dancing in his features.

“Really Jazell?” Emily hissed from behind me.
 I turned my head to her.
 “Well, you come up with something to top that and we’ll see how well you do.” “Nah, I’m good,” she said quickly.
 Kojas laughed again.
 Seriously, was this faery guy crazy or something?
 “You are mistaken,” he said.
 “I am cooler than you because I hold all the cards.” Then he turned to the army and yelled, “Attack!”

I might have run through the night and slept at day, but it made little sense to struggle out of fear.
 It didn’t stop me from seeking out a decent shelter before nightfall, though.
 Slowing my pace, I gave the surroundings more attention.
 The strangeness of the land was a little shocking, and I had to surrender the idea of finding a proper tree.
 But a half mile or so later, I came upon a suitable hollow in a low embankment guarded by the curling roots of a sycamore.
 It wasn’t a bad start, but I gathered some shrubbery to cover the entryway, the bitter stench of its sharp green leaves giving me a little more security—or at least the feeling of it.
 The sun hadn’t set when I’d finished lining the floor with vines, but I went ahead and settled in, sitting so I could see through an opening in the frond-covered entry.
 It was quiet, harder to fight the thoughts that were trying to creep in.
 I began to run songs through my head for distraction, mangling the lyrics and humming through the parts I couldn’t remember at all.
 My fingers tapped soundlessly into the dirt, until a flicker of movement just outside stopped me.

She plopped me down in the center of her bed and swung around to sit in front of me.
 My head was reeling from the spin as she smiled at me, waving her hands and bringing a plethora of bottles and canisters flying toward us to drop on the bed.
 I thought with disappointment that I hadn’t responded to her attack as Chevelle had taught me and laughed at the image in my head.
 Ruby gave me a genuine smile as she began twisting the lid on a small metal canister.
 “No mother to teach us the tricks of the trade,” she sighed as she leaned in.
 I jerked away from her, wanting to be angry about the comment.

 She mistook my reaction.

_As the vision faded, one last sight burned into Qurrah’s mind: it was he, dressed in deep robes of black, his eyes glowing a bloody crimson._
 “That was Veldaren,” Qurrah said as Velixar’s fingers pulled back.
 He felt awe and fear at the sight of the magnificent city ablaze.
 “I want all of Neldar to burn,” Velixar said, his deep voice rumbling.
 “Will you aid me?”
 Such a great request, a desire for destruction that most would hesitate before.
 For Qurrah, though, it was a fate he had long expected.
 It was within his blood, the cursed, the race of the ugly and the destructive.
 Yet it had been his elvish blood that had him banished.

It tried to change forms to avoid the knife's path but somehow my knife stabbed it anyway.
 It withered and then went still.

Asking Captain Poir to send up Adapt Korin had been totally unplanned.
 He had been dreaming of killing Korin for all the 18 years that he had served in the tower.
 The Sorcerer Ravenhurr had been an immoral monster that used those around him for his own selfish desires.
 But Adapt Korin was of a more casual evil; he never passed up the opportunity to hurt those around him, physically or emotionally.
 Ravenhurr had existed in the same body for the full eighteen years of Rodregas’ service, and was hundreds of years old.
 In all his years serving in the tower Ravenhurr had only tried to hold the ceremony three times, each time abandoning the attempt due to the lack of a celestial animal.
 A celestial animal was extremely rare, but required as part of the ceremony for Ravenhurr’s next step up in power.
 In contrast, his assistant, the Adapt Korin, had been going though bodies constantly.
 Worse, he seemed to take great delight in letting people know what fate awaited them.
 Rape and torture of the victims were common occurrences with Korin.

Imeralda reached out for one of the closest, but then stopped as her fingers touched them, as if a spark of lightning had hit her.
 Obviously, she could feel that same power Rodregas had.
 That was interesting.
 She then ran her hand from one to the next until she had touched all twelve books.
 Then, she looked up and her expression reminded Rodregas of some girl who had gotten the perfect mid winter gift that she had been dreaming of.
 “These are not books on magic,” she said.
 “These are Grimoires, several of them of great power.” “Really?” Rodregas said, “I was a squire who learned a little magic, but I really can’t say that I know the difference between a book of magic and a Grimoire.” Imeralda looked surprised and said, “Oh, you guys must depend on the oral tradition.
 That is a hard way to learn.
 The symbols and geometric figures that form a powerful spell are often too complex to learn from just the spoken word.” Rodregas cut in and clarified, “I mean, in the order we did read books on magic theory and history, but I never felt energy from them before.” Imeralda nodded, “Let me explain.

Her boots splashed in the melted snow again, and I sent the icy water racing up under the material of her skirt to her bare legs.
 Shock crossed her face and I hoped it would buy the time I needed.
 What now?
 The cold water had thrown her for no more than a fraction of a second, but it was enough time to right myself and execute one quick attack.
 I volleyed a nearby rock, which struck her in the back of the head and threw her balance off for another instant.
 I knew I was larger than her so I gritted my teeth and lunged, grabbing her as I tried to figure my next move.
 She raised her face and, when her eyes met mine, they narrowed.
 Part of me was aware I should have been scared, but I was enjoying myself.
 Whatever pain I might receive didn’t factor; I had wanted to hurt this wicked little redhead since the first time I’d seen her, since her hand reached out seductively toward Chevelle and collected my ruby.

Rodregas could not pronounce the ancient version of the Eastern Common language Ravenhurr was using, but he thought that he understood the gist of the meaning.
 Rodregas could not believe the man did not try to battle his way out.
 The captain and Dale were both large men but it would have been very difficult to keep such a gifted athlete in the circle, even with clubs, if he was determined to escape.
 However, he was young and clearly lacked battle experience.
 He seemed unsure of what to do.
 Then it was too late; the blue flames of the circle rose high, then inward, and engulfed him.
 The young man started to split in two.
 The physical man stood there, but as he watched, another ethereal version, the man’s spirit, his very non-corporal essence, was suddenly pulled from his body, and then whipped around and out of the burning circle.
 Rodregas was not sure, but as this ethereal version of the man was pulled apart, Rodregas thought he could see him screaming.
 Rodregas pulled his eyes away from the horrifying vision as the corporal man went from looking confused and unsure to having no expression at all, like an empty piece of meat.

I tried to catch up, but Alec chose that moment to look up and stare in our direction.
 He was quite a ways away, and his lovely eyes were covered by a pair of sunglasses, but I somehow knew he was looking at me.
 He handed Rachel a helmet but continued to look at us, at me, while she put it on.
 I was moving again, but my pulse sped up as Rachel grabbed a hold of her brother and swung her leg over the pillion seat on the bike.
 She seemed to see us for the first time as a cold chill arced down my back and the horizon started to vibrate.
 I managed to raise my hand in response to her wave, but it was an absent motion.
 My attention was still on Alec and his unwavering stare.
 Rachel leaned forward as if to say something to him, and he finally nodded and dropped the bike into gear.

The converse is also true.
 Historically, war and civil strife have been the single greatest cause of famines.
 In addition to destroying crops and food supplies, it disrupts food distribution through the use of sieges and blockades.
 In the past decade, war has had a greater impact on food supplies in Africa, particularly the Sahelian region, than have the severe droughts that periodically plague the continent.
 Freedom from hunger and political freedom go hand in hand.
 As subsistence agriculture and periodic famine were the economic foundations of monarchy and feudalism, the generation of agricultural surpluses that stimulated commercialism, and later industrialization, have formed the basis for the rise of democratic institutions.
 Greater freedom for individual action and ownership both stimulate and are supported by greater productivity in agriculture.
 Authoritarian government is frequently either the result or the cause of food shortages – its use of force justified on the one hand to meet a crisis situation or necessitated on the other to restore order and initiate emergency measures.
 Only under democracy is government compelled to pay attention to the needs of people at the lowest levels of society.
 The dual pressures of a free press and electoral system have helped a free and democratic India to avoid famine for nearly 50 years, despite the recurring incidence of widespread famine in previous centuries, up to as recently as four years before the country gained independence.

So long as their possession and possible use is tolerated and justified, the relatively low cost of production and high threat potential of these weapons offer strong incentives for other states to acquire them.
 It is unrealistic to expect that any system of international controls or inspections can prevent their eventual acquisition by states that decide to develop them and have the advanced scientific capabilities to do so.
 From the inception of nuclear weapons, two things have been clear.
 There can be no victors in a nuclear war and there is no credible defence against these weapons.
 Confidential studies by NATO in the 1960s concluded that the costs of a nuclear exchange to either party would be so great that the weapons were essentially unusable.
 No satisfactory answer has ever emerged for the question: where and under what circumstances can these weapons be deployed beneficially?
 The continued expansion of nuclear stockpiles over three decades may have added to the self-importance of the military and political leaderships, and perhaps of the general public, in states that possessed them, but there is little evidence that it ever added to national security.
 The unusability of these weapons helps to explain why predictions of rapid spread of these weapons to other states proved to be so wildly exaggerated.
 The irrelevance or unusability of nuclear weapons is evident in all the wars involving major powers during the past four decades.
 A greater understanding of the environmental impact of these weapons has further strengthened the perception of unusability.

rs ago uncertain that a92m nuclear0m test would cause environmental problems, it is92m now0m almost certain that there would be a second nuclear test. It was previously unacceptable that there were no further92m atomic0m tests, such as the 1984 Chernobyl and or June 18-29 nuclear tests in North Korea. Government regulation of nuclear weapons has become even more contentious.<eop><eod> The92m finest0m Caribbean musicians the Company92m produces0m have been displayed throughout the world. the House is experienced in bringing you the finest ports of many leisure specialties.

Lack of employment opportunities is also directly linked to destruction of the environment, both rural and urban.
 The destruction of tropical rain forests has been one result.
 The greatest security challenges of the twenty-first century are economic, not military or political.
 Employment is a sine qua non for meeting these challenges.
 A thorough examination of facts and a dispassionate analysis reveal grounds for hope and opportunities for action.
 The possibility of more rapid economic growth and rising incomes in both developed and developing countries – spurred by further substantial reduction in defence spending, the diffusion and application of new technologies, economic liberalization leading to growth of international trade, the globalization of financial markets, and the emergence of new engines for global expansion among developing countries – indicates that our apprehensions need not prove justified, provided society acts courageously and decisively to meet the challenge.
 A global overview of employment cannot do full justice to the special circumstances, problems and potentials of specific regions and countries, but it can dispel the growing concern that employment has become a problem beyond the means of governments or the global economy to eradicate or even contain.
 In the final analysis, creation of jobs for all is not a question of possibility.
 It is a question of necessity.
 Neither logic nor self-interest justify a detached attitude or a half-hearted effort to address this issue.

 A small crack in my stability let out enough magic to hurt him.
 I didn’t hit him, but the surrounding trees and rocks were pulverized and I knew I had done too much.
 He stared back at me… afraid.

He finally went out to the garden.
 She was way over by the pink roses, and he was surprised and dismayed to see her wearing her 1927 clothes.

 He ran over to her, but something about her stance when she looked up at him kept him from sweeping her into his arms like he wanted.

“It is the one who protected them from our arrows.”
 The other nodded, took up his sword, and charged.
 His brother was not far behind.
 Felewen joined them, for she too had watched as the black shield had knocked aside their arrows and then shattered their bows.
 Aurelia did not move.
 Her eyes were frozen on this strange man.
 Power rolled off him.
 He was strong, and even more so, he was terrifying.
 She had no doubt of this man’s identity; he was the nameless necromancer, one of the few who could best Scoutmaster Dieredon in combat.

Neither parent thought the other was good enough for their child, let alone the fact that they were both still children.
 Once the reason for the marriage was revealed, their parents accepted it as best as they could.
 My father’s parents arranged for them to live together in a small home while they finished school and awaited the birth of their baby.
 It was the late fifties and a pregnant teenager was an embarrassment.
 Shame followed the couple wherever they went.
 Thomas Richard was born on a cold December day to parents who were children themselves.
 I followed just 13 months later, and another brother was born 14 months later and died almost immediately after his birth.
 My mother at 20 years old had two toddlers and had to accept the death of her third baby.
 Years later, I returned to this town and located the home we first shared.
 The home, which had since been converted into a one car garage, still had the old front door located next to a single car garage door that had been put in place of what was once the front window.

“Amazing no one ever robbed this guy before,” he said.
 Qurrah shot him a glance, his meaning clear.
 The half-orc shrugged, drew his swords, and began walking.
 A sleek staircase led to the upper floor, while through the hallway they could see a room with an iron stove and shelves for storing food.
 “Which way do we go?” Harruq asked.
 “Up,” Qurrah said.
 “And quiet, before you wake him.”
 “Too late,” said a voice from the stairs.

Korin’s’ body hit the floor and started to empty itself.
 “Gods,” he thought and asked out loud to no one, “What did he eat this morning?” He grabbed the body and dragged it into the water closet and dropped it into the small bronze tub.
 Rodregas started to leave and then saw Korin’s purse; the Adapt was dressed for travel and Rodregas had yet to find even a single coin in the Master’s chambers.
 He reached down and took the purse off his belt.
 Rodregas opened it to find only a few silvers.
 He knew Korin should have more.
 He opened his shirt and, as he suspected, another purse hung from his neck.
 It was of flat leather and inside it were twelve pieces of silver and a small book.
 Rodregas tentatively touched the book and it buzzed slightly of magic.
 It held no foulness so he tossed it into the trunk.

To the extent that we follow Christ’s example, give of our selves, our time and resources to help people in need, allow time away from the crowds to contemplate and pray, put aside our self concerns and turn to concern for others, our minds and hearts get invaded and possessed by the Holy Spirit.
 And in that condition, the world transforms before our eyes.
 For passing out food, clothing or loving concern we always get blessed, and while we live with a blessed attitude, the most bedraggled people may appear possessed of astonishing beauty, as God must see them.
 When we follow the example of Jesus, through his blessing we begin to perceive the glorious reality of all creation.
 In other words, we enter heaven in all its beauty.

 James 4: 17 in the King James declares, “Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.” The New International Version reads “Anyone, then, who knows the good he ought to do and doesn’t do it, sins."
 The New American Standard’s version is, “Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin.” Put these translations together, they insist that to do good is the right thing and what we ought to do.
 But even in consort, they don’t explain why we ought to do good or why we should avoid sin.
 We could infer we should do it because God said so, but to some of us, that answer feels unworthy.

His hands slid down her back, pulling her hard against him, reminding her of how he'd pinned her against his car last night.
 Moaning at the pleasure of the contact, she wrapped her arms around him, wanting to get even closer to him.
 Rick covered her mouth with his again, his kiss so hot and thorough and demanding that it elicited more moans from her.
 He ended the embrace with a series of quick, hard kisses and then eased his hold on her, panting.
 Marie started to reach for him again, but then her eyes narrowed.
 Pushing against his chest so hard that he stumbled back, she whirled and stormed off into the fog.
 How dare he!
 How dare he use his kisses to try to keep her from going home!
 It was already hard enough just to look at him in the morning before she walked in the garden.

I shook my head.
 He nodded, giving up, but our hands still lay together, connecting us.
 “Where are they?” I asked.

 “They have retreated.
 They were able to briefly incapacitate the wolves, giving Rhys and Rider less warning of their approach before you were attacked.” He hesitated.
 “When we heard the alert, I turned.

I then told her that I had a refill available for ninety Oxys that was good to fill next Tuesday.
 I swear I am making this dialogue up as I go along, just to fit all the necessary criteria and to put her off until next Tuesday.
 The new prescription combined with what I already had would meet the quantity of one hundred Oxys that they wanted.
 I also wanted a solid clarification that I was only going to meet on my terms, just as I had in my fictitious deal.
 Did I mention I am in sales?
 Telling her I sold the drugs to someone else is the classic “take-away” which creates an urgency and desire to comply.
 She said they would buy the Oxys and they would meet me where I wanted.
 She assured me that there would be no bullshit this time.

One moment she was growling at Jess from a distance of more than five feet, the next instant she was on top of Jess, and her teeth were latched around the smaller wolf's throat.
 Dominic's hand tightened on mine as Jess began to whine, but Alec took a menacing step forward and Jasmin released Jessica with another growl.
 "She didn't want to let go, did she?"
 Dom looked for a second like she wasn't going to answer, but she finally shook her head.
 "It's harder to control the instincts, the beast inside us, if you will, while we're in an alternate form.

 We'll get you home, and then your mom is going to get an offer that's too good to pass up.
 With any luck you'll both be out of town within a couple days.
 I think I can arrange it so neither of you will be back for a year or two.
 That should be more than enough time for this all to resolve itself one way or another."

"Such a good boy."
 Rachel, tears coursing down her face, stormed off as Alec pulled his mother's door shut behind us.
 I started to follow her, but Alec recaptured my hand in his.
 "She just needs a little time.

 My surprise must have bled through to my face.
 Alec's smile had a tinge of sadness to it as he led me away.
 "There's still a lot you don't know about all of the others.
 There's much I could tell you about Jasmin, but it isn't my story to share.

Many smiled; he thought a few looked like the ones in the hall, not sure what to think of this new knight.
 Rodregas was not surprised that when he started to kneel in front of the Grand Marshal, for Van’dret to step forward and speak.
 “Grand Marshal, you are not really thinking of knighting this fiend, are you?
 He killed a fellow squire out there.
 And he consorts with Nymphs and Infernals, not people of the Celestial Realm.
 You do the Order a disservice to make him a Knight of the Soaring Heavens.” Van’dret’s voice was slow and reasonable sounding and he spoke not so much to the Grand Marshal as to the audience.
 “I but follow the rules of the Order as they have stood for unknown centuries, Ambassador.
 While there are many things that go into raising a squire to knighthood, the tournament is the exception.
 The rules are simple; win and you win knighthood.
 While undue bloodshed can disqualify you, a single death during the tournament is not unusual.” While the Grand Marshal spoke, he did not look at the audience.

 I wasn't entirely satisfied, but nodded, and followed her to algebra.
 Mrs. Campbell shot us both a glance that didn't bode well for any attempt to get out of class without a stern reprimand, but allowed us to go to our respective seats without comment.
 I pulled out the two assignments I'd done the night before, and passed them up with everyone else's homework.
 Realizing the lecture wouldn't do me any good, I pulled out my book, and started reading the next section in my self-appointed study regimen.
 Mrs. Campbell either understood what I was trying to accomplish, or was saving up all her venom for after class.
 She didn't call on me even once.
 Britney wasn't so lucky, and I caught a nasty look from her each time I surfaced from my textbook.

Her sword wove in and out, back and forth.
 Rodregas blocked one blow only to find two others coming at him.
 He quickly found himself on the defensive and suffered both a cut on his upper hand and cheek.
 He started to worry that the knight would end the match and give Karun the victory.
 He tried to use his speed to advantage and trap her sword.
 But he nearly lost his sword instead.
 He realized that he was outclassed.
 Her skills were better than his own and Rodregas’ physical abilities were not so much greater than hers as to counter her superior fighting skills.
 For the first time in the tournament Rodregas lost control of the flow of the match as suddenly she moved in swinging hard.
 Then again, and again, she went in close with her shield wedging it in, and was able to lock it to his left for just a second.

 BG: 	Well, obviously, we ended up in the bedroom that first evening.
 I think she walked over to me and simply whispered, fuck me.
 I think it was that straightforward.
 There was no bullshit about Lor—there still isn’t.
 We ended up on her bed, which is a story in itself.

Once I made it past the second part of his statement, I was able to start considering the first part of what he'd said.
 It was horrifying and amazing all at once, and it made complete sense.
 His mom was living in memories because the real world was just a pale shadow of her life with his father.
 Alec seemed to take my silence as condemnation, or possibly just agreement with his self-condemnation.
 "We're where the legends of succubi originated.
 Irresistible demons who drain their victims dry, who leave their lovers a hollow shell of what they were before."
 I'd finally worked through things enough inside my mind, to respond, but he bulldozed right over me.

I waited, and he proceeded carefully, “You know you are bound.” “Yes,” I agreed, even though I wasn’t clear how I was partially bound.
 I could use some magic, I had lost some memories.
 No, that isn’t true, is it?
 I couldn’t really remember anything from before the village.
 Anything except the dreams.
 “And I’m sure you want to be unbound?” Why is that a question?
 “Of course.” He nodded as if he were going down a checklist.
 “We know council has bound you.” I waited for the next detail, my fingers curling into my palms.
 “And we know they must be the one or ones to unbind you.” Some part of me realized the seriousness of the conversation, but all I could do was listen.

“Assassins!” a guard shouted, drawing his blade.
 The other guards, six in total, did the same.
 The perfumed man in the center shook as he realized combat was about to erupt.
 “It is seven against two, you stupid pigs,” he shouted.
 “What are you thinking?”
 “That you will die last,” Qurrah said before casting his first spell.
 The fire in the center of the camp flickered and then died.
 The half-orcs, through their mixed blood, could see well in the darkness.

Imeralda said, “The need for a connection to sense the rooms would be true for the knights as well.
 We know that neither Hellborn nor Nymphs are usually allowed in.
 In that case there might actually be another room behind the forth wall that we simply don’t have a connection to and therefore cannot sense.” The others nodded.
 Rodregas thought that they were heading along the right path.
 Imeralda asked, “Does that mean that in this room these are great sigils as well?
 Ones that require Infernal sourced magic to work?
 That kind of makes sense if you can have greater sigils that are the shapes of the Celestial Beasts.
 Why not daemons of the Infernal Realm as well?

 Britney looked a little crestfallen, but her eyes quickly lit back up, and before I could get my notebook out and start writing, she'd already switched seats to one closer to a gaggle of cheerleaders.

The five permanent members should agree to the suspension of their veto power on this issue so crucial to the future of humanity.
 8.The danger to all nations of unexpected and unprovoked attack from near or distant powers can be vastly reduced by declaring an immediate ban on the use of ballistic missiles of all types, including those carrying conventional war heads.
 This would eliminate the discriminatory provisions that deny missile acquisition to some while preserving the right of others to maintain and develop this purely offensive capability.
 It would also eliminate the need for missile defence systems, which no nation can afford and which are the only possible defence against ballistic missile weapons.
 The ban on use should be followed by urgent measures to dismantle and scrap this entire class of weapons worldwide.
 9.Highest priority must be given to controlling and reversing the proliferation of small arms in line with the determined international measures employed to curb hijacking.
 As an immediate first step, these weapons should be classified and a UN register created to monitor their manufacture and sale.
 Agreements should be negotiated between major arms suppliers to severely restrict production and sales.
 Strong sanctions must be instituted to discourage states from actively or passively abetting small arms proliferation, especially to non-state actors.
 10.UN action to curb the international trade in major armaments needs to go further than the existing Arms Register.

He slid it under his cloak and it disappeared from my view.
 I couldn’t imagine what she had given him, but it must have been in trade for my stone.
 As I peered through the gap in the doorframe, the stranger’s eyes flicked to mine and I was sure she somehow saw me.
 I held my breath and jerked away from view, plastering myself against the wall.
 When she didn’t speak up to expose me, my pulse began to slow.
 But I wasn’t brave enough to look again.
 I stared into the room, the space relatively large and ornate compared to my bedroom at home.
 There was a stone-framed bed wide enough for two, dark olive blankets in layers on top.
 A side table held a few trinkets and a decanter set, and there was a hickorywood wardrobe in the corner.

 It was headed that way.

He blocked the blow with his sword and then bashed down quick and hard multiple times with his shield.
 He thought he heard a bone break.
 Rodregas paused and the knight signaled him as victor with a finger to the Heavens.
 Rodregas followed this pattern throughout the day.
 He kept using his sword more to block than to attack and kept using his shield offensively.
 This allowed him to take advantage of his unnatural strength to overwhelm his foes.
 According to the contest rules, he could replace his shield after every fourth match if need be.
 By the final match, he was on his third and final shield.
 Most of the rest of the matches were with squires with no ribbons.

 The final days of sparring with Aurelia passed quietly and swiftly.
 Aurelia asked for no stories and Harruq told her none.
 They simply enjoyed each other’s company, fought to the extent of their skill, and then parted.
 On the fourteenth and final day, however, Harruq was in an unusually quiet mood.
 His mind refused to stay on the mock combat, and many times a quick jab of Aurelia’s staff cracked his arm or wrist when he should have easily deflected it away.

Water flowed beneath, smoothing the stones at the base.
 They were so worn, it must have been in place for centuries.
 The leather soles of my shoes skimmed over ancient stone, the bridge curving gently before flattening out into a worn dirt path on the other side.
 It was more traveled than I would have liked, so I swung wide, through the trees instead.
 The wind shifted and the scent of roasting meat assaulted me, dragging my attention, my feet, its way.
 Despite my concerns about other elves, my stomach tightened, my mouth watering as I followed it through the trees.
 They broke into a small clearing, and there in the center stood a cloaked figure, kneeling down as he turned a meat-covered spit.
 Pressed tight behind an oak tree, I shuffled sideways to get a better view.
 I was sure it was an elf, male, from his size.

 “My things,” Harruq said, his voice coming out as a weak croak.

 “In the shed,” Qurrah said.
 “That where you two live?”
 “Yes.”

 Ahrqur glanced to Qurrah, and his mouth opened to speak.
 Both Tun brothers felt a bit of panic, wondering what their new master might say if he learned what they had done.
 Instead, he closed his mouth and glared at Velixar one last time before running north on legs that would never tire.
 “When will you know of his success or failure?” Qurrah asked once his eyes could no longer perceive the elf’s faint outline.
 “Immediately,” Velixar whispered.

The poorest 20 per cent of the world’s population share a minuscule 1.4 per cent of the world’s income.
 According to current projections, 300 million people, representing nearly 50 per cent of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, will live below the poverty line at the turn of the century.
 Environment: Unsustainable lifestyles and consumption (in industrial countries) and population growth, along with rising levels of production and consumption (in developing countries), will place strenuous demands on the environment of the planet.
 Growing damage to the basic life support systems of soil, water, flora, fauna and the atmosphere is taking place in all parts of the world.
 Unemployment: In the West, rising levels of unemployment have increased resistance to free trade and immigration.
 Rising levels of long-term unemployment and youth unemployment in inner cities are associated with the increasing incidence of crime.
 In developing countries, rapid population growth continues to outpace job creation in most regions, resulting in high levels of unemployment, increasing social unrest and large scale migration from rural to urban areas and internationally.
 Gender discrimination: Gender remains a major determinant of privilege and discrimination worldwide.
 Women still suffer from unfavourable sex ratios, lower wages and restraints on property owner ship, as well as higher levels of illiteracy and lower educational attainments.
 Rising violence: Violence is on the increase, especially violence within society in the form of civil wars, crime and drugs.

What would be the result elsewhere of further decline in Eastern Europe?
 These questions are of vital relevance to the entire world.
 A detailed study should be conducted under the auspices of the United Nations, OECD or the European Commission to quantify the potential gains or losses to the global economy of rapid or slow progress of the transition in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
 10.Scientific resources: Science has been one of the greatest casualties of the reform programme.
 Severe fiscal constraints have forced governments to reduce drastically budgetary allocations to research institutions, leaving most of these institutions with little or no source of revenues to support their activities.
 High priority must be given to developing a detailed plan for preservation of the scientific research infra structure during the difficult transition period and for restructuring it so that it can be integrated effectively into the emerging market system.
 The drain of talents must be stopped by a concerted national effort to exploit each country's competitive advantage in science by marketing these capabilities internationally, and particularly by linking up with other countries in the region and with developing countries that can most benefit from the region's scientific and technological capabilities.

 Ironically, despite all the international debate about transition, thus far the actual goal of the transition process has never been clearly spelled out.

A surge of dread washed through me as Vincent backed closer to the wall in an effort to maintain his distance from Alec.
 I half expected for the incredible tension I'd been feeling before to disappear, but instead it morphed slightly.
 If I hadn't known it was absolutely absurd, I would've said it felt like there was a tingly wind blowing down the stairs, pushing Vincent along before it.
 Isaac moved slightly.
 It was a small change of position, but somehow incredibly menacing.
 It wasn't until Vincent froze in place that I realized Isaac's shift had kept Vincent squarely between him and Alec.
 It was like watching a pair of wolves bringing down an elk.
 I'd seen gangs work together like this before, but it seemed strangely out of place in Sanctuary.
 I was positive there was going to be a fight after all, but then Vincent grabbed some poor freshman, shoved him into Isaac, and pushed his way downstairs as Isaac caught the human missile.
 As soon as Vincent was safely out of sight, everyone surged forward to congratulate Isaac on having saved Ben, and Ben on having not died.

I scooted my desk over and picked up a weight to hand to him, only to see the thread break as he successfully figured out the breaking point.
 Again and again it happened.
 I ran a calculation for how many pulleys we'd need to lift our weight up the thirty-degree incline on a string able to hold only a fourth as much, only to look over at his paper and see not only had he already arrived at the correct figure, he'd already thought to adjust for starting friction.
 Not used to being outclassed academically, I got flustered, which led to a misplaced decimal, and then an incorrect conversion from English to metric.
 Alec just continued on, never seeming to really hurry, never actually making a mistake, but still grinding through calculations with a speed I might have been able to match on a good day, but couldn't even approach today.
 It would've been much easier to just stop my efforts and watch him work, but I was too stubborn to give up.
 Alec finished up with the theoretical portion of the assignment, and started stringing the pulleys while most of the other groups were still arguing over whether or not they could afford to add a few extra grams for extra credit.
 If there was a single person in the class who didn't need any extra credit, it was Alec; but he calmly loaded the system with an extra sixteen grams, caught Mrs. Alexander's eye, and then smoothly started the train of weights moving up the ramp, over the wall, through the woods, and right up to Grandma's house.
 It wasn't fair that someone who missed so many days of school could be so consistently right.
 He must have an IQ of 160.

When it continued he started to worry about his ability to keep from jerking away from the small figurine.
 Just when he was sure that he could not keep his arm still the pain smoothed and stopped.
 As Jordaan relaxed his grip and released him, Rodregas shook his arm and then his body, trying to feel the difference.
 It felt almost like someone had drawn all over him from the inside, but there was no visible difference.
 There was no sign that a bit of his magic had been used up in the creation of a permanent effect.
 Rodregas sat and watched as Doi’van and then Imeralda undertook the inscription of the minor sigil.
 From Rodregas’ perspective the next two seemed to withstand the pain a lot better than then he had.

The decision on whether to permit the continued existence of nuclear weapons is of too great importance to the future of humanity to be left to the discretion of one or a few member nations of the international community.
 Under the present structure of the UN, the only body with authority to act is the Security Council, but the veto power of the five permanent members deprives other nations of an effective voice.
 The proposal to ban completely the possession and use of nuclear weapons should be put before the Council.
 The right of veto should be rescinded with respect to this most crucial issue.
 A time-bound plan should be drawn up by the UN for complete and total nuclear disarmament by all nations.
 Ban on ballistic missiles
 Nuclear devices are the most lethal class of weapons, but much of their threat arises from the development of ballistic missile technology which can deliver them to distant targets unmanned and without risk to the aggressor.
 Even if nuclear weapons are eliminated, these vehicles can be utilized to carry large conventional payloads that strike terror in a distant population.
 The danger to all nations of unexpected and unprovoked attack from near or distant powers can be vastly reduced by declaring an immediate ban on the use of ballistic missiles of all types, including those carrying conventional warheads.
 This proposal, first put forth by US President Reagan in 1986, would eliminate the discriminatory provisions that deny missile acquisition to some, while preserving the right of others to maintain and develop this purely offensive capability.

In first grade, she had decided to become a teacher.
 Over thirteen years, K-8, she missed only two days of school, and those were unavoidable.
 Her Christian school was showing an early film version of Tim LeHay’s Left Behind saga, and Pam couldn’t bear the sight of nice enough pastors getting left behind.
 She won an academic scholarship to Pepperdine University and worked her way through two Masters degrees.
 But to teach where she wanted to go, she needed a PhD.
 A baby might stand in the way of her career, she believed, and I couldn’t argue.
 Besides, with a little good fortune and without the cost of another dependent, as soon as Darcy and Cody finished college I could take early retirement from my day job and devote myself to writing, which had been my dream for too many years.
 I longed for the freedom to run off for weeks at a time to some hermitage where I could think better and write with deeper concentration.

Ravenhurr had been simply too powerful for Rodregas to dream of destroying.
 He was stronger, faster, and smarter than him to the point where even dreams of fighting him had never crossed his mind until this past week.
 However, his assistant Korin had only been an Immortalist for a few decades; his victims and his power were still purely mortal.
 Rodregas had known that in a fair fight he could kill him.
 Korin was no warrior, and his actions spoke of cowardice when Korin hurt those who had no chance in a fight against him.
 Rodregas had been trying to get him alone, where he could kill him without blame, for years.
 Rodregas went over and reached down to grab the bottom of the heavily made bed, and almost fell over when the bed lifted far more easily than expected.
 The sound of wood screeched as weight switched to the back legs of the bed and then moved at his awkward action, and the top of the columns smashed against the plaster ceiling.
 Rodregas carefully lowered the bed back down; as the bed settled back to the floor he was covered by a light dusting of plaster from the damaged ceiling.
 Was Rodregas really that strong?

 I know it isn't the best idea but please don't stop her.
 Not tonight."
 It was like I could see the thoughts dart around as he put pieces together, and I was suddenly torn between telling him in the hopes it would buy Jasmin her last night with Ben, and trying to keep her secret.
 My heart raced until he finally relaxed and sank back down with me.

Good enough for the common soldier, but I fancy something a little more distinctive.” Rodregas was about to ask him what he had in mind when they found out why they had been waiting; two more slavers came up with drawn bows.
 They were going to take them from a safe distance.
 Doi’van and he needed no words; they both knew only instant action gave them a chance.
 Rodregas would like to have tried to take on one of the Immortal Guards, but he had already noticed that the slaver with the mace was a little too close and a little too far away from his nearest companion.
 He was a skinny man with dirty hair and seemed to be having trouble holding his heavy weapon.
 Rodregas stepped in close and the slaver swung the mace with surprising force, but he met it with the shield and knocked it aside.
 Rodregas moved with simply too much speed to be blocked.
 He slid the short sword into the slaver’s stomach and gutted him in a quick and vicious move.
 Doi’van immediately launched himself at the next slaver, and followed suit, slamming his opponent’s sword away and gutting him before he had a chance to move.
 Rodregas then went for the nearest Immortal Guard.

They quickly spread all over the yard.
 It would be better for the town folk who lived so close to the fort if the Dire Cats were not starving when they left.
 On his way into the dungeon, he left all the doors propped open so the way out would be clear, and he made sure that all the other doors were closed.
 Luckily, the kitchen drudge had locked herself in the kitchen quarters.
 Rodregas then went back to the dungeon level and opened the opposite door and then the Dire Cats’ prison door and watched.
 He had expected them to either bolt for it or stay in the “safety” of their room.
 Instead they both casually got up and walked out, as if they were guests in a fancy inn, with all the time in the world.
 As they walked out the door both cats gave him a casual glance as he held the two doors firmly closed together bracing for the weight if they threw themselves at the doors, but they just walked by and headed up the stairs.
 He wanted to follow, but Rodregas held himself back patiently waiting until it was safe.

We were getting old enough to know that we were different than most families in many ways, but we always knew we had a loving mother.
 Thomas and I also knew that the only other consistent thing in our life was each other.
 We were very close in size and we were often mistaken as twins although I had blond hair and he had brown.
 We fought like all brothers did, but we had always shared a bedroom and we talked each other to sleep every night.
 I never remember my mother dating much, so I think she was careful not to introduce us to any suitor until it was more serious.
 She eventually met a man who she was serious about, Dino.
 He would sometimes bring food we were not accustomed to eating, like steak.
 I had no memory of any man ever giving us a gift or anything of the sort before, but occasionally he would bring us a trinket to our mother’s delight.
 He was a big man with a dark complexion and jet-black hair and he would often talk on the phone in his native Greek.
 Thomas and I had never heard someone speak in a foreign language so it was intriguing.

"Please don't send me there.
 Not after my dream."
 There was just enough moonlight trickling into the room for me to see his expression change.
 My stomach seemed to reach up and wrap itself around my heart as I realized it was the expression he used when it was important to him that people not know what he was thinking.
 "I'm not sure that's the best idea."
 The tears finally made their escape as I crumpled back onto the bed.
 "You're right.
 I'm so sorry to be such a bother."
 The words were broken by gasping sobs, but they were understandable, if only just barely.
 Alec's hand on my shoulder just made me try to roll away.

But if it helped, if there was a way to unbind me, free my mind and get back the magic… I settled on a, “Mm-hm?” He nearly smiled.
 “Well, if you were able to… move about…” It seemed to make him uncomfortable, searching for words.
 “Then perhaps you could find a way around it.” I bit my lip and he reached up to gently pull it loose.
 His hand lingered, thumb tracing my bottom lip.
 I was definitely not imagining that.
 Warmth flooded my neck, my cheeks, and his gaze followed the flush.
 His hand dropped to my shoulder.
 “Please, Freya, try.” All I could do was nod.
 And then he stood and walked away.

She was obviously mad, but once again I couldn't muster enough concern to figure out what'd ticked her off.
 I blinked several times as I realized Mrs. Campbell had been speaking to me for several seconds.
 She was important, one of the few teachers that actually liked me.
 It was incredibly hard, but I focused on what she was saying, voluntarily pulling myself partway out of the wonderful cushion and exposing myself to some of the pain.
 "Are you sure you're okay?"
 My nod and smile must not have been very convincing.
 "Listen, there isn't any real reason to keep the lab open so late today, and you've made amazing progress catching up.
 Why don't you take the night off, and go straight home?"

But at the same time they stimulate growth of employment in many different ways – increasing demand for the products thus manufactured by a factor of 10, 100 or even 1000 fold as in the case of automobiles, TVs, cell phones and computers; increasing the demand for research workers to support technological innovation and for teachers to meet the rising demand for education; and rising living standards, which increases consumption of other goods and services due to the falling prices made possible by rising productivity.
 Over the past two decades the US economy lost nearly 4 million manufacturing jobs but added a net 37 million jobs through expansion of the service sector, which now accounts for 84 per cent of total employment.
 It is time that we stop resisting or resenting this trend, but rather strive to adapt by shifting our focus toward those fields of employment which are most directly stimulated by technological innovation.
 Export of commercial services already accounts for 20 per cent of world trade.
 The shift from manufacturing to services is a positive and inevitable expression of the elevation of human activity from the physical to the mental level, which is the central reason for the phenomenal rise in global living standards over the past century.
 Rich nations have become rich through a shift of workers from the primary farm sector to value-added, non-farm secondary and tertiary sectors.
 Poverty and hunger persist so long as a majority of the population depend upon the routine operations of farming for their livelihood.
 This is also the cause of the growing feminization of poverty in developing countries.
 Today’s developed nations arrived at their present position by a long, slow migration from agriculture to manufacturing to service sector, but that does not mean developing countries must follow the same path.
 The growing demand for services in the developed world coupled with rapid strides in telecommunications has created the possibility of skipping steps to abridge the development process.

Such constraints limited part-time jobs to around 10 per cent of the total in Belgium, France, Italy and Spain compared to around 25 per cent in Britain and Denmark.
 4.Modify tax policies:The present income and payroll tax system raises the real cost of labour relative to other resources, such as capital and energy, and thereby discourages job creation.
 It heavily taxes people for working, which indirectly raises the cost of labour and reduces the number of jobs.
 At the same time the system provides investment and depreciation incentives that encourage indus try to shift from labour-intensive to capital-intensive modes of production.
 Much of the shift from labour to capital might not be economically justified were it not for the in-built bias in this system.
 Low levels of taxation on the depletion of non-renewable energy resources in the United States is another distorting influence that makes machine-driven activity more cost-effective than it would otherwise be.
 5.Analyse job impact of government policies: Almost every government policy has a direct or indirect impact on employment.
 Often the relationship is not recognized or intended.
 An analysis of the impact of major public policies on employment at the local, state and nation level can result in avoidance or removal of significant legislative and administrative roadblocks to job growth.
 Require employment assessment of new policy initiatives prior to adoption.

Surrender is the remedy, at least for panic attacks.
 Maybe for everything.
 As I pass the turnoff to my former home in Chico, I think, surrender must make perfect sense to anyone who adores God like Brother Lawrence did.
 When we are around someone we adore, our defenses cave in, because the only thing we fear, the only thing that needs defending, is the communion with the one we adore.
 If we adore God and live in His presence, we are in constant communion with the eternal, way beyond death.
 So, what’s left to fear.
 The enemy is truly us, in particular the defenses we have established between us and God.
 Vanquish our defensive selves, we are set free.
 One of the songs on my I-pod, "I Surrender All," has long been a favorite.
 I listen, I sing along, I pray the lyrics, I perform the song accompanied by my guitar.

 It looked like it could have been the twin for the beast that had been devoured by the blue flame on top of Raven Keep.
 He stepped up close looking up at the beast; he was massive!
 The beast’s mouth was open, not as if he was going to roar, but simply in relaxed pose.
 He looked like he had been caught stalking forward on the hunt.
 Rodregas stepped up and just stared at him.
 He was beautiful.
 “Don’t touch,” barked Doi’van.
 Rodregas nodded, he knew not to touch, but then realized that his hand was raised and had been reaching out to stroke the lion’s mane.
 He knew that this was the greater sigil that he wanted to gain.

Doi’van handed over the equipment and said, “How did you break a shield on a single joust?” Rodregas grunted a non-committal response, and tried to find a comfortable position to hold his lance.
 “This is our last shield so when it is gone, we are done,” Doi’van said.
 Rodregas nodded in response, he had to get right back to the tilt, as it was still his turn to fight.
 Rodregas’ opponent was waiting for his return and was off full speed as soon as the flag fell.
 Doom Hoof was barely into a trot before the new opponent came into range.
 Rodregas knew he could not hit straight up against the more heavily armored and mounted opponent.
 So he dropped away from his opponent’s side with speed that his opponent could not match and then stood up in his stirrups and swung his lance into the man.
 That move was similar to one of the moves Doi’van had taught him with the quarterstaff.
 A normal lancer did not have the strength to use the heavy lance in such a way.
 His blow landed high and Rodregas drove his lance into the man’s shoulder.

I wonder, if I were given the choice between writing a wonderful book or achieving deeper communion, which would I choose?
 The woman I call Sweet still haunts me.
 I imagine if some good Christian folks would suggest that God might have sent her to me, others would assure me she was in the devil’s employ.
 Whether she came from God, the devil, or by pure coincidence is academic to me.
 If instead of her, Father Abraham would’ve appeared and reminded me that he was willing to not only surrender his son but to impale and burn his own child, I wouldn’t for a moment consider following his lead, even as far as the give her up part.

 Still, something had changed.
 I held onto that hope right up until I saw Mrs. Sorenson joining everyone else in staring at me whenever I looked down at my book.
 There was no mistaking the look on her face; it was utter distaste, possibly with a dash of disdain.
 I was so tired of it all.
 By the time English rolled around my natural embarrassment had given way to actual anger at Britney for starting it all.
 She tried to catch me at our lockers in between classes, but I pretended not to hear her, and made it safely into Mr. Whethers' class before she could catch up.

 The feeling lasted exactly as long as it took me to sit down, listen to Mrs. Sorenson tell us all that she'd finished grading our tests, and then see the big, self-satisfied 'D' sitting at the top of my paper.

The goal of the drug dealer will be to get me on his ground and on his terms.

I knew it wouldn’t be easy because as it turns out she knew of me through high school and my reputation preceded me.
 Would this “good girl” give her number to a “bad boy?” The ploy worked and somehow Lisa agreed to let me call her.
 Lisa had been dating a guy for years and I knew of him.
 He had attended our high school and he was the quarterback of the football team (my polar opposite).
 She had only come to the club the night I met her because she was angry with her boyfriend because he choose to spend Valentine’s Day with his brother playing basketball (take notes boys).
 She had called a friend who told her she could get her into this bar because she knew the bartender and they were both under legal drinking age.
 Lisa was 20.
 She was a “good girl” and hadn’t ever done anything like that.
 She had no intention of breaking up with her boyfriend.
 I looked her square in her beautiful blue eyes and I told her flatly, “You are going to fall so in love with me that you will not even remember this guy’s name!” We were married three years later.

San Diego State University was surrounded by faith centers.

 Since my profession of faith, my only steps in God's direction were reading through the Bible, praying now and then, and getting baffled by J.D.
 Salinger's Franny and Zoey, about a girl who goes around constantly muttering "Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on us."
 Her family decides she's crazy, and I agreed.
 Hoping to keep the light alive, I visited several churches that gave me the creeps, with clammy skin and something like nausea, the same feeling I have gotten from the sallow eyes of anorexics who obviously courted suicide, and from remembering nights I had to spend with my sinister grandmother, the Christian Scientist.
 Another couple churches reminded me of the country club where I used to smash golf balls until I grew weary of the country club people.
 I tried a few college youth groups whose leaders appeared either self-righteous or too naive to offer much truth.

 Months later, Harruq awoke at the dawn, jerking upward and uttering a sharp gasp.
 A constant cry of danger rang in his ears.
 A quick survey showed he slept alone in their small shed, his brother missing.
 “Qurrah?” he dared ask.
 “Outside,” came Qurrah’s muffled reply.
 Harruq stretched, pushed away a plank of wood from the window, and climbed out.
 The sun was halfway visible, the standard noises of the city only in their infancy.

Alec nodded, a short choppy motion that eloquently conveyed his desire not to discuss the matter.
 He turned towards me, only to break off as a cell phone rang.
 "It's for you, probably your mom.
 Pretend you're home, I'll explain once you're finished."
 I almost dropped the phone, and probably wouldn't have managed to figure out how to answer the call in time if he hadn't reached over and pushed the green button for me.
 "Hello?"
 "Adri, honey, are you sure this is a good idea?
 I haven't gotten on the charter plane yet, there's still time to call this off if you're uneasy about being alone for so long."
 The last place I wanted her right now was home though, so it was easier than normal to lie.

The Immortalist Sorcerer in the form of a tall athletic human female with spectacular long red hair and blue eyes gave Van’dret a silent glare before responding.
 “Last night at the arena party you agreed to ask Van’dret where Oreintvenir is,” She replied in a clear clipped voice.
 “Actually,” Van’dret responded, “I think I said that my visit to his solar would be a perfect opportunity to ask him if he knew the location of our missing Grand Master.” “So why did you not take advantage of the opportunity?
 If anyone knows where Oreintvenir is; it is Taiga” “My lovely Gracella, you are an Immortalist of impressive power and intellect.
 But we are Immortalist, time is on our side and Grand Master Oreintvenir has been gone for less than a year.
 It is not unusual for one of his power to be gone for such a length of time.
 He could be anywhere on this world or beyond it.
 There is no need to be in such a... rush to ask questions.” “Van’dret doesn’t play your word games with me, you know, and I know that this is not a normal disappearance.

"I've wanted to say thanks for a while.
 I really appreciate you making Cassie back down yesterday.
 Nobody else has ever stood up for me like that.
 At least not people that I didn't already know."
 Based on what I'd seen less than thirty hours ago, it didn't look like her friends stood up for her either.
 "No worries, it just seemed like the thing to do at the time.
 Why did she want to hurt you anyways?"
 Rachel looked down, but somehow it wasn't a gesture that conveyed guilt.
 "It's complicated."

It was late by the time I reached the tree and I was tired enough I didn’t care as much about being caught.
 I didn’t even know if they knew who broke the seal, if they knew I was the guilty party.
 But I was still quiet as I entered the house, then my room, and slid into bed.
 The next morning I slipped out early to call on Junnie.
 When I reached her door, it was cracked open again.
 I pushed it aside and scanned the front room, to no avail.
 I walked through to check the back, but still found nothing.
 Junnie was exceedingly clean and organized, so I couldn’t tell if she’d even been home.
 I wandered back to the front door and was surprised by a tall figure there.
 The elaborate robe and tassels of a decorated council member blocked my way and the fear returned.

Several weeks later, came the first night where neither the cats nor Doi’van were in the room.
 Doi’van was out messing with the well, Imeralda was reading one of the magic Grimoires by the fireplace.
 Rodregas was supposed to be reading as well, but had lost his focus on the complex diagram and was just looking at Imeralda.
 She was so beautiful, slim yet curvy.
 Some of those curves were smooth muscle and some were pure female.
 She seemed to have brought together two of the most attractive parts of the AElves and the Nymphs: the slim athletic body of the AElf with the full curves of a Nymph.
 Her skin had a smooth, light golden brown color that often shined with sweat during their practices and looked so soft that it was hard not to reach out and touch it.
 “Did you need something?” asked Imeralda.
 Rodregas had not realized that she had noticed him watching her.
 There was a tease to her voice and expression that said she knew what he was thinking and that she did not mind.

Brandon tensed up for a second, and then his massive arm relaxed under my hand as he followed my gaze.
 "That's Ben."
 His voice dropped to a rumbling whisper.
 "The one I told you about the other day."
 It was incredibly obvious, all the while making absolutely no sense.
 He was obviously uncomfortable this morning, just like you'd expect from someone who was in the unenviable position of telling off a borderline psychopath.
 Everything I'd seen substantiated Brandon's explanation, but why would Jasmin become so enamored of someone so average-looking?
 Not only that, what were the odds Ben was one of the eight males in America who would decide they weren't interested in dating the most gorgeous girl on the planet, even if she was a nut case?
 I was still trying to sort out all the pieces when Brandon fished his cell phone out of a pocket and checked the time.
 In an amazing display of herd behavior, thirty seconds later his friends had all disappeared, and he was standing to leave.

After the millions of thoughts and moments that have haunted me during this evening I begin to focus on my current life, not my past.
 I think of my wife who has been left in silence for nearly four hours.
 I think of my sons, Brandon completely fucked up from his drug addiction and Bryce away at college completely unaware of what is happening and what risk his dad is about to take.
 It occurs to me that Bryce and my wife may never forgive Brandon if something were to happen to me.
 I recall their little league baseball games and soccer teams I coached.
 All of the art projects which we proudly displayed with the help of refrigerator magnets over the years.
 Particular events in their life pop in and out of my head.
 Their future begins to enter my mind and I hope and pray that I will see Brandon free from his addiction one day and see Bryce graduate college.
 Who will they marry one day, how many children will they have, will I be a grandpa or a memory?
 Too many thoughts are packed in my head as I realize this is my life and my family’s life passing before me as the moment of truth approaches.

When the battle comes, slaughter the elves from behind.
 You must weaken them enough so that Vaelor’s army has a chance at victory.”
 “We will not fail,” Qurrah promised.
 “Where will we meet you?”
 “Listen for where the screams are at their worst,” Velixar said as his shadow began to fade.
 “There shall I be.”
 A pale hand reached inside his robes and pulled out five glass vials.
 Qurrah knelt and accepted the gifts.
 “The vials contain powerful healing elixirs.

His symptoms seemed to be suddenly better and his detox wasn’t as severe as we thought it would be or as bad as it had been the first time years before.
 And I cocked my head and listened more carefully to his lies— the lies which I suddenly realized were consistent with his past behavior when he was high.
 Stop the presses!
 I sprung up and shook my finger in the air in front of his face.
 “Are you high right now, Brandon?” “Nah.” He looked at his Converse.
 “When was the last time you took Oxy?” No response.
 Brandon shuffled his feet and stretched his spine, scratched the corner of his eye, but as is consistent with his behavior, continued to lie and deny.
 I am shaking my arms and getting down in Brandon’s face.
 I am shouting at his face.

He waited for her to add, "If I'm still here."
 When she didn't, he released a slow sigh of relief.
 "OK.  You probably won't be so nervous about it next time."
 She smiled, joining him on the sofa.
 "I might even use garlic again.
 But I have to admit that I sneaked upstairs to brush my teeth after we ate."
 He tilted her face up so that their lips were almost touching.
 "So did I."

He wasn’t going to scream.

 His back twisted and he fell, a motionless heap on the ground.
 His body was bent out of recognition.
 It was over.
 My ears had stopped ringing the moment he’d hit the ground.
 Ruby relaxed and stepped away from me.
 I wanted to catch up with what had happened but no one was talking, the mountain was silent.

Jordaan simply stood watching the scene, without his normal expression of cheer.
 Finally Rodregas turned to Jordaan and said, “Imeralda is right and I apologize for our anger.
 It is misplaced.
 My life and the life of my friend are well worth the price and we are in your debt.” At Rodregas’ words Jordaan simply nodded and then stepped into the trees, disappearing as the Nymphs had a habit of doing when in nature.
 “I had better go apologize to Imeralda,” said Rodregas.
 “You should wait a while and let her rage cool first,” suggested Doi’van slowly.
 He spoke as one who was very familiar with rage.
 Rodregas realized that Doi’van was probably right so he sat back and tried to think of the right words to speak when the timing was better.
 Unfortunately when Rodregas did speak to Imeralda his explanations and apology were not well received.

Its ears had the only hint of non-black on the beast, a slight touch of silver.
 The fur was not as soft as it looked and was actually rough to the touch.
 Rodregas realized his hand was sinking into the skin.
 He tried to pull back but felt himself being drawn into it.
 He was being pulled physically into the panther.
 He started to pull away, but then he stopped and let himself sink into the shape of the great beast.
 Panic set in as his mouth started to sink into the creature’s head.
 He tried to hold his breath, but he was too late for such an action.

I sucked in a ragged breath, then another.
 I seemed fine, maybe a little dizzy, but otherwise it was gone.
 Unclenching my body, I looked around, expecting someone to be leaning over me, attempting to help.
 But nothing appeared out of place.
 I pushed up on shaky limbs.
 Chevelle was by the fire, preparing to roast the birds.
 Steed stood beside his horse, adjusting the saddle’s straps.
 Both had their backs turned to me as if they’d not even noticed.
 A wave of vertigo hit when I tried to speak and I fell back against the tree limb to steady myself.

“Put him on the ground and kneel on him,” Rodregas said to Doi’van.
 The Hellborn nodded and pushed the sorcerer down on the cold stone ground.
 He next straddled the man with his knees, pining his shoulders.
 “I am going to ask him a few questions.
 If either of you think he is going to cast a spell, kill him.” The other two nodded at Rodregas.
 Rodregas reached down and slid the blade under the sorcerer’s chin and said, “One spell and you die,” he then nodded to Doi’van and the Hellborn lifted his hand a few inches from Van’dret’s mouth.
 Van’dret whispered, “Please, I am bleeding.
 I need to see a healer.” Rodregas stared at the sorcerer in disbelief.
 He suffered a few minor injuries and he expected they would just go get him a healer?

His brother heard and obeyed.
 The two met at the edge of town.
 They saw scattered groups of families not far in the distance.
 “Get them, my brother,” Qurrah ordered.

 “Then they’re dead,” Harruq said, clanging his swords together.

 It’s an understatement to say all hell broke loose.
 In my opinion, it was way crazier than that.
 Kojas sidestepped my arrow and it disappeared somewhere in the trees.
 Emily raised her hands and roots twisted upward, trying to encase Kojas but he kept slashing them away.

 I wanted to give Rachel a big hug, or maybe just break into tears right then and there.

 Rachel caught up with me before I made it very far.
 "Adriana, are you okay?
 Don't you want a ride home?"
 I turned towards her to respond and just broke down.
 She pulled me into an open classroom and gave me a hug while I tried to explain about the two failed tests, my birthday, and how much I missed my Dad and Cindi.

“Do you know of a woman named Aurelia?” he asked anyway.
 “Aurelia?” the elf asked.
 “Why in all of Dezrel would you be looking for her?”
 “She, um, I kind of…” The half-orc faltered.
 “I owe her a favor.”
 The elf smiled as if trying to appear amused, but it faltered miserably.

I could probably deal with not having a boyfriend, even assuming that was what we were right now.
 Going half a year without anyone to talk to because my mom was wrapped up with her art and everyone else in the town thought I was stuck-up would be more than I could take.
 The thought was enough to leave me speechless for the entire drive home.
 Brandon seemed content to leave me alone with my thoughts as he sped around the various turns at speeds that normally would've made me protest.
 As I went to leave the car, he grabbed me by my back pocket, which nearly made me shriek in surprise.
 "Hey, you know what you need to put all this in perspective?"
 "No, but then I think it's more than just a matter of my perspective being off."
 My fear of alienating him had almost vanished in the rush of indignation over how he'd grabbed me.
 I wanted to say something even more snarky, but there was just enough worry left to curb my tongue.

The deadly nickname.
 Apparently I'd only thought I was doing better.
 The good feeling I'd gotten from helping Jackie had just been the deceptive crust of ice hiding the sub-zero deathtrap below.
 My desk was too far away.
 I wanted to try and gut it out, but the emotional extremes from the day had been too draining.
 I slumped into the empty chair next to Rachel and tried to concentrate on my breathing.
 Maybe I could lessen its impact, somehow have a mini-attack that made my mind blank out, but left me enough control over my body to remain seated in the chair.
 Rachel grabbed my arm, disrupting my concentration.

Steve is now serving five years in prison.
 The last I heard about Ashley is that she is prostituting herself to support her drug habit.
 NARCONON: Information about Narconon is readily available on the Internet; the official site explains the theories of detoxification, based on the work of L. Ron Hubbard.
 Brandon: Sadly, as he neared the 2-year sobriety mark, Brandon relapsed.
 I immediately knew just by talking to him over the phone.
 I wouldn’t have noticed the changes in his behavior had I not come to know the new sober Brandon after his treatment at Narconon and his subsequent employment at the facility.
 Brandon reluctantly agreed to return to Narconon to try to discover “what he had missed” but he didn’t go easily.
 Drug addicts are convinced that they can handle the issue themselves and believing that lie could prove deadly for them.
 Brandon spent three more months in treatment and is now trying again, living independently in a sober-living environment.

This sector is as amenable to stimulation by government policies as agriculture or manufacturing, and it also provides impetus for the growth of other sectors.
 Supportive policies have enabled trade, transport and other services to generate more than 50 per cent of all jobs in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.
 Services have produced more than half of all job growth in many other Asian nations, including private day-care centres, nursery schools and computer training institutes, which are multiplying rapidly in many countries, but can be expanded much further.
 India has adopted an innovative, low-cost, self-employment strategy to expand availability of long-distance telecommunications services by setting up small private telephone and fax centres throughout the country.
 Informal private service enterprises in construction, commerce, food catering, repair and transport have vast growth potential.
 Rapid expansion of education, training and public health, especially rural health and education, can also serve as a conscious strategy for employment generation.
 Technology of organization
 Much emphasis is placed on the widening gap in technology between North and South, but the gap in the technology of organization is even greater.
 Creation of new types of systems and organizations can create markets and jobs in many ways.
 The Dutch system of flower auction co-operatives is so successful that 68 per cent of the entire world’s exports of cut flowers pass through markets in the Netherlands.

"Now why would we do a thing like that when we all know you're a dead man?"
 Dominic stopped just outside of what I was starting to understand was pouncing range for people who happened to have supernatural strength, as Alec gave Brandon a cold smile.
 "If I ever really decide the outcome is a foregone conclusion, you'd better start watching out for your people.
 You'd be surprised just how many of them could disappear if I no longer worried about the consequences of my actions."
 The tingle of Alec's power lessened slightly once we were out of sight, but it still hadn't dropped off completely by the time we were standing in front of Mrs. Tiggs' classroom.

The four of us loitered under streetlamps listening to their pitch about the glories of San Francisco.

 On our way home, strung out on fatigue and more coffee, I babbled about how, guided by Kerouac, we had risen above routine, learned to outrun the sheep and phonies and to create our own destiny.
 “We’re well on our way to being Supermen,” I boasted.
 I prophesied that as soon as we got released from high school and were no longer branded juveniles, life would turn into a banquet.

I will write about reading Brother Lawrence and this trip before the next novel or anything else gets in my way.
 And by the end, I vow, I will know better how to adore God.
 Which, for reasons I’ll soon learn, turns me once again to thoughts of Eric.
 After a mile or so I’m questioning whether, on that Sunday as he walked over the hill between Sylvia's house and Kenny Niedermeyer's, Eric got handed the choice to save me and/or Billy, or to save himself.
 The only answer I receive is a maybe.
 But all I need is to recognize the long shot possibility that the dearest person I have known gave his life for me and, despite the sorrow, my heart leaps with adoration.
 For a moment on Highway 101 in Pismo Beach, I feel sure that Eric was Jesus.
 Not in full, as in a Second Coming.
 But in a way so that Jesus entered him and took possession.
 While this thought grips me, both Eric and Jesus become so precious the word adore feels timid and weak.

 “The Guild is supposed to be trying to make their Immortalists members Celestial.
 Why would they hold you for two years?” Doi’van nodded but then shook his head.
 “Trust me, I would like to know that answer more then you.” Doi’van’s smile was now long gone and with a shrug of his huge misshaped shoulders, he changed the subject.

 There was a good-size tree not far in front of the two of them.

 He looked at Doi’van and not at the caravan.
 There was no need for both of them to be peeking around the trees at the caravan, though he desperately wanted to get a good look at the caravan to establish their odds.

Me vs. Everybody
 About a year ago, in church, the band performed “Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing”.
 Some words from the second verse leapt out at me.
 “Jesus sought me when a stranger, wandering from the throne of God, He to rescue me from danger, bought me with his precious blood.”
 And for the first time ever, I thought, my God, Eric died for me.
 I believe our minds go far deeper than the part that allows us to reason.
 When we encounter an idea and it seems to brighten our consciousness and lead to a wealth of new insights, we should trust it at least as much as we trust a reasoned argument.
 Because if we look close enough at almost any reasoned argument, we can find a flaw or logical fallacy.

 If I'd had anything even remotely better to do with my Friday night, I would have done it.
 I didn't, so I started with the stuff that we'd piled in the living room because it was marginally cooler downstairs.

We were standing outside the rear of her house.
 She slid the false wall back in place and grabbed my arm again, our heavy cloaks moving like shadows as we ran from the village.
 We didn’t go far before she stopped and jerked me into a squat beside her.
 There was movement a brief distance ahead, a rabbit weaving from the cover of one rock to the next.
 As I watched, a stick shot from the ground and speared the animal through the chest, killing it instantly.
 I gasped.
 Ruby giggled at me.
 She grabbed her quarry and we rushed back to the house.
 We went to the main room and she started a fire as she easily skinned and gutted the animal.
 The entrails went into an urn beside the fire and I wondered what she used them for before remembering all the containers on her bedroom shelf with a shudder.

 It was not just adrenaline that caused Harruq’s hands to shake, but Qurrah put his hand on his wrist and begged him to calm.

 “Let it burn in you.
 Let it be a reminder of what I have always said.
 We are better, superior.
 Never feel guilt at what we do to them, for you see what they would do to us.”
 Harruq stood, brushed some dirt from his pants, and then offered Qurrah a hand.

 I shouldn't have been surprised when she turned out to be right.
 The new chapter was on probability, which had absolutely nothing to do with the stuff they'd been working on the week before.
 I quickly decided I didn't like the new stuff as much as what I'd been studying on my own, but it was relatively easy, and almost before I knew it class had ended and it was time to go to lunch.
 My doubts about whether or not everyone would be back in school today after three nights of partying were quickly resolved as Britney and I tried to fight through the ridiculous foot traffic on our way to our lockers.
 By the time we made it to the lunch room, I was heartily sick of dodging jocks with shoulders the size of an ox.
 Why on earth did every single one of them think it was necessary to mock fight, throw balls back and forth to each other, or otherwise make a spectacle of themselves?
 My mood was further soured as we arrived to find an unmistakable circle of bystanders signaling an impending fight.
 My first instinct was to go find a teacher before the two idiots hurt each other, but while I was still looking around to see if there was an adult in the room, Britney grabbed my arm and pulled me towards the circle.

 "But I'm just a normal person.
 Why would I appear different than anyone else?"
 Alec's shrug was enough to send my heart racing again, but not enough to distract me from his words.
 "With shape shifters, we believe it's because the animating energy, the soul if you will, burns more brightly than normal.
 I think it's tied in with what allows us to shift forms.

 I still called Thomas in Sacramento often, as family is family, and he was about all I had left in that category and he was all I had growing up.
 He was my big brother and there was no changing that.
 I tried to forgive him for the part he played in my business failure, but I never confronted him; I just buried my resentment.
 When I did visit his home it was hard for him to hide the bounty of furnishings that adorned his drug kingpin house.
 Many of his belongings had obviously come from my defunct store.
 Thomas was dealing drugs on a very large scale and was about to be busted.
 There were a couple of occasions when I was at his home in Sacramento when the cocaine was piled so high on his glass top dining table that you needed to be careful that it did not slide off on the floor.

The most striking testimony to this fact is the history of employment in USA, arguably the country that has most readily and fully adopted new technologies over the past century.
 Employment in manufacturing and mining grew to a peak of about 40 per cent of the workforce after World War II before beginning its downward spiral to 15 per cent by 2000, about the same proportion as in 1850.
 Yet, during this same period total employment in America has expanded phenomenally, from a mere 13 million workers in 1870 to 68 million in 1955 and more than 136 million in 2002.
 In spite of all the automation and all the export of jobs to lower wage economies, the percentage of the American population employed has continued to rise over time.
 Several factors are responsible for this result, among which population growth and technological development are most prominent.
 Rising levels of technological sophistication certainly displace workers in most fields of manufacturing.
 But at the same time they stimulate growth of employment in many different ways – increasing demand for the products thus manufactured by a factor of 10, 100 or even 1000 fold as in the case of automobiles, TVs, cell phones and computers; increasing the demand for research workers to support technological innovation and for teachers to meet the rising demand for education; and rising living standards, which increases consumption of other goods and services due to the falling prices made possible by rising productivity.
 Over the past two decades the US economy lost nearly 4 million manufacturing jobs but added a net 37 million jobs through expansion of the service sector, which now accounts for 84 per cent of total employment.
 It is time that we stop resisting or resenting this trend, but rather strive to adapt by shifting our focus toward those fields of employment which are most directly stimulated by technological innovation.
 Export of commercial services already accounts for 20 per cent of world trade.

The United States spends three times as much on welfare payments as it does on retraining the unemployed.
 For three decades, Sweden achieved the highest employment rate among OECD countries based on 'the passionate belief in full employment' and 'the right to work' and on active policies to generate work for all, rather than payments to the unemployed.
 Drawing lessons from the Swedish model, introduce a comprehensive programme of education and vocational preparedness for the unemployed, compulsory retraining for those who are unemployed for more than six months, and a strictly managed penalty system for unemployed persons who refuse successive job offers and do not seek retraining.
 7.Improve labour market information and job placement systems: Labour markets are becoming more and more fluid.
 One in ten jobs is now replaced in OECD countries every year.
 This makes the strengthening of job placement systems a crucial element in any full employment strategy.
 Lack of access to information about job or training opportunities retards re-employment.
 Sweden operates one of the most extensive and efficient employment services, in close cooperation with business, that is responsible for filling 60 per cent of total job vacancies.
 Improve labour market information systems within and between countries by increasing the accuracy and comparability of data, requiring mandatory reporting by businesses of all sizes, and freely exchanging information between cities, states and countries on successful employment-generating strategies.
 8.Raise minimum standards for education: Higher education increases productivity, raises personal expectations and consumption, and generates additional jobs in education and elsewhere.

 The Danger of Watching Joan of Arcadia
 In Oregon, I’m speeding alongside one of the many wide and glistening rivers and gazing across at concentric rows of emerald hills at intervals topped with lacy clouds when I catch myself admiring them to such a degree I could call it worship.
 Then something reminds me to turn from worshiping the creation to worshiping its creator.
 To adore a feeling or state of mind, such as the revelation of beauty in nature or the way a lover makes me feel, may involve nothing but selfishness.
 But to adore the creator of that feeling, God for creating nature, a lover for giving me a piece of her heart, or parents for providing warmth and safety, that is appreciation, gratitude, untainted by the selfishness that all sin is made of.
 Maybe if I practice this exercise, try to catch myself in each act of admiration, and turn my worship to the creator, I will gradually learn to adore God the father, and God the spirit.
 But for now, my thoughts drift back to Eric.

It would also eliminate the need for missile defence systems, which no nation can afford and which are the only possible defence against ballistic missile weapons.
 The ban on use should be followed by urgent measures to dismantle and scrap this entire class of weapons worldwide.
 9.Highest priority must be given to controlling and reversing the proliferation of small arms in line with the determined international measures employed to curb hijacking.
 As an immediate first step, these weapons should be classified and a UN register created to monitor their manufacture and sale.
 Agreements should be negotiated between major arms suppliers to severely restrict production and sales.
 Strong sanctions must be instituted to discourage states from actively or passively abetting small arms proliferation, especially to non-state actors.
 10.UN action to curb the international trade in major armaments needs to go further than the existing Arms Register.
 Arms exports to areas identified by the UN as trouble spots should be banned by international law.
 An independent agency should be established to verify the submissions from arms-exporting states.
 Major arms exporters should agree to consult the Security Council in advance about large orders received for destabilizing weapons and, where appropriate, coordinate actions to limit the size of arms transfers.

, therefore, to deliver stockpiles of these weapons far as possible from those leading inevitably to war. The following key principles should be reinforced in the Mv 10 warning: 9.

Small gusts of air rolled off the dragon’s wings that blew Emily’s hair in her face.

Now though, it felt more reassuring than threatening.
 The rest of Les Misérables was even better than I'd hoped.
 Minutes and seconds went by faster than at any other time in my life.
 As the curtain finally came down, I brushed away the traces of tears that'd appeared on my face during the performance, and turned in my seat as the lights came up.
 Alec was gone.
 The drapes were swaying gently as if they'd been brushed by someone moving quickly, but other than that there was no trace of him.
 It wasn't until I'd filed out into the grand foyer, eager to spend a few minutes taking in the gorgeous bronze statues liberally scattered throughout the room, that I realized why I felt so odd.
 Part of the difference was the normal sensation of having vicariously been part of something larger than life.

Weapons.

 What more could we ever ask for?”
 “Yeah, what else,” Harruq said, shifting more of his brother’s weight onto his shoulder.
 Qurrah’s eyes drooped, and it seemed sleep would steal him away before they reached town.
 Harruq found his blades without too much trouble.
 He laid Qurrah down.
 His brother slept peacefully, and in silence the half-orc took the old weapons into his hands.
 He looked to the stars.
 Even as a child, those far away lights had awakened something in him, something so different from what he thought he was.

I'd seen him several times before, but didn't have a name to go with his aristocratic features.
 "That's enough, Vincent."
 A trace of rebelliousness flared up at Brandon's chastisement, but Vincent buried it so quickly I almost didn't have enough time to classify it before it disappeared.
 Interestingly enough, I could see Cassie out of the corner of my eye, and she didn't look any happier than Vincent.
 The rest of lunch flew by.
 I'd never realized how much fun it could be to belong to a group.
 Things weren't ideal; I'd never met a group with so many inside jokes.
 Half the time I felt like there was an entire conversation being carried on over my head, but sitting next to Brandon left me with such a tingly feeling all along my right side that I didn't really mind.
 Not even the presence of a pop quiz in History managed to faze me.
 Almost before I knew it I was sitting down in Physics.

Guy was drunk out of his mind, so when I told him we could win four gold coins he should have figured something was off.
 “We met after work, just past sundown, and I led him straight to Qurrah, who cast a spell on Perry then, kind of like you did with the guards.
 He shouted until his head turned purple but made no sound for the effort.
 Then Qurrah cast another spell that made him go all tough and rigid.
 Felt like I was holding a stick.
 We took him inside and put him on the floor.
 “He wasn’t supposed to die,” Harruq said, staring right into Aurelia’s eyes so she would know he spoke the truth.

 She'd loved the pizza they'd had last night.

 Rick would probably have refused to go if he hadn’t met Sharon this weekend.
 He didn’t feel particularly attracted to her, but she was a nice girl, and that was a big improvement over his last few experiences.
 That evening he went out to the garden with the book Teri had given him.
 Sharon had been enthusiastic about the dance when he’d called to invite her.
 He’d told her he’d lend her the book, but she said that she already had some ideas about finding a drop-waist dress and a cloche hat.
 Personally, he thought the clothes were rather ugly.
 The dresses were shapeless, and the men’s pants were baggy.
 And he certainly wasn’t going to wear a raccoon coat.

 "She was just looking inside you to see if you've developed a power yet, wasn't she?"
 Alec helped me over an especially daunting rock and then nodded.
 "And nothing has changed.
 She's been telling me for years now that I have the potential to develop a fairly spectacular gift, one that should it choose to manifest in a useful form, could be more than a match for Brandon's strength.
 Apparently I'm still right on the point of developing said gift, only our time has run out.
 I fight Brandon tonight.
 Besides, even if I were to develop a gift this instant, most of them require practice to master, and I'm not going to have a chance to do any of that."

For a moment all three glanced about, the atmosphere akin to air before a thunderstorm.
 Qurrah broke the silence.
 “Woodhaven is behind us,” he said.
 “I have made mistakes, as has my brother.
 I saw you leave with him, and I know you sacrificed much to protect him.
 For this, I thank you.
 All I ask is that we speak naught of this again.

There was a good-size tree not far in front of the two of them.
 Rodregas put his back to it and drew his two short swords and then did the most difficult thing he could do in this situation.
 He looked at Doi’van and not at the caravan.
 There was no need for both of them to be peeking around the trees at the caravan, though he desperately wanted to get a good look at the caravan to establish their odds.
 The dice had been rolled.
 Rodregas had been learning to trust Doi’van and knew his life was now in Doi’van hands.
 If Imeralda had missed something critical and they should not attack, it was for Doi’van to catch.
 Rodregas watched Doi’van, watched for him to raise the bow and start the fight.
 When the guards charged in to stop the shooting, then it would be his turn to strike.
 Rodregas would have to take on as many of the slavers and guards as possible.

More people are working than ever before, yet at the same time more people are unemployed, because a larger proportion of the population seek jobs.
 Growing anxiety about employment prospects in the West were aggravated by a sudden 50 per cent increase in unemployment after 1990, which displaced an additional 10 million workers in the OECD and was equalled only by the previous high of 1983.
 This increase is now showing signs of reversal.
 These average figures disguise significant differences in performance of countries within the OECD.
 Since 1950, Japan’s employment rate has risen from 43 per cent to around 50 per cent, while unemployment has remained in the 1 to 3 per cent range.
 The overall proportion of the population employed in the European Community has declined by 1 per cent since 1965 and is presently just under 41 per cent, but the percentage of the working age population employed has remained more or less constant over the past three decades, at 67 per cent, whereas in other OECD regions it has risen significantly – to exceed 75 per cent in North America, Scandinavia and Japan.
 Europe’s lower labour participation rate is attributable to a number of factors.
 A far higher percentage of the European workforce was engaged in agriculture 25 years ago and has since shifted to non-agricultural sectors, an adjustment that occurred in the United States during earlier decades.
 During the 1980s Europe chose a high-wage path to growth, passing on the benefits to the existing workforce but creating relatively few new jobs; whereas the United States, with a similar economic growth rate over the decade, showed lower income growth per worker, but a steadily rising employment rate.
 Europe is now confronted with the need for structural adjustment to compensate.

Sometimes my friends and I would walk up there and visit him.
 He looked sad, sitting at this shitty little desk, with a calculator and a pencil in his hand, and bad lighting.
 It was like the stage set for some damn O’Neill play, you know, all whites and grays and shadows.
 But, he greeted us like we were the best thing he’d seen all day.
 And his boss, Mr. Waddell, was a nice guy, a heavy set, crew-cut, ex-Marine, with a face like a catcher’s mitt, and he’d always give us this big, fake hello and hand us all bubble gum.

 In Mr. Waddell’s paint store.

By the time I stood up from Jackie's desk, there were only four of us left.
 Britney was staring sullenly at her book.
 I thought about going over and seeing if she needed any help, but after helping Jackie I was feeling pretty good.
 I turned and headed back to my desk, smiling at Rachel as I passed.
 "Adri, do you have a sec?"
 The deadly nickname.
 Apparently I'd only thought I was doing better.
 The good feeling I'd gotten from helping Jackie had just been the deceptive crust of ice hiding the sub-zero deathtrap below.

The first push was brutal.
 Screams of pain and the sound of clashing of metal on metal flowed into the city.
 Harruq watched an orc wielding two swords cut off the arm of one soldier, and, as the blood from the limb splattered across his face, he turned and decapitated another with two vicious hacks.
 The orc roared in victory only to die as a soldier shoved his sword in his side and out his back.
 “Will they make it through?” Harruq asked, in awe of the display.
 Qurrah glanced over the wall and then back to the main combat.
 Archers continued eviscerating the orc forces.
 If they could push into the city, their arrows would be a nuisance at best, but it seemed they had underestimated the human soldiers.
 “They are running out of time,” Qurrah said.
 “But they might.”

Rodregas did not stop snapping it until he had the man’s face looking into the rock below.
 The three sat there for a minute and then stepped away to rest against the far wall to get some distance from Van’dret’s body.
 After a few minutes Doi’van said, “Well, one more Immortalist down, that’s good.” The other two nodded.
 Rodregas said, “We did not learn much more though.
 We still don’t really understand why they are interested in Infernal power now and willing to break The One Law.” “You mean if that is what they are doing.
 We really don’t know for sure, other than for Ravenhurr,” said Imeralda.
 Doi’van, sounding like granite, said, “I know Taiga is involved.” The other two nodded, but did not pursue that thought.
 Rodregas then said, “I agree we are just starting to figure out that there is something big going on.
 I can’t believe even the Immortalists would be crazy enough to go up against both the Celestial Gods and the Daemon Lordsof the Infernal though.” Imeralda nodded and said, “What price is so high as to be even better than God hood?” The three sat silent for a few minutes soaking in that question.
 Rodregas looked at Imeralda and asked, “Well, we can’t answer that today, but how did you break Van’dret’s spell?” Imeralda nodded and with a smile said, “I always hoped that if I had to take on a sorcerer it would be in the Forest where I would have an edge, but no, it had to be in a hallway!

 No people wandered the streets.
 No traveling merchants hawked their wares.

Helpless, the man staggered backward, clutching his wounded side.
 His eyes pleaded, but his mouth would dare not say the demeaning words.
 Harruq cut him again and again.
 His arms, his chest, his face: it all bled.
 But he remained alive, at least until that final moment when the two magic blades scissor-cut his neck.
 Harruq sheathed his swords and held the decapitated head of his foe high above him.
 Full of pride, Qurrah watched his brother roar his victory to the night sky.

Mallory's expression was far away as she spoke.
 "Yes, he would approve of the two of you.
 He's the consummate man servant, so very professional that you probably wouldn't ever know it if he didn't like you, but I'm sure he does.
 He approved of Alec's father's choice even back when most of the pack was still energetically opposed to the idea.
 He's always been one to see truly."
 "You are, I mean, you were close?"
 Her smile turned sad.
 "Actually, neither.
 We weren't close when there was an opportunity for closeness, and now that I'd like very few things more than to be close to him, there's no real opportunity for us to become so."
 She patted my hand as she shrugged.

"Here's your form, among other things."
 I verified that the top sheet had her signature on it, and then turned to go.
 She didn't let me get very far.
 "From your bewildered expression during class it appears you aren't transferring in from another school.
 I expect most of your other teachers are just letting you pick up from where they are now.
 I'm afraid this class builds on itself, so I'll be testing you on everything we've covered in the past month.
 I'm sure you've got a full class load, but we haven't gotten into anything truly difficult yet.
 The sooner we get you caught up, the better off you'll be.

 Chapter 5: Connections My disposable cell phone rings and it is Ashley.
 She tries to get me to change my location and meet her at her apartment across town.
 “I am waiting where I fucking told you I would wait.
 I am not moving anywhere,” I hissed into the crack-berry—my nickname for the phone.
 The thought of walking into some apartment and getting clunked over the head for drugs is not an option.
 This is the second time Steve and Ashley are supposed to meet me for this buy, and the last time they decided not to show after I wasted hours listening to their phone calls buying more time or trying to get me to drive somewhere else.
 “I have no intention of moving anywhere, so get your shit together or this deal is off.” I tell her this is her last chance to get the Oxy and I will be waiting in the spot I told her.
 “Hurry up, or I will sell the drugs to someone else, just like I did the last time you flaked!” I push the end call button on this cheap pre-paid cell phone that I purchased just to do this deal and I toss it onto the console of the truck.
 I didn’t want these drug dealers to know my real name or have my actual cell phone number.

She is the most beautiful person, both inside and out.
 She has been an inspiration for me and making her happy is the goal of my life.
 We are best friends, confidants, partners, and true lovers and together we are one.
 I can’t imagine my existence without her, and I know that everything I am and all I will become is shaped by her genuine kindness.
 Meeting Lisa is the most important defining moment in my life.
 Acknowledgments I would like to thank all of the drug and alcohol rehabilitation professionals who choose to tackle the daunting task of attempting to help those in this world who cannot take just one drink but must consume the whole bottle and those who cannot take a prescription pill as prescribed but must crush, snort, smoke or inject these powerful drugs to feed the monster of addiction.
 Many of these counselors and staff who help the addicts in our lives were once addicts themselves.
 They choose to “give back” because they have either finally come to understand what caused them to want to destroy themselves and are compelled to share this knowledge or they know that they can only continue their sobriety by staying where they found it, or both.
 Either way, they are the students who became the teachers of recovery and only they are bullet proof to the lies that flow so freely from an addict’s mouth.
 I would like to thank the staff of Narconon and every other facility that helps our addicts attempt to identify and handle the demon they cannot resist.

I already felt myself starting to drift away.
 Even the feeling of him caressing my check again wasn't enough to bring me all the way back to full alertness.
 "Somehow that all changed after you arrived.
 Little by little I started to realize just how empty my life really was.
 I wish I could come right out and say it while you're awake.
 I don't want that life anymore.
 I don't really want any life that doesn't involve you."
 Part of me wanted to scream for joy, to jump up out of my bed and wrap myself around Alec as tightly as I could, but I was just too far gone.
 I half thought I was dreaming it all.
 As I finally let sleep pull me down into darkness, I almost thought I heard Alec say one last thing.

Wine and food appeared on the table; Van’dret never saw it come, or the empty plates go.
 It simply was.
 The food, like everything in the tower, was of the finest quality.
 They were fed incredible grilled silver salmon, greens from the Northern Kingdoms, and small pastries from the Korin Islands.
 Taiga seemed in no hurry to get to any point, Immortalist had nothing, if not time.
 Finally, Taiga brought up the point that Van’dret believed had gained him the honor of joining Taiga in his solar.
 “So I understand that you are to journey to the Cathedral of the Heavens for this year’s open tourney?” Taiga asked his voice as melodic as one would expect from an elf, but just a tad deeper than one would think.
 “Yes, my lord, I leave in the morning,” Van’dret replied.
 “Excellent, you will have to keep your eyes open for potential talent worthy of the Immortal Guard,” Taiga stated.
 Van’dret nodded, that was one of his main responsibilities, but it could not be why he had been invited up to Taiga’s solar.

 “With but a thought it will strike as you wish,” his master told him.

I remember the movie; it was titled “The Brazilian Squatting Method.” Until then, The Exorcist was the scariest movie I had ever seen, and this beat it hands down.
 I excused myself from the room—which was filled with couples huddled together on little mats on the ground—as I began to pass out.
 I headed down the hall towards the men’s restroom and I felt myself weakening with every step.
 I pushed on the door and then the next thing I knew, I was waking up on the floor with the restroom door against my side, propping it open like a bag of sand, half of my body in the restroom and half out in the hall.
 After splashing some water in my face I returned as if nothing had happened, but I knew and I suspected that Lisa did too.
 Shortly thereafter, we entered the hospital in first time frantic labor.
 We were calmly directed to the “birthing room.” There was no turning back.
 There is no way to describe this to anyone who has not witnessed a birth.
 Those that have, know exactly what I am saying.

He wanted to deepen the kiss, to evoke the passion he knew only too well that she was capable of, but such a kiss would be torture for both of them.

He then ignored her and went back to cutting the haunch loose.
 He waited but the two lionesses seemed to have gone from aggression to napping, with him missing the transition.
 Slowly, Rodregas got up with his bear haunch and took it back to the barn.
 He met the surprised look of Doi’van and Imeralda with a half smile, “I hope you like the taste of bear?” As he was unsure of how old the meat was, he immediately started a fire and started to cook it.
 As he worked on preparing the fire he explained what had happened.
 “Are you suicidal?” asked Imeralda in an angry voice.
 “I know you felt they were not a danger, but to walk up and take the food from two Dire Cats?
 That is just asking to be killed.” Her voice was unusually high pitched and she was shaking her head in disbelief.
 “The Dire Bear must have been living in the cellar,” said Doi’van.
 “I bet they actually had to go in and kill it there.

 Things that weren't any of their business, things you weren't ready to discuss.
 Somehow I knew Rachel wouldn't pry.
 It was like keeping so many secrets for her brother had made her especially sensitive to other people's secrets.
 Another few steps brought us to the door, and I held it open for Rachel to follow me outside.
 The intense heat felt like a physical blow.
 I could almost feel my pores open up in an effort to keep me from overheating.

His great helm had a purple feather sticking out the top and he had a short, matching cape coming out the back.
 Rodregas decided that he would go after Nordien first.
 He would make sure the favorite of Ambassador Van’dret would not win if nothing else.
 If Geriodon became a knight at least an honorable man had the day.
 Several of the squires were being seen to by attendants making sure everything was secure, and waiting for the start of the match.
 Rodregas thought he was alone until he heard Imeralda speak from behind him, “Did you see who is watching from the Great Hall’s door?” she asked.
 Rodregas glanced over, it was Van’dret.
 He stood tall and handsome, young squires surrounding him ready to serve.
 Rodregas thought that the Immortalist was watching him.
 He would have to leave quickly after the tournament, as the man was growing suspicious of them.

Only the steady pressure of Alec's arm around my waist kept me from screaming, and then I was back on my feet, and being carefully, but firmly shoved through a tangled knot of bodies.
 My shoes had never been intended to allow ankles to withstand that kind of punishment.
 Even just walking had been risky, so it wasn't a surprise when my right foot slipped, and a sharp knife of pain shot through that ankle as it collapsed under me.
 Dealing with blinding agony hadn't ever been my strong point.
 I opened my mouth to scream, only to find that no sound would come out.
 The world was still spinning, but I was oriented just enough to realize that Dominic had her hand over my mouth and nose.
 I pulled at her arm, but the effort was completely futile.
 Rising panic over not being able to breathe made me hammer at the iron bar pressing me against her, but she never looked away from whatever had captured her concentration.
 Rachel suddenly appeared off to my right, and she put her finger to her lips, and then sank all ten fingernails into Dominic's arm.
 The sudden absence of the support I'd been unconsciously using to keep weight off of my right foot resulted in tear-jerking pain as the damaged appendage touched down, but I gritted my teeth and managed to keep it down to a hiss.

They all worked or read until it was too dark and than they fell asleep quickly.
 The next morning, after they had finished Morning Prayer, Rodregas said, “Alright, are you two ready for a little fighting practice?” At their nod he added, “It is always good to start with the basics.
 I thought we would go over some fighting forms.
 Are you two familiar with learning forms, also known as Kata?” he asked.
 He was expecting Imeralda to shake her head but was a little surprised that Doi’van did as well.
 He clearly knew how to fight.
 Rodregas started to explain, “Forms are a series of motions that mock fighting, but also give you an opportunity to work on balance and to visualize and understand your actions and responses to different fighting situations.
 While strength and speed are important for any kind of fighting whether it is hand-to-hand or swords fighting, good technique is all about balance and center of gravity.
 What you want to learn is to keep your center low and your balance strong even when you are tired and exhausted.” Doi’van had his normal interested expression, but Imeralda looked unconvinced.

Alec apparently read the meaning of my sudden change in expression.
 "Don't worry; I'm not going to send you back alone.
 We'll make sure nothing happens to you."
 Too scared to even muster a "yeah right, they all hate me," I simply waited while Alec flipped open an ultra-slender cellphone, and made two calls.
 He spoke too quietly for me to make out exactly what was being said.
 It seemed like he was giving orders though, and that they weren't being received very well.
 A few minutes later Alec bundled me into the back seat of an unfamiliar car, which rapidly filled up as first Jasmin, Isaac and the tiny Hispanic girl arrived.
 Jasmin completely ignored me as she climbed into the car; Isaac gave me a polite, if somewhat cool nod.
 The Hispanic girl gave me an honest-to-goodness smile as she slipped behind the steering wheel and started the engine.
 In what was one of the most thoughtful things that'd happened all night, she turned the heater on full as she pulled out of the driveway.

As much as I try, I cannot visualize my father, Richard, in any setting.
 I remember my mother, my brother, grandparents, babysitters, uncles, friends, and different events but I just can’t place my father anywhere.
 My parents divorced in the early sixties and my brother Thomas and I were very young.
 We took a train ride from Kansas to California; my mother told us we were on an adventure.
 We were far too young to comprehend divorce so there was no reason for her to explain.
 Our dogs, Ringo and Trixie, were caged in the back of the train, surrounded by luggage.
 To get to them, it required passing through a designated men’s area—occupied by men only.
 My mother could not accompany us.
 Smoke filled the air and men of all different types stared at Thomas and me as we huddled together passing through their compartment.

Rodregas walked back up the stairs and he thought that it would be a good idea to feed the beasts first, but he did not have time to grab a couple of chickens in the coop next to the kitchen.
 The sooner he was away from the keep the better.
 As Rodregas walked up to the watchtower gates he once again wore the sorcerer’s robe that Captain Poir had fetched for him, but this time he wore it outside of his armor.
 He climbed the inner stairs until he stepped into the watchtower room at the top.
 He played it bold, walked up to the staring guard and signaled him to turn around.
 Then Rodregas proceeded to gag and bind him.
 The confused guard did not even struggle.
 Next, Rodregas went to the front gate and repeated his actions with the lone guard at the gate; he then picked him up and took him to sit with his friend at the top of the gate.
 He made sure both were securely tied up and blindfolded and took off their weapon harnesses and kept them; their two short swords were nicer than the ones that he had taken from the armory.
 Both men also had purses with them that jingled with their bonus money in a promising way.

A part of him worried he might wake his brother, but he was too drained to care.
 “Why did she do that?
 She could have run faster without the child!”
 No, he knew that answer.
 She would not abandon her child just as he would not abandon Qurrah.
 Then what was bothering him so?
 He fell to his knees and stabbed the old weapons into the dirt.
 The faces of those he had killed danced before his eyes, especially the mother and her child, and the young girl holding her little sister.
 The fear in their eyes.

He wanted me to wear it in our ceremony.
 I had never agreed to the union, but I avoided telling him it was not possible.
 It would be only valid in his mind.
 But then again, what would that hurt?
 I accepted the dress from him, looking it over.
 It was poorly made and ill-fitting, but had potential as a design.
 I sat, using magic to work on the seaming and arrange the pearl strands and beading in a more pleasant pattern while deciding how best to deal with him.

“About a hundred,” Qurrah said.
 “But what are they?”
 “Elves,” the man in black said.

The rest of the class period should have been enjoyable.
 My group had the right answer, which I'd come up with on my own, and we were now learning about leverage, mechanical advantage, and friction, all of which were actually pretty interesting.
 I studiously ignored Alec, even though I could all but feel him glaring at me the entire time.
 When the bell finally rang, Mrs. Alexander looked up from her white board with a startled expression.
 "I suppose that's it then.
 Don't forget to turn in your assignments on your way out."
 Anxious to make sure I got credit for all the work I'd done, I hurried up to the front of the class before Alec could get to his feet.
 "Oh, Adriana.
 It looks like you've been busy."

It was entirely different when you weren't sure you could trust the people around you.
 Brandon was too good to be true.
 I pretty much expected any day now he'd come to his senses and realize he could do a lot better.
 Right or not, it's hard to really become emotionally invested when you feel like that.
 Rachel on the other hand should have been the perfect friend, but I got the feeling she'd always choose her brother over me.
 I felt guilty for holding that against her, family should be important.
 Cindi's friends back in Minnesota had probably felt similarly, but I'd always been really careful not to make her choose between me and them.
 Alec seemed like the type who'd force a decision just because he could.
 I felt my heart go crazy at the same time tears started gathering at the corner of my eyes.
 It was stupid to have risked a panic attack when I was already borderline depressed, but that was what I was looking at now.

ular, that was how I've always felt. I knew I should have gotten over Brandon right away, but I felt more sick than the reason in my stomach. I was not ready for anything else.

 “But clearly he already has a greater sigil; no man can fight like that who does not have one.
 He is an impostor.
 He steals this knighthood from more deserving squires,” Van’dret said.
 At this Rodregas saw many people nodding, but he remained silent.
 It was not his turn to answer any question other than from the Grand Marshal.
 The Marshal Faurrenida voice made his displeasure and his dislike of arguing with a non-knight clear as he said, “While a knight has the full right to enter both the Lesser and Greater Sigil Chambers and take and sigil as his level of magic might allow, it is not a sigil he earns today.
 It is knighthood.

 I sighed.
 What choice did I have?
 And then I laughed, because I couldn’t even trust myself.
 I expected him to look at me like I was mad.
 Instead, he looked like it was… endearing.

He told Kenny to leave Billy and me at home.
 In some way he wanted to spare us.
 I used to suppose he hadn't exactly known his motive, only felt that whatever was coming at him, we shouldn’t have to witness.
 The only sense I could make of it all was that something way beyond reason or observation took place in his heart, mind or spirit.
 According to some mysterious cosmic whimsy or brutal plan, Eric had to die and I didn’t.
 So I filed the matter away with other mysteries, of which life offers plenty.
 But on this trip with all its remembering, I may solve the mystery.
 The End of Something Else
 A couple weeks after Eric's funeral, Cliff and I decided we should quit school and move to San Francisco.
 When school let out that day, we went up the street to La Mesa Junior High and found my mom grading papers on the patio behind her classroom.

 on a Saturday morning. She was usually there at 6 noon, but from 8:30 to 10:00 she had called a check. Her works became overtime.

Emily, dear, can you put your laundry away?
 After you do that, you can hang out in your room.” Emily nodded and disappeared inside.
 Her mom moved aside so I could walk in.
 I unlaced my sneakers and walked up the stairs, looking at the flower paintings hung along the wall that her mom had painted in her spare time.
 I pushed open Emily’s bedroom door to see her stuffing her clothes in the drawer and flopping onto the bed.
 She pulled out my bag and threw it to me so I could set up my sleeping bag on her rug.

I had not seen them either, before they were approaching their masters.
 They came forward to snarl, one regarding Ruby and one Steed, and I could only be glad it wasn’t me as their muzzles pulled back and exposed a vicious set of teeth, complete with meat-tearing fangs.
 The hair rose on their backs and I was suddenly positive they were larger than Ruby.
 A horrific growl ripped from their chests in unison and I cringed.
 Then, at once, they settled back into relaxed seated positions as if they had never been angry.
 “We also do not do tricks.” Yes, there was humor there.
 I was relieved to see the intimidating pair might not be as strict as I’d imagined.
 “We will return to watch.” They inclined their heads and walked out of the circle in unison, disappearing from view.

 There were five shots that you had to make: a man shaped target at twenty paces, a crouching man shape at thirty, a standard round target in a hay bail at forty, and another round target at fifty paces and finally there was a round target dragged in hops and jumps across the field with a rope pulled by squires.
 As the first round of contestants lined up behind the rope to shoot, Rodregas watched the technique of the better archers and mentally went through Imeralda’s advice.
 She was all about breathing; she claimed that keeping your eyes where you wanted the arrow to go and releasing the string at two-thirds of the way through your exhale was the best way to hit your target.
 Rodregas became nervous as he waited.
 He was very impressed by the quality of the archery on display.
 Clearly everyone knew what they were about.
 He ended up being behind a tall young man.
 Rodregas almost thought he might have some AElf blood.

“The healers have cleaned the wounds and cast their healing chants and spells, but I think some of them won’t make it.
 I think we should use the minor Sigil of Healing on them, at least the most critical of them.” She paused at Rodregas’ surprised look and then quickly added, “I know it is illegal for anyone but the Immortalists or the Order to use sigils, but that is a law made by the Immortalists!” “But Imeralda,” said Doi’van, “the final competition of the tournament is tomorrow and he is very close to earning knighthood and a greater sigil.” Though he spoke in opposition his tone was flat as if he simply weighed facts.
 Rodregas froze for a moment, and then simply nodded.
 He had made this decision the moment he took on a body that was not his.
 He was either a monster now, or he was a warrior fighting for justice.
 He struggled up to his feet and said, “Go get the figurine out of my trunk, keep it hidden.
 Doi’van and I will meet you outside of the infirmary.” Rodregas was pleased that neither Doi’van nor Imeralda actually looked surprised.
 He was not the only one who had decided that someone had to start doing the right thing and that they were those people.
 As Rodregas and Doi’van met Imeralda outside the infirmary doors, he could hear the sound of people in pain coming through the doors.
 The sight inside was not pretty.

I strung my bow and released an arrow.
 It pierced the frost beast’s pelt and it fell to the ground.
 Emily turned to me with huge, confused eyes.
 She mouthed the words, thank you.
 I nodded in response.
 Jason threw his knife at the troll and it landed in its leg.
 The troll collapsed on the ground and Emily raised her hands in the air.
 The ground rumbled and the troll disappeared in the dirt.

Adult literacy rates in the least developed nations still average less than 50 per cent and are less than half that in a number of countries.
 Unless more intensive efforts are made, worldwide the absolute number of the illiterate will decline only marginally by the year 2000.
 Illiteracy is likely to increase by 10 per cent in South Asia – home to more than 40 per cent of the world’s illiterate – and by nearly 7 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa.
 Although universal primary education has been a goal for decades and primary education has been made compulsory in most countries, 128 million children living in remote rural areas, urban slums and refugee camps – representing 20 per cent of the total school-age population – are still excluded from primary education.
 Unless greater measures are introduced, this number may rise to more than 160 million by the turn of the century.
 Achieving true universality of primary education by the year 2000 will require a massive investment in school buildings, teachers and instructional materials for an additional 230 million school-age children.
 An additional 4 million teachers will be required, 20 per cent more than in 1990.
 In sub-Saharan Africa, gross primary enrolment will have to double before year 2000 to achieve this goal.
 In addition to the quantitative deficiency in educational enrolment and achievements, the quality of teaching facilities, materials and staff is severely deficient in many countries.
 Most developing countries hire teachers with only a secondary school certificate and a minimum of teachers’ training.

But, Rodregas, they have Forest and Earth Nymphs and several are children.
 I was raised among AElfin, but these are my people.
 I wish we could do something.“ Rodregas nodded his understanding and said, “I wish we could, but the three of us against a score, the chances of our success is far smaller than the chances of our death.” He stated in the ‘matter of fact’ sergeant voice that he knew people would follow.
 Rodregas stood up and started to turn, but while Doi’van stood he faced the road and he said, “I have been on this road before, though I did not know then that it was called ‘The Princess Road.’ To me it was a road of sorrow.” Doi’van was using that flat voice that he used when stating facts.
 “Rodregas, you said our odds are bad, but how long shall we wait for the odds to be good?” Doi’van’s voice dropped the flat tone and started to sound like rocks groaning deep in the earth, as if a great earthquake was coming, “You believe that a god of the Celestials is behind your survival and that this god wants to see us fight the Immortalists.
 I spent two years of my life in the Menagerie, I swore to myself that given a chance I would see no others be enslaved by the Lord Taiga.” Doi’van continued speaking with the same tone as if the earth shook, “I know these caravans.
 The guards will be mostly badly trained human scum armed in leather and with weapons of simple steel.
 The Immortalist scouts are another matter.
 They will be highly trained but still the lowest of the Immortal Guards, mostly with just one or two of the lesser sigils such as strength or one that gives him enhanced senses.
 Against the three of us, a Forest Nymph with a powerful Black Yew bow and a Hellborn Prince of the Orqui and a warrior empowered with a Celestial Lion, are the odds truly that bad?” Rodregas stood still, surprised by Doi’van’s words.

I closed my eyes as a wave of heat started at my collarbones and rushed up to the tips of my ears.
 I wanted to throw up, except that would be even more embarrassing than being carried out of class by the most popular boy in school.
 I opened my eyes and found we were already out in the hall.
 Alec's stride was so smooth it was hard to believe we weren't still back in the classroom.
 "Put me down, I mean please put me down."
 Those clear, deep eyes met mine for a second, seeming to look past the surface and all the way down to the bleeding mental gash that'd just triggered my most recent collapse.
 I was trying to marshal my arguments, but his eyes wiped my mind clean.
 I couldn't form another coherent thought until he shook his head and looked away.

Harruq ripped his blade out of the guard’s chest and shoved the body to the side.
 The dying heap of flesh collided against two other men, knocking them back and delaying their attack.
 He mocked them, adrenaline flooding his veins.
 “Is that all you can do?” he screamed.
 “Where’s the fun in this?”
 “Here’s your fun,” one said, stabbing at Harruq’s side from behind.
 The blade punctured the black armor and bit into flesh.
 The half-orc roared, and then twisted so fast it left the expert guard breathless.
 His upper body jerked left to prevent the sword from going in any further.
 Salvation swung around, ringing against the blade.

 “What do you mean, you haven’t found him yet?” “I crashed into Jazell, who was doing, like, forty,” Jason pointed to me.
 “Then we both found you fighting beasts with your fiery fingertips of death.” She raised an eyebrow.
 “Fiery fingertips of death?” “Hey,” he shrugged, “Jazell’s sarcasm is contagious.” “Anyway, we better find Seth before he gets into some serious trouble,” I said, and walked off.
 I went farther down the hill and the fighting spread out more.

Everyone is seated and the service is ready to begin.
 Once the sermon begins, though, guess what is back?
 Yep, we can hear the helicopter, but we can’t see it through trees and tent.
 The noise gets louder and louder and it suddenly drops down behind the podium.
 The wind from the swirling blades intensifies and the flower displays that sit on tripods start to fall forward and the tent begins to rattle and shake, the wind starts to uproot the tent from the stakes which anchor it.
 The helicopter is facing us and begins to slowly maneuver to expose its side.
 The tent is ripped from the ground and tumbles away leaving a clear view of the black helicopter that is lowering itself closer to the ground.
 The helicopter is about thirty feet above the ground, and now just behind the podium, over the limos.
 The side door slides open revealing two men in black suits.

 Brazenly, they approached the campfire.
 They kept their weapons sheathed and hidden.
 The closer they got before the men panicked the better.
 “Halt, who goes there?” one of the guards shouted to them as they neared.
 They wore polished chainmail shining red in the firelight.
 The crest of Neldar adorned their tabards.
 Longswords hung from their belts.

“Don't count me out.” I stood up and faced Seth with Emily and Jason.

 “But you better not keep anything else from us or Kojas won't be your problem.” She winked at him and set off with Jason on her heels.
 I think they were going to start arguing about the water war.
 “Great job Seth!” I said and hugged him.

The bark was peeling off and I could see the tree branches leaning towards the ground.
 The air was cold and heavy, like a mound of snow on your shoulders.
 The trees parted to show a cliff.
 We walked up to the edge and the wind whipped at my face.
 A feeling of déjà vu came upon me.
 I knew where we were because I had been here before.
 “Seth, I was here in my dream, the one with Kojas and the dwarf,” I said.
 His eyes widened and he looked down at the ground below, obviously trying to imagine what it had looked like.

The colossal cost of armaments and the catastrophic destruction of war are incompatible with the achievement of prosperity for all.
 Peace has become the fundamental imperative for development.
 War as an Instrument of Policy
 Humanity has lived with war for so many millennia that it is difficult to imagine a world without it.
 Even in the four decades of ‘peace’ following the Second World War, approximately 160 inter-state and intra-state wars, including 100 major conflicts, have been fought in developing countries, leading directly to 20 million deaths – half of them caused by the armed forces of developed countries in Korea, Indochina, Algeria and other anti-colonial wars – and to another 20 million war-related casualties.
 These massive casualties during a time of ‘peace’ are roughly equal to the total casualties incurred by all the countries of the world during the last world war.
 An equally disturbing phenomenon has been the expansion of violence within society for political purposes.
 Of the 82 armed conflicts between 1989 and 1992, only three were between states.
 During 1993, 42 countries were involved in 52 major conflicts, and another 37 experienced political violence.
 Terrorist warfare, whose principal aim is to threaten social peace, has become the model for conflicts in Northern Ireland, the Middle East and the drug war in Colombia.

He expected to see his body dead in the street, for why else had he still not returned?
 He held hope that Harruq still fought against his enemies, or that more had come beyond the three the elf had claimed.
 What he was not prepared for was the sight of Harruq hunched over the dying body of Aurelia Thyne.
 “Harruq,” he tried to call out.
 The flesh in the back of his throat tore.
 Blood poured down his throat, slick and hot.
 Qurrah cursed.
 Such a wound would kill him if he did not seek help.
 He needed to steal more life, and for that, he needed another body.
 He glanced behind.

 "It doesn't.

Jim – Dad, its Gene…
 Art – A stupid question on my part.
 More precisely then, what does he have in mind?
 Jim – He didn’t say.
 And he wasn’t in the mood to be pressed.
 So be on the lookout for Gene, he seems to have been a little preoccupied with whatever he needs to talk with you about.
 Art – He wasn’t in trouble was he?

Rick glanced at his watch.
 She'd been in the garden for 20 minutes.
 It was foggier than usual--was that an indication that there'd be a door or window or whatever back to 1927?
 Now that he'd told her he loved her, had opened his heart to her completely, he couldn't bear the thought that she might not walk back into his arms.
 So when he at last saw her moving through the fog, he ran to snatch her up.
 "Marie," he sighed into her hair.
 She could barely breathe but didn't want to be released.
 When he at last set her down, she continued to cling to him.
 "I wish you didn't have to go to work today."
 He was surprised by her words.

92m like0m they were her own. He didn't know who truly held her, but he knew that it were his own strong and strong heart that was holding him.

Rodregas saw that Korin noticed the study door, though he was working hard to not show it.
 “How many?” Rodregas repeated his question.
 “I am not sure,” Korin said.
 “For us to truly become divine we must of course develop our skills.” As Korin answered the question he took a step back.
 Rodregas quickly stepped forward and pushed him hard against the wall.
 Korin hit with a hard smack and slid to the ground, hurt, but not badly.
 Rodregas slammed the door closed and relocked it.
 Then he quickly reached down and covered Korin’s mouth, pulled him up, and slipped behind him.
 Rodregas saw Korin’s bulging eyes as he tried to get a better look at his captor.

"This is Rick's.
 Please don't ever let Hattie wash it or the shirt."
 She nodded toward the t-shirt on the pillow.
 Mrs. Tranton gazed down at her for a moment.
 "I'm sorry, darling."
 She kissed Marie's forehead and left.
 Marie curled up next to Rick's t-shirt still clutching his handkerchief.
 She felt so empty.
 She didn't sleep well that night but woke up early nevertheless.
 After bathing, she put on her emerald underwear and a simple white dress and went out into the garden.

Then I remember a strange idea from the philosopher Blaise Pascal, a line from his book Penses, which contends not only is Jesus alive, he continues to be crucified for our sins.
 So, maybe Christ didn’t only die for us way back in time, but he's still dying for us.
 “Wow,” I mumble, “if you can’t adore that fellow, you’re really a hard case.”
 Laura's Birthday
 First period Monday, I got called to Mrs. Bole’s office.
 I knocked, stepped in, and found her slumped over her desk.
 Though she was big and hearty, today she looked undone, like a visitor to Auschwitz.
 “Sit down, Kenneth.” “What’d I do?” “It’s about Eric.” Studying her mournful eyes, I eased myself into the chair.
 “Yeah?” “They crashed.” My heart stopped and I gave up breathing.
 “Eric?” I gasped.

I almost said no, but as he pulled me in towards him, I suddenly realized just how badly I wanted to touch his incredibly hard chest and shoulders.
 Being wrapped in his arms was so pleasant that I didn't even protest when he pulled me in closer.
 My whole body tingled where it touched him, and his cologne, so faint as to be almost imperceptible, was like nothing I'd ever smelled.
 Almost against my will I found myself pressing up against him so I could drink in the scent.
 The music was still way too loud, everyone around us was still ridiculously drunk, but suddenly I couldn't care less.
 Someone tried to come up and talk to Brandon as the next song started, but he waved them off, not even pulling his eyes away from mine.
 I'd thought my heart couldn't race any faster than it already was, but when he started moving his face down closer to mine, it felt like it was going to tear itself free from my chest.
 It was happening.
 I'd fantasized about kissing even back when I thought boys had cooties.

“Please, move.

 Harruq was too stunned and disoriented to give him what he wanted.
 Instead he lied there, his nose throbbing and his swords limp in his hands.

 “The entire village of Cornrows is missing,” Dieredon said.

Several marked police cars hide in an adjacent apartment complex that has a driveway into the grocery store parking lot at the opposite end of the shopping center.
 I am instructed to park my truck’s front end against a fence that borders the parking lot facing the greenbelt.
 I am shown new surveillance photos of the two suspects and their vehicle: a red Dodge Charger with tinted windows.
 The code word which I am to use in a sentence to confirm the exchange of money for drugs has been changed to “Reno” and I see a pattern so I assume that if the deal does not go down this time, my next code word may be “Vegas.” I pray there isn’t a next time.
 Chapter 20: Going Down Finally a red Dodge Charger is driving slowly over the entrance bridge.
 I say, “Red Dodge Charger approaching at one o’clock,” attempting not to move my lips, as the vehicle is coming almost directly towards me on my right.
 The Dodge slows almost to a stop just a couple of car lengths away.
 I am unable to see in the tinted windows of the car but I am certain they can see me; I stare back as if to say, “Is that you?” They are obviously aware that I am there, alone and awaiting their arrival.
 The car slowly pulls away after taking a good look at me.
 I lose sight of them, as they seem to be going towards the opposite end of the parking lot.

 Art – I look forward to sharing what I know, or pretend to know.
 Do you want me to make it sound deep and inspired?
 Or do you prefer open and honest?

It's the only place within an hour and a half where you can do any decent shopping."
 Normally the prospect of driving for hours to watch someone else spend money I didn't have, sounded roughly as appealing as laying out naked at the pool until I had second-degree burns on my whole body.
 Then again, maybe burns wouldn't be so bad if they let me disappear into the anonymity of a large crowd in an actual city rather than dealing with hick hostility.
 "That sounds great; I can't wait to get out of this stupid town."
 A couple of people started a bit, and I heard a locker slam shut with surprising force.
 The eavesdroppers were predictably pissed I was dissing their home, but I didn't care.
 It served them right.

For this moment you are enough in the Celestial Realm for me to ask you a question: I don’t understand why you have chosen that.” As she spoke she raised her slim perfect arm and pointed at his shadow.
 He lowered his great head and studied the dark shape.
 The great lion had to admit the shadow was odd, slimmer than his great bulk, strangely dark in the day and the shadow’s eyes seem to glow the bright yellow color of flame.
 He shook his great head and mane as if to free it from the strange shadow, and growled, “You are a Goddess; you can see all.” Blodeuwedd nodded, she forgot to walk for a moment, as if in deep thought, but still she kept up with the Great Lion stalking through the grassland.
 “I can see all in our realm, and all in the mortal realm that is seen by one of our followers.
 I cannot see into the Infernal or Elemental Realms, and I think you have entered both.
 I do not know what this means.” The two continued through the grass for a few moments in silence.
 The Great Lion did not understand the Goddess’ questions or concerns.
 But he understood his own power, which in its way was as great as any god’s.

He reminded me of Evelyn, always so proud of herself for finding me out.
 The stranger watched me as I ate.
 When I devoured the first piece, he laughed and threw me another.
 I hoped I looked appropriately abashed.
 As I finished the second serving, he stepped closer to sit on the misshapen rock that rose through the earth beside me.
 He held his hand wide and a canteen flew up from a pile of things on the other side of the fire.
 He passed it to me, and I tilted it back, expecting cool water.
 I almost choked when warm wine hit my throat.

 Harruq nodded, again saying nothing.
 “Calm yourself,” Qurrah whispered to his brother as the two marched in front of the guards toward the main streets.
 “Trying,” Harruq whispered back.
 They marched at sword point.
 Onlookers cackled as they passed, figuring the two were thieves or vagrants caught brawling.
 Their orcish features lent them no kindness, and a few children even threw rocks until the guards shooed them away.

This resulted in a self-defeating downward commodity price spiral.
 The increased exports of these commodities pushed world prices lower, thereby forcing debtor nations to export ever larger quantities to earn the same amount of foreign exchange to repay debts.
 Defaults on these loans have resulted in huge losses by the world’s major banks and write-offs of billions of dollars by donor governments.
 One consequence has been to increase the attractiveness of drugs cultivation as an alternative source of income for farmers in developing countries.
 At the height of the drug wars, the then President of Colombia, Virgilio Barco, argued that farmers in his country would readily give up cocaine production if the international price of coffee could be stabilized at its former price level.
 His call unheeded, the United States has been forced to spend billions of dollars fighting drugs crimes and expanding prisons due to the rapid increase of drugs consumption in America.
 By a strange circuitous mechanism, the savings to consumers in developed nations by the refusal of their governments to negotiate international commodity agreements favour able to developing countries has cost these governments and their economies tens of billions of dollars in the form of loan write-offs and crime fighting.
 If an international commission in the 1970s had tried to point out this linkage between low agricultural incomes in Colombia and drug-related crime in New York, London or Moscow, it would have been readily dismissed.
 But this is the type of understanding and perspective needed by governments and international agencies today to formulate effective policy measures in an interdependent world.

 I walked through to check the back, but still found nothing.
 Junnie was exceedingly clean and organized, so I couldn’t tell if she’d even been home.
 I wandered back to the front door and was surprised by a tall figure there.
 The elaborate robe and tassels of a decorated council member blocked my way and the fear returned.
 “Elfreda.” I cautiously dipped my head in respect.
 “Juniper Fountain has received the calling.” I stared at him in disbelief, stuttering out a, “Wha—” But then I caught myself, because I had heard clear enough.

 He smirked and I couldn't hold back the urge to slap him.
 I slapped my hand across his face so hard it left a mark on his cheek.
 “Start talking,” I snarled.
 “Who are you guys and what are you doing?” The faery jerk smirked again.
 “We're part of Kojas' personal guard.
 We were sent to look for you half-lings.” “Well I want you to know something,” I said and got closer to his face.

 He shook his head when she speared a piece.

 Rick ate it slowly, closing his eyes.

Large thorns burst from the vines on my legs and pierced my skin like daggers.
 I barely had the capacity to hope they weren’t poison.

 Out of the corner of my eye I saw a flash of lightning and it confused me for a moment; no storm was near.
 A vine wrapped my shoulder, jerking me back.

 I looked to Ruby, but she could not help me now.

 I was only in the house for fifteen minutes before I realized being all by myself was a terrible idea.
 At some point I transitioned from just crying to having a full-blown panic attack.
 It should've terrified me that something new was bringing on an episode, but it was like there was so much else going wrong I couldn't spare any more emotional energy.

But before accepting the sigil he wanted to be sure that any Shadow Order he joined was mostly about secrecy to protect themselves, and that he would still be able to compete for true knighthood in the Order of the Soaring Heavens.
 Rodregas dropped into his cot tired and exhausted.
 Even with his healing sigil he had needed a full night’s rest, but duty did not wait for what a man needed.
 Imeralda woke him slightly after dawn, and Rodregas could tell that both she and Doi’van had spent the few hours left of the night working on what was left of their equipment.
 The tear in both his leather shirt and chain were sewn up, the first with thread the second with steel wire.
 For a mace, Doi’van had bought a piece of round solid steel from the smithy.
 It was a crude thing but of the proper size to qualify for the tournament.

The town is so small that the phonebook is about the size of a comic book.
 It was 1957 and she was impregnated by her boyfriend in the back seat of his parents’ car.
 My mother and father decided to sneak out to a neighboring town and get married after they discovered her pregnancy.
 After their wedding, they returned to their respective homes each night, keeping their secret.
 They did not know how or when they would break the news to their families.
 But they had overlooked a tell-tale sign of their nuptials: The event would be published under “wedding announcements” in that little town’s newspaper, just a few miles down a rural road.
 Their secret was revealed over the high school intercom when they were both summoned from their classes to the Principal’s office.
 The announcer, heard by all who attended this rural school in the center of Hoisington, Kansas, called my father’s name, Richard T. DeHaven, and then my mother’s newly acquired married name, Karla June DeHaven.
 It echoed through the classrooms, with a collective gasp from students and teachers.
 They were excused from class, walked through the desks that lined the classroom, all eyes following them out the door.

For a moment I couldn't focus on what Britney was saying, my heartbeat had become completely erratic from the surge of adrenaline flooding my body as it futilely tried to escape the nameless things that'd been snapping at my heels.
 "...out in the south end of Zions.
 It was Mark Childs and Lessi Arnolds.
 The bodies were a couple of days old by the time search and rescue found them, but it was pretty obvious they'd been mauled by something."
 I opened my mouth to interrupt, but my vocal chords weren't working.
 Now that she'd finally broached the subject, Britney was unstoppable.
 "It had to have been a mountain lion, there isn't anything else around here that's both aggressive and big enough to kill people, but neither of them had been gnawed on at all, which was strange enough by itself.
 Everyone refusing to talk about it would've been enough to make it X-Files weird, but when the coroner threw such a fit, it entered a class of its own."
 Britney looked around again to make sure nobody was in hearing range, and then leaned in even closer.
 "He said the wounds weren't made by anything in the cat family.

As the two brothers watched, he whispered a few words of magic, enlarging the chest to normal size.
 “Over the centuries, I have gathered many items to aid those who would swear their lives to me,” Velixar said.
 The locks clicked open, the lid raised, and then he reached inside and pulled out two swords sheathed in gleaming obsidian.
 “These swords were once wielded by Aerland Shen.
 He led the elves that aided Karak in the great war against Ashhur.
 When Celestia cursed his kind, they shared his curse.” Velixar smiled at Harruq, his eyes gleaming.
 “Long have I waited for someone to wield these blades.
 An elf crafted and used them in battle, an elf cursed into an orc.
 These swords can only be held by one who has the blood of both inside him.” Velixar held the hilts out to Harruq, who drew one from its sheath.

He was hoping to find some hidden wealth, stashed in the drawers.
 He ended up with a pile of clothes.
 Some were fancy, but none would be of much use on the road and none were worth selling.
 Next, Rodregas went to the wardrobe, which was engraved with the shape of trees and made of a sweet smelling wood.
 It was much more likely to hold something of value.
 He opened the doors to see brightly colored robes, and there on the left was a suit of chain mail.
 Rodregas could feel his smile.

3.Import liberalization: Drastic import liberalization led to the inflow of better-quality, lower-priced foreign goods that depressed demand for domestically produced goods.
 The shock impact of imports was aggravated by the fact that farmers in the region were forced to compete in some cases with subsidized agricultural products from the West.
 4.Privatization: Although the actual progress of privatization has been relatively slow in most instances, the uncertainty regarding the future status and ownership of enterprises and property has inhibited investment, slowed up current production, and led to widespread plunder of state property.
 5.Trade: As the socialist structure of these countries began to change and the political influence of the Soviet Union diminished, there was a huge drop in the trade between countries of the region, and, following the break-up of the USSR, between the republics of the Soviet Union as well.
 Not all countries in the region experienced all five shocks.
 Those that were spared proved better able to sustain output and real incomes.
 Czechoslovakia had not suffered from inflation and was largely free of external debt.
 Hungary, which had decentralized its economy and had introduced significant elements of the market in production and investment before 1989, was not subject to the sudden shocks due to import liberalization and termination of planning.
 Lessons from the Reform

For a second I thought Cassie would go through with it.
 Her knuckles went white, and her breathing sped up.

 When Brandon's hand appeared on Cassie's shoulder to restrain her, I thought for a second my knees would buckle.
 A few seconds later, it was as if nothing had ever happened.
 The ring of spectators dissolved as kids quickly returned to their tables.
 Brandon and his friends left through one set of cafeteria doors, while Alec and his friends departed through the other.

 We stayed there for some time, a fact for which I was grateful.
 Even though whatever had happened seemed to have passed, neither man seemed in a hurry to go.
 Chevelle glanced at me occasionally but kept himself busy around the fire.
 Steed still played with his feather, eventually entertaining me with it.
 It spun toward me and turned down, tickling my arm and then my nose.

 The cool spring breeze was weak compared to the ice that locked his spine.
 He held a torch in one hand and a shortsword in the other.
 At first, he had thought himself foolish waking in a full panic from a nightmare he could not remember.
 Then he saw others about, lit torches in their hands, and he knew his fear was justified.
 A young, fat-nosed farmer saw him awake and approached.

Some of the faces across the circle from me flinched a little, and I had a moment to wonder if Brandon hadn't told them the truth about what'd happened.
 "Her life belonged to me, it was mine to dispose of as I saw fit."
 I opened my mouth to protest, but closed it at a sharp jab in the ribs from Rachel.
 "The ancient laws don't support her life being a disposable commodity, extinguished at your whim.
 Not even the bond of Ja'tell provides you with that right."
 Brandon's grin was wider even than before.
 "Ah, but those aren't the laws under which we labor now, are they?
 She's mine, and I have every right to do whatever I wish to her.
 Her presence among your pack is a direct affront to my rights and honor.

During 1993, 42 countries were involved in 52 major conflicts, and another 37 experienced political violence.
 Terrorist warfare, whose principal aim is to threaten social peace, has become the model for conflicts in Northern Ireland, the Middle East and the drug war in Colombia.
 Modern means of communication, increased vulnerabilities of inter-dependent, integrated civil societies, and modern instruments of violence make these forms of war extremely destructive.
 The expansion of war to encompass society poses one of the most serious challenges to national and international security and development and raises fundamental questions regarding war as an instrument of policy.
 For more than two centuries, war has been rationalized as an appropriate instrument in international affairs.
 The increasing destructiveness of violent conflict to society in general has resulted in a shift in military strategy from actual fighting to preventive diplomacy.
 The Helsinki Process, the Stockholm Document, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Warsaw Treaty’s adoption of the doctrine of ‘non-offensive defence’, and most recently the UN Secretary General’s Agenda for Peace – all give highest priority to war prevention.
 While welcome, these incremental measures do not fully recognize either the extent of the danger of the continued application of violence to achieve political ends or the extent of the opportunity which the end of the Cold War has brought for radically altering the way in which humanity settles domestic and international disputes.
 There was a time when war could be justified as a necessary expedient.
 Now the potential human and economic costs of even limited terrorist war – especially if it involves the use of nuclear or biological weapons, but even otherwise – are so great that the risks are no longer tolerable.

 He’d decided he wanted to get this journey over with, end it and return me to the council for punishment, to be done with me.
 We rode long into the evening, well past sunset, and I began to wonder if he would stop at all.
 I was contemplating possible ways to sleep on a horse when he finally stopped.
 We were riding through a small pass, the moonlight barely lighting our way, and Chevelle’s horse disappeared.
 My head swiveled, searching for any sign of them, and then my own horse turned beneath an overhang and stopped in a cavern so dark I hadn’t seen it until we were there.
 Chevelle tossed out a small flame, giving us enough light to dismount.
 The horses walked to one end of the cavern, their hoofbeats echoing softly, as we remained in the other.

And how it would benefit him.
 I turned to him, glaring, and he drew back, startled.
 “Is that what you want, why you are so intent on marrying me?
 For my power?” He shook his head, mystified.
 The rage had overtaken me, though.
 The weeks of drugging Rune, sneaking out, my missing father—searching for a new wife, I was sure—all of it too much.

I did better than expected, but still not as well as I'd hoped.

The ability of such books to show the pattern of the spell means that even a mage who knows a spell by heart can cast it faster by using such a book.
 It also means that such books are much sought after and never given up freely.
 Grimoires are nearly never sold, unless the owner dies.” She paused to make sure they were both following her and then continued, “While the Grimoires are a great tool for quick and accurate casting of a spell, it is even more potentially useful for someone trying to learn magic.
 Reading a regular book with the spell written down and trying to keep all the symbols and shapes just right in your head even as you fill the complex shape with power requires years to learn.
 But a powerful Grimoire can quickly show you the shape and help you learn new spells in weeks, instead of years.
 “Also, sorcerers, like all people, learn in different ways.
 Some can quickly grasp a written idea where others will struggle to learn from a book.
 Or, a magician who is also a gifted musician will understand the flow and pace of the spell much better, like a piece of music.
 The most powerful Grimoires have had multiple users who are very different in their learning styles.
 Books like these will allow you not to just learn the spells the best way for you, but in a much deeper, complex way.

On one final occasion, my parents were having a large party at the house.
 I was sitting at a desk in my room doing some schoolwork and I could hear the guests’ loud voices in the hallway beyond my door.
 Suddenly my door burst open and slammed against the wall.
 It was Dino, and he commanded me to stand up.
 I could see some party guests in the hallway behind him.
 The sound of the door and his voice had them looking at me from around his large frame.
 Their conversations stopped as their attention was drawn to the commotion.
 I stood and Dino directed me to approach him.
 He was obviously drunk and I could see the usual crazed look in his eyes.
 He started rambling something about how I didn’t like him or respect him and I quickly claimed I did.

At semester's end, she returned to the first Greek and, with his arguments, refuted a modern German.
 Philosophers argue and presume the best argument wins.
 But what if an idea we can't argue moves us so deeply we have to at least consider that it might be true though we could never argue why?
 The question prompted me to changed my major from philosophy to literature.
 Had I been less arrogant, I might've turned to theology instead, and perhaps become truly wise.
 I’m fairly bright, but slow.
 When a new idea arises, I only ponder until my brain begins to hurt.
 Then I let the idea go until the next time it surfaces.
 For months, on and off, ever since the song alerted me, I have pondered the idea of Eric as more than a sensitive fellow with clairvoyant powers and a tremendous heart who chose to protect Bill Torrey and me.

So like Doi’van, always thinking, Rodregas thought with a smile.
 “So first I make my infernal side more structured and then I become a part Nymph, a strange combination for a Hellborn.” Rodregas said, “I think we both feel the importance of the blessing and I thank you for sharing it.” She nodded and said, “I am so happy that I decided to go with you to sneak in, otherwise I would never have been able to receive the blessing of the One Tree.
 No matter how successful we are now against the Immortalists, I have been blessed as few of my people have.” Imeralda looked like she wanted to talk and Rodregas hated to break the mood, but they needed to get back to business.
 “We should return to the main chamber.
 The Grand Marshal will be coming soon for the official moment for me to take on a greater sigil, and I don’t think we want them to find these chambers.” As Rodregas walked from the chamber of the One Tree he felt more regret than when he had left the Infernal chamber; though in all likelihood the sigil from the Night Panther would prove to be of more use on his quest.
 The three walked as one to the Celestial Lion.
 They looked first at the great beast and then at Rodregas.
 “Are you sure I have the magical strength to take on two greater sigils?” he asked Imeralda.
 “Few have such strength; taking a second greater sigil seems to consume far more power than one.
 It is not just twice as much, but far more.

Alec is a remarkable fighter, to hear Donovan speak of it, he's possibly even almost the equal of his father, but Brandon's strength and speed have not seen a match in centuries.
 It's likely Brandon will emerge the victor."
 Even though, or possibly exactly because it was what I'd suspected, the words sent slivers of ice through me.
 My heart seemed to be having a hard time maintaining a steady rhythm, but I forced myself not to give into the panic attack that was promising temporary relief from the horror of my life.
 With what I'd just been told, I should be able to put some of the pieces together.
 "Once Alec is dead, there'll be repercussions for everyone else?"
 Again the short, reluctant nod.
 I had so many questions I still wanted answered, but it didn't seem fair to get Isaac in any more trouble than he was already in.

It was a lot for someone our age to deal with.
 "There's an uncommon amount of that going around right now."
 Alec shook his head at my curious stare.
 "Dom and Jasmin both seem to be spending more time in bed than you'd expect based on the wounds they took putting down Cassie and the others.
 Isaac moved like an old man when we spared yesterday and Donovan is looking old lately."
 I thought back and realized he was right, about Donovan at least.
 The old shape shifter always moved gingerly thanks to old injuries that had left his right leg permanently crippled.
 I hadn't thought anything of it at the time but Donovan was looking frailer lately.
 The thought of Donovan getting to the point that his age was starting to show nearly made me choke up.
 I didn't have the extensive history with Donovan that Alec's family had, but he'd been unfailingly kind to me despite the fact that I'd endangered everything he cared about.

 He explained, “It’s too late now.

 “Yes,” I answered boldly, the word echoing with the thrum of my pulse.

Rodregas had helped drag her beyond the gates.
 She lay there not moving, limp though alive; she was dead in every way that mattered.
 Rodregas went back into the keep without looking back; he never knew what had happened to her after that.
 After dreaming every night about killing him, Rodregas now had Korin in his grip.
 It was time to end Korin’s vile pestilence on the world.
 Rodregas got behind him with his right hand covering his mouth, and with his left took a firm grip on the top of his head.
 Rodregas leaned over to his ear and whispered “You probably don’t remember, but you killed a boy named Jorin by snapping his neck, and payback is a bitch.” Snapping a grown man’s neck is quite hard.
 Rodregas had never done it; he had learned that there were better ways to kill a man than trying to break his spine with bare hands.
 But with the memory of Korin breaking Jorin’s neck, adrenaline pounded in his new arms.
 This was justice long overdue.

The whole keep could hear the wild rutting going on.
 Ravenhurr then had goats released on the roof and the Celestial Lion had gorged himself on them when he had finished rutting.
 The well-satisfied beast lay limp, sleeping, confident in his celestial power, and oblivious to his surroundings.
 He lied unbound, as required by the ceremony.
 Rodregas assumed some subtle magic had been used to influence the beast to sleep in just the right spot.
 The unlikely success of having an actual celestial animal as part of the ceremony had put Ravenhurr into an unusually good mood.
 Using one of the Dire Cats in the ceremony would have been good, but an actual Celestial animal would provide much more power.
 Rodregas’ hands clutched into a fist at his side as he could not help thinking that the last thing the world needed was for Ravenhurr, or any of the Immortalists, to acquire more power.
 Rodregas knew there was almost no opposition to the Immortalist left, but futile as it would probably be Rodregas could no longer go along with their immoral acts.

Funding for the strategy would come from a mix of public sector and private sector investment.
 The funding requirements are within the range of current five-year projections: 84 per cent of additional planned investment in agriculture and 25 per cent of additional planned expenditure in industry.
 The average cost per additional job is less than $1,000, roughly one-tenth the average cost of jobs in India's private sector and one-hundredth the cost of new jobs in the public sector.
 Implementation of the strategy will require a substantial investment in training of both on-farm and industrial workers, but the plan is based on the recognition that enhancing the skills of the nation's rural work-force will take time and must be done incrementally.
 As the programme gains momentum and rural incomes rise, the demand for industrial products and services will grow, resulting in a shift to greater farm mechanization and gradual movement of more and more workers to non-farm employment.
 Organization is a crucial issue in a country of more than 90 million small farmers.
 The strategy envisions the establishment of several new types of organization to bring together small farmers for processing, marketing and distribution and to promote more active linkages between farmers and the private industrial sector, both Indian and foreign.
 In order to implement such a massive strategy within a ten-year period, government must play a central role as catalyst and pioneer, rather than owner or manager, to generate widespread public awareness about the technological and commercial opportunities, identify optimal and sustainable resource-based potentials for specific regions, facilitate the transfer and dissemination of technology, provide training and demonstration, invest in the techno-infrastructure needed for transport, storage and distribution, offer management education to rural enterprises, and promote the establishment of new organizations.
 The Prosperity 2000 strategy has been adopted by the Indian government and incorporated in India's Eighth Five Year Plan.
 A Small Farmer's Agri-Business Consortium, a specialized agency for implementation of the strategy, has been established by the government to coordinate implementation.

tegy provides the infrastructure needed to implement the strategy. Review new implementation decisions taken by leading government agencies will be ongoing. Implementation measures would include the development of a population productivity index92m,0m support for investment in institutions no longer attached to the establishment of "national entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs92m enjoying0m their full92m potential0m in the field of agriculture and entrepreneurship", and publication of new92m working0m papers.

The sword sat in my newly acquired sheath and I drew it out, taking a peculiar sort of delight in the ssshk that sounded when the steel passed through.
 The others watched me, silent and wary, but the tracker smirked.
 He wasn’t afraid of a sword.
 The last tracker hadn’t given at broken bones, not even before the threat of certain death.
 I’d need something dreadful, a new tactic to convince him.
 A tiny snake sunning on a nearby rock caught my eye and I smiled.
 Some part of me knew what had happened before, had felt it.
 I could do it again.
 I slipped the tip of the sword down to the tracker’s leg, just above where his knee met the ground, and sliced his trousers up to the thigh to reveal bare skin.

Almost before I knew it, I was downstairs and once again facing the dreaded decision of whether or not to eat breakfast.
 I already knew I wasn't hungry; the only real decision was how much of Mom's wrath I was willing to face later on.
 It wasn't until I had my hand on the doorknob that I remembered Brandon's promise to pick me up.
 I was so tired I actually considered for a second that he might have been serious.
 Sitting in his car, fighting not to look at his smiling gray eyes, it'd all seemed so reasonable.
 I'd lost my ride and he was grateful I'd saved him from having to interfere with Cassie, so he was going to become my personal chauffeur for the rest of the year.
 Looking at my empty lane, the school bus only minutes away, it seemed more likely Brandon wouldn't even remember talking to me.
 Just like every hot boy with every loser since the dawn of time.

Shift to Services: One would hardly expect to find the decline of manufacturing jobs as a source of employment opportunities, but historical data supports this conclusion.
 Fear over the destruction of manufacturing jobs due to adoption of capital intensive technology has been prevalent for the past 100 years.
 Every new technology that automates a process or increases worker productivity has been perceived as a threat to the future of work.
 The reality has proved to be quite different.
 Technological development propels a spiral of economic development that creates many more jobs than it destroys.
 The most striking testimony to this fact is the history of employment in USA, arguably the country that has most readily and fully adopted new technologies over the past century.
 Employment in manufacturing and mining grew to a peak of about 40 per cent of the workforce after World War II before beginning its downward spiral to 15 per cent by 2000, about the same proportion as in 1850.
 Yet, during this same period total employment in America has expanded phenomenally, from a mere 13 million workers in 1870 to 68 million in 1955 and more than 136 million in 2002.
 In spite of all the automation and all the export of jobs to lower wage economies, the percentage of the American population employed has continued to rise over time.
 Several factors are responsible for this result, among which population growth and technological development are most prominent.

"We're all done.
 Wait until the end of your normal shift, and then go home.
 If anyone complains feel free to suggest that they don't leave it until the last minute next time."
 There was plenty of grumbling when I announced that the lab was over, but nobody actually said anything.
 Rachel was waiting for me at the door as everyone else filed out.
 She looked up guiltily as I made my way over to her.
 "Did you have a good day?
 I haven't seen that many people here ever."
 If there was one thing that'd always pissed me off, it was people who refused to own up to their mistakes.
 In my mind not being where you said you were going to be, especially after being so jazzed about it previously, fit into that category.

His insides churned as icy fingers pressed against his forehead.
 Images crackled through his mind.
 The entire world burned to ash and blew away on the wind.
 The painting revealed beneath was in fluid motion, an artwork of death and fire.
 He saw a city burning, people fleeing in the streets, and then he saw himself dressed in black armor that oozed power.
 Salvation and Condemnation waved high above his head, both drenched in blood.
 He looked like a god among men, and the way the soldiers fell at his feet made him think he might have been one.
 This red-dream self looked straight at him and spoke, but Harruq could not understand the words.
 The sound of his own voice chilled him, though, for it was dark, it was dangerous, and it was exactly like Velixar’s.

“What sort of trouble?” “Apparently, Evelyn of Rothegarr came into town from the meadows at full speed wheezing and sneezing.
 She reached the village center, grabbed her throat, and fell to the ground without a breath.

 Fannie continued, “They found a common thistle caught in her airway.” My stomach curled into knots.
 I whispered, “A thistle?” “Mmm.

 After a year, Pam returned to school.
 Two schools--Bethel Seminary for yet another Masters degree and U.C.
 Riverside for a PhD in Comparative Literature.
 And at those schools, when she met a new crowd of young folks just launching out toward their dreams, she wondered how much she had given up by marrying a fellow who already thought about retiring, which caused me to wonder in turn if I should I steel myself to prepare for another breakup?
 And should I make sure that if it came I wouldn’t again have to slog through the morass of missing my kid.
 Pam continued vacillating.

She was so gorgeous.
 He watched as she rubbed lotion on her lovely legs, her silky dark hair falling forward as she did so.
 Marie, not noticing any difference in his stare, smiled as she handed him the bottle.
 "Will you put some on my back?"
 She stretched out on her stomach.
 He ran his hands up and down and around her back, massaging and caressing.

I would call the target soon and instruct her to meet me in a particular spot.
 Things moved rapidly now and the instructions came quickly.
 I was instructed to get as much incriminating conversation as I could, including the price, quantity and name of the drug; anything beyond that would be helpful but gravy.
 The main thing was to get the money for the drugs.
 Then I was shown the contents of a small white plastic bottle: One hundred Oxys poured into the officer’s hand.
 They were smaller than I thought they would be and an odd green color.
 He gathered the pills back into the bottle and handed them to me, telling me to put them in an easily accessible jacket pocket.
 The officers were all gathered around, but my focus was now entirely on the lead man, Officer White, the same undercover officer who had busted my son, had screwed up by giving Brandon the wrong phone number and with whom I had negotiated this deal.
 He was cocky and his ego always front and center, but I completely understood this demeanor.

Rodregas simply kept running in a circle around Geriodon just outside the range of his mace.
 He dug into the sand with his feet and he ran, and kept running.
 Minutes went by before Geriodon’s own spin move went a little too fast as he tired.
 Then Rodregas simply threw himself into the man and wrestled him to the ground.
 Even as Rodregas carefully ripped Geriodon’s helmet off the squire kept fighting.
 This man was a true fighter and Rodregas wished that he could also become a knight, but there could be only one winner today.
 Rodregas’ fist stopped the squire’s struggles.
 He looked around and to his alarm he saw the last remaining squire running toward the hall with the shield.
 It was generally understood that you did not try to claim the shield until the last opponent was down.
 But, of course, the winner was simply the first to take the shield to the hall.

This was not really his body that she wanted to touch; he was not really this young handsome man that she felt attracted to.
 He wanted to pull away, but did not let himself.
 He had initiated the intimacy, and it would not be fair of him to pull away because of his personal doubts.
 “Easy,” Rodregas said, “I want to go nice and slow and enjoy every step.” They kissed again, this time eagerly exploring each other’s mouth and lips.
 He ran his lips down the line of her chin.
 Though he was trying to go slowly, they quickly found themselves naked.
 He thought if he had let her, she would have jumped right on him and slid himself inside her.
 Rodregas knew that Nymphs were legendary for their enjoyment of sex, but he was a little surprised at her eagerness.
 She ran her hands and lips across his chest, seemingly fascinated by ‘his’ powerful musculature and smooth skin.

 “Did his tongue die with him?” Harruq asked.

 “You take my life, and now you dare keep me from eternity?” the spirit moaned.
 “For what reason do you torment me?

 I was hit with blurry images first, sights and scenes that melded into hazy dreams.
 Eventually they became clearer, though they didn’t make much sense.
 After a time it occurred to me the problem was the images were mixing with the wrong sounds… real sounds.
 Panicked sounds.
 I thought I recognized Chevelle’s voice and tried to focus on it, to understand the agony.
 “Frey,” he said, and something brushed my cheek, warm and feather light.
 The distant impression that it might have been the brush of lips had me drawing in a sharp breath, and I coughed, gasping to fill my lungs.

Those who wield national power must come to realize that force of compulsion will not bring about a permanent reconciliation and amelioration of relationships in human affairs.
 Superior power must bring with it a superior sense of fairness and a commitment to constructive dialogue and action to attack the root causes of terrorism.
 It must shed its own accretion of mental insincerity cloaked as diplomacy.
 Then and then only these movements of violence will shrink and finally disappear.
 The period following September 11th, as US National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice put it, is one “not just of grave danger, but of enormous opportunity.”
 Resolving Local Conflicts: The Commission concluded that the end of the Cold War made it possible to successfully resolve problems that had resisted solution for decades, such as the many violent communal and ethnic conflicts occurring in the world.
 The near total cessation of violence in North Ireland during the past 10 years is proof that rapid progress can be made on issues involving apparently intractable communal sentiments.
 This achievement appears astounding to those who lived through the earlier decades of religious violence and until recently found it nearly impossible to imagine a mitigation of the conflict in the foreseeable future.
 We would do well to examine closely this instance to draw lessons that may aid in addressing those conflicts that continue to defy resolution.
 The most striking lesson of the Irish experience is that rapid development absorbs and dissipates the urge for violence.

Both depend for their success on the quality of those choices, which means on the quality of education and information possessed by the mass of people, and on the freedom and dynamism of the population.
 In contrast, authoritarian systems and command economies centralize decision making, restrict the flow of information to the public, foster vast unresponsive bureaucracies, limit individual freedom and initiative within narrow bounds, and encourage obedience and conformity rather than innovation.
 The spread of education, which fosters independent thinking, and dissemination of information through the media were important factors in undermining public acceptance of communism in Eastern Europe.
 In a real sense, it was Gorbachev’s policy of glasnost that brought down the Iron Curtain.
 It opened up an insular society and exposed it to an avalanche of new information, new ideas and new possibilities, which released a fervent aspiration in the people for a better life.
 Over the last few years, democratization has been especially dynamic in Africa, where it has been dubbed Africa’s Second Liberation.
 During the first three decades of post-colonial independence, almost all of the continent’s 54 states had come under either single-party or military rule.
 The preference for authoritarian rule was often justified by the need for rapid economic development, which could be impeded by opposition to government policies and by the need to contain regional and tribal conflicts.
 Neither of these claims has proven true.
 Living standards have actually declined in most African countries during the last two decades.

 CM:  	So, between Turntable Poison and your California period, lies a great gulf that not a whole lot of people know about.

Jim & Liz - Really drunk.
 Liz – Sorry, I just blurted that out, didn’t think first.
 Jim – Can your mom even drink that much, without passing out soon after anyway?
 Liz – Maybe, she boasts that she could out drink an entire company of Marines.
 But I think she would have to cheat to do it.
 Jim – An entire company?
 How do you cheat to in a drinking contest?
 Liz – If I told you that, then what edge would I have if we ever had a drinking contest?

I sat on the cold stone floor, shivering.
 I was soaked to the skin and my hair was completely plastered to my head.
 Seth sat next to me and I could see he was shivering too.
 Jason slid down the wall across from us with his eyes closed.
 “I never want to walk again,” he mumbled.
 “Never.” “You're going to have to, dude.
 We have a lot of walking left to do,” Seth said wearily.
 Jason groaned and circled up against the wall.
 Emily pulled her hood off and examined herself.
 She mumbled something and squeezed her sleeves.

What could it hurt, really?
 Sure, I could marry him, but it wouldn’t be real, I knew that.
 But the other part, well, I could do that without the marriage, couldn’t I?
 Harmless fun… I smiled as I leaned closer to him.
 This was the first time I had initiated a kiss and he was grateful—more than grateful… overwhelmed with pleasure.
 I laughed to myself at what was to come, if this small, insignificant gesture brought him so much happiness.
 Our lips touched and he gasped, and then the breath turned to a low moan.
 I rubbed the back of my hand over a cheek, trying to clear away the blush of color.
 The encounter was very… descriptive.
 I threw a wary glance over my shoulder, making sure Ruby was still at the window as I continued.

Alec was plenty prickly and stuck up, but that was nothing compared to how much the average student hated Vincent, who seemed to delight in making everyone's life miserable.
 The teachers seemed curiously ignorant of everything.
 Nobody else seemed to think that was unusual, which freaked me out almost as much as Ben having nearly gone over the stairs.
 At least I didn't have to listen to all of the gossip during lunch.
 Once I'd been able to hobble down the stairs, I'd made my way to Mr. Whethers' room, and I'd spent the entire lunch break studying.
 I hadn't been especially excited at the prospect of spending that long by myself, but the cafeteria was all the way on the other side of the school.
 Limping over there listening to Vincent run his mouth and then coming all the way back here for History wouldn't be worth it.
 History being what it was, I probably heard about as much in that one hour as most everyone else did during the whole rest of the day.
 Mr. Simms seemed especially dense, and pretty much let everyone do whatever they wanted for the entire class.

“Got to be a disguise,” he said.
 Another guard used the hilt of his sword to strike Harruq’s back.
 The blow blasted the air out of his lungs.
 The leader of the guards tugged all along Harruq’s face, pulling hair and scratching skin.
 “I’ll be,” he said.
 “It is real.
 No illusion and no disguise.
 You two cretins have god-damned elf blood in you.”
 “You jest,” Qurrah said, hanging back and showing no sign of aggression.
 The soldiers clearly thought Harruq the more dangerous of the two, and he was more than willing to let them continue thinking that.

I was still trying to decide whether or not to head back into the cafeteria, when the first bell rang, signaling a fitting end to a disappointment-filled lunch.
 History wasn't any better, and we had a sub for Physics.
 Alec actually walked into class, saw Mrs. Alexander wasn't there, and then turned around and left.
 It was possibly the most brazen act of class cutting I'd ever seen, and somehow it didn't surprise me in the least.
 Even so, I spent the rest of the hour stewing while working on the pointless, busywork assignment the sub handed out.
 Mrs. Tiggs still hadn't finished grading our tests, which meant I still had no idea how I'd done.
 By the time I finally half-collapsed at my normal table in the tutor lab, all I could think about was how nice it would be to see Brandon one more time as he drove me home.
 I looked around to verify that all of the usual suspects were there.
 Geeks, check.

I fought to stay focused on his face, so close.
 His eyes grew troubled and then he blurred out of vision as I went limp in his arms.
 “Frey…” I opened my eyes to the darkening sky.
 “What happened?” “You seem to have blacked out,” Chevelle said, a hint of some emotion under his reassurance.
 I blushed.
 He must have seen that coming, held me because of it, simply to prevent me from falling on my face.
 I was a fool.
 He helped me up, this time holding me only by one arm.
 I took a deep breath.
 “I’m okay now, I think.” His lips twisted again, but I couldn’t make out the expression.

I nodded, twisting my knee as I heard a bump in the carpet near my92m back0mside. Chevelle pushed my legs around as he frantically reached for my’ right92m hand0m.

He was still speechless.
 “Well, shall you stay, then?” “Forever,” he gushed.
 It was a curious response but I had begun to think he wasn’t that different, aside from the obvious lack of magic, skill, and grace.
 Moreover, where many of the others lacked beauty, he did not.
 Unconventional, yes, but nonetheless… interesting.
 I led him to a set of stones to sit, wanting to get answers to all the questions that had been burning in my mind since I had spotted them.
 He had forgotten his prey, so I offered to help him with it.
 This befuddled him, so I simply skinned and spitted the animal while he sat, staring in amazement.
 It was like he’d never seen fire before.
 It made the magic fun again.

“We’re freaking falling right now!” Emily looked at us and she tried to hide the fear in her face.
 “The dragon is going to pull its wings around us to protect us from falling but it’s going to make us fall faster.
 Make sure you hold on to something or get in the center.” Seth pressed himself against me and we leaned closer to the dragon’s back.
 Jason tucked his arms under him and Emily pressed next to him.
 Then, as if on cue, the dragon tucked its great wings over us, blocking out the sky and we began to really fall.
 I screamed louder and sunk deeper into Seth, trying to forget that we were falling at about 90 miles per hour without a parachute.
 Every second felt like an hour.
 I squeezed my eyes in an effort to make it all go away.
 Make it stop, make it stop… Seth gave me a comforting squeeze but it didn’t help.

 3.UN development force for food deficit regions.
 The complex task of planning, managing and executing nationwide programmes to eradicate food shortages may be beyond the political, administrative and management capacities of some governments, hampered by the absence of training and experience, political instability or social strife.
 The slowest member country retards the progress of the whole world.
 The interests of global peace, political stability and basic human rights justify and may necessitate external assistance to help countries establish viable food security systems.
 In countries that are unable either to produce sufficient food or to initiate coordinated programmes to overcome present deficits, the international development force proposed earlier in this report can act in a trusteeship role to assist in designing and implementing integrated programmes to upgrade food production and distribution.
 UNDP can undertake the role of coordinating the activities of all UN agencies in this effort.
 Emphasis should be placed on sustainable production and distribution – not just relief operations – through the introduction of effective systems for planning, administration, education, demonstration and implementation.
 4.Model districts.
 The potential benefits of applying a resource-based, location-specific approach to agriculture can best be demonstrated by the establishment of model programmes in different agro-climatic regions.

f direct experiences of food rights should have extensive impact on the perception of healthy food92m practices0m in a particular commodity zone and apply92m to0m model programmes in different regions.

There was a time when war could be justified as a necessary expedient.
 Now the potential human and economic costs of even limited terrorist war – especially if it involves the use of nuclear or biological weapons, but even otherwise – are so great that the risks are no longer tolerable.
 Because the potential risks far outweigh the possible advantages of continued reliance on this means of achieving national and international security, war has become obsolete as an instrument of policy.
 At the same time, there is no longer an insurmountable political conflict within the UN system to prevent all member countries from agreeing to a total ban on the use of violence against each other.
 It is time for the UN to declare war itself a crime against humanity and to ban from membership any nation that engages in aggression against another.
 Even if this intention cannot immediately be made effective, the adoption of this Peace Imperative would mark a milestone in human affairs.
 There is no rational or practical obstacle to the immediate adoption of this measure.
 As a starting point, it can be demonstrated that with the right perspective, courage and commitment, practical immediate solutions are possible for any and all of the conflicts presently raging.
 Recent failures of international diplomacy do not contradict this assertion, they confirm it.
 War must, and can, be abolished.

There was a story there, but I wasn't about to ask now and expose myself to further ridicule.
 Britney was oddly quiet as we entered the lunch room.
 I was a little hungry, but the pangs were a distant kind of discomfort.
 The real suffering for not eating wouldn't come into play until we hit the tutoring lab.
 Oh well, when I got home ravenous and ate a decent-sized meal Mom would probably be ecstatic.
 Or too wrapped up in some project to even notice.
 It was hard enough anticipating what I was going to do from day to day.
 Trying to figure Mom out was truly futile.
 Being held up by Mrs. Campbell at least had one advantage; the line for Britney to get food was nearly non-existent.

I smiled thinking of it.
 He took that as an invitation, leaning closer, his hand raised to touch my face.
 His thumb caressed the line of my jaw as he reached around, fingers tangling in my braids as he drew me to him.

 At some point, I became aware of what I was doing.
 I drew back.

He tackled me.
 I fell and my head whacked the concrete floor.
 The next I knew, several guys were pounding various parts of me.
 I couldn’t seem to move from the waist up.
 Maybe one or more of them held me down.
 But I threw a few kicks.
 Either they accomplished my intention or Tony or someone pulled the Polish guy off me.
 Then the others followed.
 I heaved myself up and made for the door.

“You are a powerful sorceress,” Velixar said, his anger gone as quickly as it had arrived.
 “But I have fought the founders of the Council of Mages.
 I have killed men who thought themselves gods.
 I have died but once, to Ashhur himself.
 There is no shame in your defeat.”
 Aurelia struggled to her feet.
 The well of magic inside her was dry.
 In time, her strength would return, but she doubted the necromancer would give her a day to rest.
 She used a bit of the magic she did have left to summon her staff.

“Captain Intreg, do you mind asking a few questions to confirm his status?” The Knight seemed uncomfortable under the hand of the sorcerer but nodded and said to Rodregas, “What is the eighth law of Chivalry?” “Thou shalt never offer combat to someone who is not equal in strength, unless in defense of the honor of the Order, for Justice for the oppressed or in defense of the weak,” he answered.
 Captain Intreg nodded and then asked, “A question of law: two messenger couriers stop at a keep with priority messages and switch out horses.
 The local lord finds that both horses are lame and are no longer any good.
 One of the messengers is from a neighboring lord and one from the Guild of the Celestial Path.
 What rights does the lord have in this situation?” Rodregas noticed the sorcerer seemed to stiffen at the question.
 Rodregas’ mind swirled.
 The first questions had been easy, but it had been a very long time since he had studied law.
 The sorcerer’s body language, though, directed his memory to the answer.
 Rodregas said, “The local lord is responsible for replacing the other lord messenger’s lame horse.
 There is nothing to be done for the Immortalist messenger’s horse.

However, a number of strategies are relevant to the majority of developing countries.
 Some of the components of an Action Plan designed to achieve this goal are given below.
 1.Elimination of agricultural trade barriers by industrial nations.
 The agreements reached for liberalizing agricultural trade in the Uruguay Round of GATT are an important step forward, but they will not release the full dynamism of the agricultural sector, which is so critical for more rapid growth of incomes and employment in both developing and developed countries.
 In the previous chapter, we have called for rapid reduction leading to a complete elimination of agricultural subsidies and other trade barriers by industrial nations, which can generate a positive multiplier effect.
 It has been estimated that complete liberalization of trade in agricultural commodities would yield an annual gain (in 1992 dollars) of about $25 billion for OECD countries and $22 billion for developing and formerly centrally planned countries.
 Actual gains could be very much higher.
 These subsidies cost Western consumers several hundred billion dollars annually.
 In addition, they lead to dumping of surplus sugar, cereal, milk and beef in developing countries, often pushing down the prices which farmers in these countries receive for their produce to far below their production cost.
 The benefits of eliminating these subsidies would be multiple.

 I mentally reached around for something similar and then finally nodded.
 "I guess I can understand that.
 My mom would have a hard time functioning without me, so I try to do the best I can at taking care of her."
 Rachel's smile lit the room up.

While the chatter of several witnesses turned it all into gibberish, and the gatekeeper shouted, “They’ve been drinking,” Kenny stood still, staring at his bloody fist as though wondering how it happened.
 Out of the crowd, a coach came striding.
 He shoved me aside and tried to grab Kenny.
 Kenny bolted, splitting the crowd.
 Down the steps and across the quad, his legs churned faster than the eye could register, like a propeller.
 The previous fall he had broken our school record for the 50-yard dash.
 The coach and a few ROTC kids gave chase.
 They all disappeared into a stand of eucalyptus.

Everyone got to dress up and go dancing in a place that'd been transformed into another world.
 Even before I'd gotten old enough to attend Prom, I'd still invariably spent the day grouchy and depressed.
 Things only got worse as I'd aged, presumably because I wasn't really as indifferent as I liked to pretend, and I couldn't hide behind the excuse of being too young to be asked anymore.
 My pulse had already skyrocketed; I almost didn't hear what Rachel was saying over the pounding in my ears.
 "...of course it's still a little ways away, but a girl like Britney starts early so she gets as high up the social food chain as possible."
 Rachel's words calmed me a little at the same time they sparked confusion.
 I'd never heard her be quite so cynical.
 It was completely at odds with the innocent, accepting exterior she usually displayed.
 My surprise must have leaked through.
 Almost as soon the thought crossed my mind Rachel's demeanor crossed back from the older, jaded visage, to one that was more youthful, even embarrassed.

What are they saying?
 Ruby remained protectively in front of me, her posture lowered, arms tensed tighter since the stranger turned his eyes on me.
 His face twisted in agony as his right arm was dislocated from its socket, leaving the limb hanging limply at the shoulder.
 I was glad I didn’t hear that sound.
 He turned back to his questioner, his mouth a grimace as the words came out, unmistakably a curse, and his other arm was wrenched from its place as well.
 He winced, apparently not yet numb from the damages, and then his face went hard, his lips pressed together, jaw clenched tight.
 He wasn’t going to scream.
 Or talk.
 His back twisted and he fell, a motionless heap on the ground.
 His body was bent out of recognition.

Can’t we just destroy the camp?” I went for my bow instead.
 “No,” she said a little more clearly.
 “We have to wait and see what happens.
 Plus, we can’t just randomly attack them.” I didn’t really care.
 The song was repeating itself in my head, like a taunt.
 Without thinking, I aimed and shot the nearest dwarf.
 As soon as he went down, the whole camp was facing our direction.
 I was standing up now where everyone could see me.
 There was no point in hiding anymore.
 Emily stayed hidden behind the tree, and I could feel her glare trying to burn me into ashes.

He'd greeted me with his typical, heart-stopping smile and I'd leaned in to kiss him before I'd even realized I was in motion.
 He'd pulled back, but his expression at least wasn't reproachful.
 I wanted to force the issue, wanted it so badly I could feel the desire bubbling inside me, but even more than my natural shyness, the thought of him pulling away again, this time in disgust, was too much to contemplate.
 Once we got to school, I'd found the rampant gossip had subsided to a dull rumble, but the few undecided votes had come down solidly on the side of everyone else.
 Some people hated me for using Brandon, others hated me for playing Alec, while a small, but decidedly upwardly-mobile group disliked me for achieving not just one, but both of the conquests they'd been dreaming of since grade school.
 In the end, it didn't really matter why everyone disliked me.
 Still, only the fact that Alec's pack closed ranks around me kept the situation from becoming unbearable.
 Biology went better than it had since my first day in Sanctuary, largely because Alec seemed to have developed a postdoctorate knowledge of Biology.
 Also he didn't have a single qualm when it came to using that knowledge to deflect questions aimed at me.
 Mrs. Sorenson tried three different times to make me look stupid before finally giving up and getting down to the business of teaching.

“First, Geriodon is much disliked.
 He is gruff, unfriendly and too serious to like.
 The squires and knights universally dislike him.
 This is his third attempt to achieve knighthood and he has gotten closer each time.
 While he is the odds on favorite to achieve it this year, no one wants him to win,” she said.
 “I went and chatted with him,” she continued “and he hates the Immortalists, but is rather unpleasant and needs to take a bath.
 But he is also clearly very honorable.
 And when I asked him why he wanted to be a knight…” she paused then added, “he said that some ‘Infernally damned knights’ have to stand up and fight.” “So you think he is a good man?” Rodregas asked.
 “I think Geriodon is a ‘holier than thou’ stick in the mud, who needs to learn to bathe and not mumble when he speaks.
 And yes, he is probably one of the only men here that actually deserves knighthood.” Rodregas nodded and said, “What about Nordien?” “Nordien is the polar opposite to Geriodon; smooth and friendly… and tried to have sex with me within our first conversation, which was also the only decent thing he said during our conversation.

 She blushed just thinking about how they made her feel.

Finally the crew is all present behind the store, and the review of protocol and procedure began as it did before.
 New officers are in amongst familiar faces from the prior attempt.
 I find myself less interested in their chat as I mentally prepare myself for the task at hand.
 I am given the weapons and shots fired instructions again.
 In my usual humorous deflection of discomfort, I quip that the last time I met Ashley it was a “happy ending” and I would like the same result this time.
 The officers are un-amused.
 The officers are sent to stake out a nearby drugstore.
 My story to the drug dealers will be that I will fill the prescription there and meet her in that parking lot as it is a stone’s throw within the county line which they want the bust in.
 One problem I point out is that the drugstore will be closed in a few minutes but they send the crew that direction for feedback on the location.

I glanced down the mountainside.
 I couldn’t have found my way back if I’d wanted to.
 I had no idea where I was.
 I stared at my palms, some spell-bought map carved into my skin, and was hit full force with the knowledge that I didn’t even know where I was going.
 I was about as low on options as I could get.
 If not for Chevelle’s desire to skip out on Council business for a few days, or whatever we were doing here, I’d already be imprisoned.
 I could hope that with the dreams, with the mountains, with wherever my family’s map was taking me, I could remember more, could break some part free.
 It was all I would have in my captivity.
 It was the mountains or nothing.
 I could see no other way.

 I wasn’t thinking, period.
 Anyway, Lor knows all this—it’s cool, it’s cool.

The house was quiet when I slipped from bed, trying not to make a sound.
 I peeked into the main room, finding Chevelle sitting against the front wall, a small window over his head.
 He leaned over, working on something in the palm of his hand, a steady scratching accompanying the movement of his wrist.
 I started forward and my boot scuffed the floor, alerting him to my presence.
 As he glanced up, he slid whatever he’d been working on into a pocket at his hip.
 It dawned on me then that the main room had only the entrance and two other doors.
 If we were staying with Ruby then the second room must be hers.
 I meant to offer Chevelle my room to sleep in, but the look on his face was so unnerving I could not stop myself from offering something else.
 “You don’t… you don’t have to protect me.” I hoped it was true.
 “I can turn myself in, take myself to the village, or…” I was trying to say Grand Council, but the words stuck in my throat.

 “Are you a half-ling?” “Yes, how did you know?

What about our families and people who’d ask questions, if we disappear.
 What do we say, oh sorry about that everyone, we just felt like leaving Earth to go to this magical place called Igneeria to do something that we don’t know about.” “Well of course, there will be some minor difficulties,” he said.
 “Minor?” I squeaked.
 “Seriously, did you not hear a word I just said?” He placed his pudgy hands on his small hips.
 “Miss don’t you think that Her Majesty would have this all planned out?
 You don’t have to worry.” Seth twirled his sword.
 “Why not, we have to tell our parents something.” “Sir, don’t worry about a thing.
 All you need to do is go home.
 Everything has been arranged.” “What do you mean, arranged?” Seth asked sharply.

 The other four fell dead from my arrows and Jason's knives.

 I grabbed his coat and forced him to look at me.
 He smirked and I couldn't hold back the urge to slap him.

“Yes, Felewen?”
 Felewen stood beside her and faced the window.
 Her hair was tied in a long, black ponytail, her slender figure covered by rare chainmail crafted of the hardest metals known to the intelligent races.
 She had come from deep within Nellassar, the thriving capital of the Dezren elves, as just one of many that had arrived to protect the town.
 “Many are dying,” Felewen said.
 “The humans have a spellcaster of their own who repelled our ambush.”
 Aurelia nodded.
 She knew something had gone wrong; otherwise, the battle would have been over in seconds.

“I was just, um, I never got a chance to thank you.” Harruq felt his face flush.
 This was the most awful thing he had ever done.
 He’d prefer to face a dragon in unarmed combat.
 He’d have better odds surviving, too, based on Aurelia’s cold, steeled look.
 “You came all the way out here to thank me?
 Hardly sounds like an orcish thing to do.”
 One would not have thought gray skin could turn so red, but it did.

There was almost no redeeming value to most of what she said, but it did have the benefit of being distracting.
 By the time lunch finally came around I needed some kind of distraction.
 This was my only chance to see Les Misérables performed live before I turned forty.
 Unfortunately, while the conversation at Brandon's table was plentiful, it wasn't very distracting.
 I was quickly realizing that Brandon's friends weren't very nice.
 I'd pretty much known Cassie was a wench, but Vincent seemed even meaner.
 While a story about how someone tricked some poor girl into thinking he was going to ask her out was highly illuminating, it wasn't particularly the kind of thing I wanted to dwell on.
 Especially considering how many parallels there were between her story, and mine.
 I kept looking at the clock, and the later it got, the more certain I was that Principal Gossil was just about to get on the loudspeaker and call out the winners of the drawing.
 The last two minutes of lunch dragged on forever, but then the bell rang and I was left sitting stunned as Brandon and his friends stood to go.

The half- orc gripped Condemnation in both hands, snarling as the elf launched his own offensive series.
 The elven blade glided through the air, repeatedly feinting and looping wide so that Harruq’s sword danced about for phantom blows.
 Ahrqur let out a mocking laugh, gave him an obvious feint, and then kicked high.
 The foot smashed the bottom of Harruq’s chin, the same sore part Dieredon had hit.
 Harruq staggered back, his sword swinging wildly.
 The elf charged in, knowing he outmatched the half-orc in speed and skill.
 The kill would be his.

 A sudden purging of blood vessels exploded across Ahrqur’s side.

Had he wanted to, I had no doubt but that he could have easily snapped my neck.
 He was that strong.
 I really was trembling now.
 I wanted to mutter something about overzealous body-builders lifting just to intimidate people, but couldn't get the words out.
 I think maybe I was afraid he'd overhear and return to finish the job.
 My shoulders felt like the skin was on fire, but I knew it was just my imagination.
 His grip had been rock-hard, but he hadn't actually squeezed enough to hurt me.
 He'd shown pretty good control for someone who'd just been spanked in a debate, and obviously wanted to rip my head off.
 Turning around to return to the tutor room, I almost tripped over my own feet when I saw Britney standing just outside the closed door.

Emily raised an eyebrow.
 “Loose who?” “We’ll explain later!” I said and ran after Seth.
 “Right now we have to move!” We dashed up the hill in the direction the monsters were going.
 When we reached the top, Seth stopped and stared down.
 Emily and Jason looked confused but joined us.
 We looked down at the ground and I gasped as I saw all the monsters gather around in a semi-circle, waiting.
 “What are they waiting for?” Emily asked in a hushed voice.
 Seth squinted down.
 “I don’t want to know.” “Do you think it could…?” I asked.

Imeralda nodded, a smile starting to appear on her face.
 “And what would happen if this group of squires tried to take on a Celestial Lion?” she asked.
 Rodregas started to laugh at the idea and then stopped cold.
 He nodded, he understood her point now.
 The two sat quietly for the remaining minutes.
 The dread in his heart was gone; it had no place in the heart of a lion.
 While no speeches had started the other matches, for the first time Rodregas saw the Grand Marshal himself step forward.
 His name was Faurrenida.
 The Grand Marshal was an older man and not a pretty one; his face had more scars than anything else.
 He spoke with a rough voice like he was permanently hoarse from barking commands.

Panicking, she began to run.

 She turned toward his voice.

It all made sense, but didn't explain who'd started it, or why they'd done it.
 Rachel's face told me she wouldn't answer either of those questions.
 I finally settled on one I thought she might answer.
 "Why are you telling me all this?"
 Rachel's face tried to take on her liar's mask, but didn't quite succeed.
 "You risked a lot to stop Cassie from hurting me.
 The least I can do is tell you anything I know that could save you from getting hurt in return."
 She was telling the truth.
 Not all of it, but at least some of it.
 I wanted to tell her she didn't owe me anything, but there were so many questions I needed answered still.

 She gasped.

 "Yeah.

Kind of like a pagan Prom.
 Or maybe a pagan homecoming since it's still fall."
 Prom was my arch-nemesis.
 There were really only two times a year that the universe managed to penetrate my historical indifference to the opposite sex.
 Prom, and Valentine's Day.
 Of the two, Prom was the more deadly.
 Valentine's Day was usually filled with enough examples of guys screwing up to make me feel okay.
 They were always picking the wrong present, forgetting to buy one, or otherwise making the day less than perfect.
 That in turn helped me remember that most relationships seemed to be more fuss and mess than they were worth.

His face paled, his mouth foamed, and then he died, screaming, still screaming._

 “I watched that wretched bully succumb to madness from the disease carried by an undead rat.
 He took something I made for my brother, and I made him pay dearly for it.”

He drew her into his arms, bending to kiss her.
 Her mouth tasted so good, felt so warm and soft.
 He'd give anything to keep her here with him, to marry her and make love to her and spend the rest of his life with her.
 Remembering that she’d said she liked being kissed on the neck, he moved to press his lips to her neck, kissing, nibbling, sucking.
 Marie gasped, threading her fingers into his hair.
 His hands slid down her back, pulling her hard against him, reminding her of how he'd pinned her against his car last night.
 Moaning at the pleasure of the contact, she wrapped her arms around him, wanting to get even closer to him.
 Rick covered her mouth with his again, his kiss so hot and thorough and demanding that it elicited more moans from her.
 He ended the embrace with a series of quick, hard kisses and then eased his hold on her, panting.
 Marie started to reach for him again, but then her eyes narrowed.

A hand touched his forehead.
 All the anger that had raged inside Harruq roared like a fire suddenly loosed upon a dry forest.
 Sweat poured from his skin.
 His head jerked upward, his eyes soaking in the white of Velixar’s hand and the dim glow of the stars.
 Power flowed into him, his muscles stretching and tightening in a chaotic manner.
 “Rise, Harruq Tun,” Velixar said.
 “Revel in the power of Karak.”
 “By the gods, brother, if you could see yourself,” Qurrah said, his voice full of shock and wonder.

As I shielded my eyes with a hand, I noticed the ink on my wrist and smiled.
 I suddenly knew the soaring creature above was a hawk.
 I closed my eyes and relaxed my arm at my side, imagining flying.
 I breathed deep and conjured the image it would see, looking down on us.
 The picture was sharp, even at this distance, but the colors weren’t as clear, and the outlying shapes not as defined.
 I laughed at myself for adding that detail to my daydream, imagining a bird seeing differently.
 My vision sailed over us, past the ridge, south.
 I imagined seeing the twins, perched in two trees, watching.
 Hardwood bows rested high on their backs.
 The wolves were mostly concealed on the ground, vigilant.

He would trust his wiser brother as he always had.
 Qurrah let his eyes drift back to the fire.
 “Tomorrow night, bring me a body, but don’t let yourself be caught.
 A gruesome execution does not suit my immediate plans.”
 “Sure,” Harruq said.
 “Whatever you want.”
 They slept in their pile of hay and cloth.
 Harruq did not wake until late morning, but Qurrah slept far less.

In the middle of the room was an enameled silver table set for two, with Taiga lounging in his throne like chair on the opposite side of Van’dret.
 Van’dret hurried forward and fell to his knees with his head lowered; he did not say a word until after Taiga spoke.
 “Please, my friend, there is no need for subservience here; let us enjoy a meal together.
 If you don’t mind, I have a few thoughts I would like to share with you over the food.” “Of course, my lord,” said Van’dret as he stood up he dared to focus on the Guild Dealer for the first time.
 Taiga wore the form of a High Elf male that was slim and graceful, as was most of its kind.
 His hair and eyes were a striking pale violet color, and his skin was a light nut color which made a strong contrast with his hair.
 This was highlighted by the similarly colored silk toga he wore.
 He wore no rings or accessories, his outfit simple, but extravagant.
 Van’dret suddenly wished he had thought to dress simpler for the occasion his green and emerald outfit with its gold trim seemed garish in comparison; and his human male form that normally seemed attractive and robust seemed ungainly and drab in comparison.

She read books for fun and spoke softly, humbly, and acted just as nice to the lowly as to teachers or big shots.
 Besides, I had lately spent a day and evening, first at school, then at a community dance, and afterward at the Burger Hut, asking people whether they often felt guilty about something but had no idea what it was.
 I asked thirty or forty kids.
 Only one said no.
 Karen.
 Since then, I had spent many hours dreaming that she and I could run off to live in some woodland cottage.
 Maybe near a golf course, since the smashing of golf balls had become my best means of fighting the grief over losing my dad.
 Eric patted my head, which riled me.
 We finished the bourbon, then he offered to show me a wrestling hold he had recently learned.
 He was on the wrestling team, second man in the 165-pound class and challenging the first man, who was part orangutan.

I think Dad heard me, saw that I was progressing beyond his wildest dreams and bought me that electric guitar, without asking Mom, without thinking it was her business, you know?
 He saw that I was really good, that I could be something special.
 So he bought me this electric—it was a Hofner Futurama, if you can believe it.
 My old man…I don’t know what happened to that guitar.

But when it comes to important things, like knowing what a woman wants, well they’re hopeless.

 Otherwise you might end up like me, and that doesn’t seem to appeal to you very much.

I could feel his presence behind and to the left of me, like a gentle tingle of electricity I could've pointed to even with my eyes closed.
 I resisted the urge to look back again as the lights dimmed and the orchestra began the opening strains of the first number.
 The actor playing Jean Valjean strode out onto the stage, and even weighed down by chains, he still commanded everyone's attention as though he was a member of the nobility.
 Each successive character somehow managed to latch onto my heart as they arrived.
 Despite the nagging sensation that I could feel Alec behind me, the first few minutes of the play exceeded all my hopes.
 That all changed when they started 'Lovely Ladies'.
 It was my absolute least favorite song on the whole soundtrack.
 Frankly the whole play would've been better if they'd just left it off.
 Still, sitting through a song about 'ladies of the night' as my mom still called them, had seemed like a small price to pay for getting to listen to the rest of the play.
 By the middle of the song both of the oversexed boys behind me were whispering catcalls.

Environment: Unsustainable lifestyles and consumption (in industrial countries) and population growth, along with rising levels of production and consumption (in developing countries), will place strenuous demands on the environment of the planet.
 Growing damage to the basic life support systems of soil, water, flora, fauna and the atmosphere is taking place in all parts of the world.
 Unemployment: In the West, rising levels of unemployment have increased resistance to free trade and immigration.
 Rising levels of long-term unemployment and youth unemployment in inner cities are associated with the increasing incidence of crime.
 In developing countries, rapid population growth continues to outpace job creation in most regions, resulting in high levels of unemployment, increasing social unrest and large scale migration from rural to urban areas and internationally.
 Gender discrimination: Gender remains a major determinant of privilege and discrimination worldwide.
 Women still suffer from unfavourable sex ratios, lower wages and restraints on property owner ship, as well as higher levels of illiteracy and lower educational attainments.
 Rising violence: Violence is on the increase, especially violence within society in the form of civil wars, crime and drugs.
 During the first half of 1994, 36 armed conflicts were in progress.
 During the past year, more than half a million people perished in Somalia and Rwanda alone.

It was quiet there and I wondered if I had cracked.
 But then it occurred to me that maybe I had been the cause of it.
 I was resigned now, the fury gone, and so was the screeching, the pain.
 They had said the binding was dangerous… There was a collective gasp as they realized I was back.
 I heard someone beside me and a flash of anger swept through me, lighting a flame at whoever it was.
 So maybe the fury wasn’t completely gone.

When all returned, and Dieredon was about to land, a wave of pure sound and energy rippled outward.
 Velixar was waking, and he was angry.
 The wave sent Qurrah crashing against a giant undead man still wearing rusted platemail.
 The collision blasted the air from his lungs.
 When he hit the ground, stars filled his vision.
 Dieredon fought but could not resist that same wave of power.
 The point of his blade halted a foot from the top of the black hood before he flew back.
 In the distance, Qurrah watched his master glaring at the damned elf who had fallen like a mad man.
 “Scoutmaster,” Velixar growled, his voice deep and dark like an ancient daemon of old.
 “Twice you have looked upon me and lived.

“I thought a lot of them used ones that help wizards not to grow old.” “That is true,” said Imeralda with a shrug.
 “A healing sigil is why wizards live so long.
 It is considered by most to be the moral choice instead of the Immortalists’ answer for long life.” “What about you Doi’van?” Rodregas asked.
 “Imeralda says that you are almost as powerful as me as a magician.
 If we found a way, would you like to take on some of the power of the sigils?” he asked.
 Rodregas had expected an immediate response, but instead his question was followed by a long pause before Doi’van answered.

These people I was helping, though not on my own but as a paid reporter, were blessing me.
 Like Curly did at Chapters Books.
 And like Mother Teresa blessed me.
 One Saturday a few years back, my friend Diane called.
 As a lay Missionary of Charity, she knew, and whispered to me, that Mother was around, visiting the MC houses in Tijuana and San Diego, in secret like she did, since she preferred not to get mobbed.
 The MCs rise early.
 Diane said Mother would attend Sunday mass at St. Jude's church at 7 a.m. After a late night at a birthday party up the coast, I staggered from bed to my car and blearily followed Diane's directions.
 St. Jude's is near downtown San Diego, in an old flatland neighborhood of two bedroom homes, vintage Chevrolets so lowered so that sparks fly from underneath, plentiful thrift stores, corner groceries and at least one storefront church on every block.
 Mother Teresa's secret had gotten out.
 People in orange vests directed traffic.

Not in the respectful ‘a lady entered the room’ way, but in a way that led me to believe he wasn’t happy to have me, or anyone, find him there.
 He held a long staff, gripped so tightly his knuckles whitened, and he was dressed in casual traveling clothes that didn’t seem to fit his posture.
 I found myself questioning whether it were a disguise, and then I chastised myself for wandering around in ridiculous thoughts so often.
 They were watching me.
 Cursed brain fog.
 I stood there for a moment, unsure if I should leave the room after I had so obviously interrupted or pretend I had a mission and make my way to Ruby’s room.
 I clearly wasn’t welcome there.
 Neither spoke, so I lowered my gaze to the floor, taking the shortest route to Ruby’s door and closing it hastily behind me.

 The blade dropped as the guard held his blackened hand before him, bits of white bone catching the moonlight.

The large green eyes demanded something of him even as the animals lay in apparent complete relaxation, sprawled on the stone floor.
 He had to let them out, but how was he going to do that?
 If he simply opened the door, they might tear him apart.
 Rodregas thought the cats may also attack the guard at the front gate on their way out.
 He looked around and realized that the other side of the hall had a door that opened in the same direction as the door leading to the cage.
 He opened it up and thought that if he opened the Dire Cats’ door, he could block them from this direction, while keeping himself safe behind the two doors.
 He knew the guards at the gate would be incredibly curious about what he had been doing, but they would not actually do anything to challenge the man they thought was the Sorcerer Ravenhurr.
 He also knew that he would have to get them out of the way of the Dire Cats.
 At least that way he could also claim the black yew recurve bows.
 Rodregas walked back up the stairs and he thought that it would be a good idea to feed the beasts first, but he did not have time to grab a couple of chickens in the coop next to the kitchen.

Next he went to the study door only to find it locked.
 He looked for a key but there was nothing.
 He guessed that it was locked by magic and required a magic word or incantation to open the lock.
 He pushed and pulled on the door, but it was solidly made and there was nothing to get a good hold of to test his new strength.
 He looked around for something to use as a pry bar; next to the fireplace was a poker.
 He grabbed it and forced it into the crack were a normal door would have its catch.
 He got it wedged in good but then stopped and went over to the outside door and opening it, listened for anyone nearby before going back inside the room.
 He carefully closed the door behind him; the sound of him breaking down the study door would ring loud in the predawn silence, but his need for money was too great.
 What he had found would be worth some good coin but finding a trader that would give him its worth would take time.
 He needed to find silver and gold.

I almost couldn't believe those words were really coming out of my mouth.
 I wanted to blame it on how close he was standing, or how tired I was, or anything else that might be remotely believable, but based on how serious his face had just become, it was too late to take it all back.
 "That doesn't strike me as being a much better solution."
 I felt my neck and face begin to burn from embarrassment.
 I took a step back, and reached for the door, hoping to beat a quick retreat before I could humiliate myself further, but he stopped me with a surprisingly gentle hand.
 "I'm sorry; that didn't come out as intended.
 If it would help you sleep, of course I'll come upstairs and sit with you.
 It's the least I can do after allowing you to be dragged into this mess."
 Alec followed me upstairs, and then slid down the wall to sit on the floor as I sat down on my bed.
 As soon as I was comfortable he reached up and flipped off the light.

The rest of lunch flew by.
 I'd never realized how much fun it could be to belong to a group.
 Things weren't ideal; I'd never met a group with so many inside jokes.
 Half the time I felt like there was an entire conversation being carried on over my head, but sitting next to Brandon left me with such a tingly feeling all along my right side that I didn't really mind.
 Not even the presence of a pop quiz in History managed to faze me.
 Almost before I knew it I was sitting down in Physics.
 As usual, Alec slipped into class a half second before the bell.
 I was so happy I forgot how arrogant he was, and I smiled at him as he sat down.
 It was like he was looking at something that wasn't even human.
 My insides seemed to freeze and shrink.

"I want to make love to you more than I want to take my next breath.
 And if you said yes, I'd stop thinking altogether and spend all night making love to you.
 But when all I had left was my memories, I'd feel guilty that I'd taken your virginity and let you go back to 1927 with the guilt I know you'd feel.
 And-and I'd never know if maybe you were pregnant."
 The horrifying thought gripped his mind.
 "If we'd made love, you might have gotten pregnant and then gone back to 1927, and I would never have known that I had a child."
 That thought cooled his desire faster than anything else could have.
 He thought she might have changed her mind about staying if they'd made love—but what if they'd made love and she hadn't?

He felt like he was approaching a mountain, not a tree.
 “Imeralda!” he yelled.
 “Where are you?” Rodregas started to circle the tree, something that he quickly realized might take a while to accomplish.
 Then he saw her.
 Rodregas had been trying to look into the tree, thinking of his experience of being pulled into the Night Panther.
 But then he heard a noise and looked up and saw that she was on a branch high above, looking incredibly small.
 She seemed to be trying to reach something.
 “Imeralda!” he yelled at her.

Improving the quality and quantity of productive skills is essential to implementing the strategies for peace, democratization, food security, economic growth and full employment set forth in this report.
 The phenomenal growth of East Asian countries is the direct result of their massive investments in upgrading the skills of the workforce.
 Rather than generating excess workers, rising productivity has generated greater demand for labour.
 Labour productivity in South Korea rose 11 per cent per year between 1963 and 1979, mostly due to investment in education and skills.
 This increase has been accompanied by a growing shortage of labour, equivalent to 1 per cent of the workforce in 1991.
 Investment in education and training helped Thailand raise labour productivity by 63 per cent during 1980–5.
 It, too, is moving from a labour surplus to a labour shortage economy.
 An enormous range and depth of physical, technical, organizational, managerial and social skills are needed in order to utilize constructively the freedom which democracy provides, the productive power of new technologies, and the efficiency of modern institutions and systems to achieve greater developmental results.
 These skills admit of constant and continuous improvement without limit, in the same way that technology and organization can always be further improved.
 A comparative survey of the level and quality of skills in any country with those of countries above and below it on scales of economic and human development will reveal the crucial role of skills in development.

They think the animals understand.
 They follow the wolves, you see.
 That is why they are here.” We topped the ridge, jagged rock and loose dirt shifting beneath our feet, and Ruby dropped the quiver by the edge before climbing down with a deftness I had yet to master.
 Steed, Anvil, and Grey greeted us before we resumed training.
 I tried to keep my mind off the wolves, off the reason we were training, off the encounter with Chevelle, off all of the terrible things it kept returning to, and I was grateful for the fog that clouded my thoughts.
 Though I wasn’t exactly winning matches, I was getting better.
 The battering continued, and long days of constant fighting were making me tired.
 We took a break and I leaned back on a rock, staring at the sky as I rested.
 Chevelle walked me to the edge of a tall peak.

It was just something one gets good at when one is in constant training.
 My parents—I had been instructed to refer to Dino as my father—entertained a lot.
 The rooms would fill with drinkers and drunks, for it was the seventies and the cocktails were flowing freely.
 The money was coming in heavy and Mom and Dino lived a lavish lifestyle.
 They went out to dinner at fancy restaurants often, and everyone knew their names as they entered.
 He had his own table at several places and the same personal waiter.
 He was treated like royalty.
 I remember he would carry a rare $1000 bill and attempt to pay his bill with it to shock the waiters, who would say, “We can’t change that!” My mom was wearing fur coats and new jewelry all the time.
 Dino was “in the import-export” business; we would later find out that he was involved in a criminal enterprise and during this time was smuggling diamonds.
 It was not unusual for Dino’s associates to come to the house with weapons inside their jackets.

Sigil Warriors - Those who are born with magical talent but do not wish to be sorcerers have the opportunity inscribe a sigil on their magic talent that uses up a portion of their magical ability.
 Lesser sigils are simple such as health, strength, quickness.

1.World Employment Programme: Raising incomes and creating jobs in the developing countries is the best way to promote global economic growth and employment generation in the coming decades.
 The World Summit on Social Development should call for a comprehensive World Employment Programme to stimulate more rapid growth in developing countries as an engine for global economic expansion.
 The International Labour Organization has operated a programme for the past two decades, but solution of the employment problem requires an integrated approach that transcends the scope of any single international agency.
 The programme should establish specific objectives and co ordinate efforts to stimulate international investment, increase labour market flexibility, promote productive skills, diffuse technology, eliminate protectionist trade policies that retard growth, increase trade between developing countries, and promote international cooperation on taxation systems to encourage more labour-oriented tax codes.
 2.Coordination of macro-economic policies: The efforts of the industrial nations to achieve higher rates of economic growth and job creation are stymied by the need to maintain macro-economic stability at the same time.
 Due to the competition between OECD members to attract financial resources, rising interest rates or falling inflation rates in one country influence the inflow and outflow of financial resources from other members of the community.
 The efforts to curb inflation at the expense of slower economic growth and job creation need not be so rigorous, if OECD members more closely coordinated their policies to support macro-economic expansion.
 A modest, relatively uniform rise in inflation rates within the OECD would not then result in a significant movement of resources or fluctuation in exchange rates.
 3.Shift investment from defence to education and training: Reduce global defence spending by an additional 50 per cent before the end of the decade to below a maximum threshold of $400 billion.
 Invest at least 10 per cent of the global savings from defence cuts in education and training.

I tried to grab a hold of his arm, but he'd already taken several steps away.
 The pleasant tingly feeling was gone, but that loss was nothing against the sense of cold abandonment rushing through me.
 I tried to step forward, tried to follow him, but my vision was dimming and my heart felt like it was about to explode.
 I managed a single step before my knees collapsed and the ground jumped up to meet me.
 Consciousness was slow returning.
 When my eyes finally fluttered open, I was surprised to find myself in Alec's arms once again.
 "Are you okay?"
 He tried to set me down, to stand me up on my feet, but I grabbed onto him as tightly as my shaking arms were able.

 Throw in Jasmin's congratulations, which seemed to indicate the passing grade had been nothing less than inevitable, with Alec taking my hand as soon as I sat down, and Jessica and James' lack of response didn't matter at all.
 With Isaac's reassuring presence at my side in History, I weathered the renewed gossip, apparently occasioned by the entire pack's absence during lunch for the second day in a row, and soon found myself reunited with Alec in Physics.
 As luck would have it, Mrs. Alexander was gone again, and the substitute was typically clueless about what we were supposed to be doing.
 Alec of course spent the whole class unearthing other little bits of embarrassing information.
 I'd never experienced anything like it, every question I answered spawned two more, and he invariably seemed to figure out the underlying reasons I'd done a given thing, or reacted a certain way.
 I'd just finished describing my failed tryout for the school's production of To Kill a Mockingbird, when he hit me with a completely unexpected question.

If the greater freedom and higher expectations are unable to find means for their positive fulfilment, they can lead to rising frustration, tension and violence, which threaten the prosperity of those at higher levels and the stability of the society as a whole.
 Democracies can only thrive and the revolution of rising expectations can only fulfil itself peacefully, when economic opportunities are provided to every human being.
 The recent rise of the political right, ethnic unrest and opposition to immigration in Western Europe, and the surge of crime in the United States, are sufficient evidence of the corrosive impact that unemployment can have, even on mature democracies.
 Increasingly, those excluded from the benefits of modern society reject its standards of justice and ignore its laws.
 The end of the ideological confrontation between capitalism and communism leaves the market system exposed at its weakest point – its impersonality and insensitivity to human needs and suffering – with no longer any lesser alternative to point at in self-justification.
 Having rejected the inadequacies and abuses of authoritarian socialism as a solution, we are compelled to find other methods to achieve social equity.
 In the present context, employment is the most effective way to distribute the fruits of development among people.
 The world is now capable of producing sufficient food and other basic necessities to feed, clothe and house everyone; but without opportunities for employment, people lack the purchasing power needed to buy them.
 Economic entitlement, rather than a shortage of food or food production capacity, is the key to global food security.
 Lack of employment opportunities is also directly linked to destruction of the environment, both rural and urban.

As they walked out the door both cats gave him a casual glance as he held the two doors firmly closed together bracing for the weight if they threw themselves at the doors, but they just walked by and headed up the stairs.
 He wanted to follow, but Rodregas held himself back patiently waiting until it was safe.
 They might look like lions, but he knew they were smarter than any beast, and they could be setting him up.
 Finally after waiting what seemed like forever, but was probably only about twenty minutes, Rodregas slowly made his way back up through the keep.
 When he poked his head out the entrance there was no sign of Dire Cats or chickens, but he did note a few stray feathers in the courtyard.
 Other than a few alarmed sounds from the chicken coop, it was surprisingly quiet.
 Rodregas felt a feeling of relief at the idea that the lions had eaten.
 Still, he double-checked the keep and the courtyard very carefully before bringing out the cart and the horses and loading up all his booty.
 The cart groaned with the load.
 After a last check for Dire Cats in front of the keep he headed out and away from both Raven Keep and Raven Town and away from his old life.

I felt my heart speed up as Rachel met my eyes with more gravity even than normal.
 "They aren't always completely in control, Adri.
 They try, and some of them are really good.
 Alec is probably the most controlled person I've ever met, and Isaac is so disciplined he's almost immune to the power plays.
 Even so, sometimes it's like they operate on a shorter fuse than the rest of us."
 My throat was so dry it took me two attempts to clear it.
 "Could Alec have won?"

It was useless.
 The separate pieces of information skittered about on the edge of my memory without ever becoming tangible enough to relate to the answer I needed.
 By the time class ended, I'd almost completely shut down.
 I registered the whispers as I made my way to English.
 I normally would've been mad, or possibly embarrassed, but it was like my feelings were wrapped in layers of cotton candy.
 If I really pushed, I could faintly feel the hard edges, but there were so many layers shrouding them.
 I just couldn't seem to muster up enough concentration to care.
 I was on autopilot now.
 I answered Britney's whispered questions without ever registering them and never once worried about whether or not I'd made sense.
 I parried Mrs. Campbell's concerned inquiries in much the same manner, probably not convincing her that I was okay, but at least persuading her to leave me alone, and then sleep-walked into the cafeteria.

The only thing I have to look forward to are the few breaks I get to go out on my own, into the pines.
 Father has increased my work periods to every other day.
 Combined with my other duties, I am stationed in the castle almost all week.
 The magic practice exhausts me or I would sneak out at night, the way I enjoyed as a child.
 It doesn’t seem fair.
 My sister is practically ignored.
 Father clearly prefers me, but sometimes I wonder if that is really better.
 She wanders idly around the castle, no practice, no duties, no formal gatherings.

 Harruq shifted, the dark expression on his brother’s face making him uncomfortable.

 “A town called Woodhaven.
 Well, two towns really, Celed and Singhelm.

Whoever lived here was either incredibly well read, or a complete poser who bought books just for show.
 Almost scared to find out which it was, I reached over and pulled out the copy of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and opened it up to find a well-cared-for book that'd still obviously been read several times.
 I carefully slid the book back into its spot and then noticed the faintest glimmer of light coming from an open doorway off to my right.
 It was an art gallery.
 One covered in pictures that were eerily familiar, all with a circular signature at the bottom right hand corner.
 They were mostly of mundane kinds of things, landscapes, or people, but there were overtones that caressed a hidden chord inside my soul.
 Everything was done in drab, painfully boring colors, overlaid with incredibly vibrant, hues that were almost unreal in their perfection.
 It wasn't until I'd moved around a corner and entered what looked like a new phase for the painter that I figured out why the paintings looked so familiar despite the fact that I'd never seen any of the places or people depicted.
 The realization hit with such force that it distracted me from the familiarity of the signature.
 The new pieces were all breathtaking.

He promised to.
 But he didn’t.
 Eric told him not to, I would learn the next day.
 Eric, whom no one recalled having done a single mean act, or said a single mean word, had told Kenny to leave us behind.
 When Kenny asked him to explain, he only insisted he didn’t want Billy or me along.
 He wouldn’t say why.
 That night on Viejas grade, Mike was driving when they swerved off the road and careened down an embankment.
 On account of some miracle or quirk of physics, the little car didn’t roll, only slammed down on a wide ledge in the mountainside.
 Eric was riding shotgun, where I might've been, since I was taller and longer-legged than any of the others except Mike Beatty, who was driving.

“She came in on a bad wind and left on another,” one roadie told me.
 “Lori was beautiful, a beautiful person, a beautiful body, but she was half siren.
 She couldn’t help it,” another groupie remembers.
 “She was Satan’s mistress,” a musician, who wishes to remain anonymous, summed her up.
 That first night Buddy went home with her.
 What happened there is shrouded in mystery, except Skippy recalls Buddy saying, “She had the most beautiful sex I’ve ever seen.
 It tasted like mushrooms and ginger ale.
 And its musk stayed on me for days, like it had gone subcutaneous, like it had replaced my own body odor.” Perhaps this was her hex: Ruthah: The perfume of Immortality.

I thought I remembered where the closest drinking fountain was.
 Even so, I planned on getting a little lost before I found it.
 I didn't, however, plan on nearly colliding with Alec as he slowly rounded the corner in front of me.
 The tension of the near-fight earlier had distracted me from just how incredible-looking he was.
 There was no such refuge now.
 For a moment I couldn't think of anything other than how the dark blue of his shirt brought out his tan complexion.
 If his gorgeousness had stopped there, I probably would've been okay, but the little spirits in charge of keeping the universe in equilibrium must've been momentarily busy with something more important.
 The blue buttons that kept his shirt snuggly wrapped around his impressive torso were almost the exact shade of his eyes, which happened to be staring at me with a trace of something different than his normal self-assurance.
 In someone else I would've almost said gratitude, but his manner was too arrogant for that.
 More than anything else, that was what finally shook me from my reverie.

It was entirely my fault.
 I shouldn't have tried to squeeze past you like that."
 The smile was still there.
 That had to be a good sign.
 Usually when people said something nice and didn't mean it their smiles only lasted as long as they were speaking.
 I tried a tentative smile in return and his widened slightly.
 "I'm Brandon."
 Feeling more than a little nervous, I allowed him to capture my right hand in his.
 "I'm Adr...Adriana."

With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, technology and economic activity in support of fighting forces became an increasingly significant factor.
 As a result, more and more effort was directed at eliminating or crippling the enemy’s economic and industrial capacity and the ‘national will’ to wage war.
 Targeting of civilian populations became increasingly common.
 In the two world wars in this century, opposing sides waged all-out war against the military, political, economic and social resources and capacities of the enemy society.
 The strategic bombings of the Second World War, the fire-bombing of Tokyo, and the nuclear devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki took this concept to the extreme.
 As a result, the ratio of military to civilian casualties in military conflicts changed dramatically.
 In the First World War, there were 20 military casualties for each civilian death.
 In the Second World War, the ratio was one to one.
 In the Korean War, civilian deaths out numbered military losses five to one.
 In the Vietnam War, this ratio rose to 20 to one.

U.S. Nuclear Weapons Command, all three of the 2-front92m battles0m had higher numbers of civilian92m casualties0m because of the greater amount of military effort involved.

The way he talked was eerie and distressing, as if he meant to leave tomorrow and probably never come home.
 On his more effusive evenings, he might offer advice and wrest promises out of me.
 He asked for a promise that I would go straight to college, because a guy as smart as me simply ought to, and it would please my mom, who could use some cheering after her sorrows.
 He had witnessed how any talk of college made her glow.
 Besides, he didn’t want to see me get drafted.
 “You’d have a hell of a time in the service,” he said.
 “A teacher barks at you, it’s all you can do not to punch the guy.
 Think of what’d happen with a drill sergeant.
 You’d spend all your time locked up.” Twice he made me promise to watch over Billy, to be like a big brother, since Billy wouldn’t have him anymore.
 I said, “Why doesn’t he have you anymore?” “I mean after I’m gone.” “Well, you’re still here,” I said.

I've already told Lucy where she stands with Ben.
 If you get in my way, if you approach him on her behalf, if you even think of acting on any of the hundred things going through your mind right now, I'll kill you too."
 My knees were weak, but I had to get out now.
 For all that I hated Cassie, there was no way this crazy chick would act on her threats when there were three of us to corroborate each other's stories.
 I quietly swung the stall door open and felt my eyes go wide as I saw Lucy curled up, sobbing, at Jasmin's feet.
 Neither of the other girls even bothered to look at me as I carefully moved to the door.
 Jasmin took half a step to the side, giving me room to get around her, but there wasn't even a slight drop in the level of menace she was radiating.
 It was like I didn't even exist.
 I was still shaking on my way down the hall.

But at least I knew we were closer.
 When we came through the pass our path widened, but the horses didn’t separate as I had expected them to.
 I decided I’d had enough of that.
 “How do I control Steed?” I could see the humor in his eyes at my phrasing, but he kept a straight face.
 “Think of where you want him to go and lead his head so.” I concentrated on turning left and we were instantly spinning, the unexpected twirl throwing me half from my saddle.
 Chevelle caught my arm and righted me on my now-still horse.
 “Maybe not so severe next time.” My face heated, but I focused on the horse’s head again, turning him back to our course as I gave a small nudge with my heels.
 I was cautious after that but it became easier to control his movement as we rode.
 I practiced guiding him, eventually even maneuvering him back and forth between the misshapen rocks and spiky brush on our way.
 I was still afraid to have him kneel when we stopped for the evening, though, imagining him rolling on top of me if I tried.

While the lasagna she'd made for dinner baked, she made a list of what she wanted to buy the next day.
 They needed new beach towels and more sunscreen and aloe vera lotion.

 She didn't want to ask Rick for anything frivolous, and she'd probably get to wear the dress only once or twice.
 But she didn't want him to be embarrassed by a companion who wasn't dressed appropriately.
 Well, she'd ask him where he planned to take her and what she should wear.
 "Why don't we find you a nice, simple dress?"

She'd seen airplanes before, but she'd never been in one.

 When she'd finished, Marie pointed to an overhead panel and asked Rick, "Is this where the oxygen masks fall from?"

It seemed only a moment, but when my eyes opened again the scene had changed.

In the least developed countries, foreign aid has declined by 24 per cent but this has been offset by a 29-fold increase in foreign investment, so that the combination of foreign aid and foreign investment as a percentage of GDP has remained constant.
 If the rich countries, particularly USA, had met the UN development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of GDP, progress in improving the human condition in countries characterized by a high incidence of poverty would have been faster.
 These real and significant gains have been offset and to a large extent obscured in our minds by the persistence and aggravation of problems that constitute the other side of the post-Cold War ledger.
 Far from vanishing, the nuclear danger has been aggravated by the continued proliferation of nuclear weapons, the increasing danger of these weapons falling into the hands of terrorists, and the stubborn refusal of the existing nuclear powers to seize the opportunity to totally eradicate this pernicious arsenal of self-annihilation.
 Reduced confrontation between nation states has been followed by an aggravation of internal conflicts within countries as well as a dramatic increase in threats of violence by disenchanted minorities.
 Violent local conflicts continue to flare around the world.
 Terrorist acts have intensified against civilian populations on every continent.
 While the worst fears about rising unemployment in the West have been dispelled, the challenge of generating sufficient employment opportunities for all people around the world remains a pressing concern.
 The rich-poor divide has increased within and between nations.

My only other experience had been so terrible that I nearly panicked, but before I could formulate a protest, or even decide if a protest was what I wanted, our flesh touched.
 The contact immediately drove every other thought from my mind.
 His lips were the perfect combination of firm and soft, and the heart that'd been all but stopped a second before sped up to heart attack rates, slamming itself against my chest in an effort to get closer to him.
 All of my senses were blending together.
 I couldn't tell if he smelled incredible, tasted like heaven, or if it was all just a side effect of the energy which had gone from tingling to crackling as soon as our faces touched.
 My inhibitions, the ones that'd always kept me from acting on the occasional amorous impulse, evaporated sometime in the first half second, and I found myself with both arms wrapped around his neck, clinging to him with all my strength.
 Later I'd probably claim it was to steady myself against the wave of dizziness, but right now I knew it was because I wanted him more than anything I'd ever experienced.
 Alec pulled me away, held me at arm's length while I gasped for air, and then once I calmed down a little, he smiled and pulled me in close again, just for a hug this time.
 I tried to turn it into a kiss, but he deftly avoided my attempt, burying his face in my hair.
 "I'd like to, I truly would, but I don't think that would be fair to you.

In the morning, Eric read it.
 No doubt he could have told me the theme wasn’t much different from my dream of going off with Karen to a secluded cabin, or from my quitting the baseball team so I could spend afternoons alone smashing golf balls.
 But Eric rarely gave answers to questions we could solve on our own.
 In that, he was like God, who perhaps respects us more than we deserve.
 In The Brothers Karamazov, Fyodor Dostoyevski gives a story of Jesus coming to earth during the Spanish inquisition.
 He only heals a few of the suffering crowd before soldiers arrest and deliver him to the Grand Inquisitor.
 That old fellow commences to tell him where he went wrong.
 Jesus, says this astute theologian, attempted to give people freedom, when most of them want nothing to do with freedom.
 Their cravings are for food and other comforts, for easy answers to questions no matter how complex or perplexing, and for entertainment, to relieve them of the need to think.
 Eric, like Jesus, loved people too much to usurp their freedom by giving them what their lesser natures wanted.

I would simply suggest that you keep your eyes open, and keep your  mind a little more focused both on your journey and at the Cathedral,” Van’dret’s tone almost dismissed his own comment as a simple chatter of no import.
 Accept Van’dret had been invited to have lunch with one of the most powerful people on the planet to drop the simply suggestion that he should keep his eyes open for something unusual at the Cathedral of the Heavens.
 The rest of the dinner quickly wrapped up, and Van’dret soon found himself caught up in thought as he journeyed down several floors to the Great Hall that served as the gathering place for the other Immortalist in residence in the city.
 His questing mind was rudely interrupted by a woman stepping to his side and asking him, “so did you ask him?” “Ask him what?” Van’dret asked.
 The Immortalist Sorcerer in the form of a tall athletic human female with spectacular long red hair and blue eyes gave Van’dret a silent glare before responding.
 “Last night at the arena party you agreed to ask Van’dret where Oreintvenir is,” She replied in a clear clipped voice.
 “Actually,” Van’dret responded, “I think I said that my visit to his solar would be a perfect opportunity to ask him if he knew the location of our missing Grand Master.” “So why did you not take advantage of the opportunity?
 If anyone knows where Oreintvenir is; it is Taiga” “My lovely Gracella, you are an Immortalist of impressive power and intellect.
 But we are Immortalist, time is on our side and Grand Master Oreintvenir has been gone for less than a year.
 It is not unusual for one of his power to be gone for such a length of time.

I'd like for her and Marie to get to know each other better."
 "Why don't we wait until tomorrow?
 I think we should give Marie a chance to rest and readjust."
 "I'm fine."
 "No, Mother's right.
 Tomorrow will be better."
 They ate lunch at 12:30, and Marie could tell that both men were feeling a little restless.
 "Why don't you two go to the office for a few hours?"

When Darcy arrived, the sight of her instantly flushed my heart of that vow against loving.
 I would sooner have risked any torment than given up my bond with that perfect little girl.
 I became a different fellow.
 Once you start loving, you can’t just direct it where you please.
 Love has a mind of its own.
 Our marriage was already rocky when we decided to go for another kid.
 Laura wanted another and I agreed, though a counselor we tried working with contended that until we had resolved certain issues, another child would hardly be practical.
 But practicality ranks at the bottom of my aptitude profile, just below biology and basketball.
 We were vagabonds, back then.
 When Darcy was two months old we moved to Iowa for my gradual school (for a definition of "gradual" see or read The World According to Garp, by John Irving who was my first professor there).

His new body was very large and very muscular, and much stronger than he would have guessed.
 Rodregas lifted his right arm and curled it into a tight muscle.
 He felt the biceps with his free hand.
 The texture under the skin felt like bundles of large, powerful cables.
 He felt his face break into a smile; he had seen this face smile when it had been a prisoner.
 The smile the prisoner had worn was a very open charming smile.
 The smile he felt on his face now had little resemblance to the one he remembered seeing, though without looking in the mirror he had no way of knowing for sure.
 “Come on up, Korin.
 I have a surprise for you,” Rodregas whispered under his breath.
 He went around the room one final time poking around for anything else of note and, finding nothing, went over to the door to the water closet.

Jim – Did I miss something?
 Liz – Well yes and no.
 Jim – That was the dumbest practical joke I’ve ever seen.
 Liz – Another thing Johnny and Gene have been doing since summer ended.
 Stupid practical jokes.
 Jim – Gene promised Art he would stay out of trouble.
 Liz – Well he hasn’t gotten into trouble yet.
 You’ve missed a lot of stupid practical jokes.
 Mostly those two play them on one another, sometimes on Art.
