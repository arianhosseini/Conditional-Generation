As she wandered off, Rick focused his mind on the TV shows they'd watched last night.
 He replayed all the details of the plots, being sure that he saw, in his mind's eye, all the colors.
 Then he began thinking about planes, remembering his trip with Marie to Los Angeles.
 Then he thought about all the computer programs he used and how to troubleshoot them.
 He'd just started listing microwave products in his mind when Marie returned.
 He rose and went to hug her.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, immediately kicking himself for his hypocrisy.
 She sighed, letting herself be comforted by his embrace.

Prosperity, which eliminates hunger, also tends to eliminate violence.
 Even in war-ravaged Africa, experience shows that where food is plentiful, war is avoided.
 The converse is also true.
 Historically, war and civil strife have been the single greatest cause of famines.
 In addition to destroying crops and food supplies, it disrupts food distribution through the use of sieges and blockades.
 In the past decade, war has had a greater impact on food supplies in Africa, particularly the Sahelian region, than have the severe droughts that periodically plague the continent.
 Freedom from hunger and political freedom go hand in hand.
 As subsistence agriculture and periodic famine were the economic foundations of monarchy and feudalism, the generation of agricultural surpluses that stimulated commercialism, and later industrialization, have formed the basis for the rise of democratic institutions.
 Greater freedom for individual action and ownership both stimulate and are supported by greater productivity in agriculture.
 Authoritarian government is frequently either the result or the cause of food shortages – its use of force justified on the one hand to meet a crisis situation or necessitated on the other to restore order and initiate emergency measures.

Is it right, just, meet?
 What’s the difference?
 At some point, at some fulcrum point, I understood.
 Today, Bob Dylan remains a force in my life, though now, he’s also a pal.
 And I can go to him—to his songs--when I am blue, when I am feeling that the world is a place of malefaction and discommoded energy, when I am feeling that there is nothing to be said for the human race, and I can be readjusted.
 How this happens, why this happens, is secondary to the fact that it does.
 I can listen to “Frankie Lee and Judas Priest” or “Visions of Johanna” or “On the Road Again” or “Clothesline Saga” or “Watching the River Flow” and feel that there are angels within humankind.
 I can feel that we are not all lost in the caliginous wastes of our hopelessly chaotic lives.

 "After the things I've seen you go through I'd never doubt your willpower, Adri."
 It was rare that I suffered from a panic attack in Alec's presence but the reference to what I'd lost, combined with my dreaded nickname nearly did the trick.
 As my pulse sped up again Alec pulled me in close.

It worked.
 He threw his hands up, covering his face, screaming.
 But he did not attack me.
 As I rose back to find my next target, I saw the wolves.
 They were also not being attacked, fighting with no opposition.
 And then I remembered what Chevelle had said.
 They would not kill the animals.
 As I laughed, the hawk screeched, and Chevelle and Steed glanced up at the sound.
 They were fighting, almost back to back, the bodies of councilmen strewn around them.

 I started college and rented an apartment with Kenny Niedermeyer who was suffering more than any of us over Eric’s death, since the car was his and Sylvia blamed him.
 She would call and scream “Murderer!” and accuse him of stealing the twenty dollars Eric took with him that day.
 Here's something she wrote and sent him: Jingle for Rope Jumpers Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear, Eric's dead.
 They pushed him, and they beat him and they smashed him in the head.
 He gurgled and he growled, he suffered and he bled.

The attack had been more sudden than usual and nobody had been close enough to catch me.
 In those circumstances experience had shown that I led with my head.
 "It was just the heat here.
 I'm not used to it.
 Now please put me down."
 Alec looked at me doubtfully, then took a deep, no doubt calming breath, and shrugged.
 The movement seemed too casual, almost as if he was angry, but trying to hide it.
 I wanted to try and make eye contact to test my hypothesis, but was afraid of what I'd see.
 The tingling was spreading, no doubt a bad sign.
 Maybe I'd hit my head even harder than I thought.

For one thing that would be stupid, and for a second you seem to be climbing ever higher into the Arida Mountains and that is hardly the best way north.” Rodregas nodded.
 He hoped to make it to his hideaway by nightfall, so he decided it did not hurt to share his plan at this point.
 “You’re right; we are not going to the Northern Kingdoms.
 A few companions and I were hiding out in the Aridas and in one of the higher hollows I found an old farmhouse.
 It has been abandoned for a long time, but it is well made and there is water and lots of fruit trees and berry bushes that must be left over from an old orchard.” After a moment he added, “I always thought that if I ever needed a place to hide out that it was ideal.
 Of course it will be rough there.
 Outside of what we bring, there will not be much.
 But it will be a good place to rest and…” he said gently patting his stomach, “heal up.
 We should be there by nightfall.” “Not bad,” said Imeralda.
 “Sounds like a place that will be hard to find, but is this not territory infested with wild Dire beast?” “Yup,” Rodregas said, “another reason I think this area is usually hard to find; most people stay clear.” He continued after a pause to let them think of entering territory known to be the hunting range of feared predators, “I never saw any sign of any Dire beast in the hollows when I was there, but, of course, they probably know of the place.

 --Adriana Chapter 7 My alarm clock jerked me out of a thankfully dream-free slumber.
 Actually, as I pulled myself out of bed I realized I'd had a virtual torrent of dreams, but none of them had been possessed of the strange vividness that'd begun haunting my waking moments.
 I hadn't had one of the special dreams, ergo I hadn't had any dreams last night.
 I really needed to get out of this town before whatever was in the water drove me completely crazy.
 Actually, I probably didn't have much time in which to affect my escape.
 When it came to craziness I was already halfway there.
 After all, I'd already been diagnosed with the kind of clinical condition nobody with less than eight years of school could even pronounce.

“Well?” she asked.
 “Well what?” He looked up, his face blank and his eyes wide as if he hadn’t a clue.

 “Did you cast a spell on yourself or something?
 Look like one to me.”
 She stood and took up her staff.
 Instead of grabbing his swords, Harruq ducked behind a tree.
 “Don’t hurt me,” he shouted.

He plopped down and sighed.
 “Something must be wrong with me,” he said.
 “Shut up and start telling me more about yourself.”

 “Well, this isn’t a happy tale, but it’s the only one I can think of.

 I didn't expect for them to tell monster girl off, or that I'd recognize the new voice as belonging to Cassie.
 The first girl was still whimpering.
 It nearly covered up the distant sound of some kind of machinery kicking on and creating a barely-audible two-part growl that made the air shiver.
 "You can't get away with this."
 Cassie's voice was barely recognizable, a tattered shadow of her usual arrogance.

Five weeks and two days.
 And they had no idea what had happened to her.
 "I love you, sweetheart."
 She smiled, his words bringing her out of her reverie.
 Yesterday he'd told her he loved her more times than he had the previous four or five days combined.
 And that was saying a lot.
 He hated having to go to work this morning.
 What if, now that he was trying so hard not to think about anything in 1927, his mind wandered to it?
 He knew he wouldn't be able to bear it if he went home and found that she had disappeared.

I had to look around the room twice before I finally spotted the speakers to the system.
 They were built into the walls and ceiling, and based on their number and varying sizes I had a sneaking suspicion they'd produce nearly as much volume as the monsters professional DJs brought to dances.
 Based on the amount of money involved in setting up such a system in the first place, they probably cranked all that out without even the slightest hint of distortion.
 As impressive as the stereo no doubt was, it was all of those shelves filled with books that finally pulled me off of the bed and onto the incredibly lush, maroon carpet.
 Emerson, Ayn Rand, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy were all present.
 Whoever lived here was either incredibly well read, or a complete poser who bought books just for show.
 Almost scared to find out which it was, I reached over and pulled out the copy of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and opened it up to find a well-cared-for book that'd still obviously been read several times.
 I carefully slid the book back into its spot and then noticed the faintest glimmer of light coming from an open doorway off to my right.
 It was an art gallery.

Her eyes narrowed when she replied to him, matter-of-factly, “Your mouth is very small.
 It’s unattractive.” And her head bobbed side to side as she smiled, pleased with herself.

 He was holding someone by the arm, preventing them from running away.
 Suddenly, my vision changed and I was a hawk, attacking, tearing a piece from his tongue.

 She stood right in front of its head and opened her mouth, bizarre sounds started coming out.
 We all stood there mesmerized as she grunted, growled, snorted and hissed at the dragon.
 I expected it to just take a huge bite out of her, but it seemed as surprised as we were.
 “Emily, what's going on?” I shouted to her and started to walk over.
 Seth reached out and grabbed my arm.

 Their sparring ended, Harruq and Aurelia sat side-by-side against a tree, both glistening with sweat.

 “You’re going to be beating my ass in a few weeks if you keep learning as fast as you are.”
 “Don’t worry,” she said, patting his hand.

It put them at an extreme disadvantage.
 As the arrows flew over his head, he became aware of the other disadvantage of bows.
 They were dealing with a limited supply of arrows; once the arrows where all shot, they lost their main advantage.
 Rodregas heard the noise of the first soldier to rush from the road; he went low and swung hard.
 Rodregas hit knee high and the man trying to run by went flying head first into the dirt.
 Rodregas knew from the feel of the blow that his sword had hit armor and bounced off.
 It was an Immortal Guard.
 Doi’van shot another arrow almost straight down into the back of the neck of the downed guard.
 The man thrashed once and then laid still.

Then they started to pick up speed and I covered my face with my hands.
 The rain streaked through my hair, soaking it to my head.
 Seth looked extremely annoyed as he stood there, his blue hair plastered to his face.
 His eyes were half covered by his hair and his eyes locked onto mine.
 He rolled his eyes and looked away.
 Jason had his arms over his head, trying to keep the rain off his red hair but I already saw dark spots all over it where the rain had escaped his arms.
 Emily's pink hair was dry and safely under a hood.
 Wait, what?

We stood like that for a good thirty seconds before he reached a single finger up and traced the left side of my face as he leaned in slightly.
 It was simultaneously the scariest and most exciting thing I'd ever experienced.
 Even as I leaned in a little bit myself, my thundering heart seemed to be trying to leap out of my throat solely for the purpose of disrupting what looked very much like it was going to be my first kiss.
 Every tiny hair on my body stood up in a shiver of nervousness as he tilted his head to the side, and then he broke off, shaking himself slightly as he gave me a smile.
 For a second I thought he was rejecting me, that he'd decided not to kiss me because he wasn't interested.
 Only the way he reached out for my hand indicated that he really wasn't repulsed by me.
 It bothered me the entire time I was in History, and then just before I got to Physics it hit me.
 He hadn't stopped because he didn't want to kiss me.
 He stopped because with all of my blushing and near-terror it'd been obvious I wasn't ready to be kissed.
 It was the ultimate act of chivalry.

Velixar drew out his magical chest.
 He set it beside him and let it grow out to normal size.
 From within he pulled out a suit of armor stained a deep shade of black.
 He threw it to Harruq, who managed to catch it even though his mouth hung wide open.
 “The first Horde War was caused by a disciple of mine,” the man in black explained.
 “He blessed the armor of one of the leaders of the orcish clans.
 I claimed it when he fell on the battlefield.”
 Harruq examined the suit, turning it over in his hands.
 It was composed of many interwoven straps of thick leather.

“I want to train with them.”
 Qurrah nodded so absently that Harruq wondered if his brother even heard him.
 They walked in silence under the beauty of the stars.
 “Hey, Qurrah?”
 “Yes, brother?”
 “What we did…‌is it…”
 “Did you revel in the power granted to you?” Qurrah asked.

“What madness gives you such a desire?” she asked, sending forth the strongest spells she knew.
 Several lances of ice flew down the street, followed by a ball of magma.
 The ball rolled behind the lances, covering the ground in flame.
 Velixar laughed.
 A wave of his hand created a similar shield as Aurelia’s, but instead of keeping it close to his body, he shoved it forward.
 The lances shattered into shards when slammed against it.
 The ball of magma halted when touching the barrier and then reversed direction.
 The elf glared, detonating the attack with a thought.
 Molten rock covered the street, splattering across both Velixar’s and Aurelia’s shields before sliding to the dirt.
 “How long can you keep this up?” the necromancer asked.

Still the soft linen shirt of light brown, which he knew had been loose on the captain, was much more comfortable than the wizard robe he had been wearing.
 Unfortunately none of the pants would fit.
 Poir, though a large man, had skinny legs.
 Rodregas felt ridiculous wearing only a linen shirt and his coin purses as he stepped to the armory door.
 The door was built of massive slabs of iron oak.
 Rodregas reached up and pulled the emergency key from the crack at the right of the door.
 Due to his status as a senior sergeant, he knew where the key was kept.
 Once the door was open, he stepped inside.
 Immediately, his eyes went to a long side bench where several new pieces of armor were piled up.

“Where’s Seth?” Emily asked.
 I raised my head.
 “We haven’t found him yet.” Her eyes widened.
 “What do you mean, you haven’t found him yet?” “I crashed into Jazell, who was doing, like, forty,” Jason pointed to me.
 “Then we both found you fighting beasts with your fiery fingertips of death.” She raised an eyebrow.
 “Fiery fingertips of death?” “Hey,” he shrugged, “Jazell’s sarcasm is contagious.” “Anyway, we better find Seth before he gets into some serious trouble,” I said, and walked off.
 I went farther down the hill and the fighting spread out more.
 I tripped on a dead root and cursed as I stood back up.

He saw the walls of a great city smashed to pieces as men climbed over, swords high and armor shining.
 And then he saw Karak and Ashhur cross blades.
 He tore his eyes from the fire, unable to withstand the strength of the image.
 The fire shrank back to a small blaze.
 “Most men cowered at the sight of it.
 Do not be ashamed,” Velixar said.
 “There might have been a victor, but Celestia interfered at last.
 She cast each god far beyond the sky, to where she herself had made a home.
 She gave half to Ashhur and half to Karak.

“If the Night’s Circle destroys Kojas forever, why is he still here?” June backed up a bit.
 “We think that our Night’s Circle wasn’t strong enough because Mark was seriously injured.
 But no problem, you guys have to destroy him now.” She must have seen me shaking because she added, “No pressure.” “No pressure?” I practically squeaked.
 “You just put the fate of both worlds on my shoulders.” “No,” she said, “I put the fate of both worlds on all four of your shoulders.” “Alright, is that all?” I asked, eager to leave.
 June nodded and I turned to open the door.
 I was just about to turn the handle when she said, “Jazell, don’t be scared to bring out your emotions.
 They make you stronger.” I looked over my shoulder to see June standing stiffly.
 “Thanks,” I whispered.
 “Thanks June.” “Good luck, Jazell.” I opened the door and saw that Emily and Jason were also coming out of their rooms.
 Emily looked a little shaken but she gave me a thumbs-up.

The military have at their disposal scientific and technological resources which in many cases can be applied to environmental protection with the minimum of adaptation, such as information and monitoring systems that track changes in the atmosphere, in the oceans and on earth’s surface.
 These resources can be applied to environmental monitoring and impact assessment, protection of endangered species, quick response to disasters and accidents, energy conservation, and the minimization and management of waste.
 The appropriate role for the military in these various activities will depend on the country, the urgency of the circumstances, and the cost-effectiveness of military involvement compared with available alternatives.
 In some instances, it may be feasible to establish international ‘Earth corps units’, specially trained and equipped to carry out certain types of environmental protection and restoration, such as India’s eco-battalions, which seek to conserve the Himalayan habitat by restoring tree cover and constructing small dams and canals.

 The goals of peace, prosperity and fulfilment for every human being represent formidable challenges – intellectual, attitudinal, organizational and technological.
 We cannot hope to reach such lofty achievements if we waste and squander the precious and abundant resources – mental, psychological, social and material – placed at our disposal.
 A massive reduction in emphasis on weapons production and military establishments, made possible by recent political events and demanded by the pressing unmet needs of people everywhere, represents both a great opportunity and a considerable challenge.
 The opportunity is not only further to reduce the threat of war by reducing the capacity for waging war, but also to redirect and utilize for other purposes the resources now dedicated to war making and prevention.
 The challenge is to do so at a time when rising unemployment and economic stagnation in many countries make further cuts in the size of the military unpopular domestically.

 My asking you now has nothing to do with our conversation from earlier today."

 I half expected you to try and send me out of the country again.
 An invitation to the local equivalent to Prom was the last thing on my mind."
 The pair of ants disappeared, hidden among the lush grass that somehow managed not to look out of place here on the edges of the desert.
 I was starting to realize that the best way to get information out of a guy was to wait him out.
 Sometimes applying a little judicious pressure here or there helped, but it was largely just a matter of letting them work through whatever internal barriers stopped them from sharing their feelings.

I spit out the clump of wiry hair that had somehow found its way into my gasping mouth.
 I felt a searing pain as the Thrasher raked my left leg.
 I closed my eyes against the pain, trying to focus myself against the dull throb in my shin.
 Then the thrasher went limp against me.
 It was hauled off of my body and I found myself looking up into the face of a very unhappy dark blue haired boy.
 His sword was gripped tightly in his clenched fingers and a look of amusement, or many it was anger, shone on his face.
 I swallowed and collected my weapons from the ground, not daring to look at my leg.
 “Hi Seth, this is unexpected.” Seth glared at me and pulled me up.
 He was definitely angry at me.

I felt the cold water seep through my clothes and onto my skin as Seth continued to soak me.
 “Crap Jason, shut it off!” Emily hollered but it didn’t work because I heard her yell again as he sprayed her hair.
 I couldn’t see anything because my eyes were half shut and I was afraid Seth would wash my eyes out.
 “Seth seriously, stop.” You can’t command boys to do anything and to prove that, Seth shot my butt.
 Eventually they stopped, only because three water guns can hold only so much water and Emily and me looked like we could kill.
 We were both completely soaked to the bone and even though in was the middle of summer, we were shivering.
 The boys looked completely satisfied with how we looked.
 After Emily and I gave them a look, they tore down the street and disappeared.
 Emily squeezed the bottom of her shirt, “I hate them so much right now.” Water gushed onto the street.
 I wrung my hair out.

But he didn’t.
 Eric told him not to, I would learn the next day.
 Eric, whom no one recalled having done a single mean act, or said a single mean word, had told Kenny to leave us behind.
 When Kenny asked him to explain, he only insisted he didn’t want Billy or me along.
 He wouldn’t say why.
 That night on Viejas grade, Mike was driving when they swerved off the road and careened down an embankment.
 On account of some miracle or quirk of physics, the little car didn’t roll, only slammed down on a wide ledge in the mountainside.
 Eric was riding shotgun, where I might've been, since I was taller and longer-legged than any of the others except Mike Beatty, who was driving.
 In those days nobody wore seatbelts.

Velixar laughed as they pierced into his stomach and chest.
 No blood ran from them.
 “You must do far better than that,” he said, his fingers hooked in strange positions.
 Another blast of dark power washed over Dieredon.
 He felt his right shoulder crack into fragments.
 Darkness swam before his eyes, darkness dominated by twin red orbs.
 The elf reached into a small pocket of his armor and drew out a glass vial.
 “Healing potions will not aid you,” Velixar mocked.
 “This is no healing potion,” Dieredon said.
 He threw the vial.

Ravenhurr loved to boast that the tube brought the stars closer to him.
 He was never one to hurry about anything, at least not before tonight.
 At that moment, though, his lean body quivered with excitement.
 “Master," Rodregas said, with a respectful bow, "The prisoners are ready.” Ravenhurr looked up.
 His eyes passed over Rodregas to glance at the prisoners.
 He nodded without a word and went back to peering through the tube.
 Rodregas had never understood how the stars in the night sky could make the world closer or farther away from the Celestial Realm, where the Gods lived, or how that could affect magic, but he knew the placement of the stars was critical to the success of the ceremony tonight.
 Ravenhurr was an attractive man, like most of the Immortalist Sorcerers.

Alec nodded as I looked back and met his eyes.
 "They were pretty close.
 There weren't that many of them, but they could've decided to push the issue regardless."
 I spent the rest of the trip, expecting someone to jump out of the trees, but faster than I'd have believed possible, the wrought iron gates I'd noticed on our trip out last night were swinging open, and we were turning off onto Alec's asphalt lane.
 A distinguished-looking gentleman in his fifties was waiting for us as we screeched to a stop.
 His slightly disapproving frown hinted at decades of practice letting his 'bosses' know when they'd just crossed some kind of line, all the while never crossing any himself.
 The shape shifters all exited the car, most before it had even stopped moving, and then Jessica and Dominic both appeared as I made my comparatively slow way out of the vehicle.

 Brandon shook his head as we pulled to a stop in front of my house.
 "No, that means I can do something about you losing your ride."
 I suddenly felt like there was a joke I was missing out on.

I had a small desk to the left of my bed that was piled up high with homework and random drawings.
 I threw my bag on my bed and took off my shoes.
 Then I headed back down stairs to help set the table.

 I set a plate down in front of my Dad.
 He frowned and pointed to my scratched shin.
 “What happened?” He asked, and studied my leg.
 “I tripped on a crack and scraped my leg.” I said flatly, the lie rolling off my tongue easily.

 I stood there woodenly for several seconds, unsure whether or not she was through.
 She finally made a shooing motion and turned back to grading papers.
 Predictably, there were still a half-dozen other kids in the classroom.
 They all turned back to the door and started filing out again, but by tomorrow half the school would know exactly how badly I'd just been humiliated.
 I found myself just outside the tutor lab with no recollection of having stumbled to my locker, or going by Physics to grab the stuff I'd left there.
 Still, somehow my Spanish book had disappeared, replaced by my math book.
 My knees started shaking as I entered the room, but I made it safely to my normal table before they gave out.

Their sparring ended, Harruq and Aurelia sat side-by-side against a tree, both glistening with sweat.
 “Getting better,” the half-orc said.

 “Don’t worry,” she said, patting his hand.

These lessons were intense and stressful.
 I’d been unable to generate magic on demand so he’d started lunging at me with weapons, sticks, fire, forcing me to respond to protect myself.
 After each attack, he would come right back at me and if I tried to repeat a tactic for defense, he would overpower my magic and push me to find a new maneuver.
 I was beat, winded, drained.
 “Mount up,” he announced.
 When I started to climb on my horse, the horse shot off like an arrow, almost knocking me to the ground.
 I glared at Chevelle’s back, but he was already galloping away.
 I reached out with magic, drawing Steed’s head around to press him back to me, climbed up, and clicked my heels hard to catch Chevelle.
 He was riding too fast again and I was not looking forward to the day, sure it would be worse than the already miserable morning.
 I rode up beside him, planning a snide remark about the trick, but was distracted by a black stone in his hand.

Art – What for?
 It happened several years ago.
 Karen –I didn’t mean to drudge up old pain.
 Art - Ah, it still does hurt a little.
 It’s not often that your wife of fifteen years tells you that she hates you and you’re going to hell, and the on top of that goes to become a Nun.
 Karen – I shouldn’t have been so nosey.
 Art – Bah, it’s ok, I enjoy talking to you, besides it could have been worse.
 Karen – How could have it gotten worse than that?
 Art – She could have told me that I was evil incarnate and that I turned her into a lesbian.

I’d spent the last two days with him, but he hadn’t revealed anything of himself and that had only made me more curious.
 I retrieved the documents I’d hidden after my second trip to the library to find out whether they added anything to the report from the Council’s record-keeper.
 There wasn’t much new there, mostly more names, but I did notice a watermark on one of the pages.
 I held it up to the light to better see.
 It was a Council marking and something else.
 I dug out the first pages from under my mattress and examined them closer.
 The pages directly from the record-keeper’s report all included the same Council mark plus a string of characters.
 Trying to decode them, I realized one of the symbols might simply be a page number.
 And the others, they were probably locators.
 I felt like a fool.

After deciding in my favor, he said, “There’s a big change coming.

The nickname should have hurt, but somehow it wasn't as bad when the pack used it.
 It was almost like having a new family, one without all of the grief-poisoned memories that popped up every time I really thought about Dad or Cindi.
 Faster than I would've believed possible, we were all in our dresses, and waiting in the living room for the boys to make their appearance.
 Jasmin and Rachel had worked what I was pretty sure was actual magic.
 Even Jessica was nothing less than stunning, and I didn't look as bad as normal.
 Jasmin's backless black dress and shoulder-length gloves had streaks of blue that brought out her eyes, while Dominic's tight, red gown seemed to give her the confidence and poise you'd expect from someone so gorgeous and utterly exotic.
 Jess had opted for a sleeveless silver number that flared out at the bottom so much I wasn't sure how Isaac would be able to walk next to her without stepping on the shimmery material.
 Rachel's mauve dress was probably the most conservative of all, neither over-snug, nor especially low-cut.
 It had seemed entirely out of character considering what she'd purchased for the rest of us, but when I'd asked, she'd just grimaced and said Alec would've made her stay home if she'd chosen anything more daring.
 None of which helped me feel any more comfortable in the tight, strapless wonder Rachel had been so excited to give me.

“Depends.”
 We were facing each other once more, ready to begin another round.
 “Want to try a weapon?” I was pretty sure I didn’t, give how much the weaponless training hurt.

 “Why use arrows if you have magic?” She had that ‘Frey, you’re an idiot’ look again.
 “Magic uses more energy the farther away you try to focus it.

The other half of the time I had a hard time believing it'd really happened.
 But it had, and there were more than four dozen roses scattered around our kitchen to prove it.
 Predictably, Brandon didn't do anything halfway.
 I'd gone to school on Tuesday after receiving his amazing, 'anonymous' gift the day before, only to be ambushed at lunch.
 I'd been anxiously waiting for him at his normal table when a pair of employees from the local florist had walked in, their arms overflowing with roses.
 I'd been expecting them to stop in front of Jasmin.
 Instead they'd passed her up and then declined to make a beeline to Cassie either.
 When they'd started handing the flowers to me, I'd tried to convince them there'd been some kind of mistake.
 The sound of 'One Day More' playing on the cell phone nestled in the closest bouquet had been what finally convinced me it was all meant for me.
 Brandon's voice had been like silk caressing my face when I'd answered the phone.

 “And what is that, Qurrah?

 The fire sparked a shower of orange into the sky as Qurrah spoke.
 “Superior.”
 In the distance, elven eyes watched that cough of flame stretch to the stars, as well as the sight of those two huddled figures talking long through the night.

The horses had been acting up and Rodregas hoped that with the energy smoothing out, the horses would stop fighting their lines.
 Though in truth the horses seemed to be getting more agitated.
 As the magic smoothed out Rodregas smiled and said, “The ley line would be as much of a problem as a help unless, of course, the farmhouse is made of Nymph stone.” Rodregas expected the sound of pleased surprise but instead heard alarmed in-drawn breaths from them both; he saw that they were looking to the right, where he suddenly noticed movement.
 Two female Dire Cats stepped out of the orchard and made their way to the farmhouse.
 They had a relaxed, bored look.
 He thought that they gave him a casual nod, but he could not actually see any movement.
 Rodregas simply knew that these were the two Dire Cats that he had freed from the Dungeon.
 “Did everyone from that dungeon follow me?” he whispered to himself.
 The three stood there fighting to keep the horses from running and watched as the Dire Cats stepped through the main door for a moment, but left after only a short wait.
 The Dire Cats then circled the main building and went over to the far edge of the main house and then simply disappeared.

"Was Jasmin dominant then?
 I mean if she was a royal wolf and you hadn't manifested your hybrid form yet did she win all of the fights?"
 Alec rested his cheek on the top of my head.
 "Not exactly.
 If she'd been a little more heartless she probably could have killed me and cowed the rest of the pack.
 Even then though, it was becoming pretty clear that we couldn't have two separate packs in such close proximity.
 The need to keep the pack strong meant that even though she pretty much ran the show most of the time there was the occasional thing that I'd just refuse to back down on."
 His muscles tightened unconsciously, like maybe he was remembering past pains.
 "She'd rip me up one side and down the other but on the most important stuff I'd simply out stubborn her.
 When the dust settled usually I at least got a compromise we could both live with."

 She looked at his arms with concern.

 "Tell me where it is, and I'll get it for you."
 Following his instructions, she went to his bathroom and got the lotion.

He told her that all 50 states--"Fifty!"
 she exclaimed--had Miss America representatives in a contest that was televised every year, along with a Miss Universe contest, and that evolution was taught in most schools now, alongside creation in some parts of the country.
 She told him that she'd always wanted to see Josephine Baker's stage show and Louis Armstrong and his trumpet, and he told her that anyone truly talented and/or popular now eventually did a television special.
 She told him about the excitement over the discovery of King Tut's tomb in 1922, and as she was explaining how it had inspired the Egyptian motif of her dress, she glanced around and realized how out of style she was.
 "Dresses are sometimes quite short," she observed, "but not all of them.
 And I never would have believed that women would wear trousers in public without causing a stir!"
 "You should see the bathing suits."
 "They're shorter than the dresses?"
 He laughed.

He looked for a key but there was nothing.
 He guessed that it was locked by magic and required a magic word or incantation to open the lock.
 He pushed and pulled on the door, but it was solidly made and there was nothing to get a good hold of to test his new strength.
 He looked around for something to use as a pry bar; next to the fireplace was a poker.
 He grabbed it and forced it into the crack were a normal door would have its catch.
 He got it wedged in good but then stopped and went over to the outside door and opening it, listened for anyone nearby before going back inside the room.
 He carefully closed the door behind him; the sound of him breaking down the study door would ring loud in the predawn silence, but his need for money was too great.
 What he had found would be worth some good coin but finding a trader that would give him its worth would take time.
 He needed to find silver and gold.
 Rodregas muffled the door with a blanket the best he could and then with a violent shove and twist of the fireplace poker, shattered open the study door.

“How amusingly wrong.”
 Harruq had anticipated watching the fight over the wall from the roof, but instead they turned and watched the orcs slam into the human forces that surrounded the opening.
 The first push was brutal.
 Screams of pain and the sound of clashing of metal on metal flowed into the city.
 Harruq watched an orc wielding two swords cut off the arm of one soldier, and, as the blood from the limb splattered across his face, he turned and decapitated another with two vicious hacks.
 The orc roared in victory only to die as a soldier shoved his sword in his side and out his back.
 “Will they make it through?” Harruq asked, in awe of the display.
 Qurrah glanced over the wall and then back to the main combat.
 Archers continued eviscerating the orc forces.
 If they could push into the city, their arrows would be a nuisance at best, but it seemed they had underestimated the human soldiers.

But whatever the method, it is essential that this effort be combined with simultaneous implementation of other essential policies.
 3.Eliminate crop losses: In Russia and the other republics of the former USSR, highest priority in agriculture must be given to efforts that will increase the availability of food and reduce the huge crop losses and massive food imports.
 These losses vary by crop and region but average between 25 and 50 per cent of total field production for major crops.
 A reduction in crop losses could completely eliminate millions of tons of grain imports.
 The reasons for such enormous losses include poor quality of seeds and planting material, the lack of sufficient local storage capacity, in efficient and inappropriate equipment for planting, harvesting, storage and processing, poorly motivated farm workers and short age of labour at harvest time.
 Demonstration projects have proved that potato losses can be reduced from 35 per cent to under 5 per cent in one year.
 A viable solution requires concerted and coordinated activity by government, industry and agriculture at a time when each is operating in isolation from the others.
 The main elements of a viable plan to reduce losses for foodgrains, vegetables and potatoes have been proposed by a Dutch cooperative agri-business firm.
 The aim of the plan is to reduce food imports to zero and eliminate food shortages within three to five years.
 The plan requires acquisition of foreign production and storage technology, but depends only marginally on import of equipment, most of which can be manufactured in domestic defence facilities.

“Because I need to know.”
 The half-orc nodded.
 He began his story.
 “The only money I ever made was working for the king,” Harruq said.
 “This was after the orcs attacked Veldaren about a year ago and busted up the walls.
 They were hiring everybody to help rebuild and I was just as strong then as I am now.
 They weren’t paying much, but you got to remember we were stealing food to live.
 Those few coins they gave me were a treasure.

 Their sparring ended, Harruq and Aurelia sat side-by-side against a tree, both glistening with sweat.
 “Getting better,” the half-orc said.
 “You’re going to be beating my ass in a few weeks if you keep learning as fast as you are.”
 “Don’t worry,” she said, patting his hand.
 “Your ass is safe with me.”
 Harruq laughed at the absurdity.

As Adjam, the elder of the brothers, descended from the heavens and touched down upon the Earth, he collapsed to the ground in pain.
 Despite his agony as the very bones of his body rearranged themselves, he managed to call out a warning to Inock, to flee back to the Moon.
 The love of Inock for Adjam was so great that he rushed to his brother's side, where he too fell victim to the Earth's plague."
 I wanted so very badly to remain awake, but wrapped comfortably in the warmth of Alec's arms, I couldn't fight off exhaustion any longer, and I felt myself drift off into dreams of two brothers who survived the plague, rising from the ground after seven days, one a wolf, the other a jaguar.
 Chapter 24 I'd been awake for several minutes before I finally remembered where I was.
 I rolled over, opened my eyes, groaning when I saw that the other side of the bed was empty.
 Who knew what Alec thought.
 He'd obviously fled his own room to avoid talking to me when I finally woke up.
 Donovan's gentle knock and appearance at the door pulled me up short before I could really get going on the self-loathing.

Qurrah leaned forward, clutching at his tormenter’s shaking hands.
 Words spilled from the half-orc’s mouth, garbled and nearly unintelligible.
 “What is it you wish to say to me?” the elf asked, ignoring the flailing hands that pawed at his face.
 “ _Hemorrhage,_ ” the half-orc hissed.
 The elf’s face exploded.
 Qurrah fell over onto his side, breathing as slowly as he could through the blood that filled his throat.
 The dead body of the elf crumpled in front of him, all of his hate-filled features gone from his face except for a single eye.
 The half-orc stared, wondering if his brother was truly dead.
 Darkness crept at the corner of his sight.
 His strength was fading fast, and he had little doubt that if he passed out he would never wake.

12.The UN should create its own international surveillance system, including its own satellites, to monitor and report on potential trouble spots and troop movements.
 It should also develop its own appropriate and effective logistics units.
 Criteria to allow UN fact-finding missions in respect of intra-state conflict should be negotiated and codified by the General Assembly.
 At the same time, the UN should integrate fact-finding into enforcement action taken under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.
 A UN Staff College should be established to develop and maintain administrative procedures for governing UN peace-keeping, peace-making and peace-enforcing operations and to train an effective corps of personnel for these purposes.
 Utilization of Defence Resources for Development and the Environment
 1.The concept of 'peace dividend' should be expanded to include manpower, educational and training capabilities, scientific and technological resources, production facilities, land and abandoned military bases that can be redeployed to combat rural and urban poverty as well as national and global environmental degradation.
 An inventory of these resources should be compiled and efforts made to identify alternative uses through the UN's specialized agencies and by national governments.
 All nations should advise the Secretary General of the human, technological and produc tive resources they are willing and able to place at the disposal of the UN.
 2.Each government should draw up an inventory of its military manpower, science, technology and other facilities which could be used to sustain the natural resource base, prevent environmental degradation and cooperate with other countries in combating regional and global threats to environmental security.

Not wanting to out-and-out lie, I ducked into the nearest restroom.
 It was empty except for a mousy brunette I'd only seen a couple of times before.
 I smiled and started to open my mouth to say hi, but thought better of it.
 This was Sanctuary.
 She wasn't going to acknowledge the new girl was even breathing, let alone sentient.
 It should have bothered me, but I just shrugged it off and went to the far stall.
 A split second after I'd closed the door I heard the heavy wooden outer door open.
 Normally that wouldn't have caused me to even pause in my normal routine, but it suddenly felt as if the stall was too small.

 She’s a girl, the doctor said, and I reasoned a girl might be quieter, a little more gentle than a boy.
 Knowing her sex made her more real.
 For the first time, I started getting pictures.
 I saw her as thin, pale skinned and strong like her mom, with reddish hair of a peculiar henna-like tint.
 Her eyes were bright and inquisitive, her mouth ever-ready to speak.

Qurrah chuckled though it felt like hammers pummeled his chest.
 He spread his hands to either side and bathed a few houses with fire.
 The city’s fear was deep enough he could sense it like a cold breeze, and he wanted it to deepen.
 An arrow whistled by, clipping his ear.
 Qurrah dropped to his knees as a second thudded into the side of a home, inches from his neck.
 A spell on his lips, he spun, grabbing chunks of dirt in his hands to use as components for a spell.
 From two windows, a pair of elves held bows, and together they pulled back the strings and released their arrows.
 The ground beneath Qurrah cracked and tore as his spell completed, so that he fell into a deep pit.
 The landing jarred his back, and he gasped for air, but for the moment he was safe from the arrows that went flying above.
 The fire continued to spread.

The idea that most of these jobs could be created in the corporate sector or by government-sponsored activities has been put to rest.
 Currently, there are nearly one billion self-employed and unpaid family workers in the world, most of them self-employed farmers in developing countries.
 The self-employed represent 48 per cent of the workforce in low-income economies (less than $500 per capita GDP).
 For any strategy to be successful, it must give central importance to self-employment and entrepreneurship, with emphasis on agriculture, agro-industry and small firms in the informal sector.
 While a single approach will not be applicable to countries and regions of the world in different stages of development, a number of common principles and strategies are widely applicable.
 Agriculture as an engine
 Slightly more than half the world’s workforce, of whom 30 per cent are women, are still engaged in agriculture.
 Agriculture will remain the largest single occupation for the foreseeable future.
 For too long this sector has been regarded by planners primarily as the source of essential food production.
 Historically, agriculture has also played a major role as an engine for economic growth and employment.

Trends and Prospects
 ICPF refused to side with the pessimists who viewed unemployment as a terminal illness spreading rapidly through the entire world economic system.
 Its report presented evidence to dispel the twin myths that technological development and trade were net job destroyers.
 It traced the growth of employment opportunities through the 20th Century, a century of unprecedented technological development and commercial expansion, to show that this period has also been an era of unprecedented growth in the quantity and quality of employment opportunities.
 The report argued that the current surge in joblessness was a temporary result of the mismatch between the rates of surging population growth and expanding economic activity.
 It concurred that rising levels of unemployment constituted a serious problem that needed to be urgently addressed, but rejected the notion that it is an inevitable and incurable disease which the world must resign itself to passively suffer and endure.
 The Commission, therefore, developed and presented a comprehensive strategy for job-led economic growth.
 Over the past decade, changes in the employment picture lend credence to ICPF’s perspective.
 The American economy experienced a decade-long expansion, fuelling high levels of employment at home, while stimulating job growth throughout East Asia, attracting a massive influx of foreign technical workers and setting the stage for a global outsourcing boom which is still in its infancy.
 Among the advanced economies, unemployment declined from an average of 6.9 per cent in the period 1985-94 to 6.5 per cent during the last 10 years.

“You think Kojas sent them?” I mumbled to him and pushed a branch away.
 He looked at me from the corner of his eye.
 “Obviously, why else would they say that the 'King' would underestimate them?” “You make a good point,” I said.
 “Why did the syphon attack you?” I lowered my voice so only he could hear me.
 “I thought you said they wouldn't attack you.” He looked uneasy.
 “The syphon said he would be rewarded for grabbing me.
 I think he wasn't trying to kill me but trying to knock me out.” “So he could bring you to Kojas.” He nodded but he seemed somewhere else.
 He sighed and said, “I hope they won't go too far to achieve that, or it'll get harder to hide this from Emily and Jason.” I crossed my arms.
 “I told you that we should tell them.
 But you still refuse to let me-” “No,” he said sternly.

Still, the transforming expression made me realize just how badly I'd missed his other face, the one that wasn't stern and serious all of the time.
 "No, you're not bothering me in the slightest.
 Jasmin or Isaac either one could easily keep watch.
 Our sense of smell and hearing are good enough that it's all but impossible for even other wolves to catch us unawares.
 They're here more in the role of bodyguards.
 If Brandon's people do show up, it'll likely take all three of us to get you away safely."
 "So you don't mind?
 You'll stay here and talk to me?"
 Alec paused for several seconds, which wasn't promising.
 Then again, he hadn't released my shoulders yet, so maybe there was still some hope.

I was taken aback with his sudden intensity, and part of me wanted to bristle at the implication I couldn't be trusted with a secret.
 His expression softened a little as he reached into the small bag mounted on the fuel tank, and handed me a bottle of water.
 I hadn't even realized I was thirsty until that second.
 "I'm sorry, Adriana.
 I know I can depend on you, this is just important enough that I needed to make sure you understood what's riding on your discretion."
 I finished with the first third of the bottle, and then nodded.
 "I won't say anything.

 "Not a what, but a who."

That is what this meditation was all about, so what was his duty now?
 Killing Immortalists was not something that he, or even the three of them together, could just start doing.
 The problem was not just the individual Immortalist; many an angry town would have killed the local Immortalist Sorcerer after having their people taken.
 Anyone that struck back at an individual Immortalist would face the wrath of the Guild of the Celestial Path, which included not just the god-like power of the Guild Master and his various sorcerers, but also the army of the Guild known as The Immortal Guards.
 While not a large army, they were the most feared warriors in the world.
 The leader of The Immortal Guards was called the Commander General, and Rodregas knew of his deeds and background though he had never met him.
 General Rigoria had once been the Grand Marshal of the same Knightly Order that had trained Rodregas.
 The Order was unique in that it trained not just in the various martial arts but also in the magical, and recruited those who had magical power, but lacked the temperament or intelligence to be a sorcerer.
 Instead of working toward the power of sorcery, they underwent the Sigil ceremony, gaining a magical enhancement but losing the versatility of a true mage.
 Gaining such sigils was outlawed by the guide except for their own warriors, but the Order of the Soaring Heavens was also the traditional sources for the Gods own Paladins, and even the Celestial Guild had never dared to anger the gods by interfering with their use of sigils.

He was being hunted; but hunted because he had finally dealt out justice.
 He had killed two monsters, two who wore faces not their own, and who he could feel no remorse for killing.
 Rodregas had finally escaped to his quiet place in the mountains to rest and, best of all, with two companions who seemed to be good people.
 Clearly, Doi’van had a dark side and he knew little of either of his companions.
 But it had been a long time since he had wanted to know more about anyone that he met.
 Rodregas had a new strong and powerful body, and he owed a great debt of guilt for that.
 He had even been able to free prisoners and give them a second chance at life.
 How many times had he dreamed of that while the prisoners had pleaded with him?
 He had turned a stone face to the prisoners; he had refused to learn their names, and had just survived by doing his duty.

I realized I had stopped breathing as I read, so engrossed in the story.
 I reached up absentmindedly to stroke the tops of my ears.

 I took a steadying breath and spat out, “No.” They stared at me, incredulous.

 I would later realize that she fed us first because she was so broke she couldn’t afford to feed herself.
 In all the years after the divorce, she had never received a dime in child support from my biological father, Richard.
 There were times at this house when my mother would have us hide in the closet with her.
 This would happen when the rent was past due.
 She would make a game out of it but you could see the fear in her eyes, as this was no game.

 Apparently she's a lot tougher than a normal wolf should be, and she's just crazy enough to fight to the death over something that the other two don't think is really all that important.
 Jessica is pretty much the most submissive, not by temperament, but because she's the weakest fighter we've got."

 Harruq arrived at the clearing the next morning at the same time as always.
 Aurelia stepped out from behind a tree, her cold, emotionless face so different from the previous day.
 “We have sparred our two weeks, Harruq,” she said.
 “You have no need to come here.”
 “Yeah, well, you heard what I said yesterday,” Harruq said, his face red.

We walked in comfortable silence for several minutes before turning off into what I could only assume was the Lilac Room.
 Donovan looked up as we entered the suite.
 "I trust your mother was well, sir?"
 Alec nodded, a short choppy motion that eloquently conveyed his desire not to discuss the matter.
 He turned towards me, only to break off as a cell phone rang.
 "It's for you, probably your mom.
 Pretend you're home, I'll explain once you're finished."
 I almost dropped the phone, and probably wouldn't have managed to figure out how to answer the call in time if he hadn't reached over and pushed the green button for me.

A large proportion of these demobilized people have already joined, or will soon join, the forces of the unemployed.
 Some may be tempted to market their military skills elsewhere.
 Just as the present efforts of the UN to make and keep the peace are severely constrained by the lack of a standing professional military force under its own direction, so also the prodigious efforts of the UN’s development agencies to accelerate development among member countries is hampered by a lack of well-trained, disciplined and highly organized personnel for implementation, especially in those countries with the greatest need of assistance.
 The Commission recommends that, as a complement to the establishment of an International Force for Peace, an International Force for Development be constituted, comprised of former military personnel who, after appropriate training, will work to accelerate economic development to provide food, health, literacy and jobs for all.
 A UN Peace Force and UN Development Force, functioning under a democratically restructured UN, can make a lasting contribution to achieving the major goals of the UN system.
 Conclusion
 Seven years ago the threat of nuclear war between the superpowers loomed large in the minds of people everywhere.
 The euphoria generated by the end of the Cold War led to high expectations of peace and a ‘peace dividend’ the world over.
 Yet excitement soon turned to disappointment as the full anticipated results of these magnificent accomplishments did not immediately materialize.
 Then, as attention turned to more mundane problems closer to home, the sense of relief and celebration was replaced by growing concern over the increasing prominence of other threats to international security: some of these were aggravated by the new positive developments, while others had not previously seemed so serious by comparison with the threat of nuclear annihilation.

But until our sport came into season and we officially made the teams, we got denied privileges afforded to athletes, like assigned gym lockers.
 Since Eric still wanted to work out and wouldn’t face the world without a shower afterward, Cliff invited him to share his locker.
 Besides running the mile during track season, Cliff was second man on the cross-country team, behind Gary Hafner.
 Eric used the locker for a couple weeks before Coach Gory summoned Cliff to his office, sat him down, and asked him to explain why a new sweat suit just issued to Gary Hafner had turned up missing and gotten found in Cliff’s locker.
 Cliff maintained that he’d never even seen the sweat suit.
 “It looks like Eric stole them,” Coach said.
 “Eric doesn’t steal,” Cliff said adamantly.
 Still, when Coach Gory dropped Cliff from the cross-country and track teams, he got afflicted with anger and confusion, wondering if Eric might’ve been the thief after all.
 For a week or so, he seethed and Eric brooded, ashamed even that Cliff would suspect him.
 They passed each other in the halls without a greeting.

The single most important factor behind rising numbers of unemployed persons and increasing absolute numbers of families below the poverty line in developing countries has been the 2.4-fold expansion of population in the Third World, and more than doubling of the economically active population since 1950, which have resulted in a 4 per cent decline in the overall employment rate.
 Population growth rates continue to fall steadily in most countries, with the exception of Africa, providing an opportu nity for economic growth and job growth to catch up with the population explosion of recent decades.
 Along with rapid quantitative job growth, the global economy has achieved dramatic qualitative gains in the nature of employment.
 During recent decades, there has also been a marked movement away from subsistence level manual occupations, primarily in agriculture, to more skilled and remunerative forms of employment.
 Worldwide, the percentage of the work force engaged in agriculture has fallen by 24 per cent since 1950, from 67 to 51 per cent.
 Unemployment is of growing concern today primarily because population has expanded in recent decades even faster than job creation and because a larger percentage of the population, principally women, seek employment now than at any time in the past.
 The shortages of jobs and the resulting poverty represent the most pressing social problem in the world today.
 But viewed in historical perspective, it is clear that substantial progress has been made during the post-war period, making humanity as a whole more prosperous than at any previous period in recorded history.
 Over the past five decades, global GDP has multiplied seven-fold.
 In spite of unprecedented population growth, per capita income has more than tripled.

“We need to hurry, though.”
 He looped his arm through Qurrah’s and then hurried down the alley.
 As a soldier’s body collapsed at the end, the two stopped, and Harruq swore.
 “The orcs made it through,” he said, to which Qurrah nodded.
 “This could be bad.”
 An orc stepped into the alley, blood splashed across his gray skin.
 He held a sword in each hand, dripping gore coating both.
 Shouting something in a guttural language neither understood, the orc charged.
 “Get back,” Harruq ordered as he shoved Qurrah to one side.

Now, during and since my trip north, I often see people more clearly.
 I'm better at seeing God in the sorrow of a destitute fellow, one of those folks Hank Williams called "men with broken hearts", or in the patient nod of a sales clerk as I decide whether to buy a magazine, or in a woman's kind smile.
 When I need a break from work or chores, and sometimes while reading or praying, I sit on the back porch like my mom used to do.
 The view was the reason she gave for not selling the house after I left home.
 As I sit and gaze toward the Mexican border, I think of Eric, and how we used to peer through twilight and try to locate his home in the valley about five miles closer to Mexico.
 Which reminds me of Sylvia and how the cruelty of the world drove her crazy, and I wonder if turning to Jesus might have cured her, if she had let him expel her bitterness.
 Because for those who fail to discover peace and even joy in the midst of the cruelty, going mad is only sensible.
 I imagine Eric sitting beside me, wearing the same face as after he pinned me to his living room floor, just before he coached me to believe in myself no matter the evidence that I was a loser.
 Then the expression changes to the one I imagine him wearing when he told Kenny they needed to leave for the desert without Billy and me.
 I get a crazy idea I have never considered before.

The deal was done and I was so relieved that it was over.
 I then called my wife who was so wound up from the lack of communication over such a long period of time.
 She sobbed uncontrollably as I told her I was unharmed, headed home, the ordeal was over and we busted the drug dealers.
 A hero’s welcome awaited me, as my son was so thankful for what I had done for him.
 As I went to bed that night, my mind would not shut off and the events of that evening replayed in my head over and over again.
 I lay awake for hours wondering what would have happened if the dealer hadn’t run into the cops.
 They both confessed to the drug deal when separately interrogated.
 The officer said they had less than half of the money, which she had attempted to hide in a trash can in the Starbucks’ bathroom, and Steve had a gun, which Ashley admitted they would have used if I didn’t give them the drugs once I discovered they were short on cash.
 They were going to rob me at gunpoint!

The industry's global exports are $250 billion a year, of which Asian countries command 40 per cent.
 Trade in clothing is expected to rise by 60 per cent and textiles by 34 per cent over the next ten years.
 As labour costs have risen in East Asia, greater opportunities are emerging for lower-wage developing countries to take a larger share in growing international markets.
 In order to take advantage of the increasing opportunities opened up by liberalization of world trade, developing countries should accelerate steps to expand export-oriented markets by forging foreign collaborations and overseas subsidiaries, acquiring technology, creating an attractive commercial environment for foreign investment, and continuously building the skills of the labour force.
 7.Innovate organizationally: Significant improvements in the competitiveness and growth of businesses in developing countries can be achieved through raising organizational efficiency and dynamism through better internal management practices and better commercial systems in the marketplace.
 Conduct a comprehensive study of successful management practices, systems and institutions from both developing and developed countries that can be transferred and adapted to local conditions in or der to accelerate development in each field of activity.
 Evolve new organizational patterns for existing industries based on adaptation of new technologies in small, geographically decentralized, labour-intensive production units in order to make these industries more responsive, flexible, efficient and competitive.
 8.Extend basic education: A distinguishing feature of the East Asian countries has been their emphasis during the early stage of industrialization on primary and secondary education, especially in rural areas.
 This strategy increases the productivity of the mass of the workforce, helps promote income equality, consumer spending power and broad support for high growth and pro-business policies.
 Raise the educational qualifications of the workforce to the level pertaining in more economically advanced nations.

Rodregas had always thought that it was only Ravenhurr’s eyes that gave away the fact that what was inside him was not as attractive as his exterior.
 Ravenhurr’s eyes had an intensity about them, a habit of weighing everyone else and finding them wanting.
 Rodregas felt that Ravenhurr saw in everyone else a lesser person whose best function was to be used by his betters.
 Rodregas looked over the rooftop following Ravenhurr’s eyes.
 Most of the open flat roof of the tower was covered in various circles.
 The largest circle held all the others and was made of a glittering white sand-like substance.
 Its diameter had been drawn as large as possible within the limitations of the roof’s edges.
 On the inside were sigils, runes, and small candles set out every few feet.
 Rodregas knew enough of magic to understand that the purpose of this circle was to keep out unwanted magical influences.

We never knew when we were going to get knocked across the room.
 We were often treated like unwanted animals.
 We wondered why this was happening to us but at the same time we wondered if the same thing was happening in the families across the street.
 Our half-brother, Harry (named after Dino’s father) was soon born.
 Then, my stepfather had even less regard for us as we were now second-class citizens to his “real” son.
 My mother was also abused.
 She stayed, as so many abused women do, because her only options would only lead us back to poverty and uncertainty, and also because Dino threatened to take my little brother to Greece where she would never see him again.
 She protected us and herself as best as she could and she likely hoped for better days.

Rodregas glanced at the other two.
 Doi’van met his inquiring look, but did not respond.
 Imeralda was huddled behind Doi’van’s great bulk.
 For a moment Rodregas thought she was hiding from fear of the great sorcerer.
 Then he saw she was actually reading one of the Grimoires that she must have had with her.
 Her fingers were making patterns in the air.
 She was too busy to look up at Rodregas, but he almost smiled.
 He had no idea what she was trying to do, but at least they had something to try.
 He needed to keep Van’dret busy to give Imeralda time to do whatever magic she was going to cast.
 Rodregas turned to Van’dret and said, “Well, since you are killing us today, how about we make things interesting for both sides?

“Apologies.
 I will try to avoid touching you.” “It’s fine, really,” I said, though I didn’t understand.
 It was like a static charge.
 Meanwhile, I had decided the thickness was a drawl.
 “I don’t know your accent.
 Where is it from?” “North Camber,” he replied.
 A snicker slipped from Steed and Anvil glanced at him before amending, “Well, that is where they cut out part of my tongue.” I recoiled, wrenching my hand from his.
 The tingle remained.
 He didn’t seem offended; he simply took a few steps backward to start his demonstration.

I hid myself behind a patch of brush to watch him.
 He had a lovely complexion with a hint of bronze and cropped dark brown hair with a few tiny streaks of blond just around his face.
 He looked less like the others I had been watching.
 He was built like the elves, strong and muscled, but still lean.
 He wore plain pants and tall boots.
 His light cloth shirt moved around him as he walked, unlaced at the chest.
 He carried a small blade in his hand, but I couldn’t imagine what he was doing here unaccompanied.
 There was a rustle from the brush several yards in the opposite direction I was hiding.
 He rushed toward it and I followed, unsure why he was running.
 The noise was made by a small boar and the human was chasing it.

 Alec gazed at me for several seconds, and then sighed.

He stepped up close looking up at the beast; he was massive!
 The beast’s mouth was open, not as if he was going to roar, but simply in relaxed pose.
 He looked like he had been caught stalking forward on the hunt.
 Rodregas stepped up and just stared at him.
 He was beautiful.
 “Don’t touch,” barked Doi’van.
 Rodregas nodded, he knew not to touch, but then realized that his hand was raised and had been reaching out to stroke the lion’s mane.
 He knew that this was the greater sigil that he wanted to gain.
 It was in a perfect circle.
 He had taken in the essence of the Celestial Lion back at Raven Keep, and now Rodregas would consume his own magical power with the greater sigil of a Celestial Lion and become a perfect vessel for its power.

My knees were weak, but I had to get out now.
 For all that I hated Cassie, there was no way this crazy chick would act on her threats when there were three of us to corroborate each other's stories.
 I quietly swung the stall door open and felt my eyes go wide as I saw Lucy curled up, sobbing, at Jasmin's feet.
 Neither of the other girls even bothered to look at me as I carefully moved to the door.
 Jasmin took half a step to the side, giving me room to get around her, but there wasn't even a slight drop in the level of menace she was radiating.
 It was like I didn't even exist.
 I was still shaking on my way down the hall.
 By the time I made it into Algebra, I thought I was going to throw up.

"It's my pleasure to read off the names of the five winners in our drawing for tickets to Les Misérables."
 "The first winner is Pam White."
 Somewhere down the hall I heard someone yell, and then an entire class broke out into cheers.
 I knew I should be happy for Pam, but I was too busy wishing everyone would quiet down so we could hear the next name.
 Mrs. Alexander shut the door, muting the roar as Principal Gossil continued with a slight rustle of papers.
 "Also winning a ticket to Les Misérables next weekend, Mr. Andrew Webbs."
 A couple of half-hearted cheers broke out towards the front of the class, but they were short-lived.
 Andrew wasn't in the class, and his friends were probably spending almost as much time thinking about their odds of still winning, as I was.
 I only had three chances left, three in two hundred assuming that everyone else in the school had entered the drawing, which was virtually guaranteed.

In “A Father’s Story”, he tells about Luke, a horse breeder who attempts to live in God’s will yet finds himself needing to choose between what he believes is right in God’s eyes and his daughter’s well-being.
 He chooses for the daughter.
 I confess to finding myself more sympathetic with Luke than with the patriarch Abraham.
 Soren Kierkegaard calls Abraham the Knight of Faith, a fellow so sure of God that even the idea of questioning a command to murder his own son was unthinkable.
 Good for him.
 Honest.
 Luke the horse breeder, I can admire, and Eric I can adore, in part because I know their flaws, their humanity.
 Luke's are exposed in "A Father's Story".
 Eric's I can remember, and for reminders, I have his report cards.

Brandon had to get in from the passenger side of this wreck of a car, symbolic of his wreck of a life.
 My wife and I held each other as we watched him back out of the driveway.
 He couldn’t even look at us as he drove away to God knows where.
 We were numb.
 Our son was 6’2” about 135 pounds and addicted to one of the most powerful drugs on the street: Oxycontin.
 What would happen to him?
 Would he get busted again, overdose or die in a drug deal gone bad?
 We contemplated the worst as we watched what was our son, our first-born, drive off into complete uncertainty.
 We didn’t know Brandon at all, and we really believed we might never see him again.

Human capacity increases the more it is drawn upon.
 It can never be exhausted.
 Developing the human resource should be the centrepiece of all development strategy.
 We can solve today’s most pressing problems if we adopt a total approach which takes into account all the interrelated factors – political, economic, technological, social and environmental – rather than relying on partial strategies.
 Partial remedies, however welcome or desirable, can always generate side-effects – such as the increase in social tensions and violence observed when increasing political and social freedom are not matched by increasing economic opportunity, or the rise in unemployment and arms exports that accompany a reduction in defence expenditure.
 The success of the Green Revolution was due to its integration of technological, institutional, commercial and public policy measures, while its short comings arose from its failure to integrate environmental factors, which are now being incorporated in agricultural development strategies.
 Comprehensive measures can eliminate the side-effects of partial progress.
 The progress of the whole depends on the progress of all its parts.
 Humankind is infinitely enriched by the qualitative diversity of culture and individual expression, but it is immeasurably impoverished by the quantitative abyss which separates the more fortunate from the rest of humanity.
 The most prosperous levels of society cannot fully and finally rise to higher levels of accomplishment and enjoyment without first ensuring that the less fortunate and less productive are helped to obtain the full fruits of life at the present level of social achievement.

Rodregas hit knee high and the man trying to run by went flying head first into the dirt.
 Rodregas knew from the feel of the blow that his sword had hit armor and bounced off.
 It was an Immortal Guard.
 Doi’van shot another arrow almost straight down into the back of the neck of the downed guard.
 The man thrashed once and then laid still.
 The second body flew by in a blur.
 With such swiftness, Rodregas reasoned, he must have a sigil of speed.
 He headed right for Doi’van and was behind Rodregas before he could do anything.
 Doi’van must have seen him coming from his position and he dropped his bow and pulled his great sword.
 The guard must have been thinking “Forest Nymph” due to the nature of the archery attack from the forest because he was unprepared for the strength of the blow.

He stopped just before the next set of homes, for he heard talking.
 Holding Qurrah back, he peered around the corner to find a soldier dressed in finely polished armor raising his sword in salute.
 At first Harruq did not see who he saluted, but an elf fell from the roof and landed before the soldier.
 “An elf,” Harruq whispered, managing to grab Qurrah’s attention.
 Now both peered around the corner, curious why such an exotic creature had arrived mere seconds before war.
 “Greetings, Dieredon,” the soldier hailed, pulling off his helmet.
 He was a middle-aged, blond-haired man who had numerous scars on his face.
 “Greetings to you as well, guard captain Antonil,” Dieredon said, taking a step back and kneeling.
 “Though I fear greetings is all I may offer you.”
 Antonil pointed to the wall, and he asked something which neither could hear when the orc army shouted another communal roar.

“I need more,” Rodregas croaked as he finished the bowl.
 The Nymph, an older man who unlike any Nymph Rodregas was familiar with, had his hair pulled back in a pony tail, nodded but said, “Slowly, too much right away is not good for you.” Rodregas nodded and cleared his throat; which was dry and felt like it had pebbles in it.
 While the bed was normal enough, the walls of the room were strange and seemed to be made of woven branches and some sort of hide or dark canvas pulled between tree branches to form an oval shape.
 “Doi’van and Imeralda, do they live?” he got the words out, though it hurt his throat to speak.
 “Oh, yes, Imeralda is fine,” the Nymph healer responded.
 “She was not hurt at all.
 Doi’van was injured pretty badly, but not as badly as you are.
 You both should be dead from your wounds several times over.
 I thought at first you both had a sigil of healing, that would be the only way for you two to be alive, but Imeralda says that you are both ‘of the blood.’ You are a lucky man, even with your blood, to be alive.” “May I speak to them?” Rodregas asked as he looked around the room or tent.

Most teachers would still offer some kind of extra credit if you begged hard enough.
 I spent the next hour mapping out exactly how I was going to salvage my college prospects, and had more or less pulled myself together by the time English ended.
 My newfound dedication to excellence meant I outdid myself in Algebra.
 I finished up the day's homework, and made it more than halfway through one of my makeup assignments by the time Mrs. Campbell stopped off at my desk.
 "Care to run another errand for me, Adriana?"
 I didn't really want to.
 Not when I'd just discovered I had more studying to do than was humanly possible.
 Still, Mrs. Campbell had always been super nice, if equally stern, and there was only ten more minutes of class left.

Is it better to live, but to live through years of pain and misery?
 Or is it preferable never to have been born in the first place?
 Jim – That’s a hard one.
 I think I’ll go with having been born though.
 For me life is good, even when it’s a giant pain in the nether reigions.

He flinched a little, like maybe my aim had been a little too true.
 He looked for a moment like he was going to say something, but then his phone started vibrating again, and he simply nodded as he turned and walked away, moving much faster by himself than he did when I was with him.
 As I stared at the empty space where he'd been standing just a second before, I felt my chest start to constrict, and my breathing speed up.
 The sense of terror racing along my synapses was completely irrational, and extraordinarily powerful.
 Just as the room began to spin crazily around me, I felt a gentle touch on my shoulder.
 "Mistress Paige, is there anything I can get you?
 Something to eat perhaps?
 Or if you'd rather, I can show you to the theater."
 I chopped off a hysterical burst of laughter just before it managed to emerge full force and totally embarrass me.

It was clearly enchanted since the end glowed with an almost sick yellow color.
 It almost nailed him in the head.
 He dodged down and then in close and with his hands free simply grabbed the opposing squire from the top and bottom edges of his breast plate.
 He then heaved the armored man in the air, something even he could only do for a moment, and then slammed him down onto the smooth sands of the arena.
 Nordien hit with such force that his arms and legs flew like a small doll’s.
 Rodregas fell on top of the armored form, grabbed the bottom of the helmet, and ripped it off.
 Unfortunately, it was firmly secured.
 When Rodregas ripped it off he took a good section of jaw with the helm.
 Rodregas then threw the helm aside and punched the man in the face, full strength, several times.

 Her sobs became louder, and she wrapped her arms around him.

New deal for the self-employed
 Excluding agriculture, there are 104 million self-employed and unpaid family workers in developing countries, representing 37 per cent of the non-agricultural workforce.
 Self-employed persons and the small firms which they establish have enormous potential for rapidly generating large numbers of new jobs and raising productivity to increase incomes, provided the right policy measures are in place to support them.
 Japan’s economic growth has relied heavily on the proliferation of small rural enterprises.
 Today, 74 per cent of the Japanese workforce is employed by small and medium-sized firms.
 China created 101 million jobs between 1985 and 1991, 70 per cent in ‘township and village enterprises’, of which nearly half are privately owned.
 In many countries, a large proportion of small enterprises are established by women and employ predominately women.
 An appropriate mix of policies focusing on access to technology, training, credit, marketing and distribution channels can substantially accelerate self-employment, particularly in the informal sector and rural areas, and among women.
 Expand services
 The service sector represents only 25 per cent of the labour force in developing countries compared with more than 67 per cent in the industrial nations.

 I remember comparing peepees with the girl down the street;  I even remember her name (well, of course I do, my first sex) which was Sandy.
 I remember, as if from a bad dream, a life lesson dream) getting a hellacious shock from our electric football game.
 This was a flat metal gameboard which you plugged into the wall and it vibrated and your defensive and offensive formations danced together (or apart) in random, chaotic tremblings, until the player with the ball (a small plastic chip) was shaken off the playing field.
 I think I piled rubber bricks on the game (although rubber shouldn't give you a shock, should it?)

It was like he was looking at something that wasn't even human.
 My insides seemed to freeze and shrink.
 I couldn't even muster up my normal blush of embarrassment.
 I'd had plenty of people hate me since I'd arrived in Sanctuary, but he was the first person I'd met who I was convinced wouldn't have thrown me a life preserver if I was drowning.
 It wasn't even because saving me would be too much work.
 He was completely convinced the world would be a better place without me.

His upper body jerked left to prevent the sword from going in any further.

 Condemnation followed through, aimed straight for the guard’s throat.
 He ducked underneath the swing, feeling the air of the cut just inches above his head.
 Then he was up, both hands gripping his sword tightly.
 Harruq came charging in, both swords striking.
 The guard parried one after the other, constantly retreating.
 The others came to his aid, swinging careful, tentative blows.

I wondered if my sister was still at the original camp.
 Surely she wasn’t bright enough to figure it out.
 And apparently she wasn’t willing to tell anyone.
 I was returning to the spot I had found the humans the previous day when I ran across one of them alone.
 I hid myself behind a patch of brush to watch him.
 He had a lovely complexion with a hint of bronze and cropped dark brown hair with a few tiny streaks of blond just around his face.
 He looked less like the others I had been watching.
 He was built like the elves, strong and muscled, but still lean.
 He wore plain pants and tall boots.
 His light cloth shirt moved around him as he walked, unlaced at the chest.

 The fog of darkness swirled and recoiled at each word Velixar spoke.
 The cold on his flesh grew sharper as the blackness grew thicker.
 “Be gone from me!” Velixar cried, yanking down his arms.
 Six fingered hands ripped up from the black, some smaller than a child’s, some as large as houses.
 Each one lunged to the sky, clutching and grabbing at the elves that circled above.
 “Retreat!” one elf shouted, banking as black fingers tore through the air just before his mount.
 Another screamed as a hundred tiny hands enveloped him, crushing the life from his body.

The last of his adrenaline faded as images of the child’s quivering lips and trembling hands haunted his vision.

 The kill had been quick, just a single cut through the shoulder blade, the heart, and then the lung.
 No suffering, little pain.
 It was all he could offer.

 His deep voice, like a bear’s growl, seemed right at home in the forest.

 Donovan somehow managed to respectfully circumvent any order he thought prevented him from taking adequate care of Alec's family.

Both to save his sister from marrying a wealthy snob and to prove a theory of his, he decides to rob a pawnbroker, knowing that the act might require murder.

 Early in the novel Raskolnikov is in a tavern with a drunk, Marmeledov, whose daughter Sonia has prostituted herself for the money to feed her destitute step-mother and brothers and sisters.

Such constraints limited part-time jobs to around 10 per cent of the total in Belgium, France, Italy and Spain compared to around 25 per cent in Britain and Denmark.
 4.Modify tax policies:The present income and payroll tax system raises the real cost of labour relative to other resources, such as capital and energy, and thereby discourages job creation.
 It heavily taxes people for working, which indirectly raises the cost of labour and reduces the number of jobs.
 At the same time the system provides investment and depreciation incentives that encourage indus try to shift from labour-intensive to capital-intensive modes of production.
 Much of the shift from labour to capital might not be economically justified were it not for the in-built bias in this system.
 Low levels of taxation on the depletion of non-renewable energy resources in the United States is another distorting influence that makes machine-driven activity more cost-effective than it would otherwise be.
 5.Analyse job impact of government policies: Almost every government policy has a direct or indirect impact on employment.
 Often the relationship is not recognized or intended.

A shuffle of paper sounded as Jason moved around.
 “It’s at the art statue, the one we call the rising hill.
 It’s in the park, remember?” “Of course, when we were younger, we used to try to climb it.” I replied.
 I heard Jason chuckle.
 “Who could forget?
 So I guess I’ll see you there?” “Of course, Jason, I’ll tell Emily.” “I’ll tell Seth then.
 See ya.” Emily’s voice came back.
 “Well, who was it?” “It was Jason, he found the meeting place,” I said.
 “It’s the public art piece we use to climb.” “That makes sense.” She paused.

Collective and coordinated international action is essential to address this problem.
 Despite past failures, new efforts must be made to revive international commodity agreements, preferably covering both producing and consuming countries.
 This will be possible only if developing countries first arrive at a consensus approach among themselves, including the economic costs and benefits, and a financing plan.
 Financing for international commodity stocks could be supplied partly by producer countries in the form of building national stocks under collective supervision.
 Partly, it could come from bank commercial loans against commodity collateral, loans from regional development banks, the World Bank and IMF's Buffer Stock Facility, which has remained almost unused.
 8.Technology transfer: Accelerate transfer of technology to and between developing countries.
 One or more profit-making commercial organizations should be established as a public sector joint venture of developing countries to promote the commercial transfer of technology to, within and between developing countries and to channel the profits from this activity toward research in these countries.
 9.Global employment model: Our efforts to promote employment are constrained by a lack of detailed knowledge of how global labour markets actually work.
 We still do not understand the impact of technology, trade, macro-economic policies, multinational corporations, shifting patterns of foreign investment and many other factors on job creation, and our ignorance severely hampers effective policy formulation and coordination.
 An international research programme should be organized under the ILO to construct a truly global employment model that monitors the impact of technological developments, expanding world trade, plant closings, movement of industry to low-wage countries, agriculture-led industrialization, economic growth, immigration policies, refugee movements and other factors affecting employment opportunities around the world.

Once again he followed up with the same move, stepping forward and slamming his shield forward to either knock his opponent’s weapon or knock the guard himself down.
 Unfortunately, when Rodregas hit this guard he matched his every move for move.
 The guard responded, slamming shield against shield.
 Rodregas had gotten too comfortable with his opponents not being able to match his strength.
 This guard did.
 The Immortal Guard had already launched himself forward and Rodregas’ own speed worked against him.
 As Rodregas’ short sword hit nothing but air, he felt the sharp agony of the guard’s blade piercing his thigh.
 Rodregas used his speed to throw himself back.
 But as he did, he felt another sharp cut hit his upper arm.
 The other men were moving in now that he was off balance.

A shadow formed behind them and I screamed for them to turn around.
 “What the heck?” Seth shouted and pointed.
 Oh snap.
 Chapter 10
 Emily and Jason dashed back to our sides as the shadow became a body.
 It was bigger than the dragon we had rode.
 It had the body of a huge cockroach but its tail was a giant stinger.
 Large, bat wings were holding it up in the air.
 “What is it?” I asked.

Never forget it.

 Qurrah nodded.
 He could feel power creeping out of his master, cold and fierce.
 Soft purple dust flew from his pale hands.
 “The trust between man and elf is broken,” Velixar said.
 “Let the harvest of their distrust begin.”
 Arcane words of power flowed from Velixar.

“He will rule with a flaming torch, and save those who are worthy.
 And for those who aren’t, Well, you better watch out!” They all broke out in crazed laughs, which gave me the impression that each and every one of them was mad.
 Hell, I knew they were already mad.
 They threw dirt at the fire and continued their wild laughs.
 Emily shuddered by me as they lifted their voices in another chorus.
 “He will rise to the heavens, from the very pits of hell, to crush all half-lings and to take their very souls.
 “For the King will rule all, with his cruelty and rage.

Emily jumped out from behind the trees and lifted a flame.
 She twirled it around with the movement of her hands and shot it at the nearest dwarf.
 That started what seemed like a war.
 All the dwarfs scrambled towards us and I simply shot them and Emily fried them.
 Then Jason and Seth dissolved from the shadows and entered the clearing.
 “What are you two doing here?” I yelled across to them, annoyed that they hadn’t made their presence known earlier.
 Seth fought his way over to me, “Why do you need to know?” “Because you just randomly appeared and I would like to know what you’re doing in Emily’s backyard in the middle of the night.” I pointed out and took down the last dwarf.
 We gathered around the barely burning embers, after we had re-entered our own world.
 Emily and I quickly summed up what we had learned from the dwarfs.

“Run, run, run!” Jeremiah shouted to a mother pulling along a young boy.
 “Run west, and don’t look back!” A horrible shriek of pain tore his attention past them to a circle of torches, held by the gathered defenders of the small village.
 He kissed his sword as he approached, horrified by the massacre he saw in the dim light.
 A great half-orc bore down on a strong child of thirteen that Jeremiah knew well.
 Strength in fields and spirit meant little compared to the might of a warrior conducting the dark god’s power.
 Condemnation tore through his rusted sickle, cut his arm from his body, and then hooked around, severing his ankles.
 The boy fell, dying in four pieces.
 Jeremiah knew then he would enter the golden eternity before the dawn.
 Someone swung a torch while another man thrust his short sword.
 The half-orc shattered the sword with a savage swipe while ignoring the torch as it smashed across his leather armor.

The power surged, and Alec's heavy, cool power was joined by something light and laughing.
 Several seconds later, Mallory released Alec with a sigh and fell back in obvious exhaustion.
 Alec watched intently until she shook her head, and then the mask fell for just a second before he locked it back in place, hiding the disappointment that for the slimmest of moments had been plainly written on his expression.
 Mallory reached out, as if to take Alec's hand, but he gently set her hands back on her lap.
 "Nothing's changed.
 We'll just proceed as before.
 Rest now, and should the worst come to pass I'll send Donovan to you."
 A few seconds later Alec and I were outside the cabin, walking back in the direction of the waiting motorcycle.
 I reached out to take his hand, and felt a glimmer of relief when he didn't reject the gesture as he had with Mallory.

Educated unemployment is a direct result of a system that fosters obedience and rote learning rather than individual initiative and creative thinking.
 A new system of development education needs to be introduced at all levels to equip the student with an understanding of his/her society, its achievements and potentials, and the opportunities open to each individual to participate in its future growth.
 The index of its success will be the extent to which students of this curriculum seek self-employment rather than salaried jobs.
 Fifth, minimum and average educational levels should be raised in all countries.
 Two centuries ago education was a luxury of the rich and it was simply inconceivable that every member of the population in any country could receive even a minimum level of education.
 Few of the industrial nations fully meet their own present minimum standards for every citizen.
 These minimums are arbitrary, not optimal.
 Raising the minimum levels of achievement further in all countries may be the most important initiative that governments can render to prepare their citizens for a more productive, prosperous and peaceful future.
 Sixth, new educational systems must be evolved to prepare people for life in the twenty-first century.
 Education imparts knowledge of the past and the general ability to deal with the future, but this ability is only in potential.

That year, the Yankees won in five games.
 The following week my mom stayed home from her job, teaching eighth-grade English.
 Her headache was so wicked, she grimaced and groaned.
 I tried to coax her to the doctor.
 She said he had already given her pain pills, which was all he could do.
 Then I came home from school and found her lying in a heap beside her bed.
 Breathing in shallow puffs, eyes open and watery.
 Above the right eye was a long gash, already scabbed over.
 I suspected a prowler had clubbed her and swiped her few items of jewelry.

 “It seemed to work with your lunch.” I remembered the meat I had burnt and flushed.
 “Yes, this will do,” she hummed with a sly grin.
 “Let me see… yes, I’ve got it.” She began stepping a slow circle around me, talking as she moved, suddenly cat-like.
 “The dreams you had after the fairy dust, do you remember them?” Oh.

 It took a while for her to get the hang of it, but an hour or so later, she was cruising around the parking lot, making reasonably smooth starts and stops.

 It was in style identical to the first room of the Celestial Beasts except instead of great beasts on pedestals, it held crouching daemons in pits.
 The previous vague smell of brimstone and hellfire wafted fully into the room.
 Doi’van and Rodregas stepped into the room but paused when Imeralda did not follow.
 He looked back and she looked confused, squinting as if the room was not fully illuminated by the glowing daemons in their pits.
 “Can you not see into the room?” Rodregas asked.
 “No, I can see something, shapes flicking in fire?
 I think I smell something like rotten eggs, but I can’t see well enough to go in.

 Alec shrugged.

 He relished the feel, knowing that one day he would speak the words in such a manner.
 Velixar lifted his hands to the sky, shouting out the last of the spell.
 The final command came shrieking forth from his lips.
 “ _Rise!_ ”
 In the distance, dark shapes rose from the grass.

Mom looked away from the skyline, a new batch of concern painted across her features.
 "I'm so sorry, dear.
 I didn't particularly approve of him, but I wasn't going to get really vocal about it.
 Not when he was your first boyfriend.
 What happened?"
 I didn't have to pretend to be hurt and disappointed.
 Even knowing that Alec was everything I'd thought Brandon was, I still felt used and disappointed.
 "I just wasn't what he was looking for.
 He made it very clear the last time I saw him."

He held Britney before him, ostensibly caressing her, but in reality using her as a shield, his dark eyes daring Alec to attack.
 Britney was apparently unable to sense the crackling power surrounding her.
 She looked completely unconcerned, ecstatic even to be where she was, clasped in Brandon's left arm.
 Brandon's lips drew back, but it wasn't in a smile, it was the human equivalent to showing his hackles.
 "Break it up!
 You kids back off!"
 The words seemed to float in from far away.
 They certainly didn't have an effect on any of the shape shifters.
 Vincent was moving too slowly for my human eyes to detect any change, but I was sure he was closer now than the last time I'd looked.

It collided with his head and Seth dropped his sword.
 He crumpled to ground and didn't move.
 “Seth!” I screamed.
 He didn't move and one of the faery men reached down to grab him but I screeched, “Leave him alone!” and sent an arrow into the guy's neck.
 I heard Jason yell in rage and they started to drop like stones.
 Emily raised her arms and the ground shook under a faery.
 Roots twisted upward and wrapped around one of the five faery men that were left.
 The other four fell dead from my arrows and Jason's knives.

He blocked the blow with his sword and then bashed down quick and hard multiple times with his shield.
 He thought he heard a bone break.
 Rodregas paused and the knight signaled him as victor with a finger to the Heavens.
 Rodregas followed this pattern throughout the day.
 He kept using his sword more to block than to attack and kept using his shield offensively.
 This allowed him to take advantage of his unnatural strength to overwhelm his foes.
 According to the contest rules, he could replace his shield after every fourth match if need be.
 By the final match, he was on his third and final shield.
 Most of the rest of the matches were with squires with no ribbons.

So, there were a lot of us cats playing the guitar, and…uh, I’ve lost the thread of what I was saying.
 CM:  	What about Dylan?
 BG: 	I have confused recollections of my first awareness of Bob Dylan.
 I have a vague memory of hearing “Song for Woody” on FM 100, back in Memphis, which at that time was an album-oriented station, not limited to a ludicrous playlist like it is today.
 It was a source back then, a touchstone.
 You could hear music unavailable elsewhere.
 The music of the planets.
 I listened to it alone in my parent’s living room, hearing sounds that transformed me as surely as did Lorelei, the finding of my own voice.

A few seconds later I finally recognized that the subject of the piece was a female, reaching out towards the point of view with glowing hands.
 "She's beautiful.
 It's how I always imagined an angel would appear."
 Alec was silent for so long I finally tore my gaze from his masterpiece long enough to find that he was staring at me with surprise.
 "It's you, Adri.
 Of course it's beautiful."
 For a second I couldn't breathe.
 It seemed so utterly impossible.
 Maybe it could've been a painting of Cindi, but not one of me.
 I couldn't possibly be the gorgeous figure he'd brought to life on his canvas.

Normally that wouldn't have caused me to even pause in my normal routine, but it suddenly felt as if the stall was too small.
 "I told you to stay away from him, you stupid whore."
 I didn't recognize the voice for all that I felt like I should.
 It was a snarling alto that even distorted by anger had traces of smooth velvet, the kind of voice guys occasionally fantasized about, when they weren't thinking about other, less subtle, feminine features.
 Something hit the stall next to me, hard enough to leave dents.
 I was scared, I should have been terrified, but I was too busy trying to breathe.
 It was like the air had become thick, and although the fine strands of hair on the back of my neck hadn't moved, it felt like they should be standing on end.
 I heard indistinct sobbing, and then the voice returned and made me shiver.
 The sensation started somewhere on my back, and traveled forward like it was clawing to get out of my face.

I opened my mouth to protest, but closed it at a sharp jab in the ribs from Rachel.
 "The ancient laws don't support her life being a disposable commodity, extinguished at your whim.
 Not even the bond of Ja'tell provides you with that right."
 Brandon's grin was wider even than before.
 "Ah, but those aren't the laws under which we labor now, are they?
 She's mine, and I have every right to do whatever I wish to her.
 Her presence among your pack is a direct affront to my rights and honor.
 I could demand your life, be glad I'm only requiring two of your pack."

 Liz – Why am I not surprised…
 Jim – Wouldn’t that be something that would have either a yes or no answer?

 "Come on--let's go have some breakfast, and we'll see what else we can think of."
 She let him lead her back to his house.
 Sitting at the table while he made breakfast, she wiped her eyes and cheeks and nose with a paper napkin.
 "I'm never going to get back."
 "Sure you will."

 Her heart tightened.

 He stroked her cheek with his forefinger.

"Listen, I don't mean to be rude, but I've got to finish up my physics homework.
 Can we catch up during lunch?"
 Britney looked a little crestfallen, but her eyes quickly lit back up, and before I could get my notebook out and start writing, she'd already switched seats to one closer to a gaggle of cheerleaders.
 It was amazing that I hadn't made the connection between light, the fact that light acted like a wave, and the rainbows on the parking lot puddles, but it was all making sense now.
 By the time the bell finally rang to release the circus back into the halls, I'd finished up a reasonable outline, and was feeling pretty smart.
 Alec probably expected me to have been totally stumped, but I'd figured out the exact answer to the assignment, and I was so going to show him.
 The glow of satisfaction more than made up for the fact that Britney chattered non-stop on our way to Algebra.
 I felt like I should feel guilty for not liking her, but I was starting to notice how much of her conversation revolved around nasty gossip that made everyone else in the school sound like rejects or sluts.
 When we finally made it to Mrs. Campbell's class, I slid into my seat with a sigh of relief.
 This was the one class all day where I could virtually guarantee I wouldn't be talking to anyone.

Black Lung was born in the mid-sixties in an abandoned gas station when a bass player named Crafty Connor was introduced to Buddy through the coagulant Sid Selvidge.
 Memphis music bred Memphis music, is how Sid describes it today.
 Crafty, who had a face like moits in wool, attended East High where he had picked up the bass guitar (and put down his flugel horn much to his parents’ disfavor) when he first heard Jack Bruce play.
 He wanted to be part of a power trio.
 He wanted to be part of the best power trio Memphis could build and he wanted to build it.
 He called Sid who said, “Well, you could do a lot worse than hooking up with this young guitar kraken, Buddy Gardner.”  Crafty called Buddy.
 Buddy called Skippy Quetzalcoatl, who had a drumming lineage like no one else’s.
 His father had been a drummer and his father before him and back and back.
 Beale Street whispers the name Quetzalcoatl, late nights when the horns have died down and the wind sloughs around shop corners and up alleyways.
 It whispers the name like a mojo, a bit of song never transcribed, a bit of the old magic.

A swirling black portal ripped into existence behind him, a bleak wind wailing from it.
 Out came his undead, marching in rows of ten.
 More than a hundred rows spilled out, surrounding their master with mindless perfection.
 “Find him,” he ordered as he covered his face with his hood.
 “He is wounded.
 Find him and kill him.”
 As one, the thousand moaned their acknowledgment.
 They scattered, spreading out like a ripple in a pond.
 In the center stood Velixar, his hands out and his eyes closed.
 “Reveal yourself to any one of them and I will know it,” he said, his sick face smiling.

How?”
 The half-orc reached over, erased the k in his name and drew a clumsy, capitalized Q at the end.
 He leaned back and smiled.
 The name in the dirt now read ‘HarruQ’.
 “Why did you change it?” she asked.
 “It’s a rather odd spelling.”
 “Look at my brother’s name,” he said.
 Aurelia did, and then she saw what Harruq had also seen.
 “Your name is your brother’s, only backwards.”

 Art – All people need is love and happiness.

His new opponent never knew he was coming.
 He was heavily covered in armor with little visibility so he never saw Rodregas jumping on him from behind.
 This opponent was smaller and crashed to the ground at the unexpected weight of the attack.
 Rodregas was more careful in ripping off this squire’s helm, and punched him in the face but once.
 It was enough.
 He took out four other squires before anyone seemed to realize that he had changed the rules.
 Not to his surprise, it was Geriodon who was the first to face him and fend him off.
 Rodregas almost ran face into the squire’s mace, only throwing himself down barely in time to miss the blow.
 Rodregas knew that if this was going to work he had to keep up the momentum.

Frost beasts don’t appear until the end of fall and into winter.
 They love the cold and can’t stand the heat.
 That’s why I knew something was wrong right away, because it shouldn’t have been here.
 It was against its nature and when nature goes wrong, that’s a big sign.
 I pulled back on the string but Emily ran forward and shot fire.
 The beast simply opened its mouth and breathed.
 What was a shot of fire was now a single icicle that landed on the ground in front of it.
 Instead Jason came forward and attacked with his knives.

We nearly died because it was the right thing to do to rescue the Nymphs, especially with the children being part of the caravan.” Rodregas added in a growl, “There were probably Dire steeds as well.” “By the Infernal Daemons, I might be as strong as a Celestial Lion, but we are going to get chopped to little pieces until we have decent armor and weapons.” “But why would they keep the armor?” growled Doi’van.
 “These people do not seem to be warriors.
 What good would it do them?” Doi’van tossed his wild black mane of hair and his eyes lighted with rage.
 Rodregas suddenly realized that he better not feed the Hellborn’s rage.
 Those with Infernal blood were known for their berserker rages.
 They seldom survived the rampages, but were nearly unstoppable when they fell into one.
 Rodregas breathed deeply, trying to lower his own anger and frustration.
 Jordaan stepped outside the room Rodregas had been staying in and into the small clearing that was the center of the Nymph Dwello, the tent like structure that they used for houses.
 “Gentleman, please,” said Jordaan.

 CHAPTER 9 INTO THE FIRES
 Six days later the three of them found themselves ready to cross the Old Princess Road.
 Imeralda had been scouting ahead and she signaled for the two men to stay back in the trees.
 As a half Forest Nymph she seemed to be able to disappear into the forest.
 Rodregas quickly learned how she had been able to track him from Raven Keep.
 While she claimed that other Forest Nymphs had far better skills, Rodregas had never seen anyone to match her abilities.
 They had taken the three horses back up the trail where any sounds they made would not be heard from the road.
 Then Doi’van and Rodregas had found some cover that still gave a good view of the road.

"I don't know.
 It isn't anything I can really put a name too, but I'm usually pretty good at reading people, and something seems to be bothering you.

 The smile was back, and at near normal intensity.
 "Distracting is as good a description as any.

The scent of mourning floated throughout the town, and he paused to enjoy the bittersweet strands of death that tugged on his heart.
 So many souls lost in battle, and even in the quiet aftermath, it was intoxicating.
 “No sleep tonight,” he said, turning back to the building that had been his shelter.
 Fire swarmed around his fingers.
 Like streams of water, it flowed from his hands, splashing across the roof and setting it ablaze.
 Finished, he ran for an alley to hide as the fire gained the attention of the many patrols.
 He heard footsteps and shouts further down the road so he ducked left, running in between homes as all around the shouts grew louder.
 The houses ended, and like a fleeing thief he burst out into the streets only to slam into a drunken man holding a small bottle.
 The two rolled, a tangle of legs and arms.

My ears were still ringing from the harsh song, but the bird lay dead on the wood planks below the window.
 Chevelle started to turn to find the source of the muffled thump and, before I realized what I was doing, I flicked my right hand and the bird’s body flopped behind a shelf out of sight.
 When Chevelle turned back to me, I stared right into his eyes as if I had not seen or heard a thing, wondering why he wasn’t still explaining the histories of Grah.
 He glanced past me… or maybe at the crown of my head.
 Like he was avoiding my eyes.
 My lying eyes.
 I was too worried about being caught to feel guilty about the bird, to think about its soft gray feathers, that wing that was bent not-quite-right beneath it.
 I didn’t know about where Chevelle was from, but around here you didn’t just kill birds.
 Especially not for singing.

I was surprised and more than a little grateful to find a shelter had already been set up for me.
 The idea of being drenched hadn’t mattered until the cool air cut across the lake.
 Chevelle nodded toward the hut as he prepared a fire, and I found my pack on a bed of birch branches, along with a pile of dry clothes.
 As I tugged off my soaked pants to exchange them for the new ones, I wondered if Chevelle had brought both sets or if they’d been packed by Junnie in that small, strange village.
 I couldn’t fathom why I hadn’t considered he’d so easily be able to follow me when I’d run from there, how I’d been oblivious to the dangers of being caught.
 The shirt was fitted to my shape but of a heavier fabric, and a pair of boots was at the bottom of the stack; it must be much colder in the mountains.
 It reminded me of stepping out of the cold wet gown on the bank of the creek, finding the scroll, the map.
 Chevelle’s words echoed in my mind.
 I’m sorry, Freya.
 I let you down at the creek.

The blow was quick, and I hadn’t seen it coming.
 My head turned with the contact, whipping back toward her before I had a chance to rein in the shock and anger.
 Fannie’s eyes lit with anticipation.
 Like she wanted me to fight back.
 I had never even talked back to Fannie.
 I didn’t have the size to fight her, let alone the magic.
 And she was conniving.
 When I’d first come to live with her she had sent me to Council repeatedly, complaining of my behavior.
 I had undergone hours of “evaluations” under the scrutiny of Council members.
 Exams and trials and endless questions.

In many developing countries, inefficient bureaucracies are slow to take decisions, issue licences, review applications, sanction loans, and amend legislation.
 This inefficiency directly impacts on the pace of development.
 Streamlining and expediting decision making and the movement of other social resources is a highly effective strategy for spurring development.
 Comparative scales need to be created to measure the movement of each of these social forces within and between nations.
 Strategies can be evolved to stimulate more rapid overall development by directly acting to increase the velocity of these forces up to ten-fold or even more.
 Progressive Attitudes
 The world we live in today is an external expression of our inner attitudes.
 The world we aspire towards can be realized only by acquiring the attitudes corresponding to those achievements.

“You thank it like you would thank anyone else,” A voice said.
 I almost jumped to the moon in surprise.
 Out of nowhere someone, or something, appeared beside Jason.
 I think Jason was more scared because he actually jumped into the air.
 As it came into view, it became obvious that it was a girl.
 She in a yellow cloak and had dazzling red hair.
 She smiled warmly at us with her chocolate brown eyes and I realized she had pointed ears.
 So I basically made the conclusion that she wasn’t human.

 Home to the two half-orcs was in the older, mostly abandoned southern district of Veldaren.
 Those with wealth had drifted northeast, closer to the castle and away from the busy streets and markets.
 When King Vaelor had ordered all trade to come in through the western gate, and not the south, it had been the final nail in the district’s coffin.
 The homeless, hungry, and destitute flooded the rows of abandoned buildings, clawing them away from their legal owners with their very presence, or sometimes their murders.

She grunted and let go, growled and stepped over the bear’s body.
 He slowly reached up, and using the full strength of his body, pushed hard on her muscular chest, pushing her away from the bear’s haunch.
 He then ignored her and went back to cutting the haunch loose.
 He waited but the two lionesses seemed to have gone from aggression to napping, with him missing the transition.
 Slowly, Rodregas got up with his bear haunch and took it back to the barn.
 He met the surprised look of Doi’van and Imeralda with a half smile, “I hope you like the taste of bear?” As he was unsure of how old the meat was, he immediately started a fire and started to cook it.
 As he worked on preparing the fire he explained what had happened.
 “Are you suicidal?” asked Imeralda in an angry voice.
 “I know you felt they were not a danger, but to walk up and take the food from two Dire Cats?
 That is just asking to be killed.” Her voice was unusually high pitched and she was shaking her head in disbelief.

 Rodregas opened it to find only a few silvers.
 He knew Korin should have more.
 He opened his shirt and, as he suspected, another purse hung from his neck.
 It was of flat leather and inside it were twelve pieces of silver and a small book.
 Rodregas tentatively touched the book and it buzzed slightly of magic.
 It held no foulness so he tossed it into the trunk.
 He added the coin purses to the robe he was wearing.
 He still needed more hard money and some decent clothes.

 After bathing, she put on her emerald underwear and a simple white dress and went out into the garden.

She would have sworn that her father was more like Davis than like Rick, but she was pleased to realize that he really was more like Rick.
 He'd stayed home from work to be with her, and he'd held her.
 And he hadn't been upset that she'd broken up with Davis.
 He just wanted her to be happy.
 That was what Rick wanted for her.
 Tears tightened her throat as she remembered the anguish on his face when he'd told her that he was the key to the doorway to 1927.
 He'd desperately wanted to keep her with him, to marry her, and he could have kept his discovery to himself and never told her he knew how to help her get home.
 But he'd wanted what was best for her.

 Then, supposing I knew as much about love as I ever would, I turned to reading mystery novels, since writing them had become my occupation.

 “Fainting Spell, A Bagatelle.”  That was it.
 By The Holly and IV.
 I can’t tell you who that really is.

 There was no more talking, each had plenty of their own thoughts to mull over.
 Rodregas was feeling pretty good at the moment, dangerously positive.
 He had learned long ago that the better you felt, the harder came the emotional fall.
 He knew this was all too good to last, but knowing that it would not last also made it more important that he enjoy the moment.
 Rodregas was free.
 He was being hunted; but hunted because he had finally dealt out justice.
 He had killed two monsters, two who wore faces not their own, and who he could feel no remorse for killing.
 Rodregas had finally escaped to his quiet place in the mountains to rest and, best of all, with two companions who seemed to be good people.

The elf’s face exploded.
 Qurrah fell over onto his side, breathing as slowly as he could through the blood that filled his throat.
 The dead body of the elf crumpled in front of him, all of his hate-filled features gone from his face except for a single eye.
 The half-orc stared, wondering if his brother was truly dead.
 Darkness crept at the corner of his sight.
 His strength was fading fast, and he had little doubt that if he passed out he would never wake.
 He struggled to lift a single numb hand, then flopped it down on top of the dead elf’s leg.

Before we'd even made it out of the parking lot, Britney was once again chattering about everyone else in the school and what they were or weren't doing lately.
 Considering that I still couldn't put a face with most of the names she was tossing around, the gossip wasn't just uninteresting, it was a near ordeal.
 It wasn't until I looked over at the speedometer that I realized we really had been driving longer than normal rather than the gossip just making it seem to take forever.
 Britney caught me registering the fact she was driving under the speed limit for the first time I could remember, and broke off recounting Amy Stevens' supposed fling with one of the football players just long enough to blush.
 "I figured I should be more careful of how fast I drive.
 You know, my dad keeps threatening to take away my car if I get any more tickets.
 With everything else going on right now he just might do it."
 It was actually pretty plausible.

 I suddenly felt like there was a joke I was missing out on.
 "How do you propose to fix that?"
 "It was my fault so I'll be your ride back and forth from school every day."

Once we finished she turned on the television and told us to listen for conjugation.
 I almost wished I shared the class with Britney, her dad seemed like the type to get six kinds of riled up over something like that.
 He'd probably go straight to the school board and demand a new Spanish teacher altogether.
 It was a real relief when I was finally able to leave the drab little classroom.
 I stopped off at my locker before heading to the tutor room, but Britney was nowhere to be seen.
 Probably still mad.
 I mentally shrugged as I swapped out books, and set off.
 Rachel was already seated in her usual spot in no-man's-land.
 I debated where to sit for a second.

I expected him to take one look at the sub and turn around like he'd done before, but he registered the presence of a substitute and then came inside regardless.
 It didn't make sense until the first girl all but fainted as he walked past her desk.
 Of course.
 He didn't like substitutes, and figured he had better places to be, but the draw of hero worship after having almost double-teamed Vincent was just too much to resist.
 The sub took a desultory roll, and then waved his hands at us.

Rodregas had never done it; he had learned that there were better ways to kill a man than trying to break his spine with bare hands.
 But with the memory of Korin breaking Jorin’s neck, adrenaline pounded in his new arms.
 This was justice long overdue.
 With a quick movement of his arms and the haunting memory of the sounds of crunching and popping from all those years ago, he twisted Korin’s head nearly all the way around.
 Rodregas held his body as it spasmed wildly for a moment.
 Then the Adapt went still and limp; and Rodregas dropped him to the floor.
 Korin’s’ body hit the floor and started to empty itself.
 “Gods,” he thought and asked out loud to no one, “What did he eat this morning?” He grabbed the body and dragged it into the water closet and dropped it into the small bronze tub.
 Rodregas started to leave and then saw Korin’s purse; the Adapt was dressed for travel and Rodregas had yet to find even a single coin in the Master’s chambers.
 He reached down and took the purse off his belt.

Even that didn't last; it felt like I was sweating again before I even finished dressing.
 I finally pulled out my Biology book.
 A coldly rational part of me knew that however this ended up playing out, I'd still have a test on Monday, and I'd still want to pass.
 It'd be nice sometimes to make the kind of dramatic gesture that you see on movies, or read about in books.
 Instead, I was sitting here with a stupid textbook while everything else inside of me hurt in a funny, cold kind of way.
 Like it hurt so much I could only feel the edges of the pain.
 Spanish followed Biology; then other subjects came and went until I felt like I'd made enough progress, or possibly wasted enough time.
 I collapsed into bed hours early and slept poorly.
 Sunday was about the same, only my insides felt even rawer under the calm surface.
 Like maybe they'd had something caustic poured on them.

Jim – Gene promised Art he would stay out of trouble.
 Liz – Well he hasn’t gotten into trouble yet.
 You’ve missed a lot of stupid practical jokes.
 Mostly those two play them on one another, sometimes on Art.
 The quality of his jokes has suffered ever since he promised not to get into trouble.

No magic.
 I could see why they used weapons.
 Chevelle pushed harder, assaulting me with faster and stronger swings.
 I was able to defend myself if I focused.
 Murmurs of approval floated in from our audience.
 I enjoyed that more than I probably should have.
 I concentrated hard and began throwing a few good hits of my own in with the blocks.
 Our swords clashed repeatedly, neither of us hitting the mark.
 I was certain he could have, but confident I was blocking well.
 We continued until I became winded, then Chevelle lowered his blade, smiling with approval.

 Dedication I dedicate this book to my wife Lisa, the one person who has been with me through more ups and downs than anyone could ever imagine.
 You never know when or if the perfect person will appear.
 The fateful night I set eyes on her set in motion everything that would happen to me for the rest of my life.
 I couldn’t be happier that I was fortunate enough to be in the right place at the perfect time to meet my soul mate.
 She is the most beautiful person, both inside and out.

The airy, sunlit room we walked into was almost like being outside.
 There were a number of plants scattered about the space, some resting on the floor, others on a variety of slender stands.
 The effect was ethereal.
 It was hard to imagine that any of the spun-metal stands could support anything more substantial than a box of Kleenex.
 It wasn't until we were further inside that I realized there was an entire alcove off to one side, almost completely dominated by a black grand piano.
 The piano was so breathtaking it was several seconds before I realized there was someone sitting at it.
 "Alec.

Emily raised an eyebrow, “Should we be concerned?” “Nah they’re boys, let them do what they have to do,” I said with a quick sigh.
 While we were walking the boys appeared in front of us, holding something behind their backs.
 They seemed to be fighting giggles which usually meant they were hiding something.
 Or they were about to do something that fell under their category of “funny”.
 “Hi guys,” Seth said still fighting a smirk.
 “Hi,” I replied cautiously.
 “What are you guys hiding?” Jason’s face twisted up and a snort of laughter fought its way out of his nose.
 “Nothing.” “Right…” Emily gave me a look that said, is this good or bad?
 I didn’t really have an answer for her but I knew that whatever was coming, it wasn’t going to be good.
 “So Jason, we have a question for you.” I nodded towards Emily.

They weren’t smiling or doing anything suspicious so I figured we were safe, for now.
 They sat down across from us.
 I noticed that Seth was avoiding my eyes.
 “So whose crazy idea was it to meet under a truce when we’re having so much fun wreaking havoc on each other?” Jason asked.
 Emily sighed and pointed at me, “This crazy person right here.” “So what do you want?” he continued and eyed me.
 I took a small, quiet breath and said what I had planned, “I want to work on the dwarf problem.” I nodded towards Emily, signaling her to take out her paper.
 She groaned and pulled the folded piece of paper out of her pocket.
 She unfolded it and placed it in front of us.
 While we studied it, I tried to catch Seth’s eye, but he didn’t look at me.
 I felt something boil deep within me-the anger at him.

He wet a washcloth for her and one for himself.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, handing her a washcloth as she straightened.
 "I should keep all these disturbing thoughts to myself."
 With trembling hands, she began washing her face.
 "I feel torn completely in two.
 I don't think I can ever be happy again.
 When I go back, I'll be miserably lonely for you.
 But if I were to stay here, I'd miss my family, my home, my roots.

A small act of atonement, but still a start nonetheless."
 It was all so surprising that it took me a moment to find my voice.
 "Thank you, Donovan.
 Have I slept in too long?"
 A gentle smile met my inquiry.
 "Those of us who don't require normal amounts of sleep have all been up for quite some time, with the exception of Master Alec, who remained abed for an uncharacteristic length of time, but the rest of the house is just now waking.
 In fact I rather suspect you have just enough time to shower and eat before Mistress Rachel will be pounding on the door, as it were, in excitement for your upcoming trip into town."
 A groan escaped me despite my best efforts.
 Donovan was too polite to ask outright, but I had to respond to his raised eyebrow or he might think I didn't want to talk to Rachel.
 "I'm sorry, Donovan, it's just that I really hate shopping."

Rodregas’ face was covered in gore and blood.
 It was hard for him to see.
 He struggled back up, but fell, then Rodregas felt a presence to his right.
 It was too small to be Doi’van and Rodregas staggered over reaching for him, determined to take one final slaver with him.
 His wounded leg buckled again, and Rodregas tried to reach for the ground to slow his fall, but something was wrong with his arm and it did not move.
 For a split second he saw the ground coming up to hit him in the face.
 And then... darkness.
 CHAPTER 10 THE OTHER KIND OF PAIN

She doesn't mean anything to you.
 What about me?"
 Jasmin stopped moving.
 She was still shaking, and when she looked up at me, her eyes still bubbled with hate, but they were human again instead of the pale, ice blue from a moment before.
 With a visible effort of will, Jasmin closed her eyes, calmed her shaking body, and then turned and quickly walked out of the room.
 I was just tall enough to see over Rachel and take in what was going on in the rest of the room.
 James' eyes were still yellow, and he was still inching his way towards me, obviously undeterred by Jasmin's defection.
 The Hispanic girl carefully closed the distance between them, and then placed her slender, perfect dark hand on James' arm once again as she leaned in and whispered something in his ear.
 For a moment it seemed he was going to shake her off again but then he shuddered, shot Alec another dirty look, and stormed out of the room.
 The tiny form following after him looked like a fragile schooner trailing along the edge of a hurricane.

The house lights were still bright enough for me to make out every detail of his perfect face, and yet I was still baffled by his expression.
 He'd obviously been staring at me, was still staring at me actually, but it wasn't a leer.
 It was something else, it made me want to blush, or maybe smile and toss my hair.
 Whatever it was, it left my skin feeling warmer than usual, and more than a little tight.
 Even after I looked away with a flush of embarrassment, I still felt like I could feel his eyes watching me.
 I could feel his presence behind and to the left of me, like a gentle tingle of electricity I could've pointed to even with my eyes closed.
 I resisted the urge to look back again as the lights dimmed and the orchestra began the opening strains of the first number.
 The actor playing Jean Valjean strode out onto the stage, and even weighed down by chains, he still commanded everyone's attention as though he was a member of the nobility.
 Each successive character somehow managed to latch onto my heart as they arrived.
 Despite the nagging sensation that I could feel Alec behind me, the first few minutes of the play exceeded all my hopes.

A dwarf?
 I elbowed Emily in the arm, “Uh Emily, is a dwarf using a slide a normal thing?” I nodded in the direction of the dwarf and her eyes widened in surprise.
 She jumped off the swing and grabbed me by the arm.
 She ran over to Jason and gripped his arm with her free hand, pulling us both after her.
 Seth frowned but had no choice but to follow.
 “Where’s the dwarf?” she asked quickly.
 “Climbing the slide.
 Weird huh?” I almost tripped but I caught myself.
 She pushed us into the woods, “We got to move fast before someone gets hurt.
 Make sure no one is around.” In a matter of seconds, I had an arrow in my bow, Seth had his sword in his hand and Jason had his hands full of knives.

Bewildered and a little hurt, he sat down on the opposite end and turned on the TV.
 After a few minutes of channel surfing, he pressed the mute button.

One sword came from above, aiming for her shoulder, while the other thrust low.
 The staff twirled, batting the thrust to one side.
 Aurelia spun, evading a downward strike slicing through the air by just an inch.
 She continued the turn, her staff whirling.
 The swords sliced, trying to block, but they were too slow.
 The staff cracked against Harruq’s forehead.
 He staggered backward, his eyes going wide and blank.
 “You could fell an ogre with that hit,” he said.

 “Or maybe it’ll be terrible.

Velixar smiled, clearly seeing the desire the half-orc hid behind his eyes.
 “One day you will hold such control.
 For now, be content with what I have taught you.”

 Harruq did not know why, but the short exchange sent chills running to the pit of his stomach.

 Toad dwarf told Seth, “You won’t stop him, little warrior.” Does this mean he’s powerful?
 Toad dwarf said to Jason, “He will destroy all half-ling.” What does “half-ling” mean?
 Toad dwarf said to Emily, “Kill all you like but Kojas will rise.
 Is Kojas the person they’ve been talking about?
 Who is he?
 Toad dwarf said to Jazell, “The one will rise, the one will rise!
 He will destroy you!” Is Kojas’ rising?
 Toad dwarf said to Jason, “The King will rise.” She placed her notes in the middle so we could read it.

But I am no prude, and we had our share of parties and events in Tahoe and at the waterbed store.
 When you put a bunch of twenty year olds and their friends in a retail store that has working hot tubs and waterbeds, things can quickly spiral out of control.
 We had no window coverings and our parties were in plain view of anyone who put their nose against the windows.
 It was a voyeurs’ paradise and I am sure we entertained a lot of shocked window shoppers late into the night!
 Pete proved to be a bad choice of a business partner, as his use of cocaine escalated to the point of total addiction.
 In less than a year he would snort everything he could get his hands on.
 He was stealing money from the checking account and drop-shipping inventory from our business directly to drug dealers to feed his habit.
 My own brother Thomas was one of the many drug dealers receiving this merchandise for pennies on the dollar in exchange for cocaine and marijuana.
 This would be one of the many actions that would drive a wedge between Thomas and me as drugs and money started to always come before family.
 It hurt me deeply to contemplate Thomas’s complete disregard for our relationship as brothers and his choice to take this merchandise from my addicted partner while knowing full well that it would financially destroy my business and thus me.

The institution that had come to symbolize the Cold War must be restructured in such a manner as to symbolize the abolition of all war and the establishment of peace and democracy as the foundations for global development.
 Global Social Revolution
 A second revolution also possesses tremendous transforming power to accelerate human progress – the revolution of rising expectations.
 This revolution is not new in conception or expression, but what is new is its rapid extension to encompass people and nations around the globe.
 Although the term was first applied to describe the growing aspirations of the middle class in North America forty years ago, it is now widely applicable to all social and economic groups in both developed and developing countries.
 After countless centuries of slow, often imperceptible progress, humanity everywhere is on the move.
 A rising tide of technological advancement has brought with it wave after wave of social innovation.
 Democracy has liberated long suppressed populations from military or political oppression.
 With the passing of colonialism, a new generation of youth has come of age in developing countries that never lived under the fear, compulsion and humiliation of colonial rule.
 The knowledge imparted by the spread of universal education has removed much of the ignorance and superstition, the submissiveness and sense of inferiority that limited people’s mental and social horizons in the past.

n That is92m the0m current unexpected growth of collective92m power0m that is generated by the spread of knowledge. To encompass all social groups around the globe, this92m must0m be achieved by the enlightenment and rapid diffusion92m of0m knowledge and power.

“Nothing I can’t handle,” said the other before smashing the butt of his sword into Harruq’s face.
 Rage surged through the half-orc’s veins, his orcish side screaming for blood.
 He fought it down even as a mailed fist smashed against his spine.
 Harruq collapsed to his knees, choking down a furious roar.
 “Goes down easy, I say,” the guard said to the bowman.
 “How much you want to bet this guy is the sick bastard killing the kids?”
 “How much you wanna bet we can hang him even if he isn’t?” the other asked.
 Both guards laughed, and the sickness in Harruq’s gut grew.

 Visions of ripping out entrails filled his mind, and all his willpower kept him crouched there.

 Spending that much time around you is bound to give me bad habits.”
 She handed over the book.
 Harruq opened it and flipped through the pages.
 Each one depicted various symbols, lines, and curls.
 Aurelia winced at the rough way he handled the paper.
 “What are these?” he asked.

At the same time there are a number of positive factors that offer opportunities to increase productivity significantly in the near to middle term.
 Closing the productivity gap
 A survey comparing the levels of productivity for major crops between countries reveals a wide disparity between proven technological potentials and actual field results for every crop.
 Cereal yields in Western Europe and North America average 4.5 tons per hectare, compared to three tons in Asia, 2.3 tons in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, two tons in Latin America and slightly more than one ton in Africa.
 The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) projects a 40 per cent increase in wheat yields in 92 developing countries, excluding China, by 2010.
 In rice, countries with widely differing climatic conditions, such as Australia, Korea, Egypt, Spain, Japan and Italy, achieve average yields nearly double the world average and two to three times the yields achieved in countries such as India, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.
 Total rice yields in 92 developing countries are expected to rise to 37 per cent by 2010.
 Maize yields in Greece, Chile, Austria, Italy and Germany average more than double the world average, and five to six times the averages achieved in large maize-producing countries such as India.
 Even comparing areas under irrigated maize, average yields range from 1.5 to 8.4 tons per hectare.
 New varieties of maize are under development that yield 30 per cent more grain in a drought season than conventional varieties.

 She blushed just thinking about how they made her feel.
 He kissed her lips softly.
 "Do you know what my life was like before you came?

 I was really lonely, but I'd just about given up.

 He reached up and tucked a stray hair behind my left ear.
 "Whatever the reason, since your arrival here, I just feel like parts of me that were missing have come back home.
 Even when I thought you were some kind of...rogue...shape shifter come to destroy my pack, I was still drawn to you."

The contestants stood around the squares waiting their turn to enter.
 They would push anyone falling out back into the squares.
 Watchers were not allowed around the squares.
 Rodregas knew Imeralda and Doi’van were atop the wall, the closest spot allowed for spectators.
 Two contestants had already fought.
 The rules were simple.
 Two went in and one came out walking.
 The constants were bare of chest and foot.

His mind had been wandering to the 1920s a lot lately.
 He and Sharon had had a good time at Teri’s dance, and the stereotypical costumes—drop-waist dresses, cloche hats, raccoon coats—had made him wonder what life had been like for Marie Tranton before she’d gotten married.
 Had she gone to lots of dances and parties?
 He wondered what radio programs she’d enjoyed and if maybe she’d preferred to read.
 Sighing, Rick rose to go inside.
 He didn’t feel like being alone all day.
 Maybe he’d call Dirk and go play racquetball.
 Or maybe— He stopped and turned around, hearing footsteps.
 Footsteps?

Rodregas had made a promise to the gods and though she was the most amazing woman in the world, still he would do his duty.
 He tried to find the right thing to say.
 Rodregas looked down at her with her head on his shoulder and her pile of auburn curls spread equally over both their naked bodies.
 Her long hair covered a lot of the two of them but really hid nothing.
 He met her large green eyes and said, “You amaze me.
 I knew you were brave and courageous, but now I know where your true magic talent is...” He looked at her eyes as he spoke and even when he smiled at his own words, he let her see the sincerity of what he said.
 The main rule of flattery with women is to never lie.
 It was a lesson taught to Rodregas by a lost love, and one that had served him well over the years.
 Most women can always tell a lie, especially in such a moment of connection as the talk after good sex.
 Luckily, even with far more normal women there is always something good you can say; with Imeralda he could have gone on for hours.

“The few tombs they do build house nothing but ash.

 Qurrah nodded.

Once through both the huge gates, Rodregas, Doi’van and Imeralda came into full view of the Great Cathedral of the Heavens.
 The Cathedral served as both fortress and a temple to the Celestial Gods, and its thick walls were a balance of the practical and the artistic.
 Its towering white walls were adorned with statues and engravings.
 Above the ground floor were huge stained glass windows and arches and on the heights were a series of small towers and domes.
 Rodregas had forgotten how striking the building was and all three stood to admire it for a long moment before moving forward into the inner courtyard.
 In front of the Cathedral set a grandly engraved table of gleaming oak which looked to be more suitable for the dining hall of a noble than in the great courtyard.
 The three men behind the table were clearly Knight Captains of the Order; behind them stood young squires eager to be of service at the word of the knights.
 The knighthood was split into two grand divisions; those with minor sigils who were simply Knights of the Order, and Knights’ Captains, who had gained the greater sigils.
 From their ranks was chosen the Grand Master of the Order, the physical and spiritual leader of the Order of the Soaring Heavens.
 Rodregas’ eyes fell on a man who sat in a beautiful carved chair, a match for the table that sat just behind the knights.

“Goes down easy, I say,” the guard said to the bowman.
 “How much you want to bet this guy is the sick bastard killing the kids?”
 “How much you wanna bet we can hang him even if he isn’t?” the other asked.
 Both guards laughed, and the sickness in Harruq’s gut grew.
 A boot kicked his stomach, and he knew his patience was near its end.
 Visions of ripping out entrails filled his mind, and all his willpower kept him crouched there.
 A kick to the face forced him over, and he reached for the impact point along his cheek.
 A sword hilt quickly found his exposed chest.
 Rolling over only shifted the next few blows to his back.
 When the heel of a boot crushed down on his kidney, Harruq felt ready to slaughter, no longer caring if he was caught or killed.

He stood there and seemed unmoved from being soaked by my water gun.
 His face was blank and he was staring at nothing.
 It wasn’t the Seth I was friends with.
 While Emily and Jason were bickering I said, “Seth?” Seth didn’t answer.
 He acted like he didn’t hear me.
 “Seth?
 Hello earth to Seth,” I repeated.
 No answer again.
 “Seth is there something wrong?” I whispered.
 He didn’t answer me again.

“So,” I said and wiped the sweat off my knife's handle, “that was something, wasn't it?” Emily put her hands on her hips.
 “Jazell, how the heck did you know how to kill those things?” She shook her head.
 “What were those things?” “Syphons,” I said.
 “I don't know how I knew where to stab them.
 I just did, alright?
 It was weird.” Seth shook his head and leaned against a tree.
 “How come you get some random power when the rest of us don't?” He gave me a fake pout.
 “It's not fair.” I leaned against the tree next to him and rammed my elbow into his side.
 He winced and I grinned.
 “I didn't ask for the power, Seth.

As they stood protecting me, the betrayal I’d felt before was gone.
 In its place was a new hurt, a heart-rending sorrow.
 They heard my sobs.
 I was aware of their eyes on me before they uncomfortably turned away again.
 Chevelle approached me warily as I lay curled in a ball on my blankets, the book positioned in front of me.
 He tossed it aside but I no longer cared.
 He sat behind me and pulled me into his arms, holding me as I wept.
 It was more right than anything had been in a long, long time.

I told her I would call her when I returned and after work hours.
 She agreed and the call ended.
 At the time, I didn’t understand why we didn’t just go do the deal right away, but the cops needed to get a crew together and do all this planning for the bust.
 Once this part of the deal was confirmed, the officer left the room and returned with a stack of documents for me to sign.
 I didn’t read much of it because it didn’t really matter what it said.
 They were the documents that they needed to cover their asses, period!
 Two nervous days passed before I got the go-ahead and a time and location for the drug deal.
 I was instructed to call Ashley and tell her the time but not to commit to the location.
 The police wanted the time to set up the area of the bust location and they did not want the drug dealer to come early and perhaps see them preparing.

His arms and legs bulged with muscle.
 He flexed his arm and stared at the growth that traveled all the way up to his neck.
 He felt within himself a lifewell of energy, one infinitely deep.
 “Discard your swords, Harruq,” Velixar said.
 “You are the protector of my disciple.
 You deserve better.”
 He slid his two swords out from their sheaths, stunned by the ease in which he moved them.
 It was if they went from being made of steel to air.
 He tossed them aside.

 Her hand then traveled to his shoulder, and a deep frown grew across her face.

Rodregas raised his hand up in a peaceful motion.
 She probably had nowhere else to go.
 He ignored her and went to the cabinets and the cold box.
 He got out cheese and bread, found some fruit and had a good simple meal.
 He would need to pack as much food as possible for his journey.
 The old kitchen drudge was still peeling the same potato when he left the kitchen.
 Freshly fed and feeling better for it, Rodregas went across the main hall and entered the door opposite the kitchen into the barracks section of the keep.
 The place was about as messy as he had ever seen it; the normal tidiness demanded by Captain Poir had apparently been put aside in excitement over the chance to take some time off for the celebration.
 His personal bunk and trunk were a mess.
 His good blanket was missing, as was his spare pair of boots and most of his other belongings.

“Where were you during the commotion?” she repeated.
 “I’d think if you were at Junnie’s, you’d have known all about it.

 “Well,” I said, “Junnie sent me home early because I learned a spell.” Fannie looked incredulous, so I backpedaled.
 “Well, not a spell, but I grew a… flower.
 And then I was so excited I was going to run home and tell you… but I took the back way and then…” I swallowed.
 “Well, and then I got lost.
 Sorry.” Aunt Fannie was incensed, her curses flying out in a rant that felt as if it would never end.
 The years of listening to it seemed to coalesce, and I was suddenly exhausted.

Chevelle was across the fire.
 He looked up at me through his lashes, past his furrowed brow, and then brought me a piece of meat.
 It was cold.
 I sat stunned.
 Had they nothing to say?
 Had they actually not known?
 I wanted to scream, but the words wouldn’t come.
 I was too drained.
 And I was scared.
 I didn’t know what had happened, what was wrong with me, but I was certain whatever it was, Chevelle would take me straight back to the village.

The aim of the plan is to reduce food imports to zero and eliminate food shortages within three to five years.
 The plan requires acquisition of foreign production and storage technology, but depends only marginally on import of equipment, most of which can be manufactured in domestic defence facilities.
 The hard currency requirement is minimal.
 But the plan does re quire a leading role by government and financial assistance to farms.
 In order to be effective, it needs to be supported by a massive public education campaign on use of new technology to eradicate crop losses combined with demonstration plots on both large-scale and small private farms throughout the country.
 The Commission recommends immediate implementation of the plan with the objective of improving the agricultural economy, increasing the food supply and completely eliminating dependence on food imports.
 4.Study benefits of economic union: Of the estimated 50 per cent fall in GDP among the republics of the former Soviet Union, approximately half can be attributed to the break-up of the economic union.
 Restoration of a common economic space – which is being criticized internationally as a surrender of sovereignty to Russia at a time when both Western Europe and North America are striving for closer economic union – could immediately restore most of that lost output.
 The advantages of cooperation between republics needs to be care fully examined.

He stopped crying and I felt him squirm.
 Seth grunted and then mumbled, “Get off me.” “No, not until you tell me what’s going on,” I said.
 He groaned.
 “Seriously Jazell, nothing is wrong.

 “You’re a horrible liar Seth.” “I know,” I felt him sigh.
 “Please Jazell it’s nothing you need to worry about, okay?

 “Don't you dare think about killing him.
 He got us here-” “And he's leaving us here in some random place when we have no clue what to do or where we're going,” Seth interrupted me.
 The dwarf shook his head.
 “I'm very sorry, sir, but her majesty told me to bring you here and then to report back.

Before we really all felt the power.
 The War was just this endless one-note playing over and over and driving us insane—me insane, sorry, driving me insane.
 And, like, I know that a song is just a song—yet, I have to believe there is something there, an element, a catalytically charged element.
 I didn’t want religion—who listens to priests, clergymen, even those who take to the streets?

 Ali reaches more people.
 But a song, you know, a good song, well, it does tunnel deep into the consciousness.

“But I know I don’t like it and will not accept it.
 Ever.
 Is that clear?”
 “Yeah,” Harruq said.
 “Now will you let me down?”
 For a moment, she said nothing, catching her breath and doing her best to calm the flood of adrenaline that still rushed through her.
 Harruq twisted against the vines, but they still held firm.
 Blood continued to trickle down his chin.
 “I’m not blind,” she said, suddenly looking away.

 The first week of training went well for both Harruq and Aurelia.
 The half-orc kept on the offensive, determined not to add a fresh set of bruises to his body.
 Aurelia still fell for the feints, however slow, but her blocks were already quicker and more precise.
 They fought until both collapsed against trees, sweat soaking their bodies.
 “You’re starting to get the hang of it,” Harruq said after their fifth session.
 “Don’t flatter me,” Aurelia said, refastening one of her braids that had come loose.
 “You’re still going too easy.”

 Sometime before dark I left and wandered alone, toward and up a hill called Eastridge that overlooked our school, along a street of vacant lots, sometimes escaping into in my usual obsessions about Karen Flagstad or whether I should play baseball or golf that spring.

Rodregas had no moral grounds on which to kill these men, but inside of him there was no mercy.
 He had crossed a line and could no longer live with the evil.
 Rodregas let go of the guard’s shield.
 He did not have the angle to grab his opponent’s throat.
 Instead he had to grab the man’s lower face which was exposed by the half helm, and then he squeezed.
 Rodregas felt the guard’s face give way to his rage and unnatural strength.
 For a moment the guard struggled to escape his hold, but Rodregas pulled him closer with one hand and with the other ripped his opponent’s face away.
 Rodregas felt a stab in his back as he took either an arrow or a sword.
 He was groggy with pain, and both weak and filled with rage.
 The guard in his hands was thrashing and spasming in unspeakable pain.

He looked like some kind of pagan god, smeared all over with blood, an uneven circle drawn on his chest, filled with sharp, angry lines that didn't mean anything to me, but which made the wolves around me tense and growl.
 "While I appreciate the sentiment, it really is far too late to secure absolution by bringing me the girl."
 His voice had changed, becoming deeper and harsher, with elements that didn't sound like they could come from any human throat.
 He stepped forward, and I felt my chest seize up.
 The transformation I'd sensed the beginnings of at the dance had run its course now and any question as to why someone as cultured as Brandon would associate with a near-psychopath like Vincent was put to rest.
 He was shaking now, quivering with the need to kill, and I realized that it didn't matter whether the darkness inside Brandon had created Vincent or just attracted him to orbit in his sphere like a small moon.
 It was enough to know that Vincent's was the lesser evil.

It only took a moment to realize what I’d done.
 I picked up the pace as Aunt Fannie’s curses came screaming through the closed door.
 She was determined not to let me forget what a burden it had been to take me in, even if it used every spare ounce of energy to do it.
 My mouth twisted, and I shifted into a run until I reached the little outcropping of rock on the west side of the village.
 I was still thinking about it when I slowed to climb through the tangle of brush in back of Junnie’s house, but once my fingers trailed the cool rock surrounding the structure, it fell away.
 When it felt as if I could breathe again, I rapped two quick knocks and then one loud knock on the small wooden door.
 It was the one sure way she’d know it was me.
 A wisp of bright blonde hair swirled around Junnie’s shining eyes as the door swung open, and I decided I must have caught her working; she looked flustered.
 Junnie was older than I, but remained striking with the blonde hair, blue eyes, and thin features that seemed to be standard-issue among the village elves.
 The Council had assigned her as my tutor, citing my advanced age as the reason I couldn’t learn with the others, but I suspected it was my stunning lack of ability that had landed me here.

Maybe it led to the divorce, I don’t know the details.

No curious investigators arrived, however, and they continued with their dark deed.
 When the blood dripping from the elf’s wounds became but a trickle, they filled the hole and moved on.
 Using the clothes and robes from upstairs, the two brothers wiped away as much of Ahrqur’s blood as they could.
 They tossed the bloody clothes, the table, and the pieces of glass they into the fireplace and burned them.
 Harruq wrapped the body in spare blankets he found in a closet.
 “Grab the sword,” he said as he hoisted the dead elf onto his shoulder.
 “I have it,” Qurrah said, retrieving the elven blade and its dark green sheath from the floor.
 They gave one last look around.
 Everything was back in place.

And then, at once, the group began to scratch at themselves feverishly, clawing at forearms, abdomens, and necks.
 Each wore an uncomfortable, even frightened, expression as they hurried out of the room and into an inner Council chamber.
 I was considering the strangeness of it as I made my way through the now-vacant room, but was distracted by the sight of the library door.
 I had no way of knowing if there would be a protection spell on the entry.
 When I walked through, there were no obvious repercussions and I assumed that, with so many Council members around, they must not have thought it necessary.
 The Council library was overwhelming.
 It housed copies of all the books in the village library as well as hundreds more that were too delicate or important for public use.
 And if you believed Fannie’s theories, they held secret documents here as well, things they didn’t want commonly known.
 The walls were stark white, like carved marble, and the room felt cold and empty, despite the abundance inside.
 I found a shelf to hide behind and placed my pilfered documents on the floor.

When I did get home there was usually a gathering of my roommates and their friends.
 Pot smoke always filled the air.
 The family room had an array of donated couches and chairs and beanbags gathered by the roommates and friends.
 A long curled phone cord hung from the center of the ceiling with a roach clip taped to it.
 This was a convenient way to pass a joint around the room without ever leaving your chair.
 The clip swung from smoker to smoker.
 I got up and went to school early the next day, and then my daily routine would repeat itself.
 Somehow I willed myself to stick it out at school despite my surroundings and the influences of my peers.

It forces higher-wage countries and their workers to specialize in technology-intensive and skill-intensive occupations that pay higher wages.
 At the same time, it also raises the wages of less-skilled jobs in low-wage countries by increasing the demand for workers to produce for overseas markets.
 The problem in the more developed countries is that the demand for low-skilled jobs declines and the gap in wages between skilled and unskilled jobs tends to increase, resulting in a decline in incomes and employment opportunities for lower levels of the population in these countries.
 This is a natural, healthy process of social development in which different sectors serve as engines for growth at different stages.
 The upward job displacement that earlier shifted job opportunities from agriculture to industry now shifts them to higher-skilled jobs in manufacturing and services.
 The negative side-effects of this process on some sections of the population alert us to areas where society must make special efforts to speed their development.
 As in the case of technology, research is needed to document this complex process across industries, between countries and over time.
 One product of these studies could be the development of specific job coefficients measuring the impact of growth in trade in different industries on overall employment.
 Trade becomes of even greater potential benefit to industrial nations during the coming decade when economic growth in these countries is expected to be significantly slower than in the developing world.
 The pent-up demand generated by the destruction of Europe during the Second World War, the rapid expansion of population during the baby boom generation, and the explosion of new technologies in the past few decades, all generated strong internal demand in the OECD countries, resulting in steady economic growth.

Actual gains could be very much higher.
 These subsidies cost Western consumers several hundred billion dollars annually.
 In addition, they lead to dumping of surplus sugar, cereal, milk and beef in developing countries, often pushing down the prices which farmers in these countries receive for their produce to far below their production cost.
 The benefits of eliminating these subsidies would be multiple.
 For instance, eliminating subsidies to sugar-beet growers and dairy farmers in Europe would stimulate greater demand, not only for imported sugar from developing countries, but also for cocoa, which combined with sugar and milk is the basis for the chocolate industry.
 Measures of this type will result in substantially increased demand for agricultural products from developing countries, the first step in an upward spiral of global economic growth that will stimulate industrial exports and job growth in both East and West.
 2.Global, environmentally sustainable Green Revolution.
 The term 'Green Revolution' has been praised for its positive impact on crop productivity and criticized for its likely adverse effects on the environment and social equity.
 It is often overlooked that one of the most beneficial consequences of the Green Revolution has been its 'forest-saving' nature.
 If agricultural production had not been increased through higher productivity, more forest land would have been diverted to annual cropping.

 You have a job where you wear your name on your shirt.
 Eugene – You don’t do all that well when you’re at school, and it’s not like you’re going to some high class college, you’re at a low end public university.
 Johnny – And when was the last time you had a date with a woman?
 Eugene – I don’t think it has been any time in recent years.
 Johnny – It’s been a long time.
 Jim – You’re questioning my love life?
 Johnny, you’ve never had a date in your life, and some times I doubt that you ever will.
 And Gene, well I don’t know where to start with you, the last time you went out with someone was during that week that you thought you might be gay.
 Now I’m not an experienced judge of what makes another guy attractive, but I would have to say that your date was the single ugliest man I’ve ever seen in my life.

B., for Furry, for Gatemouth.
 There’s this cat, Beaureguard somebody, played his whole life, man, his whole fucking life, lived in Midtown Memphis, played all the gigs there were back then—and we’re talking back in the Ur days, the days before electricity.
 And he lived to be, oh I don’t know, 117 or something ridiculous.
 Never made it, you know, never cut a record for Chess or whoever.
 But the music was important, it flowed through him, this cat.
 I saw him once, in a tent show—Furry was there—and he just blew everybody away, played with a broken bottle for a slide, old shitbox guitar—and he just blew everybody away.
 He’s in here man, in me, in all the cats who came after.
 That’s Memphis.

 “I’m Noble.” Now I was confused.

On that spot, Singhelm the Strong and Ceredon Sinistel, leaders of Neldar’s troops and the Erzen elves, respectively, had made a pact that a city could exist between the two races without bloodshed.
 Singhelm had long since passed away, while Ceredon remained, two hundred years older, as the leader of the elven elite Ekreissar.
 It was in that clearing Antonil halted his army.
 The men shuffled around nervously, their eyes searching for enemies that always seemed to be hiding beyond their vision.
 The guard captain unrolled the edict, his gut sinking as he realized where he stood.
 Long ago, man and elf had agreed to live together in peace.
 Now, on that very same spot, he would rescind that agreement.
 Beyond the clearing loomed several palisades.

I released the tube and turned slowly toward Fannie.
 She was livid, red-faced and shaking.
 She stepped toward me, and I slid the pouch that lay against my leg behind my sash.
 She didn’t seem to notice.
 The blow was quick, and I hadn’t seen it coming.
 My head turned with the contact, whipping back toward her before I had a chance to rein in the shock and anger.
 Fannie’s eyes lit with anticipation.
 Like she wanted me to fight back.
 I had never even talked back to Fannie.

"Nope, not sick."
 After such a beginning, my day could hardly be anything but great.

 I couldn't remember the second phase of cell division in Biology.
 I'd forgotten to reread the last chapter of Wuthering Heights, and Britney went out of her way to snub me.
 The only thing I cared about was making it to lunch so I could see Brandon again.
 I dawdled on my way to Algebra, so much so I was nearly late for class.
 It wasn't until I sat down at my desk and felt a wave of disappointment slither through me that I realized I'd been hoping to see Brandon in between classes.

He'd always been gorgeous.
 I could dislike, even hate him, and still acknowledge that he made my heart go pitter-patter, but this was something else.
 He looked so happy, so at peace with the world, that for the brief moment between when I saw him and when I recognized him, I thought I'd seen an angel.
 I'd always thought that intense look of concentration was the sign of a true artist.
 Maybe it still was.
 Maybe whatever he was drawing was absolute crap.
 Maybe the masters like Michelangelo and da Vinci had completed their greatest works with expressions very similar to what everyone else in the class was sporting.
 Still, I couldn't help envy such contentment.

This one runs underground before coming out in this small valley.
 I was trying to find the ley line again.
 That is how I found the old farmhouse.” Ley lines are like rivers of magic energy that encircle the world.
 Most major Immortalist keeps and other magic locations are located either on one, or where two of them cross.
 Magicians love them for all the free magical power just flowing by to use.
 But while there is plenty of power it is not easy to use.
 The power is naturally full of disturbances and chaotic energies.
 The horror stories of magicians having terrible accidents with spells gone crazy on ley lines were legend.
 This is why Immortalists used circles to manage the power.
 Raven Keep was on such a line but you could not feel it due to the powerful circles built into the tower.

Over the last half century, national sovereignty has been maturing into international sovereignty.
 As the evolution of the international community proceeds towards the establishment of an effective system of world governance in one form or another, the collective rights of the international community of nations must inevitably come to be regarded as another inalienable truth, alongside individual human rights and the rights of each nation.
 The right of the nation state to self-determination has to accommodate the rights of other nations and the common shared rights of every human being.
 This approach establishes criteria for determining when claims of national sovereignty must be ignored.
 Every right is accompanied by a responsibility.
 A government that fosters external aggression or cannot contain domestic violence and civil strife, that cannot create conditions in which its people can feed themselves or even receive outside assistance, fails the test of sovereignty.
 Under these circumstances, the international community, through the UN, should have the right and accept the responsi bility to intervene appropriately.
 The need of the hour is not to undermine the legitimate right of nations to self-determination, but rather to protect that right by more clearly demarcating its legitimate boundaries against the highly visible challenges being posed by forces of disintegration and fragmentation from within.
 The current tendency for states to fragment along ethnic lines cannot be handled by any abstract principle of international law.
 It depends on the understanding and will of people.

Qurrah watched him for a moment before speaking.
 “You know what you must do, should it come to it,” he said.

My head was throbbing so bad I blacked out for a moment, and missed the end of the fight.
 When I opened my eyes back up, the indistinct shadow was moving smoothly towards me.
 I opened my mouth to thank him, and then felt as though my world had been pulled out from underneath me.
 The shadow went from my savior to a nightmarish being.
 It was easily eight feet tall, covered in thick fur, and had bloody claws as long as my hands tipping the ends of its fingers.
 My vision was still swimming enough that I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing.
 Even so, there was no way to ignore the bloodstained mouth as it got closer.
 I had a moment to realize I was still going to die all alone, and then the blackness came for me.

These men had won athletic contests and were known for their incredible physical gifts, good looks and sharp wits.
 Ravenhurr tested them for strength, reflexes and dexterity.
 Those that succeeded were further tested for the sharpness of their senses, their intelligence and ability to learn new languages.
 The winner of these tests was rewarded with having his soul and mind ripped out and made into a piece of meat to be filled with the mind, personality, and the very soul of Ravenhurr himself.
 However, this time, instead of Ravenhurr, his old guard sergeant had ended up as a new powerful Immortalist.
 As the cold of the stone chilled his back Rodregas thought about his promise to the Celestial Gods that if he were able to kill Ravenhurr and live, then his new duty would be to fight the Immortalists.
 When all and everyone else had failed him over the years, only his duty had kept Rodregas alive.
 He no longer knew what to do without it.

He left his mother to straighten out his bills while he went to do a drug deal.
 Unbelievable.
 He was supposed to bring drugs to a hotel room, but because Brandon owed everybody money, his credit to be fronted drugs was not good, so he went to the drug deal without the drugs, planning to get the money first then go back for them.
 When Brandon knocked on the hotel room door, it opened and an army of police officers darting in from all directions greeted him.
 They wrestled him to the ground, cuffed him and began their search of him and his vehicle and, later, his house.
 Brandon had been recorded agreeing to the deal and he had paraphernalia in his possession.
 Unfortunately for the police, they chose to drop the net on him when he had hit bottom and couldn’t afford the drugs they hoped they would catch him with.
 During his 23-hour period in jail, the narcotics officers shook him down for everything he was worth.
 The process of getting one drug dealer to set up the next is as old as the trade itself (my own brother had done it over 35 years before).
 During the interrogation, which included the usual scare tactics, the cops showed him a great deal of information they had collected on him.

Such abrupt changes have been observed previously in industrial societies only during times of war.
 Infant mortality is rising in many of the countries.
 Not surprisingly, there have been increasing indications of public discontent and voter dissatisfaction with the course of the reforms in the vast majority of countries.
 Simultaneous Shocks
 The collapse of the East European and Central Asian economies from 1990 to 1994 resulted from their exposure to a series of simultaneous shocks.
 1.Stabilization and adjustments: The majority of countries, having suffered from inflation and balance of payments problems in the 1980s, applied sharp stabilization and adjustment programmes in the early 1990s to stop inflation, balance budgets, and close balance of payments gaps, while at the same time liberalizing prices in order to correct major price distortions.
 These deflationary policies led, in most cases, to sharp declines in output.
 2.Resource allocation: Sudden dismantling of the central planning machinery responsible for the allocation of materials for current production and allocation of funds and materials for investment in these countries was another shock.
 It proved impossible in the majority of countries to create and organize, overnight, commodity and financial markets of sufficient depth and flexibility to substitute effectively for the planning machinery.
 3.Import liberalization: Drastic import liberalization led to the inflow of better-quality, lower-priced foreign goods that depressed demand for domestically produced goods.

 He couldn’t have been much older than I, but his hands dwarfed mine and it made me feel suddenly, fleetingly, like a child again.
 A spark lit at the hem of my left sleeve and slowly worked its way up my arm.
 I wanted the fire off me, needed it put out.
 When I concentrated on that, the flame flickered.
 It flared again and Chevelle squeezed my hands; I had to be able to do this.
 I focused hard on the base of the flame as it wavered and then fell back toward the hem, where it finally choked off.

 I’ve got a bunch more to learn.” The last couple months of that summer, while I smashed golf balls, played baseball in Mexico on Sundays, and visited my cousins in Pacific Beach, Eric ran around with Margaret Beasley, Pam Greenman, and Lane Campbell.
 Margaret had been my friend longer than anyone except my cousins.
 Since second grade.
 All through elementary school, she was always the smartest in class, and kinder than anybody else I knew.
 She spent eighth grade in my mom's English and Social Studies class.
 Later my mom called her the brightest student she ever taught.
 And her pure and soulful singing would land her, only months after high school, on a weekly television show with a folk group, The Good Time Singers.
 That summer before our senior year, Margaret's best friend was Pam Greenman, who attended our rival high school.

 I managed to just give her a smile, and hold off on the tears until I'd gathered up my stuff and made it out of the room.
 Rachel caught up with me before I made it very far.
 "Adriana, are you okay?
 Don't you want a ride home?"
 I turned towards her to respond and just broke down.
 She pulled me into an open classroom and gave me a hug while I tried to explain about the two failed tests, my birthday, and how much I missed my Dad and Cindi.
 The last bit was especially garbled.
 I was pretty sure she wasn't getting any of it, but that didn't matter.
 All that mattered was I was finally able to tell someone.

"Nobody is unbeatable, but yes, that's why Brandon is such a formidable adversary.
 His gift is more prosaic than most, it's just increased strength and speed, but that makes him more than a match for most normal hybrids."
 "That's why Alec had more food than normal dropped off here then?
 Because he really doesn't think he can win?"
 Mallory pondered for several seconds, before finally shrugging.
 "That may be unduly pessimistic.
 He's detail-oriented enough that part of it's probably just an insurance policy for me in case he doesn't prevail, but there is a kernel of truth to your concern.
 Alec is an incredible fighter, but Brandon's like hasn't been seen in centuries."
 "Why are you telling me all this?
 I've been with the others for almost two whole weeks, and nobody's hinted that there were hybrids with special powers."

She nuzzled the elf and snorted something.
 “You worry too much, old girl,” Dieredon said, his voice cracking several times.

 “Half.

 “A heavy price,” Dieredon said, gingerly climbing atop Sonowin.
 “Heavy, but well worth its weight in blood.

The evening became an in vino veritas experience.
 After some cups, he said, “Ken, you should know it was me that hounded my son into serving in Vietnam.” I held back from saying, Yeah, I know.
 “So he goes over there, fighting in a war that was all wrong, and he saw things nobody should have to.
 He comes back drinking hard.
 And then, thank God, he met Toni.” The man from whom Cliff and Bill Torrey inherited their reserved and stoic characters snuffed and wiped his eyes.
 “I’ll tell you, that girl saved my son’s life.
 She dressed him down when he needed it, kicked him out when she knew it was best, and took him back as soon as he deserved it.
 I can’t tell you how much I owe that girl.” Toni teaches nursing at Cuesta College.
 She knows most everything about nutrition and raising kids.
 Before Cliff and I go out to slug golf balls into the trees, Toni and I talk in the kitchen.

“Gah, that tastes like cat pee smells.” Chevelle chuckled.
 “It will help with the healing.” Why bother?
 I wondered.
 It would be another day of bombardment with mountain fixtures… maybe whole trees this time.
 My face pinched with annoyance and Chevelle threw me a piece of dried meat, barely holding back a smile as he jumped on his horse.
 “You’d better get started,” he said, “it’s going to be a long walk.” As he kicked his heels, I spun toward the corner where my horse had been.
 He was galloping up the mountain now, just over a hundred yards away.
 I tried to think quickly, to keep the anger from slowing my response.
 Using magic to pull Chevelle’s horse by the tail, I ran after him, hoping to leap on.
 A tree branch came from nowhere and smacked me flat across the face.

 I fought panic as I wondered if they’d all made it.
 The worry throbbed in my head; it felt like my mind could splinter.

 Ruby’s smile was soft.
 “How do you feel?” I was having trouble forming a simple answer.
 There didn’t seem to be a word for it in the disorder of my brain.
 My silence was answer enough.
 “It will pass.” I hoped she was right.
 Chevelle was watching me, anxious now.

I waited until he turned back around before I whispered, “Ruby, did you bring the magic book with you?” She smiled.
 “Can I read it?” She winked at me.
 I started to share her grin, but before I could, Chevelle was in front of us, his horse blocking my way.
 I was almost thrown from my saddle when we stopped to avoid running into him.
 He was angry again.
 “Frey.” “What?” “Do you remember the last time you used a spell?” I recalled the smell of burning flesh as the maps cut into my palms.
 “Yes,” I muttered, defeated.
 The look he gave Ruby was clear.
 There would be no magic study for me.

 I finally just settled on faking a smile and thanking her.
 She smiled at me.
 "No need to thank me.

The Commandment
 A song reminds me of 1 John 3:23, “This is his commandment, to believe in the name of his son, Jesus, and to love one another as he commanded us.” Again I think about the power of a single word to change us, and redirect our lives, and perhaps give us the ability to change others and the world.
 But I suspect it’s not likely to do so unless we stop and wrestle with its meanings.
 In an essay on writing short stories, Andre Dubus advised that when we get stuck, instead of stopping or attempting to go forward, we should try going deeper.
 On this trip, I have attempted to deepen my understanding of the word “adore.” Now I’m trying to do the same with some words in John’s admonition, because I feel my mind or the Spirit telling me that everything we need to know to live in goodness and beauty may be contained in those few lines.
 John tells us to “believe in” the name of the Son.
 While at a glance this could be taken to mean we should simply believe that Jesus existed, it doesn’t.
 Because “believe in” denotes more than credulity.
 “Believe in” means to fully trust.
 And here we’re not called to believe in “Him” but to believe in His name.

Thus92m I0m point out that the text below was written in order to distinguish us from Him.92m Trust0m is not an end itself, but the ability to admit92m that0m we must “do our best in the name of the Lord Jesus, if you will.<eop><eod> The

9.Disseminate information: Encourage the establishment of new institutions, programmes and systems to speed and extend the dissemination of practically useful information as a powerful catalyst for more rapid social progress.
 Encourage a national climate of open-mindedness to foreign ideas, influences and success stories.
 10.Increase the velocity of money and other transactions: Increase the speed of commercial transactions, especially money flows, in the economy by streamlining government and banking procedures, ensuring rapid utilization of funds by all government agencies, setting strict limits on the time taken for bank transfers, introducing agencies for credit verification and collection of unpaid bills, and improving the telecommunications infrastructure.
 11.Revamp higher education: Educational systems which 'manufacture graduates' compound the problem rather than alleviating it.
 The problem of the educated unemployed is not so much the amount of education they receive, but the type of knowledge and attitudes imparted.
 Reorient the educational curriculum at all levels, especially higher education, to impart the knowledge and attitudes needed to promote self-employment and entrepreneur ship rather than salaried employment.
 12.Employment planning: Studies of Japan and the NIEs indicate that conscious employment planning is an essential requirement for generating full employment.
 Place the employment objective high on the national agenda and evolve a comprehensive plan to achieve full employment by identifying untapped growth potentials in agriculture, industry, exports and services.

"What's the matter, afraid I'll be jealous?"
 I shook my head, fighting the urge to look back down.
 "No, there isn't anything to be jealous of.
 I'd never been on a single date before Sanctuary, and you know all about what's happened since I arrived."
 His smile was surprisingly reassuring.
 "That sounds like the easiest one I've asked you yet.
 Why the sudden bashfulness?"
 My throat seemed to be spending an awful lot of the time lately constricted down to the point where speech was all but impossible.
 It was even worse than usual now.

"Of course I knew.
 It isn't like I could do anything about that.
 I've never led her on, but I've always been aware she liked me."
 There didn't seem to be much else to be said, so I thanked Brandon again for the ride into school, and headed off to my home room.
 Everyone had pretty much just pretended like I didn't exist before.
 Now, with Brandon having taken an interest in me, I got everything from simple acknowledgment of my presence to obvious dislike, and even a couple of people who looked like they wanted to take Britney's place.
 I suppose some people would have been thrilled by the chance to join the top of the social food chain, but it mostly just disgusted me.
 I politely rebuffed the scavengers, ignored the haters, and carefully acknowledged the rest without giving them anything else to go on.
 It was a rather depressing exercise.
 By the time Mrs. Sorenson had fired a couple of ridiculously obscure questions at me, I found the good feelings I'd managed to carry away from the mayor's visit the night before had pretty much evaporated.

He went back to his office and read the article again.
 He should have shown it to Marie before he’d fallen in love with her.
 But he was afraid to tell her he’d known of her before she’d walked into the garden.
 What if she thought he’d done something to cause it?
 Marie was growing increasingly frustrated with the books she was reading.
 There were all kinds of theories about how to travel through time, but there was absolutely nothing that could explain how she’d traveled through time.
 She hadn’t gotten in a time machine, hadn’t been near a dead star, hadn’t been thinking about 2011.
 That was another thing—most of the articles talked about traveling back in time, not forward.
 How could she have been thinking about 2011 when she knew nothing about it?
 She picked up a book with a chapter on traveling through time by thought.

 She gave him a small smile, but when they reached the yogurt stand, she said that she didn't want any.

 "Do you want to watch TV?"

I told her you'd be back soon, but she's worried."

 For the first time since I'd found out about Alec's secret, Rachel was looking uncertain.
 She was suddenly the old Rachel I knew from school instead of the confident young woman who'd helped face down three terrifying shape shifters intent on sending me back to Brandon.
 "Are you sure, Alec?
 I could go help her get settled into the Lilac Room."
 Alec's smile was gentle.

After Spanish, Jasmin had escorted me to Mrs. Campbell's class.
 Telling her I wasn't going to be able to help out at the lab anymore had been one of the harder things I'd ever done, but she'd been surprisingly understanding.
 We'd scheduled my makeup test for the next day and I'd left with the sneaking suspicion she'd guessed more about what was really going on in Sanctuary than either pack would've liked.
 I'd been busy contemplating what Mrs. Campbell might have really figured out as we left the building, only to have Jasmin interrupt my musings with an apology of all things.
 She didn't get into specifics, and it was obvious she was still worried about the coming showdown with Brandon, but I was pretty sure she really was sorry.
 It didn't make us best friends and she was still an enigma, but it was a start.
 It even gave me hope maybe Jessica and James might eventually come around.
 I was still reeling in surprise as we walked out to the parking lot and met up with the rest of the pack, or rather the rest of the pack minus Alec.
 He'd shown up several minutes later, looking very satisfied with himself, but obviously unwilling to answer any questions.
 As we caravanned home, I realized the collection of vehicles carrying us back to Alec's estate probably cost more than my house.

Even though they didn’t have the bust they wanted, they had him verbally agreeing to provide drugs and several people willing to testify that Brandon had provided them with Oxy and other drugs.
 They had been monitoring him for some time and had ample surveillance to make up for the lack of drugs at his actual bust.
 Brandon had been dealing Oxy for the past few years and the police had been looking to get him.
 Brandon had at one time been moving thousands of these tiny green prescription pain pills through California, making nighttime drives to Los Angeles and back to buy huge quantities to supply the Sacramento area.
 They were charging him with three felonies and he was facing five plus years in prison.
 Faced with the charges, Brandon waved his attorney rights and talked too much— a strung out drug addict who just got popped.
 The interrogation lasted nearly twenty hours; although, to Brandon, it felt like three days.
 Faced with the abundance of evidence and the thought of five years in prison, Brandon broke and agreed to bust a dealer named Steve.
 The interesting thing about Steve was that much of the information the officers had on Brandon was from Steve.

Across the empty space before me was an elaborate table that seated six leaders of High Council.
 The guards who had brought me here were standing behind me, within arm’s reach on either side.
 Left of them were council members and, as I glanced right, Chevelle walked in to stand at attention, facing the council table.
 I could hear others enter behind us, presumably witnesses, and I wondered if Junnie was among them.
 “Elfreda Georgiana Suzetta Glaforia stands before High Council…” The formal tone of the speaker severed my rambling thoughts, dragging me back to a frightening reality.
 What would they do to me?
 How bad could the punishment be for sneaking into a library?
 And stealing a book.

I needed to stay on this path, now more than ever.
 Chevelle’s words rolled through my mind.
 He thought I wouldn’t give up because I’d seen the map.
 Something about that nagged at me, but Ruby waited while I searched for a response.
 Chevelle opened the door and I knew I was saved from at least that much.
 When he saw me, he was struck still.
 I had forgotten Ruby’s “treatments” until she squealed in delight at his response.
 He composed his face again, but she’d already marked him.
 “Oh, you like it.

Art – Humans don’t need than faith.
 Faith is just a crutch to lean upon.
 A way to convince yourself that there is some reason for all the pain and humiliation.
 Rather than grasping reality and actually doing something to help the world, people with faith just wait for luck to see them through.

International institutions must be strengthened to eradicate arms smuggling, narcotics, offshore money laundering and other criminal activities that serve as seedbeds and instruments for terrorism.
 However, no final solution to the problem of terrorism can be arrived at by force alone.
 While terrorism is frequently attributed to religion and ideology, it sprouts and thrives most readily among populations that lack opportunities for gainful employment and economic development.
 Social unrest is an expression of the upward aspiration of those who have been left out of the political and development process or who feel threatened by the rapid pace and stress of social change and inequity.
 Those who lack the opportunity or the ability to labour intensely for their own upliftment express their productive energies through the intensity of violence.
 The international community cannot afford to be silent spectators of the growing violence.
 Peace, democracy and development are inseparable and interdependent.
 Liberal democracy and economic opportunity for all are essential ingredients for winning the war against terrorism.
 Accepting the spiritual principle which tells us that there is an element of truth even in the most outrageous or misinformed viewpoint, we must not only vehemently condemn but also sincerely recognize the unaddressed issues that underpin the urge for violence.
 In this sense, terrorists crudely expose the mental insincerity prevalent in international politics.

“What reason do you have to kill me?” the elf asked.
 “Are you here for money?
 I could pay you twice the pittance you work for.”
 “Just shut up,” Harruq said, hurling Salvation across the room.
 Ahrqur leapt again.
 The sword punched through the couch and embedded in the wall.
 The half- orc gripped Condemnation in both hands, snarling as the elf launched his own offensive series.
 The elven blade glided through the air, repeatedly feinting and looping wide so that Harruq’s sword danced about for phantom blows.
 Ahrqur let out a mocking laugh, gave him an obvious feint, and then kicked high.
 The foot smashed the bottom of Harruq’s chin, the same sore part Dieredon had hit.

The elf whistled, and to the brothers’ surprise a winged horse landed on the rooftop of a nearby home.
 Its skin and mane were sparkling white.
 Dieredon bowed one last time and then leapt into the air, using the ledge of a window to swing himself onto the roof.
 He mounted his horse, patted her side, and then took off into the night.
 “Damn it all!” Antonil shouted, slamming his mailed fist into the wall.
 Still shaking his head, he stormed back to the gate, muttering curses.
 “What was that all about?” Harruq asked.
 “King Vaelor asked for aid and the elves declined,” Qurrah answered, chuckling.
 “The King’s pride will not take too kindly to that.”

 It was obvious that whatever magical ability had allowed Rachel to face down the larger boy wasn't working anymore.
 He looked like he was set for a monster fight.

 It was hard to believe this was the same person I'd had to rescue from Cassie so recently.
 I stopped Rachel just before she could put the impressive lungful of air she'd just taken in to whatever use she'd planned.

The three of us escaped around the office building, down the front steps to the street, where we ran into Laura.
 Though in four years she would become my wife, I hardly knew her and didn’t realize yesterday was her birthday.
 She asked me to sit on the grass for a minute.
 Staring across the ball fields, she said, “Just last week he promised that for my birthday he was going to give me a very special present, only I wouldn’t understand it for a long, long time.
 So he goes and gets killed on my birthday.
 What’s that mean?” I shrugged.
 We hugged stiffly.
 Then we parted and went our own ways.

 He slid his two swords out from their sheaths, stunned by the ease in which he moved them.

 Velixar pulled from within his cloak a chest the size of a small stone.
 He placed it on the grass where it shone gold in the light of the stars.
 As the two brothers watched, he whispered a few words of magic, enlarging the chest to normal size.
 “Over the centuries, I have gathered many items to aid those who would swear their lives to me,” Velixar said.
 The locks clicked open, the lid raised, and then he reached inside and pulled out two swords sheathed in gleaming obsidian.

 Qurrah did not know what to say or do as he watched his master die.
 His entire world had just come crashing down in the darkness.
 Above him were more than fifty elves, each one eager to bury an arrow in his back.
 “Harruq,” he said, crawling amid the bodies.
 He desperately hoped none would spot him.
 He reached a large stinking corpse lying on its back with a golden arrow in its forehead.
 Qurrah shoved the cadaver onto its side, curled underneath, and then let it fall atop him.
 The weight crushed his fragile body and the smell was awful, but it was his only cover.

It would take a real heartless individual to abandon their own family.
 My anger buffered me just enough to think about Cindi without the usual consequences, but I still wasn't really in top form.
 I was halfway through my class before I realized Mr. Simms had been shooting me dark looks for the last twenty minutes.
 They weren't the obvious nasty looks that kids shoot each other of course.
 They were subtle and infrequent but there was something about the set of his mouth that made it clear he wasn't pleased I was in his class.
 I shrugged it all off and gutted my way through class, eagerly planning what I'd say to Alec when I saw him in physics, only when I finally stalked into Mrs. Alexander's class Alec wasn't sitting in his corner desk.
 I pulled out my notes and started reviewing what I'd managed to learn about our project, stalling until he arrived so I could give him a piece of my mind.
 Only he never walked through the door.
 I still had my anger, but it wasn't cushioning me as well for some reason.
 It felt like another attack was on the way.

He looked down at my ankle and then smiled with a hint of mischievousness.
 "I suppose dancing is out, but I think I've got something that'll do just about as well."
 Alec carefully picked me up before I could respond.
 A few seconds later we were outside, traveling through the darkness with a breakneck speed that would've been suicidal with merely human vision.
 I was completely lost by the time we came around a corner and my inferior eyes were finally able to see the first hints of light up ahead.
 Alec slowed, to prolong the suspense as we got closer.
 Even so, it was only a few more steps before the grotto materialized out of the darkness before us.
 I'd thought it'd been breathtaking two weeks ago bathed in the light of the full moon.
 I'd been amazed at its lush beauty the couple of times I'd snuck back during the daylight.

 “King Vaelor cowers at the very thought of an elf,” Qurrah said.
 “The rest of the city despises us for the orc within me.
 I will punish all of their ignorance.”

I almost refused to believe my eyes when I came around the bend in our lane and saw a black Mustang parked on the side of the road.
 Brandon stood up from where he'd been leaning against the sports car and flashed me a blinding smile.
 He moved towards me with a casual grace that made little shivers run through me despite my earlier decision not to let his interest, or lack thereof, affect me.
 "I had a bet with myself that you weren't going to wait.
 Somehow the fact I just lost doesn't matter now."
 It didn't seem possible he was talking to me, that anyone so gorgeous could mean something like that about me.
 I opened my mouth, maybe to laugh the comment off, or otherwise hedge my bets against the humiliation and inevitable mocking laughter.
 Whatever it was I'd intended on saying evaporated away the instant he reached out and slowly slid his finger down the side of my face.
 The tiny part of me that was still screaming none of this could be real was pulled along by the rest of me.
 I completely abandoned myself to the sensations created by his touch.

Urban unemployment is around 8 per cent, but average industrial wages in the region fell by 17.5 per cent during the 1980s and the number of workers in the lower-wage informal sector doubled.
 Although population growth has slowed, a 72 per cent increase in labour participation rates for women is causing the work force to continue to expand rapidly.
 This region needs to double its employment growth rate to create 89 million new jobs during the 1990s in order to provide full employment opportunities for all its people.
 In sub-Saharan Africa, home to 20 of the 25 poorest nations in the world, urban unemployment afflicts some 14 million people, representing 15–20 per cent of the workforce, and is projected to more than double in the next ten years.
 Typically, youth comprise 65 to 75 per cent of the total unemployed.
 With the region’s population still growing at 3 per cent annually, these countries need to create 100 million new jobs in the coming decade just to maintain their present levels of unemployment.
 High population growth and a severe economic slowdown have generated high rates of unemployment in the Arab countries, estimated to exceed 25 per cent during the early 1990s, in spite of the very low labour participation rates among women in this region.
 In the aftermath of the Gulf crisis, labour-supplying countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, the Sudan and Syria have suffered the most.
 Returnees swelled Jordan’s population by 8.4 per cent and caused unemployment levels to rise above 20 per cent.
 Unemployment levels among Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank are among the highest in the world.

Intervention will also be necessary in the form of central planning and industrial policy, at least during the transition period.
 The radical restructuring of entire industries – defence, agriculture, aluminium, steel – is too complex and massive an undertaking to be made the responsibility of market forces and individual firms.
 7.Agriculture has to be given a special status: For reasons discussed in the previous chapter, the state has an especially important role in the regulation of agriculture.
 After the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, the rise of free market and free trade polemics generated considerable confusion regarding the necessity and legitimacy of state regulation and intervention in protecting and preserving agriculture, which is the beneficiary of innumerable subsidies and supports in virtually every industrialized nation.
 It is ironic that advice coming from overseas almost invariably recommended eliminating sup ports to this critical sector of the economy.
 In the midst of radical economic revolution, the economy, especially the agricultural economy, is in no position to adapt simultaneously to the dual stresses of internal reorganization and external competition.
 8.New institutions and systems are needed to create a market economy: The establishment of a free market system is retarded by the absence of many basic commercial institutions and systems.
 The market economy has given birth to a vast array of institutions by which, and through which, it operates – stock and commodity exchanges, systems for mass production, just-in-time inventory management, commercial insurance, franchises, mail order catalogues, courier services, feeder airlines, producers’ and consumers’ cooperatives, marketing boards, export pro motion agencies, leasing, venture capital and mutual funds, credit and collection agencies, commodity brokers, real estate agents, trade unions, industrial associations, industrial estates, exclusive export processing zones and countless others.
 Our knowledge of transitions will be complete and our capacity to abridge the time and costs of change will be full only when we have come to understand the role of these institutions and have found ways to develop them rapidly.
 The need for new institutions in Eastern Europe is apparent in all fields of commercial activity.

The transformation of social life in this century has drawn hundreds of millions of people away from a subsistence level existence in agriculture to urban areas and industrial employment.
 In the process it has brought about an unprecedented advancement in living standards around the world.
 But it has also engendered a way of life in which the livelihood of individuals is far more dependent than in the past on external conditions – the state of the national and global economy, trade policies, interest and exchange rates, levels of military spending and overall consumer demand.
 Modern society, even in the most liberal democracies, has become so structured that it leaves less and less freedom for truly independent individual initiative.
 Today, government intervenes in virtually every aspect of society’s economic existence, restricting the freedom of the individual to seek his or her own livelihood and determining the type and number of job opportunities available.
 Employment opportunities are directly linked to government tax policy concerning capital gains, depreciation, energy, wages and salaries, as well as by policies governing minimum wage laws, interest rates, budget deficits, imports and exports, environmental regulations and restrictions, defence spending, immigration, industrial development, investment, licensing of practitioners, zoning laws and countless other public policy issues.
 Without access to jobs, people lack the ability to ensure their own survival and support in modern society.
 As government has assured the right to education – indeed, compels it – it can and must also ensure the right of every person to gainful employment.
 Our very concept of the rights of the individual and the responsibilities of the society must undergo radical change.

 I couldn't blame him for being worried about how this was going to further strain already tense relations with Brandon's pack.

 “Half fairy, half elf.” He sat in a chair as he started to answer and I kept moving past the bench where I intended to land and crawled onto his lap, curling my feet up, knees to my chest.
 His voice seemed mesmerizing as he continued, “Her mother was a fairy from the West.
 Fiery one, her.” I wrapped my arms around my legs, holding my knees tight, and placed my chin there to rest my head.
 “Tell me more.” It was all I could do to pay attention to his words, but I was fascinated by their sound.
 “Her father was a dark elf.
 When her mother died during childbirth, he left her here in the village.
 I suppose it was for the best, really, since she can’t fly.
 The fairies would have tormented her.
 She’s still a bit of an outcast though.” He was still talking as I struggled to catch up in my head.

The secretary smoothed her blouse down over an ample stomach and smiled at me.
 I told myself I was just imagining that the smile never reached her eyes.
 She seemed to know who I was, and after identifying herself as Mrs. Pendely, proceeded to quiz me about which classes I'd been in at my last school.
 She stumbled a bit when I told her I hadn't enrolled in classes before moving.
 I didn't offer any additional information, so she tried to defuse the awkwardness by asking about electives.
 I answered numbly, picking out classes nearly at random.
 I already knew a school this size wouldn't have anything truly interesting.
 I'd never been willing to dedicate the time required to learn a musical instrument.
 I've always been passable at drawing scenery, but anything more complicated than a stick figure gives me fits, so art was out too.

I swayed just a little.
 Today it didn't seem quite as bad, as long as I didn't think of her actual name.
 "Mom, I don't want to be late.
 Thanks a bunch for the cupcake.
 Can we wait to celebrate until after school?"
 Now it was her turn to look guilty and fidget just a little bit.
 "Actually, that's why I wanted to talk to you this morning.

 He'd saved our house, got Mom a job, and then given me the best birthday present I could've asked for.
 I felt my insides clench and knot, but this time it was happiness that brought tears to my eyes.
 My wavering vision was just up to making out the outline of Rachel's present where I'd left it on the table.
 Feeling incredibly ungrateful and thoughtless, I limped over to the table and tore open the delicate wrapping paper.
 It was a copy of the latest Les Misérables movie, complete with the score from the most recent Broadway production, and a signed picture of the entire cast.
 Mom still wasn't home by the time it got dark, but I went to bed truly happy for the first time in ages.
 Rachel was the best friend a girl could wish for, and Brandon had come through in spades.

All I know is that the only way to appease them is to offer sacrifices of flowers.

Harruq stared at the name on the scabbard, mesmerized by the beauty of the writing.

While there was little agreement on what steps were needed to reverse the arms race and provide a stable basis for world peace, a consensus was emerging that something must be done to address the urgent problems of hunger, famine and endemic poverty that continued to plague much of the developing world and constituted a gnawing source of instability that refused to be contained by national boundaries.
 The unconscionable loss of lives due to hunger in an age of plenty generated growing concern over the issues of food and famine.
 Starvation forced millions of people, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, to flee their homes in despair.
 It undermined social stability, fuelled violence and in some cases led to war between neighbours and fellow-countrymen.
 The effort to glean more food from desiccated earth further ravaged the environment and aggravated shortages.
 To this was added the galling sight of hunger amidst plenty, when adequate food production was not matched by sufficient job opportunities to provide incomes to all who needed to buy food because they could not grow their own.
 These concerns motivated and were symbolized by the institution of the World Food Prize in 1987.
 It was in this context that, on World Food Day in October 1988, a small group met in Washington DC and proposed the launching of a new initiative to utilize the growing consensus over food to press for more rapid and substantial progress on peace, disarmament and development.
 Without peace there could be no stable basis or fertile soil for development, without development there could be no lasting and assured peace.
 The inextricable linkage between war and famine, economic dislocation and unemployment, violence and social in stability, fleeing refugees and migrating populations, high military spending and growing indebtedness argued compellingly against any uni-dimensional approach to resolving the problems of peace and development.

As the electoral franchise is the basis for the legitimacy and operation of democracy, access to gainful employment constitutes the economic franchise that lends legitimacy and functionality to a market economy.
 The right to employment must be constitutionally guaranteed to enable all citizens to exercise their fundamental right to food and health security and a share in national well-being.
 ICPF’s view called into question the blind faith in the wisdom of the unregulated market that was prevalent during the heady days of radical free-market economic doctrine following the collapse of the Soviet system.
 Critics claimed that achievement of full employment was impractical and therefore guaranteeing it was impossible.
 In response, the Commission argued that the level of employment in any society is the direct result of a nation’s laws, policies and modes of implementing them, not the result of impersonal forces of nature beyond human control.
 Employment is a product of human decisions and can be controlled.
 As the world has made enormous progress in halting and reversing environmental degradation, it can also eradicate the spectre of unemployment.
 What is required is genuine commitment enshrined and enforced as national policy.
 The Commission called on the nations of the world to recognize this right and enforce this guarantee.
 It is most appropriate that a meeting of the Commission is taking place during November 2004 in India, where the Government of India has proclaimed their recognition of this right and their commitment to enforce it through an act of parliament.

Chapter 8: Boy Meets World I officially moved out of my parents’ home when I was 15 years old, 35 years ago.
 I didn’t have a driver’s license yet, but I had a learner’s permit.
 I had no car and I walked, bummed a ride or hitchhiked if I needed to get someplace like work or high school.
 It was not easy living on my own and finding roommates at such a young age, but I managed.
 After a short stint of crashing on couches or extra bedrooms of several friends, I rented a room at a house with some other kids near my age.
 I was still in high school and I wanted to graduate, but I also needed money to live on.
 Rent, food, utilities and various expenses were all new to me.
 The father of my girlfriend Lori was an executive of a supermarket chain, and he made some calls and got me an interview.
 The manager explained to me that he would love to hire me but he had a hiring freeze on everyone but minorities.
 I had no idea what this meant so I asked, and he explained to me all the types of minorities that he could hire, including, American Indian.

Nations accord special status to their agricultural sector for several reasons.
 Continuous supplies of food are absolutely essential to the welfare of the population.
 Food prices are extremely sensitive to changes in the supply of foodstuffs.
 Even a small increase or decrease in supply can lead to a very wide fluctuation in prices.
 A bumper harvest can depress prices to the point of bankrupting large numbers of farmers.
 A poor harvest can send food prices soaring beyond the purchasing power of large numbers of people.
 Buffer stocks, subsidies and incentives are used to protect agriculture from sharp price fluctuations.
 Al though the principles of free trade argue that countries should produce only those items in which they possess a competitive advantage and procure the rest from overseas, few nations are willing to entrust their food supply entirely or even substantially to foreign parties.
 For decades Japan maintained trade barriers to keep the price of rice at more than six times the international level in order to protect and preserve domestic rice producers; the US government exports subsidized wheat; and the European Community sells subsidized milk powder and butter internationally at prices up to one-third below the domestic level.
 The debate over the legitimate role of government in protection of the agricultural economy is partially a question of timing.

He flipped onto his stomach, closing his eyes in anticipation.
 Ahhh.
 Those soft, slender hands imitated what she'd felt him do to her, rubbing and caressing.
 He only wished he could get her to do his chest as well so that he could gaze up at her as she ran her hands over him.
 Marie liked touching him.
 He was big and muscular, and she'd thought that just looking at him without his shirt was a great pleasure.
 But that was before she'd gotten to run her hands over him.

One second Brandon was a human, the next he was a huge monstrosity, a thing that normally dwelt in the bottom, most primitive parts of the mind, venturing out only to star prominently in nightmares.
 The rush of power beat back at our entire pack.
 If it'd been a physical wind it would've knocked me over.
 Intangible or not, it still staggered me and only my grip on Jasmin and Dom kept me from dropping to my knees.
 Alec stood motionless for a pair of seconds, and then seemed to explode and melt back into himself.
 I blinked, and his human body had been replaced with the hybrid form that'd saved my life once before.
 Only this time he wasn't fighting wolves, he was fighting another hybrid, and Brandon towered over him.
 There was another ripple of movement on the other side of the light.
 Jasmin and Dom both pulled away from me, joining the other three, facing outward in preparation for the inevitable attack.

Tears streamed silently as I drifted, the ache in my chest only dulled by exhaustion.
 I felt weak when I woke, but I was silent about the pain as we continued the journey.

 Rick opened her hotel room door for her and gave her the key.
 "I'm not going to have them wake us up.

 "OK."  She smiled up at him dreamily.

But I would be lying if I claimed to feel all that about God.
 My problem invites the question: how can I adore God when I don’t quite know what to make of him?
 I hear and read that he’s a person, and a spirit, who resides everywhere, outside and in us.
 I understand that if my imagination is too small to fathom God as a whole, which of course it is, I can grasp who God is by observing the qualities, nature, and actions of Christ.
 But though I have read, listened, prayed, and pondered about Jesus for dozens of years, in all honesty, given my definition, I can't claim to adore him either.
 Maybe if he were a woman, I could at least come closer to adoration, as I find women easier to adore.
 Not just for the pretty faces or figures, but for their gentler natures.
 Aside from my father and son, I can’t think of a man I have adored except Eric Curtis.
 Love?
 The heart of the Shema, Deuteronomy 6:5, commands Israel to: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.” Jesus agrees, in Matthew 22: "’Teacher,’ a disciple asks,  ‘which is the greatest commandment in the Law?’ Jesus replies: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.

I was a criminal.
 I silently wished Steed was here to build me a shelter so I could crawl in and hide until morning.
 I wasn’t about to try to build one on my own and risk embarrassing myself in front of Chevelle.
 A gust of wind pushed the flames beneath the spit, causing them to writhe and jump.
 They formed shapes that pulled at my memories.
 I tried to follow them, but couldn’t seem to get my thoughts to cooperate.
 I could remember my dreams, the wind and fire surrounding my mother.
 But the memories that came back when I woke from those vivid nightmares were dull.
 The harder I clutched at them, the more they drew away.
 When recognition dawned, I leapt from the rock, cursing Chevelle.

It was coming, this revolution of meaning, this concentration on the word.
 And, all along, behind it like a dark river, ran the beat, the melody, a sort of communication device that was both insidious and right out there in the open.

 “Yeah?” “They crashed.” My heart stopped and I gave up breathing.

The real constraint on job creation in the industrial nations is not the price of labour, but the need for increased capital investment, partly to counter the effects of reduced military spending and the drastic fall in output and demand in Eastern Europe.
 Increasing public investment to stimulate employment is constrained by widespread concern about rising levels of public debt.
 Recent reports state that the gross debt of OECD countries has risen from 35 per cent of GDP in 1970 to 70 per cent in 1993.
 But this figure is of questionable significance.
 The gross debt includes the debt held by government departments and public agencies as well as by private institutions and individuals.
 When the government-held portion is deducted, the actual net debt of these countries is approximately half the gross debt, which means the net interest burden for servicing the debt is also only half.
 Furthermore, it is not clear that a comparison of debt to GDP is a very meaningful index.
 Debt is a cumulative measure of stock, while GDP is an annual measure of flow.
 When the total debt of OECD countries is compared to the total capital stock of these countries, the debt is equal to a relatively modest 15 per cent of the current capital stock of these nations.
 In contrast to the recommendations made by the OECD, the Delors Plan for stimulating employment in Western Europe, which was recently rejected by member countries of the European Community, called for a large increase in public investment in expensive communication and transportation infra structure projects as a means of creating more jobs in the near term and increasing the competitive ness of European economies by improving their infra structure.

 of the increase in public investment was that it should stimulate the economy,92m with0m capital already heavily invested in opening new92m markets0m and stimulating competition. And this has not been limited only92m to0m deeply wealthy countries. But financing of public spaces92m labeled0m92m 0m"civil" has also been criticised by ethnic groups, including unqualified ethnic

The Immortalist was trying to become Celestial not a member of the Infernal realms.
 It was a very stringent rule that everyone knew not to break, not that any of the guards was going to mention it to the Guild.
 “Who are you?” asked the man that Rodregas had tagged as ‘the leader.’ “I am not sure who I am,” Rodregas responded.
 “And I think I will keep any answers that I figure out to myself for now.” “You are not Gerald though are you?” asked the AElf maiden.
 “Not to ask a dumb question,” Rodregas asked in a curious tone “but who is Gerald?”  Silence followed his query but finally he got an answer.
 “He is the man that you appear to be, whose body you now… have,” responded the maiden.
 “And what are you five named?” Rodregas asked.
 There was a pause at his question.
 He knew this was an important moment because once people say who they are they are much less likely to do violence.
 Rodregas did not understand the reason, but he knew that to be true.

So once you're done, I get to ask you any question?
 No restrictions?
 That was nearly a deal breaker, I could see it by the way his initial smile at my 'rolled eyes' faded away into his more characteristic seriousness.
 He contemplated his response for a good fifteen seconds, which was probably something like two hours in shape shifter time, before finally touching his pen to the paper again and then passing my notebook back.
 It's a deal.
 When I finish up with my questions, you can ask whatever you want.
 Of course if your question is something that's going to get you into trouble, I reserve the right to pack you onto a plane and send you off to safety once I'm done answering.

 Everything was just too unreal.
 I couldn't believe it was all happening, so I chose to ignore the implications of what he was saying.
 Boys like him didn't go for girls like me.

If society decides that useful jobs must be created, then they will be created.
 Full employment can be achieved by any country that has the will and determination to achieve it.
 This does not mean that every country can accomplish the goal immediately.
 Nor does it mean that governments should try to spend their way out of unemployment by creating artificial jobs for all who seek them.
 But the high current costs of the unemployed certainly suggest that there are more constructive ways to spend available resources to solve the problem.
 Instead, a commitment to self-employment should lead the government to reexamine and where necessary alter the nature of its priorities and policies and the structure of its economic system in order to make achievement of this goal possible.
 The magnitude of the task and the prescription may vary, but the goal and determination can be shared by all.
 Employment Strategies for the Industrial Nations
 In the industrial countries, the phenomena of jobless growth coupled with persistently high rates of youth unemployment and of chronic unemployment among the poorer sections will not be eradicated by even the most optimistic rates of economic expansion or mere incremental adjustments within the context of present attitudes and policies.

Brandon was sickly and skinny.
 My wife lay with him for hours rubbing his back and keeping fluids in him.
 He went from cold to hot and back again.
 In a couple of weeks he was looking much healthier and we sent him out into the world again.
 Turns out, just because I did drugs and knew people who were addicted to drugs I was still not qualified to understand how to break someone from craving the drugs that satisfy their addiction.
 Brandon seemed better and we thought we had helped him simply because we incarcerated him at home away from his peers until he had the drugs out of his system.
 In our mind, he was cured.
 Unfortunately, the problem had not been solved so easily.
 Like any good movie, this solution came too easily and too early in the drama.

He circled around and checked on the man.
 Rodregas could not tell if the man was alive or dead so he dismounted and took off the man’s helm.
 The man was covered in sweat and was surprisingly old.

 A few young squires ran out and helped to drag the man to get medical care.
 Rodregas’ next opponent followed in like manner, though he got up and gave Rodregas a second round.
 Rodregas circled around to Doi’van who held his spare shields and the provided lances.

It would not be surprising if a patrol of the Immortal Guard would be on the road.
 The road was the main route from the port city of Chrisana Stone to the Menagerie of Sky, Earth and Water; the slave city run by the Immortalist Taiga.
 Most likely what Imeralda sensed was simply a trade caravan running a regular route from Chrisana Stone to any of several of the Eastern Realms cities.
 If it was a light scouting patrol of just two or three guards that was coming; it would be the best case scenario for them to take on some Immortalist Guards and gain better weapons, armor and horses.
 Of course, if it was a slave caravan then they would simply sit and watch, as it would be suicide to do anything against a full patrol.
 Rodregas heard a rustle in the brush and glanced over to make sure it was just a squirrel or the like.
 He started to jump up as a humanoid shape appeared out of the trees, until he saw that it was just Imeralda.
 She seemed to be paying less attention now to stealth as she was to speed.
 From Imeralda’s expression Rodregas knew it was something more dangerous than a trade caravan coming down the road.
 Imeralda squatted down next to them and whispered, “A slave caravan is coming; it’s small but they have a score of guards.

It was a kind of bear that Rodregas had not heard of in the mortal world, even larger than ‘his’ lion.
 The bear actually had a thick tail and its teeth seemed far larger than any bear he had heard of.
 Doi’van stood there looking up at the great beast for a long moment.
 Then he cocked his head; his nose went up as if he smelled something.
 He stepped around the great bear and headed toward the back wall.
 The score of statues, while separated, were clustered in the middle of the great room.
 The four walls of the room seemed to be set back with the ceiling gently coming down in the form of great arches.
 In one of the great arches was the door they had entered.
 The stone around the door was the gray of the local granite.

Flying overhead, Dieredon watched the beginning of the battle with a sickness in his stomach.
 The man in black had come.

 “Fly back to the others, Sonowin, we will battle this day.” The horse snorted, making Dieredon laugh.
 “No, I am sure you won’t be hurt.” Sonowin banked, giving the elf one last view of the battle before soaring east to where the rest of the Quellan elves waited atop their magnificent pegasi.
 His horse neighed a quick question, one Dieredon wished he could laugh at.
 “Everyone can be killed,” he said, tying his hair behind his head.
 “And no, I have no plans of breaking my ribs again.”
 The horse made an interesting little noise, one Dieredon had long ago learned was laughter.

I felt every step, holding tight as the horse’s hooves slipped and jumped.
 The haze thickened, keeping the view both ahead and behind close.
 It gathered in my hair, leaving it a matted mess with the single braid—Ruby’s handiwork—dripping condensation over the shoulder of my cloak.
 I decided to practice as we rode, closing my eyes to sink partially into my horse, still alert to my own self and the outside world.
 It was there, leading my horse and seeing through his eyes, that the pain struck.
 It came on instantaneously, hitting me like a blade, cutting, shearing.
 It was accompanied by sharpness of sound as well.
 My ears were in excruciating pain.
 The horse dropped, his head smacked to the ground and I watched through his eyes as he hit.
 The animal’s senses stilled, not panicked as my own.

I watched for hours before I was sure, too stunned to believe it possible.
 I had heard stories, the fairies were always puffing dust about it, but I’d never believed it.
 Was I really watching humans?
 I was pulled from reading, confused.
 Humans weren’t real.
 What kind of book was this?
 She had mentioned fairies’ stories.
 I wondered if this was fiction, a fairy ruse, given to Chevelle by Ruby.
 Or maybe the dust was still playing havoc on me.
 I glanced over my shoulder at Ruby where she watched anxiously out the front window.

He searched through the captain’s pair of trunks and found some clothes that fit him, though tightly.
 The captain had been a big man but not as large as Rodregas now was.
 Still the soft linen shirt of light brown, which he knew had been loose on the captain, was much more comfortable than the wizard robe he had been wearing.
 Unfortunately none of the pants would fit.
 Poir, though a large man, had skinny legs.
 Rodregas felt ridiculous wearing only a linen shirt and his coin purses as he stepped to the armory door.
 The door was built of massive slabs of iron oak.
 Rodregas reached up and pulled the emergency key from the crack at the right of the door.
 Due to his status as a senior sergeant, he knew where the key was kept.
 Once the door was open, he stepped inside.

“Last night at the arena party you agreed to ask Van’dret where Oreintvenir is,” She replied in a clear clipped voice.
 “Actually,” Van’dret responded, “I think I said that my visit to his solar would be a perfect opportunity to ask him if he knew the location of our missing Grand Master.” “So why did you not take advantage of the opportunity?
 If anyone knows where Oreintvenir is; it is Taiga” “My lovely Gracella, you are an Immortalist of impressive power and intellect.
 But we are Immortalist, time is on our side and Grand Master Oreintvenir has been gone for less than a year.
 It is not unusual for one of his power to be gone for such a length of time.
 He could be anywhere on this world or beyond it.
 There is no need to be in such a... rush to ask questions.” “Van’dret doesn’t play your word games with me, you know, and I know that this is not a normal disappearance.
 Not with one of the great cosmic alignments coming in such a short time.
 Neither of us would be surprised if Taiga had killed him and taken his place.
 But, then he would simply have called a concave and be elected Guild Master if that was the case.” “You’re not suggesting that Taiga is involved in some foul play against the Grand Master are you?” asked Van’dret his tone equally outraged and surprised.

He weighed over 200 pounds and he could do some damage any way he beat us.
 The primary goal when getting beaten by a person nearly twice one’s size is to limit injuries and not escalate the violence because there is no winning.
 I had seen this tactic with my grandfather and my uncle, and my brother and I were now in a similar situation.
 When someone saw the marks or bruises on our bodies we lied so we didn’t get a repeat performance.
 Gym teachers or other kids during showers after PE class asked the most questions.
 We just blamed it on each other as a fight between brothers.
 We just learned to live with it and survive.
 We became quite the fighters at school and other kids learned not to screw with us or we would beat them down.
 It was just something one gets good at when one is in constant training.

She used the awkwardness to gain further separation between them.
 Her hands ached from the force of every block and parry.
 Her breath was fast and shallow.
 Her hair, which she had failed to tie up before the fight, hung in wild strands before her face.
 She was beautiful, but Harruq did not see it.
 To Harruq, she was the young girl cradling her sister.
 Aurelia thrust her right hand forward, her fingers spread wide and stiff.
 Words of power poured from her lips, and without hesitation the forest obeyed.

I'd read stories where people claimed to have felt someone's gaze trying to bore a hole in their back, but this was the first time I'd ever experienced it for myself.
 I hadn't even believed it was possible, but the pins and needles I'd felt starting the second she'd looked up hadn't disappeared until I put a brick wall between us.
 Biology would've been unpleasant even without everything else that was going on.
 The air conditioning was out to part of the building, and Mrs. Sorenson's classroom was one of the ones that apparently were going to go without until they got the regulator or switcher, or whatever it was, fixed.
 I bowed out of our little competition even earlier than usual.
 I probably should have stayed in the game longer, should have kept answering questions until she came up with a real stumper, but I wasn't in the mood.
 Once I was safely free to let my mind wander, I couldn't think of anything other than the look on Jasmin's face.
 Even the steadily rising temperatures achieved by packing more than thirty bodies into a tiny classroom with only one door wasn't sufficient to really distract me.
 I was going to suffer once again for having stumbled into somewhere I didn't want to be.
 By the time I made it into English and sat down next to Britney, my heart felt like it was going to seize up.

If you were assassins, you would strike without chatter.
 You are nothing but pretenders.”
 Harruq clanged his swords together, showering the ground with sparks.
 His armor shimmered as his anger grew.
 “Pretenders with wonderful toys,” the elf continued, eyeing Harruq’s blades.
 “Toys I will take from your dead bodies.”
 He leapt down the stairs in a single bound.
 His feet hardly touched before he was vaulting over a red silk couch to land before the fireplace.
 He drew an ornate sword that hung over the fireplace, letting the scabbard fall to the floor.
 The blade gleamed in the firelight, impossibly sharp and deadly.

It was still early and he begged me to let him sleep a little longer, saying he hadn’t slept well.
 I insisted, and told him he could lie back down after the test.
 Since I knew he had a device called a Wizinator that is sold at smoke shops to look like you are pissing—it has a bag filled with either synthetic urine or someone else’s—I made him show me he was really pissing.
 After he complied, he crawled back into bed.
 Positive for Oxy.
 Top of the scale positive.
 I looked over at Brandon to see him peering at me from the bed, knowing that drug tests don’t lie but drug addicts do.
 I screamed at him to pack his shit and get the fuck out.
 I had been left with only one option—to toss Brandon out on the street to hit bottom— because what I was doing wasn’t enough.
 Or maybe what I was doing was too much?

She claimed that she could keep going, but she fell asleep on the way home.
 They were too tired to do anything but watch TV that evening.
 They went to bed early, but still, she didn't wake up until almost 9:00 the next morning.
 There was no use walking in the garden this morning, she decided with a yawn.
 She listened carefully but didn't hear Rick's shower or any noise in the kitchen.
 It was past his usual breakfast time, so he'd be starved when he got up.
 She could have breakfast ready for him, maybe even serve it to him in bed.
 Jumping up, she pulled on a pair of shorts and a t-shirt and ran downstairs.
 She didn't know how to make very much, but she could scramble some eggs, prepare bacon in the microwave, and make some toast.
 It didn't even take very long.

He looked over to the short swords laying on one of the tables and picked two of them up; they felt a little weird.
 The swords were too light and the balance seemed off as he took a few practice strokes.
 There was a large two-handed great sword, a weapon that was difficult to handle if you were not very strong, and its sheath matched the armor he now wore.
 Rodregas picked it up and took a few swings and found that it was not as clumsy as he thought it would be.
 It was of average make, and he did not like such large swords.
 The weight provided a lot of momentum and power for a strike, but if you missed it was hard to recover and very easy to leave yourself wide open for a counter strike from your opponent.
 It looked like the guards had gone to celebrate “his” birthday by taking most of the better armor and weapons with them.
 Rodregas grabbed a shield as well, and a barrel of the best looking arrows and carried them to the front entrance.
 There was probably money in the purser’s office, but he knew that the door, as well as the room was rigged with poison needles and other traps, both mundane and magical.
 Rodregas had the impression that Ravenhurr had spent most of his wealth of late on the Dire Cats.

"Alec, was the letter from Donovan?"
 I had to repeat the question again before he shook himself and nodded.
 "I've been running letters back and forth between the two of them since I was ten.
 I don't come out here very much, but I make the trip as often as it's safe to do so.
 They both live for those letters."
 We walked in silence for several more seconds before I got the nerve up to verify my interpretation of what I'd just seen.
 "She was just looking inside you to see if you've developed a power yet, wasn't she?"
 Alec helped me over an especially daunting rock and then nodded.
 "And nothing has changed.

After awhile he started to take the presence of the Dire Cats for granted and stopped worrying about the danger.
 Several weeks later, came the first night where neither the cats nor Doi’van were in the room.
 Doi’van was out messing with the well, Imeralda was reading one of the magic Grimoires by the fireplace.
 Rodregas was supposed to be reading as well, but had lost his focus on the complex diagram and was just looking at Imeralda.
 She was so beautiful, slim yet curvy.
 Some of those curves were smooth muscle and some were pure female.
 She seemed to have brought together two of the most attractive parts of the AElves and the Nymphs: the slim athletic body of the AElf with the full curves of a Nymph.
 Her skin had a smooth, light golden brown color that often shined with sweat during their practices and looked so soft that it was hard not to reach out and touch it.
 “Did you need something?” asked Imeralda.
 Rodregas had not realized that she had noticed him watching her.

 It obviously hadn't crossed Mom's mind that they might decide to go with someone else.
 Waffling over whether or not to take the job was one thing when she was sure she'd have it in the end.
 It was entirely different when it might cost her the biggest break she'd ever had.
 She nodded jerkily as she stepped out of the room, already dialing.

No answer.
 “Aurelia!

 Only the calm, scattered sounds of the forest returned his call.
 “Damn elf,” Harruq grumbled, crossing his arms and looking all about.
 “She’s probably not here.
 He just sent me out here to look stupid yelling at trees.”
 “And what elf would that be?” asked a familiar voice from behind.
 Harruq whirled, his heart jumping as Aurelia stepped out from behind a tree.

After I grew to manhood, I decided my true place was among one of the other clans, one that follows the lordship of the Hellborn.” He spoke this very slowly each deep rumble of his tone dragged out.
 “I was wrong though, and quickly realized that those who follow the Lords of the Infernal Realms were even a worse fit for me than at home, though they did see me as royal blood and not tainted.” Doi’van added, “I eventually decided to start somewhere new and took a ship across the inland sea.” Doi’van paused at this and shook his head, his hair flying wild, as he seemed to want to shake out a memory from his massive head before he continued.
 “I am afraid I did not ask enough questions.
 I just wanted to get a fresh start.
 I was in Guild Dealer Taigas’ Menagerie to be sold within a week of my arrival.” He finished, his smile fading at the memory.
 “When was that?” Rodregas asked.
 Doi’van looked at him for a second and said, “Two years ago.” “But that makes no sense,” Rodregas said, his voice angry though he did not know why.
 “The Guild is supposed to be trying to make their Immortalists members Celestial.
 Why would they hold you for two years?” Doi’van nodded but then shook his head.
 “Trust me, I would like to know that answer more then you.” Doi’van’s smile was now long gone and with a shrug of his huge misshaped shoulders, he changed the subject.

Just one, the half-orc noticed, but that would quickly change.
 “Perhaps you’ll have some use after all,” Qurrah said to the bones.
 He whispered words of magic as the elf took a few steps closer and notched an arrow.
 A purple fire surrounded the bones, pulled them into the air, and then hurled them in a giant wave.
 The elf released his own arrow, but Qurrah was faster.
 He dove to the side as the arrow clacked against the stone.
 The elf tried batting the bones away, but he was a fool, unaware of the strength guiding them.
 They shattered his bow, crashed into his slender form, and tore flesh and armor.
 “Kill him,” Qurrah said to the bones.
 They swirled in the air above the elf like a tornado, and all at once they plunged downward, deep into his flesh.

We become drunkards or fornicators, selfish, consumed with pride and prejudice and intolerance.
 But the sinful heart can’t find happiness.
 And God, he assured us, wants his creatures to get happy, which is why Christ said we must be born again, so he could give us new moral natures, new affections, new objectives, and new directions.
 What planted the hook in me was: according to Billy Graham, when you make your decision for Christ, you do it for the sake of the nation and the world.
 Without God, any nation will perish.
 And a nation is only as strong as its people.
 A better world requires better nations of better people.
 Christ can make us into those people.
 Billy Graham had injected some hope into at least one heart often shamed by its selfish and ornery ways.

 She couldn't make up her mind between chocolate-covered cherry and chocolate almond, so he asked for a sample of each.

 Rachel's face went from a mobile, beautiful thing to a near-perfect mask.
 Even in my befuddled state it was obvious she was lying.

 True or not, that rumor is the most romantic thing anyone here has ever heard.

 The haze was starting to evaporate from my thoughts, the story still didn't make sense, but Rachel's explanation did.

I started to feel like that, that I was a chimp, a dancing fool.
 This was like before The Moratorium, right?
 Before we really all felt the power.
 The War was just this endless one-note playing over and over and driving us insane—me insane, sorry, driving me insane.
 And, like, I know that a song is just a song—yet, I have to believe there is something there, an element, a catalytically charged element.
 I didn’t want religion—who listens to priests, clergymen, even those who take to the streets?
 Ali has more power.
 Ali reaches more people.
 But a song, you know, a good song, well, it does tunnel deep into the consciousness.
 Did I think I could do anything with the right words, well-placed, well-played?

As he did, a thought hit him.
 His eyes went back and forth from his own name and Qurrah’s.
 “You spelled my name wrong,” Harruq said.
 “What?
 How?”
 The half-orc reached over, erased the k in his name and drew a clumsy, capitalized Q at the end.
 He leaned back and smiled.
 The name in the dirt now read ‘HarruQ’.
 “Why did you change it?” she asked.
 “It’s a rather odd spelling.”

His word choice didn't inspire an overabundance of confidence, but I could hardly turn and run away after begging to be allowed to come watch.
 The path seemed to shrink as we were walking, and almost too quickly sand replaced the crunch of gravel under our feet.
 I recognized Alec's humanoid form from before, a massive, black, heavily furred tower of muscle, claws and fangs.
 I might have pulled back at his approach, but the eyes, even with their vertical pupils were still undeniably his.
 A paler, more icy blue than I was used to, but it was still him looking out at me from the other side.
 Everyone else was harder to pick out, but I gave it my best shot.
 Isaac was probably the bluish-black hybrid who was nearly as big as Alec.
 His utter stillness in comparison to the constant motion of the rest of the pack was too much like his normal self-mastery for it to be anyone else.
 The other hybrid, the gray one with his teeth showing and just the barest hint of a growl had to be James.

The next phase brought the discovery of tools and instruments that made the material resources far more productive and valuable than before.
 Gradually, society discovered rudimentary organizational resources – the capacity to organize productive activities in a more effective manner.
 The organization of farming utilized the tree to make a plough with which to cultivate repeatedly the same land, giving birth to sedentary societies.
 The organization of crafts, commerce, armies, governments – constructed from a fabric of customs, rules, systems and laws – each made use of the material resources for greater productivity, power and achievement.
 At each stage of this evolution, society discovered the power of knowledge to increase further the productivity of the material, technological and organizational resources at its disposal.
 A knowledge of weather patterns boosted productivity in agriculture.
 A knowledge of astronomy enabled sea-worthy vessels to travel across the oceans to distant lands.
 This led to the invention of systematic education as a method to pass on acquired knowledge and skills to the next generation and thereby continuously increase them.
 The Ultimate Resource
 These rich and varied discoveries came as the result of a careful observation and analysis of the external world around us, an infinite exploration and experimentation with things, an endless trial and error blending of minerals and plants to forge metals and produce medicines.

I knew if she sprang at me, I was going to get really hurt.
 When Brandon's hand appeared on Cassie's shoulder to restrain her, I thought for a second my knees would buckle.
 A few seconds later, it was as if nothing had ever happened.
 The ring of spectators dissolved as kids quickly returned to their tables.
 Brandon and his friends left through one set of cafeteria doors, while Alec and his friends departed through the other.
 Britney looked like she was trying to decide whether to be mad or impressed, but I felt too sick to stick around and try to nudge her in either direction.
 I mumbled something I hoped sounded intelligible and headed towards the bathroom.
 I passed Mr. Simms and another teacher on my way out, but apparently I looked as awful as I felt.
 They just shot me stern looks rather than stopping me to ask what had happened.

 Mike was sitting behind the driver’s seat.
 While the cabbie waited for an opening into the boulevard traffic, Mike leaned up close and growled, “It’s a good thing you don’t plan to get us roughed up, or else I’d have to pinch your head off.” The cabby muttered something in Spanish and made a face that seemed to say, “Go ahead, what do I care?” At an historic saloon called The Long Bar, Eric told me about all three prostitutes he’d talked to, where they came from, how large their families were, and he remembered most of their entire formal names.
 He spoke as if they had met at a box social.
 And he kept asking, “What can we do?” As if our mission was to fix all the world’s broken people.
 Eric was the fastest middle-distance runner in our school.
 Baseball was my best game.
 But Eric and I had alienated some coaches.

 There was no more talking, each had plenty of their own thoughts to mull over.
 Rodregas was feeling pretty good at the moment, dangerously positive.
 He had learned long ago that the better you felt, the harder came the emotional fall.
 He knew this was all too good to last, but knowing that it would not last also made it more important that he enjoy the moment.
 Rodregas was free.
 He was being hunted; but hunted because he had finally dealt out justice.
 He had killed two monsters, two who wore faces not their own, and who he could feel no remorse for killing.
 Rodregas had finally escaped to his quiet place in the mountains to rest and, best of all, with two companions who seemed to be good people.

I opened my eyes to find I was sitting on the ground next to my sleeping body.
 I saw Emily sitting there, saying nothing for once.
 Something fell off my back and I picked it up.
 It was a wooden bow, and when I reached behind my back I felt a quiver full of feathered arrows strapped there.
 I ran a finger over the smooth, dark wood and turned to see Seth crashing out of the woods.
 I smirked at him and pointed at his head.
 “You have dark blue hair.” I giggled, not knowing why I was giggling after what had just happened to us a few minutes ago.
 He frowned and pulled a piece or two out of his head.
 His eyes widened, and I laughed at the shock on his face.

She was still whispering, but the words sheared through the darkness, arresting my fall.
 I didn't want him here, didn't want to give him another reason to despise me.
 What if Jasmin came with him?
 The thought of lying helpless with her in the same room sent shivers of cold sliding down me.
 I couldn't see, so I reached out, blindly trying to find the phone before Rachel could dial Alec.
 My questing hand finally found the tiny, hard-plastic package, and I grabbed on with all of my fading strength.
 The darkness was still beckoning, but alternating images of Jasmin and Alec flashed before my eyes.
 I was so confused that I couldn't make sense of the flood of emotions that accompanied the pictures, other than the fact that terror came to the forefront as they sped up.
 Faster and faster the two figures changed places, and then they disappeared.

In the modern era, society has become the principle target and victim of war.
 With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, technology and economic activity in support of fighting forces became an increasingly significant factor.
 As a result, more and more effort was directed at eliminating or crippling the enemy’s economic and industrial capacity and the ‘national will’ to wage war.
 Targeting of civilian populations became increasingly common.
 In the two world wars in this century, opposing sides waged all-out war against the military, political, economic and social resources and capacities of the enemy society.
 The strategic bombings of the Second World War, the fire-bombing of Tokyo, and the nuclear devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki took this concept to the extreme.
 As a result, the ratio of military to civilian casualties in military conflicts changed dramatically.
 In the First World War, there were 20 military casualties for each civilian death.
 In the Second World War, the ratio was one to one.
 In the Korean War, civilian deaths out numbered military losses five to one.

 Some said Dylan was there, in disguise.
 It was Dylan who was later quoted widely as saying, “Buddy could have been bigger than me.
 He had Old Harry on his side.” With bigger success came more drugs, more women, more more.
 Death.
 The official ruling was death by asphyxiation, choking on his own vomitus.
 It began to seem coroners handed this out to rock stars by rote.
 Janis and Jimi set the standard; anything less would be unseemly, not up to snuff.
 Next to his naked body were the cliché syringe, bottle of Jack Daniels and a sheet of lyrics, a half-finished song to be called, apparently, “Wendy Ward Redux,” as if at the end he tried to return to past glories and died trying.

He was making music, Memphis music, as sacred a calling as one could imagine.
 Eventually, Buddy found his grounding, a group almost as flexuous and capable as Buddy, though few could approach Buddy’s genius for the ineffable, that secret other place he could go with his music.
 Black Lung was born in the mid-sixties in an abandoned gas station when a bass player named Crafty Connor was introduced to Buddy through the coagulant Sid Selvidge.
 Memphis music bred Memphis music, is how Sid describes it today.
 Crafty, who had a face like moits in wool, attended East High where he had picked up the bass guitar (and put down his flugel horn much to his parents’ disfavor) when he first heard Jack Bruce play.
 He wanted to be part of a power trio.
 He wanted to be part of the best power trio Memphis could build and he wanted to build it.
 He called Sid who said, “Well, you could do a lot worse than hooking up with this young guitar kraken, Buddy Gardner.”  Crafty called Buddy.
 Buddy called Skippy Quetzalcoatl, who had a drumming lineage like no one else’s.

All these years, I have believed that in some vaguely Christ-like way, Eric died as a sacrifice.
 I reasoned like this: From at least two months away, he saw a big change approaching.
 As it neared, he apprehended it ever more clearly.
 Two weeks or so he had spent gathering his treasures and giving them away.
 By two nights before the big day, he knew it would be something compared to which most crises meant nothing.
 Very likely, he believed it might be death.
 He told Kenny to leave Billy and me at home.
 In some way he wanted to spare us.
 I used to suppose he hadn't exactly known his motive, only felt that whatever was coming at him, we shouldn’t have to witness.
 The only sense I could make of it all was that something way beyond reason or observation took place in his heart, mind or spirit.

"You're right.

 The words were broken by gasping sobs, but they were understandable, if only just barely.

 Not after everything else he'd already done for me.
 Guilting him into helping me more just felt wrong.

Hour after hour passed in silent misery, until finally the rest of the kids wore themselves out and it quieted down enough for me to lapse into a fitful sleep.
 I was smack-dab in the middle of a dream about Rachel and Britney when everything changed.
 Ever so slowly, the normal dreamscape took on a sharp-edged glow, and then morphed into the breathtaking colors that'd wormed their way even deeper into my heart than I'd realized.
 I didn't recognize my surroundings, but they were different than any of the places I'd been before.
 The new scents whipping past me on the breeze were sign enough even if I hadn't been able to detect the subtle differences in the light emanating off of the foliage paving the trail I was walking along.
 For the length of the dream I lost myself in the wonder of experiencing the world in all of its amazing depth.
 Still, even the pure delight in my surroundings wasn't enough to mute the feeling something was missing.
 Chapter 19 It seemed like the old karmic scale was still going strong and trying very hard to make up for how great Les Misérables had been.

 Marie couldn't sleep that night.
 She was going to Hollywood!
 She wouldn't be able to see Mary Pickford or Douglas Fairbanks, but maybe she'd see some of her new favorites, like Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts.
 She managed to doze a little but was wide awake before dawn.
 Deciding to do an aerobics tape until it was light enough to walk in the garden, she put on her workout clothes and went downstairs.
 She didn't know how she was going to be able to wait two entire days.
 She was so excited that she felt like she could run all the way to Hollywood.

 His eyes widened and he looked down at the ground below, obviously trying to imagine what it had looked like.

The light brown curls that framed her pretty face bounced around playfully.

By the time I reached the door I was contemplating just finding a decent tree and spending the afternoon outside.
 The sight of a white envelope, barely visible against the off-white door, was enough to drive those thoughts out of my head.
 It had my name on the side that'd been facing the door.
 I pulled it down as I walked inside the house.
 Mom was gone, there wasn't any reason I couldn't read whatever was in the envelope in the living room, but I found myself quickly climbing up our creaky stairs and closing my bedroom door behind me.
 I tore the envelope open and pulled out a piece of heavy paper, almost like parchment.
 The writing was elegant, a kind of flowing script that was different from anything I'd ever seen, but which paled against the sheer artistry of the sigil positioned at the bottom of the note.
 Adriana, Your words of thanks were altogether unexpected, but decidedly appreciated.

 When it struck the wooden gate, it exploded.
 Wood shattered.
 Guards behind the gate howled as molten rock struck them, piercing through their shields and armor.

There were curving lines and symbols covering the skin.

 I gasped.
 I’d been around fire magic for as long as I could remember.
 It had never burnt me or any other elf as far as I knew; it would only burn what it was meant to burn.
 I glanced back down at the scroll, realizing the fire magic had been meant to burn.
 I should never have read the words aloud.
 I carefully picked it up and rolled it back in place, certain I would never read from it again.
 Binding the pouch as I had found it, I tucked it into the pack.
 When I checked my hands to decipher the lines, I realized I was seeing a map.

No wife, no children.” “You are expected to have a wife and child after just two decades of life?” He laughed for some reason I could not see.
 “Then you have no family of your own?” “I am not expected to pair for quite some time, if ever.
 And children?
 Ha!” He was visibly perplexed so I kept talking.
 “I have a family as well, though my mother died recently.” Sadness washed his features.
 “I’m sorry.
 Was it an imp?” “No.” I laughed at the strange idea.
 And for no apparent reason, I told him the truth.

He drew away slowly, feeling my shock, or seeing it in my eyes, and realizing his mistake.
 His expression fell, but he didn’t take his hands away.
 He swallowed hard, waiting for my confirmation.

 I couldn’t seem to reconcile the two lives.
 “I… I think I’m just Frey.” Chevelle’s hands slid to my shoulders, tension in his grip.

 Even my eyeballs ached.
 “Okay,” I said.

I knew I had serious problems, but I didn't think they were obvious to everyone that looked at me.
 English was next, and odds were it would be a nearly exact repeat of Biology, possibly minus the awkward introduction.
 The thin, distinguished looking teacher absently accepted my proffered form, starting a little when I didn't leave.
 "Right then, I suppose you need a signature?"
 The accent was so British I half-wanted to ask him how he ended up in Sanctuary.
 I nodded, scanning his desk while I waited.
 Whethers, Mr. Whethers.
 "Right then, I believe there is a vacancy next to Ms. Samuels in the back."
 People were still trickling into the room, so at least I was spared the full gantlet, but the few gazes I met were still unfriendly until I reached the last table.
 The skinny-ish blond girl already at the table smiled at me as I sat down.

"Scientists think that it would be possible to travel through time by going through these wormholes the author mentions, but it's all theory.

 Marie sighed.
 "This book isn't hard to follow, but I'm rather skeptical.
 The author says that thought is the way to travel through time.
 He says that if you concentrate hard enough on getting to the time you want to visit, you can do it."

 Could we do something else?
 Will you show me how to use the washing machine?"
 After they'd put in a load of clothes, they had some ice cream and then returned to the living room to read.
 Rick had gotten her the Dragonriders of Pern series, since those books were about a world that was new to all readers and had very few offensive elements.

"You just picked sides, and you picked the wrong one."
 Maybe I still wasn't recovered from my ordeal on Friday; I felt like I was missing something obvious.
 Britney apparently agreed, and she wasted no time in letting me know what it was.
 "There are two in-crowds here; Brandon's group, which consists of all of the athletes and cheerleaders, and Alec's group, which is about half the size, and outside of his immediate friends is made up of a few geeks and misfits.
 You were on the border of getting in with Brandon, but just threw all of that away to save Alec's little sister when he's too much of a coward to do it himself."
 I wanted to protest, to explain why everyone should be able to get along, or point out that despite Brandon's obvious appeal, it was his friend who was wrong, but Britney had already turned and stalked off.
 I probably would've spent the next few minutes refining my arguments for the next time we talked, but the last thing Britney had said finally sank in.
 His sister.
 Rachel was Alec's sister, and he hadn't made a move to save her.
 He hadn't even been willing to let his friends step in and stop the fight.

I have been too busy working on my studies.” Korin now looked at him with a surprised expression and an eyebrow slightly raised.
 Rodregas wondered if he had said something wrong.
 While he had seen the two interact for some years, he really did not know what was appropriate for him to say in such a circumstance.
 Rodregas knew that he did not have the skills for pretending he was a powerful Immortalist sorcerer, so he said, “How many people have you killed during the past year Korin?
 And how many others have you raped or tortured?” he asked, trying to keep a calm voice.
 Now Korin looked very surprised and he started looking around.
 Rodregas saw that Korin noticed the study door, though he was working hard to not show it.
 “How many?” Rodregas repeated his question.
 “I am not sure,” Korin said.
 “For us to truly become divine we must of course develop our skills.” As Korin answered the question he took a step back.

Chapter 8
 I stood, frozen in fear at the sight of the dragon.
 It stalked towards me.
 The piercing green eyes bore into mine and I was more scared than I had ever been in all 15 years of my life.
 “Jazell move!” Seth yelled and pushed me behind him so hard, I almost fell over.
 I caught myself and pulled out my bow, notching an arrow.
 We all tensed, prepared for a fight.
 All of a sudden, Emily walked towards the dragon.
 Seth yelled at her to get back but she ignored him.
 She stood right in front of its head and opened her mouth, bizarre sounds started coming out.

 “Maybe you should sit down,” he warned.
 That sounded like a good idea.
 “Half-breed?” I asked, unable to form full sentences.
 “Half fairy, half elf.” He sat in a chair as he started to answer and I kept moving past the bench where I intended to land and crawled onto his lap, curling my feet up, knees to my chest.
 His voice seemed mesmerizing as he continued, “Her mother was a fairy from the West.
 Fiery one, her.” I wrapped my arms around my legs, holding my knees tight, and placed my chin there to rest my head.

He couldn’t stand to see her so unhappy, but he didn’t want her to leave.
 He loved her.
 He headed upstairs to make sure she’d found all the books and articles.
 She was coming out of the office with a load of them.
 “I’m going to look at them in my room,” she told him.
 “You can use the office.
 I don’t care.” “No—my room is fine.” The light reflected off her diamond as she turned away from him.
 Rick’s stomach clenched.

Even within developing countries, surging demand for education, health care, tourism, communication, financial and retail services has opened up opportunities that were available to the developed countries only at a much later stage in their development.
 Outsourcing: During the last decade enormous attention has been focused on the lucrative employment potentials generated by Information and Communication Technology (ICT), particularly the high paid jobs in computer software and hardware and the less technical jobs in business process outsourcing.
 Countries such as India have shown that they can leapfrog into the technological vanguard by developing qualified human resources to meet the ever-expanding shortage in these sectors.
 Information Technology and IT-enabled services stand out as the most important new fields of employment to emerge since the popularization of the automobile.
 While the Commission’s report anticipated the importance of the information superhighway even before the World Wide Web radically transformed global communications, information exchange and commerce, ICPF did not foresee the dramatic impact that the Internet would have on the future export of service jobs to developing countries.
 The West has been exporting manufacturing jobs in large numbers for half a century, fuelling the growth of Japan, the East Asia tigers, and more recently China; but until the emergence of the information superhighway, the scope for export of service jobs was limited.
 Technological development has changed that.
 As a result, business process outsourcing has become one of the fastest growing sectors of the world economy.
 As growth of the labour force slows in high-income countries, there will be increasing pressure for export of service jobs.
 Public concern in the West over the rapid growth of outsourcing is fuelled by the common misconception that employment is a zero sum game.

While there92m are0m many opportunities to work in the private sector right now, it is difficult to92m make0m an accurate assessment of what opportunities exist because job outsourcing in any given quarter of92m income0m, especially within any92m given0m country,

I could probably deal with not having a boyfriend, even assuming that was what we were right now.
 Going half a year without anyone to talk to because my mom was wrapped up with her art and everyone else in the town thought I was stuck-up would be more than I could take.
 The thought was enough to leave me speechless for the entire drive home.
 Brandon seemed content to leave me alone with my thoughts as he sped around the various turns at speeds that normally would've made me protest.
 As I went to leave the car, he grabbed me by my back pocket, which nearly made me shriek in surprise.
 "Hey, you know what you need to put all this in perspective?"
 "No, but then I think it's more than just a matter of my perspective being off."
 My fear of alienating him had almost vanished in the rush of indignation over how he'd grabbed me.

On the holidays I sent my boys out to give freshly baked cookies to the people who collected our garbage.
 I taught the boys how to care for our yard, mowing and edging, and they had household responsibilities and chores (and I never sprayed them with a hose nozzle, at least not to compel yard work).
 I believed they needed to learn good strong work ethics.
 But I never once hit them, and I never abused them, as I had learned “what not to do” as a father.
 I did everything I could think of to give them the best chance to succeed in life.
 I protected them from what I felt were bad influences, including, sadly, my brother, their Uncle Thomas, who had not been reformed in prison.
 He was an addict into horse racing.
 When my boys were in grammar school, our neighbor asked me who the man was who came to our home during the day while we were at work.
 He said that this guy, sometimes with another man, would enter our house through the garage with the keypad code.

I felt tears collecting in the corners of my eyes as I reached out and touched the nearest tree.
 It was as if the world I'd known my entire life had been simply a moldy cover designed to hide the true nature of my surroundings.
 Now the mask was gone and I was immersed in vivid colors, living lights, and a sense of harmony so strong it nearly overwhelmed me.
 It was impossible to say for certain how long I sat looking at the gentle motion of the tree branches, marveling at the way things made up of light could still cast shadows when silhouetted by the harsher light of the sun.
 Only somehow the sun had disappeared, replaced by the paler, colder light of the moon.
 The trees were still graceful strands of light, but the breeze had changed to a harsh thing, one carrying new scents that somehow represented danger.
 Something inside me forced my limbs into motion.
 I was running before the first howl tore through the night.
 I was moving unimaginably fast, jumping fallen trees and bounding over other obstacles which even my improved vision struggled to make out in time for me to avoid them.
 The speed of my passage wrung tears from my eyes, but I didn't dare slow.

We can bring all of Dezrel under our control and declare victory for Karak.”
 Qurrah stood, his eyes glimmering with anticipation.
 “Where will we strike first?”
 “Woodhaven is a symbol of cooperation between races.
 That must be ended.
 We will burn Veldaren to ash thereafter.
 Once all of Neldar is in chaos, we may proceed however we wish.”
 “Will we strike the elves?” Qurrah asked.

Jordaan pointed at the newly wrapped package and said, “Excuse me, but can I see that?” Rodregas nodded and curiously handled the half wrapped pack over to the Nymph wondering what had captured his attention.
 The Nymph slowly laid the package on the bed and unwrapped it.
 His hand passed over the contents in a motion similar to what he had done while working on Rodregas.
 To Rodregas’ surprise he stopped at the small toy frog.
 Jordaan glanced over to him as if asking for permission and Rodregas nodded his ok. Jordaan reached down and carefully picked up the small frog and cupped it in his hands.
 His eyes were closed in concentration.
 He looked up at Rodregas with a confused expression and asked, “Do you know what this is?” “Not really, I found it in Raven Keep.
 It felt of magic so I took it.
 I thought it might be worth something.” Jordaan smiled and laughed as he said, “Worth something indeed.

It is hard for me as they tell me their horrific stories of a life we once lived.
 They tell me it is great to talk to someone who understands what they are experiencing as a parent.
 Most have no one who can relate so they keep their family secret and they try to figure out what to do just as we did.
 I don’t judge them.
 My mother used to say, “I’ll always love you, but sometimes I don’t like you.” I now know exactly what she meant, as I felt that often as a father.
 Otherwise why would I have done what I did, but for love?
 Brandon’s life was worth saving and as ill prepared as I was to help in many ways, I helped in the only way I could.
 Our son now works at Narconon full time.
 He shares an offsite mobile home with up to six roommates at a time.
 They have one bathroom but it doesn’t seem to bother him in the least.

We are not Scientologists, but honestly I didn’t care who was running the program.
 I had heard my fair share of opinions and criticism of this religion but it just didn’t outweigh the other options.
 “Honestly,” I told Lisa, “I don’t care if he comes out with a shaved head and a pony tail selling incense at the airport, as long as he comes out clean and sober with the ability to deal with his addiction.” She agreed.
 As we put one foot in front of the other, his journey would begin, hour-by-hour followed by a day then a week and hopefully he would embrace the program and discover whatever was causing his self-destructive behavior.
 Early on, I had many phone calls and up-dates from the staff of the rehab center as to Brandon’s progress, some good and most bad.
 He craved this drug and he would say anything to get it.
 He would claim he was in extreme pain and he needed a doctor or anything as an excuse to escape to the outside world.
 These counselors had heard it all before; as former drug addicts they had used the same tactics.
 He was an adult and could leave the rehab center anytime he wanted, but the staff was well trained in convincing him otherwise.
 Everyone I talked to at Narconon had been through the program themselves and were former addicts.

He is a cowardly man, and fears the elves already.
 I played a large part in his decision to banish the elves from the city.

 The man in black gestured to the city nestled against the forest.
 “This city has long been treated neutral, even though it resides within Neldar’s border.

 In fact, I suspect that many of the Fir'shan actually develop gifts but never realize it because they're of a less powerful nature, and are mistaken for luck, or uncommonly sharp instincts.

 I gasped as I realized what Alec must have suspected for quite some time.
 "You mean that was really him in my dreams?"
 "Indeed.
 That's part of why he was so concerned you might be a powerful Fir'shan posing as a normal human."
 A tiny sound just outside the door preempted my next question.
 Alec carefully maneuvered a pair of huge metal baskets in through the door.

In silence, Harruq Tun stared at the body.
 Seven, he guessed.
 No older than seven.
 He didn’t know the boy’s name or why he had wandered into the forest.
 The bloodied corpse was sprawled across the knotted roots of a tree, its innards spilled through a massive gash from shoulder to waist.
 The eyes remained open, their young innocence spoiled by a lingering look of horror.
 _You’re an orc, aren’t you?_
 Harruq snarled and shook his head.
 He shouldn’t have spoken to him.
 Shouldn’t have let him ask questions.

“Get her a drink,” someone commanded.
 I felt the hand in mine then, as it was pulled away, replaced with a glass.
 I grimaced; I doubted I could hold a glass up, let alone myself.
 “Don’t worry, it’s only water,” someone reassured me.
 At the word, I realized I was parched, bone dry.
 I forced myself up, keeping my eyes tight as I concentrated on getting the glass to my lips.
 They were rough, cracked; I could feel them against the rim of the glass.
 I wondered if it was dried blood or if I had been down so long they’d simply split.
 I drank the full glass and felt it exchanged for another.
 I finished it as well and started to lean back.

I hadn’t even heard him come in.
 He was sitting forward on the bench next to me and when I jerked up in surprise, it put us too close.
 I tottered and he steadied me, but didn’t move away.
 He leaned closer.
 “You smell… like morning.” I bit my lip, heat rising up my neck, but he lingered, breathing in the scent.
 “Ruby,” I said.
 He looked confused.
 “Soap.” I had been reduced to one-word sentences.
 “Oh.” He nodded, leaning back.
 “She does have a way with potions and such.” “I enjoy the mixing,” Ruby said, startling me again as she entered the house.

He had been living on less since he was on lock-down and that was lowering the level in the tests, but he was really never without Oxy.
 It was late 2008 and my business was suffering the effects of the economic meltdown.
 Just a couple of years before that my business income had been five times what it was then.
 Bryce, in college, was working three jobs to pay his own expenses, something we could no longer afford to help with.
 Simply put, we were falling behind on everything and we didn’t have the money to put Brandon in a rehab; so we began searching the internet for someplace that would take him without an exorbitant amount of cash.
 The State run agencies were crammed with voluntary admissions and court ordered treatment.
 Brandon’s girlfriend, Tiffanie had already been in a thirty-day rehab twice before.
 We had heard plenty of horror stories from her about her stint in the county rehab: Apparently, several people had over-dosed on drugs while in the facility, one had died, and she had relapsed and used Oxy while she was in there.
 The problem with a facility that accepts court ordered patients is that the patient doesn’t want to be there.
 They are basically given the option of jail or rehab and they make the clear choice.

Steel smacked where he had been.
 Now on his back, Harruq tossed the sword in front of himself, clutching the hilt with both hands.
 The orc smashed his own blade downward, and as they connected, Harruq did not feel fear or the strain of his muscles.
 He felt exhilarated.
 Even though the orc pressed with all his strength, he could not force the kill.
 At last, Harruq forced him back, and in the brief opening he spun his sword around and buried half the blade into the orc’s gut.
 The orc gasped something unintelligible, dropped his other sword, and fell limp.
 Harruq stared at the body, his hands shaking from the excitement and his breath thunderous in his ears.

 I couldn’t help but wonder, “You were a bit… stunned before?” He flushed a pleasing shade of red.
 “Yes.” “Why?” “Well, it’s just that you are quite beautiful.
 Surely the loveliest thing I have ever seen.” I smiled in spite of myself and he continued the flattery.
 “And then when you spoke, your voice… it’s like a melody.” “And you are seeking a new camp?” “A more permanent settlement, actually.” “You have found it here?” “We are undecided.
 Days ago we were attacked.” Pain washed his features.

Not all countries in the region experienced all five shocks.
 Those that were spared proved better able to sustain output and real incomes.
 Czechoslovakia had not suffered from inflation and was largely free of external debt.
 Hungary, which had decentralized its economy and had introduced significant elements of the market in production and investment before 1989, was not subject to the sudden shocks due to import liberalization and termination of planning.
 Lessons from the Reform
 The failure of the transition strategy to produce the anticipated results has given rise to extreme hardship, growing anxiety, frustration and anger within these countries.
 Internationally, it has generated intense debate about the reasons for the failure, the efficacy of ‘shock therapy’, and the appropriateness and adequacy of Western assistance.
 These questions reflect an inadequate understanding, both within and outside the region, of the stages and process and essential conditions for an effective transition under the circumstances prevalent in Eastern Europe at the time.
 Understanding of this failure holds the key not only to the rapid revitalization of the former Soviet and other Eastern European republics, but also to meeting the challenges of present and future transitions in Africa, Asia and the West.
 This understanding can be summarized in the form of several lessons that can be derived from the general experience of countries in the region.

I wasn't sure why I was so anxious; usually I avoided crowds like the plague.
 Maybe I was just trying to prolong our time together.
 I let go as soon as we reached the fringe of the crowd, and prayed it was only my imagination that made me think Brandon was just the slightest bit relieved.
 Luckily there was plenty to distract me.
 It looked like there'd been some kind of war behind the school.
 The flagpole had a massive dent in its base, and actually looked like it was leaning slightly to one side.
 The straggly grass, kept just barely alive by the nearly non-existent rain and infrequent watering by some anonymous grounds keeper, had been torn up.
 Large patches of reddish dirt had been exposed and the ground was scarred by gouges that looked like they'd been made by some kind of farm machinery except for being so irregular.
 My eyes were momentarily pulled back to the ground.
 Something about the gouges was tickling the back of my mind.

 The sophomore she was helping looked like he wanted to be anywhere other than trying to figure out how long it would take Sally to mow the lawn given a certain width of lawn mower moving at a given rate of speed.
 "Oh, Adriana.
 Go ahead and walk around looking for students who need help.
 Most everyone will leave in the next ten minutes or so, but we're actually open for another hour."
 She was right.
 Nearly everyone left over the next little while as they either finished up their assignments, gave up, or finally filled whatever quota of study time they'd been given by their parents.
 I did get to answer a couple of questions, which was surprisingly fun.
 When there was only half an hour left Mrs. Campbell walked over.

"She's right, about how beautiful you look, Dom, if not about how pretty she is.
 James is going to pant when he sees you."
 Rachel had started prepping for the dance early, doing first her own makeup, and then Jasmin's while I was still gone with Alec.
 By the time I'd returned, Rachel's youthful features had taken on a mature cast that'd make all kinds of boys wish they'd taken a risk and asked Alec's little sister out.
 Jasmin had about the least reason out of any girl alive to be an expert hair dresser since her naturally wavy hair could just air dry and still look like she'd spent hours working on it, but an expert she was.
 The results of her efforts on Rachel's behalf were nothing less than spectacular, and the casual-looking knot of curls and twists was wispy in all the right places.
 Even with Rachel currently an order of magnitude hotter than normal, Jasmin still captured the prize.
 Rachel's work on her behalf had resulted in a makeup job that was so incredibly understated, even us girls had a hard time detecting it.
 Her wavy brunette hair had been straightened and pulled back in what looked like an attempt to let some other girls shine for a change, but it just made her look like a goddess who'd decided to spend the night slumming.
 Given who she'd spent the last hour being surrounded by, it was no wonder Dominic was worried she was the ugly step sister.

After experiencing such intense, barely restrained violence, I was starting to see just how ludicrous that'd been.
 People had already died over what was going on here.
 It hadn't been real, either because I hadn't examined Simon and Nathanial's lifeless bodies, or maybe because I was repressing the experience like I'd done with so many other parts of my life lately.
 I could feel my mind trying to shut down, hoping to cushion me from the worst implications of what was coming.
 I knew it was going to be bad, could feel it in a sickening, only-seconds-away-from-vomiting kind of way, but couldn't follow the chain of logic through to the very end.
 I let Jasmin help me pull my books together, and then numbly followed her out to the hallway.
 Alec and the rest of the pack were waiting for us at my locker.
 Jasmin calmly opened my locker and put my things away while I was still trying to come to terms with everything.
 Alec took my hand.

He was probably wondering how Rodregas could be strong enough to take on an Immortal Guard.
 Rodregas knew from the guard’s fear that he had him, he was not thinking clearly.
 Rodregas growled at him, letting him feel his anger and rage at taking slaves to be used by the Immortalists.
 Rodregas had seen what would happen to them.
 He had suffered for years with a subtle kind of inner rot at letting the evil continue.
 In all the ways that mattered Rodregas knew he was no better than this man, he had spent most of his life as a slaver.
 Rodregas had no moral grounds on which to kill these men, but inside of him there was no mercy.
 He had crossed a line and could no longer live with the evil.
 Rodregas let go of the guard’s shield.
 He did not have the angle to grab his opponent’s throat.

I didn't realize I was crying until I tried to talk.
 It was embarrassing, but was I too worried about being sent away to care.
 Any amount of ridicule would be worthwhile if it meant being able to stay with Alec.
 He obviously still wasn't convinced though.
 "Adri, you don't understand.
 This is the only way to keep you safe.
 I can't protect you here.
 I can't even protect my own family."
 He was still trying to disengage my arms from around his neck, but it was obvious he didn't want to hurt me, and I was holding on with everything I had.

“Why did you save me?”
 He kicked his toes into the dirt, unable to piece together the chaotic mess inside his head and heart.
 All he could think of was what his brother had told him to do.
 “Qurrah said to kill you if I didn’t love you…”
 “Yet you didn’t,” she said.
 Harruq nodded, but said nothing else.
 “ _Hana fael!_ ” a voice cried from far down the alley.
 Both turned to see an elf raise his bow and fire.

 Seth walked over to join us.
 “We should get moving and find somewhere else to stay.
 If we stay and argue in the forest, something worse is bound to find us.” “Right, lead the way,” I said and pushed off the tree.
 Seth nodded and I walked beside him as he led us, once again, through the woods.

He freed them and now he has found a rich place for them to rear their young if they are pregnant from the mating.
 But with beasts like that, you are either in charge or you are game.
 I think that he probably did the right thing.
 No way to know for sure, but they did not rip him apart, so we will say he was very brave and not very stupid.” Then he added, “Of course, if you had asked me before hand, I would have said that taking food from a Dire Cat was a very stupid idea.” He finished with a smile full of sharp teeth almost a match for the lions and in a casual movement lowered his horned head in what Rodregas thought might be his equivalent of a shrug.
 The next morning they repeated the Morning Prayer and meditation ritual.
 This time while Doi’van joined in, Imeralda mostly watched.
 Afterwards Rodregas said to both, “I have been thinking that we are probably going to be here a few weeks while I finish healing up from the knife wound.
 I want to make the most of the time.” Doi’van said, “I have a feeling that you have some sort of training in mind.” Rodregas nodded and said, “I have developed some bad habits the last few years; I know my technique is rusty and now my timing is all off with my new body.
 I am not sure what your training backgrounds are, though.” He said, waving at Imeralda, who often of late was holding her Black Yew bow close with an intimacy that spoke more of a caress than holding a weapon, “Clearly, Imeralda likes the bow.” Rodregas continued, “Even though Imeralda plans to stay out of the middle of things, learning some basic hand-to-hand and sword fighting is a good idea.
 Doi’van and I can spar with each other, which will help us get used to fighting against the sigil warriors of The Immortal Guard.

“Hey, Ruby, are there any castles around here?” The caravan stopped as everyone turned to stare at me.
 I had no idea what I’d said wrong.
 I must have given away the fact that I had no clue where I was.
 It wasn’t my fault.
 I’d never left the village.
 I didn’t know anything about anything.
 She glanced to the watching eyes and again to me.
 I was sure they were waiting for something.
 “Well, it’s just that I remember reading in the village about castles in the North.” Was I supposed to have read that?

Neither logic nor self-interest justify a detached attitude or a half-hearted effort to address this issue.
 As in the case of the recent global response to the threat of global warming from depletion of the ozone layer, it simply is not acceptable for us to remain indifferent or claim that we are powerless to act where the entire world’s vital self-interests are at stake.
 When war threatens a nation’s borders, technology threatens its environment or unemployment threatens the livelihood of its people and the fabric of its social existence, there is only one acceptable response – that is, action.
 The greatest achievement of this century has not been technological, economic or political, but rather the growing concern and intolerance for the slaughter, persecution or impoverishment of other human beings.
 This marks the awakening of our collective, human consciousness to the full value of human life and the consequent rejection of physical strength, political power and money as the governing values of society.
 This evolution of consciousness has led to monumental changes in the accepted rules of social existence.
 Slavery and colonialism were abolished because society evolved to the point where it would no longer tolerate them – not for economic reasons, but because they were a disgraceful blot on the conscience of humanity.
 Similarly, the acceptance of famine, poverty and unemployment as necessary or inevitable by-products of economic life should no longer and need no longer be tolerated.
 Social charity and welfare were necessary inventions to mitigate the worst effects of economic development over the past few centuries, but they are signs of a defective system that humiliate the recipients and deprive them of self-respect, rather than equipping them with the capacity and self-confidence to help themselves.
 As freedom has finally been recognized as an inalienable right of every human being, we are fast approaching the time when society must recognize and ensure the right of every individual to gainful employment.

He stared down a particular street for a long while before closing his eyes.

I went to the section which would most likely house the desired information, and then closed my eyes and concentrated.
 Maybe it wouldn’t work, but I could try.
 I wasn’t sure I felt anything, but after a few minutes I imagined my right hand might have tingled a little.
 I grabbed a close volume and leafed through it.
 It was a legacy of the Viridian Forest clan.
 I pulled another volume down.
 A diary of Momar the Ancient.
 I sighed.
 This was going to be like trapping a greased pixie.

 We both sat there in silence for a few seconds as everything sank in, and then Mom exploded into motion.
 She ran downstairs to repack her photography equipment, all the while yelling upstairs to verify that I'd packed all of the other essentials she was going to need.
 Almost before I'd even finished assimilating how quickly Alec had pulled everything together, Mom was backing down the lane as I waved goodbye.

My first kegger had just officially started.
 Cassie showed up in a white pickup a few minutes after the beer started flowing, and popped the panel covering the bed, revealing an astounding row of speakers that promptly started spewing an aggressive mix of drums, guitars and synthesized notes that made Brandon's usual mixes sound like Christmas carols.
 In short order there was a roaring fire going, despite the fact it wasn't really cold yet, and people started congregating in groups to talk or dance depending on their preference.
 Brandon seemed to be one of the former.
 Dragging along behind him as he slowly worked his way through a third of the school was extremely boring.
 I honestly couldn't think of a less entertaining way to spend an evening, but I wasn't ready to join the dancers.
 Most of them seemed to be rapidly losing key items of clothing, and all of them were dancing so close it was hard to tell where one person ended and the other began.
 As Brandon handed me another cup of beer, which I started slowly pouring out on the ground as soon as his back was turned, the loneliness really started to hit me.
 It would be bearable if I had a friend other than Brandon.
 It might even be fun to sit back and laugh at some of the antics making an appearance as people got more and more wasted.

But it is equally true that ‘shock therapy’ never could have been implemented by a democratic government, when it imposed such enormous hardship on the people and generated a polarization and fragmentation of political forces within the country.
 Where similar strategies have succeeded in other parts of the world, it has usually been under authoritarian governments, such as in Chile.
 Where force is not possible, the only viable alternative is to build social consensus in support of the reform strategy.
 Ultimately, the success of the reform measures will be determined by one factor – the extent to which the people understand, accept and are motivated to act under the new system.
 Before introducing any new measure, maximum effort should be made to communicate its purpose and nature to the people and win their understanding and approval.
 Public education is the most powerful policy instrument.
 With public opinion widely divided over the best course of action, it is necessary to win back the understanding, support and endorsement of the population for an alternative programme which the major parties and social groups can back.
 This requires educating the public to understand both the costs and benefits involved in any reform strategy, the trade-offs between immediate advantages and immediate sacrifices required to establish a new and stable equilibrium.
 3.Economic strategy must be balanced: A market economy can be introduced gradually or step-wise, but it cannot be introduced in a fragmentary or piecemeal manner.
 Deregulation of prices was the most prominent feature of the strategy in most countries, because it was the easiest to implement.

Thus, the costs92m and0m92m benefits0m required92m to0m operate a market economy should92m exclusively0m be spent by the government.<eop> As you can see, the private sector has a significant share of the costs arising92m from0m operating<cls>

But with the two of them the oath seemed different, more easily said and with no need for threats.
 Rodregas was not sure why, but he decided it was something to think about when he had more time.
 The rest of the night passed quickly as Rodregas did his best to bandage his stomach wound.
 He did not think the knife had cut into anything too important; at least it was not bleeding too badly.
 He was surprised that he was not more tired; maybe his new body handled such things better and could make do with less sleep.
 He was usually a light sleeper and was very surprised that they had been able to get the drop on him.
 His guess was that the AElf maiden had cast some sort of spell on him to mask their approach, and he kept a close eye on her to make sure she did not repeat the effort.
 Of course she was also very nice to look at, so he did not need much of an excuse to enjoy the view.
 In the morning, he slowly pulled out some of the supplies and bundled them.

Hands stretched to the heavens, the cloaked man laughed.
 His power surged with the laughter, obliterating Qurrah’s ability to stand._

And when dad said goodbye to us, he put a hand tentatively on my shoulder, before letting me go.
 It was the most he ever touched me, you know, that generation, those dads, not the down-on-the-carpet kind of parents.
 But that crappy paint store.
 Man.
 It was killing him, boring him silly.
 But, he came home every night with a grin on his face.
 Ate dinner with us, spot on 4:45, like you could set your fucking watch by it, and then, evenings when he played, he’d sheepishly pick up his little case, which usually sat in the back closet next to his shoe tree, and he would toss off a sad smile and go play till God knows what hour.

He didn’t hear the reasons why and didn’t want to know.
 The idea of so much money, more than enough to buy warm food and clean drink, kept him there.
 At last it was his turn, and he approached the table where Alvrik sat chewing on a piece of bone long since void of meat.
 “You,” he said before Harruq could mutter a word.
 “You don’t look like all the others.”
 “I’m not like the others.”

I do not want blood spilled this day.”
 A single elf approached.
 He was dressed in a long green cloak, silvery armor, and he bore his bow openly.
 Antonil could barely make out his features, since he was so far down the street.
 The elf halted, drew an arrow, and fired it into the air.
 It smacked the dirt an inch from Antonil’s foot.
 Sergan shook his head and stared in wonder at his commander.

My face pulled back in a smile, I even brought my hand partway up in a wave before I realized I recognized her.
 It was the trendy girl from the office, and she apparently still didn't like me.
 I felt my face get even hotter, only now I was both angry and embarrassed.
 It was a relief to sink down into a chair with my back to Brandon and his friends.
 Strangely enough, Britney also being so obviously uncomfortable helped calm me down.
 "Okay, out with it, why is this such a big deal?"
 Britney shifted back and forth in her seat for a couple of seconds before leaning in to whisper.
 "It really shouldn't be a big deal, but everyone around here acts like it's taboo.
 Two hikers were killed by some kind of wild animal a few months ago."

“Come, Sonowin,” the elf said to his cherished companion.
 “Let us leave this place while it is still in peace.”
 The beautiful creature neighed in agreement.

“If something like that is on the entrance, I want to know where this goes.” “I agree but aren't we supposed to be trying to find Emily and Jason?” “I have an idea,” I said and pulled my bow off my back.
 I removed one of my arrows and put my bow on the ground.
 I walked over to Seth and pulled his sword out of its sheath.
 He grabbed for it but I already had it in my hands.
 I put the tip against the arrow and carved the same sign as the one on the wall.
 Then I tossed Seth's sword back at him, which he caught without a problem, and picked up my bow.
 I notched the carved arrow and released it.
 It whizzed up and out of sight.
 “There, now they'll know how to find us.” Seth whistled.

It slipped down the sky, allowing the first stars to peek out from behind the bright curtain.
 The remaining light cast shadows over everything, creating the illusion that there was double of everything.
 The world prepared to go into its hours of unreal silence that made it seem magical, and it really was.
 My phone buzzed and I awoke from my trance.
 I thumbed the keypad and opened the message Seth had sent me.
 It read: Whatcha Doing?
 I flipped open the pad and wrote: Walking home.
 I shoved it back in my pocket and continued walking.
 The sun was almost gone and shadows were starting to appear behind everything.

That night, Velixar gave them their orders, putting in motion his plan to blanket the east in war.
 “In Celed there is a male elf by the name of Ahrqur Tun’del,” he told the two under the cover of stars.
 “He has visited King Vaelor before, and was quite vocal when the elves were expelled from his capital city.
 He is well known in Woodhaven, at least to those of elven blood.
 I need him killed and his body brought before me.”
 “How will we hide the body?” asked Harruq.
 “Wrap it in cloth and make sure you are not seen,” Velixar said.
 “And make no mistakes.”
 “We will not,” Qurrah said.

I saw distrust flash in his eyes but he gave me a weak smile.
 We turned to face the monsters heading for us.
 Seth charged ahead, slicing Thrashers and Frost Beasts.
 I notched an arrow and released it.
 It soared into a swamp toll's head, making it shout out in agony.
 Seth spun around and plunged his sword into the troll's side.
 It gave a screech and fell to the floor, dead.
 Emily raised her hands and vines shot from the ground and wrapped around a troll that had tried to crush Seth.
 I aimed an arrow at its chest and the troll fell to the ground next to the others.
 The last beast fell, dead from Jason's knife, and we all took in a deep breath.

Yet here she was running her hands all over the back of a man she'd known only a week.
 Was it a difference in morals?
 Or times?
 Or was it Rick?
 She'd never known a man so warm and kind and open.
 Feeling a surge of affection, she slid her arms around his waist, laying her cheek against his back.
 "How does that feel?"
 "Better than you could ever imagine."
 He sucked in his breath, standing perfectly still.
 He didn't want to be released from her embrace.

It is one of the reasons I am prized for my potential with more than one power.
 My AElven ancestry is strong with mortal magic, but my Nymph side is strong in elemental magic.
 If an Immortalist takes my power, he or she could become stronger in both.” “Mostly correct,” Jordaan said.
 “It is actually a topic of much debate among magicians.
 I go along with the belief that there is no such thing as ‘mortal’ magic.
 While we don’t have time now to go over all the proof, the general thought is that mortals are truly just animals and don’t produce magic.
 It is only our connection to other realms that provides us power.
 Mana is the raw energy of magic no matter what its source.
 You can use mana from any source to cast spells.” He looked around at the three of them to make sure they understood.

The elven brothers tumbled through and vanished.
 Felewen leapt back when she saw the attack coming.
 She rolled behind a house and tucked her head.
 The wave continued down the street, straight for Aurelia.
 “I do not fear you,” she hissed through clenched teeth.
 A wall of water swirled about her, flowing from the otherwise dry dirt street.
 She sent it forward, just as tall and high as Velixar’s.
 The two met in a thunderous roar, intermixing in a maelstrom of darkness, water, and air.

My wavering vision was just up to making out the outline of Rachel's present where I'd left it on the table.
 Feeling incredibly ungrateful and thoughtless, I limped over to the table and tore open the delicate wrapping paper.
 It was a copy of the latest Les Misérables movie, complete with the score from the most recent Broadway production, and a signed picture of the entire cast.
 Mom still wasn't home by the time it got dark, but I went to bed truly happy for the first time in ages.
 Rachel was the best friend a girl could wish for, and Brandon had come through in spades.

The battering continued, and long days of constant fighting were making me tired.
 We took a break and I leaned back on a rock, staring at the sky as I rested.
 Chevelle walked me to the edge of a tall peak.
 The rock mountain ended in a sheer cliff, straight down into haze.
 He looked into my eyes like he saw something there, like he really knew me.
 We gazed out over the cliff, at the horizon… endless.
 I felt his hand on my back and closed my eyes, relaxing into the comfortable, familiar feel of it.
 He pushed me with full force.
 I flew off the cliff, falling straight down.
 I stared back at him as he stood, watching me fall, nothing but open sky above and below.

They returned to their rooms that night tired; they had tracked down twelve more squires.
 All had at least two ribbons; and all swore secrecy at the source of their sigil.
 The biggest surprise was probably Geriodon, who had beaten Rodregas earlier that day.
 Rodregas could not argue against sharing the minor sigil as he clearly fit the description of a worthy candidate.
 Geriodon was more than happy to swear that he had no love for the Guild and that Justice should be dealt to all equally.
 But before accepting the sigil he wanted to be sure that any Shadow Order he joined was mostly about secrecy to protect themselves, and that he would still be able to compete for true knighthood in the Order of the Soaring Heavens.
 Rodregas dropped into his cot tired and exhausted.
 Even with his healing sigil he had needed a full night’s rest, but duty did not wait for what a man needed.
 Imeralda woke him slightly after dawn, and Rodregas could tell that both she and Doi’van had spent the few hours left of the night working on what was left of their equipment.

It was likely the discomfort was more due to the subject matter than the chair, but I just couldn't get comfortable.
 I finally moved my books over to the bed and sprawled out on it.
 Spanish, Math, History, Biology, English.
 The subjects all blurred together as the hours passed by in a blur of academic exhaustion.
 I wanted to go to sleep long before dark, but couldn't justify it, so I just kept grinding along.
 I'd long ago learned that changing subjects and studying something new was almost as good as a break, so I swapped out books on a regular basis, and persevered despite increasingly-frequent head bobs.
 The attack came as a complete surprise.
 One moment I was quietly studying, an instant later hordes of shape shifters were pouring into the mansion.

“Doing okay?” “Uh-huh.” I decided to take the opportunity; I had a dozen questions since reading the diary.

 I must have given away the fact that I had no clue where I was.
 It wasn’t my fault.

When the moment arrived for this evening’s three graduates to speak, a young lady in her early twenties walked to the front of the room with her head down.
 When she looked up, she smiled nervously.
 She had no family present.
 She told everyone how her mother told her how ugly she was her whole life and told her she was worthless, how she attempted to numb the pain with the drugs she took.
 How she became addicted to the drugs, and prostituted herself to pay for her habit.
 She said that she took all the drugs she could because she knew she would never be alive to see her twenty-first birthday.
 She smiled and announced that she was now twenty-one.
 She thanked one staff member after another and one student after another, each for something specific they had contributed to her healing.
 She said she now felt worthwhile, beautiful and confident.

And after the second time I chose North Beach over her company, Gloria informed me her former boyfriend had returned on leave from the Marines.
 We shouted at each other long-distance and parted.
 Eric still didn’t have a girlfriend.
 I had decided he didn’t want to hurt dozens of girls by choosing another over them.
 Too soon, I would learn about other reasons.
 Girls adored him.
 They phoned at all hours, even risking Sylvia’s wrath, and they tailed him through the halls of our school.
 But if he had even kissed one of them, he kept it secret.
 A favorite of his, along with Margaret and Pam, was Carol, who had been his companion at Carmen Ranch club until their mystery afternoon together.

Somewhere around this time, I decided to try and find my biological father, Richard, a natural thing for a young man my age to want to do, right?
 So I tracked him down and called him.
 Richard was living in Arkansas and had been for many years.
 We talked on the phone and upon discovering he would be near our homes on a business trip, arranged a meeting at a hotel—with Thomas too.
 Thomas begged out at the last minute, and without contacting Richard I brought my friend Bill with me for the drive into the bay area.
 When I knocked on the door of the hotel room, my father opened the door looked at me, called me Thomas, and then he looked at Bill and called him by my name.
 He didn’t even know what his own kids looked like.
 We spent a brief time in the hotel room getting our names and heritage correct then we were off to dinner.
 During the dinner, Richard asked if I could “score some toot” which I discovered meant find cocaine.
 Well, I didn’t need to look much past my pocket to score, so we ended up getting drunk and snorting toot to commemorate our father and son reunion.

Of course, even today women stayed with men who abused them, and it would have been much harder for a woman in the 1920s to escape.
 But why had she married him?
 Had she not seen what type of man he was?
 He turned back to the picture.
 The article had said that she’d been vibrant and fun-loving in her youth, and he could see those qualities in her eyes.
 He would have liked to have known her.
 Well, before her marriage, anyway.
 He’d bet that she’d been a lot less complicated than the women he knew.
 And she was so beautiful.

 She was the one who had to come back.
 She shot the final guards with the Black Yew bows.
 She was no warrior but had gone back with only a few arrows and rescued them.
 She had patched them up, rounded up the rescued slaves and sought a refuge.
 “Are you insane?” she asked them in a voice that was as cold as her anger.
 Imeralda, her voice dripping scorn, added, “It was only because one of the slaves had family at the local village that we were able to find this refuge.

It was just heart wrenching, man, I mean, we were just like two kids given a new lease on life.
 I wrote a song, I kept, thinking.
 I wrote a damn good song.
 I was back, you know, back, but different.
 Different but the same.
 This is what I want everyone to understand.
 What I want to say—the difference is not a drama, the difference is a poem, a song, a way of looking at life, that’s slightly atilt, slightly askew, perhaps, but it’s all me, you know?

The progress it heralds is no more inconceivable and remarkable than the chain of recent achievements seemed seven years ago – yet those we have already come to take for granted and, underinsistent prodding by the media, to replace in our consciousness with ever new concerns.
 PROSPECTS FOR THE YEAR 2005
 According to the provisions of international treaty, the final batch of nuclear weapons has been destroyed, ushering in a world free of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
 Global military spending has fallen by nearly 50 per cent since 1994 to $400 billion per annum (in 1990 US dollars), half of which is now contributed to a global military force responsible for enforcing a total ban on war between nations.
 Not a single inter-state or civil war is raging due to the extension of the UN's mandate to prevent all forms of war and its vastly strengthened military capabilities.
 International drug trafficking has declined by more than 80 per cent since the signing of the UN declaration granting the UN special powers to eradicate the drugs trade.
 An accelerated schedule for dismantling trade barriers and the formation of regional economic unions, such as the Middle East Economic Area that incorporates Israel and the Arab states, and other initiatives to promote larger bilateral trade between countries and regions, have helped to more than double the growth rate in world trade.
 With the assistance of the UN's World Development Force, proposed in this report, food shortages have been eliminated from the last famine danger zones in Africa, and total food production on that continent has doubled within a decade.
 Poverty is its direct forms has been eradicated in China and India by strategies that have led to the creation of hundreds of millions of new jobs.
 Rapid economic growth in developing countries has acted as a powerful engine for vigorous expansion among the industrialized nations.

"No, I'm fine, just a little worried about Jasmin and the boys."
 Now he did frown.
 He wasn't excited that he had to stay here instead of leading the tracking group.
 I personally was glad he couldn't go along, and not just because it was dangerous work.
 I wasn't positive he'd really come to terms with having killed Brandon.
 "They'll be fine.
 You need to worry about getting better, and nothing else."
 My pout met with just as much success as it usually did.
 After a second or two I gave up and nodded.

A part of me knew this was all stupid, but I couldn't shake the depression.
 I was just aware enough to register Brandon's concerned glances as he drove me into school.
 Mrs. Sorenson shot me a nasty look as I stumbled into class.
 "Well isn't it nice of you to come to class today.
 And here we all thought you were doing so well you didn't need to bother with the test."
 I took the proffered test and made my unsteady way back to my desk.
 The class passed in a blur as I made a half-hearted attempt to focus on the questions and remember all kinds of facts about photosynthesis that I'd known just a few days before.
 It was useless.
 The separate pieces of information skittered about on the edge of my memory without ever becoming tangible enough to relate to the answer I needed.

You got academics plumbing rock music now for the kind of meanings they dug out of Wordsworth and Coleridge.

When my boys were in grammar school, our neighbor asked me who the man was who came to our home during the day while we were at work.
 He said that this guy, sometimes with another man, would enter our house through the garage with the keypad code.
 We knew nothing of this!
 The neighbor described the car, and the description matched Thomas’s car.
 I showed him a family photo and he identified Thomas as the guy.
 When I searched my house I found liquid Hydrocodone prescribed for horses.
 Thomas had been using my house as his daytime drug den.
 When I confronted him, he denied it, and even went so far as to blame Brandon and Bryce.
 He threw his nephews under the bus to cover his ass.

He wasn’t the same to me anymore; he always had this mask on his face, hiding himself from the rest of us.

 I snapped back to attention, “Uh yes, I am Emily.

2.Resource allocation: Sudden dismantling of the central planning machinery responsible for the allocation of materials for current production and allocation of funds and materials for investment in these countries was another shock.
 It proved impossible in the majority of countries to create and organize, overnight, commodity and financial markets of sufficient depth and flexibility to substitute effectively for the planning machinery.
 3.Import liberalization: Drastic import liberalization led to the inflow of better-quality, lower-priced foreign goods that depressed demand for domestically produced goods.
 The shock impact of imports was aggravated by the fact that farmers in the region were forced to compete in some cases with subsidized agricultural products from the West.
 4.Privatization: Although the actual progress of privatization has been relatively slow in most instances, the uncertainty regarding the future status and ownership of enterprises and property has inhibited investment, slowed up current production, and led to widespread plunder of state property.
 5.Trade: As the socialist structure of these countries began to change and the political influence of the Soviet Union diminished, there was a huge drop in the trade between countries of the region, and, following the break-up of the USSR, between the republics of the Soviet Union as well.
 Not all countries in the region experienced all five shocks.
 Those that were spared proved better able to sustain output and real incomes.
 Czechoslovakia had not suffered from inflation and was largely free of external debt.
 Hungary, which had decentralized its economy and had introduced significant elements of the market in production and investment before 1989, was not subject to the sudden shocks due to import liberalization and termination of planning.

“Order them to march.

 “Yes, milord.”
 Sergan turned and started barking orders, all his calm and politeness vanishing.
 The guard captain glanced at the edict from the king he carried in his hand.
 A rash impulse filled him, an insane desire to tear the paper to shreds and return to his liege bearing a lie on his lips.
 Under normal circumstances the king would know no difference.
 His advisors, however, were many, and every one of them would betray Antonil for the chance to gain esteem in the eyes of the king.
 No, he would have to deliver the message, regardless of his desires.

 The goals of peace, prosperity and fulfilment for every human being represent formidable challenges – intellectual, attitudinal, organizational and technological.
 We cannot hope to reach such lofty achievements if we waste and squander the precious and abundant resources – mental, psychological, social and material – placed at our disposal.
 A massive reduction in emphasis on weapons production and military establishments, made possible by recent political events and demanded by the pressing unmet needs of people everywhere, represents both a great opportunity and a considerable challenge.
 The opportunity is not only further to reduce the threat of war by reducing the capacity for waging war, but also to redirect and utilize for other purposes the resources now dedicated to war making and prevention.
 The challenge is to do so at a time when rising unemployment and economic stagnation in many countries make further cuts in the size of the military unpopular domestically.
 Since 1990, the total number of military personnel worldwide has declined by two million or about six per cent.
 By 1998, a further decrease of at least two million is anticipated.
 A large proportion of these demobilized people have already joined, or will soon join, the forces of the unemployed.
 Some may be tempted to market their military skills elsewhere.

Then I dodged him and hustled back out to where Cliff and Billy leaned against the office wall, surrounded by tragedy groupies.
 The three of us escaped around the office building, down the front steps to the street, where we ran into Laura.
 Though in four years she would become my wife, I hardly knew her and didn’t realize yesterday was her birthday.
 She asked me to sit on the grass for a minute.
 Staring across the ball fields, she said, “Just last week he promised that for my birthday he was going to give me a very special present, only I wouldn’t understand it for a long, long time.
 So he goes and gets killed on my birthday.
 What’s that mean?” I shrugged.
 We hugged stiffly.
 Then we parted and went our own ways.

You never had to learn any control; your power was so weak that you always struggled simply to have enough power to do anything with it.” “Ok, I never learned proper control; the spells I learned as a squire were small weak things.
 But, can I learn control now?”  Rodregas asked.
 “Of course,” she responded.
 “But it will probably be harder and slower than if you were learning earlier in life.
 It requires relearning something that is almost an instinct at this point in your life.
 Part of the problem is that the spell to activate the magic in the bow is just very different than anything you have probably done before.” Rodregas knew she was speaking the truth.
 He had never thought he was going to be some powerful mage.
 The fact that Doi’van had so easily learned the spell just reminded him of how many times in his life he had failed to have the ability to succeed in things that he really wanted.
 Rodregas’ new body was very gifted, but it was still mortal and some things he would just not be able to do as well as others.
 In some ways this was reassuring, a connection to his past.

Junnie was across the room in a flash.
 She glanced at the changed thistle and then, briefly, me, but when I tried to meet her gaze, it shifted to the wall of books.
 “Well, good for you, Frey.
 Your efforts are finally paying off.” I stared blankly at her.
 “What do you say we wrap it up for today?
 I’ve got some business with Council.” I stumbled off the stool, half numb from being still so long, and made my way outside into the warm sun, unsure of my direction.
 The idea of lingering within sight of the village center didn’t have much appeal, but I was in no hurry to get back home to Fannie.
 Choosing instead a rambling, rarely used path out of the village, I found myself wandering idly through the trees and, eventually, into an abandoned, overgrown garden, where I tried to work out what to do with my now empty afternoon.
 Sitting surrounded by the various weeds, my tutor might have urged me to do something useful, like identify the species, but she wasn’t here, and I couldn’t help but attempt to repeat the process I’d used on the thistle in her study.
 I’d been warned not to practice without supervision, but the field felt alone as I concentrated on one weed and then on each of the others, spinning my charms in an attempt to develop them.

While it didn't sound like anyone was out-and-out yelling, they weren't the calm voices of friendly conversation.
 I quickly reversed direction, and found an external door less than a minute later.
 The voices had faded away to nearly nothing as I'd gotten further away from them, but all of a sudden they peaked into a full-blown yelling match, punctuated with an incredible crash that sent a tremor through the entire house.
 Any thoughts I'd had about trying to find a phone and calling 911 vanished as full flight instinct took a hold.
 A few seconds later I was outside and running.
 The moon was so obscured by clouds it provided only minimal light, but even the poor visibility couldn't convince me to slow my flight through the near jungle waiting outside the house.
 I could barely make out the stone path that led through the garden, but I stumbled along it as quickly as I could with my sprained ankle, deciding between branches in the path completely at random.
 I'd only been running for a few seconds when lightning tore its first gash in the night sky and opened up the way for a monsoon-like rainstorm.
 Within a few seconds the cold rain was falling so hard that I couldn't see even a few feet ahead of me.
 I started shivering instantly.

Imeralda asked, “Does that mean that in this room these are great sigils as well?
 Ones that require Infernal sourced magic to work?
 That kind of makes sense if you can have greater sigils that are the shapes of the Celestial Beasts.
 Why not daemons of the Infernal Realm as well?
 But what is the One Tree?
 It is not a beast of a realm, it is the symbol of the Nymph people.
 It can’t be a sigil, can it?” she asked.
 Neither Doi’van nor Rodregas answered and the three of them stood there, each caught up in their own thoughts.
 Finally, Doi’van spoke, “I am going to see what lies in this Chamber.
 Will you be alright?” he asked Imeralda.

He'd spent that evening and yesterday evening doing exactly what he was doing tonight: sitting in front of the TV, not seeing, not hearing, not moving.
 How could she have become so much a part of him in only five weeks?
 He'd been engaged to a woman who hadn't been as deeply imbedded in his heart and soul as Marie.
 How could his life ever be complete again without her?
 He wondered if she was feeling the same way.
 Was she finding that home wasn't the same as it had been before she'd fallen in love with him?
 Did she wonder how she could ever feel complete again?
 But no--she was dead!
 The agony of that realization pierced his numbed heart.
 This was 2011; she'd gone back to 1927, been reunited with her family, probably gotten married and had children.

“We'll head for the cave and stay there for the night,” Seth said.
 “Then we'll set off.” Emily crossed her arms.
 “Who made you in charge?” “You have a better idea, Emily?” Seth snorted.
 “Or maybe you'd prefer to sleep in the open.” “Uh I think I'll stay with that plan,” she said quickly.
 “But you're a grump Seth.” she pushed past him and headed the path to the cave.
 “You are, Seth,” I said.
 I followed Emily, with Jason and Seth on my heels.
 When we reached the blocked cave entrance, Seth drew his sword and sliced the vines apart.
 They fell to the ground and the cave was revealed.
 We walked inside the dimly lit space and I sighed in relief at some safety.

Confident, perhaps, but not foolish.

 “Yeah, I know,” Harruq said, growing quiet.
 The subject of Qurrah’s experiments always made him uneasy.
 “This time there will be a slight difference,” Qurrah said.
 “What’s that?”
 The half-orc shook his head.
 “Not now.
 Another time I will explain.”
 The two grew quiet, and they stared at the fire as the time passed.

Imeralda’s eyes lit up in pleasure and humor at his words but, of course, he was careful to say nothing of the future, nothing of love.
 Such talk would serve no purpose and would likely ruin the moment.
 To his surprise she also kept such thoughts to herself.
 The rest of the night, the two lovers spent quietly connected and at peace, but they shared few words.
 In the morning after meditation, Doi’van pulled forth two wooden staves that he had cut and said with a smile and an exaggerated wink, “Apparently you are healed up from your wound now, so I think it is time to stop with these making of shadows like children and time for some more physical training.” As he finished speaking he tossed Rodregas one of the staves.
 “With my people we teach our children to fight using the staff.
 It is hard to kill someone by accident with a staff, but you can still deliver pain.
 The avoidance of pain is a great way to teach someone to be nimble and quick.
 My war masters at the palace would say you two are too old to learn the staff, but it is the way that I know.” “Sir Paladin,” he said to Rodregas, imposing the unearned honor title.
 “I assume with your training from all your ex-knights that you know how to use the staff?” As Doi’van spoke he looked at how Rodregas was holding the staff.

I couldn’t fathom the pain Chevelle had suffered, surely a hundred times mine at the loss of my mother.
 His mother… his father… each member of his family?
 How much loss had he endured?
 Tears streamed down my face.
 Chevelle took a step toward me and I was struck by fear.
 He must despise me.
 That was why he’d become my watcher.
 He gave a curt nod at my reaction, his head still dipped as he walked away.
 I wanted to speak but the words choked me.

He realized that he was outclassed.
 Her skills were better than his own and Rodregas’ physical abilities were not so much greater than hers as to counter her superior fighting skills.
 For the first time in the tournament Rodregas lost control of the flow of the match as suddenly she moved in swinging hard.
 Then again, and again, she went in close with her shield wedging it in, and was able to lock it to his left for just a second.
 She swung hard at his open side; he had time to block her stroke but his sword shattered when the two swords collided.
 Her sword was at his throat before he could do anything and the officiating knight yelled a stop to the match, handing the yellow band to Karun and the white second place finish to Rodregas.
 Doi’van and Imeralda met him at the entrance to the cafeteria, Rodregas stalked in without looking at them and stood quietly in line to get his large bowl of stew and chunk of bread.
 They sat down away from where most of the other squires.
 The other two sat quietly until all three had finished the repast.

 “This was after the orcs attacked Veldaren about a year ago and busted up the walls.

But, then his mind went back again and again over his and Imeralda’s time during the last few weeks and then back to Doi’van’s words.
 He knew his friend spoke the truth, but he was not so sure about his ability to do what he needed to keep his relationship with the beautiful AElven Nymph.
 CHAPTER 11 THE NATURE OF BONDS
 The next few days Rodregas and Doi’van recovered quickly under the powerful healing magic of Jordaan.
 This is not to say Rodregas did not spend most of his time dreaming that the handsome young Nymph would head back to his own estates.
 They were staying in a small village that seemed to be mostly a forest with small rooms built into it.
 Rodregas could not figure out any set pattern to the place or its boundaries.
 There might have been a dozen or even hundreds of Nymphs living there.
 Though all the Nymphs were friendly, he was still eager to leave.
 Jordaan was doing one of his mystic checks, running his hand a foot above Rodregas’ reclining body.

 And I got my uke taken from me and a call was made to my parents.
 My mom hit the roof—she was the kind that got embarrassed by such things and that, to her, was the ultimate disgrace, to be shown up in front of other grownups.
 My mom threatened to smash my uke and Dad had to cool her down and, I think, it was later that night I got it back.
 I started right in, learning new songs.
 Thinking up new songs.
 I had this record player, you know, with the lid and the swivel arm made of plastic, and a stack of 45s, some I bought at Corondolet in a sealed stack—you know?
 Five 45s for $1, and you could only see the top one.

The progress it heralds is no more inconceivable and remarkable than the chain of recent achievements seemed seven years ago – yet those we have already come to take for granted and, underinsistent prodding by the media, to replace in our consciousness with ever new concerns.
 PROSPECTS FOR THE YEAR 2005
 According to the provisions of international treaty, the final batch of nuclear weapons has been destroyed, ushering in a world free of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
 Global military spending has fallen by nearly 50 per cent since 1994 to $400 billion per annum (in 1990 US dollars), half of which is now contributed to a global military force responsible for enforcing a total ban on war between nations.
 Not a single inter-state or civil war is raging due to the extension of the UN's mandate to prevent all forms of war and its vastly strengthened military capabilities.
 International drug trafficking has declined by more than 80 per cent since the signing of the UN declaration granting the UN special powers to eradicate the drugs trade.
 An accelerated schedule for dismantling trade barriers and the formation of regional economic unions, such as the Middle East Economic Area that incorporates Israel and the Arab states, and other initiatives to promote larger bilateral trade between countries and regions, have helped to more than double the growth rate in world trade.
 With the assistance of the UN's World Development Force, proposed in this report, food shortages have been eliminated from the last famine danger zones in Africa, and total food production on that continent has doubled within a decade.
 Poverty is its direct forms has been eradicated in China and India by strategies that have led to the creation of hundreds of millions of new jobs.
 Rapid economic growth in developing countries has acted as a powerful engine for vigorous expansion among the industrialized nations.

bla, my crack-berry rang.
 I looked at the caller ID and it was Steve’s number, not Ashley’s.
 This was even better since the goal was to get him and she was ancillary.
 I picked up the phone, which was still connected to the recording device, and she introduced herself and said she was calling from her boyfriend’s phone because hers was broken.
 The call went better than expected as you could hear Steve coaching her in the background.
 Ashley fell nicely into all of the comments the police wanted to record.
 I was told by Officer White to tell her I could meet her in a couple of days as I was out of town.
 I told her I would call her when I returned and after work hours.
 She agreed and the call ended.

There were supposed to be well over a hundred Immortalists in the Eastern Realms, each one incredibly powerful.
 What had happened today was pure luck and unlikely to be repeated.
 Trying to tear apart the Immortalists and their powerful guild was a near impossible task.
 Ravenhurr had been known as a powerful Immortalist, but nothing compared to Guild Master Oreintvenir or the Immortalist Guild Dealer Taiga.
 They had been slowly rising in power for centuries on their path to true godhood.
 Rumor was that the Guild Master (and maybe Taiga as well) was close to ascension to true godhood.
 Only two Immortalists had ever succeeded in this task.
 The first was the legendary Accerntorino.
 He was said to have created the Immortalist Ascension ritual and to have been a genius without par.

 But for some reason, the young woman from the 1920s was still very much on his mind.

The pain was easier to manage knowing that at least he was still in the running for the tournament championship.
 Imeralda stepped into his sight shaking her head, “You men are crazy sometimes; you actually look pleased!
 If your armor had not held you would be dead now.
 And it is not like you are fighting someone who deserves to die.
 Most of these men are honorable warriors.” Rodregas nodded.
 “True, hopefully another day of this though and we will be back to fighting those we should be fighting, and it will be far harder to stop me if I achieve a greater sigil.” Imeralda crouched down, she had a very serious expression on her face, and Rodregas had a sense that he was not going to like what she said next.
 “Rodregas,” she said slowly, “we are not doing this for vanity right?” Rodregas nodded, he sensed she knew the answer to the question but was going somewhere with the question.
 She looked around to make sure others in the arena could not overhear.
 “We attacked a slave caravan simply because there were children and innocents that needed rescuing though the odds were against us.” Rodregas nodded again.

"What's wrong with that?"

 He started to move, but I held onto him.
 "Alec, she'll probably be okay.

 Not tonight."
 It was like I could see the thoughts dart around as he put pieces together, and I was suddenly torn between telling him in the hopes it would buy Jasmin her last night with Ben, and trying to keep her secret.
 My heart raced until he finally relaxed and sank back down with me.
 "Please don't let on that you know.

Much of her magic was gone, but not all.
 Her hand brushed his, and a small shock of electricity crossed between them.
 The soldier instinctively pulled his hand back, giving Aurelia the opening she needed.
 She squirmed out from beneath, gripped her staff, and then whirled.
 The wood cracked against the back of his skull, knocking him against the wall just as hard.
 Blood splattered from his broken nose.
 “You’ll pay for—”
 The end of her staff dislodged two more of his teeth.
 The soldier panicked and turned to run, but found his feet entangled.

After a quick glance around, I slid the book back into my pack.
 I rolled over and fell asleep listening to Ruby’s quiet tune.
 The next morning, the group seemed in unusually high spirits.
 I had no idea why the mood had shifted, but I enjoyed the laughter and joking anyway.
 We rode past a waterfall, the roar of water making me curious.
 I figured Ruby was my best bet.
 Chevelle gave me no answers and though hers were sometimes cryptic, I knew she’d been reading books on magic.
 “Ruby, is there a way to harness the power of things… like that waterfall?” Grey glanced at me.
 The look of concern for my intelligence was not exactly uncommon, but it was something I could never quite get used to.

I found myself outside the school, sitting on the edge of the parking lot without a clear idea how I'd ended up there.
 There was a vaguely irritating noise behind me that didn't seem to fit with what I expected from school.
 I thought about turning to see what it was, but was thankfully too far back into the gauze to act on the thought.
 I went back to contemplating the pair of ants that were currently trekking across my right foot.
 "Adriana.
 Are you okay?"
 My insides were too raw.
 Just coming out long enough to listen to Mrs. Campbell had opened everything back up.
 My mind tried to shy away, to sink away from the certainty of more jagged shards being shoved into me, but this voice was an important one.

What bugged me the most was that Seth didn’t fight me when I pushed him down.
 He just sat on the ground not saying anything at all in his own defense.
 Now, I couldn’t find him anywhere and I would never get my answer.
 I heard a large snap to my right and I whirled around.
 I heard another crack and I slowly crept towards the noise.
 Another snap sounded, louder this time, to my left.
 I changed direction and hid behind a tree.
 I peeked around it.
 Seth grabbed another stick and slammed it into a tree.
 It hit the tree with a loud crack and broke in half.

He had suffered for years with a subtle kind of inner rot at letting the evil continue.
 In all the ways that mattered Rodregas knew he was no better than this man, he had spent most of his life as a slaver.
 Rodregas had no moral grounds on which to kill these men, but inside of him there was no mercy.
 He had crossed a line and could no longer live with the evil.
 Rodregas let go of the guard’s shield.
 He did not have the angle to grab his opponent’s throat.
 Instead he had to grab the man’s lower face which was exposed by the half helm, and then he squeezed.
 Rodregas felt the guard’s face give way to his rage and unnatural strength.
 For a moment the guard struggled to escape his hold, but Rodregas pulled him closer with one hand and with the other ripped his opponent’s face away.
 Rodregas felt a stab in his back as he took either an arrow or a sword.

Maybe the masters like Michelangelo and da Vinci had completed their greatest works with expressions very similar to what everyone else in the class was sporting.
 Still, I couldn't help envy such contentment.
 I dropped off my bundle of papers at Mrs. North's class, and started back towards my locker.
 I couldn't help trying to catch another glimpse of the art class as I walked past.
 I'd been hoping to see Alec again, but hadn't expected him to look up as I craned my neck to see inside.
 I stumbled a little in surprise.
 He was still gorgeous, but the simple joy was gone.
 He no longer looked like something that couldn't exist in this world, but even with anger etched on his features my heart still skipped a beat.
 I ducked around the corner and started down the stairs, my embarrassment at being caught staring giving way to anger.

I walked to the back window and stared out into the night.
 Moonlight glinted off Ruby’s figure in the distance, heading away from the village.
 I didn’t think.
 I just pulled a cloak from the pile on her bed and was out the hidden door behind the wardrobe.
 I ran in a crouch, praying no one spotted me as I gained on her.
 I only once glanced at the house in the fear I wouldn’t be able to find my way back.
 If I wanted to catch Ruby, I wouldn’t be able to mark my path.
 Her cloaked form leapt over a tall rock and disappeared.
 I hurried forward, sure I was about to lose both her and the route.
 When I topped the rock, I froze, taking a heartbeat too long to drop to my stomach.

The high-pitched scream of pain as Jasmin began trying to crush her opponent's spine was answered by rapidly-approaching howls.
 Vincent attacked with renewed strength at the promise of reinforcements.
 I was bleeding in a dozen places now, but the rage insulated me from pain and weakness.
 Both sides of my nature were united in hating Vincent.
 If I ever did manage to kill him, my questionable humanity wouldn't grieve.
 The world would be better for his absence.
 I could hear the other pack now, panting with exertion, our friends hot on their heels.
 Vincent overreached in his effort to claim the kill, and I sunk my teeth into the muscled flesh of his shoulder as I finally made it around behind him.
 My claws sank into his arms and legs as I repositioned to snap his neck, and then a hammer blow of weight struck me across the shoulders.
 Knocked loose from Vincent, I spun around in time to tear Simon from the air as he leaped at me again.

The elf did not reply as she vanished behind the trees.
 He stared after her for a bit, then turned toward home.
 Before he could take two steps, a sudden weight crashed into his side.
 He tumbled best he could, his shoulder absorbing much of the impact.
 His legs tucked underneath him and pushed, shooting him back to his feet.
 Out came his swords.
 Standing before him was Dieredon, his bow held in both hands like a staff.
 Long blades stretched out from either end, tiny razor teeth lining the front.
 The elf twirled the bow in his hands and then charged.
 Two quick hits batted one of Harruq’s swords out and away.

She purred.
 “Well, well.
 Alone, are we?” She smiled wickedly as she neared, coming uncomfortably close.
 “Let’s talk…” She leaned in further and something glistened in the air between us.
 I froze, unable to move away.
 “Stop.” Chevelle’s voice was sharp as the redhead was whisked away from me, laughing.
 Her curls brushed my face on their way past, taking my head on a dizzying spin.
 “Just having a little fun, Vattier,” she said.

“Rhys and Rider were saved by the wolves once.
 They think the animals understand.
 They follow the wolves, you see.
 That is why they are here.” We topped the ridge, jagged rock and loose dirt shifting beneath our feet, and Ruby dropped the quiver by the edge before climbing down with a deftness I had yet to master.
 Steed, Anvil, and Grey greeted us before we resumed training.
 I tried to keep my mind off the wolves, off the reason we were training, off the encounter with Chevelle, off all of the terrible things it kept returning to, and I was grateful for the fog that clouded my thoughts.
 Though I wasn’t exactly winning matches, I was getting better.
 The battering continued, and long days of constant fighting were making me tired.
 We took a break and I leaned back on a rock, staring at the sky as I rested.

My head was reeling from the spin as she smiled at me, waving her hands and bringing a plethora of bottles and canisters flying toward us to drop on the bed.
 I thought with disappointment that I hadn’t responded to her attack as Chevelle had taught me and laughed at the image in my head.
 Ruby gave me a genuine smile as she began twisting the lid on a small metal canister.
 “No mother to teach us the tricks of the trade,” she sighed as she leaned in.
 I jerked away from her, wanting to be angry about the comment.
 But Ruby had just told me her own story, no less tragic.
 She mistook my reaction.

For more than two centuries, war has been rationalized as an appropriate instrument in international affairs.
 The increasing destructiveness of violent conflict to society in general has resulted in a shift in military strategy from actual fighting to preventive diplomacy.
 The Helsinki Process, the Stockholm Document, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Warsaw Treaty’s adoption of the doctrine of ‘non-offensive defence’, and most recently the UN Secretary General’s Agenda for Peace – all give highest priority to war prevention.
 While welcome, these incremental measures do not fully recognize either the extent of the danger of the continued application of violence to achieve political ends or the extent of the opportunity which the end of the Cold War has brought for radically altering the way in which humanity settles domestic and international disputes.
 There was a time when war could be justified as a necessary expedient.
 Now the potential human and economic costs of even limited terrorist war – especially if it involves the use of nuclear or biological weapons, but even otherwise – are so great that the risks are no longer tolerable.
 Because the potential risks far outweigh the possible advantages of continued reliance on this means of achieving national and international security, war has become obsolete as an instrument of policy.
 At the same time, there is no longer an insurmountable political conflict within the UN system to prevent all member countries from agreeing to a total ban on the use of violence against each other.
 It is time for the UN to declare war itself a crime against humanity and to ban from membership any nation that engages in aggression against another.
 Even if this intention cannot immediately be made effective, the adoption of this Peace Imperative would mark a milestone in human affairs.

“You sure?” he asked.
 “You know that this means that Kojas was here, so he can’t be too far away.” “Don’t get your hopes up.
 I saw him once and I have no intention of being near him anytime soon.” He sat on the edge, the wind tossing around his hair.
 It was going to be seriously wind-blown later.
 I sat down next to him and I was trying to forget the dwarf’s mangled body.
 I shook and hugged myself.
 “Are you cold?” he asked, his voice full of concern.
 I just shrugged and squeezed my eyes shut.
 I saw Kojas’ glowing eyes and sword, the dwarf, his armies, the ghost girl, the dark woods and her haunting voice.
 It all crashed down on me, the weight of the whole situation.

 One day as we walked away from a beach after swimming, a police car pulled over and started to question us.
 They were big Hawaiian guys with badges and they did not like howlies.
 They grabbed us roughed us up and handcuffed us because we were two high white guys.
 They drove us deep into a sugar cane plantation.
 We were not going to the police station.
 Pete and I sat in the back of this police car on our bound hands in silence.
 They eventually pulled us out of the car and beat the shit out of us.
 They undid our handcuffs when they were done, emptied our pockets of every dollar, and even took the pot we had.
 They left us in the field and all we knew to do was to walk back the way we came.

Seth started to stand up and signaled me to wait for him.
 He jumped over and ran out into the open.
 He leaned forward and narrowed his eyes, probably trying to see the disappearing bunch.
 He held his hand out, signaling me to wait.
 Then he beckoned me and I stood up.
 Then someone tapped me on the shoulder.
 I bit back a scream and whipped out my knife.
 But I dropped it in surprise as I spotted Emily standing over me, rocking back and forth on her heels.

 Harruq snarled and shook his head.
 He shouldn’t have spoken to him.
 Shouldn’t have let him ask questions.
 The last of his adrenaline faded as images of the child’s quivering lips and trembling hands haunted his vision.
 “Half,” Harruq whispered as he wiped blood from his swords onto the grass.
 “Only half.”

You need to worry about getting better, and nothing else."
 My pout met with just as much success as it usually did.
 After a second or two I gave up and nodded.
 "Okay, I promise to be good and concentrate on getting better, if you'll come keep me company."
 The flash of emotion, barely visible in Alec's eyes, was a source of hope and despair all at once.
 Eagerness, desire.
 Both curbed by the same iron will that'd continued fighting long past where most people would've given up and died.
 I patted the bed next to me, wincing slightly as even that simple motion pulled on things that weren't meant to be pulled on.

I sighed.
 This was going to be like trapping a greased pixie.
 I sat for hours exploring the early texts, stories of the river clans and their battles with the Imps of Long Forgotten, firsthand accounts of the Trials of Istanna, and the long lineages of the eldest families.
 A whisper roused me from my studies and I realized it was late, so I decided to give up and start again the next day.
 Rising unsteadily, I heard the whisper again.
 But it wasn’t a whisper—it was the wind.
 I glanced backward.
 Paper fell to scatter on the floor.
 I surveyed the library, but it was practically empty.

Unbeknown to the Moon, the Earth had anticipated his great gesture of love, and sent forth a plague upon the land.
 As Adjam, the elder of the brothers, descended from the heavens and touched down upon the Earth, he collapsed to the ground in pain.
 Despite his agony as the very bones of his body rearranged themselves, he managed to call out a warning to Inock, to flee back to the Moon.
 The love of Inock for Adjam was so great that he rushed to his brother's side, where he too fell victim to the Earth's plague."
 I wanted so very badly to remain awake, but wrapped comfortably in the warmth of Alec's arms, I couldn't fight off exhaustion any longer, and I felt myself drift off into dreams of two brothers who survived the plague, rising from the ground after seven days, one a wolf, the other a jaguar.
 Chapter 24 I'd been awake for several minutes before I finally remembered where I was.
 I rolled over, opened my eyes, groaning when I saw that the other side of the bed was empty.
 Who knew what Alec thought.

I’m not comfortable, really, man, talking about my numinous side, as interesting as I think that is.
 I want to ask a lot of questions, without presuming there are always answers.
 Like, where do lares and penates, where does religion, fit in with this cynical lifestyle we’ve adopted, or that we’ve carefully constructed?
 As The Lovin’ Spoonful asked, “Do you believe in magic?” I mean, I don’t know what has caused me to cogitate about the underlying premise of life, you know?.
 I mean, fuck, are we really that far removed from our supranatural sides that any discussion or mention of it is inordinate, is worth commentary?
 Or are we only embarrassed by discussions of spirituality?
 If so, why?
 This interests me, I guess.
 When I told my shrink I didn’t use to be a spiritual person, his answer was, “You were not aware of being a spiritual person.”  I didn’t like his correction and insisted that, no, I embraced atheism briefly, then settled into a kind of solid-artifact agnosticism, i.e., I didn’t believe in anything I couldn’t put in my mouth and suck on.
 This is a line of thinking invented by my friend, Eddie, who named his belief system, Oralism.

At the invitation of the Soviet Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Commission's next meeting, in November 1990, was held in Moscow: it would examine the challenges facing the USSR during the shift to democracy and a civilian market economy, and identify steps to improve the food supply, speed military conversion and ease the economic transition.
 The immediate euphoria over the rapid reduction in tensions between East and West freed public attention to focus on other pressing problems and generated great expectations that a 'peace dividend' would usher in a period of rapid economic progress for developing countries.
 Yet, despite a remarkable one-third reduction in worldwide defence spending from peak levels in the 1980s, foreign aid budgets continued to shrink.
 This prompted us to examine the potential benefits that could be derived from transferring or redirecting scientific, technological, educational and productive resources from military applications to support development and the environment.
 At the same time, increasing pressure was mounted by donors on aid-dependent developing countries to reduce their own defence spending, often with out consideration for the genuine security concerns of these countries.
 The need to improve mechanisms to protect all nations from external aggression has stimulated a rethinking of the competitive security paradigm which has governed relations between nations throughout the century, and the formulation of an alternative approach.
 The slow expansion of world trade and economic growth in developing countries during this period, attributable to prolonged recession in industrialized nations and a drastic decline in demand from Eastern Europe, underlined the need for more effective and better-coordinated development strategies to address the problems of the world's one billion people who live in hunger and absolute poverty.
 Increasing the production and availability of food to meet the nutritional needs of a still rapidly expanding global population led us to propose steps to double food production in deficit regions.
 In many countries, the problem of hunger has less to do with insufficient food production than with distribution or entitlement.
 The poor lack remunerative employment opportunities to generate the purchasing power needed to obtain the minimum essential requirements of food.

Brandon took a deep breath.
 His voice was quiet now, the perfect example of someone admitting something they weren't proud of.
 "Things are complicated with Cassie.
 Our families go really far back, it's almost like she's my sister sometimes.
 She doesn't like to listen to me, and when she gets mad, things get very unpleasant."
 It was a weak explanation, but there was something in his voice that made me believe him.
 The few doubts I still had melted away as I finally met his eyes.
 I've always been pretty good at reading people, and I'd never seen anyone whose eyes conveyed that level of sincerity.

He snatched his swords and sheathed them.
 “I’ll make you pay for that.”
 After a bit of debate, he decided not to tell Qurrah.
 Velixar had already made it clear they needed to be careful.
 Now he understood why.
 He wouldn’t tell Aurelia, either.
 That would be stupid, and stupid he was not…‌most of the time.
 “I need a drink,” he said, turning toward the town and trudging back.

“I am Chevelle Vattier.” I nodded a slow, stuttering nod.
 He wasn’t smiling, his face unreadable.
 “I am an old friend of Junnie.
 I saw her at Council this morning.
 She was disappointed she has been too occupied by clan business of late to guide you.
 I offered to help her.
 To help you.” The stranger I had been obsessed with was going to help me with my studies.
 I melted, sliding down into my chair.
 He was still holding his hand out to me.
 My back pressed against the wall, and as he took a step forward I became wholly aware of how small and isolated the library space I had chosen was.

It felt like a wall of stones behind me.
 I didn’t look back, though, because just as I’d regained my footing, I heard the howls.
 Before the next breath, a new sound—a closer sound—filled my ears.
 Shoosh, shoosh, shoosh.
 It took longer than it should have to realize they were arrows.
 My mind couldn’t seem to process the scene fast enough.
 Before I could distinguish the threats, they were changing.
 The hands I’d splayed against the wall of stones for support were now in bonds.
 I forced myself to look away from Ruby’s back, her arms stretched out defensively, to see what was holding me.
 My breath came then, fierce and gasping.

My son produced a crumpled receipt and for a couple hundred dollars we reclaimed his dream camera.
 I thought this camera meant the world to him.
 The camera was apparently second and last to his need for drugs—duh— like everything else.
 I knew I couldn’t be the first parent who paid off the loan on a child’s prized belongings.
 I did know that it would remain my camera until he could pay back everything he owed and prove to me he was sober.
 It broke my heart that I was retrieving something from hock that we had given him as the perfect gift to inspire him, and that it had ended up helping fund his drug habit.
 It broke my heart that my Brandon was a drug addict.
 Agenda Item Three: Confront Brandon directly with an intervention.
 The family intervention included me, Bryce, Harry, Anabel, Lisa and even the arresting officer, Denny White, via phone.
 The intervention started with the assumption that Brandon was currently detoxing (for the second time) with us at home, and there were expectations everyone had of him.

They would come for me.
 There would be another inquisition.
 What had the Council member told Fannie?
 He must have known I was a witness, why else would he have been there?
 I could still see the anger on her face.
 She would accuse me, I was sure.
 Somehow, Evelyn would make this my fault.
 “Well?” Fannie hissed, leaning over to glare at me.
 I jerked back to reality, no idea what she’d been saying.
 “Where were you during the commotion?” she repeated.

She’s still a bit of an outcast though.” He was still talking as I struggled to catch up in my head.
 I interrupted him, unable to stop myself.
 “My mother died.” I had no idea why I was speaking.
 I batted my eyes and tried to shake it off, concentrating on Steed again.
 He seemed to notice I was back and continued his story.
 I leaned my head on his chest, snuggling into his warmth.
 My face felt numb.
 Somewhere in the distance, the door opened and the vibration in Steed’s chest quieted as his words cut off.
 My head turned dazedly toward the door, keeping it steady against Steed.
 Chevelle’s furious gaze flicked to my cloak piled on the floor before returning to us.

When she opened them, she was calmer.
 "I do love you, Rick, and I enjoy being here.
 But if I thought I could never go home--"   She shuddered.
 "When I'm missing my family, thinking about seeing them again and thinking how ecstatic they'll be is the only thing that keeps me from complete despair."
 She opened the hand clenching the diamond and held it out to him.
 "I'm sorry, Rick.
 I love you, but I can't marry you."
 Reluctantly he took the ring, pocketing it as he watched her rise and head for the bathroom.
 She didn't know what he did—that she could go home tomorrow.
 She'd calm down, and then things would go back to normal.

I wandered back to the front door and was surprised by a tall figure there.
 The elaborate robe and tassels of a decorated council member blocked my way and the fear returned.
 “Elfreda.” I cautiously dipped my head in respect.
 “Juniper Fountain has received the calling.” I stared at him in disbelief, stuttering out a, “Wha—” But then I caught myself, because I had heard clear enough.
 The more important question was, “When?” He grimaced at my disrespectful manner.

 Not long from now?

Buddy “Slipshod” Gardner, Memphis’ answer to Jerry Garcia, Memphis gift to the world, from integrity and precocity to sell-out.
 So much is lost now, so little written down, so little recorded.
 For those with the stamina to search it out, Black Lung made one album, released on the Pepper label, a little Memphis soul mixed in with their own acid-blues.
 It was called Turntable Poison.
 Some say it sounded like The Rascals crossed with Hot Tuna.
 One cut comes to mind, a piece they played in every set at The Shell, the ballad, “Mr.
 Handy and Hakel-Bärend.”  On the LP they insisted on the extended version with Buddy’s long, side-handed solos, slick as molten lead and the twelve minute drum solo by Skippy Quetzalcoatl, effectively killing the album’s potential sales but insuring the group a spot in infamy alongside the lost tapes of Mudboy and the Neutrons and the missing five hours of von Stroheim’s Greed.
 There was also the shorter, “Blues for Wendy Ward,” with its plaintive chorus, “Thank you for at least that sweet ache,” a phrase Buddy made sound like a supplication to the gods.
 “Wendy Ward” got some air play around the country, on the late night FM stations, a minor flickering fame which only whet Buddy’s appetite for more, for larger radio audiences, larger followings, more groupies, better food backstage.
 He wanted it all, Buddy did.

We were gliding high up in the eerie sky and the view was actually beautiful.
 The trees looked like an endless sea of lush green and the sun peeked out from behind the clouds.
 I felt the urge to hold my arms out like they do in those movies so I could feel the wind on my arms.
 It was already making my hair flap all over the place.
 I heard Seth huff out and I turned.
 He gave me a face and said, “Your hair keeps getting in my face.” I turned back around.
 “Deal.” We turned in the air and I could see the mountains in the distance.
 They were small but were growing fast as we neared them.
 I could feel the dragon’s muscles pump underneath my legs.

The avoidance of pain is a great way to teach someone to be nimble and quick.
 My war masters at the palace would say you two are too old to learn the staff, but it is the way that I know.” “Sir Paladin,” he said to Rodregas, imposing the unearned honor title.
 “I assume with your training from all your ex-knights that you know how to use the staff?” As Doi’van spoke he looked at how Rodregas was holding the staff.
 “Fight with a staff?” Rodregas responded in surprise.
 “No, can’t say that I ever have.
 The weapons of the Knight are the sword, the mace, the lance and the bow.
 Those are the weapons of a warrior,” he stated.
 “And what do you do when facing a warrior in full plate armor?” asked Doi’van.
 “Even chain mail can stop an arrow or the edge of a sword.
 And while a mace is great against chain, crushing your opponent and breaking their bones, such tactics take far too long against plate armor.” Rodregas was not sure what to say to that question.

She then led Rodregas and Doi’van to the figure of a woman.
 She was short and muscular and older than average for the tournament.
 Her bed was more exposed and Rodregas could feel the attention of one of the healers.
 He seemed to be afraid to come over even when the body started to shake in pain.
 After they stepped away from the female squire the healer came over to the other side of the bed from Rodregas and Doi’van and touched the woman’s neck.
 He looked reassured at her vital signs and said, “What did you do?” He looked nervous, though Rodregas was not sure why.
 Imeralda spoke up, “I hope you are not offended, but I am part Nymph and our healing powers work differently than yours.
 She should heal faster for the next few days.” Rodregas hid his smile; it was a good cover story.
 “Thank you,” said the healer.

I was still trying to sort out all the pieces when Brandon fished his cell phone out of a pocket and checked the time.
 In an amazing display of herd behavior, thirty seconds later his friends had all disappeared, and he was standing to leave.
 "We should do this more often.
 I'll see you tomorrow."
 The words were innocent enough, but there was something in his eyes that made a rush of warmth shoot through me.
 Britney was so excited she could hardly speak, but I was too excited myself to feel very superior.
 I floated through my next class, and would've gone through the rest of the day the same way, if I hadn't had to share a class with Alec.
 Still, I was so happy that even Alec's giving me the cold shoulder didn't completely sour my day.
 Rachel had turned my illness into something really cool, and Brandon really did like me.

She was beautiful and it shocked me that she had ever considered anything else and to the point that she tried to destroy herself.
 I couldn’t help but compare her in my mind to Ashley.
 A young man was next.
 He spoke with a Jersey tough guy accent, was animated as he addressed the room, and his posture was that of some hoodlum walking the streets.
 He wore a sleeveless white tank top (a wife beater) revealing tattoos covering both his arms and wrapping all the way up around his neck.
 It seemed like an unusual choice of clothing given the ceremony and the fact that our son had requested that we bring him a suit, but we were looking across such a diverse room that it actually did fit.
 He was warm and friendly and although his appearance shocked me at first, just as our first impression of this facility had, he too won me over.
 He had high praise for many of the staff and students and high hopes for what was once a dismal future when he was a drug dealer and an addict.
 He admitted that he had started his life as a gang member.
 His life of “gang banging” had led him to do unthinkable things to others and also lead him to a life filled with an abundance of drugs.

We moved into a three-bedroom home with my grandparents in Los Angeles, California.
 My Uncle Dan lived there also.
 My grandfather was a very volatile person, a hateful man, and he clashed with his son—my Uncle Dan—often.
 They physically fought, and my uncle was no match for his father.
 My grandfather, a retired oil driller from Oklahoma and Kansas, drank a lot.
 His skin was Indian-dark, and the wrinkles on his face were deep.
 My brother and I would hide when they fought, and my mother would hold us if she was there, placing her hands over our ears and cradling us close to her.
 Her body muffled the sounds.
 She would rock slightly while humming or singing quietly so we would drift off to anyplace but there.
 We stayed because we had no place else to go, just as my uncle and my grandmother did.

Once we got to school, I'd found the rampant gossip had subsided to a dull rumble, but the few undecided votes had come down solidly on the side of everyone else.
 Some people hated me for using Brandon, others hated me for playing Alec, while a small, but decidedly upwardly-mobile group disliked me for achieving not just one, but both of the conquests they'd been dreaming of since grade school.
 In the end, it didn't really matter why everyone disliked me.
 Still, only the fact that Alec's pack closed ranks around me kept the situation from becoming unbearable.
 Biology went better than it had since my first day in Sanctuary, largely because Alec seemed to have developed a postdoctorate knowledge of Biology.
 Also he didn't have a single qualm when it came to using that knowledge to deflect questions aimed at me.
 Mrs. Sorenson tried three different times to make me look stupid before finally giving up and getting down to the business of teaching.
 She continued to shoot us nasty looks throughout the class, but I hardly noticed.
 Alec spent the rest of the class time writing questions for me in the margins of my notebook.
 By the time I'd described my grandparents, kindergarten teacher, and top three most embarrassing moments, I wanted to get a chance to ask some questions of my own, but he just shook his head and passed me my notebook back with a new set of quickly-jotted queries.

During 1993, 42 countries were involved in 52 major conflicts, and another 37 experienced political violence.
 Terrorist warfare, whose principal aim is to threaten social peace, has become the model for conflicts in Northern Ireland, the Middle East and the drug war in Colombia.
 Modern means of communication, increased vulnerabilities of inter-dependent, integrated civil societies, and modern instruments of violence make these forms of war extremely destructive.
 The expansion of war to encompass society poses one of the most serious challenges to national and international security and development and raises fundamental questions regarding war as an instrument of policy.
 For more than two centuries, war has been rationalized as an appropriate instrument in international affairs.
 The increasing destructiveness of violent conflict to society in general has resulted in a shift in military strategy from actual fighting to preventive diplomacy.
 The Helsinki Process, the Stockholm Document, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Warsaw Treaty’s adoption of the doctrine of ‘non-offensive defence’, and most recently the UN Secretary General’s Agenda for Peace – all give highest priority to war prevention.
 While welcome, these incremental measures do not fully recognize either the extent of the danger of the continued application of violence to achieve political ends or the extent of the opportunity which the end of the Cold War has brought for radically altering the way in which humanity settles domestic and international disputes.
 There was a time when war could be justified as a necessary expedient.
 Now the potential human and economic costs of even limited terrorist war – especially if it involves the use of nuclear or biological weapons, but even otherwise – are so great that the risks are no longer tolerable.

 Iraq has effectively pre-92mempt0m preventive planning for war in92m Afghanistan0m and Libya.92m Consequently0m, Western policy has stacked the Iraq and sanctions the attacks in92m Libya0m, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.

One of the greatest barriers to solving the world’s employment problem is the perception that trade destroys jobs.
 As in the case of technology, the interactions are complex and must be viewed in their entirety, rather than in isolated industries.
 The global economy is not a zero sum game in which increased production by one country must necessarily result in reduced production by another.
 Trade opens up new opportunities.
 It permits each country to specialize in industries where it possesses a ‘comparative advantage’.
 This specialization enables it to evolve improved processes to achieve higher levels of quality and productivity, larger production volumes and lower costs.
 This results in higher incomes for its workers and makes their products more affordable in other countries, which in turn raises standards of living abroad.
 The resultant rise in real incomes domestically and overseas stimulates demand for more of these products as well as for other products that can be produced locally or imported from overseas.
 Trade also tends to raise the quality of jobs in an economy.
 It forces higher-wage countries and their workers to specialize in technology-intensive and skill-intensive occupations that pay higher wages.

ons about technology and jobs have been making sense since the market for highly skilled fields now remains the lowest in92m the0m world. New technology fields92m all0m pay92m higher0m wages than92m traditional0m higher-wage kinds or lower-wage kinds.

We played larger and larger gigs.
 We got a reputation.
 I started writing songs at an astonishing clip, words and chords and melodies colliding in me like some kind of atomic reaction.
 And we started hanging out with the Mudboy guys, with Alex Chilton, the whole scene.
 Memphis hasn’t been given enough credit for its 60s influence, man, you know.
 I mean, the soul stuff, yeah, Sun and Stax.
 Great, great things there, but there was also this underground thing going on.
 With Mudboy and The Neutrons and Alex and The Manor and The Bitter Lemon.

Picnics had swapped off with treasure hunts and then been replaced by other activities depending on Dad's mood and my age.
 My subconscious had keyed in on the one scene guaranteed to make me feel miserable.
 "Was that close to your house in Minnesota?
 I..." Whatever else Alec was saying was lost to the roar in my ears, caused as always by my racing heart.
 I didn't even have a chance to try and fight the attack.
 By the time I realized I was in trouble, papers were flying off my desk and the floor was racing up to meet me.
 Rather than swimming around in blackness like I normally did when collapsed, this time there was just nothing.
 One second I was falling, the next I was opening my eyes and looking up at Alec.

A flash of embarrassment hit as it dawned on me Chevelle must have placed me there; he must have seen my home, my room.
 And then I smiled, because he had left me a flame.
 I stretched my entire body, rejuvenated from the rest.
 I was unsure how long I’d slept but it looked like the sun was rising again and I wanted to be out of the house before I ran into Fannie.
 It was probably too early to hope to see Chevelle.
 I’d spent the last two days with him, but he hadn’t revealed anything of himself and that had only made me more curious.
 I retrieved the documents I’d hidden after my second trip to the library to find out whether they added anything to the report from the Council’s record-keeper.
 There wasn’t much new there, mostly more names, but I did notice a watermark on one of the pages.
 I held it up to the light to better see.

Achieving food security necessitates increasing food production and employment opportunities.
 Agriculture plays a dual role in the abolition of hunger – it produces the food and it can also produce a great many of the jobs needed by households to buy food in developing countries.
 Since agriculture is the world’s single largest employer, raising production and productivity in this sector can immediately place additional purchasing power in the hands of the rural poor, who will in turn utilize the additional income for purchasing more food, clothing and other basic consumer goods that will create more jobs and higher incomes for countless others.
 The increased agricultural produce becomes raw material for a wide range of agro-based industries and services that stimulate formation of new enterprises, and create downstream jobs as well as products for further processing, domestic sale or export.
 This is the rationale behind the Prosperity 2000 strategy for India, which forms a viable model for many other countries to emulate.
 Promoting job creation in agriculture appears at first glance to contradict the global trend of the past hundred years, in which employment in this sector has declined steadily from historic highs of more than 70 per cent in the industrial nations to the point where, today, only 2 per cent of the workforce in the UK, 3 per cent in the USA and 4 per cent in Germany are directly engaged in farm operations, although a much larger percentage of the workforce in these countries work in businesses and industries linked to agriculture.
 Nevertheless, this strategy follows a natural course of development that has occurred in many countries which now have a relatively small portion of their workforce in agriculture.
 Agricultural surpluses and rising farm incomes are preconditions and stimuli to economic growth and industrialization.
 For most developing countries with the vast majority of people still residing in rural areas, the most cost-effective and practical strategy to generate more jobs and raise personal incomes is through agriculture.
 Today, more than 1.1 billion people in developing countries, constituting 58 per cent of the economically active population, work in agriculture.

“Damn, Rodregas thought” he had said “please.” Master Ravenhurr ordered something done; he did not say “please” to his guard captain.
 As Rodregas stood, Captain Poir held the robe open and he clumsily put it on.
 His movements were awkward in this new larger body.
 His angle was wrong, Rodregas felt like he was standing on a crate.
 “Should I order the birthday celebration milord?” asked the captain.
 The coming celebration had been the talk of speculation for months as well as the object of more than a little betting among the guards.
 Rodregas nodded, his thoughts swirling as he realized that he could use the celebration to his benefit.
 Without looking at the captain he walked toward the stairway, and the captain followed close behind him.
 At the door Rodregas took a deep breath and said, “Captain, that ceremony did not go smoothly, but the gods once again proved to favor me, and I wish to be generous with the birthday ceremony.

 How could it be that a man she’d known only a week wanted to be with her all the time when she’d gone four or five days at a time without seeing the man to whom she was betrothed?
 Could it be that Davis’ job was harder than Rick’s?
 No—it wasn’t just that Rick didn’t spend half the evening at his office.
 He’d even chosen to be with her rather than with a girl he’d known longer than he had her, a girl from his own decade.
 Confusing thoughts and feelings kept her from being able to fall asleep quickly that night.
 She'd had so much fun this week, watching pictures and using the microwave oven and wearing blue jeans, but she missed her parents and her brother and Tom and Davis.

I might have run back to the village right then, but they would never release me.

 I glanced down the mountainside.
 I couldn’t have found my way back if I’d wanted to.

 I stared at my palms, some spell-bought map carved into my skin, and was hit full force with the knowledge that I didn’t even know where I was going.
 I was about as low on options as I could get.
 If not for Chevelle’s desire to skip out on Council business for a few days, or whatever we were doing here, I’d already be imprisoned.

I let my gaze drop, and found an unearthly pool of liquid light at my feet.
 The quiet murmur of falling water to my right kindled a burning thirst I hadn't realized I'd been feeling since I opened my eyes.
 Looking towards the waterfall, I found a shimmering ribbon of light working its way down the rock face.
 The sight was so incredibly beautiful it took me several moments to realize the tendril was the waterfall I'd been looking for.
 I reached into the dancing pool of light at my feet and smiled as my cupped hands came away filled with water that lit up my palms.
 I couldn't imagine anything more surreal.
 I might have stayed there for hours if the barest whisper of sound hadn't distracted me.
 Alec was staring at me, an expression of disapproval marring otherwise perfect features.
 "Of all the places for you to intrude, why did it have to be here?"

The class passed in a blur as I made a half-hearted attempt to focus on the questions and remember all kinds of facts about photosynthesis that I'd known just a few days before.
 It was useless.
 The separate pieces of information skittered about on the edge of my memory without ever becoming tangible enough to relate to the answer I needed.
 By the time class ended, I'd almost completely shut down.
 I registered the whispers as I made my way to English.
 I normally would've been mad, or possibly embarrassed, but it was like my feelings were wrapped in layers of cotton candy.
 If I really pushed, I could faintly feel the hard edges, but there were so many layers shrouding them.

Beyond the shanties, across the river and the road, a building invaded the sky.

Already Russia’s cocoa imports have risen to four times the level in 1991.
 The gap between the availability of food in industrial nations and in developing countries remains large.
 Food supplies per capita for all developing countries, measured in terms of total calories available, are only 72 per cent of the levels in the industrial countries.
 The availability of protein for consumption is 40 per cent lower in developing countries than in industrial nations.
 Viewed from another perspective, this gap represents a huge potential for the growth of agriculture, and through it for more rapid industrialization and job creation in developing countries, with rising exports from industrial nations.
 Rising incomes are accompanied by a diversification in diet which generates greater demand for wheat, meat and dairy products, fish, vegetables, fruits and processed foods.
 Projections for the year 2010 anticipate a 60 per cent increase in cereal consumption in developing countries, a 52 per cent increase in meat consumption, and a 69 per cent increase in milk consumption.
 Meat consumption in China has tripled since 1978 and is expected to more than double again over the next two decades.
 Sugar consumption in developing countries is currently less than half the average of industrial nations.
 In India, sugar consumption is projected to rise from 13 kg to more than 25 kg, generating a demand for a 100 per cent increase in sugar cane production, the establishment of 300 to 400 new sugar mills in the country and the creation of 3 to 4 million new jobs in this industry alone.

 FOOD SECURITY IN AFRICA
 The present prognosis for Africa resembles the pessimistic assessment of Asia in the 1960s that projected most Asians would face starvation in the 1970s.
 Over the past two decades, total food production in Africa has grown at exactly the same rate as for the world as a whole, but high levels of population growth have resulted in declining availability of food per capita in many countries, particularly in the sub-Saharan region.
 This suggests that a grim outcome is not inevitable, if concerted action is taken now.
 Several factors have impeded achievement of higher agricultural growth rates in the region: political instability and civil unrest, poor macro-economic and agricultural policies, drought, and physical difficulties in farming in some areas.
 The ravages of war have had the most devastating effect, but inadequate and counter-productive policies have also had a major impact.
 Low mandated prices for agricultural products have acted as a disincentive to producers.
 State control of farm support systems, including marketing, transportation and input supply, is highly bureaucratic, inefficient, and, often, corrupt.
 Overvalued exchange rates encourage the import of low-priced farm products, depress local farm incomes, and make exports uncompetitive.

Above the right eye was a long gash, already scabbed over.
 I suspected a prowler had clubbed her and swiped her few items of jewelry.
 But she managed a goofy smile and mumbled that she must’ve fallen, and getting up had seemed too hard to bother with.
 An ambulance carted her away.
 At the hospital, a nurse tapped her spine.
 The lab found meningitis.
 The only doctor who would talk to me gave her lousy odds.
 When she rallied, they took her to an isolation ward, to sequester her for months.

Rodregas then said, “I agree we are just starting to figure out that there is something big going on.
 I can’t believe even the Immortalists would be crazy enough to go up against both the Celestial Gods and the Daemon Lordsof the Infernal though.” Imeralda nodded and said, “What price is so high as to be even better than God hood?” The three sat silent for a few minutes soaking in that question.
 Rodregas looked at Imeralda and asked, “Well, we can’t answer that today, but how did you break Van’dret’s spell?” Imeralda nodded and with a smile said, “I always hoped that if I had to take on a sorcerer it would be in the Forest where I would have an edge, but no, it had to be in a hallway!
 I knew my regular spells; he would counter without a problem.
 So I had to work around the spell.
 The spell was one to hold you from walking or running.
 I actually tried to dance or hop,” she said with a smile.
 “But he was too good, he had those covered.
 But, I have been practicing a spell to float in the air, and that worked.
 The spell was not designed to stop someone from floating in place.

They would push anyone falling out back into the squares.
 Watchers were not allowed around the squares.
 Rodregas knew Imeralda and Doi’van were atop the wall, the closest spot allowed for spectators.
 Two contestants had already fought.
 The rules were simple.
 Two went in and one came out walking.
 The constants were bare of chest and foot.
 There were no fancy speeches to start the match, a bell sounded and the next round began.
 Rodregas kept his weight low and his hands up.
 Doi’van and he had discussed the best approach.

You were superimposing what you see over top of what someone like me would see.
 Only how would you know what things look like to us?"
 Alec's chuckle held more than a little resignation in its timbre.
 "You are amazing.
 Anyone else waking up in a strange place would've run away as soon as they regained consciousness.
 At the very least, you should have started screaming.
 Instead you wander around, take in some rather feeble attempts at art, and then sneak out without saying a word."
 Secure in the knowledge he could see me, I stuck my tongue out at him.

“She is correct; most have trained war horses and a few are Dire Steeds.
 I will be honest Rodregas, I am not sure that this will work.
 These warriors are trained in the use of the lance and their war horses will negate your personal advantage in physical might, as your horse is a trail mount.” Doi’van paused and said, “But, the real problem is that you are without plate armor.
 I am not sure how you can survive such a competition.
 The competition with mace or hammer will be only marginally better for you.
 Your body is far stronger than theirs, but not as strong as Night Bronze or Mithril.” Doi’van shook his head.
 “I don’t know how you can compete with simple steel!” “Rodregas,” Doi’van said, “I think you should give up on this task, the Cathedral is busy; and none will know if we simply leave.” Imeralda nodded, but something about the way she stood told Rodregas that she knew he would not do this.
 “So have you done the math?” Rodregas asked.
 “What if I get five points on the hand-to-hand and five with the sword and shield and maybe two with the bow?
 Would twelve points get me to the final?” “Unlikely,” answered Doi’van.

“Whatever, you’re now an official maniac.” I pulled out my hunting knife.
 “Maniacs get destroyed by me.
 No maniacs are allowed to exist except for me and Emily.” He jumped off as I stabbed the one on my arm.
 I grabbed my bow and shot him with an arrow before he his little legs could he him very far.
 He fell to the ground, the arrow sticking straight up at the sky.
 Now the forest was maniac free.
 I killed the others and looked up to find the thrashers dead too, probably courtesy of Seth.
 A few dwarfs were also lying dead in front of Emily.
 I walked back to my body and closed my eyes.

Power rippled in the air, black and deadly.
 As the elf fought against the shadow wall Velixar began another spell.
 Words of magic flew off his tongue in perfect pitch and pronunciation in spite of their incredible difficulty.
 A strong thrust from Dieredon finally shattered the invisible barrier but the explosion of power sent him flying backward.
 He rolled when he hit the ground, his legs tucked, and then with a kick he vaulted himself into the air.
 He landed on his feet and lunged at the necromancer, the blades of his bow leading.
 “Be gone!” Velixar roared, the sound of a daemon unleashed.
 Dieredon fought, but it felt as if a thousand hands pulled him back.
 Pain spiked within his chest, and a sick sound filled his head as two of his ribs broke.
 A harrowing gasp escaped his lips.

If you were mine, I would want to spend every minute of every day with you, and I'd want to hold you every chance I got.

 "I'm sorry," he told her.
 "I didn't mean to get so excited.
 I just really care about you, and I don't want you to mistake infatuation for love and end up hurt."
 They finished their yogurt in silence.
 Rick threw their napkins away, and they began wandering toward the mall exit.
 "I'm sorry, Marie," he repeated.
 "It's really none of my business."
 She was quiet for a few moments.

Inside was a stash of healing potions.
 All he needed was one and he could fight again.
 Just one.
 As he reached to open a drawer he felt his leg jerk back, halting his momentum.
 He crashed to the floor, screaming in pain as one of his forearms landed hard.
 Then he felt his ankle start to burn.
 “Take him, brother,” Qurrah said, his whip wrapped around Ahrqur’s left foot.
 Harruq did not bother to cross the distance.

How could she have acted that way?
 Rick set the pizza on the table and picked up some change to go get them some Cokes.
 He knew Marie would be embarrassed.
 Women of 1927 weren't supposed to be so forward with a man, even if they weren't, as she was, engaged to another.
 But her kiss and the way she'd touched him made him think that maybe he could win her love.
 Maybe he could convince her to stay in 2011 with him.
 He returned to the room with the Cokes and opened the box.
 "Mmm—it smells great."
 He put a slice on a plate and handed it to her.
 "Thank you," she mumbled, not looking at him.

Her parents were out, so she and Davis would be alone.
 Normally, she wouldn't dare be alone at home with a man--her father would be furious.
 But he trusted Davis with her.

"Because we have a better chance to get to know each other."
 He took her hand, kissing the back of her fingers.
 "This week we've exercised, done laundry, shopped, gone to the beach, cooked, watched TV, and talked the whole time.
 Well, except when we were watching TV, and even then your questions helped me to get to know you."
 She laid her head on his shoulder, pleased but confused.
 Rick was so different from Davis.
 She wished that she could talk about him with her mother.
 But when she could again talk with her mother, there'd be no point.
 Rick would be gone.
 That thought brought tears to her eyes, and she snuggled closer to him, wishing she could have everyone she cared about in the same decade.

“Right now we have to move!” We dashed up the hill in the direction the monsters were going.
 When we reached the top, Seth stopped and stared down.
 Emily and Jason looked confused but joined us.
 We looked down at the ground and I gasped as I saw all the monsters gather around in a semi-circle, waiting.
 “What are they waiting for?” Emily asked in a hushed voice.
 Seth squinted down.
 “I don’t want to know.” “Do you think it could…?” I asked.
 “Let’s hope not,” Seth interrupted me.
 Oh course; being ourselves, we don’t have any luck at all.

She gave him two quick raps across the chest.
 “Two to zero,” she said before dancing away.
 Harruq raised his swords and roared.
 He crossed the distance between them in a heartbeat, twice as fast as he had ever moved in their previous sparring matches.
 Aurelia leapt backward as blades dove for her chest and abdomen.
 Her staff shot spun back and forth to parry thrust after thrust.
 Harruq pressed his attack, shifting on one foot so that his next two attacks came slashing downward for her thigh and ankle.
 The staff blocked one but the other banged against her calf.
 “One to two,” Harruq said.

Rachel would always just get mad and say there was no excuse for how Jess was acting.
 Dominic always refused to say anything other than that Jessica had been through her own set of struggles, and had her reasons for her behavior.
 "I'll be done with Dom in just a moment, Jess, then I'll fix your hair while Rachel finishes up with Adri."
 The nickname should have hurt, but somehow it wasn't as bad when the pack used it.
 It was almost like having a new family, one without all of the grief-poisoned memories that popped up every time I really thought about Dad or Cindi.
 Faster than I would've believed possible, we were all in our dresses, and waiting in the living room for the boys to make their appearance.
 Jasmin and Rachel had worked what I was pretty sure was actual magic.
 Even Jessica was nothing less than stunning, and I didn't look as bad as normal.
 Jasmin's backless black dress and shoulder-length gloves had streaks of blue that brought out her eyes, while Dominic's tight, red gown seemed to give her the confidence and poise you'd expect from someone so gorgeous and utterly exotic.
 Jess had opted for a sleeveless silver number that flared out at the bottom so much I wasn't sure how Isaac would be able to walk next to her without stepping on the shimmery material.

Running Dog, Peabody and Sherman—that’s a funny story, really.
 They started at Peabody School, so that’s where the Peabody comes in, and the lead singer’s name was really Sherman.

 Most people say they don't have a choice rather flippantly, but he seemed rather more like he had his back against the wall than I expected.
 "You know, I presume, that there was some confusion regarding the tourism project she bid out for the city?
 Well, I've managed to get to the bottom of the situation and it appears we did indeed award the contract to her."
 The news seemed too good to be true.
 "You mean she's got the job?"
 "Technically it isn't an employment offer.
 It's more in the way of a consulting project, but yes, she'll be in a sense working for the city.
 I've asked my staff to make sure that the confusion is cleared up with the bank as well so you shouldn't be in any kind of danger of losing your house anymore."

It wasn't until I'd filed out into the grand foyer, eager to spend a few minutes taking in the gorgeous bronze statues liberally scattered throughout the room, that I realized why I felt so odd.
 Part of the difference was the normal sensation of having vicariously been part of something larger than life.
 My head knew all I'd done was sit motionless while performers portrayed a fictional story.
 The rest of me felt as though I had just risked life and limb, seen people I loved killed, and played a small but tangible part in altering the course of history.
 Returning to my mundane, ever so boring life was an incredible letdown, but that didn't explain the hollow sensation that'd lodged itself somewhere between my heart and stomach.
 Illogical as it sounded, the only explanation for feeling as though a part of me had been ripped out and lost was Alec's having disappeared sometime between the last note and the final bow.
 It was unsettling.
 Even my growing feelings for Brandon didn't hint at that kind of need.
 It was a pale shadow of what it felt like to lose a family member, but it was made up of too many of the same elements.
 One of the chaperons, an over-bleached woman who looked like she was struggling to deny her last eight or nine birthdays, had to call my name at least twice to shake me out of my funk.

I remembered being trapped underwater just before waking, but I hadn’t been drowning.
 It wasn’t a dream.
 I was horrified as more of the memory returned.
 The cloaks who had surrounded my mother, killed her, had been circling me.
 I knew they’d intended to destroy me, too, though I couldn’t see why.
 Chevelle had held me, pulled me into the water.
 He had tried to keep them from finding me as they attacked, tried to keep me from calling out to her.
 The look of fear, the look of sympathy.
 He’d held me back to save me.

We formed Black Lung around this time, with Dickinson’s help—the godfather really of Memphis Music, an angel, if you wanna know the truth—and with Sid Selvidge’s.
 We were doing covers mostly, blues stuff, the kind of thing Cream started with, Canned Heat, Graham Bond.
 Some pop.
 We did Boyce and Hart stuff, “She’s Not There,” “Locomotion.” “Roadrunner”  Hell, everyone did “Roadrunner.”  At least we never covered “Hey Joe.” I’d say Hendrix and The Leaves version of that chestnut are enough---yet there are, what, twenty or fifty or so versions.
 Anyway.
 We started to gel quickly, like within months.
 We were good, given the times, the distractions, the limitations.
 We were pretty good right away.

Rodregas half ran and half jumped to the next circle, where Ravenhurr stood with raised arms.
 Ravenhurr was focused on his inner magic and was not prepared for his own guards’ sudden action.
 Rodregas grabbed Ravenhurr’s arm and his belt, and using his weight and momentum against Ravenhurr, threw him bodily into the circle of colorful crystals where the half AElf maiden had stood moments ago.
 Ravenhurr, in an amazing act of balance, almost caught himself.
 He seemed to defy gravity as he hung in the air.
 Rodregas tried to reach out to push Ravenhurr into the circle, but before his hand touched the sorcerer, Ravenhurr lost his balance and fell into the circle.
 The moment that Ravenhurr crossed into the circle he started to burn.
 His body twisted in pain as he burned the same blue fire of creation that he had called forth to rip apart a man’s soul and steal the physical essence of a Celestial Lion.
 The flames that he had called forth to steal the AElfin maiden’s magical abilities now burned him.

His eyes were normal golden cat eyes, not the glowing red of most of the other creatures.
 The only daemonic aspect to the shape was a pair of horns coming out the sides of his head, not that dissimilar to Doi’van’s curving up and back protecting the skull.
 Only the tips were different; while Doi’van’s curved up, these curled down at the end.
 While Doi’van had seen a lion’s head on another man-like shape in the distance, and of course Doi’van’s dragon had a lion’s head, he felt drawn to this shape.
 While he was not as attracted as he had felt with the Celestial Lion, he guessed that this was as good a match as he would find among the Infernal Daemons.
 Rodregas looked back toward Doi’van, but could no longer see him.
 He knew he should check on him and Imeralda, but he also knew that they had all chosen to walk this path.
 It had ended up being a more interesting path than expected, but they all wanted to see where it went.
 He reached up and petted the powerful black head of the creature.
 Its ears had the only hint of non-black on the beast, a slight touch of silver.

Jasmin sprang at her opponent, catching her behind the shoulders as Vincent reeled away from me in a shower of blood.
 I'd finally managed a deeper strike on his arm.
 The high-pitched scream of pain as Jasmin began trying to crush her opponent's spine was answered by rapidly-approaching howls.
 Vincent attacked with renewed strength at the promise of reinforcements.
 I was bleeding in a dozen places now, but the rage insulated me from pain and weakness.
 Both sides of my nature were united in hating Vincent.
 If I ever did manage to kill him, my questionable humanity wouldn't grieve.
 The world would be better for his absence.

I could hear a plane start up in the background by the time she finally responded.
 "Okay, honey.
 If you're sure, then we'll do it, but if anything comes up just call me.
 I'll keep my cell phone with me all the time, and I made them promise to fly me back no questions asked if it became necessary."
 I stifled a laugh at the idea of Mom making a twelve-hour flight back to the US because I stubbed my toe, and instead tried to interject even more sincerity into my voice.
 "I'll be fine, Mom.
 I even promise to stay out of trouble.
 Have a safe flight."
 I stared at the cell phone for several seconds before looking up at Alec, who was just putting a cell phone that could have been the twin to the one I was holding away.

There I remembered the night my mom checked into the hospital and the doctor said she was probably a goner.
 “He’ll make it,” I said with defiance.
 “He’s Superman.” She nodded.
 “Let's keep hoping.
 Billy and Cliff should be on their way here, I sent a pass for them."
 The others in the car hadn’t gotten scratched, she said, and waited for an assurance that I wouldn't collapse or fly into a rage.
 I asked her if I could go meet Billy and Cliff.
 Knowing which way they would walk to the office from their auto shop class, around behind the football field, I took that route.
 The teacher was engaged with a carburetor and didn’t notice me trespassing in his class.
 I found Billy and Cliff wearing goggles, huddled over the head to a Chevy, grinding the valves.

The dragon righted itself and I scrambled back into sitting position.
 We were gliding high up in the eerie sky and the view was actually beautiful.
 The trees looked like an endless sea of lush green and the sun peeked out from behind the clouds.
 I felt the urge to hold my arms out like they do in those movies so I could feel the wind on my arms.
 It was already making my hair flap all over the place.
 I heard Seth huff out and I turned.
 He gave me a face and said, “Your hair keeps getting in my face.” I turned back around.
 “Deal.” We turned in the air and I could see the mountains in the distance.
 They were small but were growing fast as we neared them.
 I could feel the dragon’s muscles pump underneath my legs.

Rodregas then stepped forward, he had to be careful though, he was a good foot taller than his opponent.
 The guard’s long sword gave him better reach.
 Rodregas swung at him and retreated.
 The two shared several blows.
 The third time that he retreated after taking a blow, the guard went for the kill.
 The guard extended his whole body out in a lunge, thrusting his long sword out to its full length.
 The guard saw Rodregas’ braided leather armor and steel sword and thrust with the point.
 The lunge was perfect, the guard went for dead center, and even though Rodregas had been waiting for a similar move, the thrust almost caught him off guard.
 The guard had only one problem, one that he could not have anticipated.
 Rodregas had been taking easy swings, not revealing his true speed.

I found myself with existential nausea, the kind you wake up with in the morning and it’s all over you like an animal and there’s nowhere to go because the beast is you.
 I often backed myself into a corner and curled there like a fetus, as if covering my balls and stomach were protection, as if I feared some attack of a physical nature.
 This is what the fear does to you.
 It’s totally debilitating, man.
 Nausea can unseat you, can defeat the strongest man.
 And it’s a nausea that is in your blood—your whole body is sick.
 And, you know, looking at it now, I think I was sick like the country was sick.
 I was nauseated for the USA, you dig?

Maybe I can start a club at school."
 It was like someone else was doing the talking for me.
 I'd never been this bold, and to do so now with someone who could arrange for my mom's job to disappear again seemed like the worst kind of stupidity, but I couldn't fall apart now.
 I almost couldn't believe my eyes when his face turned red.
 "Listen here, Missy.
 I've been in politics longer than you've been alive, and it takes a whole hell of a lot more than a precocious teenager to blackmail me.
 So, you can just drop your veiled threats and pretend like we never had this conversation, or I will see that your mom is once again unemployed, and we'll just see whether or not your protector is bluffing."
 Stepping out of my front door and being hit by a cement truck would have been less of a surprise.
 I'd thought something odd was happening, but the idea of someone protecting us was almost unbelievable.
 The mayor took my shock as a sign he once again had the upper hand.

 His smile was surprisingly bashful.
 "I don't think you can go that far, but I try to anticipate most eventualities."
 The smile disappeared, and his face seemed to put on additional years.

 The body of Ahrqur Tun’del lay atop several strange markings and shapes drawn in the dirt.
 He remained wrapped in the blankets and sheets the two half-orcs had used to smuggle him out of his house.
 The wrappings provided a bit of relief against the growing smell of death that already permeated their home.
 “His spirit will be bound to mine,” Qurrah said, sitting on his knees before the body.
 His eyes were closed and his hands atop Ahrqur’s head.
 “Any question you or I ask he must answer truthfully.

Ending the spell left him totally disoriented.
 His sight returned to normal, and it felt a little like falling from a very tall tree.
 As he retched on his knees, he looked about, discerning his location.
 He was beside the building the two elves were in, directly underneath their windows.
 He could see the tips of their arrows sticking out, glinting in torchlight.
 Two adjacent homes were already ablaze, their occupants still inside.
 Qurrah turned and grabbed the frame of the door.
 “Burn!” he shouted, loud enough for the elves to hear.
 The wood blackened, smoke billowed from his hands, and then the entire building erupted as if bathed in oil.
 Qurrah laughed, untouched by the heat.

My father’s face was indescribable, his fury almost tangible.
 I couldn’t bring myself to look away from him, but I saw Rune standing in my peripheral vision.
 I was caught.
 I frantically searched for some explanation.
 But he didn’t speak.
 He flipped his arm, dismissing me.
 The tension showed in that small movement and I blanched.
 I started to pull away from the guard but he didn’t release me.
 I realized then I hadn’t been dismissed.
 It had been a direction for the guard.

It didn’t matter.
 Her expression made it clear she considered herself forgiven.
 She turned, facing the direction Chevelle had gone, and left me to my discoveries.
 I expected fury from my father.
 He never failed to disappoint me.
 He saw the child, as he called her, as an opportunity.
 I shouldn’t have been surprised.
 After all, had he not stolen my mother for precisely the same purpose, experimenting with power?
 He did, however, concern himself with where I’d found a human.

But I couldn’t feel anything aside from the pain in my mind.
 I focused all of my energy on finding some feeling somewhere and finally, though the terror was unrelenting, I felt my body again, knew it was there.

 Something had caught me.
 Not the ground, not a rock.
 Someone was carrying me.
 The horror must have stretched time, making the few seconds seem like minutes.

The news seemed too good to be true.
 "You mean she's got the job?"
 "Technically it isn't an employment offer.
 It's more in the way of a consulting project, but yes, she'll be in a sense working for the city.
 I've asked my staff to make sure that the confusion is cleared up with the bank as well so you shouldn't be in any kind of danger of losing your house anymore."
 I almost clapped for joy, only there was something off about it all.
 Since when did the mayor personally come to deliver a piece of relatively insignificant news?
 Not only that, why would he be so shaken up?
 He'd actually seemed to be trying to determine whether or not it would be okay to just leave a message.
 Like he was operating by a set of rules he didn't completely understand.

The thought of what was coming filled me with dread, but I shook my head.
 As scary as all of this was, I knew flying away and never knowing what'd happened would be worse.
 Alec was probably going to die, and all of the rest of us with him, but if he didn't, if the pack somehow managed to survive the coming crisis, I wanted to be there.
 Alec was more than capable of sending me away and then never letting me know he'd survived.
 There was a constant war inside him over what to do with me and I couldn't afford to give up my one advantage.
 He seemed less able to contemplate cutting me out of his life when I was around.
 I planned on playing that card for all it was worth.
 I was staying and that was it.
 Alec sighed, presumably in resignation, and then suddenly my legs were thrown up in front of me as he picked me up with inhuman speed.
 Only the steady pressure of Alec's arm around my waist kept me from screaming, and then I was back on my feet, and being carefully, but firmly shoved through a tangled knot of bodies.

The main thing was to get the money for the drugs.
 Then I was shown the contents of a small white plastic bottle: One hundred Oxys poured into the officer’s hand.
 They were smaller than I thought they would be and an odd green color.
 He gathered the pills back into the bottle and handed them to me, telling me to put them in an easily accessible jacket pocket.
 The officers were all gathered around, but my focus was now entirely on the lead man, Officer White, the same undercover officer who had busted my son, had screwed up by giving Brandon the wrong phone number and with whom I had negotiated this deal.
 He was cocky and his ego always front and center, but I completely understood this demeanor.
 A person who does this for a living should have a high level of confidence, and that translates into what one might call “a strong personality.” I was listening as if my life depended on these men.
 It did.
 I was told that I would also be arrested in a mock arrest so that the dealers would think we were all busted.

As Rodregas made his way down to the next level, the personal level of Master Ravenhurr, he closed the door to his suite of rooms that covered the whole floor.
 He listened as the other guards made their way down the tower.
 He leaned against the wall and took a deep breath.
 That had been close.
 Rodregas was shocked he had gotten away with it, especially after he had commanded the release of the remaining prisoners.
 He had been twice as generous as he thought Ravenhurr would have been, and Ravenhurr was too practical a man to release the prisoners as part of his celebration.
 The only prisoners in the keep’s dungeon were beings that were held for potential use in the ceremony.
 That meant they were of great power or talent.
 The prisoners were too dangerous to release, after Ravenhurr had so pissed them off by their imprisonment.
 But people did not question the order of the sorcerer and master of Raven Keep, so it should work.

From the feel of its balance, it was not a real fighting weapon, but only a simple utility knife.
 Rather than try to use the unfamiliar weapon that was slick with his blood, he threw it into the dark.
 Quickly Rodregas remembered he was in a fight for his life.
 He backed up from his confused opponents and gave himself more space.
 It was the middle of the night and there was only a sliver of moon, but he could still make out the forms of his attackers; there were four of them.
 No, a fifth stood away from the others and watched.
 The one who had stabbed him had the most aggressive posture: he looked tall and strong; Rodregas knew he had to take him out quickly so he moved in hard.
 None of the attackers seemed to be wearing armor nor did they have any weapons, other than the largest man, who held what looked to be a garden rake.
 Rodregas charged, bulling his way into the lead attacker and knocking him down.
 The assailant fell, being surprised by Rodregas’ actions.

"So I just go about my day like normal, pretending like I don't know Brandon's a psychopath who just happens to be able to change shapes at will and rip big holes in brick walls?"
 I finally rolled out of bed, and started picking through the pile of bags from our shopping trip, hoping to find something that wouldn't make it look like I'd just won the lottery or robbed a bank.
 "Now you know how Rachel feels.
 I'm afraid that with only a couple of differences, it'll be business as usual."
 I finally settled on a white button-up, and headed to the bathroom so I could change.
 "So are you going to tell me what the differences are, or is that part of the stuff I'm not allowed to know?"
 Alec's chuckle was muffled by the closed door, but still brought a smile to my face.
 "The biggest difference will be that we're going to have to shuffle some class schedules to make sure Brandon and his pack don't have access to you or Rachel.
 Everything else is just kind of a corollary to that.
 At least one pack member will need to be with you whenever you leave the house."

Gray stone walls surrounded us, but I’d been staring at an open sky, nothing but the cloak between my prone form and the cold earth.
 “Where are we?” “Fort Stone,” Steed answered.
 I snickered and Chevelle’s irritation resurfaced.
 I didn’t know if it was for me or Steed.
 “Fort Stone?” I asked anyway.
 “Named for Lord Stone,” Steed explained.
 Chevelle’s gaze caught the other man, leaving no question as to the source of his crossness.
 “A lord?” I tried not to sound too impressed as I took another look around, reassessing the walls.
 I wondered how old it was.

Obviously, she could feel that same power Rodregas had.
 That was interesting.
 She then ran her hand from one to the next until she had touched all twelve books.
 Then, she looked up and her expression reminded Rodregas of some girl who had gotten the perfect mid winter gift that she had been dreaming of.
 “These are not books on magic,” she said.
 “These are Grimoires, several of them of great power.” “Really?” Rodregas said, “I was a squire who learned a little magic, but I really can’t say that I know the difference between a book of magic and a Grimoire.” Imeralda looked surprised and said, “Oh, you guys must depend on the oral tradition.
 That is a hard way to learn.
 The symbols and geometric figures that form a powerful spell are often too complex to learn from just the spoken word.” Rodregas cut in and clarified, “I mean, in the order we did read books on magic theory and history, but I never felt energy from them before.” Imeralda nodded, “Let me explain.

 “I will,” Harruq said.
 Then he was gone, rushing down the streets of Woodhaven toward the calm forest that nestled about it.

 “Aurry, are you there?” he shouted.
 He had hoped the elf would be waiting for him, but as he neared their usual clearing there was no sign of her.
 His heart skipped, and he feared she had already gone off to prepare for battle.

 "Yes.

 She jumped when the microwave beeped.
 Rick took out the bowl, and when he peeled back the paper, steam came out.

 She looked at him in wonder.

 "About what?"
 "Kissing.

 They sat facing each other on the sofa, and Marie reached out to caress his face.
 "Couldn't we kiss and touch instead of talking about it?"
 He took her hand from his cheek, squeezing it.

The prisoners were too dangerous to release, after Ravenhurr had so pissed them off by their imprisonment.
 But people did not question the order of the sorcerer and master of Raven Keep, so it should work.
 He dared not stay longer than he had to; Rodregas did not believe that he could fool Ravenhurr’s guards and servants for long.
 Ravenhurr was a powerful sorcerer who used magic quite casually; it would become quite obvious that Rodregas did not know how to use magic anywhere near Ravenhurr’s level.
 As soon as the keep emptied out for the birthday celebration he would make his escape.
 If he missed this opportunity he was not sure when he could try again.
 It was very rare for an Immortalist to leave his tower, and if he were behaving oddly, the guild would send someone to check on him soon.
 They were careful in their control of the kingdom.
 For a while Rodregas just leaned against the cold stone wall.
 Not thinking of anything, there was too much to think about to even start.

For a second I couldn't even think.
 He'd just used the 'L-word', and my heart felt like it was tearing itself apart inside my chest.
 In the subtle shadings we girls used to measure commitment, it wasn't as good as if he'd come right out and said, 'I love you Adriana Paige', but it was still pretty good, and it was a complete first for me.
 Once I made it past the second part of his statement, I was able to start considering the first part of what he'd said.
 It was horrifying and amazing all at once, and it made complete sense.
 His mom was living in memories because the real world was just a pale shadow of her life with his father.
 Alec seemed to take my silence as condemnation, or possibly just agreement with his self-condemnation.
 "We're where the legends of succubi originated.
 Irresistible demons who drain their victims dry, who leave their lovers a hollow shell of what they were before."
 I'd finally worked through things enough inside my mind, to respond, but he bulldozed right over me.

I thought the whole point of high school was to give us the chance to start making some of our own decisions."
 I grunted something noncommittal as we turned the corner.
 It probably wouldn't have been good enough to save me from having to actually say something, but Brandon was leaning against a wall.
 "I thought it much safer to stay in one place and wait for you rather than wander around and risk getting knocked down."
 I felt my skin flush with embarrassment.
 It was fairly gentle as teasing went, but I hated how my skin looked when I was blushing which meant I blushed more than any two other people.
 Not only that, I couldn't ever come up with anything good to say when someone teased me.
 Brandon seemed to sense my unease, and flashed another gentle smile.
 "I just wanted to find out if you had a way home tonight after you finished up with your math stuff."
 Britney was almost jumping up and down.

International criminal proceedings should be instituted against violators under a new International Criminal Code.
 12.The UN should create its own international surveillance system, including its own satellites, to monitor and report on potential trouble spots and troop movements.
 It should also develop its own appropriate and effective logistics units.
 Criteria to allow UN fact-finding missions in respect of intra-state conflict should be negotiated and codified by the General Assembly.
 At the same time, the UN should integrate fact-finding into enforcement action taken under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.
 A UN Staff College should be established to develop and maintain administrative procedures for governing UN peace-keeping, peace-making and peace-enforcing operations and to train an effective corps of personnel for these purposes.
 Utilization of Defence Resources for Development and the Environment
 1.The concept of 'peace dividend' should be expanded to include manpower, educational and training capabilities, scientific and technological resources, production facilities, land and abandoned military bases that can be redeployed to combat rural and urban poverty as well as national and global environmental degradation.
 An inventory of these resources should be compiled and efforts made to identify alternative uses through the UN's specialized agencies and by national governments.
 All nations should advise the Secretary General of the human, technological and produc tive resources they are willing and able to place at the disposal of the UN.

I don't really like it when people shorten my name.
 Bad associations with nicknames and all that."
 Britney's smile was only a pale imitation of the brilliant thing she'd flashed a few moments previously, but it signaled a willingness to try and make small talk at least.
 "How did you know my name?"
 "Oh, that's easy.
 Sanctuary is the smallest town on the face of the world.
 Anything out of the ordinary is instantly gossip fodder.
 I'll bet half the town knew you and your mom had purchased the old Anderson house before the ink was dry on the mortgage.
 The other half learned about it at church the next day."
 I tried to smile, but I found it more than a little unnerving.

I did not think you would live, much less add to your power and gather more hunters to our pride.” The great Lion shook his head, the ways of the winds and the speech of gods were the same, fickle and not to be truly understood.
 Yet he sensed that somehow the words sounded fair and right in some way that he could not really explain.
 Blodeuwedd smiled at him, a smile that answered nothing but claimed to answer everything.
 The two continued to walk through the tall grass.
 After a few minutes she spoke, “The Gods and Daemon Lords are allowed to choose champions, but are not allowed to speak directly to any mortal.
 For this moment you are enough in the Celestial Realm for me to ask you a question: I don’t understand why you have chosen that.” As she spoke she raised her slim perfect arm and pointed at his shadow.
 He lowered his great head and studied the dark shape.
 The great lion had to admit the shadow was odd, slimmer than his great bulk, strangely dark in the day and the shadow’s eyes seem to glow the bright yellow color of flame.
 He shook his great head and mane as if to free it from the strange shadow, and growled, “You are a Goddess; you can see all.” Blodeuwedd nodded, she forgot to walk for a moment, as if in deep thought, but still she kept up with the Great Lion stalking through the grassland.

 “Come.

 The two left the building and joined the fighting on the streets.
 It did not take long before a group of soldiers spotted them.

He looked at my face, searching, and finally let out a breathless, “Magic.” His face was filled with wonder.
 I had seen many impressed with my talents, but never with such an effortless show.
 I laughed to myself.
 It was refreshing to have someone so genuinely awed.
 He didn’t ask to see what else I could do; he wasn’t sizing me up for battle.
 I smiled at him and he seemed to think that alone a reward.
 He was still speechless.
 “Well, shall you stay, then?” “Forever,” he gushed.
 It was a curious response but I had begun to think he wasn’t that different, aside from the obvious lack of magic, skill, and grace.
 Moreover, where many of the others lacked beauty, he did not.

"You on the other hand definitely need to spend every night at the math lab.
 Your homework was incomplete, and of the problems you bothered to attempt, you didn't do a single one correctly.
 Britney, you're headed towards a failing grade, and while you might not care, your father most certainly does.
 Make my class a priority, or I'll stop in for a checkup and let slip just how poorly you're doing to dear old Dad, and then you'll find yourself riding the bus to school."
 It was a vicious threat, but one almost guaranteed to have an effect.
 Britney most definitely didn't want to be stuck riding the bus with all of the junior high kids and other assorted 'losers'.
 Her mouth opened and closed several times and then she nodded and fled the classroom.
 When I finally caught up with her she'd recovered enough to complain, but there was a breathless nature to her voice that told me she wouldn't be skipping the math lab for a little while.
 I made non-committal noises as we waited in line, all the while scanning the cafeteria for two faces.

“You will know.” She motioned for us to move up to the doors.
 I walked slowly and leaned forward to see the symbol.
 Amazingly, I walked right up to the one with an arrow on it.

 I sighed and pushed open my door.
 The small room also had glass ceilings but they were dimmer.
 The room was dark and cold, with dust in the air.

Rodregas was too close to dodge, and the rake hit his wounded gut straight on with the full brunt of his attacker’s weight.
 Rodregas swooned in pain as his fresh wound took the blunt of the blow.
 He had started to feel like he was faster and stronger than everyone else, and had not been expected the power of the blow.
 Rodregas went flying back down to the ground moaning.
 He rolled with it and came back up.
 Rodregas thought about the attacker and realized that here was one that would be a challenge.
 Judging by the distance his attacker kept and how he was clearly keeping his center of gravity low and balanced, Rodregas knew this opponent was a challenge.
 He was not just bigger and stronger; clearly he knew how to fight.

"Thank you," she said, raising her lips to his.
 She seemed to have recovered, Rick mused as he watched her try on white sandals half an hour later.
 He never would have believed he could enjoy shopping, but he loved watching her discover new styles and new toys.
 He'd bought her a pocket calculator on the way to the shoe store.
 They were going to Teri's for dinner the next evening, and Marie showered and put on her new white dress and sandals when they got back from the shore.
 "How do I look?"
 she asked Rick when she joined him downstairs.
 "Beautiful."
 She was even darker than she'd been yesterday when she'd tried on the dress, and the contrast the dress made with her hair and skin was striking.

He was very impressed by the quality of the archery on display.
 Clearly everyone knew what they were about.
 He ended up being behind a tall young man.
 Rodregas almost thought he might have some AElf blood.
 It also looked like he might have a broken nose from the previous day’s competition.
 The young man did very well, hitting all five targets.
 His shot on the moving target only nicked the edge, still impressive.

For a moment the Heavenly Realm was silent.
 All the creatures knew the roar.
 The great Celestial Lion was on the hunt and when he found his prey, there would be a battle to shake all the realms.
 As the roar faded in the heavens, a new Knight Captain, a chosen Champion of a Goddess, stood in the great Cathedral of the Heavens.
 He heard the roar because it was his.
 The other hunters in his pride were at his side and ready.
 It was time to start the hunt.

 Despite my best efforts, I was mumbling so badly I wasn't sure anything I'd said was comprehensible.
 Somewhere in there I'd closed my eyes, so I felt a sluggish, tired kind of surprise when he gently brushed his fingers across the side of my face.
 The sensation was so feathery I almost opened my eyes to verify that he'd really touched me.

 Besides, I didn't really want to know if he hadn't touched me, it was better to just go on pretending he had.

The disappointment must have shown on my face.
 He reached a hand up and brushed my hair behind an ear.
 “Don’t worry, sunshine, I will see you again.” I smiled a little and he winked at me.
 Chevelle stiffened at my side as he often did when Steed touched me so casually, and I couldn’t help but think of being alone with him after tonight.
 My stomach tightened and suddenly in comparison the mountains didn’t seem like such a big deal.
 The next morning Steed said goodbye privately to Chevelle and then came to where I stood with the horses, stroking one’s neck.
 “You’ll remember me, butterfly?” I smiled in return.
 “Always.” “Yes, well, at least as long as he’s yours.” He patted the horse.
 “Mine?” He smiled and swung onto his horse, nodding farewell as he spun and galloped east.

 Given different times, a different circumstance.
 He said something odd to me one time, he said: “Bud, music is a bad demon to have.

 If I could have done anything else I would have.”  And, of course, he did, I mean playing at the Vapors wasn’t bringing in enough money to support his small family, so he did books for a paint store.
 He had a business degree, was something of a math whiz, I think, and he worked in the back room of this paint store in a strip shopping center, most days.
 Sometimes my friends and I would walk up there and visit him.

 He fired arrows three at a time, his quiver never approaching empty.
 He ordered Sonowin lower, shouting out the command as another barrage of bone pelted four more elves to their deaths.
 Skimming above the darkness, Dieredon fired volley after volley behind him.
 When they were past the undead, he pulled Sonowin high into the air to observe the battlefield.
 The ranks of the undead were half of what they had been, yet still he could not see the lowered black hood he so badly needed to see.
 “Come, Sonowin, we will find him, even if it means killing every last one of his puppets.”
 The horse neighed and dove, spurred on by the sight of its own kind falling in death.

I just needed to know when and where the narcotics squad wanted to do this deal and what I needed to do next.
 The Officer was excited at the opportunity to get this guy and he arranged me coming to the police station so I could make the call to set up the one hundred Oxy pill deal on a recorded phone line.
 The drug deal itself would happen later and I would need to be evasive and the where and the when as to the actual exchange of money for drugs.
 I was told to call her from my phone and tell her I would call her tomorrow around noon.
 Chapter 18: Game Time I arrived at the station and was escorted to an interrogation room.
 It looked like a carbon copy of the room I was in before but it was further down the hall.
 Officer White connected a recording device to my crack-berry and I was told to place the call and get Ashley to engage in conversation that would be incriminating.
 I was to get her to use the word “Oxy” and discuss the price and the quantity and to get Ashley to acknowledge that the price was “$2500 cash for the one hundred Oxys.” I placed the call, nervous and anxious to be sure to get what the police wanted.
 To my shock, the recording on Ashley’s phone stated it was no longer in service.
 The officer was obviously disappointed and suggested that perhaps they caught on to the scheme, as they were very savvy.

A feint, so quick Harruq blocked on instinct, took care of the other.
 His weapons gone, the half-orc was exposed.
 Dieredon wasted no time smashing the half-orc’s groin.
 As he doubled over in pain, a snap kick smacked his chin, splattering blood and forcing him to drop.
 The sharp tip of a blade pressed against Harruq’s throat before he knew what was happening.
 “Move,” Dieredon said.
 “Please, move.
 Give me an excuse to kill you.”
 Harruq was too stunned and disoriented to give him what he wanted.
 Instead he lied there, his nose throbbing and his swords limp in his hands.

I should have been overjoyed I wasn't in trouble.

Many windows decorated the front, all covered with silken curtains.
 The fence surrounded the entire property, black iron spiked ten feet at the top.
 “How do we get in?” Harruq asked.
 Qurrah examined the fence, his face locked in a frown.
 “I don’t know.
 I have no spells that can aid us.”
 The bigger half-orc stood and stretched his muscles.

Imeralda was literally flying through the air and she had her dagger drawn.
 She did not land smoothly, colliding into Van’dret’s lower body, but she instantly straightened and thrust her dagger into Van’dret’s stomach.
 The dagger did not sink far; a few inches.
 Rodregas expected Van’dret to get his hands up and fend her off, but he seemed to be in shock.
 Imeralda pulled the dagger out and then viscously stuck it back in the sorcerer, her body moved with the stroke, clearly using every ounce of strength she had.
 Still the blade only stuck in a few inches, but Van’dret screamed and fell to the floor and started to drag himself away.
 As soon as the surprisingly high pitch of Van’dret scream sounded, both Doi’van’s and Rodregas’ feet were free.
 Rodregas stumbled for a moment, but was running almost, even as he caught himself.
 Imeralda was stepping forward with the dagger to finish Van’dret, but he caught her arm and said, “Wait.

I bolted upright, batting at them as if my shirt were on fire.

 My head came up once more, and the woman gasped.

They shook so hard he dropped it and he sunk to the ground.
 I saw him place his head under his arms and he curled himself in a tight bundle.
 He shook and I heard him do something that I thought Seth never did.
 He cried.
 I stepped out from behind the tree and walked over to him.
 He didn’t hear me, or look up.
 I wasn’t mad at him anymore for not telling me what I wanted to know.

Brandon was very ill detoxing, and the fact that he had been busted and he was on lockdown at his parents’ house was common knowledge on the street.
 There’s no easy way to bluff if everyone sees your cards.
 Officer White cooked up a scheme.
 He gave Brandon a phone number and a story for him to give to Steve.
 Hopefully this story would explain Brandon’s bust, now known by all of his associates: He was to acknowledge his bust and tell Steve that the cops didn’t catch him with drugs because no one would front him the Oxy he was to bring to the deal.
 Brandon owed everyone, including Steve, so that would not be difficult to believe.
 In fact, that part was the truth!
 He was then supposed to tell Steve that he needed help supplying one of his regulars while his parents were holding him with a tight leash and ask him if he could do it.
 All Brandon was asking for in return for this connection was a few Oxy pills dropped at our house as a referral fee.
 Brandon asked Steve to just put the pills on his windowsill so he could get high unbeknownst to his parents.

Most major Immortalist keeps and other magic locations are located either on one, or where two of them cross.
 Magicians love them for all the free magical power just flowing by to use.
 But while there is plenty of power it is not easy to use.
 The power is naturally full of disturbances and chaotic energies.
 The horror stories of magicians having terrible accidents with spells gone crazy on ley lines were legend.
 This is why Immortalists used circles to manage the power.
 Raven Keep was on such a line but you could not feel it due to the powerful circles built into the tower.
 It was probably why Raven Town was not closer.

I was even paler than normal, with dark circles under my eyes that only a crack addict could possibly find attractive.
 A hot shower did a little to make me more presentable, I tried to hide the shadows with some makeup, and then finally gave up after botching the second application, and just put on some mascara and eyeliner.
 The mundane process of getting ready for the day wore away some of the edge to my nightmare.
 It was already starting to seem more like a normal, safe dream.
 I put on jeans and a button-up shirt, and then all but stumbled downstairs with my backpack in hand.
 Sometime during the night Mom had put our message board up on the fridge.
 Went shopping, food in the fridge, don't forget breakfast and lunch.

I shook my head gingerly, surprised when I didn't feel the twinge I knew was coming.

 I'm not used to it.

 Alec looked at me doubtfully, then took a deep, no doubt calming breath, and shrugged.
 The movement seemed too casual, almost as if he was angry, but trying to hide it.

And they had no idea what had happened to her.

 She smiled, his words bringing her out of her reverie.
 Yesterday he'd told her he loved her more times than he had the previous four or five days combined.
 And that was saying a lot.
 He hated having to go to work this morning.
 What if, now that he was trying so hard not to think about anything in 1927, his mind wandered to it?
 He knew he wouldn't be able to bear it if he went home and found that she had disappeared.
 After nearly four hours of trying to concentrate on his work, he gave up and told his secretary that he wasn't feeling well and was going home.

They were parading around a blazing camp fire, mumbling and talking about things I couldn’t hear over the flames.

 Then all of them suddenly broke out into an ominous song: “He will rise to the heavens, from the very pits of hell.
 To take control of our world, and the gift- less ones as well.
 “He will rule with a flaming torch, and save those who are worthy.
 And for those who aren’t, Well, you better watch out!” They all broke out in crazed laughs, which gave me the impression that each and every one of them was mad.
 Hell, I knew they were already mad.
 They threw dirt at the fire and continued their wild laughs.

Employment Strategies for the Industrial Nations
 In the industrial countries, the phenomena of jobless growth coupled with persistently high rates of youth unemployment and of chronic unemployment among the poorer sections will not be eradicated by even the most optimistic rates of economic expansion or mere incremental adjustments within the context of present attitudes and policies.
 Although the problem has been aggravated by a variety of short- and medium-term factors whose effects will gradually dissipate over time – defence cuts, recession, East European economic crisis, German reunification, etc.
 – the present job crisis among Western nations is largely structural in nature.
 Although conditions vary from country to country, the crisis impacts most heavily on the unskilled, young people, urban poor, ethnic minorities and older workers.
 Specific programmes to effect structural changes will have to be introduced in order to ensure a fair opportunity to all, especially minority youth, to lead economically active lives.
 It is in this context that the European Union, the United States and other Western governments have been considering ambitious proposals for addressing this issue.
 The Australian government has unveiled a $4.6 billion jobs package to reduce unemployment from 10 per cent to 5 per cent by the end of the decade by encouraging training for the young, the unskilled and the long-term unemployed.
 Recently the OECD has presented the main planks of an employment strategy to stimulate economic growth in the industrial nations, make labour markets more flexible, increase productivity, and revamp employment and unemployment security provisions.
 The relative success of the US economy in creating jobs during the past decade has prompted other countries to emphasize the importance of policies to increase the flexibility of wage rates and bring down the price of labour by reductions in the statutory minimum wage.

ole, therefore, is the balance of payments.92m The0m unemployment92m rate0m in Australia, 25 November, remains low. However, the strength and recovery of the US economy92m in0m the relatively very young, isolated workers that have been found in many92m other0m industrial nations has veered from a serious line of92m supportive0m German reunification

 “I will give you a short version of events so when the subject comes up—and believe me, someone will ask—you are not overcome by curiosity and forced to seek less than honorable venues to discover the facts.” I chose to ignore the jab about my eavesdropping.
 “My mother was a power-hungry wench seeking notoriety.
 She was an elemental fairy and, like me, sported a fine head of red hair.” She ran a hand under the curls for emphasis.
 “She heard a story one day of a mixed-species birth and got it in her head she could breed a more powerful magic.
 Apparently she thought she could control her offspring and use the magic to her advantage… I suppose she thought she could rule the world.” Ruby smirked.

The rest of the day went in starts and stutters.
 I went from answering a question about the economy of post-Civil War Georgia, to watching Alec start putting together rough plans for our next group project.
 I had just enough time to notice he seemed relieved I wasn't trying to get in his way, and then Spanish was finishing up and I was headed to the tutoring lab.
 Most Friday afternoon sessions were pretty sparsely attended.
 Today was no different, which was a good thing since I probably wouldn't have done a very good job of explaining anything.
 Mrs. Campbell shut everything down before my shift started, and sent me home with a concerned look in her eye.
 Rachel skipped over to my table while I was still trying to get my books put away.

He’d always have to go save someone in some dramatic fashion.
 The things that would come out of his mouth were completely unbelievable lies and his ignorance was evident to all.
 As a parent, I was humiliated when Brandon spoke.
 We encouraged him to seek help, but as an adult Brandon had to want help and he had to consent to help.
 The thought of Brandon being addicted to drugs, overdosing, getting arrested was all too torturous to contemplate, but we did it anyway.
 How could we not?
 He was our son.
 I was so angry at Brandon at one point that I stood with a hammer over the Chevelle and considered destroying it.
 The Chevelle sitting unfinished in the garage had become a grim symbol of the disappointment I felt with my son.
 Instead, I arranged to have it towed to a friend’s shop with the agreement that Brandon and I would show up together twice a week and work towards finishing the project with the assistance of a professional (and the expectations of someone other than Dad).

Rodregas asked, “Why did the Immortalist Taiga capture my friend Doi’van and keep him in his Menagerie of Earth, Sky and Fire for two years before selling him to Ravenhurr?
 He is a Hellborn and should have been of no interest to those trying to become Celestial Gods.” Van’dret became very still at this question, for a long moment he neither moved nor spoke.
 Rodregas wondered briefly if he even breathed or if the powerful sorcerer had moved beyond such mortal needs.
 Finally Van’dret said, “I cannot say what was in the minds of others.” Van’dret started to raise his hand and Rodregas spoke quickly trying to keep him engaged, “So, are you saying there are not Immortalists led by Taiga who are breaking ‘The One Law’ set by both the Gods in the Celestial Realm and the Daemon Lordsin the Infernal to keep balance?” Van’dret went pale at Rodregas words and then he stood up very tall.
 For the first time true anger was in his words, “You do not know what you are getting in the middle of.
 You are barely more than a squire and yet you would get in a battle of beings so much greater than you?” The Immortalist went from anger to laughter, but his laughter did not last long.
 His laughter was like all things Immortalist, beautiful but cold.
 When it ended he said simply, “Time for the three of you to die.” What Rodregas did next he knew was meaningless, but he hoped it would give Imeralda a last chance to act.
 He reached inside where he used to find his ‘itch,’ except his former little magical power was now a raging volcano.
 He had learned from Imeralda a new spell to make light; he waved his hands,  mumbled the incantation, and then threw all his power, and sent it straight at Van’dret in a stream of energy that felt like a river of lava flowing from his hands.

Throw in Jasmin's congratulations, which seemed to indicate the passing grade had been nothing less than inevitable, with Alec taking my hand as soon as I sat down, and Jessica and James' lack of response didn't matter at all.
 With Isaac's reassuring presence at my side in History, I weathered the renewed gossip, apparently occasioned by the entire pack's absence during lunch for the second day in a row, and soon found myself reunited with Alec in Physics.
 As luck would have it, Mrs. Alexander was gone again, and the substitute was typically clueless about what we were supposed to be doing.
 Alec of course spent the whole class unearthing other little bits of embarrassing information.
 I'd never experienced anything like it, every question I answered spawned two more, and he invariably seemed to figure out the underlying reasons I'd done a given thing, or reacted a certain way.
 I'd just finished describing my failed tryout for the school's production of To Kill a Mockingbird, when he hit me with a completely unexpected question.
 "So tell me about both your best date and your worst date before you came here."
 I felt my skin instantly heat up, and looked down, unable to meet his gaze.
 He let me sit there for a couple of seconds, and then reached out and used one gentle finger to nudge my chin up.
 "What's the matter, afraid I'll be jealous?"

“I will be fine.

 A neigh brought his attention upward.
 Sonowin landed next to him, her white hair stained red in places.
 She nuzzled the elf and snorted something.
 “You worry too much, old girl,” Dieredon said, his voice cracking several times.
 He patted her once and then turned to the elf standing nearby.
 “How many did we lose?”
 “Half.

Surely Junnie would have more to say.
 She placed a gentle hand on my shoulder and led me in.
 “What shall we do today?” I went back over our conversation, trying to find some meaning.
 Inspiration, or maybe distraction, hit me as I recalled the dark-headed stranger.
 “Lineages.” Junnie raised an eyebrow as I sped to the study, but I’d worry about Evelyn later.
 This was my chance to find out about this Chevelle Vattier.
 After a dozen or so volumes, my determination began to falter.
 There were so many lineages, but I needed something on the northern clans, something on Vattier, and Junnie didn’t have that.
 I’d need a library, maybe even the Council library.

I am far too tense to be sleepy, but I am dazed by the constant parade of memories and possibilities that march through my head as I attempt to digest thousands of thoughts—hell bent on answering the question: Why do I sit here?
 It has been many years since I have been involved in a drug deal, and my assumption is that the process hasn’t changed much.
 My mother has been through too much pain and I can’t imagine what affect it would have on her to visit another family member in jail if things go badly tonight.
 I think about the deep secret I have now and what my mother would think, and those defining moments that led me here.
 Chapter 2: Small Town Whispers Sometimes life’s secrets begin with life itself.
 My mother discovered she was pregnant with my older brother Thomas while she was still a high school student in a tiny town in Kansas.
 To this day the town still has brick streets and tiny homes that are a throwback to simpler times.
 The town is so small that the phonebook is about the size of a comic book.
 It was 1957 and she was impregnated by her boyfriend in the back seat of his parents’ car.
 My mother and father decided to sneak out to a neighboring town and get married after they discovered her pregnancy.

Although the next step was slamming or injecting in his veins, he hadn’t gone that far.
 He was up to about thirty Oxy pills a day and couldn’t sell enough to supply his habit.
 While he had been living on less since his home lock-down, he was really never clean during this detox.
 How was Brandon going to achieve what these cops wanted in his condition and with his new reputation as a snitch?
 I am the father, with all that that means.
 I am the man of the family, and I would do anything to protect my family but I was in unchartered territory here once again.
 What would Dino NOT do?
 What would Richard NOT do?
 I looked the undercover narcotics officer in the face and blurted, “I’ll do the bust!” I’m raising my freaking hand like I am volunteering to coach a soccer team.
 I believe firmly that the deal to bust Steve should be forgiven due to the failure on the part of the police and the complete and total fiasco that had come from the officers not doing their homework and giving Brandon the same number that Steve already knew was an undercover cop’s phone.

Laying her on her bed, he smoothed her hair.
 She had been here for over four weeks, and she'd had no indication that there was a way back to 1927.
 She could be here for the rest of her life, but he knew that until she accepted that, until she decided that she wanted to stay here, she'd never be totally his.
 And he wanted her to be his, heart, body, mind, and soul.

 Rick went down to the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea.
 He'd wait an hour and see if Marie wanted him to make her breakfast.
 He hoped she'd forgive him soon.
 He'd hate to waste a whole Sunday fighting.
 He took his tea out to the garden.
 Gazing at the white roses, he sighed, wishing Marie would come down and share the beauty of the morning with him.
 He couldn't blame her for being mad, but he was getting desperate.

The week had flown by much faster than expected.
 Especially considering how slowly each individual day had dragged along.
 Most of my waking hours had been spent wondering if Saturday night was ever going to arrive.
 My train of thought shattered as I got my first glimpse of the interior of what'd become my own personal Mecca.
 The exterior of the building had been impressive, complete with statues and sculptures reminiscent of an eighteenth-century opera house, but I hadn't expected the illusion to hold once I passed through the enormous, gilded doors.
 I'd been wrong.
 The floors were a gorgeous marble which drew the eyes to the nearest golden-white wall, and up the elaborate gilded trim towards vaulted ceilings.
 It was like walking into a palace, complete with painted, spun-sugar clouds, and burgundy drapes made out of rich velvet.
 If it wasn't for the press of people pushing me from behind, I probably would've stayed in the front entryway right up until the sound of the orchestra filtered down to me.
 As it was, I only got a few hurried looks before being rushed along with the rest of the students.

 As the two brothers left, another soul traveled in the dark.
 He made not a sound as he moved.
 Any attempts at tracking his passage would be utterly futile, for not a single blade of grass remained bent when his foot stepped away.
 He was Dieredon, Scoutmaster of the Quellan elves, and few souls could match his silence, speed, or skills with blade and bow.

In the face of the near-universal apathy expressed by the rest of the student body, it took my mind several seconds to process exactly what had been said.
 I grabbed Brandon's arm and shook it to get his attention.
 "Did he just say they were drawing for free tickets?"
 Brandon looked slightly amused.
 Cassie, who I'd just interrupted, looked very much not amused.
 "I think so.
 I wasn't paying very close attention, but I think he did."
 The sound that came out of my mouth was disturbingly close to a squeal, but I was too excited to care.
 I waved goodbye as I stood and headed towards the doors.
 Amazingly enough, there was already a line in the office by the time I got there.

"It's okay Rachel.
 I'm sorry I overreacted at finding out my attacks were public knowledge.
 It was mostly meant for Britney."
 She cocked her head slightly to the side and looked at me with incredibly large blue eyes that seemed older than they had a few seconds before.
 "It really bothers you that everyone knows?"
 I shrugged uncomfortably.
 "I guess maybe it shouldn't, but it does.
 Nobody likes to be ridiculed, but it's even more than that.

I whisper in one call as if I can’t talk because I am still stuck at home with my wife and cannot talk freely.

 Am I dead?
 Finally the crew is all present behind the store, and the review of protocol and procedure began as it did before.
 New officers are in amongst familiar faces from the prior attempt.
 I find myself less interested in their chat as I mentally prepare myself for the task at hand.
 I am given the weapons and shots fired instructions again.
 In my usual humorous deflection of discomfort, I quip that the last time I met Ashley it was a “happy ending” and I would like the same result this time.

There were only about twenty Ravenhurr guardsmen.
 If they were sent in every possible direction, especially in pairs, there was a good chance that he would come across no more than two of them at a time.
 If they were still confused about whether he was or was not Ravenhurr, he would have an excellent chance of overcoming them.
 On the other hand, if the forces of the guild came after him… The guardsmen of the Immortalist guild were known as the Immortal Guards and their reputation as the premier fighters of the realm was seldom questioned.
 If they found out what had happened at Raven Keep there was not much chance for Rodregas’ survival.
 After a simple meal, a good rub down for the horses and a few hours of rest, Rodregas got the wagon back on the road.
 If he could keep up this pace, up he could be well hidden before any forces could find him.
 At the end of the second day, before he had come to his last turn off, he realized that he would have to get some sleep.
 He was feeling exhausted.

But I was never good at that anyway.
 I shook my head.
 He nodded, giving up, but our hands still lay together, connecting us.
 “Where are they?” I asked.
 He’d been looking at our hands, but his eyes returned to my face at the question.
 “Council,” I explained.
 “They have retreated.
 They were able to briefly incapacitate the wolves, giving Rhys and Rider less warning of their approach before you were attacked.” He hesitated.
 “When we heard the alert, I turned.

“Swear you will keep my secret and you live, do not and you die.
 Choose!” Audrian just stood there looking at him.
 Then he nodded and said, “In the name of the All-Father, Lord of Sky and Earth and Water, I swear that I will keep your secrets.” Rodregas nodded and relaxed slightly; few would dare break a promise to the All-Father.
 Rodregas decided that Brit and Geor were like pale shadows as they quickly followed suit.
 When he turned to the last two he saw that they were very interested in what he was saying.
 “Where do you go, Sir Paladin?” He showed no sense of humor at Rodregas’ little joke about being a Paladin; Rodregas hoped Doi’van had not taken him literally.
 “As far as I can, is my main plan at the moment.
 Clearly the Guild of the Celestial Path is going to be looking for me.
 Let’s just say I don’t wish to be found anywhere right now.” “And if they find you… and they will in time, will you then become a Vengeance Daemon?” asked the Hellborn.

I watched bemusedly as Mrs. Alexander searched through her pockets for something to write with for at least half a minute before realizing she'd placed her pen behind her ear.
 The form now signed, the pen went back behind her ear for safekeeping, and she motioned me to a seat, predictably at the back of the classroom.
 As I negotiated the crooked path between desks, I found myself looking forward to the class.
 Right up until Alec slipped into the classroom a few seconds before the bell rang.
 If there'd been any justice in the universe, he'd have somehow gotten uglier over the last few hours.
 That or I'd have developed some kind of partial immunity to him.
 Neither was the case, he was just as unearthly gorgeous as he'd been in the hall.
 The sight of him was almost overwhelming.
 As he slipped into a desk an aisle away from me, I tried to breathe deeply and slowly in a futile effort to calm my racing heart.
 It helped a little when he slid the desk back a few feet.

"Like I said, I'll let you drive in a parking lot tomorrow.
 I'll pick up a booklet for you to study one day this week."
 She woke up so excited the next morning that she jumped into her clothes, ran through the garden, and was racing up the stairs less than ten minutes after she'd awakened.
 "Rick!"
 she called, running into her bedroom to get her bathrobe.
 "Rick, wake up!
 It's almost 8:00!"
 Rick groaned, wishing he'd told her that driving wasn't allowed before 10:00 a.m.
 He turned over and went back to sleep, but 15 minutes later, after her shower, she pounded on his door.

I debated searching through them all, but it would just mean another fight if I did find them.
 With a sigh of resignation I walked over to the chair where I'd left my selections from the night before, and pulled the faded jeans up my frail-looking legs.
 I finished up with a tank top, covered by a light blue blouse.
 All Cindi's stuff.
 Thoughts of her were just as dangerous as they'd been last night, but maybe I was getting a little better.
 Feeling like a traitor, I headed my skittering thoughts off before they could start affecting me physically, and focused on the next step in getting ready.
 There was a lot more at stake this morning than last night.
 If I fell apart now I might not make it to school, and then I'd have all kinds of trouble calming Mom back down when she returned from wherever she'd gone.
 My hair hung as limp and straight as always.
 No amount of styling ever made it look any better, just more contrived.

"You hit your head pretty hard; I really think we should get you to the office.

 The comment about hitting my head settled me down.
 It wasn't until we were out in the hall that I realized my head didn't hurt.
 That was probably a really bad sign.
 "Let go of my hands."
 Alec unpinned my arms, set me down, and then chuckled as I started gingerly probing my scalp.
 "What are you doing?
 You didn't actually hit your head.
 I caught you before you hit the ground."

Just as I was about to release my arrow, the dwarf cried, “Please stop!” I don’t know why I listened to him but I didn’t pull the string.
 The dwarf was acting different than the others; its pudgy eyes were filled with fear at the sight of my arrow.
 “Why?” Seth growled.
 “Your kind has done nothing good to us except make us confused and our lives more complicated.” The dwarf looked startled.
 “Oh you’ll have to excuse my brethren; they have a tendency to be rather annoying.” He took a long frightened look at Seth’s sword.
 “Good sir, before you try to slay me, I have a message to deliver from her majesty.” I lowered my bow because I had a feeling I wanted to know what this message was.
 If it was a lie, Seth and I could kill him anyway in a blink of an eye.
 “Seth, maybe we should hear what he has to say.” “I’ve had enough of listening to dwarfs,” Seth hissed.
 “All they bring me is bad news.” The dwarf was trembling.
 “Oh please, sir, listen to the good lady!

I gave her my best reassuring smile as she left, and then watched as she and the other tutors all bounced from one student to the next answering questions.
 As much as I would have liked to just call it a day, another good effort added to what I'd done earlier would put me two or maybe even three days ahead of my personal schedule.
 With a sigh of resignation I found my place on the page again, and started sorting out another set of variables.
 Forty-five minutes later I'd nearly completed another two sections, and was more than ready for a breather.
 Sometime while I'd been studying, most of the kids had left.
 I hadn't expected all of them to stay until my shift started, but I'd expected more than the two or three I usually had.
 Only it didn't look like that was going to be the case.
 Apparently most of them hadn't been serious about learning the material--they'd just wanted to come to the lab, make a half-hearted attempt, and then leave secure in the knowledge that if they failed the test they could whine to their parents about how hard they'd worked.
 But Mom, I even went to the lab.
 It sort of made sense though.

 "I don't want to lose you either.

 To desperately want two things when you can only have one?"
 "No."
 He glanced at her.
 "I just wish I was the one you wanted most."
 She caught her breath, covering her mouth with her hand and running from the room.
 Rick hated himself for pushing her like that, but he couldn't seem to help it.
 He was desperate.

Before I’d moved an inch I was back down.
 My pulse pounded in my temples as I struggled to recall what had happened the night before.
 I hissed out a low oath when I remembered Ruby leaning toward me, blowing her glitter in my face.
 My eyes opened again to find Chevelle offering me a glass.
 I winced, unsure of what exactly I had said to him.
 I knew it was bad, but couldn’t quite piece it back together.
 I glanced up at him timidly.
 “Thank you,” I croaked as I took the cup, my hand trembling.
 “Shouldn’t have left you alone,” he said quietly.
 There was a tinkling laugh in the front room and I groaned.

“My father wanders the mountain… killing fairies.” My jaw dropped.
 “You mean Ruby is your sister?” “Half-sister,” he emphasized.
 He let me roll that around for a while before he spoke again.
 “You know, Ruby told me she’d had dealings with the infamous Chevelle Vattier, but I didn’t believe her.
 One can never believe the tales of a fairy.” Infamous?
 “But imagine my surprise when he walked out of the trees, following a green-eyed beauty.” Steed smiled at the memory and then turned serious.
 “When I ran into the… trackers, I had hope Ruby had told the truth and might know where to find you.” He laughed.
 “She tried to hide you, but I recognized the horses out front.” “She tried to hide us?” “Ah, yes.

As I let go, I realized I’d gotten blood on my hands, so I headed to the hall and poured water from the pitcher into a ceramic basin.
 Staring into the mirror was not my favorite pastime.
 It mostly made my head hurt.
 But I had to clean the blood from my face and straighten the nest of hair on my head.
 When I leaned forward, a flash caught my eye.
 For a moment I thought the pendant was reflecting light from somewhere in the dark hallway, but my brain must have been still muddled from sleep.
 I examined the stone closer and saw blood had gotten smudged there as well, so I rinsed it clean.
 I lingered there, clutching it tight in my hand.
 It was a comfort to hold.
 It seemed to warm something deep within me.

A wordless hiss escaped my throat as I felt the fire coursing through me light in my hands.
 He would burn for this.
 Burn.
 I was standing now, walking step for step toward him as he backed away.
 He said nothing, his face calm as the fire flared and I raised my hands to strike.
 And then everything went black.
 That was when I heard the chanting.
 My ears had been roaring with anger, but all that was left was a soft recitation.

Taking in the two groups, I was amazed at the disparity before my eyes.
 The kids behind Brandon were half again as many as the gathering behind Alec, and they were eager for the confrontation, watching with excited eyes, and large smiles.
 Alec's company on the other hand awaited the coming fight with calm exteriors and a sense they were bowing before the inevitable conflict without conceding anything to their opponents.
 They were fewer in number, but the men were larger than anyone other than Alec or Brandon, and I somehow knew even the girls were dangerous.
 With a sudden start I realized the confrontation wasn't between Brandon and Alec as I'd originally thought.
 Instead the stuck-up blonde I'd first met in the office, was squared off against a brunette less than three-quarters her size.
 As Britney pulled us even closer, almost into the dead zone between the two factions, I finally realized the smaller girl was Rachel.
 "You're going to get what's coming to you, you little slut."
 The blonde's voice sounded exactly like I'd imagined, arrogant, vindictive and only barely controlled.
 Rachel on the other hand sounded calm, speaking in tones I shouldn't have been able to hear, except the spectators were unnaturally quiet.

 "But how did you know I wanted you to kiss me?"
 "By the way you were looking at me."
 "How was I looking at you?"
 "Like you wanted me to kiss you."
 He grinned again as he reached for the eggs.
 She frowned, trying to remember what expression she must have had on her face that night.
 But she hadn't been thinking about how she looked; she'd been thinking about how he looked.
 And how his lips would feel on hers.

Rodregas expected Van’dret to get his hands up and fend her off, but he seemed to be in shock.
 Imeralda pulled the dagger out and then viscously stuck it back in the sorcerer, her body moved with the stroke, clearly using every ounce of strength she had.
 Still the blade only stuck in a few inches, but Van’dret screamed and fell to the floor and started to drag himself away.
 As soon as the surprisingly high pitch of Van’dret scream sounded, both Doi’van’s and Rodregas’ feet were free.
 Rodregas stumbled for a moment, but was running almost, even as he caught himself.
 Imeralda was stepping forward with the dagger to finish Van’dret, but he caught her arm and said, “Wait.
 Stop, let me.
 He should be as strong as I am.
 Let me and Doi’van get in close.” She hesitated, but nodded and handed her dagger to him.
 Doi’van pounded past the two and picked Van’dret off the ground, by the front of his robes, and gave him a backhanded slap across the face.

I'd been right, which had made me glad I'd compromised and come in my one and only sun dress.
 Alec apparently hadn't gotten the memo.
 He was in an honest-to-goodness full tux.
 I wasn't the only one stunned by how good he looked; there was a ripple of turned heads as people noticed his entrance.
 He paced the short distance down to the back row of seats with such incredible grace that I felt my mouth go dry.
 No one person should be so attractive, not when there wasn't enough of him to go around to every single woman in the world.
 For a few seconds I forgot all about the reasons I didn't like him, and just wished he was sitting in front of me instead of two rows behind me where I couldn't see him.
 Then I realized what his arrival really meant.
 Rachel had stood me up.

“You’re jealous because I’m not covered in grass.” “Not yet,” I said, my voice dripping with sarcasm.
 I lunged at him and he rolled to the side.

 The whole time we were laughing like two crazy six year olds.
 Who knew that you could have fun in a place like this?
 Life is full of happy surprises.

It was entirely different when you weren't sure you could trust the people around you.
 Brandon was too good to be true.
 I pretty much expected any day now he'd come to his senses and realize he could do a lot better.
 Right or not, it's hard to really become emotionally invested when you feel like that.
 Rachel on the other hand should have been the perfect friend, but I got the feeling she'd always choose her brother over me.
 I felt guilty for holding that against her, family should be important.
 Cindi's friends back in Minnesota had probably felt similarly, but I'd always been really careful not to make her choose between me and them.
 Alec seemed like the type who'd force a decision just because he could.
 I felt my heart go crazy at the same time tears started gathering at the corner of my eyes.
 It was stupid to have risked a panic attack when I was already borderline depressed, but that was what I was looking at now.

Economic growth and expansion of employment in one country enhance employment opportunities in other countries as well.
 Therefore, co ordination of policies is in the interests of the global community.
 A comprehensive and coordinated international effort is called for to improve the global climate for economic growth and job creation by evolving stable and supportive policies to regulate capital flows, foreign trade, debt, commodity pricing, immigration and labour movements, transfer of technology, investment, military spending and the arms trade.
 We set forth below a broad policy framework to stimulate global job growth with the aim of achieving full employment early in the twenty-first century.
 1.World Employment Programme: Raising incomes and creating jobs in the developing countries is the best way to promote global economic growth and employment generation in the coming decades.
 The World Summit on Social Development should call for a comprehensive World Employment Programme to stimulate more rapid growth in developing countries as an engine for global economic expansion.
 The International Labour Organization has operated a programme for the past two decades, but solution of the employment problem requires an integrated approach that transcends the scope of any single international agency.
 The programme should establish specific objectives and co ordinate efforts to stimulate international investment, increase labour market flexibility, promote productive skills, diffuse technology, eliminate protectionist trade policies that retard growth, increase trade between developing countries, and promote international cooperation on taxation systems to encourage more labour-oriented tax codes.
 2.Coordination of macro-economic policies: The efforts of the industrial nations to achieve higher rates of economic growth and job creation are stymied by the need to maintain macro-economic stability at the same time.
 Due to the competition between OECD members to attract financial resources, rising interest rates or falling inflation rates in one country influence the inflow and outflow of financial resources from other members of the community.

he problem identified here is inflation and the weakness of the South Pacific economic recovery92m.0m The effectiveness of monetary policy92m can0m help reduce92m inflation0m, but only in a South Pacific country. 3.Coordination of investments: Simple monetary policy can ensure healthy capital movements in certain industrial sectors and facilities.92m Long0m-term92m investment0m

The AElf maiden twisted her body against the guards and tried to meet Rodregas’ eyes and he realized that only she had the magical background to have realized what had happened.
 “Just two things, sir,” said Captain Poir in a hesitant voice.
 “Yes?” he asked trying to act calm and in control.
 “We might lose some guards and probably some of the kitchen drudges if they have money in hand and a whole week off, also we leave ourselves open for theft if we don’t keep at least a minimum of guards at the front gate.” Rodregas relaxed at the mundane nature of the questions.
 “True, but I will not stint in thanking the gods for a favorable ceremony.
 Keep a few guards at the gate, but only the minimum needed.
 But that does remind me.
 Release any remaining prisoners and make sure they are fed and clothed, and allow them to make their way back to their homes.” “That has some danger to it,” said Captain Poir hurriedly, his expression returning to a look of concern.
 “True,” he replied.
 “But do as I command,” Rodregas stated in his firmest voice.

I left a sleeping Rune just in time to find my sister sneaking from the castle.
 I followed her all the way to her secret spot.
 It took us half the day to get there, but it was worth it.
 It’s so far away from any kind of traffic, I have no idea how she even discovered it.
 Nestled in a patch of trees outside the forest was some sort of camp.
 I watched her at first.
 She scoured the area searching through the things she found there.
 But I couldn’t observe for long.
 I revealed myself and inquired about her previous finds and all the questions that were plaguing me.
 She was furious!

 He showed his guest out and then returned to kiss his daughter's cheek before sitting down behind his desk.

Asia is expected to generate half the growth in gross world product and world trade during the 1990s.
 This region will have one billion consumers of televisions, refrigerators and motor vehicles by the year 2000 and a rising appetite for both imported consumer and capital goods.
 East Asia alone, excluding Japan and China, will spend about $900 billion on infrastructure between 1992 and 2000.
 During this decade, China and India will add 21,000 megawatts of electricity generation every year and more telephone switching capacity than the United States and Japan combined.
 Latin America’s annual requirements for investment in power, water and sewage, telecommunications and transport infrastructure are estimated at $60 billion.
 Rising incomes and increasing exports to the dynamic economies of Asia and Latin America could generate as many as 1.7 million jobs by the end of the decade in the United States alone.
 The growth of the developing economies could provide the major impetus for economic expansion and job creation in both developed and developing countries.
 Government policies based on recognition of this fact can considerably improve the climate for development of these nations and correspondingly stimulate further growth in the West.
 Freer international trade will generate a flood of cheaper goods from the developing world that will give rise not only to greater purchasing power and higher standards of living for the Western consumer, but also to a ‘demand boom’ for sophis ticated Western goods and services to improve infrastructure and meet the needs of billions of consumers in developing countries.
 The vast inequalities in living standards that persist within both developing and industrial nations, and between the most and least economically developed countries, result in an enormous global loss of incomes and jobs.

You must do the same for Imeralda, for you two to be lovers you must learn to share her with others.

 Do not be so selfish as to want it all to yourself.” With that he gave a punch to Rodregas’ side, causing Rodregas to grunt in pain, and Doi’van followed the other two out the door.
 Rodregas laid in the bed, his mind whirling with thoughts.
 At first he thought about the implications of what Jordaan had shared.
 But, then his mind went back again and again over his and Imeralda’s time during the last few weeks and then back to Doi’van’s words.
 He knew his friend spoke the truth, but he was not so sure about his ability to do what he needed to keep his relationship with the beautiful AElven Nymph.
 CHAPTER 11 THE NATURE OF BONDS
 The next few days Rodregas and Doi’van recovered quickly under the powerful healing magic of Jordaan.

So while I admired this barmaid, who looked about three months pregnant, I dreamed she and I would roam until we discovered the right small town, where we didn’t know anybody.
 There she could leave behind the sorrow of getting ditched by the creep who knocked her up.
 I meant to love her baby like my own.
 But on the third evening, not long after she had sat with me and chatted in a dovelike voice about strange and outrageous visitors to the bar, a guy with several tattoos came for her.
 As she walked out with him, she waved goodbye to me.
 Earlier that day, I had noticed a Kitchen Help Wanted sign in a coffee shop.
 Since I hoped to become an instant father, in order to show the waitress my responsible side, I inquired about the job.
 The manager said, “Not your kind of work.” “Why not?” I asked, and explained that I had enjoyed last summer washing pots in a similar establishment.
 “The kitchen’s all colored help,” he said.
 “Fine with me,” I countered.

He must be very weak.
 “Easy there young man,” said the old Nymph.
 The Nymph slowly helped him up and held a bowl to his mouth.
 “My name is Durien and I am healer, please slowly drink this.
 Rinse your mouth out with it as your mouth is probably very dry after all this time.” The drink tasted like tea or maybe a light broth.
 As soon as Rodregas started to drink it, he realized he was starving.
 “I need more,” Rodregas croaked as he finished the bowl.
 The Nymph, an older man who unlike any Nymph Rodregas was familiar with, had his hair pulled back in a pony tail, nodded but said, “Slowly, too much right away is not good for you.” Rodregas nodded and cleared his throat; which was dry and felt like it had pebbles in it.
 While the bed was normal enough, the walls of the room were strange and seemed to be made of woven branches and some sort of hide or dark canvas pulled between tree branches to form an oval shape.
 “Doi’van and Imeralda, do they live?” he got the words out, though it hurt his throat to speak.

 He composed his face again, but she’d already marked him.
 “Oh, you like it.

 It might have pleased me too, except that I couldn’t tell if it was less how I had changed and more the resemblance to my mother.
 Ruby offered Chevelle a drink and he sat in a chair beside mine.
 She prattled as she enjoyed the wine, and I tried to focus on her stories instead of the occasional glances he threw my way.
 And then he grabbed my arm.
 I flinched, afraid at the quickness and strength of the move, but he only trailed an index finger gently down my arm, over the design, to stop in the center of my palm.

As it was, I quickly realized my little walk home was going to be twice as unpleasant as I'd expected.
 The school most definitely wasn't in the pretty, green part of the region.
 Every step kicked up a miniature cloud of fine, red dust that drifted into my lungs and slowly coated my clothes.
 The dust would've been plenty bad all by itself, but the heat made things even worse.
 It was only an hour or two removed from the hottest part of the day, and the air was so dry it sucked moisture out of me with each breath.
 I knew it was stupid to walk home.
 My one little bottle of water wasn't going to last me five miles in this oven, but I was tired of always having to be sensible about everything.
 I was going to walk, and that was it.
 Maybe if I passed out on the side of the road and ended up in the hospital Britney would finally realize what a wench she was.
 I was barely out of sight of the school, still vividly imagining Alec and Britney's faces when they found out that they'd put me in the hospital, when I heard a car approaching from behind me.
