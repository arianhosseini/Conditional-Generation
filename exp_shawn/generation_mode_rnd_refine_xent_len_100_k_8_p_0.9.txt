He would have to escape the town, regardless of the patrols that swarmed the area.
 He waited until nightfall.
 Even in the dark the elves still patrolled, carrying no torches for their keen eyes had no trouble seeing in the starlight.
 The longer he hid and watched, the more Qurrah was convinced they searched for him.
 The Neldaren troops were long gone, Harruq with them.
 He knew he was being paranoid, but the only other person they could be searching for was Velixar, and the elves were deluding themselves if they thought they could handle him.
 When a smaller patrol turned a corner and vanished, he opened the door, winked at the bloody corpse near the window, and then slipped into the night.
 The scent of mourning floated throughout the town, and he paused to enjoy the bittersweet strands of death that tugged on his heart.
 So many souls lost in battle, and even in the quiet aftermath, it was intoxicating.
 ‚ÄúNo sleep tonight,‚Äù he said, turning back to the building that had been his shelter.

Captain Poir led the man into the pale green circle that was the closest to being in the exact middle and was most strongly interconnected to the other circles.
 As Rodregas crossed into the main circle, the sense of power almost made him stumble.
 He knew his own power was minimal, not much above average, but his few years of training as a boy had opened him up to magic more than the other three guards on the tower roof.
 Rodregas knew that if Ravenhurr had ever thought he had more than basic magic training he would long have been reassigned to a duty far from the ceremony.
 The very air seemed to strum like a stringed instrument with the gathered magical power.
 Rodregas could not help but think about how out of his depth he was trying to interfere with the ritual ceremony.
 However, as he forced the beautiful woman forward, the woman whose name he had refused to learn, he knew he was indeed going to try.
 ‚ÄúI will do it this time,‚Äù Rodregas thought to himself, ‚ÄúThis time I will not choose my survival over others.‚Äù His life was not worth living if he did nothing again; he wanted to feel at least a small measure of being the man he had been raised to be.
 ‚ÄúCelestial Gods, please let my life be worth something in death, if not in life,‚Äù he prayed quietly.
 Captain Poir and Rodregas carefully put the two prisoners in the middle of their circles, and then stepped out.

It was a sudden and violent and primal process.
 The lion started to stand up and then simply fell apart into blazing blue energy.
 That energy surged out of the circle and swirled around inside the larger outer circle.
 Every hair on Rodregas‚Äô body stood at attention.
 Then the blue flaming energy was sucked into the pale green circle.
 There the prisoner, now empty of his own essence, stood still.
 As the blue fire was sucked into his body, the corporal body suddenly seemed more solid than before.
 Once more Ravenhurr yelled out in his melodious voice the trigger words for the next part of the ritual, ‚ÄúMana faria podia ricoria.‚Äù It was now or never for Rodregas to strike.
 Rodregas raised his arm up and threw his club forward with all his strength.
 There was no time to see if his club hit Junnit or if the half AElfin maiden ran.

Sworn to the All-Father.‚Äù Such an oath could not be challenged here.
 ‚ÄúTruly?‚Äù the sorcerer said.
 ‚ÄúThe Great Oath of Fealty for one of Infernal birth?
 I would see that.‚Äù He turned to Doi‚Äôvan who loomed over all of them.
 Doi‚Äôvan had watched the show with a cold interest.
 The sorcerer spoke with a command that dripped venom, ‚ÄúOn your knees Hellborn and swear the oath of fealty, in the name of the All-Father to this squire where we can all see.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan paused for a heartbeat and then pulled his sword out in a smooth gesture and for a moment Rodregas was thinking that a battle was to be had, but then Doi‚Äôvan dropped to his knees in front of Rodregas.
 He took the sword onto his arms as if in morning sword meditation and spoke the words of the Oath.
 ‚ÄúBy my mortal blood and sweat and tears do I swear my fealty to the Squire Rodregas in the name of the Father of Ocean, Sky and Earth.‚Äù Rodregas nodded and responded as was required, ‚ÄúAs the All-Father protects and guards his people so do I swear to do my best to live up to your oath in the Name of the All-Father.‚Äù Rodregas reached down and picked up the sword across Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs arms and lifted it up.
 ‚ÄúAs I lift your sword up, so do I lift up your honor and make it mine.‚Äù As he finished the oath he handed the sword back to Doi‚Äôvan, who responded with the final, ‚ÄúMy arm shall be your arm, my sword your sword, my honor your honor.‚Äù Rodregas had expected to have to claim his followers as Oath Bond, but a knight would never have demanded to see the oath.
 He felt guilt seize his stomach at having been mistaken and knowing Doi‚Äôvan had been forced to swear the oath, due to not wanting to blow their cover.

I didn‚Äôt clue her in.
 After a little more time there, I acted as if I‚Äôd lost interest and headed home.
 Tomorrow, I will follow the tracks.
 I will find whoever was there and solve the mystery of their rudimentary tools and strange huts.
 I yawned.
 After a quick glance around, I slid the book back into my pack.
 I rolled over and fell asleep listening to Ruby‚Äôs quiet tune.
 The next morning, the group seemed in unusually high spirits.
 I had no idea why the mood had shifted, but I enjoyed the laughter and joking anyway.
 We rode past a waterfall, the roar of water making me curious.

Together with Russia and Brazil, they could account for a larger portion of world GDP than today‚Äôs six largest industrialized nations.
 Population, which was perceived as a liability not long ago, now appears to be an asset.
 In reality, population, like nuclear energy and so many other things, is neutral.
 Its value depends on what we human beings make of it.
 Changing Demographic Profile of the West: Demographic studies indicate that steep declines in the growth of population in Europe, Japan and USA will create acute labour shortages and unprecedented long-term demand for migration of foreign workers or transplantation of work to developing countries.
 UN and other studies estimate that Europe would have to accept 150 million new immigrants over the next 25 years in order to maintain the present levels of working population and Japan would need to admit 600,000 immigrants annually for the next 50 years in order to maintain the size of its working population at the 1995 level.
 The US labour force is projected to stop growing by 2013.
 These findings support the view of the India Vision 2020 report that ‚ÄúThis trend will further accelerate the outsourcing of production of goods and services to locations where infrastructure, ease of doing business, quality, costs and availability of labour are most attractive, which will be beneficial for many labour surplus countries like India.‚Äù
 Expanding World Trade: Trade is playing an increasing role in the economic growth of developing countries.
 Economic integration with the global economy has become a compelling necessity for every country.

A modest investment in new institutions to disseminate information can have an impact comparable to that of the information superhighways being heralded in the most industrially advanced nations ‚Äì accelerating adoption of new activities, magnifying response to government programmes, and doubling the total developmental achievements of a country over the next five years.
 Information as a stimulus to transition
 The people of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are highly educated, but long deprived of free access to information.
 Recent economic reforms have dramatically increased the importance of information in the functioning of the economy.
 The breakdown of the command system necessitates the establishment of new channels for the dissemination of information about economic principles, commercial opportunities and successful practices within and outside the country.
 The macro-economic reforms introduced to free prices and legalize private property cannot generate the desired results, unless the population is also given easy access and exposure to a very wide range of essential in formation on new technologies, legal re forms, trade potentials, self-employment opportunities and modern management practices.
 The plethora of new laws, regulations and deregulations being enacted in these countries have left the population baffled and bewildered regarding what is now legal or illegal, acceptable or not permissible.
 The transition of these nations can be significantly accelerated by systematic dissemination of important information to the population regarding potentials in agriculture, industry, technology, commerce, management and law, as well as in politics, public administration, international relations, education, social institutions and health.
 Information needs of industrial nations
 Even in the information-rich West, where the average citizen is over whelmed by a continuous barrage of ideas, opinions and so-called ‚Äòfacts‚Äô of varying accuracy and credibility from myriad sources, there is a need for more reliable information.

I stammered out a thanks as Donovan released my hand.
 The rest of Alec's friends were already disappearing, Isaac and Jessica around back towards the garden, while James and Dominic were already inside his car, and backing down the lane.
 Alec took my hand as Donovan opened the front door for us.
 He walked with a definite limp, one that was all the more painful when contrasted against his otherwise graceful movements.
 I looked questioningly at Alec, but he shook his head, so I stayed quiet as he led me into the house.
 Rachel was waiting for us in a luxuriously-furnished sitting room.
 "Mother's been asking for you, Alec.
 I told her you'd be back soon, but she's worried."
 "I suppose this is a good opportunity to introduce Adriana."
 For the first time since I'd found out about Alec's secret, Rachel was looking uncertain.

But he couldn't regret that decision.
 She'd probably let him make love to her, but she'd be devastated when it was over.
 Her morals were deeply ingrained, and the guilt would eat away at her.
 He loved her far too much to put her through that.
 But they couldn't go on like this.
 He'd always prided himself on his self-control, but living under the same roof with a woman he loved, a woman who begged for his kisses--that was too much.
 But he knew Marie didn't really understand.
 She thought that they could just kiss forever.
 If only he could convince her to stay here with him.
 He was sure that she'd eventually come to accept the fact that she wasn't going to be able to get back home, but he was afraid they'd end up making love before she'd reached that point.

‚ÄúImeralda says that you are almost as powerful as me as a magician.
 If we found a way, would you like to take on some of the power of the sigils?‚Äù he asked.
 Rodregas had expected an immediate response, but instead his question was followed by a long pause before Doi‚Äôvan answered.
 Rodregas had learned that Doi‚Äôvan thought before speaking.
 ‚ÄúI am not sure.
 I like learning magic, though I am just beginning.
 I would think that I would take on a minor sigil or two.
 I am a great warrior, but I like to learn new things and I would like to have sufficient magic to be able to learn spells.‚Äù Rodregas nodded.
 Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs response would have surprised him before, but he had learned much of the thoughtful Hellborn in their time together.
 When one looked at him and how powerfully built he was, it was incredible to imagine what he could do on the battlefield with a greater sigil added to his power.

Sometimes no matter what a person does as a parent, children may travel to dangerous places.
 Some will return from those places unharmed and some may never return.
 A family can look perfect from the outside but be quite the opposite on the inside.
 I have lived such a life.
 I do not know what made me do what I did for my son but I can only surmise that it was a combination of all of the defining moments in my life that lead me to where I am today.

Surely she couldn't have come very far.
 Panicking, she began to run.
 A woman was coming out of one house, wearing very short blue trousers, and Marie ran in the other direction.
 She had to find Rick's house!
 Being stuck in the future was bad enough, but if she couldn't find Rick again, she'd-- "Marie!"
 She turned toward his voice.
 "Rick?"
 "Where are you?"
 "Here!

My wandering path brought me around to where I could see what I'd mentally dubbed 'Alec's corner'.
 It was a good thing there was an empty chair nearby.
 The force of Jasmin's stare was almost a palpable thing; my knees got weak so quickly it was like she'd reached out and pushed me.
 I steadied myself and then tried to ignore the way my skin crawled as I crossed the rest of the distance to Brandon's table.
 "The mongrels unnerve you a bit?"
 The scorn on the face that the comment belonged to was unnerving.
 I'd seen him several times before, but didn't have a name to go with his aristocratic features.
 "That's enough, Vincent."
 A trace of rebelliousness flared up at Brandon's chastisement, but Vincent buried it so quickly I almost didn't have enough time to classify it before it disappeared.
 Interestingly enough, I could see Cassie out of the corner of my eye, and she didn't look any happier than Vincent.

None of you have argued with Alec about anything since then, but Friday night James, Jasmin and Jessica were all ready to rip my head off over his express orders."
 The nod I received this time was even slower than the first.
 I waited for Isaac to say something, but he seemed unwilling to give away anything I hadn't already figured out for myself.
 "Can he win?
 Alec, I mean.
 Can he ki...beat Brandon?"
 Isaac's sigh was eloquent.
 "I'm forbidden to speak on these things.
 To do so risks no small amount of Alec's displeasure."
 "But you're going to anyways, aren't you?"

Together, these factors precipitated a rapid fall in farm production and food availability.
 There can be no solution to the food problem without first establishing a stable medium of exchange.
 5.Macro-level policy must be complemented by micro-level change: Putting in place the right macro-level policies may be necessary, but it is far from sufficient to create a functioning market.
 The governments of the region have been so preoccupied with ‚Äòre-engineering‚Äô their economic and political systems and with meeting the conditions to attract foreign aid and investment that they have tended to over look the many essential and practical steps needed to implement the reforms on the ground.
 Even if governments had been able to get all the laws and economic policies ‚Äòright‚Äô the first time, there is no assurance that the actual impact on the people would have been less harsh than it has been.
 The so-called ‚Äòshock therapy‚Äô strategy pursued by these countries has been widely criticized for its severity and seeming indifference to social costs.
 But debates regarding the appropriate speed and social cost of reforms divert attention from a more fundamental problem with this approach.
 The essence of shock therapy is a reliance on macro-economic factors to bring about a radical restructuring of the economy and a radical change in the behaviour of individuals and enterprises.
 While monetary policy may prove useful for dealing with short-term adjustment problems within a relatively stable environment, there is no evidence to support its use as the principle instrument for social transition.
 Monetary variables are indicators of the functioning of an economy, but the essential factors which determine the strength and health of an economy are the productivity of its enterprises and its workforce and the material resources of the country.

We'd been driving in more or less comfortable silence for several minutes before I decided to act before things got uncomfortable.
 "So, tell me about yourself."
 "There isn't much to tell.
 I was born here, and I'll probably die here."
 "More of the obligations you were talking about?"
 Brandon nodded, staring off in the distance for a second.
 "Yeah.
 It sounds pretentious, but a lot of people depend on my family.
 Half the businesses in the town are owned by my family, the other half are owned by Alec's mother."
 The revelation was a bit of a shock.

He charged the next closest squire who was approaching another squire.
 His new opponent never knew he was coming.
 He was heavily covered in armor with little visibility so he never saw Rodregas jumping on him from behind.
 This opponent was smaller and crashed to the ground at the unexpected weight of the attack.
 Rodregas was more careful in ripping off this squire‚Äôs helm, and punched him in the face but once.
 It was enough.
 He took out four other squires before anyone seemed to realize that he had changed the rules.
 Not to his surprise, it was Geriodon who was the first to face him and fend him off.
 Rodregas almost ran face into the squire‚Äôs mace, only throwing himself down barely in time to miss the blow.
 Rodregas knew that if this was going to work he had to keep up the momentum.

Not long ago, Mark did a tour as an Army psychologist in Iraq.
 Jaime recently earned a Master of Arts degree from Perelandra College, which Pam and I founded about eight years ago, and which I essentially run.
 The college is one of the occupations that keeps me rushing around, the condition that originally clued me I should read Brother Lawrence.
 Pam and I believed God was asking us to found the college to make a place for people in general and Christians in particular who wanted to become writers to discover what they honestly believe, and to write with courage from their unique visions.
 Thinking of Jaime, I can‚Äôt begin to lament the virtually endless hurdles we've been called upon to jump in order to earn and maintain the college‚Äôs licensing, accreditation and the rest.
 Jaime's thesis is superb.
 A novella about a young woman whose Christian parents, when their daughter finds herself in extreme trouble, appear more concerned with remaining in accord with their church than with helping or even trying to understand their daughter.
 Its honesty touches my heart.
 Jaime and I spend a day roaming the city, with an hour stop at the Seattle Mystery Bookstore, which played a role in the final scene of Road Kill, an account of a book tour my friend Alan and I did together.
 At several of the tour stops, including Seattle and Portland, Mike Connelly joined us.

She knows most everything about nutrition and raising kids.
 Before Cliff and I go out to slug golf balls into the trees, Toni and I talk in the kitchen.
 After a wandering conversation about food, kids and baseball somehow leads to spiritual matters, Toni mentions that she has always supposed people turn to God for comfort.
 What I don‚Äôt know about people in general could probably fill all the world‚Äôs libraries.
 But I can offer that I have turned to God at various times for a variety of reasons.
 In hopes of gaining understanding.
 To lessen my likelihood of hurting people.
 Out of fear.
 On account of worries about my kids.
 Out of gratitude.

 "Please don't try and take the blame for this.
 We've been on a collision course with Brandon's pack for years."
 His touch was intoxicating.
 I could feel warm tingles start from my shoulders and work their way down my arms.
 A full two seconds of silence passed before I realized he'd asked me why I'd come downstairs.
 "I can't sleep.
 I've been trying, but I'm too wound up to do anything but just lie there.
 I thought I'd come downstairs and talk to you instead.
 I mean, unless it's bothering you.

But they were also the happiest of people, which I couldn‚Äôt make sense of, until one afternoon when a mob of locals came to pick up groceries.
 These folks lived in a shantytown on the bank of an oily swamp I call the Black Lagoon.
 The neighborhood is so poor that when my cousin and I delivered a rusted tool shed to one of the families, they used it as a granny flat.
 I was helping the Brothers pass out vegetables when I got blessed with a feeling so profound, the recollection of it still uplifts me.
 These people I was helping, though not on my own but as a paid reporter, were blessing me.
 Like Curly did at Chapters Books.
 And like Mother Teresa blessed me.
 One Saturday a few years back, my friend Diane called.
 As a lay Missionary of Charity, she knew, and whispered to me, that Mother was around, visiting the MC houses in Tijuana and San Diego, in secret like she did, since she preferred not to get mobbed.
 The MCs rise early.

It was an accident.
 A product of her temper, her human emotions.
 They were testing her, a servant told me.
 Anvil was holding her back, Rune with magic.
 She snapped and they saw her power.
 Some denied the possibility but not my father.
 He has attained his prize, that which he has always coveted.
 I will stop him.
 ~ The plan is forming, but I am unsure whether it will work.
 I know I cannot defeat him, and his guard, alone.

Hey, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll call you, toad dwarfs.‚Äù I smiled at my quick thinking.
 I could be clever sometimes.
 Take that Seth.
 ‚ÄúSilly girl, we‚Äôre already called toad dwarfs.‚Äù The one on my leg croaked.
 ‚ÄúAw darn, never mind then.‚Äù So much for being clever.
 The one on my back grabbed my hair.
 He yanked it back.
 ‚ÄúOw!
 It may be green but I still value it!‚Äù I grumbled, trying to pull my head free.
 I also had no desire to be bald at 16.

You admitted yourself that you don't know anything about us.
 It was a mistake for me to let you get involved.
 I'm going to remedy that right now.
 We'll get you home, and then your mom is going to get an offer that's too good to pass up.
 With any luck you'll both be out of town within a couple days.
 I think I can arrange it so neither of you will be back for a year or two.
 That should be more than enough time for this all to resolve itself one way or another."
 I felt my eyes go wide with panic as I realized what he was proposing.
 "Wait.
 No.

I will write about reading Brother Lawrence and this trip before the next novel or anything else gets in my way.
 And by the end, I vow, I will know better how to adore God.
 Which, for reasons I‚Äôll soon learn, turns me once again to thoughts of Eric.
 After a mile or so I‚Äôm questioning whether, on that Sunday as he walked over the hill between Sylvia's house and Kenny Niedermeyer's, Eric got handed the choice to save me and/or Billy, or to save himself.
 The only answer I receive is a maybe.
 But all I need is to recognize the long shot possibility that the dearest person I have known gave his life for me and, despite the sorrow, my heart leaps with adoration.
 For a moment on Highway 101 in Pismo Beach, I feel sure that Eric was Jesus.
 Not in full, as in a Second Coming.
 But in a way so that Jesus entered him and took possession.
 While this thought grips me, both Eric and Jesus become so precious the word adore feels timid and weak.

‚ÄúTake him,‚Äù she said.
 A bolt of lightning hit his shield, numbing his arm and knocking him back.
 The shield slumped low, but he charged anyway, fully willing to die fighting.
 ‚ÄúFor Neldar,‚Äù he cried, thrusting at Aurelia‚Äôs chest.
 Felewen was there first.
 All it took was three cuts.
 The first took the man‚Äôs sword from his hand.
 The second took his arm from his body.
 The third took his life.
 A final bolt of lightning shot down the street, killing the wounded soldier who had fled.

"No.
 Traveling by plane is really safe, sweetheart.
 Far fewer people are killed in plane crashes than in car crashes."
 She sat back when she felt the airplane pick up speed.
 She was looking out the window, so she both saw and felt the plane leave the ground.
 "We're in the air!"
 she gasped.
 "Just wait until we're above the clouds.
 They look like a bed of cotton."
 She was quiet until they were flying through the clouds.

 Harruq kicked open the barricaded door and then barged up the stairs.
 Qurrah withdrew a few pieces of bone from a pouch.
 He tightened his grip about them, whispering a few words of magic as he did.
 Then he looked to the window.
 He could barely see a bow and part of a hand.
 Qurrah waited.
 The Neldaren warriors charged, hoping to overwhelm their opponents before arrows took them all.
 The elf in the window leaned out to unleash a killing strike, but it was Qurrah who did the killing.
 Four pieces of bone leapt from his hand.

I all but skipped out of the classroom.
 Later I'd probably complain about how small it was and wish I had enough to go shoe shopping, but for now it was just nice to know I had some discretionary money.
 Brandon looked up as I walked into the cafeteria, and waved me over.
 As I threaded between a pair of closely-set tables I noticed that Alec's table seemed unusually unsettled.
 If a shouting match could be conducted in whispers, it was being done by Jasmin and James, neither of who looked like they were happy about whatever was being discussed.
 Alec wasn't talking, but from the way he was scanning the room, he didn't want to be there anymore than the rest of them.
 I made it to Brandon's table, and was still pulling my meal replacement drink out of my bag when the loudspeaker clicked on with the obligatory burst of static.
 "This is Principal Gossil and I've got an exciting announcement.
 The school is sponsoring a trip to Las Vegas to see the production of Les Mis√©rables that just started.
 Tickets are available at a discounted rate in the office for the next two days."

‚ÄúIt seems there was some trouble in town today,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúThe elders are in an uproar.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt question any further.
 Town trouble was usually of no interest to me.
 Actually, I couldn‚Äôt think of the last time the town had had trouble‚Ä¶ She huffed and I knew it was best to indulge her.
 ‚ÄúWhat sort of trouble?‚Äù ‚ÄúApparently, Evelyn of Rothegarr came into town from the meadows at full speed wheezing and sneezing.
 She reached the village center, grabbed her throat, and fell to the ground without a breath.
 Dying.‚Äù I stopped chewing, my mouth gone dry.
 Fannie continued, ‚ÄúThey found a common thistle caught in her airway.‚Äù My stomach curled into knots.
 I whispered, ‚ÄúA thistle?‚Äù ‚ÄúMmm.
 Council thinks she must have been working a spell that went awry.‚Äù Fannie peered at me; I might have turned pale.

Then he rolled up the window, started the car, and droved away.
 I slept on Jill‚Äôs couch.
 In the morning I walked to a donut shop.
 It had a service window opening onto the sidewalk.
 A trio of boys about my age stood waiting their turn.
 But when they saw me, they jumped aside.
 That whole summer, I struck terror into many hearts on account of I had backed down two of Pacific Beach‚Äôs toughest.
 At parties and the beach, girls who got upset and spiteful toward their boyfriends would appear at my side in hopes the boyfriend would object and I would thrash him.
 At Carmen Ranch Club, Eric was on the trampoline, probably showing off for his friend Carol, when he soared too high and got distracted by something.
 He fell sideways, ricocheted off the rail and landed on asphalt.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwas your mother in a place of strong magic when she was pregnant with you?‚Äù He held his breath, worried that his question might be impolite.
 But Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs smile continued and he nodded, ‚ÄúYes, my mother is a princess of the Orqui clans of the Farisa across the inland sea.
 There the Orqui are torn between following the Celestials and the Daemon Lords of the Infernal Realm.
 My family is of the Orrghirrlida tribe that follows the Celestials.
 Of course, the Daemon Lords love to tempt all those of Celestial blood.
 I was born a bastard from an illicit affair of such a temptation.
 While the shape my father had taken had been fair, I came out, well let‚Äôs just say my paternity was not in question.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is an old game among my people,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan continued ‚Äúand while I suffered much in my own clan, they kept me in the palace and I grew to adulthood in its strong magical confines and to my full strength.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Imeralda broke in, ‚ÄúYou are of both Infernal and Celestial blood?‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan seemed hesitant to answer for a moment but after a long pause said, ‚ÄúYes, but most choose not to see it that way.
 You are either Hellborn or not.
 After I grew to manhood, I decided my true place was among one of the other clans, one that follows the lordship of the Hellborn.‚Äù He spoke this very slowly each deep rumble of his tone dragged out.
 ‚ÄúI was wrong though, and quickly realized that those who follow the Lords of the Infernal Realms were even a worse fit for me than at home, though they did see me as royal blood and not tainted.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan added, ‚ÄúI eventually decided to start somewhere new and took a ship across the inland sea.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan paused at this and shook his head, his hair flying wild, as he seemed to want to shake out a memory from his massive head before he continued.

That wasn't anything; it didn't mean anything.
 Please put me down."
 I tried to put the right amounts of sincerity and confidence in my words, but I wasn't a very good liar.
 Something changed though because Alec slowed his ground-eating stride.
 "What do you mean you're fine?
 People don't just collapse with no warning.
 You seemed fine and then you were falling.
 You s...you seemed hurt."
 I shook my head gingerly, surprised when I didn't feel the twinge I knew was coming.
 The attack had been more sudden than usual and nobody had been close enough to catch me.

Is he more than a man with an extraordinary gift?
 Is he really something holy?
 Of course not.
 He is just an exceptional artist, a poet, a singer of peculiar power and persuasion and grace.

 Is it right, just, meet?

When he opened them, most of the fog had evaporated.
 Everything seemed normal.
 The water was gurgling from the frog's mouth.
 Jumping up, he ran inside and up the stairs.
 "Marie?"
 he called, knocking on her door.
 "Sweetheart, I'm sorry.
 Please come out."
 Marie zipped and buttoned her shorts and looked at her hair in the mirror.
 Part of her wanted to stay mad at him, but she didn't want to waste a Sunday fighting.

 "I know you just broke up with Davis two days ago, but a family dinner--" "It has nothing to do with Davis.
 I just-I just want to be with my family for a while."
 The thought of being courted was revolting.
 Rick had said that they'd both eventually settle for someone else and get married, but she had no intention of marrying anyone else.
 She would never stop loving Rick.
 After breakfast Marie felt restless and agreed to her mother's suggestion that they go shopping.

Then she nodded thoughtfully and the four quickly agreed that they would share the sigil with anyone who were skilled, honorable and had no love for the Immortalist Guild.
 They returned to their rooms that night tired; they had tracked down twelve more squires.
 All had at least two ribbons; and all swore secrecy at the source of their sigil.
 The biggest surprise was probably Geriodon, who had beaten Rodregas earlier that day.
 Rodregas could not argue against sharing the minor sigil as he clearly fit the description of a worthy candidate.
 Geriodon was more than happy to swear that he had no love for the Guild and that Justice should be dealt to all equally.
 But before accepting the sigil he wanted to be sure that any Shadow Order he joined was mostly about secrecy to protect themselves, and that he would still be able to compete for true knighthood in the Order of the Soaring Heavens.
 Rodregas dropped into his cot tired and exhausted.
 Even with his healing sigil he had needed a full night‚Äôs rest, but duty did not wait for what a man needed.
 Imeralda woke him slightly after dawn, and Rodregas could tell that both she and Doi‚Äôvan had spent the few hours left of the night working on what was left of their equipment.

She set her glass down.
 "I don't want to be paired with anyone."
 "He loves going to the pictures, just like you do.
 And he has a very good job with--" "I don't care, John.
 I'm not interested in seeing anyone."
 "I know you just broke up with Davis two days ago, but a family dinner--" "It has nothing to do with Davis.
 I just-I just want to be with my family for a while."
 The thought of being courted was revolting.
 Rick had said that they'd both eventually settle for someone else and get married, but she had no intention of marrying anyone else.
 She would never stop loving Rick.

Chevelle remained standing where he was, his back to me.
 I had to decide.
 Walk within feet of him going to the library to research him or run home and hide.
 My stomach churned.
 It was ridiculous.
 I took a deep breath and kept walking, approaching the split.
 He turned to me, scarcely a few feet away.
 ‚ÄúGood morning.‚Äù He nodded as he spoke, his voice as smooth as velvet.
 I managed to snap my slack jaw shut at the same moment I realized I had angled my body toward him when he‚Äôd addressed me.
 I mentally cursed, but I could recover this; I would just keep going in the same direction as if I were on my way to town, because I was on my way to town.

‚ÄúWell, Harruq,‚Äù Alvrik said, slowly nodding his head.

 Harruq grinned ear to ear, even his nervousness unable to diminish his excitement.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be here before the rooster knows it‚Äôs dawn.‚Äù

 A sharp pain in his gut dragged Harruq from his dreams.
 He lifted open a single eye and glared at the blurry image of his brother.

Some of my fondest memories are of the days I got to watch him golf competitively.
 Such a fine young man and a great sport; win or lose, he shows class and dignity.
 Brandon eventually lost his interest in youth sports and had no interest in golf.
 He did, however, love hot rods.
 He was intrigued by my high school hot rod so we found the same make, model and year of car in horrible condition.
 The only positive comment Lisa could make was, ‚Äúat least it runs.‚Äù I taught both of my boys to drive a stick shift on this beat up Chevelle before my eldest and I began to take it completely apart in an attempt to restore this classic car to its original condition with a hot rod twist.
 The deeper we dug into it, the more rust and damage we found.
 There were so many holes rusted through the bottom we could see the garage floor through the trunk.
 We removed every wire, rubber seal, window felt, and had boxes full of zip-lock baggies that were marked with a Sharpie what the part was and where it had come from.
 When Brandon was about fifteen, we went to Hot August Nights in Reno, a huge hot rod auto show.

The funding requirements are within the range of current five-year projections: 84 per cent of additional planned investment in agriculture and 25 per cent of additional planned expenditure in industry.
 The average cost per additional job is less than $1,000, roughly one-tenth the average cost of jobs in India's private sector and one-hundredth the cost of new jobs in the public sector.
 Implementation of the strategy will require a substantial investment in training of both on-farm and industrial workers, but the plan is based on the recognition that enhancing the skills of the nation's rural work-force will take time and must be done incrementally.
 As the programme gains momentum and rural incomes rise, the demand for industrial products and services will grow, resulting in a shift to greater farm mechanization and gradual movement of more and more workers to non-farm employment.
 Organization is a crucial issue in a country of more than 90 million small farmers.
 The strategy envisions the establishment of several new types of organization to bring together small farmers for processing, marketing and distribution and to promote more active linkages between farmers and the private industrial sector, both Indian and foreign.
 In order to implement such a massive strategy within a ten-year period, government must play a central role as catalyst and pioneer, rather than owner or manager, to generate widespread public awareness about the technological and commercial opportunities, identify optimal and sustainable resource-based potentials for specific regions, facilitate the transfer and dissemination of technology, provide training and demonstration, invest in the techno-infrastructure needed for transport, storage and distribution, offer management education to rural enterprises, and promote the establishment of new organizations.
 The Prosperity 2000 strategy has been adopted by the Indian government and incorporated in India's Eighth Five Year Plan.
 A Small Farmer's Agri-Business Consortium, a specialized agency for implementation of the strategy, has been established by the government to coordinate implementation.
 In order to evolve a detailed methodology for implementation and to demonstrate the feasibility of the strategy model, district programmes are being organized in 12 districts around the country.

The growth of agricultural incomes in developing countries is critically important to global job creation and economic growth.
 The expansion of agricultural exports under the new GATT agreement is likely to exacerbate the falling commodity price syndrome to the great detriment of the entire world economy, unless effective mechanisms are introduced to stabilize international commodity prices.
 Of the many efforts in the past, some were tried and failed, many were proposed but never implemented.
 The recent success of coffee-producing countries in lifting prices from a disastrously low level has been an exception to the rule.
 Collective and coordinated international action is essential to address this problem.
 Despite past failures, new efforts must be made to revive international commodity agreements, preferably covering both producing and consuming countries.
 This will be possible only if developing countries first arrive at a consensus approach among themselves, including the economic costs and benefits, and a financing plan.
 Financing for international commodity stocks could be supplied partly by producer countries in the form of building national stocks under collective supervision.
 Partly, it could come from bank commercial loans against commodity collateral, loans from regional development banks, the World Bank and IMF's Buffer Stock Facility, which has remained almost unused.

Nothing more of any of this.
 I didn‚Äôt know what I would do, but by the time I reached Chevelle, I knew what I wanted: to retrieve my mother‚Äôs things from the vault.
 I would leave this wretched place behind.
 I made my stance more formal to match his as I said, ‚ÄúI want to learn transfer magic.‚Äù His mouth tightened and he turned his head, a half shake.
 ‚ÄúYou taught me fire,‚Äù I argued.
 ‚ÄúFor protection, Freya.‚Äù ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I begged.
 He hesitated.
 I didn‚Äôt know how to convince him.
 Was it too soon for me to learn?
 I knew there was an order to the spells, knew you must earn the knowledge.

 I‚Äôll do my best by him.
 That is about all I can offer him.
 It‚Äôs all I could ever offer him, and it was never enough, your mother saw to that.
 I failed him as a father so far.
 We‚Äôve all failed him.
 The entire world, even God.
 It‚Äôs no real wonder why he‚Äôs so damn angry with us all.
 I just hope we can reach to him before he decides to get revenge on life for the lot he has been cast.
 I don‚Äôt know how I would try to reach him in your place.

CHAPTER 5 A PLACE OF PRIDE
 Rodregas drove the wagon with Imeralda sitting next to him; Doi‚Äôvan continued his impressive show of endurance by actually jogging next to the wagon and showing no trouble keeping up.
 As the trail was more of a hunting path than a proper road and they were traveling on an upward incline, the wagon was struggling to make much time.
 It was not until their midday stop that the three had any real conversation.
 ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù asked Imeralda, ‚Äúwhere are we going?
 I assume it is not the Northern Kingdoms as you said to Audrian.
 For one thing that would be stupid, and for a second you seem to be climbing ever higher into the Arida Mountains and that is hardly the best way north.‚Äù Rodregas nodded.
 He hoped to make it to his hideaway by nightfall, so he decided it did not hurt to share his plan at this point.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right; we are not going to the Northern Kingdoms.
 A few companions and I were hiding out in the Aridas and in one of the higher hollows I found an old farmhouse.

And then my hands found their way to my stomach and rested there.
 I drew in a sharp intake of breath.
 I hadn‚Äôt noticed I had gotten so deeply involved in the story.
 I needed to rest, to finish my recovery and break the bonds.
 But I couldn‚Äôt seem to step away.
 I was unnaturally calm when they finally came for me.
 I knew they would recognize the signs.
 But it didn‚Äôt matter now.
 I walked forward, resigned to my fate.
 What I didn‚Äôt expect was their response.

A permanent, well equipped UN force made up from 20‚Äì30 member states should be placed at the disposal of the Secretary General for rapid deployment in conflict zones under Article 43 of the UN Charter to enforce the decisions of the Security Council.
 Either the Military Staff Committee of the UN could be revitalized to give strategic direction to any enforcement action, or a new structure should be created of member states supplying troops to any UN operation, chaired by the Secretary General.
 Member States should earmark national troops for use in UN Chapter VII enforcement action, the scope of which should be expanded to include humanitarian intervention under circumstances when national governments are either unable or unwilling to protect their populations from imminent threats to their survival.
 6.A cooperative collective security frame work must be evolved that is inclusive of all nations and guarantees their security against acts of external aggression.
 A standing international military force or World Army should be established under a democratic framework to provide unconditional security guarantees to member countries against aggression by other nations.
 If such a force cannot be established at the present time under the UN, then there is need for a separate organization similar in constitution to NATO but open to all nations that practise democratic principles of national governance, contribute financial and defence resources to a common armed force, accept ceilings on national defence expenditure and eschew the possession of nuclear weapons.
 The army should consist of both a directly recruited standing force and forces placed on call by member nations.
 7.The use of nuclear weapons should be declared by the UN a crime against humanity.
 First use by any nation must automatically invoke the strongest collective security measures by the UN Security Council.
 Based on the precedent of the Chemical Weapons Treaty, the proposal for a universal ban on the possession of nuclear weapons by any nation should be placed before the Security Council for a vote.

I could always judge how long I'd been out by my mom's expression when I came to.
 That and whether or not I'd seriously injured myself on the way down.
 She looked concerned, but not desperate yet.
 Her cell phone was in her hand, but not yet flipped open.
 It probably hadn't been more than eight or nine minutes.
 "Adri, what just happened?"
 She knew already, the psychiatrist had some fancy name for it complete with a whole list of symptoms and psychobabble garbage.
 It all boiled down to the idea that the more Mom could get me to talk about it, the sooner I'd shake off the fainting spells.
 Yeah right.
 Talking didn't make anything better; it just let him rack up a bunch of fees while I was passed out on his couch.

When we finish with them I will never fit in that armor.‚Äù Rodregas smiled at the disgust in the Hellborn‚Äôs tone and the confidence that it implied.
 ‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù Rodregas replied, ‚Äúbut it is pretty.
 And I would love to be facing them with one of those blue steel swords.‚Äù ‚ÄúNow don‚Äôt go lowering your standards, blue steel and night bronze?
 Good enough for the common soldier, but I fancy something a little more distinctive.‚Äù Rodregas was about to ask him what he had in mind when they found out why they had been waiting; two more slavers came up with drawn bows.
 They were going to take them from a safe distance.
 Doi‚Äôvan and he needed no words; they both knew only instant action gave them a chance.
 Rodregas would like to have tried to take on one of the Immortal Guards, but he had already noticed that the slaver with the mace was a little too close and a little too far away from his nearest companion.
 He was a skinny man with dirty hair and seemed to be having trouble holding his heavy weapon.
 Rodregas stepped in close and the slaver swung the mace with surprising force, but he met it with the shield and knocked it aside.
 Rodregas moved with simply too much speed to be blocked.

Left to itself, unemployment may continue to deprive large numbers of people in these countries from enjoying basic economic rights, unless concerted steps are taken to remove the perceptual and structural barriers to full employment.
 While data on unemployment levels in most developing countries is of doubtful accuracy and recent data are difficult to obtain, there is no question that the problem remains severe, especially among youth and the educated.
 ILO estimated that at the end of 2000 approximately 110 million workers in developing countries, excluding Central and Eastern Europe, were unemployed, most of them first-time jobseekers.
 Unemployment rates among young workers are almost everywhere at least twice as high as the average.
 In addition another 500 million workers in the developing world earned less than a dollar a day.
 Although the growth rate of the world's labour force is slowing down, approximately 460 million additional jobseekers will enter the global labour force between 2000 and 2010, two-thirds in Asia.
 ILO has concluded that the prospects for an improving global employment situation depend mainly on continued expansion of the world economy.
 While that expansion is likely, economic growth alone will not be sufficient to provide opportunities for sustainable livelihood for all those who need it.
 Jobs or livelihood for all must be the bottom line of all development, technological and trade policies.
 It will be necessary for governments to elevate employment to the top of their policy agenda and dedicate themselves to the vital task of achieving full employment.

Instead they were dodging away to avoid being run over.
 I felt the fine hair on the back of my neck stand on end, but was distracted by Alec's return before I could figure out what else had changed about Brandon.
 Jasmin pulled Rachel to her feet, and gently pushed her towards Alec before casually taking a seat next to me.
 It was a careful act.
 I'd spent way too much time with the pack to believe any of them had failed to notice Brandon's entrance.
 My gaze wandered back to where Vincent and Cassie were arrogantly walking through the door.
 Where Brandon had chosen a fairly traditional black tux, Vincent had selected a silvery masterpiece that probably cost only half as much as the former's outfit, but which practically screamed for attention.
 Cassie trailed along half a step behind Vincent, in a gray evening gown that was equal parts material and skin.
 Backless and strapless, combined with some fairly daring cutouts.
 She could probably have made a run for royalty if she hadn't topped the dress off with a scowl.

We‚Äôre all sinners, he said, and we‚Äôre sinners by choice.
 We choose to break God's moral laws.
 We become drunkards or fornicators, selfish, consumed with pride and prejudice and intolerance.
 But the sinful heart can‚Äôt find happiness.
 And God, he assured us, wants his creatures to get happy, which is why Christ said we must be born again, so he could give us new moral natures, new affections, new objectives, and new directions.
 What planted the hook in me was: according to Billy Graham, when you make your decision for Christ, you do it for the sake of the nation and the world.
 Without God, any nation will perish.
 And a nation is only as strong as its people.
 A better world requires better nations of better people.
 Christ can make us into those people.

If even an inessential element or condition is missing, the process of transition may take much longer than would otherwise be necessary.
 Lack of information, lack of education, lack of necessary skills, lack of supportive laws or incentives or protection against losses ‚Äì insufficiency in any of these areas may be enough to slow or delay the process of change by years or even decades.
 The world needs a coherent intellectual framework for understanding and dealing with radical transitions.
 High priority should be given to developing a fresh conceptual approach that is not en cumbered by allegiance to existing theories and systems.
 Transitions should be regarded as social transformations which depend on and result in corresponding changes in the political, economic and other spheres.
 Efforts to guide a multi-dimensional social transition through uni-dimensional strategies, particularly those limited to manipulation of macro-economic policy, are unlikely to yield the anticipated results.
 Even those transitions which are apparently confined to economic activities within a stable political context necessarily depend on changes in social attitudes and in social institutions which can be dealt with most effectively by assuming a wider perspective of the process.
 Clear visualization of the before and after states of transition, the existing system, the goals to be sought after, and a detailed picture of the changes that need to occur in behaviour, attitudes and institutions are necessary for deriving the most effective transition strategies.
 With the knowledge the world possesses today, with the example of many successful nations over the last four decades, and with its highly educated and motivated people, surely the nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia can abridge the time required and the hardship of lessons learned by trial and error to a few years.
 But this cannot be accomplished by sweeping remedies or hastened by over-eagerness or impatience.

The rain had stopped, and the sun was rising, so I wiped the sweat from my brow and went to the hall pitcher to splash my face.
 The dark roots of my hair were stark in the mirror‚Äôs reflection, and I recalled the dream.
 The memories of my mother were fuzzy, but I‚Äôd always thought she‚Äôd had light hair, beautiful and golden like Junnie‚Äôs.
 In the dreams, it was black‚Ä¶ as black as the roots of my hair were now.
 I stood there for a long moment, staring at the darkness, and then spun as I made another stupid, rash decision.
 Slinking past Fannie‚Äôs room, I headed for her makeshift vault.
 She kept all the things I wasn‚Äôt allowed to touch in that room; it was supposed to be off limits.
 Not that I‚Äôd bothered trying much, because there was a large flat stone‚Äîcovering where it hid in the floor‚Äîthat I‚Äôd never been able to move.
 But that was before.
 I wasn‚Äôt sure how the magic had worked with the bird, but I knew it had, so I dropped to my knees, held my hands above the stone, and closed my eyes, concentrating with everything I had.

 Tonight they mourn.‚Äù He stood erect, stretching out his arms as if relishing the warmth of sunshine.
 ‚ÄúSuch wonderful dead.
 To die in combat is a glorious fate, Qurrah.
 Never forget it.
 The blessings of gods linger in those who fight and fall valiantly.‚Äù
 Qurrah nodded.

I didn‚Äôt have to be bound to not have magic.
 It wasn‚Äôt a novelty, it was everyday life.
 ‚ÄúWe should stop for breakfast,‚Äù Chevelle said.
 We hadn‚Äôt been riding long, but it wasn‚Äôt a suggestion.
 I didn‚Äôt mind; I‚Äôd eaten mostly berries for days and I wasn‚Äôt quite sure about riding yet.
 ‚ÄúI suppose you‚Äôre right.
 Might as well enjoy the journey,‚Äù Steed said, throwing me a private grin.
 We stopped under the canopy of a red oak and Steed grabbed me as I slid awkwardly from the horse.
 ‚ÄúYou may ask him to kneel, Elfreda.‚Äù Not that he appeared to mind handling me about the waist to help me down.
 Looking up at him, I pushed the hair away from my face.

On school days when the ocean beckoned, I might stop by the hospital at visiting hours, wash up and don a smock, spend a few minutes with my mom, and get her to sign absence slips.
 Eric didn‚Äôt need absence slips.
 If he returned to school after an absence and told the attendance clerk he‚Äôd been out with the one-day variety of bubonic plague, she would have excused him rather than phone his mother to verify.
 When anyone from the school called Sylvia, she might hold the person on the phone for an hour, ranting about their misdeeds.
 I have two pictures of Eric.
 His senior picture, given a full page in our senior-year annual, a head shot of keen blue eyes with thick lashes, freckles, and sandy hair, a chin square as Dick Tracy‚Äôs, an easy grin that would have wrongly convinced you he was loaded with confidence.
 And the one Sylvia called the ‚ÄúJesus body picture‚Äù a snapshot somebody took in the locker room.
 Eric in a jock strap, beaming, his legs and arms spread as though to greet a familiar angel.
 Eric was superman.
 Strong, handsome, understanding, considerate, creative, vital, and brilliant.

Something needed to change because my only hope of going to college was to get a scholarship, or load up on student loans, and I had no desire to graduate sixty thousand dollars in debt and spend the next fifteen years trying to pay it all off.
 By the time I met up with Britney in the hall I was emotionally exhausted and could feel an attack hovering in the wings.
 Much as I'd have liked to, I couldn't continue to blow her off.
 She was my only friend, and I definitely didn't want her spreading the kind of rumors about me that she routinely spread about everyone else.
 "Wow, you look like crap.
 Are you going to collapse like you did last night?"
 "Thanks, Brit.
 You look ravishing too, and no, I'm not going to collapse.
 I just haven't been sleeping very well lately.
 I'm probably coming down with something."

Raising her head, she leaned a little closer to him.
 He was asleep!
 She lay there for a few more minutes, but she was too restless to keep lying still, especially with no one to talk to.
 So at last she jumped up and ran into the waves.
 Rick woke up slowly with no idea of how long he'd been asleep.
 It had been an exhausting week, and he'd gotten less sleep than usual.
 Of course, he'd had much more fun than usual too, he thought with a lazy smile.
 He turned to see if Marie was asleep.
 She wasn't there!
 Springing to his feet, he looked around.

"This evening has been like a fairy tale.
 Even if we left tomorrow, I'd be happy."
 "Good."
 He stroked her cheek with one finger.
 "That's all I want."
 Her heart began pounding when she realized he was going to kiss her goodnight.
 His lips were light, almost teasing, as they touched hers.
 When he raised his head, she couldn't look away from him.
 Rick smiled at her somewhat dazed expression.
 "Sleep well, sweetheart."

‚ÄúOkay, okay,‚Äù I shouted.
 ‚ÄúLet me up.‚Äù Chevelle‚Äôs camouflage dissipated and he stared down at me, disappointed.
 I smirked.
 ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your horse?‚Äù He smiled as the beast nipped at the back of my head, yanking my hair.
 Grumbling, I swatted the horse away and ran my hand over my face, sure it was mottled with bruises and scratch marks.
 ‚ÄúDrink this.‚Äù Chevelle offered me a hide flagon and I took it, swallowing a mouthful before the taste hit me.
 ‚ÄúGah, that tastes like cat pee smells.‚Äù Chevelle chuckled.
 ‚ÄúIt will help with the healing.‚Äù Why bother?
 I wondered.
 It would be another day of bombardment with mountain fixtures‚Ä¶ maybe whole trees this time.

A swelling of nerves in his gut almost forced him to leave.
 Several men in front of him turned away, dejected or angry.
 He didn‚Äôt hear the reasons why and didn‚Äôt want to know.
 The idea of so much money, more than enough to buy warm food and clean drink, kept him there.
 At last it was his turn, and he approached the table where Alvrik sat chewing on a piece of bone long since void of meat.
 ‚ÄúYou,‚Äù he said before Harruq could mutter a word.

Many cases of ethnic conflict have an under lying basis of economic deprivation that must be addressed before tensions will permanently subside.
 Others can be mitigated by the introduction of positive economic incentives for cooperation.
 Economic cooperation is already dissipating ethnic tensions and conflict in the Middle East.
 It can be creatively fostered in the Balkans and elsewhere.
 In other cases, the modification of the electoral and constitutional systems in a culturally appropriate manner can reduce or eliminate tensions in ethnically divided countries.
 International assistance is also needed for coping with tensions arising from the sharing of natural resources ‚Äì particularly water resources ‚Äì and chemical or radioactive pollution of air, soil and waterways.
 Resolution of these issues requires the mediation of international experts for impartial assessment and formulation of equitable recommendations.
 Regional security organizations can play a leading role in this capacity.
 An effective international judicial system is vitally important to the expanded role contemplated for the UN in dealing with arms and drugs trafficking, terrorism and crimes against humanity.
 This requires, as a minimum step, either that the International Court of Justice be granted mandatory jurisdiction over such cases by member states, or that an International Criminal Court be established with jurisdiction over these offences and other crimes under international law, thus strengthening both the preventive and enforcement capabilities of the international community against non-traditional threats to security.

I couldn‚Äôt see myself in the mirror.
 There was still hope but, damn, it was spinning too fast.
 It seemed like every fucking day something was happening that you had to respond to, you know?
 To not respond was to be dead, to be irrelevant.
 ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt you please come to Chicago just to sing?‚Äù you know?

This was the situation confronting the states of the region at the beginning of the transition period, and the reason why the actual results of the reform differed so drastically from what had been anticipated.
 The situation in Eastern and Central Europe was further complicated by the disproportionately large size and importance of the defence sector in the economy.
 This necessitates, not only a change from one economic system to another, but also a restructuring of the entire economy from a defence orientation to a consumer orientation.
 This change in structure could not be brought about by reliance on macro-economic policy.
 2.Political and social consensus is essential for rapid social change: In a democratic society, the market cannot be instituted by decrees or authoritarian methods which belong to the old sys tem.
 In the new political climate, reforms will be successful only in the measure that they are understood and accepted by the population.
 The vitality of the market depends on releasing the initiative of people to act in their own perceived best interests by producing and distributing goods and services for consumption by others.
 This initiative cannot be ordered, it can only be encouraged.
 Economic policy recommendations failed adequately to anticipate either the impact of the programme on the people or their reaction to it.
 In the early stages of reform, the public exhibited an incredible degree of patience, tolerance and endurance under conditions of growing hardship.

A detailed study of Pune District in the State of Maharashtra has documented the potential for creating 750,000 jobs through this strategy.
 Extrapolation of these results suggests that the 100 million jobs that India needs to create and the 1 billion needed in the developing world are, indeed, achievable, provided that industrial countries adopt trade policies on agricultural products designed to enhance export opportunities for developing nations.
 International Agenda for Food Security
 The crucial importance of food security to world peace and economic development demands that the international community take collective responsibility and initiative to eradicate hunger and famine on a global basis as a complement to the initiatives of individual countries to deal with the problem domestically.
 The growth of food production in developing countries can be accelerated dramatically by the application of resource-based, location-specific strategies that incorporate a proper blending of traditional and frontier technologies and integrate all the links in the chain of production, processing, transport and distribution.
 Conditions vary too widely from country to country for detailed recommendations to be broadly applied.
 However, a number of strategies are relevant to the majority of developing countries.
 Some of the components of an Action Plan designed to achieve this goal are given below.
 1.Elimination of agricultural trade barriers by industrial nations.
 The agreements reached for liberalizing agricultural trade in the Uruguay Round of GATT are an important step forward, but they will not release the full dynamism of the agricultural sector, which is so critical for more rapid growth of incomes and employment in both developing and developed countries.

Then he heard talking and shut his mouth.
 ‚ÄúAre you alright, Dieredon?‚Äù an elf asked.
 The scoutmaster nodded, leaning heavily on his bow.
 ‚ÄúI will be fine.
 His magic left my body upon his death.‚Äù
 A neigh brought his attention upward.
 Sonowin landed next to him, her white hair stained red in places.
 She nuzzled the elf and snorted something.
 ‚ÄúYou worry too much, old girl,‚Äù Dieredon said, his voice cracking several times.
 He patted her once and then turned to the elf standing nearby.

It was a small thing in the grand scheme of the universe, but it was just enough to tilt the balance in her favor.
 I still didn't like her any more than she really liked me, but I was willing to tolerate her.
 To pretend we were friends so that neither of us had to face the scary world entirely on our own.
 "Okay, apology accepted.
 It wasn't very nice, but I suppose everyone makes mistakes."
 Britney's eyes grew bright, even after such a short acquaintance, I knew she was about to launch into a blow-by-blow account of the last twelve or so hours.
 "Listen, I don't mean to be rude, but I've got to finish up my physics homework.
 Can we catch up during lunch?"
 Britney looked a little crestfallen, but her eyes quickly lit back up, and before I could get my notebook out and start writing, she'd already switched seats to one closer to a gaggle of cheerleaders.
 It was amazing that I hadn't made the connection between light, the fact that light acted like a wave, and the rainbows on the parking lot puddles, but it was all making sense now.

The town held only ninety members, half of them younger than eighteen.
 When the second brutal cry rolled over the houses, most were running west, dragging children and carrying young ones in their arms.
 The men, young and old, took up torches, shortswords, even rakes and sickles, and prepared to defend their homes.
 Bravely they fought, and bravely they died.
 ‚ÄúRun, run, run!‚Äù Jeremiah shouted to a mother pulling along a young boy.
 ‚ÄúRun west, and don‚Äôt look back!‚Äù A horrible shriek of pain tore his attention past them to a circle of torches, held by the gathered defenders of the small village.
 He kissed his sword as he approached, horrified by the massacre he saw in the dim light.
 A great half-orc bore down on a strong child of thirteen that Jeremiah knew well.
 Strength in fields and spirit meant little compared to the might of a warrior conducting the dark god‚Äôs power.
 Condemnation tore through his rusted sickle, cut his arm from his body, and then hooked around, severing his ankles.

Underneath me, hundreds of monsters gathered around a fight.
 I couldn‚Äôt see who was fighting inside because a swamp troll blocked my view, but I knew it was brutal the way they whooped at a screech of pain.
 I wanted to close my eyes and look away, but I was so curious to see what was going on, that I couldn‚Äôt.
 The crowd parted to reveal the scariest and most hideous thing I‚Äôve ever seen.
 It must have been some type of faery because I could see long, pointed ears sticking up from the sides of its head.
 Long, black hair was stuck out in all directions on top of its head looking slimy and dirty.
 Sharp, twisted horns sat on top of its head, gleaming in the dark.
 A long, billowing black cloak spiraled out behind it, completely covering the rest of its body.
 Its eyes shined red and full of hate, although there was a terrible smile that danced on its face.
 ‚ÄúVICTORY!‚Äù It boomed in a chilling voice.

Van‚Äôdret almost felt his eye brows rise, ‚Äúof course, but what should I watch out for?
 I heard it was just some sort of accident.
 I was not aware that any of the Knights of the Order were implicated.‚Äù Taiga smiled and waved a hand in a dismissing motion.
 ‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt misjudge my words.
 I did not mean to imply any misdeeds of our valiant Knights of the Soaring Heavens.
 I am not aware of any of them doing much of anything, much less kill an Immortalist.‚Äù ‚ÄúThan what should I keep my eye out for?‚Äù asked Van‚Äôdret.
 He was becoming even more curious to the direction of the conversation.
 ‚ÄúYou, my fine Van‚Äôdret, are more in the world than most of us.
 You are out traveling and adventuring, while most of us Immortalist just sit in our towers.
 I have always thought that our one weakness was our isolation.

No one could even imagine a Hellborn going into the Chamber,‚Äù agreed Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúWell as far behind as we are, we might not even get the chance to try to bully our way in,‚Äù Rodregas said.
 Doi‚Äôvan nodded and that comment seemed to end the conversation.
 As Rodregas headed out to the sands of the Cathedral arena for the jousting match, he was relieved to see Imeralda waiting at the entrance to talk to him.
 She had been out all night on her mission.
 ‚ÄúWell, I have to say I am very tired of talking so I will make this quick,‚Äù she said with her normal sunny smile.
 Rodregas had to admit she did look tired.
 ‚ÄúFirst, Geriodon is much disliked.
 He is gruff, unfriendly and too serious to like.
 The squires and knights universally dislike him.

 ‚ÄúYes, this will do,‚Äù she hummed with a sly grin.
 ‚ÄúLet me see‚Ä¶ yes, I‚Äôve got it.‚Äù She began stepping a slow circle around me, talking as she moved, suddenly cat-like.
 ‚ÄúThe dreams you had after the fairy dust, do you remember them?‚Äù Oh.
 ‚ÄúI have a few questions, you see.
 You had plenty to say about someone as you slept.
 You mentioned how his mouth tasted‚Ä¶ muscles under his shirt.

Are you happy now?
 Then we‚Äôll go back to soaking each other randomly.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm happy.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt call a truce for the warnings.
 I did it because that‚Äôs when I‚Äôd talk to Seth and get his secret out of him.
 Then maybe I could help him and stop having to watch his miserable face.
 Emily made a face and left the room to dial Jason‚Äôs number and tell him about the meeting.
 I waited patiently for her to come back in my room.
 I can‚Äôt wait long because I have a tendency to go crazy, so I walked up to my window sill and looked at the sky.
 I stared it and turned around to see Emily come back in.
 But not before my eyes caught a flash of blue.
 Emily and I parked our bikes and headed into the woods and towards the clearing.

Everything was back to normal.
 There was even a dwarf climbing the slide.
 Wait, hold on.
 A dwarf?
 I elbowed Emily in the arm, ‚ÄúUh Emily, is a dwarf using a slide a normal thing?‚Äù I nodded in the direction of the dwarf and her eyes widened in surprise.
 She jumped off the swing and grabbed me by the arm.
 She ran over to Jason and gripped his arm with her free hand, pulling us both after her.
 Seth frowned but had no choice but to follow.
 ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the dwarf?‚Äù she asked quickly.
 ‚ÄúClimbing the slide.

He looked like total shit, and when we confronted him about it he was feeling bad enough that he confessed: He was addicted to the pain pill known as Oxy.
 He told us that he needed our help to get off of it.
 We never thought to find the reasoning behind the drug abuse, we just thought he had tried it and grew to feel dependent on it.
 He was always a tough kid to raise and he was often a handful and we felt this problem could be handled like any other.
 But we were novices when it came to helping someone kick drug addiction.
 We did our best to assist him and we attempted to detox him at home.
 We called Brandon‚Äôs real doctor (not the ones who prescribe marijuana) and asked for guidance.
 We tried to keep him away from everyone we knew until we could get the drugs out of his system.
 We told no one.
 It needed to be our immediate family‚Äôs dirty little secret.

I started to laugh, only to cut the motion short as I realized there was a better than even chance I'd end up crying instead.
 I settled for just nodding as I swapped books and slammed my locker shut.
 Alec pursed his lips for a second and then nodded, not at me, but at whatever decision he'd just made.
 "We'd better get you to your next class.
 Dealing with that will have to wait until later."
 I wanted to ask what he meant, but the halls were already full of other students, and I was pretty sure he'd tell me when he was ready and not a moment sooner anyways.
 With a sigh, I followed him into the crowd.
 A few minutes later I'd been handed off to my next babysitter, James this time, and was safely ensconced in Mr. Whethers' class.
 Mr. Whethers looked more than a little confused after reading James' note, but he simply added James' name to his roll, and then absently waved the two of us towards seats.
 I would've enjoyed English if not for the wildfire buzz created by my little scene with Alec outside of Biology.

He could not see anyone, but he knew there would be at least two guards left: one at the gate and one in the watchtower over the gate.
 In front of the stable was a large bony horse, dappled in brown and white.
 Rodregas thought her name was Tory or Torin, he could not remember which.
 She was an older horse, in her early twenties, and was known for her mild manor.
 She was saddled and ready to go, evidently she was Korin‚Äôs planned mount.
 Rodregas took a deep breath and calmly walked out of the keep and over to the stables.
 It was not large, ordinarily holding only about a dozen horses.
 He looked around to find that it was emptied out, except for the two carriage horses.
 They must have been left in case Ravenhurr wished to travel, which would be unlikely with all his guards and servants scattered over the town, but good servants did not take their master‚Äôs transport from him.
 In the open central area, he saw both the small carriage and the supply wagon that Ravenhurr used for traveling and carry supplies back and forth to the keep.

Just before he touched me, his cheek slid alongside mine, his mouth at my ear.
 I froze as he spoke low, his breath on my neck sending a shiver through me.
 ‚ÄúStay.
 Still.‚Äù He was gone.
 He moved so fast it took a moment to understand.
 The hood of the cloak was drawn over my head, Chevelle standing a good distance away, facing the trees.
 I was watching him as two men drew near.
 I hadn‚Äôt seen them; they must have been concealed, or camouflaged by magic as I had been days before.
 The tassels decorating their long robes identified them as members of council, but I wasn‚Äôt familiar with the two.
 They mustn‚Äôt have been from the village.

The gates to the abyss opened before his eyes, and he felt the pull on his soul.
 The dark fire already burned.
 He saw the face of his master, and the sick grin there horrified him.
 ‚ÄúI will not die!‚Äù he shrieked.
 ‚ÄúI will not die!‚Äù
 His flesh burned in fire, his bones blew away as dust on the wind, and only an empty robe remained of the being that was Velixar.
 Yet, still haunting the wind, was his final cry, a promise to the world of Dezrel.
 _‚ÄúI will not die!‚Äù_

I have to go home."
 They stayed locked in each other's arms, her tears soaking into his shirt, his tears dripping into her hair.
 At last, Rick, feeling weak and shaky, took Marie's hand and led her to the living room.
 They sat down on the sofa, and he drew her close.
 "I love you more than anything in the world," he whispered into her hair.
 "I love you too.
 But Rick--" "I understand.
 But I don't know how I'm going to bear it."
 They were quiet for several minutes.
 Playing with Rick's fingers, Marie tried to grasp what was happening.

Partly for him but mostly for herself.
 What would he say if he knew that she sometimes went to a speakeasy?
 He'd probably kill her.
 Davis, having missed the irony in her tone, took her hand.
 "Why don't we go back to your house and listen to the radio?"
 That idea appealed to her very much.
 Her parents were out, so she and Davis would be alone.
 Normally, she wouldn't dare be alone at home with a man--her father would be furious.
 But he trusted Davis with her.
 They sat close together holding hands as they listened to a mystery program.

It was just another clearing outside of the only town I‚Äôd ever known, the only town I remembered knowing.
 I wandered toward the briar patch, finding it easily.
 It hadn‚Äôt been far, despite my exhaustion.
 I crawled through the narrow path I‚Äôd made the previous time.
 It hadn‚Äôt seemed such a tight fit in only pants.
 I settled in, jerking a length of skirt free from the thorns with a spray of colorless beads.
 Brushing the loose dirt off the papers I had buried, I laid the soiled documents across my lap and untied the laces binding them together.
 I stared at the words on the ancient parchment, unable to believe what I was reading was true.
 It had to be; it was signed with the official seal, staring back at me from the smudged white fabric of my skirt, the letters on the page as real and words as patent as they could be.
 The documents held the details of a trial, and not only a trial, a punishment.

Do this in remembrance .
 .
 .‚Äô‚Äù and the choir chanted, ‚ÄúSing hallelujah to the Lord‚Äù a breath of Spirit touched me.
 Through all the minutes while wafers got distributed, I heard a small voice reminding me that I ought to pluck the log out of my own eye.
 So I was slightly less mean by the time Mother Teresa walked to the altar.
 In strong yet gentle English, she said, ‚ÄúLet us ask Our Lady to give us her heart, so that we will offer service to the poorest of the poor.‚Äù Neither weathered skin nor stooped shoulders could alter the beauty she exhibited, as she recited from the Gospel of Matthew.
 ‚ÄúWhatever you did for the least of these brothers of mine you did for me.‚Äù Her eloquence depends upon simplicity and a talent for repeating for emphasis without condescension.
 Her message always expresses or implies that by serving the poorest of the poor, the MCs minister to Christ in his distressing disguise.
 This morning she quoted, ‚ÄúFor I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me."
 She only spoke a few minutes, yet three times she asked that we pray for the MCs and the poorest of the poor.

No, I knew better.
 But, I did think‚ÄîI do think‚Äîthat we had to stand for something other than pop ditties, you dig?
 The people who needed help‚Äîwell, it was all so fucking clear then‚ÄîAIM and the draft dodgers and the blacks and, Jesus, I mean, if you couldn‚Äôt see the problem you really were part of the problem.
 So, seeing it, what does one do?
 What could one do?
 Power, in the end, is just another word, too, but the power is gonna belong to someone, so, in the end, who decides?
 Who decides Nixon has more power than Mao, or John Lennon has more power than Roy Cohn?
 You dig?
 I was wrestling with these things, absurd things, but I couldn‚Äôt see clearly.
 All I saw was blackness, the blackness of dried blood.

"Class is about to start, and if every one of you isn't where you're supposed to be before the bell rings, you'll have detention for the next month."
 Vincent's hiss was still almost inaudible.
 "This isn't over."
 I felt my knees almost collapse as the two packs slowly backed away from each other, and Jasmin joined me inside the classroom.
 Mrs. Campbell gave the two of us a considering look after reading Jasmin's note, but sent us off to a pair of empty seats at the back of the classroom without comment.
 We were starting a new unit, but I couldn't concentrate on the lecture.
 Alec's unshakable calm over the last few days had mostly convinced me the other members of his pack had been overreacting.
 Somehow I'd come to believe the coming dispute with Brandon's pack would be resolved as easily as a normal teenage dispute.
 After experiencing such intense, barely restrained violence, I was starting to see just how ludicrous that'd been.
 People had already died over what was going on here.

Harruq slipped into the back and tried to calm down.
 Never before had he done anything like this.
 He had stolen food, fled from guards, lived in poverty, and kept to himself.
 For he and his brother, that was life.
 What the abyss was he doing asking for work?
 A swelling of nerves in his gut almost forced him to leave.
 Several men in front of him turned away, dejected or angry.
 He didn‚Äôt hear the reasons why and didn‚Äôt want to know.
 The idea of so much money, more than enough to buy warm food and clean drink, kept him there.
 At last it was his turn, and he approached the table where Alvrik sat chewing on a piece of bone long since void of meat.

I would need a distraction to have any chance.
 I went to the village to find my young Noble.
 I didn‚Äôt expect what was there.
 On my way in, I found the spot where we had met so many days.
 I almost didn‚Äôt recognize it‚Äîbare of growth, the dirt patted down from years of wear.
 And then I saw him, the man in tattered clothes, hunched with his face in his hands.
 He heard me approach and raised his head, the awe all that was recognizable.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre back.‚Äù His voice was trembling, feeble.
 It was my Noble, young no more.
 He had been waiting here for my return.

Ok, I wrote ‚ÄúBurn my Bridges‚Äù on speed, which is an angry drug, and it‚Äôs such an angry song.
 I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs not one of my favorites now, even though it‚Äôs newish.
 I wrote it one night‚ÄîI think Lor and I had had a fight,  a rare fight, and she had gone to a girlfriend‚Äôs house and I just thought, fuck it, I‚Äôm gonna do speed and stay up all night.
 I didn‚Äôt plan on writing.
 I thought, I‚Äôll just speed and watch late night TV‚Äîthere was some John Agar movie on‚ÄîYou dig John Agar?
 No?
 Don‚Äôt know him?
 Anyway, I was sitting there and there was a legal pad on the coffee table because earlier in the day I had tried writing a song about my mother‚Äîdon‚Äôt ask‚Äîand it was sitting there like an invitation and I was speeding like a hell-rooster, man, and I just picked up the pad and this big fat marker, I mean I was writing these huge thick letters on the  page (laughs) and I just started, ‚ÄúYou were mean to me/Leave me alone, let me sit in my tree/You were a snake, I needed you then/you were like bad heroin.‚Äù  And I ripped the whole thing off in about an hour.
 And I recorded it that night in my living room, fingers tearing over my strings till they bled, I was playing so hard, like Richie, and that song, that was recorded in my home‚Äîit sounds like it.
 But it was born of anger, and so, well, it‚Äôs not one of my faves.

Have I still not spoken?
 His eyes moved down to the pendant against my chest and then quickly back to my face, as if he had committed an indiscretion.
 We sat there for a few more moments, but my words would not return, not with this imposing stranger inches before me.
 When he finally spoke again, I realized his offer of help wasn‚Äôt a request.
 ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs begin with histories.‚Äù He flicked the middle finger of his left hand and a thick ivory tome flew from a shelf, opened, and steadied between us as if on a table.
 There was something so wrong about it, but I couldn‚Äôt say why.
 I pushed away the urge to question an associate of Council, instead asking, ‚ÄúChevelle?‚Äù He smiled.
 It was only one word, but he understood.
 I was asking if I could address him in the common dialog, not the official titles and formalities of the Council he might have been used to.
 His head tilted in a nod.

The massive flower arrangements, which have somehow followed us from every location, are front and center next to a podium where people will once again speak to what a wonderful father, son, brother, (criminal), blah blah blah Dino was.
 Everyone is seated and the service is ready to begin.
 Once the sermon begins, though, guess what is back?
 Yep, we can hear the helicopter, but we can‚Äôt see it through trees and tent.
 The noise gets louder and louder and it suddenly drops down behind the podium.
 The wind from the swirling blades intensifies and the flower displays that sit on tripods start to fall forward and the tent begins to rattle and shake, the wind starts to uproot the tent from the stakes which anchor it.
 The helicopter is facing us and begins to slowly maneuver to expose its side.
 The tent is ripped from the ground and tumbles away leaving a clear view of the black helicopter that is lowering itself closer to the ground.
 The helicopter is about thirty feet above the ground, and now just behind the podium, over the limos.
 The side door slides open revealing two men in black suits.

Evelyn was alive.
 Fannie continued to talk, probably berating me for looking so dumbfounded.
 But I was oblivious; my mind was doing somersaults like a pixie on sweet pea.
 All I could think was, Impossible.
 And then the questions.
 Had the Council known she‚Äôd gone running because I laughed at her?
 Had the thistle grown as she stood beside me?
 Was that what had caused the sneezing?
 Evelyn would tell them I was there.
 They would come for me.

When recognition dawned, I leapt from the rock, cursing Chevelle.
 He turned to me as I yelled, ‚ÄúGive it back!‚Äù He didn‚Äôt appear to know what I was talking about, but I was so angry I was having trouble forming the demand.
 ‚ÄúGive my memories, my mind back!‚Äù His confusion cleared, but Chevelle didn‚Äôt offer a response.
 The fire in me itched to burn him.
 I seethed.
 ‚ÄúUnbind my thoughts.‚Äù ‚ÄúFreya.‚Äù His voice was smooth.
 ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù I fumed, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm sure that has nothing to do with you rummaging around in there.‚Äù He shook his head and his complete lack of agitation caused me to take pause.
 I supposed it was possible he actually couldn‚Äôt free my thoughts.
 If the council had bound me, likely all of them would need to reverse it.
 And they wouldn‚Äôt do that.

Second, granted that the market works effectively for mature capitalist societies with high levels of technology, education, productivity, living standards and food surpluses, and relatively small portions of the workforce dependent on agriculture, is the same necessarily true for countries at an earlier stage of development, in which (1) a majority of the workforce is dependent on agriculture for sustenance, (2) levels of education, productivity and incomes are low, and (3) any increase in food prices can have a devastating impact on food consumption levels in the country?
 The answers to these questions are relevant both to the countries presently making the transition from centrally planned to market economies in Eastern Europe and to poorer developing countries striving to achieve food security.
 Nations accord special status to their agricultural sector for several reasons.
 Continuous supplies of food are absolutely essential to the welfare of the population.
 Food prices are extremely sensitive to changes in the supply of foodstuffs.
 Even a small increase or decrease in supply can lead to a very wide fluctuation in prices.
 A bumper harvest can depress prices to the point of bankrupting large numbers of farmers.
 A poor harvest can send food prices soaring beyond the purchasing power of large numbers of people.
 Buffer stocks, subsidies and incentives are used to protect agriculture from sharp price fluctuations.
 Al though the principles of free trade argue that countries should produce only those items in which they possess a competitive advantage and procure the rest from overseas, few nations are willing to entrust their food supply entirely or even substantially to foreign parties.

It didn't make any sense, she could hardly be blamed for taking care of herself, but it just didn't seem fair.
 Simply by being in the same town as us, she automatically made every other girl in school feel like bloated, heifers.
 Surely she was somehow cheating to be doing so well in the subtle, nasty game in which every high-school girl ranked herself against every other female.
 I probably would've spent the rest of the day depressed, but once she was out of my line of sight I was able to see the boy following her.
 He was incredible.
 Just looking at him drove every other thought out of my mind.
 If the girl who'd just walked by me without acknowledging the existence of any of us lesser beings was every boy's ideal physical specimen, the boy was every girl's dream.
 A gorgeous fantasy breathed into life by some merciful goddess, one who wanted to give us each a glimpse of what awaited good little girls in the afterlife.
 Skin that was a gorgeous shade of tan, not at all artificial-looking, disappeared into the collar of a thin, light-blue button-down shirt.
 The cut of his clothing hinted at designer origins, but the garment was mostly notable for the way it stretched over a pair of broad shoulders that looked like they'd been chiseled from marble, or possibly cast in bronze.

But nothing happened.
 I sat up, holding both hands in front of me, palms up, as I focused on lighting a flame, any flame.
 Nothing.
 I reached out to move a rock from the floor.
 It didn‚Äôt budge.
 I concentrated on a pebble beside me.
 It didn‚Äôt shift in the least.
 ‚ÄúRuby?
 It doesn‚Äôt work.‚Äù I held my hands in front of me, helpless.
 Panic was taking me when she laid a hand on my shoulder and leaned forward.

Not with everything else he couldn't do for me.
 "Please, I must look horrid.
 If you'd known I could look this bad, you'd never have bothered saving me from Simon and Nathanial."
 Alec cocked his head to the side, as if trying to decide how to respond to my half-serious jest.
 "Actually I was completely serious.
 You are beautiful."
 I waited for the inevitable joke, or backhanded compliment to follow, but he seemed happy to just stop there.
 For once in my life I managed to be smart and do the same.
 "So what's the agenda for today?"
 Alec stretched and then shrugged.

Aurelia walked over to him and knelt on one knee.
 She placed a hand on his head and looked over his wounds while he glared up at her.
 ‚ÄúYour wounds are beyond saving,‚Äù she said softly.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù
 She ended his pain with a small lance of ice through his forehead.
 ‚ÄúThank you for your aid,‚Äù one of the elves said.
 ‚ÄúWe must fall back to the forest.
 If they chase us there, it will be suicide.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWe will not have to fall back so far,‚Äù Felewen disagreed.
 ‚ÄúThey have scattered about our town.

The feeling intensified even more as first Jessica and then Jasmin picked up the same strange, near epileptic quiver.
 James let out a low, grating growl, and my stomach dropped as he looked up with eyes that weren't the unremarkable brown they'd been just a second before.
 The hot yellow eyes of a predator were looking out of James' familiar face, changing it into something threatening and inhuman.
 Answering growls from Jasmin and Jessica seemed to snap something inside of Alec.
 His tremble became more pronounced.
 There was a ripping sound, and when I looked down at his hands, they'd been replaced by the same wickedly-sharp claws I remembered from the night before.
 I must have let out a gasp, because Rachel tightened her grasp on me and moved closer.
 She might have whispered something comforting, but I couldn't hear it past the thunder of my own heartbeat.
 All three of them were moving towards us now.
 It was so inhumanly smooth and slow the motion was almost imperceptible, but I was certain they were stalking us.

Seth swung his sword at the back of the snake but there was a flash and it sliced his arm instead.
 He winced and dropped his weapon.
 The snake had wrapped around his neck and was squeezing.
 I gripped my knife but stopped when the creature snickered from the ground.
 ‚ÄúI wouldn't do that if I were you,‚Äù it said.
 ‚ÄúThat wouldn't be wise.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I demanded.
 ‚ÄúIt wouldn't be right to help Seth?‚Äù It hissed in laughter.
 ‚ÄúNo, half-ling.
 If you haven't realized it yet, we change our shapes.
 Your friend already hurt himself learning that.‚Äù Seth wasn't looking so good.

At the other end of the spectrum, ICT is opening up unparalleled opportunities for self-employment and new business creation for the educated.
 Today more than 50 per cent of American workers utilize computers in their work.
 The growth of the World Wide Web has given rise to on-line global markets in which individuals can bid for a broad range of projects involving activities such as research, translation, technical writing, proofreading, desktop publishing, and business consulting.
 A new publication identifies a few hundred self-employment opportunities of this kind.
 The future of work will offer increasing opportunities for people throughout the world to match their specialized knowledge and skills with specialized employment opportunities wherever they may originate.
 Meeting the Skill Shortage: Perhaps the single greatest opportunity for employment growth lies in addressing the growing mismatch between the skills of job seekers and the skills required for expanding economies.
 In both industrial and developing countries, workers may be in surplus, but the skills needed are in deficit.
 In the most prosperous nations, the deficit is concentrated in high technology and professional sectors, in electronics, biotechnology, health care, pharmacology, mathematics, marketing, financial services, and the like.
 The adoption of new technologies even in traditional occupations has resulted in a growing demand for higher skill levels in these fields as well.
 Unemployment is highest among the least educated, least skilled categories, such as machine operators, fabricators and labourers.

He was strong and he let her feel his strength, but he also gave her plenty of leverage so that if she truly wanted to pull away she could.
 He was making his desire clear, but the decision was hers.
 He cared for her too much, and was so determined to walk the path of righteousness and he was determined to be very careful.
 A younger man would have been in a hurry.
 But Rodregas was lost in the softness of her lips, the look of her eyes, and the beauty of her spirit.
 He wished he could make this moment last forever.
 Rodregas believed that most women did not know if they were interested until a man makes his move.
 It is something instinctive; there is a single moment when either it clicks or it does not.
 The moment held unmoving, the dice were rolling; and she responded to his kiss, but did not sink into his arms.
 She was making a hard decision.

A conscious and systematic effort is required at the international level to put in place both the institutions and the technology for information superhighways needed to support peace, democracy and sustainable development in the twenty-first century.
 Building Social Organization for Development
 The achievement of peace, food security and full employment cannot be accomplished without more fully utilizing one of the most creative and productive of all human resources ‚Äì organization.
 The march of humanity is marked by the development of larger-scale, more complex and more efficient types of organizations to serve higher and wider social needs.
 Advances in the technology of organization, as much as advances in the technology of production, have been responsible for global progress during the present century and, especially, during the post-war period.
 We have argued earlier that establishment of effective and lasting peace requires a radical restructuring of the existing institutions for global governance.
 Unless and until the UN comes to embody in its own functioning the principles of representative democracy, it cannot hope to play a leading role in maintaining peace and freedom in the world.
 As government and political leaders know only too well, an organization with responsibility but without authority is doomed to failure.
 Unless UN member states invest international institutions with the necessary authority and meet their financial commitments to support them, the world will continue to drift and flounder, powerless to oppose petty dictators and ruthless aggression.
 Unless a cooperative world military force comes into existence, every country will continue to be burdened with the enormous expense and insecurity characteristic of the old system.

I am here because this is where the drug dealers will meet me.
 They have $2500 in cash in exchange for the one hundred 80 milligram Oxycontin tablets which are in a small plastic bottle, tucked away into my jacket pocket.
 I have just turned fifty years old, which is older than the combined age of the young couple who will be meeting me.
 It is early 2009, and the drug I have in my pocket was not even available when I was a teenager.
 In my younger days the contents in my pocket would have been cocaine or marijuana, but times have changed.
 The eventual recipients of these pills will be the addicts who crave them more than a next meal or the love of their family, or anything for that matter.
 The pills are small, round and an odd green color‚Äîa powerful prescription drug manufactured to relieve severe pain.
 They are essentially synthetic heroin, and much sought after by the drug addicts who litter your streets, work alongside you and perhaps sit next to you at a family dinner.
 They are daughters or sons or parents.
 The street price for these pills could reach up to $80 each while the co-pay at the pharmacy for the insured who are prescribed these pills could be as little as $10 for a quantity of ninety.

She hummed as she gathered, throwing a cloak at me in the process.
 I tied it on and drew the hood up.
 ‚ÄúWant me to carry anything?‚Äù She eyed me as if I was entirely absurd.
 ‚ÄúWell, if you would like to, I can find something for you.‚Äù I glared at her back and she turned to grab my arm beneath the cloak, yanking me behind her as we left the house through her closet.
 She replaced the cover that hid the entrance and snatched a quiver of arrows from the ground before pulling me forward again.
 ‚ÄúWhat are those for?‚Äù I asked, indicating the arrows, afraid they would somehow be used in my training.
 ‚ÄúThey are arrows, Frey.‚Äù She was really on a roll today, a delightful mood.
 I shook my head, certain that didn‚Äôt bode well for me, and she laughed.
 ‚ÄúWe are leaving them for Rhys and Rider to find.‚Äù ‚ÄúAre they poisoned?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù I considered that.
 ‚ÄúDid they use all the ones you prepared last night?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre silly, Freya.

I scooted my desk over and picked up a weight to hand to him, only to see the thread break as he successfully figured out the breaking point.
 Again and again it happened.
 I ran a calculation for how many pulleys we'd need to lift our weight up the thirty-degree incline on a string able to hold only a fourth as much, only to look over at his paper and see not only had he already arrived at the correct figure, he'd already thought to adjust for starting friction.
 Not used to being outclassed academically, I got flustered, which led to a misplaced decimal, and then an incorrect conversion from English to metric.
 Alec just continued on, never seeming to really hurry, never actually making a mistake, but still grinding through calculations with a speed I might have been able to match on a good day, but couldn't even approach today.
 It would've been much easier to just stop my efforts and watch him work, but I was too stubborn to give up.
 Alec finished up with the theoretical portion of the assignment, and started stringing the pulleys while most of the other groups were still arguing over whether or not they could afford to add a few extra grams for extra credit.
 If there was a single person in the class who¬†didn't¬†need any extra credit, it was Alec; but he calmly loaded the system with an extra sixteen grams, caught Mrs. Alexander's eye, and then smoothly started the train of weights moving up the ramp, over the wall, through the woods, and right up to Grandma's house.
 It wasn't fair that someone who missed so many days of school could be so consistently right.
 He must have an IQ of 160.

 Tears filled her eyes yet again, and she snatched up a tissue to dab at them to keep from ruining her make-up.
 Rick loved her.
 And-and .

 she loved him.
 But she couldn't stay here.
 The thought of never going home, of never seeing her parents or brother or Tom-- A sob caught in her throat, and she squeezed her eyes shut.
 She wanted to go home, but when she left Rick, her heart would break.

 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be too shocked.
 You have elven blood in you as well.
 I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you lasted a couple hundred years yourself.

 Harruq gasped at the thought.

 The idea of living two hundred years was‚Ä¶‚Äåwell, more than he could handle.

I shook my head.
 "I told Mrs. Campbell I'd stay the whole time.
 I'm not lying for you or anyone else."
 Rachel piped up unexpectedly.
 "It's okay, Britney.
 If you want to leave we'll give her a ride home."
 I could see the wheels turning in her head.
 If I really did have a ride, she could leave without ruining things with Brandon; but if I wasn't going to lie, then there was a good chance that Mrs. Campbell would find out she'd left early.
 Parents were relatively easy to fool.
 Leave the tutor lab early, go somewhere else and kill some time until you were supposed to come home, and they'd never know the difference.

For economic and social development to take place, it is important to promote the expansion of employment opportunities, the improvement of educational and health networks, support for the role of women in development and the pursuit of equality between the sexes.
 A hitherto ignored dimension of the development challenge is democratization: what I have chosen to call political development.
 There have been cases where development was accompanied by an authoritarian political system.
 But we have invariably seen that if the participation in the market place is not accompanied by political participation, development efforts are brought to naught by social and political instability.
 Political, economic and social development must be closely related, mutually supportive, deriving sustenance from one another.
 Once again, therefore, we see the inescapable relations governing the goals of peace, development and democratization these are the goals of the United Nations.
 The United Nations has, over the years, devoted great time and attention to the issues before the Commission on Peace and Food.
 In the research, analysis, debate, consensus-building and actual operational activities of the United Nations System, the issues of peace, develop ment and democratization have been at the forefront.
 The Members of the International Commission on Peace and Food have interacted closely with the United Nations Funds, Programmes and Specialized Agencies.
 This report brings together many of the issues which are central to the reflection on development which the United Nations is trying to encourage, leading to the World Summit on Social Development to be held in 1995.

It is in this context that the European Union, the United States and other Western governments have been considering ambitious proposals for addressing this issue.
 The Australian government has unveiled a $4.6 billion jobs package to reduce unemployment from 10 per cent to 5 per cent by the end of the decade by encouraging training for the young, the unskilled and the long-term unemployed.
 Recently the OECD has presented the main planks of an employment strategy to stimulate economic growth in the industrial nations, make labour markets more flexible, increase productivity, and revamp employment and unemployment security provisions.
 The relative success of the US economy in creating jobs during the past decade has prompted other countries to emphasize the importance of policies to increase the flexibility of wage rates and bring down the price of labour by reductions in the statutory minimum wage.
 The main effect of this policy is likely to be a movement of jobs between nations, however, not a significant increase in the total number of jobs available.
 In fact, measures which reduce wage incomes could have the perverse effect of reducing aggregate purchasing power and employment.
 Economic growth is recognized as an essential, though not sufficient, condition for higher rates of job growth ‚Äì but fears of inflation constrain industrial countries from trying to stimulate faster expansion of their economies.
 The primary impact of moderate levels of inflation would be to encourage an outflow of investment to more stable currencies.
 How ever, if the industrial nations all agreed to relax their monetary policies, this effect could be minimized.
 The real constraint on job creation in the industrial nations is not the price of labour, but the need for increased capital investment, partly to counter the effects of reduced military spending and the drastic fall in output and demand in Eastern Europe.

They turned in opposite directions, each disappearing behind the trees and rocks that strewed the mountain, as I stood alone and confused.
 I sat, shaking my head as I stared down at the bark of the tree.
 Chevelle returned quickly with two small, furred animals slung over his back.
 As his gaze reached the log that lay in front of me, it burst into an orange flame, thin branches forming a spit as he skinned and attached the animals.
 The process was so smooth, I couldn‚Äôt say exactly what had happened.
 Chevelle was changing.
 Or, more likely, he was becoming more himself.
 He wasn‚Äôt as formal.
 He seemed relaxed, and apparently magic, quick and powerful, was intertwined into his every routine.
 He didn‚Äôt need to do much by hand; I would have spent hours trying to build a spit and skin an animal.

You understand, don't you, sweetie?"
 I nodded, and managed a fairly convincing smile.
 "Okay, then.
 Well there's a present for you in the living room, but since you didn't want to celebrate until after school, you'll have to wait to open it."
 I could definitely hear the rumble of a high-performance engine.
 I nodded again, and turned to go, hopeful that I could avoid the inevitable question of why Brandon was coming to pick me up in the mornings as well as dropping me off most afternoons.
 Unfortunately, Mom's hearing was nearly as good as mine, and she was walking towards the windows before I managed to get the door open.
 "Adri, who's that?"
 It was obviously one of those leading questions designed to see whether or not I'd try to lie.
 I shrugged.

 Chapter 1 Stepping back out into the relentless desert sun, I once again wished we were still back in Minnesota, or at least that we were done moving.
 Then again I might as well have been wishing that Mom had decided on somewhere other than Utah, or that we'd had some long-lost relative die and leave us a small fortune, or even better that Dad and Cindi...
 The thought was much too dangerous to complete.
 My breathing had already sped up, and my balance degenerated so quickly it was a small miracle I made it over to the U-Haul before I keeled over.
 I'd hated the battered vehicle that had spent the last two days carrying us west across I-80.

"Can you show me now?‚Äù Rodregas hesitated; he did not want to show her the books right away.
 Instead, he wanted to see what kind of training Doi‚Äôvan had.
 But he had never been able to turn down a beautiful woman.
 ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù he said walking back to the barn and the wagon.
 Rodregas jumped on the back, making the wagon squeal in alarm at his weight, and opened ‚Äòhis‚Äô trunk and pulled out the last blanket left in it, the one he had wrapped the books up in.
 Rodregas unrolled the blanket on the back of the now mostly empty wagon showing the dozen books that he had saved from Ravenhurr‚Äôs library.
 Imeralda reached out for one of the closest, but then stopped as her fingers touched them, as if a spark of lightning had hit her.
 Obviously, she could feel that same power Rodregas had.
 That was interesting.
 She then ran her hand from one to the next until she had touched all twelve books.

You are more, well, I think the only way to describe it is more nymph-like.
 There are tales of eating the blessings of the One Tree, most of the greatest Nymphs of our history all claim this.
 A Forest Nymph simply becomes more connected to the forest, and some also claim to gain more than one elemental power.
 There are only a few stories of those people who have been adopted as Nymphs who have earned the blessing, but I have no idea what effect it will have,‚Äù she said.
 With a shrug she added, ‚ÄúBut I do not think it will help much on the battlefield.‚Äù Rodregas nodded.
 It might have little practical effect, but he knew that while a greater sigil might make him a great fighter and that while fighting was necessary, it had no real inherent value.
 It simply made one better at fighting.
 Somehow he knew the blessing was inherently a positive thing.
 He remembered on hot sunny days as a kid the wonderful pleasure of lying under a tree when the city would be so hot in the summer, but in the shade of the tree it was just perfect.
 It was a random thought, but a good one.

 I might be scoring a movie for Robert Altman.

Based on the precedent of the Chemical Weapons Treaty, the proposal for a universal ban on the possession of nuclear weapons by any nation should be placed before the Security Council for a vote.
 The five permanent members should agree to the suspension of their veto power on this issue so crucial to the future of humanity.
 8.The danger to all nations of unexpected and unprovoked attack from near or distant powers can be vastly reduced by declaring an immediate ban on the use of ballistic missiles of all types, including those carrying conventional war heads.
 This would eliminate the discriminatory provisions that deny missile acquisition to some while preserving the right of others to maintain and develop this purely offensive capability.
 It would also eliminate the need for missile defence systems, which no nation can afford and which are the only possible defence against ballistic missile weapons.
 The ban on use should be followed by urgent measures to dismantle and scrap this entire class of weapons worldwide.
 9.Highest priority must be given to controlling and reversing the proliferation of small arms in line with the determined international measures employed to curb hijacking.
 As an immediate first step, these weapons should be classified and a UN register created to monitor their manufacture and sale.
 Agreements should be negotiated between major arms suppliers to severely restrict production and sales.
 Strong sanctions must be instituted to discourage states from actively or passively abetting small arms proliferation, especially to non-state actors.

"How did you know my name?"
 "Oh, that's easy.
 Sanctuary is the smallest town on the face of the world.
 Anything out of the ordinary is instantly gossip fodder.
 I'll bet half the town knew you and your mom had purchased the old Anderson house before the ink was dry on the mortgage.
 The other half learned about it at church the next day."
 I tried to smile, but I found it more than a little unnerving.
 Big city life hadn't been so intrusive.
 I hadn't even known my neighbors growing up.
 In Minneapolis the people you lived next to and the people you associated with were always kept properly segregated.

"Adriana, but I don't need any help."
 Albert smiled.
 "I know your card wasn't on the red side, but Mrs. Campbell asked me to stop by and go over a couple of steps you left out on your homework assignment from today.
 Since I just finished with Rachel and was over here already, I thought I'd show you the steps you're missing."
 I nodded my assent as I mentally filed away both his name and the girl's.
 Surprisingly enough, Albert was a good teacher, pointing out the steps I'd been skipping over, and even explaining why they were important.
 It was rare enough to find a school teacher who could really teach math these days, finding a student who could teach was nearly a miracle.
 Rachel packed up her things while I was being instructed in the finer points of inequalities.
 As she slid the last book into her backpack, Albert stepped away from my desk with another smile.
 I flipped over to the next chapter and started in on functions as Rachel exited out a corner door I hadn't noticed before.

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù she responded.
 ‚ÄúBut it will probably be harder and slower than if you were learning earlier in life.
 It requires relearning something that is almost an instinct at this point in your life.
 Part of the problem is that the spell to activate the magic in the bow is just very different than anything you have probably done before.‚Äù Rodregas knew she was speaking the truth.
 He had never thought he was going to be some powerful mage.
 The fact that Doi‚Äôvan had so easily learned the spell just reminded him of how many times in his life he had failed to have the ability to succeed in things that he really wanted.
 Rodregas‚Äô new body was very gifted, but it was still mortal and some things he would just not be able to do as well as others.
 In some ways this was reassuring, a connection to his past.
 ‚ÄúCan I ask you a question?‚Äù she asked.
 Rodregas smiled and said, ‚Äúof course, what?‚Äù ‚ÄúHave you thought of trying to become a sigil warrior?

 A sprinkle of glitter hit my face before I had the chance to protest.
 ‚ÄúJust a touch,‚Äù she assured me, ‚Äújust a touch.‚Äù It was too late.
 The dust had already taken effect.
 I relaxed onto the bed, just as Ruby did the same beside me.
 We stared at her ceiling unspeaking for an immeasurable amount of time.
 I rolled on my side toward her, dimly irritated she‚Äôd poisoned me again.
 Though it was much less severe this time.
 I was simply enveloped in tranquility.

Adrenaline was surging and suddenly Rodregas had a bloody mess in his hand.
 The guard was very dead.
 Rodregas let go of the broken neck and stood quickly, trying to clear himself of the gore.
 Both slavers looked shocked at what had happened and Rodregas moved quickly to take advantage of their surprise.
 He went to the right and slammed his remaining sword into the Orqui.
 The slaver grunted with pain and surprise at his quick change of targets.
 Rodregas‚Äô short sword caught him in the shoulder.
 The guard half fell and half stumbled away to safety.
 Rodregas turned to the final slaver and saw fear in his eyes.
 Then Rodregas looked around and saw that he was no longer facing just one remaining opponent, but now faced four including another Immortal Guard and three more slavers.

"No, I want to stay, but how can I knowing it will mean you're going to be fighting to the death?"
 Alec tossed the branch away with a sigh.
 "I've spent years learning control, but sometimes I still forget just how breakable everything around me is.
 If you go back to Brandon, you support his claim that you belong to him, and I'd still be forced to challenge him.
 If I didn't, he would be justified in killing whichever two of my friends he wants."
 "So there's no way you can avoid fighting him?"
 Alec's smile was more bittersweet than normal.
 "No, but it's not too late to save you.
 I can have you on a flight to Paris tonight.
 It's the only way to guarantee your safety."

We‚Äôre all sinners, he said, and we‚Äôre sinners by choice.
 We choose to break God's moral laws.
 We become drunkards or fornicators, selfish, consumed with pride and prejudice and intolerance.
 But the sinful heart can‚Äôt find happiness.
 And God, he assured us, wants his creatures to get happy, which is why Christ said we must be born again, so he could give us new moral natures, new affections, new objectives, and new directions.
 What planted the hook in me was: according to Billy Graham, when you make your decision for Christ, you do it for the sake of the nation and the world.
 Without God, any nation will perish.
 And a nation is only as strong as its people.
 A better world requires better nations of better people.
 Christ can make us into those people.

Some Common Challenges
 Listing future achievements does not mitigate the very real and pressing problems that confront us now.
 A brief catalogue suffices to indicate the magnitude of these challenges.
 Population: In spite of the continued decline in birth rates, world population is expected to rise by nearly three billion people or 50 per cent over the next three decades, making the task of achieving food security, employment and education for all even more daunting than it is today.
 Poverty: The incidence of poverty continues to increase both in relative and absolute terms.
 Presently, 1.4 billion people, constituting 26 per cent of the total population of developing and developed nations, live in poverty.
 The poorest 20 per cent of the world‚Äôs population share a minuscule 1.4 per cent of the world‚Äôs income.
 According to current projections, 300 million people, representing nearly 50 per cent of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, will live below the poverty line at the turn of the century.
 Environment: Unsustainable lifestyles and consumption (in industrial countries) and population growth, along with rising levels of production and consumption (in developing countries), will place strenuous demands on the environment of the planet.
 Growing damage to the basic life support systems of soil, water, flora, fauna and the atmosphere is taking place in all parts of the world.

 Um, when did you get your first real guitar?
 BG:  	That was‚Äîoh, when I was eleven, I think.
 I had played around on an old box guitar Dad brought home‚ÄîI think it was a gift from Mr. Delisi actually.
 We had to sort of sneak it into the house (laughs) but it was old and didn‚Äôt sound very good, though I had fun trying to pick out Carter Family or Pete Seeger songs on it.
 Or blues chords.
 And, of course, I had a Mel Bay instructional book.
 I think Dad heard me, saw that I was progressing beyond his wildest dreams and bought me that electric guitar, without asking Mom, without thinking it was her business, you know?
 He saw that I was really good, that I could be something special.
 So he bought me this electric‚Äîit was a Hofner Futurama, if you can believe it.

His new body was very large and very muscular, and much stronger than he would have guessed.
 Rodregas lifted his right arm and curled it into a tight muscle.
 He felt the biceps with his free hand.
 The texture under the skin felt like bundles of large, powerful cables.
 He felt his face break into a smile; he had seen this face smile when it had been a prisoner.
 The smile the prisoner had worn was a very open charming smile.
 The smile he felt on his face now had little resemblance to the one he remembered seeing, though without looking in the mirror he had no way of knowing for sure.
 ‚ÄúCome on up, Korin.
 I have a surprise for you,‚Äù Rodregas whispered under his breath.
 He went around the room one final time poking around for anything else of note and, finding nothing, went over to the door to the water closet.

 He was dressed in a long green cloak, silvery armor, and he bore his bow openly.

 It smacked the dirt an inch from Antonil‚Äôs foot.

 Brandon had been dealing Oxy for the past few years and the police had been looking to get him.
 Brandon had at one time been moving thousands of these tiny green prescription pain pills through California, making nighttime drives to Los Angeles and back to buy huge quantities to supply the Sacramento area.
 They were charging him with three felonies and he was facing five plus years in prison.
 Faced with the charges, Brandon waved his attorney rights and talked too much‚Äî a strung out drug addict who just got popped.
 The interrogation lasted nearly twenty hours; although, to Brandon, it felt like three days.
 Faced with the abundance of evidence and the thought of five years in prison, Brandon broke and agreed to bust a dealer named Steve.
 The interesting thing about Steve was that much of the information the officers had on Brandon was from Steve.
 It‚Äôs quite a tangled web.
 Steve had been busted some time ago and released when he agreed to work with the narcotics division of the police department.

 "I really like it when you kiss my neck."
 Chuckling, he dropped a kiss onto her neck.
 "Any other secrets?"
 "Yes," she whispered.
 "When-when Davis .

 put his tongue in-in my mouth, I didn't like it.
 But you--with you, I like it."

"Please go to bed, Marie."
 "But Rick--" "Just go to bed.
 Please."
 He didn't look up when she finally complied.
 He'd never known such ecstatic misery.
 He wanted her so much that, 20 minutes after she'd gone, his hands were still trembling.
 Was he a fool?
 She'd begged him to keep kissing her.
 She'd been so caught up in their kisses and caresses that she probably wouldn't have stopped him no matter how he'd touched her.
 He could have made love to her.

And you are more visible.
 And‚Äî‚Äù I held up a hand.
 ‚ÄúAll right, I have it.‚Äù She smiled.
 ‚ÄúAny more questions or can we begin?‚Äù ‚ÄúFine.
 What sort of weapon did you have in mind?‚Äù Her smile widened.
 Her hand stretched out to the side and a long, silver sword came from the pile of gear to land in her palm.
 She righted it, twisting the blade for me to see.
 My stomach dropped.
 ‚ÄúThere are a few things you need to remember when using a blade,‚Äù she instructed.
 ‚ÄúFirst of all, always go for the fatal attack.

The fierce pain appeared to knock some sense into him.
 He looked down at Aurelia with a mixture of anger and embarrassment.
 ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù he said.
 Blood ran from a busted lip.
 The skin on his cheek was already blackening.
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what just happened,‚Äù she said, the quiver in her voice belying her calm speech.
 ‚ÄúBut I know I don‚Äôt like it and will not accept it.
 Ever.
 Is that clear?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs not one of my favorites now, even though it‚Äôs newish.
 I wrote it one night‚ÄîI think Lor and I had had a fight,  a rare fight, and she had gone to a girlfriend‚Äôs house and I just thought, fuck it, I‚Äôm gonna do speed and stay up all night.
 I didn‚Äôt plan on writing.
 I thought, I‚Äôll just speed and watch late night TV‚Äîthere was some John Agar movie on‚ÄîYou dig John Agar?
 No?
 Don‚Äôt know him?
 Anyway, I was sitting there and there was a legal pad on the coffee table because earlier in the day I had tried writing a song about my mother‚Äîdon‚Äôt ask‚Äîand it was sitting there like an invitation and I was speeding like a hell-rooster, man, and I just picked up the pad and this big fat marker, I mean I was writing these huge thick letters on the  page (laughs) and I just started, ‚ÄúYou were mean to me/Leave me alone, let me sit in my tree/You were a snake, I needed you then/you were like bad heroin.‚Äù  And I ripped the whole thing off in about an hour.
 And I recorded it that night in my living room, fingers tearing over my strings till they bled, I was playing so hard, like Richie, and that song, that was recorded in my home‚Äîit sounds like it.
 But it was born of anger, and so, well, it‚Äôs not one of my faves.
 Lor came back about dawn and I was still up and I was crying, just sitting there crying with the guitar in my lap, and she put her arms around me, and that‚Äôs the story of that song.

 Johnny ‚Äì What do you expect?
 Jim is a very special child.
 Eugene ‚Äì Even so, having a girl like Elizabeth Straun feeling that way about you, and not doing anything about it.
 You must have eaten lead paint as a child.
 Jim ‚Äì Don‚Äôt you mean lead paint chips?
 Eugene ‚Äì No, I mean lead paint, out of the bucket, with a spoon.
 Jim ‚Äì Not that I‚Äôm aware of, but that doesn‚Äôt mean anything, I don‚Äôt recall much of anything from before about the age of three.
 So for all I know I could have eaten nothing but paint at that time,

If Isaac had been the one close enough to reach out and touch, I probably would've tried to get his attention and said hi.
 With Vincent, I just stayed quiet and hoped he wouldn't notice me.
 I didn't want to risk tripping and making my ankle worse, so I was paying especially close attention to where my feet were going.
 If I hadn't been looking down, I would have completely missed it.
 I still almost thought I'd imagined it, but there was no denying that Vincent's foot snaked out and nudged the ankle of the kid in front of him just hard enough to trip the smaller guy.
 The result was all out of proportion to what I expected.
 The smaller boy fell forward, careening towards the banister with so much force he knocked people in front of him out of the way.
 Just before I left elementary school someone had read us a newspaper article about some poor guy being pushed over a railing and falling to his death.
 I'd had nightmares for months.
 Dreams where the stairs had turned slick and I'd slid all the way down them.

Jim - Technically he did fall down the stairs.
 But his dad was the one who kicked him and made him fall.
 He pretty much moved in here ever since that happened, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs been home since for more than five minutes at a time.
 And never when his dad is home.
 Liz ‚Äì Why don‚Äôt the police do anything about it?
 We should have that bastard arrested.
 Jim ‚Äì Eugene won‚Äôt press charges.
 He only ever says that he tripped.
 He‚Äôs been doing it since he was a kid.
 You know him, he won‚Äôt fight, no matter how he pretends at being evil.

 One day I woke up and I felt pretty good, you know.
 The sun was coming in the window there and I was digging the way the dust motes floated in it, as if they were little living things, and I thought, I‚Äôve had enough of this shit.
 And I got dressed.
 Lor came in that morning and I was sitting there in my clothes waiting for her.
 We checked me out.
 We went down to the nurse‚Äôs station and said, room 1324 checking out.

But I think she would have to cheat to do it.
 Jim ‚Äì An entire company?
 How do you cheat to in a drinking contest?
 Liz ‚Äì If I told you that, then what edge would I have if we ever had a drinking contest?
 Jim ‚Äì I‚Äôll avoid drinking against you in the future.
 Is that another thing mothers teach their daughters?
 How to drink like a room full of men?
 Liz ‚Äì Well my mother taught me how to do it, I don‚Äôt know about what ‚Äònormal‚Äô mothers do with their daughters.
 But that is one of the valuable life skills that I learned under my mother‚Äôs tutelage.

 Velixar roared, a sound that made Qurrah shiver and avert his eyes.
 His master‚Äôs back was to him, so he could not see the face that Dieredon saw, which was full of rotted skin and crawling, feasting things.
 Suddenly Dieredon pulled back.
 The blades in his bow snapped inward.
 ‚ÄúArrows cannot hurt me,‚Äù Velixar mocked.
 ‚ÄúThey did not the first time.
 Why do you hope so now?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúBecause these arrows are different.‚Äù
 He fired three at once, all burying deep into Velixar‚Äôs chest.

Your master was blind.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúHe was weakened,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúEven the clumsiest of fighters can slay a sleeping man.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúHow old were you then?‚Äù Velixar asked.
 ‚ÄúNine,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 The man in black shook his head.
 His expression showed there would be no further argument.
 ‚ÄúIf you had been mine at the age of nine‚Ä¶‚Äå my previous apprentice Xelrak held but a shred of your strength.‚Äù
 Qurrah straightened at the name.

I was simply enveloped in tranquility.
 ‚ÄúRuby‚Ä¶‚Äù Her curls had tumbled back and my complaint fell short as I was distracted by her ears.
 ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù she answered.
 I reached up to feel my own ears as I considered hers.
 I had always hidden mine behind hair, never braiding it back or putting it up to expose them.
 Not that I could have pulled off the intricate braiding and designs of the other elves.
 But my ears were clearly more rounded than everyone else‚Äôs, almost blunt.
 Ruby‚Äôs were different, too.
 Hers were more angular though, long and almost pointed at the tip.
 Neither of us matched the norm.

 I don‚Äôt like just staying here, when more monsters might come.
 We can‚Äôt do two things at once.‚Äù Emily nagged anyway.
 I could just picture her bouncing up and down on her heels, full of tension.
 I felt rush of hot air near my left side.
 Seth was probably sighing, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt move her Emily.
 If we could, we would.‚Äù I opened my eyes to see Seth face hovering above me.
 Emily was pacing in the background and Jason was standing off to the side, looking very uninterested in the current situation.
 Seth smiled at me and I felt myself blush.
 It was kind of embarrassing to get knocked out when no one else did.

One moment she was growling at Jess from a distance of more than five feet, the next instant she was on top of Jess, and her teeth were latched around the smaller wolf's throat.
 Dominic's hand tightened on mine as Jess began to whine, but Alec took a menacing step forward and Jasmin released Jessica with another growl.
 "She didn't want to let go, did she?"
 Dom looked for a second like she wasn't going to answer, but she finally shook her head.
 "It's harder to control the instincts, the beast inside us, if you will, while we're in an alternate form.
 Hybrid, wolf, cat, to one extent or another, we become the beast, and if there's one thing animals have figured out, it's that you don't survive by letting a beaten opponent live to learn from their mistakes."
 I felt a shudder go through me at what she was saying.
 "So Alec wasn't kidding when he said it wasn't safe for me to be here?"
 "You're probably not in any more danger today than you were that first night.
 Jessica isn't any fonder of you now than she was then.

"My son proposing with the family diamond and my daughter getting married in the family wedding gown.
 A mother's dream."
 Marie tried to smile, but the thought of that wedding gown, that symbol of tradition and family and home, upset her.
 Yesterday it had made her long for home.
 Now it made her long for Rick.
 She wanted to wear it for him.
 She certainly wasn't going to wear it for Davis.
 After breakfast Mr. Tranton went to call his daughter‚Äôs betrothed.
 Marie was in the living room with her mother and brother, and they jumped when they heard him begin shouting.
 They'd had only enough time to look at each other in bewilderment when Mr. Tranton joined them.

I felt my eyelids drooping by the time she came back.
 "They want me to leave right now.
 She said she's already arranged for a charter plane out of St. George.
 If I leave in the next ten minutes, we can make the flight out of Salt Lake International with something like half an hour to spare."
 We both sat there in silence for a few seconds as everything sank in, and then Mom exploded into motion.
 She ran downstairs to repack her photography equipment, all the while yelling upstairs to verify that I'd packed all of the other essentials she was going to need.
 Almost before I'd even finished assimilating how quickly Alec had pulled everything together, Mom was backing down the lane as I waved goodbye.
 Alec appeared within thirty seconds of Mom's departure, Isaac close behind him.
 "We need to go.

 The elf lowered his face so the fury in his eyes was all Harruq could see.

 But know I will be watching you, and I will be watching your brother.

‚ÄúHe was putty in her hands.
 It was all over before he even knew her purpose.
 She kept him under her enchantments and lies as long as she could.
 She thought she was safe hiding here in the village but, as you know, an elf birth is a hefty event.
 Upon the hour of my birth, the entire village had gathered to see the new elf‚Äîat my father‚Äôs request, of course.
 Can you imagine the shock when they found my mother was his intended?‚Äù She laughed, but her audience was quiet.
 Chevelle, expression uncomfortable, turned to watch out the front window.
 ‚ÄúNeedless to say, it did not go as she had planned.
 At her death, my father was released from her bonds.
 He was horrified at what he had done, at what had been done to him.

Later he would explain I had made a neat flip while careening into the pool.
 He led me inside, wetted a washcloth and dabbed the wound on my forehead until I faded.
 I awoke on the outskirts of heaven, gazing across a chasm at the enchanted forest.
 The air resonated with music, clean and simple melodies, at once ardent, tender and joyful.
 Maybe it was a dream.
 Or a premonition.
 Or, for all I know, I might have briefly died.
 The spell broke and left me sprawled in the Desert Inn.
 I lay still a while, sore all over, with a throbbing skull, wishing to go back to heaven.
 Then I got up, swallowed a few aspirin, and roused Eric to tell him about my adventure.

 I noticed that Seth was avoiding my eyes.
 ‚ÄúSo whose crazy idea was it to meet under a truce when we‚Äôre having so much fun wreaking havoc on each other?‚Äù Jason asked.
 Emily sighed and pointed at me, ‚ÄúThis crazy person right here.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo what do you want?‚Äù he continued and eyed me.
 I took a small, quiet breath and said what I had planned, ‚ÄúI want to work on the dwarf problem.‚Äù I nodded towards Emily, signaling her to take out her paper.
 She groaned and pulled the folded piece of paper out of her pocket.
 She unfolded it and placed it in front of us.
 While we studied it, I tried to catch Seth‚Äôs eye, but he didn‚Äôt look at me.
 I felt something boil deep within me-the anger at him.
 We were his best friends, we told each other everything and now he was keeping something from us.

It was quiet, harder to fight the thoughts that were trying to creep in.
 I began to run songs through my head for distraction, mangling the lyrics and humming through the parts I couldn‚Äôt remember at all.
 My fingers tapped soundlessly into the dirt, until a flicker of movement just outside stopped me.
 I held my breath for what I was sure was impending, and painful, death, and saw it again.
 I released the breath, which was not, in fact, my last.
 A soft white rabbit loped in front of the bushes I‚Äôd posted for a doorway.
 My stomach was interested, but I‚Äôd never prepared meat.
 I‚Äôd only ever gathered berries and vegetables that someone else had grown.
 I didn‚Äôt have the first idea how to make a bow, let alone shoot one, and I‚Äôd never killed anything.
 Except plants.

"If I ever do anything that hurts you or that you don't like, tell me, and I'll stop.
 Right away.
 I care about you, Marie, and I'd rather never kiss you again than hurt you."
 She laid her head on his shoulder again.
 She believed him.

 "How does the airplane get in the air?"
 They were on the plane waiting for takeoff.
 Marie was in a window seat, squeezing Rick's hand as she looked out the window.
 "The plane goes really fast down the runway until the air lifts it."

Harruq nodded, shivering as he felt the tip of the blade rubbing against the tender skin of his throat.
 ‚ÄúGood.
 Pleasant days, half-orc.
 May Celestia watch over you‚Ä¶‚Äåand condemn your actions to death.‚Äù
 The biting tip left his throat, the blades in the bow retracted, and then the elf vanished.
 Harruq struggled to his feet, clutching his neck as he gasped for air.
 ‚ÄúDamn elf,‚Äù he cursed.
 ‚ÄúHow dare you threaten us.‚Äù
 His hands shook violently as his adrenaline faded.
 He had been terrified, convinced the elf would kill him, yet he didn‚Äôt.

Only after, though.

 Velixar nodded although he appeared not to listen.
 Instead, his eyes burrowed into Harruq‚Äôs, prying information not from his mouth but from his very soul.
 ‚ÄúTell me, Harruq, why do you mourn the lives of those you kill?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt,‚Äù Harruq said.
 He wasn‚Äôt sure if it was lie or truth, most likely a lie.
 ‚ÄúWar is brutal.
 Life is brutal.‚Äù Velixar put a cold hand against Harruq‚Äôs face.

"I think you meant to ask what I am."
 Alec sighed, but it wasn't an angry sigh, so I nodded, forgetting for a moment that he couldn't see me in the darkness.
 "We share a little in common with a bunch of different legends, but none get it quite right.
 In short, we're shape shifters, people who can take the form of animals."
 I'd already seen that for myself, but it was strangely exhilarating to hear him admit it.
 "You mean like werewolves?"
 There was a hiss of sound, as if I'd just hit him.
 For a second I worried I'd made him angry.
 "No, not like werewolves."
 I waited for him to elaborate.

Anvil was winded, though the strike wasn‚Äôt as severe as his previous show.
 Steed would unquestionably be the winner now and as he took aim to retaliate, his opponent raised his hands in surrender.
 ‚ÄúQuick thinking, Mister Summit.‚Äù The large man grinned and I was in no doubt they were old friends.
 Chevelle stepped forward then, eager.
 I had a feeling he‚Äôd been itching for this the way I‚Äôd been itching to burn Ruby.
 Steed smiled in acceptance, but not the same smile he‚Äôd given his last opponent.
 They stood across from each other and readied themselves.
 Both tensed but neither took the low, wide stance previously used.
 As their eyes fixed on one another, I felt myself, and Ruby beside me, lean forward in anticipation of action.
 Both men went taut, their muscles corded, jaws clenched tight, determined stares focusing only on each other.

Not that his statement did not have a hint of truth to it.
 Rodregas was sure everyone here had lost a loved one, at some point, to an Immortalist.
 But, no Paladin of the Gods had ever come to their rescue.
 The truth was that even if one of the gods was backing Rodregas, it was more likely to be some god who was pissed off at the Immortalists; one looking for a chosen champion for their own selfish reasons.
 As a child Rodregas had dreamed of being such a champion, but Paladin‚Äôs were always chosen from the ranks of the Order of the Soaring Heavens, and while Rodregas had once served the Order as a squire he had never came close to achieving knighthood.
 ‚ÄúAll right, Sir Paladin, I have to admit I have talked to the Sorcerer Ravenhurr a few too many times, and you definitely don‚Äôt seem to be him.
 Nevertheless, we are taking your wagon and your supplies.
 We will let you go in peace in the morning,‚Äù said Audrian in that tone of voice that implied that he just expected people to follow his orders.
 ‚ÄúHand over the shorts swords,‚Äù Audrian continued, gesturing at the two blades that Rodregas had yet to pull.
 ‚ÄúWe will return one in the morning.‚Äù Rodregas smiled and nodded and pulled the two swords out simultaneously.

He was a good fifty yards farther as I considered.
 My feet were moving before I‚Äôd actually decided to follow him.
 My determination faltered.
 How far should I go?
 What if he wasn‚Äôt going to find Junnie?
 And then I thought, What else do you have to do, sit here and blow up frogs?
 It was all the convincing I needed.
 Slinking out from the branches of the spruce, I crept low along the trees and brush as I followed my watcher north.

While the bed was normal enough, the walls of the room were strange and seemed to be made of woven branches and some sort of hide or dark canvas pulled between tree branches to form an oval shape.
 ‚ÄúDoi‚Äôvan and Imeralda, do they live?‚Äù he got the words out, though it hurt his throat to speak.
 ‚ÄúOh, yes, Imeralda is fine,‚Äù the Nymph healer responded.
 ‚ÄúShe was not hurt at all.
 Doi‚Äôvan was injured pretty badly, but not as badly as you are.
 You both should be dead from your wounds several times over.
 I thought at first you both had a sigil of healing, that would be the only way for you two to be alive, but Imeralda says that you are both ‚Äòof the blood.‚Äô You are a lucky man, even with your blood, to be alive.‚Äù ‚ÄúMay I speak to them?‚Äù Rodregas asked as he looked around the room or tent.
 He was amazed that somehow they had found a safe place to recover from the battle.
 ‚ÄúOf course, but let‚Äôs get something just a bit more hardy in you and maybe we can move you around a bit.
 Your body has sat still too long.

We are now at an historic crossroads: one path leads us back to a static, unstable and exclusive competitive security paradigm; the other leads to a far more stable and dynamic cooperative security paradigm inclusive of all nations and responsive to future needs and challenges.
 A global cooperative security system is needed that seeks to strengthen national security without increasing the insecurity of other states.
 It should be based on the fundamental principle that force will no longer be tolerated by the international community as a legitimate instrument of national policy.
 World Army
 The limitations of the competitive security system have given rise to numerous calls for the establishment of various types of standing international military force.
 The role of UN peace-keeping forces has been expanded dramatically in recent years to maintain peace in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
 At the same time, the scope of its activities has been enlarged to include limited forms of peace making as well ‚Äì disarming guerrillas, conducting elections and enforcing human rights.
 Article 42 of the UN Charter also empowers the Security Council to take direct military action where necessary to maintain or restore peace and guarantee international security.
 Article 43 pledges member states to make armed forces available to the Security Council, not only on an ad hoc basis but also as a permanent standing military force.
 This provision has never been activated due to the intervention of the Cold War.

You said last night that your life felt meaningless before I came here, well, mine was even worse.
 The only thing that's kept me sane has been your behind-the-scenes help.
 I want to stay with you.
 I want to be with you."
 Alec studied me for a moment longer, and then nodded, a short, choppy motion with little if any of his usual grace.
 "Very well then.
 It's just after ten o'clock.
 Your mom is about to pull into the driveway.
 Do your best to convince her you spent the night safely at home.
 We'll stay here and watch over the two of you.

He pushed his combatant back with some hard swings.
 Rodregas swung his shield aggressively, he hit the man‚Äôs sword with his shield and then banged the other man‚Äôs shield hard.
 Rodregas‚Äô goal was to see if he could out muscle the man while staying protected by the shield.
 It worked!
 Clearly his opponent, though set for a heavy blow, was not expecting the strength of Rodregas‚Äô bash.
 Still his opponent was too good to fall, even when surprised.
 And even as he half fell backwards he used the momentum to slide down and try to land a blow low under the shield.
 Rodregas had both quickness and strength on his side.
 He blocked the blow with his sword and then bashed down quick and hard multiple times with his shield.
 He thought he heard a bone break.

‚ÄúFirst, who is your brother?
 Second, since when are you elvish?‚Äù
 The half-orc chuckled, but still kept his eyes downward.
 ‚ÄúOur mum was an orc.
 Dad was an elf.
 Never met dad, and mum sold Qurrah and me when we were both little.
 I ran away and lived on the streets of Veldaren.
 Found Qurrah about a year or two later, hiding in the streets after he escaped his master.

A small knothole made a window in the wall across from me and some light from the cloudy day occasionally came through, putting Chevelle‚Äôs face in shade.
 I had been right; his eyes appeared nearly black in the shadows.
 I leaned forward, listening to him as a small gray bird landed on the lip of the knothole.
 ‚ÄúCheep.‚Äù Not many animals feared the elves.
 It even seemed curious as to what we were doing.
 ‚ÄúCheep, cheep.‚Äù I winced at the annoying chirps, working to focus on Chevelle‚Äôs story.
 ‚ÄúCheep, cheep, cheep.‚Äù My teeth gritted, but I could not block out the irritating sound.
 It broke into a melody that pierced my ears and I barely restrained the growl of frustration as I cursed the devil thing.
 That was when I heard the hollow thud of its body smacking the floor.
 I jerked upright.

 Her lock finally clicked and she stood up.
 The boys were walking side by side towards the play set.
 It wasn‚Äôt actually that small but it looked that way from the street.
 There were six swings and a tower with four slides attached to it.
 I ran after them with Emily right behind me.
 I slowed down next to Jason and put my arm on his shoulder.
 ‚ÄúHey Jason, do you know Seth‚Äôs a liar?‚Äù I asked and Seth shot me a bad look.

The growing demand for services in the developed world coupled with rapid strides in telecommunications has created the possibility of skipping steps to abridge the development process.
 Even within developing countries, surging demand for education, health care, tourism, communication, financial and retail services has opened up opportunities that were available to the developed countries only at a much later stage in their development.
 Outsourcing: During the last decade enormous attention has been focused on the lucrative employment potentials generated by Information and Communication Technology (ICT), particularly the high paid jobs in computer software and hardware and the less technical jobs in business process outsourcing.
 Countries such as India have shown that they can leapfrog into the technological vanguard by developing qualified human resources to meet the ever-expanding shortage in these sectors.
 Information Technology and IT-enabled services stand out as the most important new fields of employment to emerge since the popularization of the automobile.
 While the Commission‚Äôs report anticipated the importance of the information superhighway even before the World Wide Web radically transformed global communications, information exchange and commerce, ICPF did not foresee the dramatic impact that the Internet would have on the future export of service jobs to developing countries.
 The West has been exporting manufacturing jobs in large numbers for half a century, fuelling the growth of Japan, the East Asia tigers, and more recently China; but until the emergence of the information superhighway, the scope for export of service jobs was limited.
 Technological development has changed that.
 As a result, business process outsourcing has become one of the fastest growing sectors of the world economy.
 As growth of the labour force slows in high-income countries, there will be increasing pressure for export of service jobs.

‚ÄúI need to retrieve the swords I dropped,‚Äù Harruq said quietly.

 ‚ÄúYes, brother?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWhat we did‚Ä¶‚Äåis it‚Ä¶‚Äù
 ‚ÄúDid you revel in the power granted to you?‚Äù Qurrah asked.
 Harruq paused, searching for an honest answer.

 "She's really nice.

 He waited for her to add, "If I'm still here."

 "OK.  You probably won't be so nervous about it next time."
 She smiled, joining him on the sofa.
 "I might even use garlic again.
 But I have to admit that I sneaked upstairs to brush my teeth after we ate."

 His eyes lingered on my mouth for a moment and then met mine, piercing.

 I sat, blank-faced, staring back at him, and he turned to Ruby to give her the strangest look.
 ‚ÄúA hawk?‚Äù She appeared abashed for a moment and then simply shrugged, smiling.

Brandon seemed content to leave me alone with my thoughts as he sped around the various turns at speeds that normally would've made me protest.
 As I went to leave the car, he grabbed me by my back pocket, which nearly made me shriek in surprise.
 "Hey, you know what you need to put all this in perspective?"
 "No, but then I think it's more than just a matter of my perspective being off."
 My fear of alienating him had almost vanished in the rush of indignation over how he'd grabbed me.
 I wanted to say something even more snarky, but there was just enough worry left to curb my tongue.
 Mostly.
 "You need to come to the party Friday night."
 "You mean the monthly kegger?"
 Brandon shook his head, still flashing the grin that made it almost impossible to remain mad at him.

 He rubbed his eyes, still feeling groggy.
 ‚ÄúWhy do you ask?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúBecause he has rejected us, my disciple,‚Äù Velixar said.
 ‚ÄúHis strength has left him.
 My heart burns with this betrayal, and I must know who to punish.‚Äù
 Qurrah felt ill at ease.
 All around him, the sea of undead swayed and moaned as if they shared their master‚Äôs anger.
 ‚ÄúPerhaps it is a mistake,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúOr he has done so only to keep himself safe.

Rachel seemed relatively unfazed by the idea of bodyguards, but I wasn't especially excited about yet another point of difference between me and everyone else.
 Still, school was both better and worse than expected.
 As Alec had intimated, the day started out with a trip to the office.
 Not just me, not even just me and Alec.
 The entire pack trooped into the room, filling it with impeccably dressed, mostly gorgeous, shape shifters, who gave off a perceptible tingle of energy if you knew what to look for.
 I'd really thought Alec was tilting at windmills right up until he politely, but firmly asked for a brief meeting with the principal and was ushered into the other man's office five seconds later.
 Alec drew the blinds, which didn't do anything to muffle the principal's raised voice.
 Fifteen minutes later, after the unmistakable feeling of Alec's power had crested to the point where it almost felt like there was a breeze blowing from the office, we were all sitting down with the bewildered school counselor and playing musical classes.
 Only it turned out Rachel and I were the only ones not changing our schedules.
 I started to protest being treated differently than everyone else, only to feel my mouth click shut as Rachel shook her head at me.

It turned out to be a complete waste of time.
 Nobody asked me to dance and his lessons wouldn't have helped even if they had.
 Still, now I wish I'd done a better job of learning."
 Alec nodded, but there was a distracted air to the gesture.
 I waited while we made another quarter of a journey, him gracefully, me not quite so much, around the floor, before opening my mouth to speak, but he beat me to it.
 "I don't suppose either of us talk about our dads much.
 I'm not pushing, but if you ever need to talk about him, about what happened, I'll listen.
 I'll even try to suppress the natural male instinct to present advice or solutions."
 I missed another step, but I wasn't fighting off a panic attack, I was just shocked that his words hadn't triggered one.
 Maybe it was just a function of the simple passage of time, but that didn't feel like the right answer.

We walked to Alec's car in silence, the pair of them apparently lost in their own thoughts, and me wondering why Alec had agreed to give me a ride home.
 I wasn't enough of a car aficionado to recognize the vehicle other than the fact that it was a matte gray and had the kind of smooth, exotic lines all of the high-end vehicles seemed to be striving for right now.
 Rachel slipped in the backseat while I was still wondering how this seemingly low-profile ride matched up against Brandon's Mustang.
 "Did you enter the drawing for Les Mis√©rables tickets?"
 I looked over to find Rachel sitting in the middle of the seat, happily leaning forward so she could talk to us.
 "Yes, but so did everyone else.
 My chances are so dismal they're not even worth mentioning."
 Rachel looked like she was going to argue, or say something cheerful, but the back of my mind had been trying to figure out how she could be even with us, but still sitting in the back seat.
 I did a quick check to verify my suspicion.
 "Rachel, you should be wearing your seatbelt."

A boy that cute wasn't nice to a girl like me unless he wanted something from her.
 Mrs. Campbell walked over while I was casing the room.
 She still looked stern, but her face had relaxed slightly.
 She even smiled as she handed me a green, laminated card.
 "You'll need to pick out an empty table, we don't let students share here.
 Also I'd recommend choosing one somewhat distant from Ms. Samuels, she doesn't need any more distractions than she already has.
 When you have a question, or need help from one of the tutors, flip the card over to the red side and place it on your desk."
 I nodded and headed over to a table near the girl, one where I could watch her without her seeing me.
 I wasn't going to fall all over myself to become her friend or anything, but I figured it was worth observing her for a little bit.
 If she really was cool then we might strike up a friendship at some point.

‚ÄúDamn it,‚Äù Qurrah said, wincing as he touched the cut on his back.
 It was wide but not deep.
 Painful too, he noticed as he took a few steps.
 Furious, he turned back to the corpse of the drunken man and smashed a fist against its chest.
 The body shriveled into dust, only the bones remaining.
 ‚ÄúHalt!‚Äù shouted a voice from far down the street.
 Qurrah glimpsed an elf carrying a bow.
 Just one, the half-orc noticed, but that would quickly change.
 ‚ÄúPerhaps you‚Äôll have some use after all,‚Äù Qurrah said to the bones.
 He whispered words of magic as the elf took a few steps closer and notched an arrow.

‚ÄúRough night?‚Äù Aurelia asked.
 She blinked as a tingle in her head insisted that something was different about the half-orc.
 After a few seconds, she saw it.
 ‚ÄúHarruq,‚Äù she asked, ‚Äúis it me, or did you grow thirty pounds of muscle overnight?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYup,‚Äù Harruq muttered.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm magical like that.‚Äù
 The elf glared at him.
 ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù he said, his face reddening.
 ‚ÄúI had a long night.‚Äù
 Aurelia nodded.

I was mercifully spared from seeing the wreckage left when Brandon's wolves moved on, but there was no doubt in my mind that Donovan was dead.
 Screams, distant enough that they had to be coming from the other wing of the house, reached out and pierced my heart.
 There wasn't any way to be sure whether or not it was Rachel or her mother, but ultimately it didn't really matter.
 Brandon was going to kill all of us.
 Another door caved in under a blow from Brandon's fist, and I suddenly realized that he was now standing in the Lilac Room.
 "Spread out and find her."
 The words were nearly unintelligible, coming as they did from a throat that shared little in common with Homo sapiens, but the venom behind them was unmistakable.
 I fled the bed where I'd been studying, and hid in Alec's studio, but I could hear them getting closer, the dissident melody of growls, howls, and destruction growing stronger as they rampaged through the house.
 Terror stretched time out, but even so it felt as though only seconds had passed before I felt Brandon enter Alec's suite.
 I crouched frozen on the floor as my death crept ever closer.

He towered over his brother, his hands beefy and arms muscular.
 Nothing should scare him.
 He was supposed to be Qurrah‚Äôs protector, not the other way around.
 ‚ÄúWhere can we climb?‚Äù Harruq asked, hoping to get his mind off the skulls.
 ‚ÄúThere,‚Äù Qurrah pointed.
 A narrow set of stairs climbed to the parapet and Harruq led the way.
 The city gates were lost in the distance, city guards clustered about them.
 ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù Harruq said.
 ‚ÄúOrcs.‚Äù
 He spoke the word with an odd reverence, but they both understood its significance.

 It was just a key to the door.

 this was nothing like Davis's kisses.
 Rick's kiss was making her tremble.
 She returned it briefly and then pulled away, hiding her face against his shoulder in confusion.
 How could she like Rick's kiss more than Davis'?
 How could his kiss make her feel so hot and weak?
 Rick drew in a shaky breath, laying his cheek against her hair.
 That one small, hesitant kiss had been so exciting that he knew he'd be lost if she ever kissed him the way he wanted.
 And he knew himself well enough and was honest enough to admit that it wasn't just because she was beautiful and sexy.

How would she get back?
 Was she stuck here?
 Her parents must be out of their minds with fear.
 And Davis--he was probably tearing the city apart looking for her.
 Or would after he'd finished work for the day.
 Now where had that uncharitable thought come from?
 Davis loved her.
 And she adored him.
 If she couldn't find a way back, she'd never see him again.
 He'd marry somebody else.

"Are all of you shape shifters such showoffs?
 At least the change in altitude should bother you a little."
 Alec smiled as he came to a stop at the very top and set me down.
 I waited for a couple of seconds for him to respond and then shrugged and looked out over the arid, Southern Utah landscape.
 The view literally took my breath away.
 I hadn't realized we were quite so close to Zion National Park with all of its incredible greenery.
 The stark contrast between the desert and the lush vegetation was striking.
 "Not a show off, just really eager to get you up here so I could watch your face when you first saw all of this."
 Alec had unzipped his backpack and started emptying it while he spoke.
 Working with his usual speed it was only seconds before he had a blanket laid out.

Rodregas was pretty sure this match would decide who got the yellow first place ribbon and who would get the white.
 If Rodregas won it would give him ten total points after three competitions.
 It would give Karun twelve points if she once more came in second.
 If he lost, it would be much harder.
 Karun would have thirteen and he would have nine points.
 He was not sure how Geriodon or Nordien or the other leading contestants were doing.
 At the bell the two started to circle.
 Karun was a large woman.
 She was tall and unusually muscular.
 She moved with an easy cat-like grace and was attractive, in an about to kick your ass sort of way.

He did as commanded, and that fact disturbed him greatly.
 Qurrah was awake when he returned.
 ‚ÄúWhere have you been?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúI went out to train,‚Äù Harruq said.
 ‚ÄúWithout them?‚Äù Qurrah pointed to Harruq‚Äôs swords stacked in the corner.
 The larger half-orc shrugged.
 ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt need them.‚Äù
 Harruq went to the other side of the house and started punching holes in the walls.
 Qurrah might have inquired further but he was lost in his own secret.
 The night didn‚Äôt come soon enough for either of the two brothers.

 Marie and I are going to spend three weeks there, and Jefferson and John will drive out on the weekends.
 You could come with them."
 Marie had been looking forward to going to the Cape, but listening to her mother talk about it, she wasn't so sure she was up to going.
 She needed the familiarity of home.
 She went up to her room soon after Tom left.
 She hadn't bought a stuffed animal for Rick's t-shirt, so she spread the shirt over a pillow.
 After she'd changed into a nightgown, she clutched his handkerchief in her fist and sat down in the rocking chair by her bed.
 She wished she'd gone to the library today--she'd like to have something to occupy her mind.
 She-- There was a tap at her door.

‚ÄúStay on the root,‚Äù she warned him.
 ‚ÄúYou cannot take one of the blessings off the tree; it will wither and die if you try.‚Äù She winked at Rodregas as she said this.
 Imeralda then proceeded to eat the acorn shaped fruit; it took some work.
 It seemed to be a bit harder than any ripe fruit Rodregas knew of, but he followed her example and found that while it was tart it was amazing.
 It tasted of... Rodregas did not know what to call the flavor; the words that came to mind were sunlight and rain and the smell of a forest at night.
 When Rodregas finished the fruit completely he felt more whole but was also sad that it was gone.
 Imeralda seemed in great humor.
 ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù she said.
 She dropped to her hands on the edge of the branch and then dropped down as if she was only feet from the ground which, strangely she was.
 Rodregas saw her standing on the ground.

She lay there for a few more minutes, but she was too restless to keep lying still, especially with no one to talk to.
 So at last she jumped up and ran into the waves.
 Rick woke up slowly with no idea of how long he'd been asleep.
 It had been an exhausting week, and he'd gotten less sleep than usual.
 Of course, he'd had much more fun than usual too, he thought with a lazy smile.
 He turned to see if Marie was asleep.
 She wasn't there!
 Springing to his feet, he looked around.
 The beach had become crowded while he was asleep, and he didn't see her anywhere.
 "Marie!"

They all stopped in front of us, all those pairs of angry eyes staring at us.
 They made me confused, from the warm feeling the Frost Beasts gave me to the cold feeling the Thrashers inflicted.
 They exchanged some sort of signal, including grunts and yips, and slowly advanced on us.
 The dogs stalked toward the four of us looking like a animals about to attack their prey.
 The cute look was gone and all that was left was hunger.
 The dog nearest to me jumped at my chest and landed on my stomach.
 I managed to push it down before it breathed on me.
 My legs froze in place.
 ‚ÄúEmily I need some defrost.‚Äù I called to her as the cold seeped through my pants and bit at my skin.
 Emily turned her head and was about to reply when the dog caught her robe.

It wouldn‚Äôt take long to down the closer soldier, provided the archer wasn‚Äôt too good a shot.
 Even then, he risked at least two arrows sticking in his flesh.
 Unsure of what to do, he played dumb and let the first soldier approach.
 ‚ÄúCareful, he‚Äôs a biggie,‚Äù the bowman said.
 ‚ÄúNothing I can‚Äôt handle,‚Äù said the other before smashing the butt of his sword into Harruq‚Äôs face.
 Rage surged through the half-orc‚Äôs veins, his orcish side screaming for blood.
 He fought it down even as a mailed fist smashed against his spine.
 Harruq collapsed to his knees, choking down a furious roar.
 ‚ÄúGoes down easy, I say,‚Äù the guard said to the bowman.

I hardly even blushed at the inevitable giggles.
 I made a mental note to find out from Britney if I'd caught his question on the second or third repetition, but I rather suspected I'd forget.
 In fact, when class finally got out I remembered my question, but just didn't feel like asking.
 Instead, I just wanted to get away from her and the never-ending gossip.
 I waited until she stopped to talk to one of the cheerleaders about who was dating who, and then mumbled something about the bathroom, and made a break for it.
 Not wanting to out-and-out lie, I ducked into the nearest restroom.
 It was empty except for a mousy brunette I'd only seen a couple of times before.
 I smiled and started to open my mouth to say hi, but thought better of it.
 This was Sanctuary.
 She wasn't going to acknowledge the new girl was even breathing, let alone sentient.

‚ÄúAt least they are all slavers.‚Äù Rodregas thought.
 Rodregas scooted back and said, ‚ÄúBack to back.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan gave a grunt of acknowledgement, and they faced in opposite directions.
 They were quickly surrounded.
 Another final Immortal Guard stepped into the circle, increasing the odds against them.
 Both had long swords and small shields and were dressed in the Mithril and Night Bronze half plate of the regular guard.
 The four slavers had mismatched armor; two had short swords and there was one each with an axe and a mace.
 The men circled them, but did not seem eager to move in.
 During the pause Doi‚Äôvan spoke in a low growl, ‚ÄúAll this, and can you believe there is not a decent sized Immortal Guard in the lot.
 When we finish with them I will never fit in that armor.‚Äù Rodregas smiled at the disgust in the Hellborn‚Äôs tone and the confidence that it implied.
 ‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù Rodregas replied, ‚Äúbut it is pretty.

The trees I'd been listening to were exactly where I expected them to be, but it took me several heartbeats to recognize them.
 Gone were the sturdy, brown behemoths I'd spent so much time climbing with Cindi.
 Instead, pillars of soft light reached up to the sky, swaying slowly back and forth with the wind, creaking in a rhythm I'd known by heart since I was seven.
 I felt tears collecting in the corners of my eyes as I reached out and touched the nearest tree.
 It was as if the world I'd known my entire life had been simply a moldy cover designed to hide the true nature of my surroundings.
 Now the mask was gone and I was immersed in vivid colors, living lights, and a sense of harmony so strong it nearly overwhelmed me.
 It was impossible to say for certain how long I sat looking at the gentle motion of the tree branches, marveling at the way things made up of light could still cast shadows when silhouetted by the harsher light of the sun.
 Only somehow the sun had disappeared, replaced by the paler, colder light of the moon.
 The trees were still graceful strands of light, but the breeze had changed to a harsh thing, one carrying new scents that somehow represented danger.
 Something inside me forced my limbs into motion.

Rodregas slammed the door closed and relocked it.
 Then he quickly reached down and covered Korin‚Äôs mouth, pulled him up, and slipped behind him.
 Rodregas saw Korin‚Äôs bulging eyes as he tried to get a better look at his captor.
 Korin struggled but not as if his life depended on it.
 He was probably confused.
 The image of the day that Rodregas had started to hate him came back.
 A family of AElves had been taken prisoner; they were just common AElves with no real magic.
 Korin was interested in the father, a good-looking man.
 The wife was equally beautiful and they had a slim child named Jorin.
 Rodregas had taken Jorin under his wing.

We have as much choice in that as we have in who our parents would be.
 We might as well be discussing when and where we were born.
 Johnny ‚Äì Why are we talking about this?
 Jim ‚Äì Why not?
 Johnny ‚Äì Because it‚Äôs depressing.
 Eugene ‚Äì Do you have something you‚Äôd rather talk about that isn‚Äôt depressing?
 Jim - This ought to be good.
 Johnny ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know, I guess I‚Äôd like to talk about breasts.
 Eugene ‚Äì What kind of breasts?
 Johnny ‚Äì You know.

Second, every possible step must be taken to provide education for female children, an essential requirement for social equity and quality of life improvement.
 Nearly two-thirds of the world‚Äôs illiterate are women.
 In the poorest developing countries, literacy rates among females are 40 per cent below rates for males and the average number of years of schooling for females is 60 per cent lower.
 But perceptible progress has been made.
 Between 1980 and 1990, female primary school enrolment rose from 44 per cent to 47 per cent of total enrolment, although it actually declined in the Arab states and remained virtually unchanged in South Asia.
 Uneducated females represent a huge reservoir of untapped human potential that must be given every opportunity and full assistance to develop their innate capacities.
 This will call for accelerated efforts to establish cr√®che and child-care facilities, abolish child labour, and remove gender bias from text books and educational institutions.
 The cost of raising female educational levels up to that of males worldwide has been estimated at $2.5 billion, a small amount for an initiative that could have such wide-ranging benefits.
 Third, literacy must be complemented by techniracy, education that imparts basic technical information and skills to the population through a variety of teaching methods suited to the educational level of the recipients.
 Detailed recommendations are presented in the next section of this chapter.

 Some of your work hints at it‚Äîbut it‚Äôs subtext, it‚Äôs buried.
 BG: 	Lately, for whatever reasons, I have been thinking more about the spiritual side of the human animal than ever I have in my previous twenty-some year tenure on Spaceship Earth.

‚ÄúDamn,‚Äù he said quietly.
 He went to the middle where the door had been and was relieved when he was able to step through the invisible but open doorway.
 He felt nothing as he stepped through the illusion and quickly looked around the chamber for Imeralda.
 But she was nowhere to be seen.
 He ran to the base of the One Tree finding that it took longer to run from the door to the tree than he had expected.
 It was huge.
 He felt like he was approaching a mountain, not a tree.
 ‚ÄúImeralda!‚Äù he yelled.
 ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù Rodregas started to circle the tree, something that he quickly realized might take a while to accomplish.
 Then he saw her.

Jim ‚Äì He actually wanted to do that once.
 Art ‚Äì He didn‚Äôt do it did he?
 Jim ‚Äì Nah, Liz and I talked him out of it.
 Art ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt think reasoning with the boy would work.
 Jim ‚Äì It didn‚Äôt.

 Jim ‚Äì That crashing a wake for the food was something that Gene would do.
 Liz ‚Äì He didn‚Äôt take it that well.
 He moped for like two weeks after that.

We were riding through a small pass, the moonlight barely lighting our way, and Chevelle‚Äôs horse disappeared.
 My head swiveled, searching for any sign of them, and then my own horse turned beneath an overhang and stopped in a cavern so dark I hadn‚Äôt seen it until we were there.
 Chevelle tossed out a small flame, giving us enough light to dismount.
 The horses walked to one end of the cavern, their hoofbeats echoing softly, as we remained in the other.
 ‚ÄúFrey.‚Äù Chevelle turned to me as he spoke.
 ‚ÄúYesterday‚Ä¶ the council trackers‚Ä¶‚Äù Trackers?
 I tried to focus on what he was saying and not let my mind run wild with the new information.
 ‚ÄúThey will send someone for what I have done.‚Äù I thought of the councilman‚Äôs face, distorted in pain.
 ‚ÄúWe should continue your training.‚Äù ‚ÄúTraining?‚Äù Even I could hear the dread in my question.
 ‚ÄúPractice.

Art ‚Äì Yes I do have a quirky sense of humor.
 On this I‚Äôm quite serious my boy, I‚Äôve seen the way she looks at you.
 Jim ‚Äì And where did you gain the experience to gauge a woman‚Äôs affections from a look?
 Art ‚Äì Your mother used to look at me the same way.
 Jim ‚Äì Oh wonderful, mother looked at you the same way.
 Was that before or after she informed you that you ruined her life and were damned to spending an eternity in hell?
 If Liz is looking at me like that‚Ä¶Why am I still even alive?
 Maybe she‚Äôs coming up with some terrible forms of torture for me.
 Art ‚Äì It was when we first met, before she changed.
 That happened well before you were born smart-ass.

We had no other plans, so I suggested we visit the basketball game, since Karen‚Äôs wave and smile might revive my hope and cheer me.
 The game was against our team‚Äôs rival, Grossmont High School.
 My mother graduated there.
 The gym was ancient.
 The double entry doors each featured a quartet of small windows.
 When the gatekeeper refused to let us in because the tickets were sold out, Kenny‚Äôs usual good nature expired.
 He raised a fist as though to sock the gatekeeper, a boy in an ROTC costume.
 But instead of punching the kid, he drove his fist through one of the small windowpanes.
 The gatekeeper hollered.
 The next instant, we found ourselves surrounded by teachers, coaches, and a platoon of the ROTC.

‚ÄúThe Dire Bear must have been living in the cellar,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúI bet they actually had to go in and kill it there.
 We probably did not hear the battle because it was underground.
 They probably dragged it out after.
 It is said that Dire meat makes you strong.
 Not sure if that is true though.‚Äù His voice, in contrast to Imeralda‚Äôs, sounded completely normal.
 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you care that he did something so stupid?‚Äù asked Imeralda.
 ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan replied slowly, ‚Äúthe cats are obviously connected to him due to his Celestial lion essence.
 He freed them and now he has found a rich place for them to rear their young if they are pregnant from the mating.
 But with beasts like that, you are either in charge or you are game.

The next day, sometime around midmorning judging from the light coming in through the opening that seemed to function like a window, Imeralda entered along with a young handsome Nymph.
 He was tall with green hair and with a confident bearing to his presence.
 He greeted Rodregas with a very bright smile.
 ‚ÄúI see that you are looking much better,‚Äù said the unknown Nymph.
 Imeralda gave the young Nymph a big hug, one that looked far more intimate than Rodregas was comfortable with and she said, ‚ÄúRodregas, we are so lucky that I was able to get Jordaan to come.
 Durien was working so hard trying to heal you, but your body is so hard to work with.
 He says that the same innate magical ability that makes your body so strong also requires a lot of power to heal.
 Normally Durien can heal even a very seriously wounded person, but he could barely keep you and Doi‚Äôvan alive.
 I had to leave and run to Fariste to get Jordaan to come.‚Äù She was smiling like the sun as she spoke.
 ‚ÄúHe was so good to come and just leave at the last moment,‚Äù she added.

I stopped running.
 My heart pounded, the wind cutting against the damp sweat on my skin.
 I wanted to understand what had just happened, but I couldn‚Äôt process it.
 It was just too painful.
 I was confused, drained to the point of exhaustion.
 I had no way out.
 When they found me, I would have to surrender.
 I could see no other option.
 No one came.
 I wasn‚Äôt fool enough to go back voluntarily, but for some reason, they hadn‚Äôt followed.

The entire world, even God.
 It‚Äôs no real wonder why he‚Äôs so damn angry with us all.
 I just hope we can reach to him before he decides to get revenge on life for the lot he has been cast.
 I don‚Äôt know how I would try to reach him in your place.
 Just try.
 Jim ‚Äì As I said, I‚Äôll do what I can.
 But I think he‚Äôs going to either end up dead in an ally or in a psycho ward somewhere.
 He still hates mother with all his being.
 Art ‚Äì She really messed him up, but hopefully we can help him let go, and then heal.
 If we can‚Äôt help I‚Äôm afraid he might have to go see a psychiatrist.

She was approaching the house and I was alone.
 Part of me wondered if I was fast enough to get to my room before she came in.
 I hadn‚Äôt made up my mind before the door opened beside me.
 She purred.
 ‚ÄúWell, well.
 Alone, are we?‚Äù She smiled wickedly as she neared, coming uncomfortably close.
 ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk‚Ä¶‚Äù She leaned in further and something glistened in the air between us.
 I froze, unable to move away.
 ‚ÄúStop.‚Äù Chevelle‚Äôs voice was sharp as the redhead was whisked away from me, laughing.
 Her curls brushed my face on their way past, taking my head on a dizzying spin.

It was a more complex rhythm to the whole speaking‚Äîand I did just sort of speak the lyrics‚Äîthat was Jim.
 At first I wanted to sing it‚Äîyou know, I‚Äôd worked out a melody, a weird melody.
 And he said, on, I don‚Äôt know, the like 16th try, Jim said, shit, let‚Äôs not sing this one.
 Gimme a Lou Reed kind of thing.
 Half talk the damn story.
 I‚Äôm gonna use that melody behind you.
 And he did, man, he played what I was singing on a plastic tonette‚Äîno shit, that‚Äôs that weird, unearthly descant in the background, Jim on this little toy.
 It‚Äôs not in the credits, so you‚Äôre getting it first, right?
 And I just did my best Lou Reed impersonation, intoning, Her glances could break arms.
 Her hair was a nimbus of tangled nestings, life surrounded her like a cloak.

He then headed back to the dungeon, stopping at the chicken coop to let out the chickens.
 They quickly spread all over the yard.
 It would be better for the town folk who lived so close to the fort if the Dire Cats were not starving when they left.
 On his way into the dungeon, he left all the doors propped open so the way out would be clear, and he made sure that all the other doors were closed.
 Luckily, the kitchen drudge had locked herself in the kitchen quarters.
 Rodregas then went back to the dungeon level and opened the opposite door and then the Dire Cats‚Äô prison door and watched.
 He had expected them to either bolt for it or stay in the ‚Äúsafety‚Äù of their room.
 Instead they both casually got up and walked out, as if they were guests in a fancy inn, with all the time in the world.
 As they walked out the door both cats gave him a casual glance as he held the two doors firmly closed together bracing for the weight if they threw themselves at the doors, but they just walked by and headed up the stairs.
 He wanted to follow, but Rodregas held himself back patiently waiting until it was safe.

We stayed there for some time, a fact for which I was grateful.
 Even though whatever had happened seemed to have passed, neither man seemed in a hurry to go.
 Chevelle glanced at me occasionally but kept himself busy around the fire.
 Steed still played with his feather, eventually entertaining me with it.
 It spun toward me and turned down, tickling my arm and then my nose.
 I giggled despite my wariness, and reached up to rub my nose where the plume had brushed it.
 I noticed the map on my palms.
 ‚ÄúWhat about spells?‚Äù He eyed my hands.
 ‚ÄúBeen working spells?‚Äù ‚ÄúNot on purpose.‚Äù He smiled.
 ‚ÄúYes, spells can be dangerous.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I agreed, ‚Äúbut why do you need words for spells and not magic?‚Äù ‚ÄúA spell can be left, set with a trigger, or larger than your magic.

"Penny for your thoughts?"
 His smile was a half-hearted thing.
 "Mother is playing again.
 She just finished up with 'Courtship', so the next one will be 'Welcoming'."
 It was amazing how quickly I could forget his supernatural abilities.
 Most of the time he seemed so normal.
 If you could consider any gorgeous, well-built boy who happened to be interested in me normal.
 Every so often though he'd do something that should be impossible.
 Alec's smile was slightly apologetic.
 "Sorry about that.

Normally I would have just acquiesced, but I couldn't bear the thought of letting him leave, taking with him the identity of the only person besides my mom who really cared what happened to me.
 I tightened my grip in an attempt to stop him.
 "Please, if you won't tell me who it is, let me write a thank you note.
 I have to do something.
 He's done so much for us."
 He stopped partway through shaking his head.
 "I can't promise he'll even bother to read it, but I'll take it to him if you promise never to talk about this again.
 I don't want to hear even the slightest rumor anything unusual happened in association with this project."
 I nodded, relieved I'd have a chance to jot down a couple of lines, that I'd at least have that much of a link with our protector.
 Mayor Wilkenson waited at the door, almost the perfect picture of a gentleman at his leisure, but his desire to be done with this whole affair was almost palpable.

‚ÄúYou say I‚Äôm stubborn‚Äù I laughed and he continued, ‚ÄúListen, I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs true or not.

 He made a face, ‚ÄúJazell I really don‚Äôt know if I should say anything‚Ä¶‚Äù I interrupted him again, ‚ÄúSeth just give up trying to talk me into not listening.
 It‚Äôs a waste of breath.‚Äù I took my own stick and threw it at him.
 He ducked, of course, and it landed on the ground.
 ‚ÄúWhat if whatever you‚Äôre not telling us happens and we never knew?
 How would that help anyone?‚Äù He looked down and mumbled something that sounded like, ‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt help.‚Äù When he looked back up he said, ‚ÄúFine you win, I‚Äôll tell you.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt sound happy about it.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm waiting.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou know, when Emily asked for any warnings that we were given?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù I had a bad feeling where this was going.

It tasted of... Rodregas did not know what to call the flavor; the words that came to mind were sunlight and rain and the smell of a forest at night.
 When Rodregas finished the fruit completely he felt more whole but was also sad that it was gone.
 Imeralda seemed in great humor.
 ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù she said.
 She dropped to her hands on the edge of the branch and then dropped down as if she was only feet from the ground which, strangely she was.
 Rodregas saw her standing on the ground.
 It was not that she had floated down.
 It was as if she had she had been in a regular sized tree.
 She smiled and waved at him to follow her.
 Rodregas decided to follow her example.

I shouldn't have bothered rushing.
 I slipped into Spanish exactly three seconds before the late bell sounded, but Mrs. Tiggs wasn't even there.
 When she finally did show up, we had a surprise quiz on our vocabulary.
 Once we finished she turned on the television and told us to listen for conjugation.
 I almost wished I shared the class with Britney, her dad seemed like the type to get six kinds of riled up over something like that.
 He'd probably go straight to the school board and demand a new Spanish teacher altogether.
 It was a real relief when I was finally able to leave the drab little classroom.
 I stopped off at my locker before heading to the tutor room, but Britney was nowhere to be seen.
 Probably still mad.
 I mentally shrugged as I swapped out books, and set off.

Ruby grinned at me.
 ‚ÄúJust planning for the trip.‚Äù ‚ÄúTrip?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, you know, to the peak.‚Äù She was scheming.
 ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù I decided I‚Äôd let them work it out, heading instead to Ruby‚Äôs room.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to take a bath.‚Äù As I closed the door, Ruby said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to tell her.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt hear a response.
 I was soaking in hot water, my eyes closed, not even considering getting out when she knocked on the door.

 ‚ÄúHow did you know it was me?‚Äù No one else is that annoying.
 ‚ÄúCan I come in?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù The water streamed from the tub and out the back window.
 I swore.
 ‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôm getting dressed.‚Äù I dried off, gathering clothes from a pile I assumed was for me, too large for Ruby‚Äôs petite frame.

For some months after meeting Gloria at the San Onofre campground, I frequently drove to South Gate, just south of L.A., a hundred miles each way, to feast on her grandmother‚Äôs cooking, get scrutinized by her dad and brothers, take her to drive-in movies and smooch until her midnight curfew, then race home so fast the sleepy cops along Highway 101 failed to notice the blur as I passed.
 But Mexican dads like hers expect their girls‚Äô novios to marry or que se vayan a la fregada.
 Meaning scram.
 And after the second time I chose North Beach over her company, Gloria informed me her former boyfriend had returned on leave from the Marines.
 We shouted at each other long-distance and parted.
 Eric still didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend.
 I had decided he didn‚Äôt want to hurt dozens of girls by choosing another over them.
 Too soon, I would learn about other reasons.
 Girls adored him.
 They phoned at all hours, even risking Sylvia‚Äôs wrath, and they tailed him through the halls of our school.

Davis shook his future father-in-law's hand.
 "I love my daughter dearly, but she can be quite a handful.
 A lot of romantic notions in her head, you know.
 That's why I keep such a tight rein on her, and I advise you to do the same.
 Of course, I'm sure that once she's married, she'll settle down and realize that life isn't like those picture shows and books that fill her mind with wild ideas."
 "I'm sure you're right, sir."
 Davis had no intention of letting her get away with the things her father did.
 Of course, she had the old man fooled, but Davis wasn't so easily deceived.
 Marie could tell that something was in the air that day.
 Her father and Davis kept exchanging looks over lunch, and they didn't shoo her and her mother from the table right after lunch so that they could discuss business.

Her being an attention hog didn't justify me being petty though.
 I just nodded instead and packed up my stuff.
 The ride home was completely uneventful, and mercifully brief.
 Britney was one of those people who drive fast normally, and even faster when they are pissed off.
 Apparently having to stay after school to study merited twenty-five over the speed limit.
 I normally would have complained--I'd become much more sensitive about speeding in the last couple of months, but I was anxious to get home, and very much not feeling like there was anything particularly special to live for.
 Not that I was suicidal, contrary to Mom's unvoiced, but obvious fears.
 I just didn't have much of anything to look forward to.
 It wasn't until Britney's Saturn was nearly out of sight that I realized our Jeep Cherokee was parked in the driveway.
 I sometimes felt I should have outgrown the need to talk to Mom when things were tough, but I couldn't deny that it felt like a big weight had been lifted off me as I walked through the door.

Employment opportunities are directly linked to government tax policy concerning capital gains, depreciation, energy, wages and salaries, as well as by policies governing minimum wage laws, interest rates, budget deficits, imports and exports, environmental regulations and restrictions, defence spending, immigration, industrial development, investment, licensing of practitioners, zoning laws and countless other public policy issues.
 Without access to jobs, people lack the ability to ensure their own survival and support in modern society.
 As government has assured the right to education ‚Äì indeed, compels it ‚Äì it can and must also ensure the right of every person to gainful employment.
 Our very concept of the rights of the individual and the responsibilities of the society must undergo radical change.
 UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has called for a broader definition of human rights to include economic as well as political rights.
 The essential basis for meeting the world‚Äôs employment needs is the realization that employment is an absolute necessity for survival in modern society and must be recognized as a fundamental right of every human being.
 Pragmatism as well as idealism compels this step.
 Recognizing the right of every citizen to employment is the essential basis and the most effective strategy for generating the necessary political will to provide jobs for all.
 What is needed is not another job generation programme, but a change in social values that will accelerate the natural and inevitable evolution of society, from one in which labour is regarded as a dispensable resource to one based on full human rights and the enormous productive potential of the human being.
 The type and magnitude of change needed today is comparable to that embodied in President Roosevelt‚Äôs New Deal for the American people during the Great Depression, at a time when 25 per cent of the workforce was unemployed: to the Indian government‚Äôs decision to launch the Green Revolution in the mid-1960s to achieve self-sufficiency in foodgrains, at a time when the country was highly dependent on imported food to stave off famine: and to Mikhail Gorbachev‚Äôs initiatives late in the 1980s to end the Cold War and transform Soviet society.

 Eugene - Yes, I did some modeling.
 What‚Äôs so funny about that.

 ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said at last.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôve killed.‚Äù
 He eyed Aurelia, desperately wishing to know what she thought yet unable to figure out why he even cared.
 He thought he saw pity in her eyes, perhaps compassion.
 But there was a hardness there, a doubting that made him wonder just how much of him she truly knew.
 ‚ÄúTell me of the first time,‚Äù she said.
 He shook his head.
 ‚ÄúNot today.
 Maybe some other session, if I feel I can.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúYes, this will do,‚Äù she hummed with a sly grin.
 ‚ÄúLet me see‚Ä¶ yes, I‚Äôve got it.‚Äù She began stepping a slow circle around me, talking as she moved, suddenly cat-like.
 ‚ÄúThe dreams you had after the fairy dust, do you remember them?‚Äù Oh.
 ‚ÄúI have a few questions, you see.
 You had plenty to say about someone as you slept.
 You mentioned how his mouth tasted‚Ä¶ muscles under his shirt.

The locks clicked open, the lid raised, and then he reached inside and pulled out two swords sheathed in gleaming obsidian.
 ‚ÄúThese swords were once wielded by Aerland Shen.
 He led the elves that aided Karak in the great war against Ashhur.
 When Celestia cursed his kind, they shared his curse.‚Äù Velixar smiled at Harruq, his eyes gleaming.
 ‚ÄúLong have I waited for someone to wield these blades.
 An elf crafted and used them in battle, an elf cursed into an orc.
 These swords can only be held by one who has the blood of both inside him.‚Äù Velixar held the hilts out to Harruq, who drew one from its sheath.
 The sword‚Äôs blade was deep black and wreathed in a soft red glow.
 He weaved it through the air, his mouth agape at the ease in which it glided.
 ‚ÄúThey are not as long as your previous weapons,‚Äù Velixar said, ‚Äúbut you will adjust.

He gazed down into her eyes.
 "You loved me, and you were completely torn apart, yet you wanted to go home so badly that you left me.
 What happened?"
 Tears shimmered in her eyes.
 "I was miserable.
 I mean, I was really happy to see my family, and we felt closer than ever.
 They thought I'd been kidnapped at first, but when there was no ransom request, they were afraid I'd been murdered.
 They were out of their minds.
 When I walked back into our garden, I ran up to my parents' room.
 I thought my mother‚Äôs screams were going to bring the police.

Rodregas closed down on himself, ‚ÄúDuty,‚Äù he thought.
 ‚ÄúMy real duty this time, focus on the next step.
 I can do this.‚Äù As Rodregas raised the club, he kept his eyes away from the AElf maiden not wanting to give himself away to anyone watching.
 ‚ÄúGods,‚Äù Rodregas quietly prayed.
 ‚ÄúYou have never answered my prayers.
 I have never had much to give you as an offering of wealth to your temples, nor have I done great deeds in your names, but if any of you hate these life-stealing Immortalists as I do, then let me know your favor.‚Äù Rodregas could not help but add a selfish plea to his desperate prayer, ‚ÄúIf by your grace I live, then I promise you gods that I will make it my life‚Äôs duty to fight the Life Stealers.‚Äù Rodregas doubted his prayers would do any good, but if nothing else he was a practical man and when you are pushing the odds it never hurts to call in divine favor.
 Rodregas knew things would start moving quickly now.
 Ravenhurr had been preparing the circles for months, feeding them with unearthly energies.
 Ravenhurr had not wanted the prisoners up on the tower roof until the last moment, lest their fear lead them to take desperate action.
 Ravenhurr started to speak the final words of the spell, setting off months of careful preparations.

‚ÄúDo we march?‚Äù
 Antonil stared at the small town, seeing very little motion within.
 No people wandered the streets.
 No traveling merchants hawked their wares.
 He sighed and turned to Sergan, his trusted advisor in war.
 The man was old, scarred, and had dirty hair falling down to his shoulders.
 He had seen many wars, and the axe against his shoulder had claimed more than a few lives.
 ‚ÄúYes, let us end this, one way or the other,‚Äù Antonil said.
 ‚ÄúOrder them to march.

"So have I."
 "And if you were mine," he continued, happy that she wasn't angry, "I would hold you every time you let me.
 I guess that if I lived in 1927, I might have to be subtle about it.
 Like .

 .
 I might see some lint on your shirt that needed to be brushed off.
 Like this."
 He turned to face her and reached behind her to brush off the imaginary lint, his arm drawing her close.
 Marie laughed.

 The half-orc shrugged.
 ‚ÄúBetter than most.

 The elf looked him up and down, sending chills roaring along his spine.
 It seemed so strange that she had saved his life, since at that moment he felt like all she wanted was to see him dead.
 ‚ÄúCome tomorrow with swords to spar,‚Äù she said at last, tucking a few strands of hair behind her ear.
 ‚ÄúYou can train me to wield my staff in melee combat.‚Äù

He was obviously uncomfortable this morning, just like you'd expect from someone who was in the unenviable position of telling off a borderline psychopath.
 Everything I'd seen substantiated Brandon's explanation, but why would Jasmin become so enamored of someone so average-looking?
 Not only that, what were the odds Ben was one of the eight males in America who would decide they weren't interested in dating the most gorgeous girl on the planet, even if she was a nut case?
 I was still trying to sort out all the pieces when Brandon fished his cell phone out of a pocket and checked the time.
 In an amazing display of herd behavior, thirty seconds later his friends had all disappeared, and he was standing to leave.
 "We should do this more often.
 I'll see you tomorrow."
 The words were innocent enough, but there was something in his eyes that made a rush of warmth shoot through me.
 Britney was so excited she could hardly speak, but I was too excited myself to feel very superior.
 I floated through my next class, and would've gone through the rest of the day the same way, if I hadn't had to share a class with Alec.

Something about that last thought didn‚Äôt seem right, like it wasn‚Äôt mine, but I couldn‚Äôt follow it.
 The tracker screamed; it had reached his thigh.
 My eyes flicked open.
 The body of the snake made a lump under the skin of the tracker‚Äôs leg.
 His face was contorted in agony, but that wasn‚Äôt what had done it.
 It was the fear.
 He had cracked.
 Chevelle released the tracker‚Äôs hand long enough for the man to scribble a few words of a spell, not allowing him to speak or cast magic.
 He slumped after his surrender, confident the worst was over.
 I reached the sword tip back to his leg and made another incision to release the snake.

It was the sixties, and my mother was damaged goods in their eyes; she was vulnerable.
 We eventually moved out of my grandparents‚Äô home to an apartment in Los Angeles and then to a small rental house in Burbank that backed up to a military plant.
 Barrels of who-knows-what lined the side of our back fence.
 I guess the rent is cheaper when you live next to a toxic dump!
 We had a yard for our dogs and new friends to meet and we settled into this little house.
 My brother and I still shared a room, as we always had, and we still had each other despite another change in schools and friends.
 At dinner sometimes, Mom wouldn‚Äôt eat.
 She would say she wasn‚Äôt hungry or offer some excuse.
 I would later realize that she fed us first because she was so broke she couldn‚Äôt afford to feed herself.
 In all the years after the divorce, she had never received a dime in child support from my biological father, Richard.

It can never be exhausted.
 Developing the human resource should be the centrepiece of all development strategy.
 We can solve today‚Äôs most pressing problems if we adopt a total approach which takes into account all the interrelated factors ‚Äì political, economic, technological, social and environmental ‚Äì rather than relying on partial strategies.
 Partial remedies, however welcome or desirable, can always generate side-effects ‚Äì such as the increase in social tensions and violence observed when increasing political and social freedom are not matched by increasing economic opportunity, or the rise in unemployment and arms exports that accompany a reduction in defence expenditure.
 The success of the Green Revolution was due to its integration of technological, institutional, commercial and public policy measures, while its short comings arose from its failure to integrate environmental factors, which are now being incorporated in agricultural development strategies.
 Comprehensive measures can eliminate the side-effects of partial progress.
 The progress of the whole depends on the progress of all its parts.
 Humankind is infinitely enriched by the qualitative diversity of culture and individual expression, but it is immeasurably impoverished by the quantitative abyss which separates the more fortunate from the rest of humanity.
 The most prosperous levels of society cannot fully and finally rise to higher levels of accomplishment and enjoyment without first ensuring that the less fortunate and less productive are helped to obtain the full fruits of life at the present level of social achievement.
 Social equity, apart from its moral value, is an essential condition for continued progress.

He did his best to dodge, but he was far less mobile than his brother.
 The arrow pierced between his left shoulder and collarbone, burying the barbed tip deep in his flesh.
 The half-orc let out a stunned gasp.

She turned and threw her arms around him.
 She was in a party scene, one of six people that formed a group with the star.
 She wasn't supposed to do anything but smile and sip her drink, but when the star gave her a smoldering glance during rehearsal, the director decided he wanted to film it.
 The result was a split-second close-up of her face, and the star kissed her hand.
 Marie felt as if she were going to burst from excitement.
 They were allowed to watch filming until lunch, and then they were given a tour of the rest of the studio.
 Marie heard obscenities and shouting, and she saw two different actors storm off two different sets in the middle of their scenes.
 But it was wonderful.
 The actors and actresses were very attractive people, and many of them were nice to her.
 "Today was magic, absolute magic," Marie sighed as they ate steak and salad that evening.

Salvation swung around, ringing against the blade.
 Condemnation followed through, aimed straight for the guard‚Äôs throat.
 He ducked underneath the swing, feeling the air of the cut just inches above his head.
 Then he was up, both hands gripping his sword tightly.
 Harruq came charging in, both swords striking.
 The guard parried one after the other, constantly retreating.
 The others came to his aid, swinging careful, tentative blows.
 All three tried to engage without being put at risk, much like men prodding a bull.
 Of course, the result was similar.
 The bull got madder.

‚ÄúJason, try to hit its face,‚Äù he instructed.
 ‚ÄúEmily, knock it off balance.‚Äù ‚ÄúCan I skip while I do it?‚Äù Emily asked.
 He gritted his teeth.
 ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù He turned to me.
 ‚ÄúJazell, you‚Äôll aim for the belly while we hold it off.
 If you can‚Äôt get an arrow in before I can cut off the stinger, then I‚Äôll have to do it myself.‚Äù ‚ÄúFine boss dude,‚Äù I said with a snort.
 Seth ducked and charged the creature, his sword held out behind him.
 Jason flicked some knives into his wrist and flung them at the creature.
 Some hit their mark, which was signaled by the creature roaring out in pain, others fell into the dirt.
 Emily danced close to it, spinning fire from her fingertips.

There was almost no redeeming value to most of what she said, but it did have the benefit of being distracting.
 By the time lunch finally came around I needed some kind of distraction.
 This was my only chance to see Les Mis√©rables performed live before I turned forty.
 Unfortunately, while the conversation at Brandon's table was plentiful, it wasn't very distracting.
 I was quickly realizing that Brandon's friends weren't very nice.
 I'd pretty much known Cassie was a wench, but Vincent seemed even meaner.
 While a story about how someone tricked some poor girl into thinking he was going to ask her out was highly illuminating, it wasn't particularly the kind of thing I wanted to dwell on.
 Especially considering how many parallels there were between her story, and mine.
 I kept looking at the clock, and the later it got, the more certain I was that Principal Gossil was just about to get on the loudspeaker and call out the winners of the drawing.
 The last two minutes of lunch dragged on forever, but then the bell rang and I was left sitting stunned as Brandon and his friends stood to go.

The establishment of secure foundations for peace will be aided by development and post-conflict peace building.
 Yet if there is a growing international consensus on the peace operations undertaken by the United Nations, there is no such consensus on its developmental work.
 Indeed, this lack of a consensus reflects a worldwide crisis in the field of development economics.
 As development becomes imperative, as we approach the turn of this century, we are faced with the necessity of giving new meaning to the word.
 Reflecting on development is thus, in my opinion, the most important intellectual challenge of the coming years.
 Already, it seems clear that macro-economic growth can no longer be deemed sufficient for development purposes.
 Countries pursuing macro-economic growth paths have the necessary foundations for development, but that is only the first part.
 There can be no lasting development with the exclusion of social groups from the fruits of growth.
 Nor can there be long-term prospects for development when the environment is pillaged and the rights of future generations ignored.
 Finally, growth which is not accompanied by the improve ment of the social fabric of society will be only a hollow shell.

He went to the kitchen and set the pizza on the table.
 As he was filling glasses with ice, she padded into the kitchen.
 "Hi.
 I thought you'd be later."
 It was only 6:30.
 "So did I.
 But I hurried--I couldn't wait to get home."
 He smiled at her.
 "We need to add a bathrobe to our shopping list, don't we?"
 She was wearing his, obviously having just showered.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the elf said, turning around so he could stare at Qurrah eye to eye.
 ‚ÄúBut murderers do.‚Äù
 Neither moved.
 Neither spoke.
 Qurrah felt his nerves fray, and in his gut a sudden confusion swelled.
 He felt as if he hung over the side of a cliff, and the bones he held were the rope.
 The elf let go of his bow and held his hands out to either side.
 ‚ÄúNo more have to die,‚Äù the elf said.
 The flesh around his eyes sagged wearily, and he leaned against the window to aid in standing.
 It was as if grief had rendered him lifeless.

Smarter, too.‚Äù
 Harruq blushed.
 ‚ÄúNo need for lies,‚Äù he said.
 The elf laughed a little but said nothing.
 Instead, she walked over and gave Harruq a quick peck on the cheek.
 ‚ÄúKeep your big butt safe, okay?‚Äù she said.
 The half-orc tried to answer but his mouth refused to cooperate.
 Somehow, it seemed to have become unhinged.
 Besides, it wasn‚Äôt as if he could think of anything to say.
 All his mind could concentrate on was the feel of the elf‚Äôs soft lips on his cheek, the flowery scent of her perfume mixed with sweat, and the quick brush of her breasts against his arm.

That wasn't the kind of person who'd take advantage of my human weakness to seduce me.
 In fact, it was all too likely he was going to fight my every effort to bring us closer together precisely because he didn't want to take advantage of me.
 I was suddenly very certain though that I was going to wage that war.
 I couldn't not want him, not love him, any more than he could do less than his best to keep his family from harm.
 Chapter 28 Alec was completely drenched in sweat, and I still wanted to throw myself at him so badly my teeth hurt.
 It shouldn't be possible for someone to look so good dressed in what amounted to little more than loose, extra-stretchy sweatpants.
 "How was training?"
 It was hard to sound casual.
 The urge to kiss him had become almost overpowering in the last few days.
 He knew me better on every level imaginable than anyone outside my immediate family ever had, and all I could think about right now was how much I wanted to touch him.

But I was wrong.
 He told a friend of ours many months ago that I had made him happier than he'd ever been.
 "I know how hard it was between you.
 Perhaps when two complex people can't live with each other, it's because they need each other so much they hit head on.
 "I have been thinking how important it was for Eric to be free.
 God didn't make him for this world.
 God made Eric for a world someplace farther beyond our imaginations than any of us can comprehend.
 Someplace where he could run with the wind all day."
 Our friend Kenny Neidermeyer's mom was a Spanish teacher who also volunteered with a Tijuana charity.
 Since June, four of us had been riding with her to Tijuana every Sunday to play a double-header for a ball team the charity sponsored.

And then I saw him, the man in tattered clothes, hunched with his face in his hands.
 He heard me approach and raised his head, the awe all that was recognizable.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre back.‚Äù His voice was trembling, feeble.
 It was my Noble, young no more.
 He had been waiting here for my return.
 He was an outcast of the village; no one believed his tales of magic, the mysterious woman he claimed to meet here.
 He confessed to spending years trying to find me.
 He‚Äôd thought I was angry with him and that was why I‚Äôd not returned.
 He was afraid to leave this spot in case I were to change my mind, forgive him for whatever he‚Äôd done.
 I pushed the guilt aside when I recalled why I‚Äôd had to come here.

It always seemed like the kids who moved in partway through the year usually had some kind of instant in with the cool crowd, but that probably wouldn't happen for me.
 It wasn't that I didn't want to make friends; I just wasn't very good at it.
 My equilibrium seemed to have returned, so I took a few unsteady steps around to the back of the truck.
 If I didn't return with a box soon Mom would rush out expecting the worst.
 Unless she got caught up visualizing some new project, in which case it would be hours before she thought to come check on me.
 We'd moved the beds and most of the other heavy items in earlier, which helped explain my exhaustion, but that didn't make the pile of remaining items in the back of the truck any less foreboding.
 I decided to take the easy way out, and picked up a couple of blanket-wrapped mirrors.
 I didn't unwrap either of them.
 That was dangerous too.
 The face that'd look back out of the glass would look almost more like hers than mine.

The rock mountain ended in a sheer cliff, straight down into haze.
 He looked into my eyes like he saw something there, like he really knew me.
 We gazed out over the cliff, at the horizon‚Ä¶ endless.
 I felt his hand on my back and closed my eyes, relaxing into the comfortable, familiar feel of it.
 He pushed me with full force.
 I flew off the cliff, falling straight down.
 I stared back at him as he stood, watching me fall, nothing but open sky above and below.
 I couldn‚Äôt imagine why he‚Äôd throw me from the cliff, couldn‚Äôt think of the magic to stop myself, couldn‚Äôt see when I would crash into the base, the rocks below.
 My arms flailed as I jerked awake.
 The group stared at me.

The two stepped around the bodies of the slain as they headed east, leaving Velixar alone in the emptiness of Cornrows.
 ‚ÄúIncredible,‚Äù Velixar said when they were gone.

 The man in black smiled.
 ‚ÄúIf you didn‚Äôt know then I do not feel as blind,‚Äù he said.

 Brandon was still smiling, but I got the feeling that it was a little more forced.
 "Perfect.
 I'm going to go take care of some stuff then, but I'll see you both tomorrow."
 Mrs. Campbell looked up from the plant she was watering as we walked into the tutoring room.
 "Ah, there you two are.

 ‚ÄúHeavy, but well worth its weight in blood.

 Let us return to Woodhaven, for this place of death turns my mouth sour.‚Äù
 The two took to the air and joined the other survivors.
 They did not try to locate their dead among the hundreds of other rotting bodies.
 Instead, a few elves flew low and scattered firestones, small pebbles that burst into flame upon landing.
 Grass and bodies ignited, and the battlefield rapidly swelled into a giant funeral pyre.
 Qurrah crawled out from underneath the body as flames erupted all around him.

The pitch-black shadow that padded towards me was some kind of cross between a leopard and a jaguar.
 A low growl rippled up out of Alec's throat as the large cat got closer, but she dropped to the ground and rolled onto her back.
 I started forward, but Donovan's hand closed around my arm, pulling me up short.
 Alec's gaze never left the prostrate shape shifter.
 He let her remain on the ground for several seconds, and then his chin dropped in an unmistakable nod.
 Moving with what had to be exaggerated care for someone capable of such speed, she rolled back onto her paws and crossed the remaining distance between us.
 Donovan released my arm as she reared up and placed her front paws on my shoulders.
 The colorless eyes didn't match any of the pack's human form, but they had Dominic's gentleness.
 She dropped back down and butted her head against my hand.
 I started petting her out of reflex, but when I slowed down out of embarrassment, she butted my hand again.

She noticed the suitcases and the empty hangers for the first time.
 "Honey, there isn't any reason to be in such a hurry.
 We haven't really decided to take the job yet, and even if we do, I'm sure we won't be able to arrange a flight for another day or two."
 Right.
 If Alec really had arranged this incredible trip, literally overnight, he'd have her on a plane much faster than anyone else would've believed possible.
 "Mom, we've already gone through every single one of your objections, and they've all been taken care of.
 I'll be fine, the brochure will still be completed on schedule, and the job is as real as it gets.
 The only thing left to do is call them back and accept before they decide to offer it to someone else."
 It obviously hadn't crossed Mom's mind that they might decide to go with someone else.
 Waffling over whether or not to take the job was one thing when she was sure she'd have it in the end.

Harruq turned away.
 Perhaps his brother would think him weak, but he would not watch.
 He heard a sudden shriek of pain that morphed into a long, drawn-out moan.
 As the last of the air left the orc‚Äôs lungs, Harruq turned around, startled by the sight.
 ‚ÄúBeauty in all things,‚Äù Qurrah said, purple light dancing across his face.
 ‚ÄúEspecially those things that are controlled.‚Äù
 An orb floated above his open palm, seemingly made of thick, violet smoke.
 Within its center, a face shifted, its sunken eyes glaring.
 When it opened its mouth, no sound came forth, just a soft puff of ash.
 ‚ÄúA soul seeking release,‚Äù Qurrah said.

What took me by surprise was the betrayal I felt.
 All the years I‚Äôd lived in the village, I‚Äôd never counted on anyone the way I had done with this group, Chevelle especially.
 The feeling in my chest was so thick and heavy it burned.
 Struggling with my reactions kept me distracted from the ride.
 It was steep now, rocky, a haze hanging in the few spiky trees.
 When we stopped for the evening, the men quietly set up a perimeter.
 Except for Chevelle.
 He was watching me as I glared back at him.
 Why had I expected more from him?
 He was my watcher.

I closed my eyes tight in an attempt to stop it.
 ‚ÄúGet her a drink,‚Äù someone commanded.
 I felt the hand in mine then, as it was pulled away, replaced with a glass.
 I grimaced; I doubted I could hold a glass up, let alone myself.
 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs only water,‚Äù someone reassured me.
 At the word, I realized I was parched, bone dry.
 I forced myself up, keeping my eyes tight as I concentrated on getting the glass to my lips.
 They were rough, cracked; I could feel them against the rim of the glass.
 I wondered if it was dried blood or if I had been down so long they‚Äôd simply split.
 I drank the full glass and felt it exchanged for another.

"Rachel doesn't have anyone either, but she's still suffering from a deeper hurt.
 She's with my mother."
 My confusion must have been more than usually self-evident as I sat up.
 "No, Mother isn't going through a good episode.
 She's asleep.
 Rachel crept into her room and crawled into bed with her.
 It's a poor substitute for what she aches for, but it's all Mother can offer right now."
 "Alec, there must be something we can do."

He could see a man cloaked in black standing upon a hill.
 Red eyes burned through the blackness within his hood.
 The feeling of absolute power then was greater than Qurrah had ever felt, greater than even the master of his youth._
 Why should I follow?
 _Qurrah heard himself ask.
 Hands stretched to the heavens, the cloaked man laughed.
 His power surged with the laughter, obliterating Qurrah‚Äôs ability to stand._
 Because I am eternal, _said the figure._ I sire war.
 I sow bloodshed.
 I create my dead, and the dead follow.

Is ‚ÄúLike a Rolling Stone‚Äù better than ‚ÄúGreat Balls of Fire?‚Äù  Is ‚ÄúWorking Class Hero?‚Äù  If so, why?
 The lyrics.
 That‚Äôs what you really have to talk about, the lyrics.
 I don‚Äôt think anyone would claim any rock song is today‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Second Coming,‚Äù ‚Äìexcept, maybe some critics who want to call Dylan our Dante.
 But, the words are what‚Äôs become important.
 I mean, the beat, the beat gets the thing listened to, and the words keep it being sung.
 In a sense it‚Äôs a con game‚Äîsuck them in with the beat and make them listen.
 Right?
 What was I saying?

You especially do not trust people who try to kill you while you sleep.
 And as long as people thought he might be Ravenhurr, maybe a little crazy from a spell gone wrong or something, the less likely the Guild of the Celestial Path would send the Immortal Guards against him.
 So Rodregas said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say I am trying to figure out who I am.
 You can call me‚Ä¶,‚Äù he thought for a minute, making it obvious he was making up a fake name.
 He did not want to use his real name.
 He thought to himself, ‚ÄúWho do I want to be?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm going to try to fight against the Immortalists, then some sort of name fit for a Celestial Paladin, or maybe one fit for an Infernal adversary was needed,‚Äù he thought with a smile.
 The only way he could have survived the ceremony would have been divine intervention, so he said the first thing that came to mind, ‚ÄúYou can call me Sir Paladin, that will work for now,‚Äù he said it with a smile and a slight snicker at his own joke.
 ‚ÄúJust what kind of Paladin would you be?‚Äù Imeralda asked him.
 ‚ÄúWhy, it should be obvious to you more than anyone,‚Äù Rodregas said with a slight bow to the beautiful half AElf.
 ‚ÄúThe kind of heroic Paladin that rescues beautiful maidens in distress and frees‚Äô innocent prisoners from the dungeons of evil sorcerers.‚Äù Rodregas could not help but smile at his own line.

"Clap your hands," Teri told her.
 "What?"
 "Clap your hands."
 Marie did so, and music played as water began to make the water wheel turn.
 "Oh!
 It's a fountain!
 How does it work?"
 "It runs on battery, and it's sound-activated."
 When the music and water stopped, Marie clapped her hands again.
 "How clever!"

These resources can never be exhausted because the more they are drawn upon, the more they grow.
 The real challenge of development is developing people ‚Äì not only in the external sense of providing them with food, clothing, good health and fresh water, but also in the inner sense of developing their awareness, attitudes, skills and values to make them more enlightened, productive and contented human beings.
 What we need today is fresh leadership in thought by our leaders to educate themselves and then the world about the opportunities of the third millennium, and then to take the actions to convert these possibilities into actualities.
 Developing our human resourcefulness is the single greatest need and opportunity of our time.
 Tapping Unutilized Resources
 Economic and social development strategies emphasize the strengthening of social capacity by building up physical infrastructure, production facilities and commercial organizations, and by creating a conducive environment for increasing economic activity through appropriate laws, fiscal, monetary and trade policies.
 Human development strategies focus on improving the welfare and capacities of the individual through better health, education, political choice and economic opportunity.
 Together they encompass the two basic components of all development personal and institutional, individual and collective.
 The challenge is to develop simultaneously both individual and social capacities and utilize their potentials in a complementary manner.
 For the individual, development involves acquisition of greater know ledge, more progressive attitudes, improved skills and higher values.

The prisoners were too dangerous to release, after Ravenhurr had so pissed them off by their imprisonment.
 But people did not question the order of the sorcerer and master of Raven Keep, so it should work.
 He dared not stay longer than he had to; Rodregas did not believe that he could fool Ravenhurr‚Äôs guards and servants for long.
 Ravenhurr was a powerful sorcerer who used magic quite casually; it would become quite obvious that Rodregas did not know how to use magic anywhere near Ravenhurr‚Äôs level.
 As soon as the keep emptied out for the birthday celebration he would make his escape.
 If he missed this opportunity he was not sure when he could try again.
 It was very rare for an Immortalist to leave his tower, and if he were behaving oddly, the guild would send someone to check on him soon.
 They were careful in their control of the kingdom.
 For a while Rodregas just leaned against the cold stone wall.
 Not thinking of anything, there was too much to think about to even start.

"Come on--let's go see what else we can find."
 He took her to a drugstore, handing her a 20-dollar bill and wandering off when he realized that there were some toiletries she needed but was too embarrassed to pick up while he was watching.
 When she was done, he took her to a jewelry store, thinking she might like that, but there was jewelry in 1927.
 She was much more interested in the electronic gadgets next door, and she spent ten minutes exclaiming over the effects of a blacklight.
 When he bought her one, her face came alive with delight.
 "It'll make your rug glow!"
 "Just what I always wanted: fluorescent purple carpet."
 But he grinned as he took the bag from the cashier.
 "Thank you so much, Rick," she said, beaming up at him.
 "I think you're more excited about the blacklight than the clothes."

Prom was my arch-nemesis.
 There were really only two times a year that the universe managed to penetrate my historical indifference to the opposite sex.
 Prom, and Valentine's Day.
 Of the two, Prom was the more deadly.
 Valentine's Day was usually filled with enough examples of guys screwing up to make me feel okay.
 They were always picking the wrong present, forgetting to buy one, or otherwise making the day less than perfect.
 That in turn helped me remember that most relationships seemed to be more fuss and mess than they were worth.
 Why get something built up so much in your mind that you can't possibly ever realize it?
 All of the little things about Valentine's Day that grounded me in reality were overcome by the mystique of Prom.
 Instead of people fighting, there were dozens, sometimes even hundreds, of couples who all seemed to be very much in love.

He was on his knees, his silk outfit stained by grass and dirt.
 Blood ran from where Harruq had broken his nose.
 ‚ÄúName a price, name it, anything, just name it!‚Äù
 Harruq glanced at Qurrah, who only chuckled louder.
 ‚ÄúWe have little need for riches, noble.
 All we want is you.‚Äù
 The man paled.
 ‚ÄúMe?
 What do you want me for?
 The elves‚Ä¶‚Äåthey sent you to attack me, didn‚Äôt they?

The guard fell at his feet, bleeding from a severed arm and a gutted belly.
 Soaked in blood, Harruq turned to the remaining guards and bellowed like the mad beast he was.
 The remaining two facing him were trained well.
 They held firm when Harruq charged, and stayed close together.
 Because of this, they managed to survive the initial onslaught.

 ‚ÄúDo not come closer,‚Äù Qurrah said, cracking his whip across the grass.
 Fire spread before his feet, which were black with smoke.
 The two guards ignored his threats, knowing the difficulty of using a whip in melee combat.

Harruq shrugged in response.
 ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs never here.
 She always shows up after I do.‚Äù
 The smaller half-orc scanned the area, seeing no sign of the elf.
 ‚ÄúPerhaps she is not coming,‚Äù Qurrah offered.
 ‚ÄúYou are late, after all.
 On the other hand, perhaps I scared her off.
 I do have a creepy aura about me, wouldn‚Äôt you agree?‚Äù

It should have bothered me, but I just shrugged it off and went to the far stall.
 A split second after I'd closed the door I heard the heavy wooden outer door open.
 Normally that wouldn't have caused me to even pause in my normal routine, but it suddenly felt as if the stall was too small.
 "I told you to stay away from him, you stupid whore."
 I didn't recognize the voice for all that I felt like I should.
 It was a snarling alto that even distorted by anger had traces of smooth velvet, the kind of voice guys occasionally fantasized about, when they weren't thinking about other, less subtle, feminine features.
 Something hit the stall next to me, hard enough to leave dents.
 I was scared, I should have been terrified, but I was too busy trying to breathe.
 It was like the air had become thick, and although the fine strands of hair on the back of my neck hadn't moved, it felt like they should be standing on end.
 I heard indistinct sobbing, and then the voice returned and made me shiver.

India alone would have needed at least 50 million hectares of additional land to produce the wheat and rice it now produces, if average yields had remained at pre-Green Revolution levels.
 It is, therefore, important that the concept of higher productivity per unit of land, water, time, energy, labour and capital be extended to all farming systems and all regions.
 Most developing countries will have no option but to produce more food and agricultural commodities from less land and water in the twenty-first century.
 The challenge lies in accomplishing this in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner.
 The FAO should launch a co ordinated international effort to extend the principles and strategies of the Green Revolution to eradicate global food shortages within a decade.
 The Green Revolution was originally applied to improving productivity of wheat and rice in high potential areas.
 After the first rounds of phenomenal success, the effort to extend it to other agricultural regions and other crops lost momentum, because the urgent necessity had been eliminated.
 Recognizing the importance of agricultural surplus to rural employment, industrialization and exports, renewed efforts are called for to apply the comprehensive, integrated approach of the Green Revolution to high potential commercial crops and to all regions.
 With the knowledge gained over the past 30 years, greater emphasis can be placed on ensuring that the productivity improvements are not only economically viable but also ecologically sustainable.
 Region-specific strategies should be adopted for mountain areas, high rainfall tropics, uplands and irrigated plains.

My surprise must have bled through to my face.
 Alec's smile had a tinge of sadness to it as he led me away.
 "There's still a lot you don't know about all of the others.
 There's much I could tell you about Jasmin, but it isn't my story to share.
 Suffice it to say only Dominic has a greater capacity for empathy."
 I wanted to ask what Alec meant, but it was more and more obvious he wasn't going to answer anything he didn't want to.
 We walked in comfortable silence for several minutes before turning off into what I could only assume was the Lilac Room.
 Donovan looked up as we entered the suite.
 "I trust your mother was well, sir?"
 Alec nodded, a short choppy motion that eloquently conveyed his desire not to discuss the matter.

 I was wrestling with these things, absurd things, but I couldn‚Äôt see clearly.
 All I saw was blackness, the blackness of dried blood.
 I don‚Äôt know what Crafty and Skippy thought‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt even leave them a note.
 I feel bad about it now‚Äîand this, finally, I think, was what pissed Crafty off and led him to hire a lawyer for himself, to try and, you know, basically, steal my material.
 It was like, if you‚Äôre not gonna represent yourself well, we‚Äôre gonna take away your soul, all your work, all your history.
 Shit.
 That shark he hired---what a bastard.
 But, I was oblivious at the time.
 God bless Pete.

 There he bought a sturdy horse and began his long ride south to the Quellan forest.

 It‚Äôs almost 1:30 in the morning, and I would like to get home before my dad wakes himself up,‚Äù Emily said, and walked towards her house.
 I waved quickly and followed.
 The rest of the night was quiet and didn‚Äôt include singing dwarfs.
 Before we went to bed though there was a lot of furious writing as Emily tried to write everything down.

And then Ruby was beside us from out of nowhere, her words startling me back to the cold, dull room.
 ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre coming in.‚Äù Chevelle leaned back, his fingers brushing my collarbone when he pulled away.
 I bit my lip at the tingle that ran through me, and the corner of his mouth turned up into a different kind of smile.
 He stood to walk from the room and I stared at the stone entry, struggling to keep my thoughts from spinning out of control.
 Too much had happened.
 Too much was wrong.
 My life had flipped, twisted into some strange reflection of itself, and I couldn‚Äôt reconcile the fragments.
 It caused me physical pain to think about Chevelle‚Äôs touch, about council, about what was happening, and I knew it was the bonds.
 When Grey walked out, my trance broke and I noticed Ruby by the front window, wearing an odd smile.
 I flushed and turned from her, rolling into a ball on my blankets, remembering no more than the feel of his skin on my neck, the quirk of his lips.

She was betrothed to Davis.
 When she was dressed, she put her betrothal ring back on.
 She shouldn't have left it off last night.
 And she should have asked Rick to set an alarm for her so that she could have walked in the garden this morning.
 She shouldn't skip any mornings; she never knew which day might be the one when she'd find herself back in 1927.
 When she went downstairs, Rick was watching television.
 "Want to watch `Bonanza'?"
 he asked.
 "OK." He glanced at her, bemused, when she sat down on the far end of the sofa.
 "You can come closer.

In a command economy, a few people at the top receive most of the information and take most of the decisions, while the rest of the population carries them out.
 In contrast, the market is based on millions of decisions taken every day by millions of individuals in fields, factories and retail stores around the country.
 All these decision makers require timely access to re liable sources of information.
 Information is needed to make sound business decisions, such as the production of or demand for different commodities or variations in price by region or over time.
 Easy access, maximum dissemination, full disclosure, precise accuracy and credibility are imperative.
 Creating these conditions will require the establishment of new institutions and substantial investment in infra structure.
 In many of these countries, the press has freed itself from being solely an instrument of government, but television is still largely under state control.
 In the entire former USSR today there is no adequate agricultural extension service to transmit research findings from the laboratory to the field, especially to small private farmers.
 Poor communications systems are incapable of handling the large volume of telephone, fax, telex and computerized messages needed for commercial linkages with other countries.
 10.Catalytic initiatives can release social dynamism: Social change is facilitated and accelerated by initiatives to introduce or demonstrate new patterns of activity and behaviour appropriate to the goals of the transition.

 Dieredon fought, but it felt as if a thousand hands pulled him back.
 Pain spiked within his chest, and a sick sound filled his head as two of his ribs broke.
 A harrowing gasp escaped his lips.
 He dropped to his knees as the pressure finally ended.
 Dieredon lifted the bow and reached to his quiver.
 The blades retracted, and in the heartbeat it took him to draw two arrows, a thin string materialized in the air, ready to be drawn.
 The elf fired the arrows.
 Velixar laughed as they pierced into his stomach and chest.
 No blood ran from them.

Or his property.
 ‚ÄúFrey,‚Äù Chevelle said, ‚Äúthis is Anvil.‚Äù He nodded toward a giant of a man who bowed his head respectfully.
 ‚ÄúAnd Grey.‚Äù The wiry man bent and straightened, his movements too quick.
 I drew in a startled breath as two more figures came into view.
 A pair of slender elves stepped in sync as they stopped just outside the group.
 They were tall and lean, dressed in robes the color of ash that only accentuated their shocking silver hair.
 I was convinced the moonlight must have been exaggerating it.
 And then I jumped again as, on either side of them, two beasts walked forward to stand just in front of the twinned elves.
 Steed brushed an arm against mine, mumbling under his breath, ‚ÄúYeah, they‚Äôre not from around here.‚Äù I felt myself leaning on Chevelle for support.
 ‚ÄúRhys and Rider Strong,‚Äù he said from behind me.

 She looked up to see if she was close to Rick's house.
 It wasn't the house just ahead to the right, or the one beyond that.
 Had she come over that hill?
 Surely she couldn't have come very far.
 Panicking, she began to run.
 A woman was coming out of one house, wearing very short blue trousers, and Marie ran in the other direction.

With Isaac's reassuring presence at my side in History, I weathered the renewed gossip, apparently occasioned by the entire pack's absence during lunch for the second day in a row, and soon found myself reunited with Alec in Physics.
 As luck would have it, Mrs. Alexander was gone again, and the substitute was typically clueless about what we were supposed to be doing.
 Alec of course spent the whole class unearthing other little bits of embarrassing information.
 I'd never experienced anything like it, every question I answered spawned two more, and he invariably seemed to figure out the underlying reasons I'd done a given thing, or reacted a certain way.
 I'd just finished describing my failed tryout for the school's production of¬†To Kill a Mockingbird, when he hit me with a completely unexpected question.
 "So tell me about both your best date and your worst date before you came here."
 I felt my skin instantly heat up, and looked down, unable to meet his gaze.
 He let me sit there for a couple of seconds, and then reached out and used one gentle finger to nudge my chin up.
 "What's the matter, afraid I'll be jealous?"
 I shook my head, fighting the urge to look back down.

I don't think I can ever be happy again.
 When I go back, I'll be miserably lonely for you.
 But if I were to stay here, I'd miss my family, my home, my roots.
 I'd feel misplaced.
 I'd worry about my family and how upset they are and how they'd always wonder what had happened to me."
 She took her toothbrush and put toothpaste on it.
 "I understand.
 But that doesn't make it any easier."
 Tossing his washcloth into the clothes basket, he picked up a brush, and when she straightened after having brushed her teeth, he began smoothing her hair with long, slow strokes.
 Marie closed her eyes, tears seeping from them.

"The marriage was apparently an unhappy one.
 Marie, who had, in her youth, had a reputation as a vibrant, fun-loving, somewhat mischievous girl, was rarely seen in public after her marriage.
 Reports suggest that she was a victim of spousal abuse.
 The official cause of her death in 1941 was an infection contracted during the birth of her youngest child.
 However, that child was born in 1936, so it is highly unlikely that she had a terminal infection for five years.
 Rumors at the time suggested that her husband had transmitted a venereal disease to her."
 Rick was shocked.
 He had a hard time picturing the young woman in the picture as a victim.
 Of course, even today women stayed with men who abused them, and it would have been much harder for a woman in the 1920s to escape.
 But why had she married him?

If it was, Dominic's fluid, expressive face pulled it off.
 "Nonsense.
 Once we undo all of the damage from her teaching you, you'll do so well even she won't flunk you."
 It went against everything past experience with Mrs. Tiggs had taught me, but I almost believed her.
 Chapter 26 It was amazing how quickly my classes flew by when I had a friend, or at least a protector, with me at all times.
 Then again all of Monday had flown by, not just the school portion of the day, so it really shouldn't have been a surprise today was doing likewise.
 After Spanish, Jasmin had escorted me to Mrs. Campbell's class.
 Telling her I wasn't going to be able to help out at the lab anymore had been one of the harder things I'd ever done, but she'd been surprisingly understanding.
 We'd scheduled my makeup test for the next day and I'd left with the sneaking suspicion she'd guessed more about what was really going on in Sanctuary than either pack would've liked.
 I'd been busy contemplating what Mrs. Campbell might have really figured out as we left the building, only to have Jasmin interrupt my musings with an apology of all things.

 Then, softer, ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt even tell Junnie.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt understand.
 The cold, wet ground seeped through the material covering my legs, and I shifted, fidgeting as I looked up at him.
 ‚ÄúI mean I can‚Äôt do magic, just useless stuff‚Ä¶ lighting candles‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThen we start with fire,‚Äù he said.
 Chevelle lowered his hand to mine and stood, pulling me up and toward the center of the clearing.
 When we‚Äôd distanced ourselves from the tree line, he stopped and turned back to me, still holding my right hand.
 My eyes followed his as he looked down at our clasped hands and a cool blue flame lit on my right sleeve.
 Immediately, my free hand jerked up to extinguish it.

The two grew quiet, and they stared at the fire as the time passed.
 At last, when Harruq was sure Qurrah would not bring up the subject, he spoke.
 ‚ÄúAbout the guards,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúYou think they‚Äôre telling the truth?‚Äù
 Qurrah glanced up.
 ‚ÄúAbout the elven blood in us?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù
 Qurrah chuckled, but it was mirthless.
 ‚ÄúI do, and it does not surprise me as much as it should.
 I‚Äôm not sure who would mate with our mother, but some elf man did.

I was just over-reacting.
 It'll turn out to be nothing."
 It was just like Mom to misplace something important like that.
 I opened my mouth to agree with her, but stopped before the words could fully form.
 I didn't know much, but fraud wasn't the kind of thing you associated with a slap on the wrist.
 If the worst happened and Mom was going to serve jail time then we had bigger problems than even what she was admitting to.
 ** It looked like the sun must have set hours ago, but it wasn't really dark.
 The full moon seemed oddly brighter than normal, edging the landscape with a silvery tracing.
 The cool illumination was strangely complemented by the warm tendrils of light trying to escape from the greenery surrounding the area.
 I let my gaze drop, and found an unearthly pool of liquid light at my feet.

Proof they would be attacked and killed, proof they must fight the elves.
 It was not hard to incite a riot.
 They were fearful creatures.
 I convinced them to raid the castle, gave them direction.
 And then I returned.
 I knew I would have time to prepare.
 They would be slow to gather and make the journey.
 I was thinking of Noble as I resolved to wear the dress meant for our wedding, with its dramatic shape and deep meaning.
 I remembered when he‚Äôd given it to me, explaining the white stood for innocence.
 I had stifled a giggle then.

‚ÄúOver the centuries, I have gathered many items to aid those who would swear their lives to me,‚Äù Velixar said.
 The locks clicked open, the lid raised, and then he reached inside and pulled out two swords sheathed in gleaming obsidian.
 ‚ÄúThese swords were once wielded by Aerland Shen.
 He led the elves that aided Karak in the great war against Ashhur.
 When Celestia cursed his kind, they shared his curse.‚Äù Velixar smiled at Harruq, his eyes gleaming.
 ‚ÄúLong have I waited for someone to wield these blades.
 An elf crafted and used them in battle, an elf cursed into an orc.
 These swords can only be held by one who has the blood of both inside him.‚Äù Velixar held the hilts out to Harruq, who drew one from its sheath.
 The sword‚Äôs blade was deep black and wreathed in a soft red glow.
 He weaved it through the air, his mouth agape at the ease in which it glided.

I returned his smile and tried not to focus on questions of just how much of the fluttering in my stomach was due to natural attraction for him, and how much was due to mystical heebie-jeebies.
 "For my part, I'm just glad you're telling me something for once instead of continuing to keep me in the dark."
 He released my chin and ran a finger down the side of my face.
 "Well, then I'm afraid I'll have to trade upon your current satisfaction to beg your leave.
 As much as I'd rather stay here and bask in your beauty, it's time for more training."
 I tried to keep the disappointment from my face, but his expression fell a little despite my best efforts.
 "You're unhappy with me?"
 "No.
 I mean not really unhappy, at least not with you.
 Maybe with the situation.

Then Ravenhurr yelled out, ‚ÄúSpirea faira podia turiana,‚Äù and the circle holding the Celestial Lion started to burn in the same blue flames, the blue flames that make up the creation forces of life that can only be called up when the Celestial Realm was close.
 Suddenly the sleeping lion looked up in surprise and started to growl and then he started to burn.
 Rodregas had seen enough of lesser versions of the ritual to expect it, but to watch it was amazing.
 The circle blazed with an intense heat that blasted his face and the magnificent creature inside blazed with blue creation fire.
 It was a sudden and violent and primal process.
 The lion started to stand up and then simply fell apart into blazing blue energy.
 That energy surged out of the circle and swirled around inside the larger outer circle.
 Every hair on Rodregas‚Äô body stood at attention.
 Then the blue flaming energy was sucked into the pale green circle.
 There the prisoner, now empty of his own essence, stood still.

I know it's kind of anachronistic, but I take those kinds of promises seriously.
 Most of us here in Sanctuary do.
 I need to know what you saw and heard while you were in the bathroom with Lucy and Jasmin, before Cassie arrived."
 "You're going to protect me from Cassie¬†and¬†Jasmin?"
 His face was completely serious as he nodded.
 "If necessary, but I need to know what else was said so I know how serious things are.
 Jasmin had a really tough childhood.
 Her mom was killed while she was really young, and her father was pretty abusive.
 Alec's mother did a good thing by bringing her into their home and trying to give her a decent life, but she's not completely stable."
 My laugh had a touch more hysteria in it than I'd meant to let slip through.

Maybe I'd still have apologized to him if he'd been in school on Monday.
 Instead, he'd skipped the entire first half of the week, and by the time I did finally see him, I'd backed myself so far into a corner, I couldn't even meet his eyes during class.
 Somehow I'd managed to make it through day after day of isolation.
 Brandon's friends continued to more or less ignore me, the boys without the trace of spite that I picked up from most of the girls.
 Britney started another rumor sometime about the middle of the week.
 Apparently I was now some kind of closet drug addict who was hoping to get Brandon to fund my habit.
 Rachel hadn't been back to tutoring since we'd argued, and I was picking up an increasing number of hostile looks from people I didn't even know.
 Some of them were recognizable as Alec's friends, but most of them were just nameless nerds who apparently had a soft spot for Rachel, or a towering hatred for Brandon's friends.

The magic energy throbbed and Rodregas could feel the ritual screaming for the final release of the magic; there was no way to save anyone else.
 Rodregas would probably die in the next few seconds in the magical backlash of the failed spell, but he thought that he had understood the meaning of the final trigger words used in the rehearsal.
 Rodregas‚Äô years of rejecting his early upbringing made him embarrassed to say the words, but he reached down into that deep, nearly empty place where his little bit of power still sparked.
 Rodregas reached deep inside and pulled that spark of power up until he felt the tingle and inner sensation that he always inelegantly called ‚Äòmy itch.‚Äô Rodregas filled his words with the power and the intent behind them.
 ‚ÄúMy mind,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúMy soul to be made one through the flame,‚Äù he whispered, and then the circle of blood and living organs started to burn and he burned.
 He burned so deeply that no scream crossed his lips.
 He felt every fiber of his being simply burn.
 Rodregas tried to scream, but no sound could pass his lips.

I was to get her to use the word ‚ÄúOxy‚Äù and discuss the price and the quantity and to get Ashley to acknowledge that the price was ‚Äú$2500 cash for the one hundred Oxys.‚Äù I placed the call, nervous and anxious to be sure to get what the police wanted.
 To my shock, the recording on Ashley‚Äôs phone stated it was no longer in service.
 The officer was obviously disappointed and suggested that perhaps they caught on to the scheme, as they were very savvy.
 Just as he was rambling on how difficult it was to get someone to deal with you.

Emily‚Äôs mom was short, small and bony.
 Her light brown hair was almost blonde without any gray in it.
 The woman definitely did not look her age at all, and she was still as beautiful as I imagined she was in her youth.
 She smiled warmly at us, her smile a reflection of Emily‚Äôs.
 ‚ÄúHello girls, come in.
 Emily, dear, can you put your laundry away?
 After you do that, you can hang out in your room.‚Äù Emily nodded and disappeared inside.
 Her mom moved aside so I could walk in.
 I unlaced my sneakers and walked up the stairs, looking at the flower paintings hung along the wall that her mom had painted in her spare time.
 I pushed open Emily‚Äôs bedroom door to see her stuffing her clothes in the drawer and flopping onto the bed.

I skidded to a halt and scanned the trees.
 I didn‚Äôt see any trace of where Seth could have ran.
 That shows how much I know about asking questions.
 I don‚Äôt get the answers and boom; I lose it and become a demanding person.
 I walked more slowly, watching the trees.
 I sent a silent prayer that Seth hadn‚Äôt entered Igneeria, because then I would never find him.
 What bugged me the most was that Seth didn‚Äôt fight me when I pushed him down.
 He just sat on the ground not saying anything at all in his own defense.
 Now, I couldn‚Äôt find him anywhere and I would never get my answer.
 I heard a large snap to my right and I whirled around.

 I only wanted to be proficient with my staff, not a master.‚Äù
 A tiny bit of panic crept into Harruq‚Äôs voice.
 ‚ÄúYeah, but, but, it‚Äôs only an hour or two, and who said you were proficient anyway?
 I could beat you without trying, and so could anyone better than me.

You appeared to be an Immortalist Sorcerer and I have grown to hate the Immortalists.
 When it became clear that you were not, I stopped trying to kill you.‚Äù He paused at this, and then Rodregas could tell he made a decision.
 ‚ÄúYou have given me a sword, if a small one, and among my people that is a powerful gesture.
 I will not lie to you, I have left my old life behind and the last few years I have learned to truly hate the Immortalists.
 I travel with you only because the others were going to go back to their homes, and I have no home to go back to,‚Äù he seemed to finish, but then added, ‚ÄúLast night you pointed out that the forces of the Immortalists would be after you and you would fight them.
 And you also proved that you can fight.‚Äù Once again he paused.
 He was clearly a man that liked to think before he spoke.
 ‚ÄúI am simply using you as bait.
 When they come for you, I will kill them.
 Fighting together we will kill some of their vaulted Immortal Guards.‚Äù As Doi‚Äôvan finished he gave a low growl and shook his horned head, his thick mane of wild jet black hair was almost as distinctive as Imeralda‚Äôs own auburn flowing locks.

‚ÄúA town called Woodhaven.
 Well, two towns really, Celed and Singhelm.
 They have since grown together and merged.
 It is an interesting place, Harruq, where elves and men live together, each in their respective parts of the city.
 Their tolerance of other races is, obviously, a necessity.
 I have thought to take us there.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWhy do we need to leave?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYour work is almost done,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúThe walls are repaired, and half the men who worked with you have already been cut loose.
 I, however, have much to learn but cannot do so here because of prying eyes and attentive ears.

My guitar does a lot of talking.
 Like Zappa‚Äôs ‚ÄúMy Guitar Wants to Kill Your Mama.‚Äù  (laughs)  But, sure, I‚Äôve made it talk, talk for me, if you want that spin on it.

He was underground, in a cave.
 He groaned and sat up, his back throbbing.
 His head was pounding so hard he had to close his eyes to keep from passing out.
 He felt worse than he did when the stupid faery smashed his sword into his head.
 He looked around the dimly lit cavern and spotted Jazell, sprawled out on the floor.
 He crawled over to her.
 *** I couched and gagged, turning over.
 Dirt fell to the ground from my dry mouth.
 I looked over to see Seth fall back on the ground, breathing heavily.
 I looked around the room and up at the sky, but I couldn't really see it.

‚ÄúSure, gradually.
 And then, another time, when I decided to actually find a church I would go to more than once or twice, was on account of feeling quite blessed and knowing I ought to be spending more time thanking God than I ever would on my own.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow did you know which church to pick?‚Äù Such a question calls for more coffee.
 I pour a cup and say, ‚ÄúWell, the evangelical ones were where I found more people who actually tried to get closer to God.
 You know, to better understand God through all kinds of means.
 Intellect and others.
 I mean, I‚Äôm all for preachers showing how Biblical advise can help us be nicer, more prosperous, more benevolent, more likely to work toward human rights and all.
 But without the honest search for connection with the Holy Spirit, none of that good advice carries much weight.‚Äù
 Eric vs. Max Von Sydow
 Back on the road my thoughts pick up where they left off in San Luis Obispo, and I wonder if Brother Lawrence perceived his constant companion as the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit.
 Maybe my problem with adoring God is my habit of looking at, or for, God the Father, who in my vocabulary is easy to respect, admire, stand in awe of, or even worship, but is hard for me to adore.

Rachel at least didn't seem to notice.
 Somehow I'd lost track of the fact that it was a Wednesday, and Brandon therefore wouldn't be taking me home.
 "Great.
 Britney's been avoiding me like the plague.
 I didn't even see her leave today."
 I'd never noticed that Rachel's laugh was possibly the prettiest I'd ever heard.
 Tinkling bells and all that aside, it really did sound like the kind of laugh you'd hear described for the princess of a fairy tale.
 Had I really never heard her laugh before, or was it just that she hadn't ever meant it before?
 "She left about five minutes before James did."
 "Still chatting up her prime candidate for the big dance?"

One of them.
 (laughs)  One of them.
 Sorry, baby.
 Carol Warner, I met at a school dance, where Black Lung played.
 It was in the school cafeteria‚ÄîJesus, those gigs, you gotta love ‚Äòem, right?
 I mean, looking back, you gotta love that shit.
 Girls and boys rubbing against each other, hormones exploding all over the room, while we grind away at some awful cover song like ‚ÄúOne is the Loneliest Number.‚Äù  Occasionally slipping in one of our originals which is met with a silence like we farted in church.
 (laughs)  It was a kick.
 I mean, these couples using the opportunity to practically hump on the dance floor, hands all over asses, the chaperons looking bored over in the corner, old Ricky Glass, the mechanical drawing teacher, toking up.
 What a time that was.

While the gains have been significant, all of us will acknowledge that we have not taken full advantage of this opportunity to build a better world.
 Though great dangers have receded, old and new threats still loom large, demanding courageous action.
 The door remains ajar.
 The hour is still in progress.
 There is still time and that time is now.
 The world today has far greater opportunities that ever before, far greater degrees of freedom within which to act to accelerate progress and eradicate suffering.
 The Millennium Development Goals adopted at the UN Millennium Summit in 2000 represent the essential minimum needs for building a stable, secure, free and prosperous global community.
 We confront once again an unprecedented opportunity and an unfinished agenda.
 Disappointed by our failure to achieve all that seemed possible or disillusioned by the emergence of new, more dreadful challenges, some may feel prompted to curb mind‚Äôs contemplation of the greater potentials, dispense with lofty plans and resign themselves to the slower, circuitous pace of progress that characterized earlier periods.
 That choice would be unfortunate.

Where are you?‚Äù
 Then he heard talking and shut his mouth.
 ‚ÄúAre you alright, Dieredon?‚Äù an elf asked.
 The scoutmaster nodded, leaning heavily on his bow.
 ‚ÄúI will be fine.
 His magic left my body upon his death.‚Äù
 A neigh brought his attention upward.
 Sonowin landed next to him, her white hair stained red in places.
 She nuzzled the elf and snorted something.
 ‚ÄúYou worry too much, old girl,‚Äù Dieredon said, his voice cracking several times.

Standing before him was Dieredon, his bow held in both hands like a staff.
 Long blades stretched out from either end, tiny razor teeth lining the front.
 The elf twirled the bow in his hands and then charged.
 Two quick hits batted one of Harruq‚Äôs swords out and away.
 A feint, so quick Harruq blocked on instinct, took care of the other.
 His weapons gone, the half-orc was exposed.
 Dieredon wasted no time smashing the half-orc‚Äôs groin.
 As he doubled over in pain, a snap kick smacked his chin, splattering blood and forcing him to drop.
 The sharp tip of a blade pressed against Harruq‚Äôs throat before he knew what was happening.
 ‚ÄúMove,‚Äù Dieredon said.

I was being ridiculous.
 At this rate, I‚Äôd be fawning and flipping my hair like Evelyn by sundown.
 When I finally walked into the library, I remembered why I didn‚Äôt go there to study lineages.
 There must have been a thousand volumes and tenfold more scrolls in the main level alone.
 And I had no magic to lead me in the right direction.
 I went to the section which would most likely house the desired information, and then closed my eyes and concentrated.
 Maybe it wouldn‚Äôt work, but I could try.
 I wasn‚Äôt sure I felt anything, but after a few minutes I imagined my right hand might have tingled a little.
 I grabbed a close volume and leafed through it.
 It was a legacy of the Viridian Forest clan.

One problem I point out is that the drugstore will be closed in a few minutes but they send the crew that direction for feedback on the location.
 The call comes back and the parking lot is virtually empty of cars leaving no cover for the officers to hide.
 I am starting to feel like I know more about this drug busting business than the cops.
 After a change of venue to a nearby grocery store down the street and several miles within the county line, it is nearly 9 pm and I have been unable to call my wife for over three hours.
 The officers move into place for the bust.
 Several marked police cars hide in an adjacent apartment complex that has a driveway into the grocery store parking lot at the opposite end of the shopping center.
 I am instructed to park my truck‚Äôs front end against a fence that borders the parking lot facing the greenbelt.
 I am shown new surveillance photos of the two suspects and their vehicle: a red Dodge Charger with tinted windows.
 The code word which I am to use in a sentence to confirm the exchange of money for drugs has been changed to ‚ÄúReno‚Äù and I see a pattern so I assume that if the deal does not go down this time, my next code word may be ‚ÄúVegas.‚Äù I pray there isn‚Äôt a next time.

It was an odd sight for me as I watched these officers chow down their burgers and sip on their drinks reminiscing about the drug deal they just finished.
 Just another day at the office, I guess.
 In a moment, my crack-berry starts to blow up with one call after the next from Ashley, wanting to know when we are doing this deal.
 I must keep buying time with excuses, now nearing a two-hour delay waiting for the cops to come from the other bust.
 It is looking like this deal is not going to happen either.
 I answer some of the calls and ignore others as I am instructed to do by Officer White.
 I whisper in one call as if I can‚Äôt talk because I am still stuck at home with my wife and cannot talk freely.
 I reassure Ashley that I will meet her as soon as I can get out.
 I think of my wife and son at home wondering why I haven‚Äôt called; is it over?
 Am I dead?

She tried to break away from him because he was kissing her so hard that her teeth were cutting into her lips; she could taste the blood.
 But he wouldn't let her go.
 And then he pushed his tongue into her mouth, and shock and disgust fused with the pain to give her the strength to shove him away.
 Marie could only stare at him as she raised trembling fingers to her bruised and bleeding lips.
 Davis was breathing hard.
 She didn't take her eyes off him as he stood up.
 "Make sure your mother tells you what your duties are once we're married."
 He strode out of the house, heading for Mae's.
 Marie stared after him.
 She knew about sex.

I don‚Äôt get the answers and boom; I lose it and become a demanding person.
 I walked more slowly, watching the trees.
 I sent a silent prayer that Seth hadn‚Äôt entered Igneeria, because then I would never find him.
 What bugged me the most was that Seth didn‚Äôt fight me when I pushed him down.
 He just sat on the ground not saying anything at all in his own defense.
 Now, I couldn‚Äôt find him anywhere and I would never get my answer.
 I heard a large snap to my right and I whirled around.
 I heard another crack and I slowly crept towards the noise.
 Another snap sounded, louder this time, to my left.
 I changed direction and hid behind a tree.

Though he spoke only to the elders, it set into motion behind us a wave of murmurs that filled the room, reverberating up the high ceiling.
 A council elder silenced the witnesses and then trained on me.
 ‚ÄúWho instructed you in fusion?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt have an answer.
 I‚Äôd never heard of fusion.
 I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do, and I looked toward Chevelle out of desperation.
 He was watching me, surprise clear on his face.
 Whatever I‚Äôd been accused of, he hadn‚Äôt expected it.
 The council elders mistook the exchange as an answer.
 ‚ÄúChevelle Vattier, you have led this fusion?‚Äù His head whipped back toward the council table and he shot out a forceful, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù They focused once more on me.
 ‚ÄúI ask again, Elfreda, who taught you the magic to seal yourself to the crystal?‚Äù I was at a loss.

"Hi, I'm Britney."
 I didn't know what to make of her.
 She looked like the type who was always on the fringe of the popular crowd.
 She was the girl who was the first to follow whatever fad happened to be in, and the first to turn on someone if it would make her just a tad more acceptable to her peers.
 I mumbled a response, something that wasn't rude, but which couldn't be mistaken as pleading for friendship.
 Those kinds of girls loved to laugh at the 'poor, desperate, friendless' types behind our backs.
 "You must be Adri Paige.
 I hope people haven't been too terrible to you."
 "Adriana."
 I spent too much time correcting my mom.

It was like being immersed in everything I'd loved only to have it evaporate when I went to grab my surroundings.
 "Hey, that's really pretty good.

 I nodded, hoping Alec would take the hint implied in my silence.
 I should have known better.
 "What's it called?"
 The name slid out of me almost of its own accord.
 "Monster Lake."
 Every single birthday I could remember had involved some kind of trip out to Monster Lake.
 Picnics had swapped off with treasure hunts and then been replaced by other activities depending on Dad's mood and my age.

However, nearly one-half of the world‚Äôs land surface consists of river basins shared by more than one country and more than 30 nations receive more than one-third of their water from outside their borders.
 Therefore, the danger of confrontation and conflict will escalate unless concerted measures are implemented urgently.
 Water shortages occurring in combination with other sources of tension ‚Äî such as in the Middle East ‚Äî will be particularly worrisome.
 Famine remains a persistent threat precisely because the world no longer feels that threat to be severe.
 India‚Äôs last major famine occurred in Bengal in 1943 during World War II.
 Although the deficit in food production was only marginal that year, three million died for lack of strong administrative intervention to improve distribution.
 A marginal deficit could work havoc in the absence of an efficient and equitable public distribution network.
 While there is no scarcity of food in the world, there is also not a sufficiently organized effort to promote food security, precisely because the sense of urgency is lacking.
 Abundant opportunities exist to eradicate hunger, but in the absence of a catastrophic event, serious effort is lacking.
 Famine attracts media coverage, political and public attention, but chronic hunger does not.

Even without a decision to abandon completely their use under any circumstances, a further drastic reduction to somewhere between 20 and 200 warheads is more than sufficient to meet any security need.
 Immediate steps can, and should, be taken to negotiate reductions to this minimum level.
 The relaxation of tensions has drawn public attention away from this issue and reduced the momentum for progress at the very time when there is the greatest opportunity finally to eliminate this threat completely.
 The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which ensures the military superiority of the nuclear powers over other signatories, is an instance of rule by strength forcibly imposed by the major powers on the rest of the world community in the name of peace.
 It is neither equitable nor justifiable.
 Already, 156 countries have signed the treaty, owing either to coercion or indifference, and the number is expected to increase to 170 out of 179 states by 1995.
 The acceptance of non-proliferation by these countries further delegitimizes the continued possession of nuclear weapons by any country.
 All of the treaty non-signatories can be persuaded to sign in exchange for annihilation of these weapons by those that now possess them.
 Under these circumstances, refusal to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty could be considered sufficient grounds for expulsion from UN membership.
 Without a universal ban, the efforts of the nuclear powers to stop proliferation lack moral authority.

 The idea of living two hundred years was‚Ä¶‚Äåwell, more than he could handle.

Maybe not.
 Anyway, we did this heavy piece as a kind of lark‚ÄîI was pissed, I admit by all the dismissals I was getting in the rock press, all the accusations of sell-out.
 So I did this little 45, this really wild piece of music‚Äîthat‚Äôs a Stratocaster I‚Äôm playing but filtered through this mini-moog that Underwood brought with him.
 And damned if it wasn‚Äôt a hit.
 We didn‚Äôt even have a back for it, you know, a flipside.

 One take.
 Anyway, you heard it here first.

She was still in 2011.
 "Rick!"
 She could hear him hurrying toward her, and she turned to meet him.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, hugging her close.
 Tears rolled down her cheeks, and she choked back a sob.
 She missed her mother.
 She loved television and the microwave and blue jeans, but she wanted to exclaim over them with her mother.
 And she wanted to cuddle up next to Davis as they watched television together.
 Her father would buy them one.
 Well, if there were televisions in 1927, he would.

I forced a measure of gaiety into my voice and smiled up at him.
 "Well, I'm glad things turned out the way they did.
 Otherwise we'd both be dead."
 Alec flinched slightly, and then looked at the grotto.
 "I suppose I'd better clean this up or Donovan is going to be very unhappy with me."
 "Who's Don...." I felt my mouth drop as I finally recognized my surroundings.
 "I've been here before.
 In my dream.
 Then I drew it, which I didn't understand because I only ever draw real places, and this was imaginary.
 Only it wasn't, but there wasn't any way for me to know..." I turned around, expecting to have to field a barrage of questions, but Alec was calmly watching me.

I felt a tingle of power as Mallory reached out and placed her hands on either side of his face.
 The power surged, and Alec's heavy, cool power was joined by something light and laughing.
 Several seconds later, Mallory released Alec with a sigh and fell back in obvious exhaustion.
 Alec watched intently until she shook her head, and then the mask fell for just a second before he locked it back in place, hiding the disappointment that for the slimmest of moments had been plainly written on his expression.
 Mallory reached out, as if to take Alec's hand, but he gently set her hands back on her lap.
 "Nothing's changed.
 We'll just proceed as before.
 Rest now, and should the worst come to pass I'll send Donovan to you."
 A few seconds later Alec and I were outside the cabin, walking back in the direction of the waiting motorcycle.
 I reached out to take his hand, and felt a glimmer of relief when he didn't reject the gesture as he had with Mallory.

 ‚ÄúPlease, brother,‚Äù Qurrah said.

 Harruq stared at the dirt, each breath making his shoulders heave.
 His mind reeled, and for reasons he did not understand, he opened his mouth and said, ‚ÄúThat which I fear and desire.
 I have had no questions answered, but I do know this: the time for questions has long ended.‚Äù

The exterior of the building had been impressive, complete with statues and sculptures reminiscent of an eighteenth-century opera house, but I hadn't expected the illusion to hold once I passed through the enormous, gilded doors.
 I'd been wrong.
 The floors were a gorgeous marble which drew the eyes to the nearest golden-white wall, and up the elaborate gilded trim towards vaulted ceilings.
 It was like walking into a palace, complete with painted, spun-sugar clouds, and burgundy drapes made out of rich velvet.
 If it wasn't for the press of people pushing me from behind, I probably would've stayed in the front entryway right up until the sound of the orchestra filtered down to me.
 As it was, I only got a few hurried looks before being rushed along with the rest of the students.
 Seeing all of my classmates looking utterly bored as they allowed themselves to be herded through the most amazing building I'd ever seen brought me back to my original train of thought.
 I hadn't actually spent every waking moment thinking about Les Mis√©rables.
 A fair number of those seconds had been spent with Brandon.
 He'd already been picking me up from school every morning and dropping me off most days.

By 2010, food grain production is expected to reach four times the level in 1960.
 Increased production of other food crops is expected to raise per capita availability in the developing world to 2700 calories per day.
 Per capita meat production is expected to grow by 60 per cent and milk production by 20 per cent.
 During the same period, malnutrition is projected to decline to 640 million persons, constituting 11.6 per cent of the population of developing countries, a little over half the level in 1990.
 Yet the achievements have not been uniform throughout the developing world.
 Per capita food production has actually declined in more than half of all developing countries over the past 15 years.
 In 18 countries with high rates of population growth, primarily in Africa, it has been deteriorating for the past three decades.
 While the Near East, North Africa, East Asia and Latin America/Caribbean regions are expected to achieve average food supplies of 3,000 calories per day by 2010, 200 million people will still be malnourished in South Asia and 300 million, or one-third of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, will suffer from severe food deficits.
 Due to rapidly expanding population, agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa would have to grow at four per cent annually in order significantly to improve per capita availability of food.
 Thus far, only East Asia has sustained such high growth rates in agriculture, averaging 6.1 per cent from 1970 to 1990.

 ‚ÄúQurrah!‚Äù Harruq shouted when his brother finally opened his eyes.
 ‚ÄúHow long?‚Äù Qurrah asked as he lurched onto his feet.
 ‚ÄúNot long,‚Äù Harruq said, holding Qurrah‚Äôs shoulder to steady him.
 ‚ÄúThe orcs are almost here.‚Äù
 As if on cue, they heard a collective roar from the south.
 Harruq glanced at the stairs along the wall, but Qurrah saw this and shook his head.
 ‚ÄúWe need to get closer to the fight,‚Äù Qurrah said, slurring his words.

Britney seemed to be getting suspicious that I wasn't really listening, so I had to make a lot of eye contact over the next few minutes.
 When I finally got a chance to look back up, Alec and his friends weren't at their table.
 Cassie caught my eye before I looked down, but she was definitely glaring.
 Not the typical I-hate-you-and-I'm-going-to-do-everything-I-can-to-smear-your-reputation-and-get-you-in-trouble-because-we're-in-high-school-and-that's-all-I can-really-do type glaring.
 Instead her eyes seemed to warn me never to go out alone at night because if she ever found me somewhere without any witnesses, they were going to have to hospitalize me.
 I felt a chill run through me, and dropped my eyes out of involuntary reflex.
 I probably would've started shaking if someone hadn't grabbed my shoulder and startled some kind of twisted cross between a shriek and a gasp out of me.
 I turned to give whoever it was a piece of my mind, but Brandon's laughing gray eyes made the words tangle up before they made it down to my tongue.
 "Hey there.

The Adapt was rough and the act was violent and Korin, in his new body, clearly enjoyed the violence more than the sex.
 After he had finished with the mother, he had the guards release the boy who had run over to his sobbing bleeding mother.
 In a fatherly gesture Korin had kissed the boy on the cheek and, wrapping his hands around the boy‚Äôs head in a slow loving gesture, made a quick yank and broke Join‚Äôs neck.
 The next day the guards released the young AElfin widow.
 Rodregas had helped drag her beyond the gates.
 She lay there not moving, limp though alive; she was dead in every way that mattered.
 Rodregas went back into the keep without looking back; he never knew what had happened to her after that.
 After dreaming every night about killing him, Rodregas now had Korin in his grip.
 It was time to end Korin‚Äôs vile pestilence on the world.
 Rodregas got behind him with his right hand covering his mouth, and with his left took a firm grip on the top of his head.

One of Brandon's people just got close enough to smell us.
 They left before we could tell for sure who it was, but the odds of them coming back with lots of help just went through the roof.
 If we're still around when they do, things will get ugly."
 Part of me wanted to break down into a gibbering wreck.
 The rest of me just nodded calmly, and turned to head upstairs as Isaac politely passed me, apparently on his way to the kitchen.
 Alec gently grasped my shoulder before I'd even managed to take a step.
 "There isn't time.
 We have to go now."
 As soon as we were out the front door, Alec motioned for me to jump on his back, and then we were off with a speed I suspected an Olympic athlete couldn't have matched.
 The lane between our house and the road flew by faster than I'd ever driven it in a car.

But they were also the happiest of people, which I couldn‚Äôt make sense of, until one afternoon when a mob of locals came to pick up groceries.
 These folks lived in a shantytown on the bank of an oily swamp I call the Black Lagoon.
 The neighborhood is so poor that when my cousin and I delivered a rusted tool shed to one of the families, they used it as a granny flat.
 I was helping the Brothers pass out vegetables when I got blessed with a feeling so profound, the recollection of it still uplifts me.
 These people I was helping, though not on my own but as a paid reporter, were blessing me.
 Like Curly did at Chapters Books.
 And like Mother Teresa blessed me.
 One Saturday a few years back, my friend Diane called.
 As a lay Missionary of Charity, she knew, and whispered to me, that Mother was around, visiting the MC houses in Tijuana and San Diego, in secret like she did, since she preferred not to get mobbed.
 The MCs rise early.

The growing demand for services in the developed world coupled with rapid strides in telecommunications has created the possibility of skipping steps to abridge the development process.
 Even within developing countries, surging demand for education, health care, tourism, communication, financial and retail services has opened up opportunities that were available to the developed countries only at a much later stage in their development.
 Outsourcing: During the last decade enormous attention has been focused on the lucrative employment potentials generated by Information and Communication Technology (ICT), particularly the high paid jobs in computer software and hardware and the less technical jobs in business process outsourcing.
 Countries such as India have shown that they can leapfrog into the technological vanguard by developing qualified human resources to meet the ever-expanding shortage in these sectors.
 Information Technology and IT-enabled services stand out as the most important new fields of employment to emerge since the popularization of the automobile.
 While the Commission‚Äôs report anticipated the importance of the information superhighway even before the World Wide Web radically transformed global communications, information exchange and commerce, ICPF did not foresee the dramatic impact that the Internet would have on the future export of service jobs to developing countries.
 The West has been exporting manufacturing jobs in large numbers for half a century, fuelling the growth of Japan, the East Asia tigers, and more recently China; but until the emergence of the information superhighway, the scope for export of service jobs was limited.
 Technological development has changed that.
 As a result, business process outsourcing has become one of the fastest growing sectors of the world economy.
 As growth of the labour force slows in high-income countries, there will be increasing pressure for export of service jobs.

Steve is now serving five years in prison.
 The last I heard about Ashley is that she is prostituting herself to support her drug habit.
 NARCONON: Information about Narconon is readily available on the Internet; the official site explains the theories of detoxification, based on the work of L. Ron Hubbard.
 Brandon: Sadly, as he neared the 2-year sobriety mark, Brandon relapsed.
 I immediately knew just by talking to him over the phone.
 I wouldn‚Äôt have noticed the changes in his behavior had I not come to know the new sober Brandon after his treatment at Narconon and his subsequent employment at the facility.
 Brandon reluctantly agreed to return to Narconon to try to discover ‚Äúwhat he had missed‚Äù but he didn‚Äôt go easily.
 Drug addicts are convinced that they can handle the issue themselves and believing that lie could prove deadly for them.
 Brandon spent three more months in treatment and is now trying again, living independently in a sober-living environment.
 Another defining moment for all of us.

I'd never been on a single date before Sanctuary, and you know all about what's happened since I arrived."
 His smile was surprisingly reassuring.
 "That sounds like the easiest one I've asked you yet.
 Why the sudden bashfulness?"
 My throat seemed to be spending an awful lot of the time lately constricted down to the point where speech was all but impossible.
 It was even worse than usual now.
 I thought maybe he'd have moved on to something else by the time I was able to talk again, but he was still patiently waiting when I managed to make myself look up again.
 It was tempting to lie and tell him I was just thinking about Cindi, the only one in the family who'd ever really had any luck in the dating department, but that wasn't fair.
 Besides, it would only put off the dreaded day.
 Eventually he'd find out what I was really like.

He shook the feeling off his hand and went back to the water closet and washed it in the water basin.
 Of course he knew there was nothing physically on his hand, but he also knew that water was a natural purifier and disrupted many magical influences.
 What he had felt was simply disgusting.
 Why would a book, no matter what its contents, have such a feel to it?
 He walked back to the book and got down on the ground.
 Without actually touching it, Rodregas slowly ran his fingertips along the binder of the book.
 While the feeling was not as strong as when he had held it, clearly the feeling of what could only be described as evil emanated from the book.
 Was this feeling truly coming from the book or was this some new ability of his new body to sense the nature of the book‚Äôs contents?
 Rodregas got up and walked over to the bookshelf.
 He closed his eyes and, trying not to touch, lightly ran his hands close to the row of books.

Qurrah closed his eyes and hoped no significant enchantments guarded the fence.
 If any did, they fizzled against the magic of the ancient sword.
 Harruq sliced two of the bars cleanly, and a third dented in enough so that a follow up chop cut it like butter.
 Pleased, Harruq took two of the bars into his hands.
 His neck bulged, his arm muscles tensed, and then the iron screeched backward.
 Both winced at the noise.
 They did not move for the next five minutes.
 When both felt comfortable, Harruq shoved the third bar forward, giving them a nice clean entrance.
 The two brothers slipped under, the bigger half-orc having to press his arms together to squeeze through.
 They slunk across the lawn to the front door.

 She gave me another tentative smile as I slid into the seat next to her.
 "I'm really sorry about yesterday.

 It's just I'm not supposed to talk about what Alec says."
 Wow, he sounded like even more of a jerk than I'd expected.

At first they didn‚Äôt believe her.
 Then they cried.
 By now, she had been gone three years.
 Over that time, she attended several churches and felt compelled to tell her story, since God wants his people to share our burdens with one another.
 At two churches she was informally but firmly shunned.
 The third church she was asked to leave.
 Though she didn‚Äôt explain, I suppose her expulsion resulted from her theory about evil being inside us all or from the fear she would infect the congregation with notions that could lead to an epidemic of broken marriages.
 At the end of her story, Curly comes over and gives her friend some reasons they need to move along.
 Before they leave, Curly reaches down and rubs my shoulder.
 As more evidence that I‚Äôm slow to catch on, I‚Äôll admit that not until I‚Äôm on my way, in the rain, to Seattle, do I realize Curly‚Äôs touch was the physical part of a blessing.

I half thought he was going to ride up front in the crowded cab, but he instead cleared the sides of the truck in a jump that was almost inhumanly graceful.
 He crowded in, close enough I could feel my skin start to tingle with anticipation, and then Vincent started the engine and we were off.
 In what was probably the only display of maturity and common sense I'd ever seen out of Vincent, he didn't tear off down the freeway at eighty miles per hour.
 He was still going plenty fast, but at least the wind wasn't deafening.
 After a few minutes of white-knuckled fear, I was finally able to relax a little, and enjoy the feeling of having Brandon so close while the wind tossed my hair back and forth.
 The other girls were studiously ignoring me while they gossiped back and forth about everyone from underclassmen to teachers and other adults in the town.
 I didn't want to join in the gossip, and Brandon was sprawled out on the pickup bed with his eyes closed.
 I settled for contemplating the glorious sunset's myriad colors.
 We passed some kind of border into one of the parks.
 Vincent slowed down a little more as I was busy taking in the incredible pinks and purples that were dominating the western sky.

I still couldn‚Äôt believe where I was going tomorrow.
 To Igneeria.
 Chapter 6
 I opened my eyes the next morning, the sun‚Äôs rays shinning through my bedroom window.
 I didn‚Äôt roll out of bed for a minute; instead I lay staring at the ceiling trying to prepare my brain for the day ahead.
 I heard my mom and dad walking downstairs, talking excitedly about where they thought I was going to go today.
 I rolled off my bed and walked sleepily over to my dresser to pull out a pair of jeans and a shirt.
 After I had pulled the shirt over my head, I grabbed my half empty traveling bag and headed down stairs.
 I dropped my bag near the door and walked over to the kitchen table.
 My mom had placed a full plate of eggs and toast on the table; I sat down and started to eat.

There was just enough light for me to see Alec lean forward and put a hand on each troublemaker's shoulder.
 There was an abortive movement by the two loudmouths, as they tried to spin around and confront him.
 Granted, the lighting was less than ideal, but it didn't look like Alec was holding onto them very hard.
 Still, neither of them made it more than a quarter of the way around before being slammed back down into their chairs.
 The tingly heat that'd convinced me Alec was staring at me earlier was back, and even more intense.
 I felt the tiny hairs on my neck stand up as the feeling redoubled yet again.
 The darker, more vocal of the two opened his mouth and got the first part of a swear word out before ending in a hiss of pain that was almost completely drowned out by a crescendo from the orchestra pit.
 Alec leaned forward, whispered something in each of their ears, and then finally let both of them go.
 I expected them to turn around swinging, or at least swear at him.
 I didn't expect them to remain in their seats stunned and shaking like trauma victims.

Is this our destination?
 My gaze shot up to find the village, and then I hastily clicked my heels when I realized I was being left behind.
 As we advanced, I could see movement amongst the elves.
 There was much activity, but it was nothing like home.
 No flags of quilts and rugs blowing in the breeze, no bright sunlight on a rainbow of colors, no dancing in the village center.
 A raucous sound traveled up to us and Chevelle waved a hand, his magic bringing the hood of my cloak up to cover my head and then his own.
 At once, my stomach was a knot again.
 We rode into town at a walk; Chevelle was sitting straight and tall in his saddle but his arm hung casually, hand resting on his leg.
 I was more comfortable watching him, looking for a reaction, than the passing elves.
 Two men walked by in the opposite direction, their dark eyes on us.

Dearest Elfreda, I must away without saying goodbye.
 I am sure you cannot understand, but please trust in me.
 Don this immediately.
 ‚ÄîJ.
 I tugged at the tie and the string fell away.
 I sucked in air as I opened the lid.
 It seemed like I couldn‚Äôt quite catch my breath anymore.
 Reaching inside to draw out the long white gown, I could not fathom Junnie‚Äôs reasoning.
 But she must have gone through much to get me this package.
 Numbly, I stared at her words while I unfastened my shirt and sash.

 CM: 	Well, run us through the specifics.
 What happened after the album?
 BG: 	Ok, so we got a local reputation, a sort of groundswell, that started small and then ran along the faultline that runs under the Bluff City.
 We were what they call an underground success, what Memphis specializes in.
 We were talked about but you had to be part of the cognoscenti, the insiders.

 Qurrah did, his eyes red and his face wet.
 ‚ÄúYes master?‚Äù he asked.
 No weakness tainted his voice.
 The man in black put a hand on either side of Qurrah‚Äôs face and drew him close.
 ‚ÄúBecome a god among men,‚Äù he whispered.
 ‚ÄúRemain faithful to me, and to Karak, and I shall see it come to pass.‚Äù
 Qurrah nodded but said nothing.
 Instead, he turned and joined his brother.

Superior power must bring with it a superior sense of fairness and a commitment to constructive dialogue and action to attack the root causes of terrorism.
 It must shed its own accretion of mental insincerity cloaked as diplomacy.
 Then and then only these movements of violence will shrink and finally disappear.
 The period following September 11th, as US National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice put it, is one ‚Äúnot just of grave danger, but of enormous opportunity.‚Äù
 Resolving Local Conflicts: The Commission concluded that the end of the Cold War made it possible to successfully resolve problems that had resisted solution for decades, such as the many violent communal and ethnic conflicts occurring in the world.
 The near total cessation of violence in North Ireland during the past 10 years is proof that rapid progress can be made on issues involving apparently intractable communal sentiments.
 This achievement appears astounding to those who lived through the earlier decades of religious violence and until recently found it nearly impossible to imagine a mitigation of the conflict in the foreseeable future.
 We would do well to examine closely this instance to draw lessons that may aid in addressing those conflicts that continue to defy resolution.
 The most striking lesson of the Irish experience is that rapid development absorbs and dissipates the urge for violence.
 The dramatic economic advancement of the Republic of Ireland ‚Äì whose per capita GDP rose within the past 20 years from less than 60 per cent that of UK to 95 per cent in dollar terms and 130 per cent in terms of purchasing power parity ‚Äì has eliminated the disparity between Ireland and Ulster and fostered among the Irish in both countries a sense of pride, an expansion of employment opportunities, and a more focused channelling of social energies into productive activities.

Harruq did so unwillingly.
 ‚ÄúI am Velixar,‚Äù he continued.
 ‚ÄúI am the voice of Karak.
 I‚Äôve heard much about you, Harruq Tun, bastard child of an orcish womb.
 You are strong, and I sense your anger raging to be unleashed.‚Äù
 Harruq trembled, indeed feeling that anger.
 He felt it deep inside his chest, urging him to rise and defy Velixar.
 ‚ÄúThe orcish were elves who swore their lives to Karak.
 Part of you still yearns to do what your ancestors have done.
 They reveled in bloodshed, warred against men who followed a false god.

But he was willing to bet that she had no idea where they'd been headed, and she was so passionate that she might have yielded to him without even thinking.

The recommendations set forth in this report are based on the conviction that nothing less than a legal commitment of the society to guarantee employment is justified and nothing less will be sufficient to solve the problem.
 Only then can the requisite political will be generated to push through effective measures.
 We do not advocate a return to state socialism or expansion of the public sector.
 As in the case of the environment, the changes needed are in the priority given to achieving different social objectives in the formulation of government policy.
 Recommendations to Achieve Full Employment in Industrial Nations
 Earlier we noted long-term trends that suggest the recent rise in unemployment in the West does not necessarily forebode, and need not necessarily result in, chronically higher rates of unemployment in these countries.
 Granted that the necessary political and social commitment is forthcoming, there are a range of strategies which, taken in the proper measure and combination, can dramatically accelerate job growth and reduce unemployment.
 Each of these strategies has proved effective in stimulating employment, though none by itself may be sufficient to solve the problem.
 A comprehensive, total approach, rather than partial and half-way measures, is needed.
 No industrial country can claim that it systematically exploits all the potential benefits of the strategies in this list.

"She's beautiful.
 It's how I always imagined an angel would appear."
 Alec was silent for so long I finally tore my gaze from his masterpiece long enough to find that he was staring at me with surprise.
 "It's you, Adri.
 Of course it's beautiful."
 For a second I couldn't breathe.
 It seemed so utterly impossible.
 Maybe it could've been a painting of Cindi, but not one of me.
 I couldn't possibly be the gorgeous figure he'd brought to life on his canvas.
 I opened my mouth to protest, and then the expression on her face finally registered for me.

Also, it was hard not to notice the borderline hostile stares from the other kids.
 I sighed in relief when the bell rang, and pulled out my schedule and map to see where I'd be going next.
 Physics?
 I mentally reviewed my conversation with the secretary, but couldn't remember either of us mentioning the class.
 As if trying to catch up in Algebra wasn't going to be bad enough, I was going to face the same kind of problem in physics.
 Grumbling to myself, I promised to try and switch into something better first thing tomorrow morning.
 The class was in a section of the building I hadn't been to yet, one apparently older than the rest of the building.
 The lights were spaced further apart and the cinder blocks in the walls were a slightly different size.
 Good thing I still had my water.
 The old part of the school was just as hot as the rest.

But once you are raised from Page to Squire as he had been, you always got to keep the title of Squire.
 Squires who were not raised to knighthood were much sought after; their martial training and their education, especially in law and etiquette, were a great foundation for many careers.
 As Rodregas knelt on the ground balancing the sword across his arms, and the sun warm on his face, he thought back to that time when he had used his Squire title to get into the officer academy in the Ramig Empire.
 Though giving up his dream of becoming a Knight of the Soaring Heavens had been hard, Rodregas had thought that he would become a successful officer in the army.
 Unfortunately, things had gone far amiss and he had never known success.
 Rodregas shook his head.
 He was focusing on the distant past, not his duty.
 That is what this meditation was all about, so what was his duty now?
 Killing Immortalists was not something that he, or even the three of them together, could just start doing.
 The problem was not just the individual Immortalist; many an angry town would have killed the local Immortalist Sorcerer after having their people taken.

Wondering why, after I had spilled my guts, he appeared to revel in my further humiliation, I flew into a rage, sprang to my knees, and socked him in the stomach.
 I pounced on top of him and socked him again, before he caught hold and flipped me, lashed my arm behind my back and shoved my face into the floor.
 ‚ÄúListen,‚Äù he said, without a hint of condemnation, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not really mad at me.
 You‚Äôre mad at yourself, because you think you‚Äôre nobody, but you‚Äôve got it all wrong.

I frantically searched for some explanation.
 But he didn‚Äôt speak.
 He flipped his arm, dismissing me.
 The tension showed in that small movement and I blanched.
 I started to pull away from the guard but he didn‚Äôt release me.
 I realized then I hadn‚Äôt been dismissed.
 It had been a direction for the guard.
 He wrenched me beside him, jerking unnecessarily, and then shoved me through the door to my room.
 I listened, but his steps did not recede.
 I tried the door; it was already bound.

I shook my head.
 "I'm not leaving.
 I believe you when you say my going back to Brandon won't solve anything, but I'm not going to run away and leave you all to deal with the mess I created.
 I wish you'd stop asking me to."
 His gaze was long and steady, but finally he nodded.
 "You have as much right to see this through as anyone else does, but it's almost certainly going to get a lot uglier before it's over.
 Your freedom is going to be incredibly restricted, at least as bad as it was today.
 We'll escort you to school, stay just long enough to ensure we don't get in trouble, and then hurry back to our territory.
 At least if Brandon's pack does come after us there, we're within our rights to do something about it."
 I opened my mouth to comment on the fact that Brandon's pack was roughly twice the size of ours, only to realize that scurrying back home kind of precluded continuing to help out at the tutor lab.

Qurrah waited until Harruq was around the corner before taking out one of his small glass vials.
 Before he could pull the cork off the top, he heard a voice speak.
 ‚ÄúSo many dead by your hands yet a single arrow nearly takes your life?‚Äù
 The half-orc froze, the vial clutched in his hands.
 An elf emerged from behind the building, his body decorated in a brilliant green cloak and silvery armor.
 It was the same elf who had fired the first warning shot to Antonil before the entire battle had begun.
 ‚ÄúI am but a poor outcast,‚Äù Qurrah said, hiding the handle of the whip underneath the palm of his hand.
 The coiled leather vibrated, hungering for blood.
 ‚ÄúDo not lie to me.
 I have watched you two slaughter my brethren.

 I smiled at Rachel and then flipped open my math book.
 Everything went just like normal, and promptly at five I closed my binder and started stuffing books into my backpack.
 I looked up to find Rachel standing in front of my table.
 "Are you ready?
 James had to leave early, but don't worry, we've still got a ride home."
 I think I managed to keep the disappointment off of my face.
 Rachel at least didn't seem to notice.

As their eyes held he slid over to her, running the back of his hand across her cheek.
 ‚ÄúYou are so beautiful, your skin so soft,‚Äù Rodregas said.
 ‚ÄúYou are the complete woman; beautiful, intelligent, brave.‚Äù He reached down and placed his finger below her chin and raised it up to be equal in height to his.
 ‚ÄúI have wanted you since I first saw you,‚Äù and with that straight forward statement, he reached down, and holding her face steady with his single finger, he slowly, softly kissed her.
 For a moment she tried to pull away, but he kept the pressure of his finger steady and firm so she could feel his desire.
 He made his lips eager but light, not too forceful.
 He was strong and he let her feel his strength, but he also gave her plenty of leverage so that if she truly wanted to pull away she could.
 He was making his desire clear, but the decision was hers.
 He cared for her too much, and was so determined to walk the path of righteousness and he was determined to be very careful.
 A younger man would have been in a hurry.

 Marie dressed quickly, hoping she could get to the garden before Rick woke up.
 She didn't know how she could look him in the eye this morning.
 She'd been so hurt last night when he'd refused to kiss her and told her to go to bed, but now she was embarrassed when she thought about how she'd pleaded with him to keep kissing her.
 But .

Some of it went into his lungs, but he kept them still.
 Qurrah reclined, closed his eyes, and let the potion do its work.
 He could feel the magic flowing through his body, concentrating about his ruined throat.
 Part of him hoped the liquid would heal the damage done so many years ago, but he knew better.
 A scar that old was beyond repair.
 He would have to settle for surviving.
 That was just fine with him.
 When he finally dared a loud, gasping breath of air, the pain was not so bad.
 Qurrah stood, picked up his whip, and then went to help his brother.
 He expected to see his body dead in the street, for why else had he still not returned?

‚ÄúI let you down at the creek.‚Äù His gaze fell to my hands, which closed instinctively into fists, protecting the newly-scarred palms.
 ‚ÄúI was distracted.
 I should have been paying closer attention.
 I should have prevented this.‚Äù Regret was thick in his voice.
 I could only stare at him, mystified.
 He explained, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too late now.
 You‚Äôll never rest until you‚Äôve followed the map.‚Äù He was wrong; I‚Äôd forgotten my plans, surrendered to my captor.
 I had thought it was over.
 ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I answered boldly, the word echoing with the thrum of my pulse.
 It made no sense, but I didn‚Äôt take the time to think it through, didn‚Äôt give him a chance to change his mind.

How dare you?‚Äù Then he said a single word and from his mouth poured a huge wind, Doi‚Äôvan flayed around trying to hold on to Van‚Äôdret, but he lost his grip and hit the ceiling hard.
 Rodregas crunched the fingers he was holding and heard them snap, even as he was being pushed away.
 With the snapping of the fingers the wind stopped.
 Rodregas then dropped the hand, grabbed Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs head and twisted.
 He remembered that day in Raven Tower when he had snapped Korin‚Äôs neck and his arms bunched up, his muscles rippling with the strain.
 Van‚Äôdret was an Immortalist.
 His neck did not snap easily, but it snapped.
 Rodregas did not stop snapping it until he had the man‚Äôs face looking into the rock below.
 The three sat there for a minute and then stepped away to rest against the far wall to get some distance from Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs body.
 After a few minutes Doi‚Äôvan said, ‚ÄúWell, one more Immortalist down, that‚Äôs good.‚Äù The other two nodded.

‚ÄúShe is elf.
 I name her‚Ä¶ Elfreda.‚Äù
 My heart had stopped.
 And then it surged as blood rushed to my face, my neck.
 My ears rang.
 I must have been speaking or cursing.
 I could hear the sound, but could not make sense of it.
 Nothing made sense.
 I was standing before I knew I was surrounded.
 Fury and fire swam in my head, my chest, my hands.

‚ÄúCome,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúWe must go north where we are needed most.‚Äù
 The two ran through the town, listening for sounds of battle.
 The worst seemed to be about the middle of Celed and steadily working its way south.
 They encountered a few soldiers as they hurried there.
 All died before they had the chance to swing their blades.
 ‚ÄúAt last!‚Äù Felewen cried, staring out from a side alley.
 They were behind a group of ten soldiers battling a pair of elven warriors who stood back to back.
 ‚ÄúMake haste, they need us!‚Äù
 Felewen charged, desperate to arrive before her brethren were overwhelmed.

Ruby continued without pause.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard by now I‚Äôm an amalgamation, a half-breed.‚Äù She said the last part with distaste and glanced at Steed.
 ‚ÄúI will give you a short version of events so when the subject comes up‚Äîand believe me, someone will ask‚Äîyou are not overcome by curiosity and forced to seek less than honorable venues to discover the facts.‚Äù I chose to ignore the jab about my eavesdropping.
 ‚ÄúMy mother was a power-hungry wench seeking notoriety.
 She was an elemental fairy and, like me, sported a fine head of red hair.‚Äù She ran a hand under the curls for emphasis.
 ‚ÄúShe heard a story one day of a mixed-species birth and got it in her head she could breed a more powerful magic.
 Apparently she thought she could control her offspring and use the magic to her advantage‚Ä¶ I suppose she thought she could rule the world.‚Äù Ruby smirked.
 ‚ÄúShe studied various species for a few moons and decided her best chance at conquest was a dark elf.
 She made her way to this very village and happened across my father, poor unsuspecting sap.‚Äù Ruby flitted her fingers, glasses and wine served before each of us as she continued.
 ‚ÄúSo there he was and she, just a wisp of a woman, flew up to him and blew a little fairy dust‚Ä¶ well, you know about that.‚Äù I narrowed my eyes at her.

 Telling me that I am unconditionally loved by that a man several centuries dead is supposed to cure all my ills?
 How does that work?

I tried to see my attacker, to think of the magic to protect myself.
 ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù It would have been a yell it if wasn‚Äôt hissed.
 The tone was harsh and I recognized it at once.

 Part of me was saying calm down, but the other was screaming I was still in danger.

 He released his grip just a fraction.
 ‚ÄúI went to your room and you were gone.‚Äù He shook his head.
 ‚ÄúI thought I had to come out here to get a search party.‚Äù ‚ÄúI, uh‚Ä¶ you were in my room?‚Äù He straightened, his expression making it clear he hadn‚Äôt expected that response.

Then his cousin is slain bearing a message to this town, his head left at the gate of our city.
 Paranoia it might be, but it is justified.‚Äù
 Antonil quieted.
 Dieredon watched him, amazed just how young the man could still look in the moonlight.
 He was a year beyond forty, yet he commanded the entire Neldaren army.
 Publicly, he handled the weight wonderfully, but when prying eyes were gone, his all-too-human fear and doubt showed.
 When the man spoke again, his voice trembled.
 ‚ÄúI will not break my oaths.
 His Majesty asked I enforce his edict, and so I shall.‚Äù

Search for a New Model
 Ironically, despite all the international debate about transition, thus far the actual goal of the transition process has never been clearly spelled out.
 It is widely presumed to be to some form of capitalist system, but which variety ‚Äì the Swedish?
 The Japanese?
 The American?
 Although the ostensible goal of transition has been to economies based on private ownership, three years after the initiation of transition programmes, very little privatization has actually taken place in most countries of the region.
 It is widely believed that acceleration of this process will lead to rising unemployment and a widening gap between the rich and the poor, leading to the creation of a huge under class that had been virtually eradicated in previous decades.
 Is this result really the best these countries can hope for in the foreseeable future?
 The events in Eastern Europe have been widely hailed as a victory for democratic capitalism over authoritarian communism.
 The obvious failure of the latter has been used to support the claim of the former to be the sole political and economic heir to the next millennium.

They'll never waste a thought on you or me, or pretty much anyone."
 The way she said their names implied they were a couple.
 Even if they weren't, she was probably right about not getting my hopes up.
 Especially considering the way Alec had looked at me there at the end.
 Despite my best efforts the question still slipped out.
 "They're together then?"
 Britney smirked.
 "You really are masochistic, aren't you?
 That's the rumor.
 Nobody really seems to know, at least nobody who's talking, but they're almost always together.

I was unsure how long I‚Äôd slept but it looked like the sun was rising again and I wanted to be out of the house before I ran into Fannie.
 It was probably too early to hope to see Chevelle.
 I‚Äôd spent the last two days with him, but he hadn‚Äôt revealed anything of himself and that had only made me more curious.
 I retrieved the documents I‚Äôd hidden after my second trip to the library to find out whether they added anything to the report from the Council‚Äôs record-keeper.
 There wasn‚Äôt much new there, mostly more names, but I did notice a watermark on one of the pages.
 I held it up to the light to better see.
 It was a Council marking and something else.
 I dug out the first pages from under my mattress and examined them closer.
 The pages directly from the record-keeper‚Äôs report all included the same Council mark plus a string of characters.
 Trying to decode them, I realized one of the symbols might simply be a page number.

He looked down at her with chagrin.
 "I didn't even think about that.
 I'm sorry, Marie--we should have gone shopping sooner.
 And I should have shown you how to use the washer and dryer.
 I'll do that tomorrow."
 "But we're going to the shore."
 "I'll show you when we get home.
 Come on--let's go buy you some more outfits."
 He insisted on buying her a pair of pants, a dress, two t-shirts, and two pairs of shorts.
 "But Rick, what if I get back to 1927 tomorrow?"

Jumping out of bed, she dressed as quickly as she could and ran downstairs and into the garden.
 It was just past dawn and not as foggy as it had been yesterday.
 She made herself stop running, certain that speed had nothing to do with going 84 years backwards.
 She began walking in the direction from which she'd come yesterday.
 Or from which she thought she'd come, anyway.
 How would she know if she'd gotten back?
 Surely she'd be able to recognize her own home.
 But what if she got back to 1927 but not to her house?
 She could go up to someone's house and ask .

He reached out and took my hand in his, his fingers gentle as he turned it palm up to place a pebble there.
 ‚ÄúCan you do anything with this?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Frustration was clear in my voice.
 I had already tried.
 ‚ÄúAnd no fire?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo nothing works?‚Äù The implication was there, but I didn‚Äôt know what it meant right away.
 And then it occurred to me.
 The horse.
 I had thought he had shown up because I‚Äôd impressed upon him to follow before I blacked out, but I had already been bound again at that point.
 Should I tell Chevelle?
 I didn‚Äôt know why I felt so protective of this secret.
 Chevelle drew a section of moss from one of the stones on the wall and it replaced the pebble.

I couldn‚Äôt blame them.
 Steed‚Äôs voice was low, wary.
 ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt mean you, Frey.‚Äù I turned, unable to stand the bloody vision in my peripheral.
 The tracker‚Äôs words waited in Chevelle‚Äôs hand.
 ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said, feeling slightly detached from myself.
 ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs try it.‚Äù Chevelle‚Äôs disbelief was more than evident as he shot back, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Ruby spoke up.
 ‚ÄúIt could be a trick.
 He‚Äôll need to try it on someone else first.‚Äù Someone else?
 Who else was bound?
 She could see I was prepared to argue.

All three heads roared and the wings started to beat and the dragon seemed to actually fly for a second.
 For just a brief moment there were two daemon dragons.
 Then one of them fell toward the ground only to sink into the shape of Doi‚Äôvan.
 Doi‚Äôvan staggered and Rodregas reached out and caught him to keep him from falling.
 Apparently, being a three headed daemon dragon did not include a cat-like ability to land from a fall.
 Rodregas steadied him and then Doi‚Äôvan shook himself and looked around, confused.
 ‚ÄúAre you all right?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 Doi‚Äôvan nodded and then said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get out of the chamber.‚Äù Rodregas nodded, as he wanted to check on Imeralda.
 Doi‚Äôvan seemed to have his balance back.
 Rodregas wondered if Doi‚Äôvan had lost his balance because he had been trying to fly instead of walk.

Some say it sounded like The Rascals crossed with Hot Tuna.
 One cut comes to mind, a piece they played in every set at The Shell, the ballad, ‚ÄúMr.
 Handy and Hakel-B√§rend.‚Äù  On the LP they insisted on the extended version with Buddy‚Äôs long, side-handed solos, slick as molten lead and the twelve minute drum solo by Skippy Quetzalcoatl, effectively killing the album‚Äôs potential sales but insuring the group a spot in infamy alongside the lost tapes of Mudboy and the Neutrons and the missing five hours of von Stroheim‚Äôs Greed.
 There was also the shorter, ‚ÄúBlues for Wendy Ward,‚Äù with its plaintive chorus, ‚ÄúThank you for at least that sweet ache,‚Äù a phrase Buddy made sound like a supplication to the gods.
 ‚ÄúWendy Ward‚Äù got some air play around the country, on the late night FM stations, a minor flickering fame which only whet Buddy‚Äôs appetite for more, for larger radio audiences, larger followings, more groupies, better food backstage.
 He wanted it all, Buddy did.
 No one asked him, What is all?
 If they had he might be here today.
 Who can say?
 Pigpen‚Äôs gone.

 But I can still speak to you because you have to complete the job I did before with my friends.‚Äù ‚ÄúWow, back up a second,‚Äù I said quickly.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre dead?‚Äù She tapped her foot impatiently.
 ‚ÄúDo you know how long ago I defeated Kojas?
 It must have been over one hundred years ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúWow, that was a long time ago,‚Äù I said.
 ‚ÄúYou defeated Kojas?‚Äù June sighed in frustration.
 ‚ÄúDid you pay any attention to anything?
 Mackenzie, David, Mark and I beat Kojas the first time he appeared.

‚ÄúI ask again, Elfreda, who taught you the magic to seal yourself to the crystal?‚Äù I was at a loss.
 I stood, helpless, as Chevelle spoke up.
 ‚ÄúElfreda.‚Äù He‚Äôd used my given name, I hoped simply because we were in a formal setting and not because of whatever horrible thing I had been accused of.
 He was pleading now.
 ‚ÄúWhere did you learn how to fuse the pendant with your blood?‚Äù Fuse the pendant with my blood?
 What was he talking about?
 I heard someone behind me.
 ‚Äú‚Ä¶ how did she know to keep it from being removed?‚Äù And someone else.
 ‚Äú‚Ä¶ who even left it with her?‚Äù It came together then, the feeling I‚Äôd had when I woke and placed it around my neck, the part of the dream I‚Äôd shaken off as I stood before the basin washing up, cleaning the blood from my hands, from the pendant.
 I wanted to explain, tell of what I‚Äôd seen in the dream, but it was foggy and I was too slow to pull it into thought.

Brandon flashed me another smile and quickly maneuvered his car through a U-turn, a feat I was fairly certain was harder than it looked in the bulky muscle car.
 "No harm done.
 You guys bought the old Anderson home then?"
 I nodded, staring out at the desolate landscape.
 "You mean every single person in town doesn't already know everything there is to know about us?"
 "Oh, the joys of a small town.
 Yeah, with as little real news as we get out here, people probably know more about you than you're used to.
 It has its benefits though."
 I snorted, and then felt myself turning red with embarrassment.
 You would think after seventeen years I'd have learned how to laugh without making those wretched sounds.

Rodregas struggled to keep his arm from spasming in pain.
 He knew that Jordaan could not really keep his arm from moving.
 He kept thinking that the ordeal would be over soon.
 When it continued he started to worry about his ability to keep from jerking away from the small figurine.
 Just when he was sure that he could not keep his arm still the pain smoothed and stopped.
 As Jordaan relaxed his grip and released him, Rodregas shook his arm and then his body, trying to feel the difference.
 It felt almost like someone had drawn all over him from the inside, but there was no visible difference.
 There was no sign that a bit of his magic had been used up in the creation of a permanent effect.
 Rodregas sat and watched as Doi‚Äôvan and then Imeralda undertook the inscription of the minor sigil.
 From Rodregas‚Äô perspective the next two seemed to withstand the pain a lot better than then he had.

Please kiss me again."
 His groan was deeper this time, and he turned away from her, dropping his head into his hands.
 "Please go to bed, Marie."
 "But Rick--" "Just go to bed.
 Please."
 He didn't look up when she finally complied.
 He'd never known such ecstatic misery.
 He wanted her so much that, 20 minutes after she'd gone, his hands were still trembling.
 Was he a fool?
 She'd begged him to keep kissing her.

The camera was apparently second and last to his need for drugs‚Äîduh‚Äî like everything else.
 I knew I couldn‚Äôt be the first parent who paid off the loan on a child‚Äôs prized belongings.
 I did know that it would remain my camera until he could pay back everything he owed and prove to me he was sober.
 It broke my heart that I was retrieving something from hock that we had given him as the perfect gift to inspire him, and that it had ended up helping fund his drug habit.
 It broke my heart that my Brandon was a drug addict.
 Agenda Item Three: Confront Brandon directly with an intervention.
 The family intervention included me, Bryce, Harry, Anabel, Lisa and even the arresting officer, Denny White, via phone.
 The intervention started with the assumption that Brandon was currently detoxing (for the second time) with us at home, and there were expectations everyone had of him.
 Brandon was attacked by all sides; the room was heated with Brandon‚Äôs denial and lies.
 He lied and denied because that is what drug addicts do.

Of course I did make a couple of stipulations."
 The music started up before I could ask what he meant.
 Almost before I realized what was going on, I found myself twirling through some kind of modified waltz.
 For the first time in my life, I was glad Dad had drilled me for all of those weeks when I'd turned twelve.
 My first dance had still been complete and utter misery, but at least I managed not to trip over my own feet as Alec led me around the room in time to archaic music.
 The rest of the pack fell into formation around us, all dancing much more proficiently than me.
 James and Dominic led the way, with Jasmin and Rachel dancing off to our left.
 Amazingly enough, Isaac and Jessica were far and away the best; he was leading her through steps that were at least twice as hard as anything we were trying.
 For maybe the first time I'd ever seen, Jessica was happy.
 She seemed completely in her element, utterly oblivious to the number of people watching her every move, and I felt just a little of my resentment dissolve.

No one had ever been as sweet to her or as thoughtful as Rick.
 "Morning."
 Marie jumped, looking up at Rick.
 "Good morning."
 She glanced out the window and realized she must have been sitting there for nearly 30 minutes.
 "Have you been out to the garden already?"
 "No."
 She stood and went to him.
 "I want to go home--" "I know, sweetheart."
 He caressed her hair, wishing he knew how to comfort her.

 He couldn't believe what he was hearing.

 She was so small and slender that he'd just assumed she was small busted.

 It was not long before they saw the firelight in the distance.
 ‚ÄúCan you run, brother?‚Äù Harruq asked.
 ‚ÄúNo, I cannot.
 The night is long.

When the battle comes, slaughter the elves from behind.
 You must weaken them enough so that Vaelor‚Äôs army has a chance at victory.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúWhere will we meet you?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúListen for where the screams are at their worst,‚Äù Velixar said as his shadow began to fade.
 ‚ÄúThere shall I be.‚Äù
 A pale hand reached inside his robes and pulled out five glass vials.
 Qurrah knelt and accepted the gifts.
 ‚ÄúThe vials contain powerful healing elixirs.
 If either of you are injured tomorrow, drink from them and resume the slaughter anew.‚Äù

He does take care of most of the duties a typical butler would assume, but he's also our financial manager and long-time family friend.
 I'm excited for you to meet him tomorrow.
 I think you'll like him."
 "Yeah, but will he like me?"
 I sat up in bed, excited to finally be getting real details about Alec's life.
 "Please lie back down.
 You have to at least be trying to sleep.
 Otherwise I'm heading back downstairs.
 And don't pout.
 It won't influence me in the slightest."

I was going to walk, and that was it.
 Maybe if I passed out on the side of the road and ended up in the hospital Britney would finally realize what a wench she was.
 I was barely out of sight of the school, still vividly imagining Alec and Britney's faces when they found out that they'd put me in the hospital, when I heard a car approaching from behind me.
 Only it wasn't zipping by, it was slowing down.
 Every scary story I'd ever heard about rapists, kidnappers and murderers suddenly flowed through my mind like frayed ropes catching at my insides as they went, pulling out all of the other thoughts and feelings until there was nothing left but a hollow, fear-filled shell.
 I found myself praying for the first time since the accident, pleading with whatever might be out there listening to protect me and get me safely home.
 My heart was pounding so hard it almost drowned out the crunch of gravel as the car pulled even with me.
 I didn't recognize the vehicle, which was a bad sign.
 It was a light-eating black, and emitted the throaty roar of a sports car.
 The windows were tinted; I could see that much out of the corner of my eye without acknowledging that it was there.

He was probably wondering how Rodregas could be strong enough to take on an Immortal Guard.
 Rodregas knew from the guard‚Äôs fear that he had him, he was not thinking clearly.
 Rodregas growled at him, letting him feel his anger and rage at taking slaves to be used by the Immortalists.
 Rodregas had seen what would happen to them.
 He had suffered for years with a subtle kind of inner rot at letting the evil continue.
 In all the ways that mattered Rodregas knew he was no better than this man, he had spent most of his life as a slaver.
 Rodregas had no moral grounds on which to kill these men, but inside of him there was no mercy.
 He had crossed a line and could no longer live with the evil.
 Rodregas let go of the guard‚Äôs shield.
 He did not have the angle to grab his opponent‚Äôs throat.

The two dug through dressers upstairs, grabbing old and expensive robes and shirts.
 They then dragged the body outside to where the deceased elf had kept a private garden.
 Thick brick walls guarded against any prying eyes.
 They dug a large hole in a corner and then bled the body dry, letting the fluids soak into the dirt.
 Occasionally, they would halt and listen, worried their violent struggle had reached unwanted ears.
 No curious investigators arrived, however, and they continued with their dark deed.
 When the blood dripping from the elf‚Äôs wounds became but a trickle, they filled the hole and moved on.
 Using the clothes and robes from upstairs, the two brothers wiped away as much of Ahrqur‚Äôs blood as they could.
 They tossed the bloody clothes, the table, and the pieces of glass they into the fireplace and burned them.
 Harruq wrapped the body in spare blankets he found in a closet.

Private sector investment in training will prove in adequate unless it is encouraged by incentives or complemented by greater public investment in this sector.
 Information Superhighways
 Information promotes political freedom, economic development and social justice.
 The transforming power of information under glasnost opened up Soviet society to events in the outer world and created widespread awareness of the alternative approaches and achievements of other nations.
 Information brought down the Berlin Wall, ended the Cold War and ushered the world into a new era.
 Information about economic opportunities and potentials is an essential ingredient, a catalyst, of the development process.
 In the past, development strategies have tended to place too little emphasis on the power of public awareness to release people‚Äôs energies and initiative on a massive scale.
 The vast accumulation of knowledge and new technology for rapid dissemination of information that the world possesses today can be utilized to increase the speed of change, eliminate many false starts and wrong turns and much unnecessary suffering.
 The goals and strategies recommended in this report aim to accelerate the process of political, social and economic development by creating greater public awareness of desirable and achievable objectives and releasing the initiative of individuals and institutions to pursue them more vigorously.
 Information is the most powerful catalyst for this process.

The right side of my body hummed and tingled, almost imperceptibly, telling me he was there.
 I did my best to ignore the sensation, concentrating on the pictures rapidly forming on the ancient blackboard as Mrs. Alexander diagrammed the conceptual model of a wave, and started dissecting the various parts.
 Crest, trough, period, amplitude.
 None of it was hard to understand, not particularly interesting, but still a welcome distraction.
 After what seemed like an eternity, Mrs. Alexander placed the piece of chalk she was using behind her other ear and smiled at the class.
 "Okay, that's your introduction to light.
 Form up into your usual groups and take a project summary; you'll be working on this for the next few days."
 I joined the class in filing past the teacher's desk, and then watched as everyone started moving desks around.
 Mrs. Alexander saw me walking hesitantly back to my desk, and intercepted me before I could get there.

Alec's stride was so smooth it was hard to believe we weren't still back in the classroom.
 "Put me down, I mean please put me down."
 Those clear, deep eyes met mine for a second, seeming to look past the surface and all the way down to the bleeding mental gash that'd just triggered my most recent collapse.
 I was trying to marshal my arguments, but his eyes wiped my mind clean.
 I couldn't form another coherent thought until he shook his head and looked away.
 "You need to see the nurse."
 My mind hiccupped for a second.
 There should be some kind of law requiring him to hide those things.
 Sunglasses, or maybe a blindfold.
 "I'm fine.

If we don't take care of it now it may be another week or two before we have a chance, and Donovan will be severely disappointed in both of us."
 They were both smiling now, as if at some shared joke, but that didn't help defuse the sudden feeling of nervousness sweeping through me.
 Rachel followed us down a series of corridors, and then waited as Alec knocked on a plain, oak door.
 A half-second passed, and then responding to something too faint for me to hear, Alec gently opened the door.
 A slightly tilted eyebrow seemed to ask Rachel if she wanted to come inside, but she shook her head, now with the slightest of quivers to her chin.
 Whatever I was expecting from Alec and Rachel's reactions, I didn't get it.
 The airy, sunlit room we walked into was almost like being outside.
 There were a number of plants scattered about the space, some resting on the floor, others on a variety of slender stands.
 The effect was ethereal.
 It was hard to imagine that any of the spun-metal stands could support anything more substantial than a box of Kleenex.

Their race could see as well in night as in day.
 That same racial ability allowed the two brothers to watch the approaching orcs, lean muscle bulging underneath their sweat-glistened pale gray skin.
 Some wore mismatched armor, though most had only skulls, straps of leather, and war paint covering their bodies.
 Wave after wave of arrows rained upon them, and those who fell were trampled by the rest, but the masses were not even slowed.
 Harruq pointed past the army to where a long line of men stood in the distance, carrying no light or torch.
 ‚ÄúWhat are they doing?‚Äù he asked.
 Qurrah searched the line, and he saw what he suspected.
 ‚ÄúThe necromancer,‚Äù he observed, pointing to the black shape hidden underneath robes and a hood.
 ‚ÄúThose alongside him are dead, Harruq.
 They serve only him.‚Äù

Caught up in the evening's enchantment, she gazed up into his eyes, hoping he'd kiss her again.
 But Davis stepped back and turned to draw her arm through his, grinding his teeth.
 He wanted to throw her to the ground and tear off her clothes, and every time he was alone with this beautiful ing√©nue, his self-control took a tremendous beating.
 All that made him maintain it was the knowledge that her father would kill him if he laid a finger on her before marriage.
 He glanced at his watch; he'd get Marie home by midnight and then spend a couple of hours at Mae's establishment.
 "Now it is a perfect evening."
 Marie smiled.
 "Every night in Hollywood must be like this."
 He laughed.
 "What makes you think that?"

Famine remains a persistent threat precisely because the world no longer feels that threat to be severe.
 India‚Äôs last major famine occurred in Bengal in 1943 during World War II.
 Although the deficit in food production was only marginal that year, three million died for lack of strong administrative intervention to improve distribution.
 A marginal deficit could work havoc in the absence of an efficient and equitable public distribution network.
 While there is no scarcity of food in the world, there is also not a sufficiently organized effort to promote food security, precisely because the sense of urgency is lacking.
 Abundant opportunities exist to eradicate hunger, but in the absence of a catastrophic event, serious effort is lacking.
 Famine attracts media coverage, political and public attention, but chronic hunger does not.
 With global food surpluses accumulating, an organized effort can ensure food security for people everywhere.
 The challenge of achieving food security for all human beings is complex, for it depends on the interaction between multiple factors ‚Äì technological initiatives to produce sufficient food; economic initiatives to stimulate sufficient employment opportunities and increase purchasing power; political initiatives to maintain a peaceful and stable environment, undisturbed by war or social unrest that can interfere with food distribution; and administrative initiatives to provide for those who are unable to provide for themselves due to poverty or during times of emergency.
 Peace, democracy, employment and food security are mutually interdependent.

Even before I'd gotten old enough to attend Prom, I'd still invariably spent the day grouchy and depressed.
 Things only got worse as I'd aged, presumably because I wasn't really as indifferent as I liked to pretend, and I couldn't hide behind the excuse of being too young to be asked anymore.
 My pulse had already skyrocketed; I almost didn't hear what Rachel was saying over the pounding in my ears.
 "...of course it's still a little ways away, but a girl like Britney starts early so she gets as high up the social food chain as possible."
 Rachel's words calmed me a little at the same time they sparked confusion.
 I'd never heard her be quite so cynical.
 It was completely at odds with the innocent, accepting exterior she usually displayed.
 My surprise must have leaked through.
 Almost as soon the thought crossed my mind Rachel's demeanor crossed back from the older, jaded visage, to one that was more youthful, even embarrassed.
 "Sorry, I know she's your friend.

‚ÄúExcuse me.
 I didn‚Äôt mean to interrupt.‚Äù She seemed pleased she had.
 Chevelle‚Äôs hand dropped and I could see out of the corner of my eye his face was hard.
 Ruby continued, ‚ÄúSteed said you had a guest so I just used the back‚Ä¶‚Äù She trailed off when his stare didn‚Äôt soften, but she smiled.
 ‚ÄúYou know, you do have your own room.‚Äù He stiffened and stood, not at all amused by her implication.
 Ruby began gathering things as she spoke, pretending she hadn‚Äôt noticed his attitude.
 ‚ÄúSo how did it go?‚Äù He relaxed a little but his mood didn‚Äôt rise in the least.
 ‚ÄúWe shall see.‚Äù ‚ÄúIndeed,‚Äù she purred.
 ‚ÄúIndeed.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt look back at me as he left the room, simply directing Ruby to take me with her when she‚Äôd finished.
 She seemed more than happy to comply and I was in no doubt we would be training again.

My arm tingled as the blood returned to the limb, freed of his harsh grip.
 Yes, he hates me.
 I flexed my fist.
 ‚ÄúAh, she escaped,‚Äù Ruby purred.
 ‚ÄúAnd you didn‚Äôt trust me with her.‚Äù The formation broke as Steed came to stand beside me, the corner of his mouth tipping into a grin.
 I stared at the group.
 I had no idea who they were, but from the way they spoke it was apparently no secret I was Chevelle‚Äôs prisoner.
 Or his property.

Imagine Henry David Thoreau as a neurotic who returns to Walden Pond and finds psychosis awaiting him there.
 Still, we concluded that a poet of Kerouac's passion and skill, who could make a hangover feel romantic, would pull out of his tailspin and rise again.
 That fall, Eric and I read most every day, then sat in my backyard or on a beach or sea cliff and talked for hours at a spell.
 Also, we worked at odd jobs, sold some possessions, and saved most of whatever our moms gave us.
 We needed gas money, so we could chase visions of Kerouac and his Beat pals through the places they haunted at the west end of their cross-country odysseys.
 Twice that fall, the minute school let out on Friday, we sped north on Highway 101.
 From Morro Bay to Santa Cruz, we followed the coast and made camp for the night on a cliff between Hearst Castle and Big Sur.
 Saturday, midmorning, we landed in North Beach, San Francisco.
 As we passed strip joints whose signage featured females twice as buxom as Lil' Abner's Daisy Mae, doormen beckoned and dared us to enter, though we were four years underage.
 We stood gawking at the posters on jazz clubs.

She yanked two cloaks from the corner and tied them on, covering our heads, and led me to the wardrobe by her bed.
 I couldn‚Äôt imagine how we could get any more clothes on as she opened the door and started to throw them onto her bed.
 But she leaned out of the wardrobe door to whisper, ‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù She stepped into the cabinet, dragging me with her.
 We were standing outside the rear of her house.
 She slid the false wall back in place and grabbed my arm again, our heavy cloaks moving like shadows as we ran from the village.
 We didn‚Äôt go far before she stopped and jerked me into a squat beside her.
 There was movement a brief distance ahead, a rabbit weaving from the cover of one rock to the next.
 As I watched, a stick shot from the ground and speared the animal through the chest, killing it instantly.
 I gasped.
 Ruby giggled at me.

 Which, in the end, is the ultimate art.
 It‚Äôs a paradox, in a way, isn‚Äôt it?
 Ask Lorelei.
 LE:  	Art is good, simple, pure.
 Like Rain and Other Distractions.
 BG:  	Thank you, sweet.
 LE: 	That‚Äôs what you‚Äôve been saying.
 Some people listen.

I opened my mouth, maybe to laugh the comment off, or otherwise hedge my bets against the humiliation and inevitable mocking laughter.
 Whatever it was I'd intended on saying evaporated away the instant he reached out and slowly slid his finger down the side of my face.
 The tiny part of me that was still screaming none of this could be real was pulled along by the rest of me.
 I completely abandoned myself to the sensations created by his touch.
 My nerve endings didn't know whether to classify his finger as icy cold or scorching hot, but before I could recoil in pain the sensation gave way to a tingly warmth that sank down into my center, simultaneously tightening and relaxing parts I didn't even know I had.
 My pounding heart seemed loud enough to hear from across the street.
 I opened my eyes, afraid he could somehow hear the overworked muscle, already flushing red with embarrassment, only to find a gentle smile waiting for me.
 If there was any insincerity to the expression, I was utterly unable to detect it.
 I cleared my throat, seeking to avoid the awkwardness that always followed these kinds of moments, but Brandon effortlessly defused all of that by opening my door and helping me into the car.
 "I'm sorry I wasn't around yesterday.

Good-bye."
 She headed for the door.
 "Marie, you know that I don't approve of your going out alone."
 "Father," she sighed, turning to face him, "I'm 23 years old.
 That's certainly old enough to go into town alone."
 "Not for a decent young woman.
 Where's your mother?"
 "At a committee meeting."
 She actually would rather go shopping with her mother than alone.
 Her mother had wonderful taste but still never tried to talk her out of some of the more outlandish items she wanted to try.

Harruq remained silent as his brother scanned him, tightening bandages and cleaning some of the nastier cuts.
 His mind lingered on the fight that night, blocks he had missed, moves he made he shouldn‚Äôt have, and opportunities presented he had not taken advantage of.
 But mostly he thought of Aurelia, giggling as vines held him and she blasted his back with springs of water.
 He did not sleep well that night.
 It would be a long while before he did.

 The mood in Woodhaven grew somber as dark rumors spread.
 First came word that troops were on their way to enforce an edict evicting all elves from the city.
 The more this rumor spread, the more elves seemed to arrive.

My mouth opened to speak once more but I was suddenly swept up, off Steed‚Äôs lap and into Chevelle‚Äôs arms.
 I managed fear for half a second but then lost the feeling to dizziness, followed quickly by only dull numbness.
 Chevelle was laying me on my bed.
 ‚ÄúStay here.
 It will pass.‚Äù His words were gentle now, the anger gone.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I whispered.
 He didn‚Äôt respond.
 He leaned over me to straighten the bedding, his face close to mine.
 I stared at his mouth, wondering briefly what it might taste like.
 I felt a sharp pain and realized I was biting my lip.

It did seem like it wasn't quite as hot though.
 Maybe it was getting late enough in the year to bring the temperatures down slightly.
 It was too much to hope it would actually drop to the low seventies, even when December came around.
 I made it down the lane and then started worrying.
 It was like I couldn't win.
 If Britney drove all the way out here and I was already gone because I'd taken the bus, she was going to be really mad.
 On the other hand, if she didn't show, I had no other way to get to school, and Mom would freak out.
 Part of the reason she felt like she could be gone so much ever since the accident was the fact that I always did the responsible thing.
 If she started thinking I was cutting class, she was going be furious.
 It would be like I was behaving irresponsibly and taking away her ability to pursue her art, all at the same time.

She told everyone how her mother told her how ugly she was her whole life and told her she was worthless, how she attempted to numb the pain with the drugs she took.
 How she became addicted to the drugs, and prostituted herself to pay for her habit.
 She said that she took all the drugs she could because she knew she would never be alive to see her twenty-first birthday.
 She smiled and announced that she was now twenty-one.
 She thanked one staff member after another and one student after another, each for something specific they had contributed to her healing.
 She said she now felt worthwhile, beautiful and confident.
 She had learned how to manage the demons in her head.
 She was beautiful and it shocked me that she had ever considered anything else and to the point that she tried to destroy herself.
 I couldn‚Äôt help but compare her in my mind to Ashley.
 A young man was next.

We are going dancing, aren't we?"
 "If you like.
 But I'd still like you to have some dessert."
 He reached into his breast pocket.
 "Maybe a bite of yours."
 "No.
 This is all for you."
 He held the box out to her.
 Her heart began to race.
 So this was the night!

‚ÄúFar from it.‚Äù
 Aurelia crossed her legs, tossed back her hair, and then leaned her head on her hands as she stared into the fire.
 ‚ÄúI want you to listen to me, alright Harruq?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù
 He glanced down, uncomfortable and saddened that Aurelia refused to look him in the eye.
 ‚ÄúVelixar is not who you think he is.
 He isn‚Äôt _what_ you think he is.
 He tried to kill me, Harruq.
 He enjoyed every second we fought.
 I saw many of my friends die at his hand.

I grabbed my bow and shot him with an arrow before he his little legs could he him very far.
 He fell to the ground, the arrow sticking straight up at the sky.
 Now the forest was maniac free.
 I killed the others and looked up to find the thrashers dead too, probably courtesy of Seth.
 A few dwarfs were also lying dead in front of Emily.
 I walked back to my body and closed my eyes.
 When I reopened them, I stood, stretching my legs.
 The four of us headed back to the restaurant together, adrenaline still pumping through my veins.
 I told Emily and the boys about the freaky dwarves.
 ‚ÄúCrazy right?‚Äù I asked, running a hand through my hair.

 ‚ÄúNot stupid, either.

 Lie to me if you must, just don‚Äôt expect me to believe it.
 Forgive me for hoping you could trust me.‚Äù
 The vines released, freeing the half-orc who smacked against the ground.
 By the time he picked himself up, the vines had pulled into the dirt.
 ‚ÄúI have something new planned for tomorrow,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be late.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to pay for that,‚Äù he grumbled, rubbing his sore wrists after she was gone.

The way he‚Äôd reacted when Fannie had struck me, the caress against my cheek, those were not the actions of a council elder.
 As we sat so near, it was hard to believe the concern wasn‚Äôt real.
 His eyes burned with intensity; they seemed even darker now.
 Dark‚Ä¶ like mine.
 I looked away.
 Steed broke in through the trees, gesturing toward the direction he‚Äôd come from.
 ‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt far.
 Ready and able for a morning adventure.‚Äù As he approached, he glanced at me and then Chevelle, still close beside me.
 ‚ÄúWe can get an early start.‚Äù He lifted a pack from beside the fire and said, ‚ÄúBluebell?‚Äù I stood, following this stranger without question, not missing the irritation on Chevelle‚Äôs face.
 He unclasped the pack to roll the blankets out with a flip, smiling and nodding good evening before stepping away from my hastily constructed hut.

Wave after wave of arrows rained upon them, and those who fell were trampled by the rest, but the masses were not even slowed.
 Harruq pointed past the army to where a long line of men stood in the distance, carrying no light or torch.
 ‚ÄúWhat are they doing?‚Äù he asked.
 Qurrah searched the line, and he saw what he suspected.
 ‚ÄúThe necromancer,‚Äù he observed, pointing to the black shape hidden underneath robes and a hood.
 ‚ÄúThose alongside him are dead, Harruq.
 They serve only him.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúHuh,‚Äù Harruq said.

It is hard for me as they tell me their horrific stories of a life we once lived.
 They tell me it is great to talk to someone who understands what they are experiencing as a parent.
 Most have no one who can relate so they keep their family secret and they try to figure out what to do just as we did.
 I don‚Äôt judge them.
 My mother used to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll always love you, but sometimes I don‚Äôt like you.‚Äù I now know exactly what she meant, as I felt that often as a father.
 Otherwise why would I have done what I did, but for love?
 Brandon‚Äôs life was worth saving and as ill prepared as I was to help in many ways, I helped in the only way I could.
 Our son now works at Narconon full time.
 He shares an offsite mobile home with up to six roommates at a time.
 They have one bathroom but it doesn‚Äôt seem to bother him in the least.

I wasn't about to pry if there was something she didn't want to tell me.
 "I guess that's fair.
 Let me know if you have any more questions."
 Rachel nodded, and then turned back to her book, apparently having used up her store of courage for the afternoon.
 I stopped by Britney's desk to ask if she needed any help, and had to avoid an attempt to suck me into another gripe session about Mrs. Campbell.
 Satisfied that there wasn't anything I needed to be doing to help either of the other girls, and that they'd let me know if that changed, I broke out my Spanish book and reviewed some more vocabulary.
 Despite my growing hatred for Mrs. Tiggs, I managed to get deep enough into my Spanish homework to lose track of time.
 When I finally surfaced from abeja, camisa, and reloj it was just five minutes before I was supposed to close up for the afternoon.
 Rachel pulled her things together and left while I was straightening up the chairs.
 It was petty, but I waited inside the room until the clock showed exactly the time the lab was supposed to finish, and then joined Britney outside in the oppressive heat.

He looked like a god among men, and the way the soldiers fell at his feet made him think he might have been one.
 This red-dream self looked straight at him and spoke, but Harruq could not understand the words.
 The sound of his own voice chilled him, though, for it was dark, it was dangerous, and it was exactly like Velixar‚Äôs.
 _A god among men,_ said a second voice, one he had never heard before.
 It was darker than any shade that haunted his nightmares.
 There was only one it could be, and it was no mortal.
 _Protect your brother, and I will grant you a kingdom.
 Live as you have always lived, and I will reward you with eternity.
 Kill, as I desire you to kill, and you will find a peace unknown to the mortal realm.
 The time for questioning is over.

At least now I could listen to my music while I studied.
 Fifteen minutes later I was safely ensconced in my room listening to the London Cast version of Les Mis√©rables as I tried to work through my backlog of Algebra assignments.
 When I finally surfaced from orders of operation as the sun started setting, I was pleasantly surprised things had gone so well.
 As masochistic as it sounded, I actually enjoyed settling down with a set of academic problems, and working my way through them.
 Sometimes I entered a Zen-like state where everything else in the world just dropped away.
 It was nice to know the accident hadn't changed that at least.
 My heart stuttered a little, but I wrenched my thoughts away from where they'd been headed, distracting myself by wondering where Mom was.
 She'd been a little flighty before, but now it wasn't uncommon for her to be gone for twenty-four hours at a stretch.
 In some ways it was hard not having her around, but in other ways it was a relief.
 Sometimes she reminded me too much of Dad and Cindi.

I have never harmed you, never said a cursing word, but now this?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúJust a few questions and you may return to your slumber.‚Äù
 Qurrah paused, a smile growing across his lips.
 ‚ÄúTell me, did you ever sleep with an orcish woman?‚Äù
 The spirit recoiled as if struck.
 ‚ÄúYou dare ask me if I ever committed an act so disgraceful and‚Ä¶‚Äù
 ‚ÄúAnswer me!‚Äù
 The cry from Qurrah rolled over him like a horde of stampeding horses.
 All his resistance broke away, meaningless, preventing nothing.
 ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Ahrqur said.

What he must feel toward me for taking so much from him.
 My mind was reclassifying every look he‚Äôd ever given me, everything that had happened since I‚Äôd met him.
 Why he hadn‚Äôt looked at me as I‚Äôd lain under the tree in the meadow, explaining why Fannie had struck me.
 Why I‚Äôd wanted to learn transfer magic‚Ä¶ to get my mother‚Äôs things.
 The look he‚Äôd given the pendant on my neck‚Ä¶ my mother‚Äôs pendant.
 Of course he‚Äôd volunteered to be my watcher.
 I had taken everything from him.
 My thoughts began to muddle as my mother and my dreams and my own life twisted together.
 I still couldn‚Äôt retrieve my memories; I only had the last years, which seemed a haze now.
 The only parts clear to me were the days since Chevelle walked through Junnie‚Äôs door.

‚ÄúEspecially those things that are controlled.‚Äù
 An orb floated above his open palm, seemingly made of thick, violet smoke.
 Within its center, a face shifted, its sunken eyes glaring.
 When it opened its mouth, no sound came forth, just a soft puff of ash.
 ‚ÄúA soul seeking release,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúHow destructive, I wonder?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúGet rid of it,‚Äù Harruq said as he picked up the other sword the orc had dropped.
 ‚ÄúYou disagree?‚Äù Qurrah asked, his delight vanishing into a sudden frown.
 ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Harruq said.
 He thought to explain and then just shrugged.

 ‚ÄúMaster exhausted himself defending his tower,‚Äù Qurrah said, waving a dismissive hand.
 ‚ÄúHe collapsed at the very top.
 I cast a spell upon his throat, filling it with ice.
 I watched him die and then I left that disgusting place forever.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYou were a worthy apprentice,‚Äù Velixar said.

But our culture feeds the desire to own or consume until what we think we need makes us greedy.
 ‚ÄúThe Bible says that we should work so we‚Äôll have something to share with people in need.
 I can work for a few days a week and by not letting myself want a bunch of stuff, I can have money to give away.
 So I‚Äôm careful about what I buy, and I pick the things I do buy for durability and longevity.
 I need a car, so I buy a Toyota.
 If I needed a car that would break down, I could buy a Jaguar.
 ‚ÄúAnd it isn‚Äôt only the desire for stuff that devours our time.
 It‚Äôs also that we try to buy security.
 People think they need to not only have lots of stuff, but to save or invest or buy some insurance so they‚Äôll be sure they‚Äôll always have lots of stuff.
 We need a bit more faith.

Brandon's expression hardened, and I suddenly knew there was no going back.
 Maybe it would've been worth it to let him grope me a little, but done was done.
 People were starting to gather around us, Brandon's closest friends, the ones he ate lunch with every day, were all standing behind him, while everyone else filled out the circle.
 I looked around for some kind of support from the other girls present, but couldn't find even one sympathetic face.
 The next thing I knew I was on the ground with my ears ringing and Cassie standing over me.
 "...your stupid lies.
 If you repeat them you'll be sorry.
 Every single person here will vouch for Brandon."
 A couple of people flinched a little at that, like they weren't completely comfortable lying, but Cassie stared them down.
 Nobody would meet my gaze.

‚ÄúYou probably think I could keep Eric and Kenny in school, but here‚Äôs the way things are.
 Once the police get involved, the school board has to expel.
 That‚Äôs policy.
 Otherwise, they won‚Äôt usually expel, for fear a parent will sue them.
 ‚ÄúEric and Kenny are good boys, I know.
 If I can do anything for them, I will.
 Now, you two, please go learn something.‚Äù
 A Bigger Change
 Since Kenny‚Äôs dad was football coach across town at Coronado High School, Kenny transferred there and would graduate, and meanwhile bat leadoff on their baseball team.
 Eric became a lot boy at a Lemon Grove Ford, a ten minute walk from Sylvia‚Äôs house.

Now, the story that‚Äôs told is that I hated recording, that I was, I don‚Äôt know, juvenile, about doing numerous takes.
 I probably did say, ‚ÄúThat was good enough,‚Äù a couple times.
 But, man, Jim is such a gentle man, he just took it all in stride.
 He knew when it was done, man, when it was complete.
 If not for him, we never would have gotten ‚ÄúMr.
 Handy‚Äù down, I know.
 And he encouraged that drum solo, man, not like the myth that‚Äôs grown up around it, that we, what‚Äîperversely tried to kill the album‚Äôs potential.
 It was a time of excess, for one thing, and for another, man, listen to that cut.
 It smokes.
 It cooks like little else on vinyl at that time, except for maybe some Cream, some Who.

It took several seconds for my eyes to adjust, and then I started being able to pick out individual shapes in the darkness.
 Alec set me down as Vincent appeared, a towering, furred figure illuminated by the light of the flares that'd been planted on either side of the cleared space.
 His dark eyes drank in the light as he surveyed us with his typical boundless arrogance.
 A horde of shifting figures milled about just outside of the twin circles of light.
 The rest of Brandon's pack and they seemed to have grown in number since the dance.
 Jasmin and Dominic crowded up against me, one on either side, and I let my hands brush against their heads.
 The feel of their fur, one short and soft, the other long and coarse, anchored me before the surreal strangeness of the scene could carry me away.
 The tingle of shape shifter power was as strong as I'd ever felt it, jumping from multiple sources, arcing around me as it unsuccessfully looked for a place to ground out.
 For the first time, I was able to accurately pick out the individual signatures that made it up.
 Jess was off to the left, white hot with mixed anger and fear, stabilized only by the cool, controlled pillar of power that was Isaac.

I looked away before anyone could see me staring.
 Britney was still looking longingly at a pile of fries.
 When I looked up again Brandon was looking back at me with a smile that communicated all kinds of things I'd always thought you needed words for.
 His expression seemed to say he was glad to see me, embarrassed to be the center of attention, and sorry he couldn't get away from his friends to come over and say hi.
 I felt my face go hot with embarrassment.
 I tried to step behind a pillar before he saw me go bright red, but knew I hadn't succeeded.
 I bit my lip as I realized how spastic I was being.
 I'd spent the last sixteen-plus years suppressing my natural tendency to form crushes on one cute boy after another.
 I'd nearly perfected the art of exhibiting zero interest in the opposite sex.
 The whole point of my existence had been avoiding the kinds of things that'd result in everyone laughing at me.

 I mean, fuck, without me, he wanted to tour as Black Lung, play those old songs like they were his.
 I said, fuck you, man.

 And let me go on record right now as saying that he brought the lawyers in.
 I mean, he told me he was going on tour‚Äîtold me, not asked me, and I said, great, what are you gonna fucking play?
 You know?

Mallory started to answer, only to break off as she was overcome with another coughing fit.
 Thankfully this one was less intense.
 "Many of the gifts aren't flashy like Brandon's strength.
 In fact, I suspect that many of the Fir'shan actually develop gifts but never realize it because they're of a less powerful nature, and are mistaken for luck, or uncommonly sharp instincts.
 Your gift seems to be that of sharing dreams."
 I gasped as I realized what Alec must have suspected for quite some time.
 "You mean that was really him in my dreams?"
 "Indeed.
 That's part of why he was so concerned you might be a powerful Fir'shan posing as a normal human."
 A tiny sound just outside the door preempted my next question.

Even though I lived on my own, I was still a kid and I knew no better than to live like one.
 I found myself associated with a group at school referred to by some as ‚Äúhot-rodders‚Äù and by others as ‚Äúburnouts.‚Äù The hot-rodders loved and raced every kind of American muscle car you could imagine, and this was what drew me to them.
 As every school has its ‚Äújocks,‚Äù ‚Äúnerds,‚Äù ‚Äúburnouts,‚Äù and other cliques and the reps that go along with them, it is difficult for an impressionable adolescent to avoid.
 The hot-rodders had a ‚Äúbad boy‚Äù reputation affiliated with drug use.
 Many hot-rodders did drugs and many of us sold drugs (usually to the jocks).
 It was the days of cocaine and pot, and I saw and consumed my share of it.
 Thomas became one of the bigger drug dealers in town.
 His house was filled with booze and drugs of all types.
 Cocaine was the most popular, that, and pot; but magic mushrooms and acid were also available.
 It was the late seventies, after all.

The force smashed him into a decorative table.
 He rolled off the broken thing and glanced down at the blood soaking his robe.
 Despite the wound, no cut or hole was visible in the cloth.
 ‚ÄúYou are pathetic, Ahrqur,‚Äù Qurrah said, his hands whirling.
 ‚ÄúYou are skilled but you are soft.
 You lack spirit, will.
 It is why you cannot resist my power.
 _Hemorrhage!_ ‚Äù
 A visible wave of distorted reality crossed the distance between the necromancer and Ahrqur.
 The elf crossed his arms against the blow.

Put your sword down now!‚Äù demanded Audrian.
 Rodregas stepped forward and buried just the tip of his right-handed short sword into Audrian‚Äôs chest, hitting the ribs but not shoving the blade through.
 Audrian gasped in surprise and fell back.
 ‚ÄúSwear you will keep my secret and you live, do not and you die.
 Choose!‚Äù Audrian just stood there looking at him.
 Then he nodded and said, ‚ÄúIn the name of the All-Father, Lord of Sky and Earth and Water, I swear that I will keep your secrets.‚Äù Rodregas nodded and relaxed slightly; few would dare break a promise to the All-Father.
 Rodregas decided that Brit and Geor were like pale shadows as they quickly followed suit.
 When he turned to the last two he saw that they were very interested in what he was saying.
 ‚ÄúWhere do you go, Sir Paladin?‚Äù He showed no sense of humor at Rodregas‚Äô little joke about being a Paladin; Rodregas hoped Doi‚Äôvan had not taken him literally.
 ‚ÄúAs far as I can, is my main plan at the moment.

Developing the human resource should be the centrepiece of all development strategy.
 We can solve today‚Äôs most pressing problems if we adopt a total approach which takes into account all the interrelated factors ‚Äì political, economic, technological, social and environmental ‚Äì rather than relying on partial strategies.
 Partial remedies, however welcome or desirable, can always generate side-effects ‚Äì such as the increase in social tensions and violence observed when increasing political and social freedom are not matched by increasing economic opportunity, or the rise in unemployment and arms exports that accompany a reduction in defence expenditure.
 The success of the Green Revolution was due to its integration of technological, institutional, commercial and public policy measures, while its short comings arose from its failure to integrate environmental factors, which are now being incorporated in agricultural development strategies.
 Comprehensive measures can eliminate the side-effects of partial progress.
 The progress of the whole depends on the progress of all its parts.
 Humankind is infinitely enriched by the qualitative diversity of culture and individual expression, but it is immeasurably impoverished by the quantitative abyss which separates the more fortunate from the rest of humanity.
 The most prosperous levels of society cannot fully and finally rise to higher levels of accomplishment and enjoyment without first ensuring that the less fortunate and less productive are helped to obtain the full fruits of life at the present level of social achievement.
 Social equity, apart from its moral value, is an essential condition for continued progress.
 A proper balance has to be found between the principles of freedom and social responsibility, competition and co-operation, and between public good and private profit.

 But it was all so strange.

 She frowned for a minute, trying to see all this from his point of view.
 It must be as strange for him as it was for her--a woman from the past had walked into his garden.

There's a man named Stephen Hawking--" "He's a very well-known scientist."
 "Then maybe what this article says could be helpful.
 But I can't understand it.
 It has all these strange words--wormholes, white dwarfs, odd things like that.
 I can't follow this at all."
 "Let me see it then."
 He reached for it and then handed her a book in return.
 "This book is a little older than the others.
 It's probably easier to follow."
 As he read the article, he understood why she'd found it so difficult.

She didn't take her eyes off the screen, and because it was free of sexual innuendo, she understood most of the comedy.
 "That was wonderful," she sighed when the show was over.
 "Imagine--being able to see a picture in your own house whenever you want."
 "That's another thing we take for granted.
 Lots of times I have it on when I'm reading and don't pay any attention to it."
 "Why would you have it on if you're reading?"
 "Just for the sound.
 So I won't feel alone."
 "Oh.

"Yes, I understand.
 But--" "No.
 If I can't have Rick, I don't want anyone."
 She cried against her mother's shoulder until her tears were exhausted.
 Was Rick as miserable as she was, she wondered.
 Was he sorry he'd made it possible for her to go home?
 Was he wishing they'd made love?
 Did he sit for hours just as she did, paralyzed with misery and loneliness, constantly thinking about her as she was constantly thinking about him?
 "Why don't I get you some juice, darling?"
 "No, thank you."

 ‚ÄúWhat do you remember?‚Äù ‚ÄúI was‚Äî‚Äù I faltered.

 No, no, I wasn‚Äôt tied.

 I felt a light pressure on my forehead and my eyes flew open instinctively, though I‚Äôd had no response from them all the hours I‚Äôd struggled to force them open.
 It was Ruby.
 She sighed with relief.

Mrs. Campbell stopped by for a few minutes, obviously checking to make sure that I was over my aberrant behavior from yesterday.
 I got the feeling she would've liked to chat for a bit longer, but we had the predictable surge in attendance given the coming test.
 I gave her my best reassuring smile as she left, and then watched as she and the other tutors all bounced from one student to the next answering questions.
 As much as I would have liked to just call it a day, another good effort added to what I'd done earlier would put me two or maybe even three days ahead of my personal schedule.
 With a sigh of resignation I found my place on the page again, and started sorting out another set of variables.
 Forty-five minutes later I'd nearly completed another two sections, and was more than ready for a breather.
 Sometime while I'd been studying, most of the kids had left.
 I hadn't expected all of them to stay until my shift started, but I'd expected more than the two or three I usually had.
 Only it didn't look like that was going to be the case.
 Apparently most of them hadn't been serious about learning the material--they'd just wanted to come to the lab, make a half-hearted attempt, and then leave secure in the knowledge that if they failed the test they could whine to their parents about how hard they'd worked.

 Never mind.
 Like Richard Nixon, I was born in a house my father built, a basement he poured.
 A sandlot diamond behind the house where I got a splinter once in my rear.

 A street of gravel with ditches for drainage: Eighth Street.
 And a cocker spaniel bitch named Cyrano.
 Born with eyes the color of the sea, green and mud, a dull roiling behind a semitranslucent screen.
 Born in a matter of minutes, so fast the nurses were dubious, the doctor almost late.

My mother had killed his family, his entire clan.
 He‚Äôd been there in the village in my dreams, in my memories.
 He had saved me.
 His family was there as well.
 The people running and screaming and dying were his clan.

 They were Grand Council.
 The council was circling my mother to stop her.
 She was killing the northern clans.

It was all so crazy.
 Two weeks ago my life had revolved around my inability to think of certain things without collapsing.
 That hadn't changed, but now there was a distinct possibility Jasmin was going to hurt me just to ensure I stayed silent.
 Oh, and I was actually considering opening myself up for some very nasty ridicule, just on the infinitesimally slim chance a boy who was so popular, rich, and gorgeous that he shouldn't even know my name might be interested in me.
 Life was supposed to get better as you got older, but it was starting to look like it just got more complicated.
 Just before I looked back down at the shiny aluminum of my now-naked can, Brandon looked up and caught my eye.
 The smile on his face seemed to say all kinds of things.
 I'm sorry I can't come over and talk.
 They all really depend on me.
 This whole thing with Jasmin is really crazy; we've got to figure out how best to handle it.

But he understood that they were healthy enough to go.
 So he then asked the question that he really wanted to ask, ‚ÄúDo you know if Imeralda is coming with us, or if she staying with you?‚Äù He should have asked her that himself during the last few days.
 But he was afraid to ask the beautiful young woman.
 He was afraid of what the answer might be.
 ‚ÄúDo you truly understand Imeralda‚Äôs dual nature?‚Äù asked Jordaan.
 ‚ÄúShe is a half Nymph.
 What does that have to do with her going or staying?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúNothing, but it does if you love her.‚Äù Jordaan said with his big smile.
 His expression showed nothing but his normal cheer.
 Instead of answering the Nymph‚Äôs question Rodregas asked him one instead.

I wanted to stop.
 Each piece opened up another fragment of my soul, revealing a new pain that I'd kept hidden for the last few months.
 The last picture was next to a door, which I opened almost without realizing I was doing so.
 The organized confusion of a true artist met my gaze.
 I'd seen it with my mom, when she was so driven to complete a shot that she couldn't be bothered to clean up after herself.
 She left just enough structure to the mess to find needed tools, but didn't waste any effort on anything that wouldn't help her with her great aim.
 Brushes were scattered everywhere, old and new canvases stacked in the corners of the studio, and flecks of paint had found their way onto almost every visible surface.
 The rich smell of paint was nearly overpowering, but I noticed it only in passing as I made a beeline towards the easel that dominated the center of the space.
 The painting was still wet, right down to the signature which had been done in the palest green.
 The scene was from the point of view of someone looking into a bedroom window, darker than most of the later stuff I'd just looked at.

Somewhat dazed, she went to her room, only to find that she'd left her key in Rick's room.
 She returned, glancing up at him sheepishly when he opened the door for her.
 "I forgot my key."
 He retrieved it from the dresser and handed it to her.
 He kissed her lips lightly.
 "Goodnight, sweetheart."
 "Goodnight."
 She went back to her own room, wishing that she could sleep next to him all night.
 They drove down to Tijuana the next day, and Marie was delighted with all the shops and stalls and stands.
 People would wave things under her nose, and it was hard to say no.

I would've enjoyed English if not for the wildfire buzz created by my little scene with Alec outside of Biology.
 Mr. Whethers repeatedly asked various clumps of giggling and or staring girls to be quiet, but his efforts were largely wasted.
 As time went on the speculation grew both wilder and louder rather than petering out as any normal person would've expected.
 The former was probably due to an almost complete lack of anything resembling actual fact.
 The volume was no doubt designed to see if they could draw a reaction out of me and thereby figure out how I'd gone from dating one of the two most popular boys in school to dating the other one in the space of just one weekend.
 The prevailing opinion among the popular girls off to the left was that I was the biggest slut ever.
 The equally vindictive but more scholastically minded group in front of us was convinced I was just playing with Alec in an attempt to make Brandon jealous.
 It was all so far off that part of me wanted to laugh.
 I couldn't care less if Brandon was jealous, and Alec hadn't even kissed me yet.
 Even so, hearing my name said with such disdain by so many different people took its toll over the course of the class, and before long I was once again fighting the urge to break down and cry.

He scrutinized me, and I resisted the urge to straighten my hair and brush the dirt from my clothes.
 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be shy.‚Äù The stranger beckoned, gesturing to an upturned log beside the fire.
 The meat sizzled and popped as I crossed to him and sat obediently.
 It was too late to hide; I might as well at least have something decent to eat.
 Its smell was unfamiliar, but I didn‚Äôt care.
 It smelled like food.
 He reached down and tore a hunk from the spit, tossing it to me with a wink.
 When I blushed, he smiled a wicked smile.
 My mouth went dry.
 He was tall and broad with dark hair and eyes.

At least not with Davis, because she wasn‚Äôt going to marry him.
 So .
 .
 .
 Looking at Rick, she asked, ‚ÄúDo you still have the article?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah.
 Upstairs.‚Äù She followed him to his office, where he took the article out of a desk drawer.
 Without a word, he handed it to her.
 The picture was one she and her parents and John had posed for just days before her father had disinherited him.
 The article with it was short.
 It was strange to read about herself, although, as Rick had told her, it didn‚Äôt say much.

Harruq nodded, disturbed by the hungry look in Qurrah‚Äôs eyes.
 ‚ÄúI did,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand it scared the abyss out of me.‚Äù
 Qurrah dismissed this with a wave of his hand.
 ‚ÄúWith exposure comes understanding.
 I am always in control, so don‚Äôt fear what I do.
 But I must learn, Harruq.
 I have no school, no teacher, nothing but scattered memories of my wretched master when I was nine.
 Nevertheless, death‚Ä¶‚Äådeath has a way of teaching us things.
 I can sense its power so clearly in its presence.
 I need it.

BG: 	Well, so much of this shit they do now, man, you don‚Äôt even have to be in the same city.
 You gotta realize multi-tracking was relatively new, and, man we were babes in the wood, naives, we didn‚Äôt know how to play without someone playing with us.
 We started out on 4 tracks, remember that.
 So all this gimmickry, this Sgt.

I felt Cliff staring at me.
 He was in the back seat.
 When I glanced his way, he asked, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your head?‚Äù In truth my head felt enormous and heavy.
 Even my eyeballs ached.
 ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said.
 ‚ÄúBut check this out, everything looks weird.
 I mean, awfully weird.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow so?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, awfully bright, way more beautiful, only scarier.
 Something like that.‚Äù ‚ÄúProbably tequila,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù But it wasn‚Äôt.

Still I invited her to the prom.
 She accepted.
 Then a girl passed along a rumor that Liz Pence wanted to go out with me.
 Liz was a beauty.
 We dated a few times before the prom, and she would've preferred that I give Karen notice and take her instead.
 But I was neither that cold-blooded nor that stuck on Liz.
 She might be as pretty, but if she possessed any goodness like what I saw in Karen, she hid it deep.
 Prom night, for reasons more complicated than I can remember so long, Cliff was driving a '49 Ford convertible that belonged to Bob Williams, whom I will visit in Portland a few days from now.
 Cliff's date was Chris Latin.
 Karen and I rode in the back seat.

He did not sleep well that night.

 The mood in Woodhaven grew somber as dark rumors spread.
 First came word that troops were on their way to enforce an edict evicting all elves from the city.
 The more this rumor spread, the more elves seemed to arrive.
 Elven men and women with camouflage and great longbows patrolled the city.
 Even more lingered in taverns and the homes of kin.
 Many humans left for the homes of family and friends, wanting no part of the coming conflict, while others spent hours whispering with the elf men in the bars.

Running Dog, Peabody and Sherman‚Äîthat‚Äôs a funny story, really.
 They started at Peabody School, so that‚Äôs where the Peabody comes in, and the lead singer‚Äôs name was really Sherman.
 When they opened for us‚ÄîI remember it was really fucking hot that night, one of those Memphis nights where the humidity feels like urine in the air‚Äîand they were talking to us backstage.
 And I said, I like your name‚ÄîI‚Äôm a big Bulwinkle fan.
 They had no fucking idea what I was talking about.
 (laughs)  They really named themselves that with no knowledge of the cartoon at all.
 LE: 	Lovelights.
 BG:  	They sucked.
 Just some guys with cheap instruments doing jams because they didn‚Äôt really know how to play, you know, so they thought it was avant garde or something to do these instrumentals, like it was jazz.
 Horrible.

‚ÄúAre you here for money?
 I could pay you twice the pittance you work for.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúJust shut up,‚Äù Harruq said, hurling Salvation across the room.
 Ahrqur leapt again.
 The sword punched through the couch and embedded in the wall.
 The half- orc gripped Condemnation in both hands, snarling as the elf launched his own offensive series.
 The elven blade glided through the air, repeatedly feinting and looping wide so that Harruq‚Äôs sword danced about for phantom blows.
 Ahrqur let out a mocking laugh, gave him an obvious feint, and then kicked high.
 The foot smashed the bottom of Harruq‚Äôs chin, the same sore part Dieredon had hit.
 Harruq staggered back, his sword swinging wildly.

‚ÄúYou, my fine Van‚Äôdret, are more in the world than most of us.
 You are out traveling and adventuring, while most of us Immortalist just sit in our towers.
 I have always thought that our one weakness was our isolation.
 It is hard to know what is exactly happening when we are not out to see it.‚Äù  For a moment, Taiga paused, looking up at the crystal roof overhead in apparent contemplation of the possible implications of their isolated natures.
 After a moment, in which Van‚Äôdret waited patiently, Taiga continued, ‚ÄúYou are one of our best, and yet you are also in the world.
 The tournament draws the powerful and those who wish to be powerful.
 I would simply suggest that you keep your eyes open, and keep your  mind a little more focused both on your journey and at the Cathedral,‚Äù Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs tone almost dismissed his own comment as a simple chatter of no import.
 Accept Van‚Äôdret had been invited to have lunch with one of the most powerful people on the planet to drop the simply suggestion that he should keep his eyes open for something unusual at the Cathedral of the Heavens.
 The rest of the dinner quickly wrapped up, and Van‚Äôdret soon found himself caught up in thought as he journeyed down several floors to the Great Hall that served as the gathering place for the other Immortalist in residence in the city.
 His questing mind was rudely interrupted by a woman stepping to his side and asking him, ‚Äúso did you ask him?‚Äù ‚ÄúAsk him what?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret asked.

They are powerful fighters, but also lead packs of daemons in combat and have powerful magical abilities.
 Most of these others are powerful and dangerous, but a Bunei is more than a simple fighter of the Infernals.
 I am actually surprised to see they‚Äôre with the other beasts.
 I thought them a type of Greater Daemon.
 I think I might see what happens when I touch it,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan said.
 ‚ÄúIs that wise?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 He was not challenging him.
 Doi‚Äôvan was clearly asking himself the same thing.
 He looked over at Rodregas and shrugged.
 ‚ÄúWe both have the power of the Infernal Realm in us.

 Unrecorded, but always in our sets back then.

 I‚Äôll have to think about it.
 And it was during my sophomore year that I met Tennessee Larry Dorich.

"Alec, no."
 "It wasn't that expensive and you've already told me I could."
 "I didn't think you'd have something already ready and waiting to ambush me with.
 I thought I'd at least have a few days to prepare myself."
 He smiled again and I gingerly held my hand out.
 The green velvet lid swung up to reveal the most delicate necklace I'd ever seen.
 It was a thin glass heart set inside a slightly larger heart.
 "I saw it when I was in Virginia last week for business and thought of you."
 "It's beautiful.
 You shouldn't have, but thank you."

 ‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúYou know that this means that Kojas was here, so he can‚Äôt be too far away.‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get your hopes up.
 I saw him once and I have no intention of being near him anytime soon.‚Äù He sat on the edge, the wind tossing around his hair.
 It was going to be seriously wind-blown later.
 I sat down next to him and I was trying to forget the dwarf‚Äôs mangled body.
 I shook and hugged myself.
 ‚ÄúAre you cold?‚Äù he asked, his voice full of concern.
 I just shrugged and squeezed my eyes shut.
 I saw Kojas‚Äô glowing eyes and sword, the dwarf, his armies, the ghost girl, the dark woods and her haunting voice.

I call her on her cell phone and to my surprise she answers, she is frantic.
 She quickly states that they left, the deal is off and they are headed home.
 Her voice echoes as if she is in a closet.
 I know she hasn‚Äôt left because I just saw her run to the back of a Starbucks that I know well.
 She is nearly in tears and suddenly hangs up.
 I call the officer from my blue-tooth not knowing what is happening or what to do.
 I know they can hear me through the wire but I cannot hear them.
 Officer White tells me they have the male in custody as he was hiding the car in the apartment complex and he ran right into all of the marked police cars and attempted to run.
 The cops blocked him off with some unmarked cars that had been on him since his Dodge had slowed next to my truck.
 He tells me they are looking for the girl and ask me if I know anything about her whereabouts.

The blade was in one hand, the decorative scabbard in the other.
 ‚ÄúHe was a skilled swordsman,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúHe was also arrogant.
 I would expect such a blade from one like him.‚Äù
 Harruq shrugged.
 ‚ÄúIf I didn‚Äôt have my own two swords, I‚Äôd use it.‚Äù
 The half-orc cut the blade through the air a few times and then sheathed it.
 He turned the weapon over in his hands, marveling at the swimming colors of dark green and black.
 He paused when he found a name written in gold near the hilt.
 ‚ÄúTun‚Äôdel,‚Äù Harruq read aloud, slowly and carefully.

Is this our destination?
 My gaze shot up to find the village, and then I hastily clicked my heels when I realized I was being left behind.
 As we advanced, I could see movement amongst the elves.
 There was much activity, but it was nothing like home.
 No flags of quilts and rugs blowing in the breeze, no bright sunlight on a rainbow of colors, no dancing in the village center.
 A raucous sound traveled up to us and Chevelle waved a hand, his magic bringing the hood of my cloak up to cover my head and then his own.
 At once, my stomach was a knot again.
 We rode into town at a walk; Chevelle was sitting straight and tall in his saddle but his arm hung casually, hand resting on his leg.
 I was more comfortable watching him, looking for a reaction, than the passing elves.
 Two men walked by in the opposite direction, their dark eyes on us.

"It was incredible!
 I can't believe I danced with him!"
 "Come sit down for a minute and have a Coke."
 He managed to keep her still for less than five minutes.
 They danced almost non-stop for the next hour and a half, and then Rick declared he'd fall asleep behind the wheel if they didn't leave.
 Marie could have gone on, but about five minutes after getting in the car, she was yawning.
 Rick opened her hotel room door for her and gave her the key.
 "I'm not going to have them wake us up.
 Just come knock on my door whenever you get up."
 "OK."  She smiled up at him dreamily.

Now, on that very same spot, he would rescind that agreement.
 Beyond the clearing loomed several palisades.
 All nearby windows were closed, and several boarded.
 A few humans stuck their heads out their doors to glimpse the armored men trampling through their city.
 Most kept themselves far from danger.
 ‚ÄúElves and men of the city of Woodhaven,‚Äù Antonil shouted.
 ‚ÄúBy order of the noble and sovereign King of Neldar, all elven kind has been banned from human lands.
 The elves of Woodhaven have ignored this edict, ignored the laws of the great kingdom in which they live.
 This will not be tolerated any longer.
 All elves must leave the city, which being outside the forest of Erze, falls inside our borders.

By the time Mrs. Sorenson had fired a couple of ridiculously obscure questions at me, I found the good feelings I'd managed to carry away from the mayor's visit the night before had pretty much evaporated.
 English should have been better.
 Wuthering Heights wasn't ever going to be my favorite book, but Mr. Whethers had made the characters more real in the last few days and I was actually excited to see what he had in store next.
 Unfortunately, Mr. Whethers wasn't there.
 The substitute teacher sitting at his desk didn't even take roll; he just shut the door, told us to keep it down, and flipped open a magazine.
 While I was sitting at my desk wondering what to do with the next hour of my life, something I'd read in the physics book suddenly clicked.
 In a perfect world I would've been left in peace to finish reasoning out the answer.
 Instead, Britney leaned over and smiled.
 "So I was really surprised to see you with Brandon.
 I thought for sure he'd be pissed after you made Cassie back down like that."

Now go, we have stuff to do.‚Äù My stomach knotted.
 Stuff.
 Chevelle appeared reluctant to get up.
 For a moment, I thought he might reach out to me, but he only stood and left without another word.
 It ached.
 I didn‚Äôt want him to hate me.
 Ruby whirled into the room and grabbed me around the waist from behind, spinning me up, over the back of the seat, and through her door before I could process what was happening.
 She plopped me down in the center of her bed and swung around to sit in front of me.
 My head was reeling from the spin as she smiled at me, waving her hands and bringing a plethora of bottles and canisters flying toward us to drop on the bed.
 I thought with disappointment that I hadn‚Äôt responded to her attack as Chevelle had taught me and laughed at the image in my head.

"It was all just a game for you, wasn't it?"
 There was anger behind the voice now, subtle, like the scent of rain the night before a storm, but definitely there.
 I started to bristle; I even took a breath to explain what'd really happened.
 Only the truth wasn't any better than the story he'd fabricated.
 It was worse even.
 I'd much rather this cocky, spoiled, rich boy be mad at me than feel pity.
 I'd had enough pity from my mom to last years.
 "You bet.
 Think they bought it?"
 I tried to inject the proper amount of blonde stupidity into my words, but wasn't sure it worked until I felt Alec's arms tighten almost painfully around me.

 Happily, this night proved to be more restful and peaceful then the last.
 CHAPTER 5 A PLACE OF PRIDE
 Rodregas drove the wagon with Imeralda sitting next to him; Doi‚Äôvan continued his impressive show of endurance by actually jogging next to the wagon and showing no trouble keeping up.
 As the trail was more of a hunting path than a proper road and they were traveling on an upward incline, the wagon was struggling to make much time.
 It was not until their midday stop that the three had any real conversation.
 ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù asked Imeralda, ‚Äúwhere are we going?
 I assume it is not the Northern Kingdoms as you said to Audrian.
 For one thing that would be stupid, and for a second you seem to be climbing ever higher into the Arida Mountains and that is hardly the best way north.‚Äù Rodregas nodded.

I would call the target soon and instruct her to meet me in a particular spot.
 Things moved rapidly now and the instructions came quickly.
 I was instructed to get as much incriminating conversation as I could, including the price, quantity and name of the drug; anything beyond that would be helpful but gravy.
 The main thing was to get the money for the drugs.
 Then I was shown the contents of a small white plastic bottle: One hundred Oxys poured into the officer‚Äôs hand.
 They were smaller than I thought they would be and an odd green color.
 He gathered the pills back into the bottle and handed them to me, telling me to put them in an easily accessible jacket pocket.
 The officers were all gathered around, but my focus was now entirely on the lead man, Officer White, the same undercover officer who had busted my son, had screwed up by giving Brandon the wrong phone number and with whom I had negotiated this deal.
 He was cocky and his ego always front and center, but I completely understood this demeanor.
 A person who does this for a living should have a high level of confidence, and that translates into what one might call ‚Äúa strong personality.‚Äù I was listening as if my life depended on these men.

We were an oddity in the sixties to almost everyone we met.
 Other parents would question us when we visited our friend‚Äôs homes, extracting information that we were ignorant enough to share and which likely hit the gossip circuit immediately.
 The other mothers were threatened by our mother, as she was beautiful and divorced!
 I would later realize how poorly my mother was treated by other mothers, and how she endured many unwanted sexual advances and groping by their spouses and her employers.
 It was the sixties, and my mother was damaged goods in their eyes; she was vulnerable.
 We eventually moved out of my grandparents‚Äô home to an apartment in Los Angeles and then to a small rental house in Burbank that backed up to a military plant.
 Barrels of who-knows-what lined the side of our back fence.
 I guess the rent is cheaper when you live next to a toxic dump!
 We had a yard for our dogs and new friends to meet and we settled into this little house.
 My brother and I still shared a room, as we always had, and we still had each other despite another change in schools and friends.

It wouldn't be easy, but she did want to go to the shore.
 Bravely she returned to the dressing room, took off her clothes and her binding, and put on the black bathing suit.
 It fit .
 .
 .
 she thought.
 It was tight but not uncomfortably so, and it was pretty.
 But she blushed at her profile.
 She filled the front of the bathing suit, and the curve of her hips was all too apparent.
 To her eyes, she looked bulky.

 ‚ÄúAurry, are you there?‚Äù he shouted.
 He had hoped the elf would be waiting for him, but as he neared their usual clearing there was no sign of her.
 His heart skipped, and he feared she had already gone off to prepare for battle.
 ‚ÄúAurelia, come on out now,‚Äù he shouted again.
 His eyes searched the forest.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here,‚Äù Aurelia said.
 Her voice was quiet, subdued.
 Harruq turned and tried to smile.
 ‚ÄúThere you are.

The thought of never going home, of never seeing her parents or brother or Tom-- A sob caught in her throat, and she squeezed her eyes shut.
 She wanted to go home, but when she left Rick, her heart would break.
 Would she be trading one misery for another?
 CHAPTER TEN
 Marie dressed slowly the next morning.
 She hadn't felt such an ambivalence about her walk since .
 .

 since the morning they'd left for Hollywood.
 Had that been only nine days ago?

The door had a strange mechanism such as Rodregas had never seen before.
 Gorin lifted a large handle and solid squares of iron slid out of the floor and the ceiling.
 When both the top and the bottom fully released the guard pushed the doors wide.
 The three immediately pushed through and Rodregas said, ‚ÄúYou can close the doors.
 I will pound on them when we are ready to leave.‚Äù And with a nervous nod the doors slid closed behind them.
 As the door closed Gorin hastily added, ‚ÄúRemember not to touch anything until the Grand Marshal is present.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan nodded at the now closed doors and raised his torch.
 The three gazed around the room in wonderment.
 In response to the torch the room seemed to respond with a vague light of its own, which came from all directions.
 The chamber was large with a tall vaulted ceiling like some temple, but no rows of seats or prayer mats did this temple hold.
 Instead it was filled with beasts; lions and wolves and the great mythical animals of the Celestial Realm.

The courageous pioneer and talented individual who achieve more for themselves always draw upon a rich social legacy and build on the ideas, knowledge, discoveries, inventions and innovations of countless people and societies who have come before.
 Policies should be formulated to reflect the contribution of the collective to all individual achievement.
 The main prerequisite and condition for the fulfilment of the world‚Äôs many different potentials is peace.
 As democracy supports peaceful relations between states, economic prosperity and fuller development of people, peace makes possible the development of stable political institutions, more productive economic activity and a more civilized and enlightened social life.
 Without establishing a stable climate of peace, human rights cannot be safeguarded, democratic institutions cannot function effectively, prosperity cannot flourish, and human beings cannot discover their higher capacities for external achievement and inner fulfilment.
 Peace is imperative for a thriving democracy.
 A comprehensive perspective and integrated approach to these inter-related issues can lead to a major breakthrough on multiple fronts.
 We are poised at what can become a turning point in the role of war in human affairs.
 The momentous consequences at stake call for decisive action.
 Historically, war has been a means of territorial expansion and economic conquest that strengthened and enriched the conqueror while draining the energy and diminishing the wealth of the conquered.

They phoned at all hours, even risking Sylvia‚Äôs wrath, and they tailed him through the halls of our school.
 But if he had even kissed one of them, he kept it secret.
 A favorite of his, along with Margaret and Pam, was Carol, who had been his companion at Carmen Ranch club until their mystery afternoon together.
 Whatever happened might've tainted but didn't entirely spoil the pleasure they took in each other‚Äôs company.
 At school, Eric ran around with Laura Steinhoff, a freckled girl with a ready smile, who would someday be my wife and the mother of my first two astonishing kids.
 In place of his study hall, Eric worked as an office monitor, picking up attendance sheets and delivering hall passes.
 Laura was the other first-period office monitor.
 They skipped down the halls, holding hands and laughing.
 Laura held classroom doors open.
 Eric swooped in with his arms extended like wings, softly humming the Hallelujah chorus from Handel‚Äôs Messiah.

I still see incredibly well, and there's just the slightest hint of light from living things, but nothing like what you saw in the dreams."
 "So you work from memory mostly then?
 That and trying to make what you see when you're in human form even more drab than what you really see?"
 "That about sums it up, although I didn't really expect you to pick up on that last part so quickly.
 You're remarkably perceptive."
 I felt my face heat at the compliment.
 I quickly looked for something worthy of a chuckle to change the subject.
 "So what does a seventeen-year-old shape shifter spend his time doing?"
 I succeeded with my goal of making him laugh.
 "Well, I spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to keep my friends away from each other's throats.

 No, being torn.

 She would drug me.
 I didn‚Äôt want that.
 I didn‚Äôt want that ever again.

Faced with the abundance of evidence and the thought of five years in prison, Brandon broke and agreed to bust a dealer named Steve.
 The interesting thing about Steve was that much of the information the officers had on Brandon was from Steve.
 It‚Äôs quite a tangled web.
 Steve had been busted some time ago and released when he agreed to work with the narcotics division of the police department.
 Steve‚Äôs bust was kept a secret so he could fold back into the drug world unnoticed and collect information on drug dealers like my son and share that information with the officers so they could set up these dealers.
 Steve was tasked with introducing undercover officers into the inner circle that would eventually lead to a bust that appeared to be far removed from the original contact with Steve.
 The only problem with Steve is that he was double-crossing the narcotics officers and they had come to discover his deception.
 Steve and his girlfriend, Ashley were highly addicted to Oxy and their combined drug habit made it necessary for him to continue to deal Oxy to the bigger buyers while tossing a few small fish to the officers to appease them and satisfy his deal.
 The officers knew too that Steve was beating his girlfriend and forcing her to perform ‚Äúhappy ending massages‚Äù and sexual favors to support her personal addiction to Oxy.
 Brandon was one of the small fish that Steve provided information on.

He watched for a moment, suddenly nervous and quiet.
 The words of his brother echoed in his head.
 ‚ÄúAurry?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúYou said most elves remember when men were created‚Ä¶‚Äådo you know how orcs were made?‚Äù
 The elf looked at him.
 She was trying to read him, Harruq could tell, but he endured it without protest.
 ‚ÄúWhen Ashhur and Karak warred, there were elves that sought to end it,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúAgainst Celestia‚Äôs orders, they joined Karak, hoping their aid would finally end the conflict.
 When our goddess imprisoned the two gods, she cursed those elves.
 She stripped them of their beauty, their intelligence, and their long life.

Only a scattered few wore armor.
 Still, they stood in the straight lines of a disciplined army.
 A roar from Harruq at their heels spurred them on.

 ‚ÄúPlease, my daughter is still there.
 They might hurt her.
 Please, help us!‚Äù

After admiring it in the mirror for a moment, she reached for the smaller pair of trousers.
 The material felt comfortable, but they were so tight!
 Were they supposed to be this tight?
 Rick would know.
 She felt queer walking out in these clothes, but after having seen how women of this decade dressed, she knew she'd draw more attention in her Egyptian-motif dress than in this outfit.
 "Rick," she said, drawing his attention away from the people browsing in the store, "is this what they're supposed to look like?"
 His eyes grew big as he stared at her.
 The jeans revealed slender thighs, smoothly rounded hips, and, as she turned just a bit, a perfectly shaped little derriere.
 He started to reply to her question but found he had to clear his throat before he could speak.
 "You look great."

Blood oozed from between his clenched fingers and ran down his chest when he sat up.
 My wife was hysterical and rightfully so.
 I stood there numb, wondering what I had done and how did my efforts to be the best father I could be turn into this?
 I‚Äôd hit him‚Äîonce.
 But I intended to never hit my child.
 I had promised myself I would never, ever repeat this offense I had endured as a child.
 I just wanted to slap him out of it, to hurt him as we were hurting, because he seemed oblivious to the magnitude of our pain.
 It all happened so fast and when I realized that Brandon was bringing these drugs into our house, while we thought we were detoxing him, it was beyond me.
 I felt violated in so many ways, all at once and I snapped.
 Brandon‚Äôs nose was broken and my wife and sister-in-law attended to him to stop the bleeding and I sat in silent shock with Harry and Bryce flanking me on the couch‚Äî possible guards‚Äô against any further explosion into violence.

He wanted to pull away, but did not let himself.
 He had initiated the intimacy, and it would not be fair of him to pull away because of his personal doubts.
 ‚ÄúEasy,‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚ÄúI want to go nice and slow and enjoy every step.‚Äù They kissed again, this time eagerly exploring each other‚Äôs mouth and lips.
 He ran his lips down the line of her chin.
 Though he was trying to go slowly, they quickly found themselves naked.
 He thought if he had let her, she would have jumped right on him and slid himself inside her.
 Rodregas knew that Nymphs were legendary for their enjoyment of sex, but he was a little surprised at her eagerness.
 She ran her hands and lips across his chest, seemingly fascinated by ‚Äòhis‚Äô powerful musculature and smooth skin.
 Once again Rodregas found himself pulling away from her touch.
 He had never really had a woman that eager to touch him before.

"I wanted to apologize for what happened earlier today.
 Cassie can be a real jerk sometimes."
 It was too good to be true.
 I almost looked over at him, but I knew I'd lose myself in a pair of soft, gray eyes.
 Brandon seemed to understand that my silence meant I wasn't convinced.
 "You wouldn't believe how relieved I was when you stepped forward and stopped her before things got out of hand."
 My natural pessimism reasserted itself, undaunted by the fact that I could just see Brandon's exquisitely-muscled arm out of the corner of my eye.
 "If you knew Cassie was in the wrong, why didn't you stop her?
 She's your friend; you should have been able to defuse the situation before it got that far."
 Brandon took a deep breath.

And there were so many children!
 They were loud and ran round the camp all afternoon.
 And they were just as varied as the adults.
 I examined their wide noses, rounded ears, and stubby fingers.
 Those who wore no shoes had short, thick toes like trolls.
 The men had patches of hair curled on their chests and forearms and some even grew it around their chins like goats.
 Their clothes were tattered and ill-fitting rags.
 They moved about the camp slowly.
 Clearly they had no magic, and they definitely were the owners of the crude tools we had found.
 They spoke to each other often, their voices like the protest of an old hound.

At this rate, I‚Äôd be fawning and flipping my hair like Evelyn by sundown.
 When I finally walked into the library, I remembered why I didn‚Äôt go there to study lineages.
 There must have been a thousand volumes and tenfold more scrolls in the main level alone.
 And I had no magic to lead me in the right direction.
 I went to the section which would most likely house the desired information, and then closed my eyes and concentrated.
 Maybe it wouldn‚Äôt work, but I could try.
 I wasn‚Äôt sure I felt anything, but after a few minutes I imagined my right hand might have tingled a little.
 I grabbed a close volume and leafed through it.
 It was a legacy of the Viridian Forest clan.
 I pulled another volume down.

The girls are likely to start out with Broken, while guys are likely to pick up Torn and enjoy the extra action there.
 Either way, my biggest hope would be that the guys can introduce their wives and girlfriends to Broken, and the girls can introduce their husbands and boyfriends to Torn.
 We've included excerpts for both Torn and Splintered (the sequel for Broken and Torn) below.
 Acknowledgments: A big thanks to all of the fans who are doing so much to help get the word out.
 There are tons of you that I don't know, but I do want to make special mention of a few dependable souls that I'm very grateful to know, and who've helped in various ways with Torn, and who I suspect will continue to go above and beyond with Broken.
 Cassy & Mark, I'm glad you both turned out to be story addicts just like me.
 Thanks for everything.
 Dad, not everyone gets to be best friends with their parents.
 Thanks for all of the feedback and the ongoing support.
 Mimi, thanks for sticking with me long enough to get addicted and to fix some of my biology facts along the way.

"I'll rub some on your back."
 "Oh."
 She hadn't even thought about that.
 He rubbed lotion into her smooth, flawless skin.
 She was so small that when he used both hands, they almost completely covered her back.
 He liked touching her, and he spent so much time rubbing her back that he was afraid she was growing suspicious.
 But she hadn't uttered a single word.
 Dropping a light kiss on her shoulder, he moved away.
 Marie felt drowsy with pleasure and wished he hadn't stopped.
 But as he stretched out beside her, she realized how very much she wanted to return the favor.

More like wacky.
 Still, if don't write and share these loco thoughts of mine, not as many people will get to know about Eric, and Olga.
 No doubt Don will read my vision of Eric‚Äôs death as sacrifice and consider it a symptom of a narcissistic belief that the world revolves around me.
 The problem I find with such an explanation is, it wouldn‚Äôt answer a single question about why Eric knew all he did.
 So I‚Äôll risk having friends like Don intervene to get me committed.
 Because, even if I only saw a long shot chance that Eric died to rescue me, from death, from perdition, from a wasted life, or from a danger I can‚Äôt imagine, consider what a cold-blooded wretch I would have to be if I failed to give him his due.
 And Olga was so beautiful, I won't allow her to be forgotten.
 My Girl
 At home after the trip‚Äôs longest drive, the whole length of California including the purgatorial L.A. freeways, when Zo√´‚Äôs grandma leaves I think about waking my girl.
 She has only been asleep a half-hour.

No, I had a feeling he‚Äôd not be using one of our group.
 I was starting to get sleepy, but didn‚Äôt want to put the book down.
 This one worked.
 Dree‚Äôs nose bled for the first few minutes but after that she slept soundly and woke just before noon not knowing she had missed anything.
 Tomorrow, I try it on my watcher.
 Watcher.
 I fell asleep with her words in my thoughts.
 My imagination had filled in all the blanks, let the fear I‚Äôd been suppressing creep in, take over.
 It turned her words into my nightmares.
 Watchers and trackers, tassels and robes, Chevelle‚Äôs furious gaze as he pushed me from the cliff again.

 Do not accuse me of having a lying tongue.
 The truth is always enough, even for those who walk in the darkness.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúForgive me, master,‚Äù Qurrah said, bowing.

Sure, Franz Kafka was an office worker and William Blake a printer, but Kafka didn‚Äôt live very long and Blake had no kids.
 Anyway, those guys were geniuses.
 Not me.
 So I worried, would the baby help squash my writer‚Äôs dreams.
 People heard I was going to be a father again and asked, "So how old will you be when the baby turns eighteen?"
 or "What if you die?"
 She‚Äôs a girl, the doctor said, and I reasoned a girl might be quieter, a little more gentle than a boy.
 Knowing her sex made her more real.
 For the first time, I started getting pictures.
 I saw her as thin, pale skinned and strong like her mom, with reddish hair of a peculiar henna-like tint.

We pooled our money, bought an old Chevy, and pulled on to Highway 80.
 By New Orleans, we were low on money, and after one night in that town where we eighteen-year-olds could legally drink, we were broke.
 We slept in our car near a park on the far side of a rundown neighborhood from the French Quarter.
 For food and spending money, we foraged for soda bottles and redeemed them.
 With my share, I bought just enough beer so the proprietor of a smaller Bourbon Street bar allowed me to remain on a stool from which I admired a certain barmaid.
 She reminded me of Karen Flagstad.
 Not in her looks.
 She was taller and red haired.
 But in her expression, I read the same message I got from Karen‚Äôs sweet face.
 It said, I‚Äôve been hurt bad and know how it feels so I‚Äôll be nice to everybody and try not to make anybody else feel that way.

‚ÄúToday,‚Äù he yelled out, ‚Äúwe have a match of men and women who are ready to become knights, to be the very Champions of the Gods on this world.
 They are all worthy, but there can be only one new knight this day.‚Äù Faurrenida looked around slowly catching each of them by the eye.
 Rodregas was caught up in the commanding presence of the man.
 ‚ÄúTo the Order and to the Celestials!‚Äù his voice was half command and half prayer.
 Everyone including combatants and those watching from wall and window responded, so that the words swirled around the arena.
 ‚ÄúTo the Order and to the Celestials!‚Äù This time the Grand Marshal seemed to look around at all the spectators until finally he nodded, satisfied.
 Without another word he strode out.
 Imeralda followed him as did all the squire‚Äôs attendants.
 It was time for the final match.
 Rodregas left his shield and mace relaxed at his side and strode over to Nordien, who stood with shield and mace at the ready.

The schools can demonstrate the economic benefits of new and improved crops and cultivation practices, engaging local farmers as both students and staff, and covering most of the cost of training in the form of sale proceeds from the farm schools' production.
 7.Water conservation.
 The inefficient and negligent use of water in agriculture is one of the most serious barriers to a sustainable expansion of agricultural production.
 Public policy regarding the cost of water supplied by major irrigation projects and low-cost or free distribution of power for pumping underground water aggravate the problem.
 Technologically, the solutions to water depletion are largely in hand.
 What is needed is a massive effort in public education and demonstration, coupled with incentives to encourage their adoption.
 In monsoon regions it has been demonstrated that recharging underground aquifers by reverse pumping during rain-surplus seasons can restore ten years of water depletion in one rainy season.
 Proven methods are available and have been commercially applied with great success, as the achievements of Israel so dramatically demonstrate, radically to reduce water consumption by as much as five- to ten-fold, while at the same time significantly increasing crop yields.
 The most productive of these methods, involving the construction of greenhouses, is too capital-intensive for immediate wide spread adoption in developing countries.
 Drip and sprinkler irrigation are far more moderate in cost and still result in enormous savings of water.

 He grabbed Qurrah‚Äôs arm and hooked his elbow around it.
 Qurrah was too weak to complain, so together they ran down the streets.
 They passed closed homes containing people praying for safety and victory.
 Looming ahead of them was the southern gate.
 Hundreds of soldiers stacked against it, their shields braced and ready.
 All along the walls, archers released arrow after arrow into the darkness.
 ‚ÄúHow are we to get closer?‚Äù Qurrah asked.
 ‚ÄúIgnore them,‚Äù Harruq said.

‚ÄúI do,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúI pray I do not disappoint.‚Äù
 He closed his eyes, his hands stretched to either side.
 His fingers hooked and curled in strange ways, many times so twisted and odd that Harruq could not bear to watch them dance.
 Words spilled from the frail half-orc‚Äôs lips.
 Some were strong, demanding, while others came limping out, twisted in form and barely existing as they were meant to exist.
 The words, however, did not matter as much as the dark power rolling forth from Qurrah.
 His sheer will would determine the full strength of the spell.
 A cold wind came blasting in, seemingly from all directions.
 Faster and faster, the words poured from Qurrah‚Äôs pale lips.

 The fact she's also a submissive only makes things worse."
 It was terribly vindictive, and wonderfully appealing.
 I felt a smile tugging at the ends of my mouth.
 "She won't eat me if I do that?"
 His chuckle pulled my smile wider.
 "No.

If I want to become a baseball star, I should look for a coach or mentor whose character and lessons I can believe in.
 If I believe in Mother Teresa, I should read about her and talk to those who knew her and attend to whatever I learn.
 To the extent that we follow Christ‚Äôs example, give of our selves, our time and resources to help people in need, allow time away from the crowds to contemplate and pray, put aside our self concerns and turn to concern for others, our minds and hearts get invaded and possessed by the Holy Spirit.
 And in that condition, the world transforms before our eyes.
 For passing out food, clothing or loving concern we always get blessed, and while we live with a blessed attitude, the most bedraggled people may appear possessed of astonishing beauty, as God must see them.
 When we follow the example of Jesus, through his blessing we begin to perceive the glorious reality of all creation.
 In other words, we enter heaven in all its beauty.

 James 4: 17 in the King James declares, ‚ÄúTherefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.‚Äù The New International Version reads ‚ÄúAnyone, then, who knows the good he ought to do and doesn‚Äôt do it, sins."
 The New American Standard‚Äôs version is, ‚ÄúTherefore, to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin.‚Äù Put these translations together, they insist that to do good is the right thing and what we ought to do.

‚ÄúYou also didn‚Äôt tell us that you were to be picked from the best.
 Congratulations!‚Äù She hugged me.
 ‚ÄúUm,‚Äù I choked out in surprise as I was squeezed, ‚ÄúI wanted it to be‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶a surprise.‚Äù I managed to get the words out and seem intelligent.
 My mom released me from her clamp-like hug, ‚ÄúWell I am surprised, and very proud!‚Äù ‚ÄúThank you?‚Äù I said slowly.
 This must have been the dwarf‚Äôs plan.
 Would have been nice if he had warned me, I thought bitterly.
 My dad got up and glowed happily behind my mom.
 ‚ÄúWe are very proud, Jazell.
 You‚Äôre supposed to leave tomorrow, so you better pack.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go do that.‚Äù I said quickly, while I backed up towards the stairs.
 As soon as I reached them, I shot up so fast you would think I was running for my life.

We spent our evenings with the fellow who had picked us and invited us to flop with him and his roommates.
 The three of them were carpenters, down from New York and New Jersey for the winter.
 Bobby Casso was one of them.
 He claimed his dad was a Mafioso until he got on some capo‚Äôs hit list and fled to parts unknown.
 Bobby was a master storyteller, and one of his stories pierced my soul.
 In summers, Bobby worked as a bartender at the Left Bank, a saloon in Lindenhurst, Long Island.
 One of the regulars was Jack Kerouac.
 My only living hero, according to Bobby, had become nothing more than a woeful drunk who sat brooding over his liquor until closing time.
 Then, most every evening, he went home with whatever washed out female lasted so long.

And at those schools, when she met a new crowd of young folks just launching out toward their dreams, she wondered how much she had given up by marrying a fellow who already thought about retiring, which caused me to wonder in turn if I should I steel myself to prepare for another breakup?
 And should I make sure that if it came I wouldn‚Äôt again have to slog through the morass of missing my kid.
 Pam continued vacillating.
 One month she would talk about our child-to-be.
 The next month, she would find any such talk distasteful and contend that that her schoolwork was all her mind could process.
 No kid until she passes her exams, I resolved.
 Last October, she passed them with distinction.
 The dissertation would take a year or two but, hoping she could read and write a little while pregnant and while caring for a baby, I suggested that now was the time, if ever.
 Sure, celebrities and other billionaires father kids when they‚Äôre ancient, but they can afford nannies who take screaming babies for walks in the park, and they can ship the kids off to boarding schools when as teenagers they metamorphose into demons.
 My big kids are great, and I mean great in the most literal sense.

 Harruq blushed.
 ‚ÄúNo need for lies,‚Äù he said.
 The elf laughed a little but said nothing.
 Instead, she walked over and gave Harruq a quick peck on the cheek.
 ‚ÄúKeep your big butt safe, okay?‚Äù she said.
 The half-orc tried to answer but his mouth refused to cooperate.
 Somehow, it seemed to have become unhinged.
 Besides, it wasn‚Äôt as if he could think of anything to say.
 All his mind could concentrate on was the feel of the elf‚Äôs soft lips on his cheek, the flowery scent of her perfume mixed with sweat, and the quick brush of her breasts against his arm.

I'd tried climbing it dozens of times over the years before finally making it to the top when I was thirteen.
 When I'd finally made it as high as I figured was safe, I'd worked my trembling way back down to the ground, and never felt even the slightest inclination to climb it again.
 I felt tears start to gather at the corner of my eyes as I remembered all of the good times our family had spent together there.
 It was like being immersed in everything I'd loved only to have it evaporate when I went to grab my surroundings.
 "Hey, that's really pretty good.
 Is that a real place?"
 I nodded, hoping Alec would take the hint implied in my silence.
 I should have known better.
 "What's it called?"
 The name slid out of me almost of its own accord.

Of course I did make a couple of stipulations."
 The music started up before I could ask what he meant.
 Almost before I realized what was going on, I found myself twirling through some kind of modified waltz.
 For the first time in my life, I was glad Dad had drilled me for all of those weeks when I'd turned twelve.
 My first dance had still been complete and utter misery, but at least I managed not to trip over my own feet as Alec led me around the room in time to archaic music.
 The rest of the pack fell into formation around us, all dancing much more proficiently than me.
 James and Dominic led the way, with Jasmin and Rachel dancing off to our left.
 Amazingly enough, Isaac and Jessica were far and away the best; he was leading her through steps that were at least twice as hard as anything we were trying.
 For maybe the first time I'd ever seen, Jessica was happy.
 She seemed completely in her element, utterly oblivious to the number of people watching her every move, and I felt just a little of my resentment dissolve.

Rodregas responded, ‚ÄúWell, a true trained war horse can help directly, but what I am worried about is escaping after an attack.
 Even if we have a successful raid against an Immortalist, we will need to be far away before a large group of The Immortal Guard can track us down.
 The Immortal Guards, or at least their officers, use Dire Steeds.
 If we are mounted on regular horses and they come after us on Dire Steeds, well, they will track us down and outnumber us the first time we strike.‚Äù  Doi‚Äôvan nodded at that.
 Rodregas had the impression that he had not thought of anything but the actual fight.
 Imeralda said, ‚ÄúOk, that is all fine.
 You two need to find Dire Steeds and magic armor and weapons before you fight the Immortal Guards.
 Good luck finding that up here in the mountains.
 What I need, and I think you two do as well; is to practice magic.‚Äù Imeralda smirked at their expressions.
 She continued, ‚ÄúLook, I am partly being selfish.

Or they were about to do something that fell under their category of ‚Äúfunny‚Äù.
 ‚ÄúHi guys,‚Äù Seth said still fighting a smirk.
 ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù I replied cautiously.
 ‚ÄúWhat are you guys hiding?‚Äù Jason‚Äôs face twisted up and a snort of laughter fought its way out of his nose.
 ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù ‚ÄúRight‚Ä¶‚Äù Emily gave me a look that said, is this good or bad?
 I didn‚Äôt really have an answer for her but I knew that whatever was coming, it wasn‚Äôt going to be good.
 ‚ÄúSo Jason, we have a question for you.‚Äù I nodded towards Emily.
 Jason‚Äôs face grinned in a seriously weird way that screamed, ‚Äòweirdo!‚Äô He shifted his hands and said, ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Emily stepped forward, ‚ÄúWe want to know what you‚Äôre‚Ä¶‚Äù but she never finished.
 She had triggered it all.
 Jason had been hiding two blue, full, water pistols behind his back and was now shooting them at Emily‚Äôs face.

 ‚ÄúExcuse me.

 Ruby continued, ‚ÄúSteed said you had a guest so I just used the back‚Ä¶‚Äù She trailed off when his stare didn‚Äôt soften, but she smiled.

If you get a free shot at an Immortal Guard, take it, but we need to reduce the numbers against us.‚Äù ‚ÄúImeralda, you need to stay away from the close-in fighting.
 Get as far back as you can and still be able to see and shoot into the road.
 You will focus on the front of the caravan and also focus on the regular slavers.
 Don‚Äôt start shooting until Doi‚Äôvan does, hold steady until they get close and then use your Forest Nymph skills to fade back into the trees well away from the fighting.‚Äù Then he said very carefully, so she would understand, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get yourself killed.
 But if you can stop and turn, take a few more shots.
 If they again turn and charge, you run and don‚Äôt stop running.
 Forget the horses; you will be much harder to track without them.‚Äù He was about to ask Imeralda how long until they would arrive, when Rodregas started to hear noises from up the road.
 The party carrying the captives had arrived.
 Rodregas held a finger to his lips and waved Imeralda deeper into the trees.
 With any luck she would be safe; it was hard to catch a Forest Nymph who was trying not to be found in the trees.

The spirit immediately hushed.
 A bit of coherence came to his eyes, and he glared down at the half-orc.

 The spirit glared harder.
 ‚ÄúDid his tongue die with him?‚Äù Harruq asked.

While there were straps to adjust it, his new body was very large and he would never wear the beautiful armor.
 He threw the armor on the bed.
 It might not work for him to wear, but he could get a good amount of money selling such fancy armor.
 It was the first item of real worth that he had found.
 On a shelf above it was another small pile of the silver chain.
 When he pulled it up he saw that it was a helmet, a solid Mithril skullcap with sides of chain mail designed to be connected at the bottom.
 He reached up and pulled it on his head, but even his head was too large for the AElfin style Mithril armor.
 It quickly joined the suit of armor and the candleholder on the bed.
 On the bottom shelf he found a nice pair of boots, not of AElven make.
 Attached were matching grieves, armor designed to protect the lower leg., and a pair of armored gauntlets to compete the set.

A vision, I believe, of what Cassady could have become had he overcome his demons.
 So, I sit on my porch and dream myself back to the morning when Cliff and I woke up in a Tijuana riverbed.
 Instead of what happened, I tell Cliff I‚Äôm going on the road to find Kerouac.
 Then I drive Route 66 and the turnpike from Chicago, 3000 miles to the Left Bank Bar in Lindenhurst, Long Island, where Bobby Casso introduces Jack and me.
 We talk about everything, including God and tequila, and at the right moment, I tell him about the light.
 His eyes open wider.
 Still in my dream, I'm back home when a postcard arrives, from Jack, who writes that he‚Äôs gone and found his daughter, Jan, who would otherwise also die young, and they‚Äôre going to live in peace, joy, and love, now and for eternity.
 And they might help save Neal Cassady.
 Shanghai
 While going through my boxes of Eric‚Äôs treasures, I find myself hoping that somehow God, in eternity, will bless Sylvia in spite of her meanness.

There would be severe practical obstacles to such a vast expansion of croplands, but these findings suggest that physical limitations to food production are not the primary constraints.
 A more commonly accepted estimate indicates that the world‚Äôs land and water used for agriculture could more than double.
 Agriculture‚Äôs Dual Role
 Achieving food security necessitates increasing food production and employment opportunities.
 Agriculture plays a dual role in the abolition of hunger ‚Äì it produces the food and it can also produce a great many of the jobs needed by households to buy food in developing countries.
 Since agriculture is the world‚Äôs single largest employer, raising production and productivity in this sector can immediately place additional purchasing power in the hands of the rural poor, who will in turn utilize the additional income for purchasing more food, clothing and other basic consumer goods that will create more jobs and higher incomes for countless others.
 The increased agricultural produce becomes raw material for a wide range of agro-based industries and services that stimulate formation of new enterprises, and create downstream jobs as well as products for further processing, domestic sale or export.
 This is the rationale behind the Prosperity 2000 strategy for India, which forms a viable model for many other countries to emulate.
 Promoting job creation in agriculture appears at first glance to contradict the global trend of the past hundred years, in which employment in this sector has declined steadily from historic highs of more than 70 per cent in the industrial nations to the point where, today, only 2 per cent of the workforce in the UK, 3 per cent in the USA and 4 per cent in Germany are directly engaged in farm operations, although a much larger percentage of the workforce in these countries work in businesses and industries linked to agriculture.
 Nevertheless, this strategy follows a natural course of development that has occurred in many countries which now have a relatively small portion of their workforce in agriculture.

I was only gone for about 30 minutes or so and the next thing I know when I came back Gene is talking with these people about God and Jesus and eternal salvation and stuff.
 He‚Äôs nodding along, and looking as if he is really interested in eternal damnation.
 They lead him inside to talk more, and I don‚Äôt see him for several days.
 Art ‚Äì I thought I kept up with the wild and wacky adventures of Gene, but I don‚Äôt remember any of this happening.
 Jim ‚Äì It was during the divorce.
 Gene‚Äôs response was to protest God.
 Art ‚Äì He is a creative kid, too bad his energies aren‚Äôt focused to a better cause.
 If he‚Äôd apply himself he would make a fantastic fiction writer.
 Ah well, Gene is Gene, doubtful that he would ever change.

In the 1950s, the Soviet Union managed to recover from the horrendous destruction it suffered during the Second World War and to embark on a period of rapid industrial growth without any external assistance.
 But today, without having passed through the ravages of war, the republics desperately seek foreign support and feel helpless without it.
 It is right that the world community should generously support the successful completion of the reform process in this region that is so vital for world peace.
 But it is also right that these countries should recognize the enormous untapped potentials which they possess ‚Äì human, natural and productive ‚Äì rather than be distracted by the prospect of a large influx of foreign capital.
 ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY IN YUGOSLAVIA
 The extreme damage wrought by the economic reform programme in these countries over the past half decade necessitates an urgent search for more viable alternatives, a search that has been retarded until now by the widely held view that none exists.
 Very recent events in Yugoslavia suggest that even in the limited area of economic stabilization and adjustment, an alternative strategy can be more successful.
 Although the long-term impact of the Yugoslav experiment is an yet unknown, its remarkably positive initial results merit serious consideration.
 The economic disorder that accompanied recent political developments in Yugoslavia resulted in an explosive increase in prices of more than 100 per cent per month in 1992.
 Despite efforts to control monetary expansion, hyperinflation exceeded three million per cent in 1993 - far higher than the inflation rate reached in Germany following the First World War and, quite probably, the highest rate in recorded history.

Depending on their sigils, they were likely to be either faster or stronger or both.
 But Rodregas‚Äô short swords would not cut their armor.
 It put them at an extreme disadvantage.
 As the arrows flew over his head, he became aware of the other disadvantage of bows.
 They were dealing with a limited supply of arrows; once the arrows where all shot, they lost their main advantage.
 Rodregas heard the noise of the first soldier to rush from the road; he went low and swung hard.
 Rodregas hit knee high and the man trying to run by went flying head first into the dirt.
 Rodregas knew from the feel of the blow that his sword had hit armor and bounced off.
 It was an Immortal Guard.
 Doi‚Äôvan shot another arrow almost straight down into the back of the neck of the downed guard.

Several times, he placed a candy heart on his tongue, chewed slowly, and washed it down with the wine we had brought.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to tell you,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúThe big change still hasn‚Äôt come, but it‚Äôs getting awfully close.‚Äù ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I argued, ‚Äúyou already got kicked out of school, you‚Äôre working full-time and don‚Äôt much hang out with friends anymore.
 Now you‚Äôre ready to start adult school, right?
 Did you sign up yet?‚Äù ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnyway, do you hear that word, adult?
 Becoming an adult, that‚Äôs got to be the big change.
 It‚Äôs about the biggest there is.‚Äù He picked up a handful of sand and let it sift through his fingers.
 ‚ÄúI wish it was.
 I mean, I shouldn‚Äôt.
 That‚Äôs just being a coward, to wish for things to stay like they are.

Being here was like being on vacation, she'd told him.
 He sipped his tea, trying to imagine what this was all really like for her.
 He remembered his first trip to Europe, the summer after he‚Äôd graduated from college.
 He'd spent a month in Great Britain and had loved it.
 But if he'd had to stay there forever, he would have been unbearably homesick.
 He would have missed his family, his home, the comfortable familiarity of the city and country where he'd grown up.
 And how much worse would it have been if he'd been snatched away against his will?
 And unable to communicate with his family and friends?
 His heart began to ache for her.
 She had parents she loved, parents she knew were worried about her.

Everything had bigger wheels, and suspension that lifted it up several inches.
 Vincent's truck had more in common with the beasts in monster truck rallies than it did with the souped-up vehicles I'd seen driving around town.
 The tires were the biggest I'd seen on anything outside of a tractor, and the lift kit on it was so outrageously tall that I was pretty sure someone was going to have to lift me into the cab.
 By myself it was going to take a rope and climbing shoes.
 Of course it was black.
 I couldn't imagine Vincent in anything other than a black vehicle.
 Predictably, Vincent was rubbing down his vehicle, but the exercise seemed more targeted to giving him a chance to walk around with his shirt off than it did with cleaning up the already immaculate truck.
 Based on the way the cheerleader types by the garage were watching him, it was working.
 I much preferred Brandon's jeans and tee shirt, tight as it was, over the shorts and shirtless look, but apparently I was in the minority.
 I almost hyperventilated when Vincent casually walked out of the house with a pair of beer kegs and tied them down in the bed of his pickup.

Rodregas saw Korin‚Äôs bulging eyes as he tried to get a better look at his captor.
 Korin struggled but not as if his life depended on it.
 He was probably confused.
 The image of the day that Rodregas had started to hate him came back.
 A family of AElves had been taken prisoner; they were just common AElves with no real magic.
 Korin was interested in the father, a good-looking man.
 The wife was equally beautiful and they had a slim child named Jorin.
 Rodregas had taken Jorin under his wing.
 He had only been working at Raven Keep for a little over a year at the time and was still learning the names of the prisoners.
 Rodregas had thought that Jorin was a good lad, well behaved and bright, and his eyes were eager for signs of hope.

‚ÄúCome brother, the night is waning fast,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 Harruq shifted the body to a more comfortable position.
 ‚ÄúLead the way.‚Äù
 The two slipped out the front door and into the night.
 Upon arriving home, Harruq tossed the body into the far room, stripped off his gorgeous black armor, and plopped down onto the bed.
 ‚ÄúNight, Qurrah,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúSorry, but that elfie wore me out, and I never thought cleaning a place could be so tiring.
 I need to rest.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúGood night, then,‚Äù Qurrah replied, crawling onto his side of the uncomfortable bed.
 He curled his rags about him and drifted off to sleep, pleasant memories of the battle looping in his mind.

He did chuckle a bit as he said, ‚ÄúFirst, you want me to admit that I killed an Immortalist Sorcerer, and when I do, you don‚Äôt believe me.
 An old soldier like me just can‚Äôt win.‚Äù Van‚Äôdret was too smart not to pick up his hint, ‚ÄúAn old soldier?‚Äù he asked very quietly.
 ‚ÄúMy turn to ask a question,‚Äù said Rodregas.
 ‚ÄúHow did you connect the three of us to these crimes?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret shrugged and smiled and said, ‚ÄúTo be honest, I did not really think you were the ones.
 I simply did not like you, and the way you hung out with non-Celestials.
 It is unnatural.
 Now, it is my turn to ask a question.‚Äù ‚ÄúActually,‚Äù interrupted Rodregas, ‚Äúyou already asked me about being an old soldier.
 Let me answer that first.
 I was a sergeant in Ravenhurr‚Äôs guard and I am afraid I have become what I learned to hate more than anything, an Immortalist.‚Äù Rodregas paused and took a deep breath.
 What he said next was hard even for himself to say, ‚ÄúIn truth, I am an old man who had his time on this world and did not do much with it.

The use of and trade in narcotics represents a menace not only to the health and well-being of individuals and societies, but also to international security.
 The scale of the problem can be judged by the reported fact that Americans, who represent five per cent of the world‚Äôs population, consume fifty per cent of the world‚Äôs cocaine.
 In Pakistan, where there were virtually no drug addicts a decade ago, it has been reported that as many as 3 per cent of the population are addicted and thrice that number use drugs frequently.
 The CIS has now been added to the traditional drugs routes emanating from the Peru‚ÄìColombia‚ÄìPanama, Pakistan‚ÄìAfghanistan, and Myanmar‚ÄìThailand‚ÄìLaos regions.
 The drugs menace is transnational in character with far-reaching implications for societal and international peace and security.
 The countries and regions which produce these drugs, and through which the trade flows, have been afflicted by endemic violence and social turbulence.
 A similar impact occurs at the point of concentrated consumption, especially in the inner cities of America, where crime and murder rates have soared due to drug-related violence.
 Inevitably, drug trafficking is linked with illicit arms, terrorist groups and the Mafia.
 Criminal elements are increasingly gaining control over the administrative and political structures of drug-producing states, where drug-related corruption permeates the military and government.
 Neither the proliferation of small arms, nor the proliferation of drugs, nor the growth of terrorist and criminal activity can be solved as isolated problems, or by the independent initiatives of individual states.

The smile gracing his breathtaking face was like the ultimate treat.
 "Oh, I was helping out with the new set for the theater class' production of Arsenic and Old Lace."
 I was suddenly glad Britney had abandoned me.
 If it resulted in me seeing Brandon again today it couldn't be all bad.
 In fact, my life felt pretty much perfect right now.
 Wait, not quite.
 If he'd greeted me with a hug in addition to the smile, then things would have been perfect.
 I felt myself blushing almost as soon as the thought crossed my mind.
 My family wasn't...hadn't been demonstrative.
 I wouldn't know what to do if he hugged me.

We stopped under the canopy of a red oak and Steed grabbed me as I slid awkwardly from the horse.
 ‚ÄúYou may ask him to kneel, Elfreda.‚Äù Not that he appeared to mind handling me about the waist to help me down.
 Looking up at him, I pushed the hair away from my face.
 ‚ÄúYes, well, I guess I should start practicing.‚Äù Heat brushed my skin as the fire Chevelle was building flared.
 It returned to its proper size and Chevelle commanded, ‚ÄúSit, Elfreda.‚Äù Steed followed as I walked to a fallen limb by the fire and settled atop the widest part, drawing my legs up from the ground.
 He sat as well, apparently not concerned about who was finding us breakfast.
 Irritation rolled off Chevelle as he ran into the thick line of trees that bordered the clearing.
 In only a moment he was back, carrying three large, white birds.
 ‚ÄúWhere is your bow?‚Äù I asked.
 Steed‚Äôs laugh was loud.

He nodded.
 He was closer now, sitting opposite me, and I had the disconcerting feeling that I‚Äôd lost the bit of time when he‚Äôd moved there.
 He reached out and took my hand in his, his fingers gentle as he turned it palm up to place a pebble there.
 ‚ÄúCan you do anything with this?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Frustration was clear in my voice.
 I had already tried.
 ‚ÄúAnd no fire?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo nothing works?‚Äù The implication was there, but I didn‚Äôt know what it meant right away.
 And then it occurred to me.
 The horse.
 I had thought he had shown up because I‚Äôd impressed upon him to follow before I blacked out, but I had already been bound again at that point.

 ‚ÄúGoodnight Emily.‚Äù ‚ÄúGoodnight Jazell.‚Äù I drifted off, feeling surprising comfy against Seth's shoulder and hearing Jason softy snore.
 I opened my eyes to see myself standing in the woods.
 The sky saw clearer and it wasn't raining anymore.
 It was eerie quiet and as I stood there it felt like I had never left the woods.

She had no doubt of this man‚Äôs identity; he was the nameless necromancer, one of the few who could best Scoutmaster Dieredon in combat.
 ‚ÄúStop, you cannot defeat him,‚Äù she shouted.
 None listened.
 ‚ÄúFelewen, please!‚Äù
 Felewen glanced back to her, and that small pause saved her life.
 The man in black had made no threatening move as the other two charged.
 They were almost upon him when he cast aside his hood to reveal his ever-changing face, his deep red eyes, and his horrible smile.
 His hands lunged forward, the floodgates opened, and all his power came rushing forth.
 A wall of black magic rolled like a tidal wave conjured from his fingertips.
 The elven brothers tumbled through and vanished.

‚ÄúPlease, my friend, there is no need for subservience here; let us enjoy a meal together.
 If you don‚Äôt mind, I have a few thoughts I would like to share with you over the food.‚Äù ‚ÄúOf course, my lord,‚Äù said Van‚Äôdret as he stood up he dared to focus on the Guild Dealer for the first time.
 Taiga wore the form of a High Elf male that was slim and graceful, as was most of its kind.
 His hair and eyes were a striking pale violet color, and his skin was a light nut color which made a strong contrast with his hair.
 This was highlighted by the similarly colored silk toga he wore.
 He wore no rings or accessories, his outfit simple, but extravagant.
 Van‚Äôdret suddenly wished he had thought to dress simpler for the occasion his green and emerald outfit with its gold trim seemed garish in comparison; and his human male form that normally seemed attractive and robust seemed ungainly and drab in comparison.
 Taiga‚Äôs manner continued to be friendly but inquisitive.
 The conversation started with a polite discussion on new spells that Van‚Äôdret was working on, and then moved to his thoughts on the recent political and economic tensions with the Romig Empire.
 Wine and food appeared on the table; Van‚Äôdret never saw it come, or the empty plates go.

Albert pushed his glasses a little ways back up his nose, and then wandered off to help the next person with a red card face up on their desk.
 The number of people who proceeded to come into the tutoring lab was nothing less than amazing.
 Based on overheard conversations, it sounded like there was a perfect storm of tests.
 Both of the other math teachers were apparently having tests in every single one of their classes, and Mrs. Campbell was having tests in a couple of hers as well.
 The resulting number of questions kept us all jumping.
 I started work half an hour early, and Albert, Peter and Mrs. Campbell all stayed an extra forty-five minutes.
 I was helping out an undersized freshman who was having a really hard time understanding the fundamental concepts of the unit she was going to be tested over tomorrow when Mrs. Campbell stopped by.
 "We're all done.
 Wait until the end of your normal shift, and then go home.
 If anyone complains feel free to suggest that they don't leave it until the last minute next time."

"What's wrong with that?"
 "It's not safe for her to leave the estate.
 Brandon's pack could be waiting for her."
 He started to move, but I held onto him.
 "Alec, she'll probably be okay.
 I know it isn't the best idea but please don't stop her.
 Not tonight."
 It was like I could see the thoughts dart around as he put pieces together, and I was suddenly torn between telling him in the hopes it would buy Jasmin her last night with Ben, and trying to keep her secret.
 My heart raced until he finally relaxed and sank back down with me.
 "Please don't let on that you know.

At the end of her story, Curly comes over and gives her friend some reasons they need to move along.
 Before they leave, Curly reaches down and rubs my shoulder.
 As more evidence that I‚Äôm slow to catch on, I‚Äôll admit that not until I‚Äôm on my way, in the rain, to Seattle, do I realize Curly‚Äôs touch was the physical part of a blessing.
 She blessed me for listening to her friend‚Äôs whole story, apparently without passing judgment.
 Zo√´ Dot Dot
 While driving I‚Äôm inclined to find fault with others who have the gall to use the same road I do at the same time.
 Especially if they are these fellows who have surrouned me on I-5 north of Vancouver, Washington.
 In the rain, with their semis, they spray torrents at my windshield.
 But recalling that yesterday I got blessed for choosing not to judge, I begin to practice understanding these truck drivers‚Äô concern for time and distance.
 Soon I notice that when I go into critical mode, my awareness of the proximity to God shuts down.

It took all of Harruq‚Äôs strength to resist the urge to cover his ears.

 The spirit immediately hushed.
 A bit of coherence came to his eyes, and he glared down at the half-orc.
 ‚ÄúGreetings, Ahrqur,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúRemember us, the incompetent thieves?‚Äù
 The spirit glared harder.
 ‚ÄúDid his tongue die with him?‚Äù Harruq asked.
 ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt told him he can speak yet,‚Äù Qurrah responded.
 His eyes flicked back from Harruq to the spirit.

Unless greater measures are introduced, this number may rise to more than 160 million by the turn of the century.
 Achieving true universality of primary education by the year 2000 will require a massive investment in school buildings, teachers and instructional materials for an additional 230 million school-age children.
 An additional 4 million teachers will be required, 20 per cent more than in 1990.
 In sub-Saharan Africa, gross primary enrolment will have to double before year 2000 to achieve this goal.
 In addition to the quantitative deficiency in educational enrolment and achievements, the quality of teaching facilities, materials and staff is severely deficient in many countries.
 Most developing countries hire teachers with only a secondary school certificate and a minimum of teachers‚Äô training.
 This contributes to the high rate of primary school drop-outs and grade repetition.
 Only 71 per cent of first-grade entrants complete primary school in developing countries.
 Addressing these challenges will require a substantial increase in financial resources devoted to education.
 In most regions, public expenditure on education has risen in recent years.

I never do stuff like that, never.
 But I guess my mind was tired of seeing the same thing over and over again.
 I wish it would get interesting.
 Oh, it was going to get really interesting.
 The ground rumbled and we both stopped dead.
 I looked at the earth and cracks appeared.
 Then dirt started to cave in.
 I screeched as the ground gave way under me.
 Can my life get any worse?

 It was hunched over, with thick furry skin and wicked claws that shot out of its curled paws.
 We would soon know them as thrashers, beasts we would get used to seeing.
 I don‚Äôt know who screeched louder in fear, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it might have been me.
 Seth pulled his sword out but his hand shook like mad.
 I clumsily pulled an arrow out of the quiver on my back and struggled to attach it to my bow.

 I exchanged a look with Seth, but he looked as clueless as I did.

A knowledge of astronomy enabled sea-worthy vessels to travel across the oceans to distant lands.
 This led to the invention of systematic education as a method to pass on acquired knowledge and skills to the next generation and thereby continuously increase them.
 The Ultimate Resource
 These rich and varied discoveries came as the result of a careful observation and analysis of the external world around us, an infinite exploration and experimentation with things, an endless trial and error blending of minerals and plants to forge metals and produce medicines.
 As a result, for millennia we have tended to overlook or, at best, grossly underestimate the greatest of all resources and the true source of all the discoveries, inventions, creativity and productive power found in nature ‚Äì the resource that has made minerals into ships that sail the skies, fashioned grains of sand into tiny electronic brains, released the energy of the sun from the atom, modified the genetic code of plants to increase their vigour and productivity ‚Äì the ultimate resource, the human being.
 World Food Prize recipient and father of India‚Äôs milk revolution, Dr V. Kurien, has decried the tendency to credit external factors for the accomplishment of people.
 ‚ÄòIt is the farmer that has produced this miracle, not the cow.‚Äô And so it can be said of the Industrial Revolution and the Green Revolution.
 Looked at from a different perspective, the entire evolution of civilization is a progressive act of humanity‚Äôs self-discovery.
 At each stage of external observation and exploration, people have discovered more of their own inner capacity for resourcefulness.
 The material, technological, political, economic and social development of the world over countless centuries is an external expression of the growing discovery by humanity of the unlimited creative power of mental ideas, emotional aspirations, physical skills and higher values.

I was on a horse, running.
 Not my own.
 Chevelle was holding me in front of him, my body limp and useless.
 I fought to focus on more but was overtaken by pain.
 We were running away?
 I could control nothing but my mind, and that just barely.
 As my eyes closed again, I reached out and found my horse as he lay motionless on the ground, my Steed.
 He wasn‚Äôt dead.
 I asked him to stand and tried to impress upon him to follow.
 I hoped it had worked as I faded into blackness.

 Maybe if you call up Mr. Peters you'll be able to work something out."
 Actually I was positive Mr. Peters would be amiable to the idea.
 At least he would be if Alec had remembered to work whatever magic he'd used on the Mayor the first time.
 Of course it was possible he'd forgotten to make the arrangements, but somehow I doubted it.
 Mom looked like she was starting to waver.
 "It does seem like a great opportunity, but there just isn't any good way to know for sure it's legitimate."
 That didn't sound like Alec at all.
 "Are you sure, Mom?
 They didn't arrange anything you could use to verify they're for real?"

The achievement of food self-sufficiency by India in a period when famine threatened millions of lives through the power of political will and scientific action in a democratic society illustrates this truth.
 In spite of such uncommon opportunities for a better common present, during the last six years the world has been witness to an escalation of ethnic and mini-conflicts, growing intolerance of diversity, the spread of small arms, an increase in violence starting with violence to oneself through drug addiction and damage to the life support systems of land, water, flora, fauna and the atmosphere.
 In addition, the current pattern of economic and technological growth is leading to gross social inequity and rising joblessness.
 The rich-poor divide is widening both within and among nations.
 At the same time, the spread of knowledge and information, particularly through the electronic media, has led to an era of rising expectations.
 The economically and socially underprivileged sections of human society are now aware that their future is not a question of fate, but of political and technological choice.
 If they are not given access to the information superhighways and other technological highways to progress, a new form of social and economic apartheid will spread, which will be even more serious in its consequences to the future of human civilization than the skin-colour-based apartheid which has just ended.
 True education is leadership in thought.
 There are periods in human history when the progress of decades can be accomplished in a few years.
 It is the view of the Commission that we have arrived at one of these great, creative moments.

He hadn't even been willing to let his friends step in and stop the fight.
 I drifted off to History thinking that I would've done almost anything to save my sister.
 It would take a real heartless individual to abandon their own family.
 My anger buffered me just enough to think about Cindi without the usual consequences, but I still wasn't really in top form.
 I was halfway through my class before I realized Mr. Simms had been shooting me dark looks for the last twenty minutes.
 They weren't the obvious nasty looks that kids shoot each other of course.
 They were subtle and infrequent but there was something about the set of his mouth that made it clear he wasn't pleased I was in his class.
 I shrugged it all off and gutted my way through class, eagerly planning what I'd say to Alec when I saw him in physics, only when I finally stalked into Mrs. Alexander's class Alec wasn't sitting in his corner desk.
 I pulled out my notes and started reviewing what I'd managed to learn about our project, stalling until he arrived so I could give him a piece of my mind.
 Only he never walked through the door.

The fact that my body was, at least partly, still on Minnesota time should have helped, but the morning was just as unbearable as normal.
 Fighting back a yawn, I flipped on my bedroom light and examined the half-dozen boxes that might contain my clothes.
 I debated searching through them all, but it would just mean another fight if I did find them.
 With a sigh of resignation I walked over to the chair where I'd left my selections from the night before, and pulled the faded jeans up my frail-looking legs.
 I finished up with a tank top, covered by a light blue blouse.
 All Cindi's stuff.
 Thoughts of her were just as dangerous as they'd been last night, but maybe I was getting a little better.
 Feeling like a traitor, I headed my skittering thoughts off before they could start affecting me physically, and focused on the next step in getting ready.
 There was a lot more at stake this morning than last night.
 If I fell apart now I might not make it to school, and then I'd have all kinds of trouble calming Mom back down when she returned from wherever she'd gone.

 "Well, sort of.

It's actually a relief to tell you.
 There are so many open secrets around here.
 It comes from living in such close quarters, from everyone being able to hear what's said anywhere in the house.
 It feels good to be able to share them with you."
 I returned his smile and tried not to focus on questions of just how much of the fluttering in my stomach was due to natural attraction for him, and how much was due to mystical heebie-jeebies.
 "For my part, I'm just glad you're telling me something for once instead of continuing to keep me in the dark."
 He released my chin and ran a finger down the side of my face.
 "Well, then I'm afraid I'll have to trade upon your current satisfaction to beg your leave.
 As much as I'd rather stay here and bask in your beauty, it's time for more training."
 I tried to keep the disappointment from my face, but his expression fell a little despite my best efforts.

He scanned the battlefield while they whirled up and down, over one hand and then dancing away from another.
 Just as Sonowin pulled higher and higher into the air, outracing more than seven growing hands reaching up for them, the elf spotted two lone figures amid the sea of dead.
 ‚ÄúSonowin,‚Äù he shouted to his steed.
 ‚ÄúThere, you must get to them!‚Äù
 The horse snorted, banked around, and dove straight for the approaching hands.
 A quick spiral avoided the first wave.
 Dieredon clutched his bow and held on for dear life, his eyes locking on the man in black who stood perfectly still, his arms at downward angles from his body.
 The rest of the elves were in full retreat.

Cliff was more sensible.
 He said my mom could be right.
 I didn't relent until after his mom lectured us in practically the same words.
 Whatever the meaning of Eric‚Äôs death, it might've been losing him that convinced me to give up on Karen Flagstad.
 Anymore, the whole idea of having a best friend spooked me.
 Better to keep my secret life to myself and guard my heart than to trust somebody I was almost sure to lose---because that was how life worked---and mourn over.
 But then, in that way life has of confusing every issue, Karen invited me to be her graduation partner, which meant only walking side-by-side in a procession.
 Still I invited her to the prom.
 She accepted.
 Then a girl passed along a rumor that Liz Pence wanted to go out with me.

 Later in the evening at Liz‚Äôs art show, but all the people are gone now, and most of the extra exhibit lights have been turned off.
 Jim is sitting on the floor still reading his comic book and a paper sack, waiting.

‚ÄúOr maybe it‚Äôll be terrible.
 All I know is, it‚Äôll make getting expelled and the rest look like kid stuff.‚Äù The next day, Saturday, according to Sylvia, he spent reading Heart of Darkness for the second straight time.
 On breaks from the story, he returned to his winnowing.
 He loaded a garbage can with old board games and school papers and gave a couple of pairs of jeans to a neighbor boy.
 He even tossed out the charred and bent pan he used to make popcorn since he had grown tall enough to reach the stovetop.
 That evening, when I called to ask if he wanted to go to the cut-rate movies or shoot pool with Billy and me, he was probably home.
 But Sylvia had gone out with Richard, and nobody answered the phone.
 Billy spent the night at my place.
 We had plans for the next day.
 Billy and I, Eric, and Kenny were going to drive up the coast to Laguna Beach, for the annual sidewalk art festival.

And we went at it, you know, it was a real relationship, even that young.
 Hell, we were kids.
 But, when I wasn‚Äôt writing, playing, I was with her‚Äîlet‚Äôs call her Debbie because every girl back then was named Debbie‚Äîin front of her house, practicing our manumission, handjobs and fingerings and oral sex.
 In the car, on the front porch, in the backyard.
 Hell, still, that was some of the best sex I ever had‚ÄîLor understands, don‚Äôt sweat that, man‚Äîbut, you know, that first flush of what you, at least at the time, call love, and access to another person‚Äôs body, the most personal parts of their body‚Äîwhat a joy!
 What undiluted joy!
 So, we went at it, like I say, like a couple of hamsters in heat.
 That was freshman year.
 That was while I was starting to play everywhere around town‚ÄîI was like almost famous, you know.

More than 35 million Americans, constituting 14 per cent of the population, are living on incomes below the poverty line, including 30 per cent of all blacks and Hispanics.
 Western European unemployment rates are at the highest level in 30 years.
 They are projected soon to reach 12 per cent or 18 million people and remain high throughout the decade, prompting the outgoing European Union President, Jacques Delors, to call employment Europe‚Äôs ‚ÄòAchilles heel‚Äô.
 Youth unemployment rates (aged 16‚Äì19) in the European Community average nearly 20 per cent and nearly 50 per cent of the unemployment is long-term (more than one year).
 The emerging situation poses a challenge to the European concept of the welfare state.
 Employment in Eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union has been severely disrupted by the break-up of COMECON, the dissolution of the USSR and the movement of these countries from centrally planned to market economies.
 From the beginning of 1990 to March 1992, registered unemployment grew from 100,000 to over 4 million and it has continued to rise steeply since then.
 The unemployment rate for ten Eastern European countries now averages around 17 per cent.
 Recent projections indicate that jobless ness in Russia could reach 15 million persons or 18 per cent of the work-force in the near future.
 By far the most serious problem lies in the developing world, where unemployment rates average 40‚Äì50 per cent in many countries.

While the leaser sigils appeared to be simple sculpture empowered by magic, these truly appeared real.
 Yet what magic could capture such powerful beasts for the use of creating sigils?
 Had the greater sigils been gifts to mortals from the Gods themselves?
 Rodregas yearned to reach out and touch to see if they felt like flesh or stone.
 But, to do so would set his path for the rest of his life.
 If he was truly strong enough for two as Imeralda thought, then he could be a lion and what else?
 ‚ÄúWell, Doi‚Äôvan, what do you think?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúI am going to choose lion, but it would be great to have a pride, or maybe the Moon Wolf or the Mountain Bear.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan nodded and walked over to the bear.
 It was a kind of bear that Rodregas had not heard of in the mortal world, even larger than ‚Äòhis‚Äô lion.
 The bear actually had a thick tail and its teeth seemed far larger than any bear he had heard of.

I snorted, and then felt myself turning red with embarrassment.
 You would think after seventeen years I'd have learned how to laugh without making those wretched sounds.
 "As if.
 I can't think of one good thing about everyone having their noses in everyone else's business."
 The smile was back, but it was more mischievous than before.
 "How about me knowing Britney left you high and dry after school today?"
 "Please.
 That just makes the humiliation more painful."
 Brandon shook his head as we pulled to a stop in front of my house.
 "No, that means I can do something about you losing your ride."

Neither one attacked, instead holding their swords in defensive positions.
 Harruq shook his head, feeling his anger growing.
 These men did not fight with their hearts.
 They fought with their heads, and such foolishness could not be tolerated.
 ‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll show you a real warrior,‚Äù he said.
 His muscles tensed, his legs bulged, and then he charged the two, oblivious to his own safety.
 Overwhelming any of their attacks, he was a moving mountain of muscle, dangerous and powerful.
 The meager defenses of the guards faltered.
 One tried to block as Condemnation came for his head.
 The blade broke through and cleaved his skull in two.

"That was amazing.
 Thank you, but you can't keep doing that or she's going to fail you."
 Dominic sagged a little against me.
 "I don't think she will.
 Not after the rest of the class realizes she has a hard time reading the book herself.
 Even if she does, it doesn't really matter.
 I never expected to finish junior high, let alone graduate from high school.
 Besides, James is always talking about dropping out and just getting his GED.
 Maybe I'll follow suit."
 She stiffened slightly as I hugged her, but then smiled and returned the gesture with an earnestness that made me think she hadn't had much in the way of hugs in her life.

Slowly, Rodregas got up with his bear haunch and took it back to the barn.
 He met the surprised look of Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda with a half smile, ‚ÄúI hope you like the taste of bear?‚Äù As he was unsure of how old the meat was, he immediately started a fire and started to cook it.
 As he worked on preparing the fire he explained what had happened.
 ‚ÄúAre you suicidal?‚Äù asked Imeralda in an angry voice.
 ‚ÄúI know you felt they were not a danger, but to walk up and take the food from two Dire Cats?
 That is just asking to be killed.‚Äù Her voice was unusually high pitched and she was shaking her head in disbelief.
 ‚ÄúThe Dire Bear must have been living in the cellar,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúI bet they actually had to go in and kill it there.
 We probably did not hear the battle because it was underground.
 They probably dragged it out after.

I looked to the left and saw a door with a sword on it.
 I sighed and pushed open my door.
 The small room also had glass ceilings but they were dimmer.
 The room was dark and cold, with dust in the air.
 ‚ÄúI was wondering when you would get here,‚Äù a familiar voice said.
 I jumped and looked into one of the corners.
 The girl from my dreams walked out, shimmering.
 She smiled and I then noticed the bow hanging on her back with a quiver of arrows.
 ‚ÄúYou know how you asked for my name before?
 I can tell you now,‚Äù she said.

And then I realized she had called someone a hunk of horsemeat and I had to stifle a giggle.
 Chevelle nodded, but made no remark on the inquirer.
 Ruby winked at him on her way out and the gesture lit a burn in my chest.
 I turned back to my room and climbed into bed, angry at myself more than anything else, and determined not to let him see.
 I covered my head with a corner of the blanket, suffocating my fractured thoughts with the absence of light.
 I was unsure how long I‚Äôd slept.
 The house was quiet when I slipped from bed, trying not to make a sound.
 I peeked into the main room, finding Chevelle sitting against the front wall, a small window over his head.
 He leaned over, working on something in the palm of his hand, a steady scratching accompanying the movement of his wrist.
 I started forward and my boot scuffed the floor, alerting him to my presence.

Job growth has been quite rapid in the developing countries over the last forty years, more than doubling total employment.
 The single most important factor behind rising numbers of unemployed persons and increasing absolute numbers of families below the poverty line in developing countries has been the 2.4-fold expansion of population in the Third World, and more than doubling of the economically active population since 1950, which have resulted in a 4 per cent decline in the overall employment rate.
 Population growth rates continue to fall steadily in most countries, with the exception of Africa, providing an opportu nity for economic growth and job growth to catch up with the population explosion of recent decades.
 Along with rapid quantitative job growth, the global economy has achieved dramatic qualitative gains in the nature of employment.
 During recent decades, there has also been a marked movement away from subsistence level manual occupations, primarily in agriculture, to more skilled and remunerative forms of employment.
 Worldwide, the percentage of the work force engaged in agriculture has fallen by 24 per cent since 1950, from 67 to 51 per cent.
 Unemployment is of growing concern today primarily because population has expanded in recent decades even faster than job creation and because a larger percentage of the population, principally women, seek employment now than at any time in the past.
 The shortages of jobs and the resulting poverty represent the most pressing social problem in the world today.
 But viewed in historical perspective, it is clear that substantial progress has been made during the post-war period, making humanity as a whole more prosperous than at any previous period in recorded history.
 Over the past five decades, global GDP has multiplied seven-fold.

Most of these he recognized as the great totems of the Celestial Realm, each representing great power.
 The great beasts were full-size and, but for their lack of movement, Rodregas would have thought that they must have traveled to the Celestial Realm itself.
 ‚ÄúOh, my Gods, they look real.
 I thought they would be made of stone like the frog,‚Äù said Imeralda.
 Rodregas nodded.
 The beasts looked to be made of flesh and bone, except they all stood perfectly still on short stone pedestals.
 Strangely, the room did not smell of damp stone like the rest of the cathedral, but the air smelled of the outdoors in spring.
 Rodregas‚Äô eyes were drawn to the powerful lion that reared up not far into the gathered animals, and just to the right of the center.
 He walked over to it.
 It looked like it could have been the twin for the beast that had been devoured by the blue flame on top of Raven Keep.

I was closed in just as the main door opened, giving me no more than a glimpse of deep red curls.
 I tried not to be annoyed about being closed in a room.
 I was a prisoner after all.
 Chevelle‚Äôs voice was barely audible as he spoke to his visitor in a formal tone.
 ‚ÄúRuby.‚Äù Ruby?
 Before I could stop myself, I was at the door peering through the frame.
 A tiny crack of light allowed me about three-quarters of Chevelle‚Äôs back and all of his guest.
 Ruby.
 She looked to be a little shorter than me, a little smaller, but seemed larger somehow.
 I thought I knew why.

I tried to pry his fingers from my neck but I couldn‚Äôt get my fingers between his to loosen his grip.
 I finally got one of my hands wrapped around one of his fingers, but it wasn‚Äôt enough to free myself.
 I believed it was going to be over soon and I was going to die.
 I could see him clearly now that my eyes had adjusted to the darkness, and he looked like a madman just inches from my face as he continued to push me up against the door.
 He didn‚Äôt mutter a word from his gritted teeth.
 I don‚Äôt even know if my feet were on the ground.
 I must have passed out because I don‚Äôt remember what happened next.
 I awoke in the entryway and he was gone.
 I rolled to my knees and I could hear the crackle of the puka shells beneath the weight of my body.
 I felt the shells of my coveted necklace sticking to my palms as I tried to steady myself on all fours.

They all really depend on me.
 This whole thing with Jasmin is really crazy; we've got to figure out how best to handle it.
 Maybe it really said all of those things, or maybe I was completely deluded, but it was definitely a smile.
 That alone was enough to make my heart skip a beat, and send a warm tingly feeling lapping through me like a wave of distilled happiness.
 I was halfway through History before I realized there'd been something odd about the discussion at Brandon's table.
 Luckily, Mr. Simms started out the class in usual form.
 It was virtually guaranteed we wouldn't learn anything which was fortunate or I might have missed something.
 Once my mind latched on the question of what had been different than normal, I didn't hear a word anyone else said.
 It wasn't until I was back at my locker and midway between switching out my History book for my Physics notes that I finally realized what it was.
 Normal juniors didn't sit at a lunch table and figure out what to do about anything.

On school days when the ocean beckoned, I might stop by the hospital at visiting hours, wash up and don a smock, spend a few minutes with my mom, and get her to sign absence slips.
 Eric didn‚Äôt need absence slips.
 If he returned to school after an absence and told the attendance clerk he‚Äôd been out with the one-day variety of bubonic plague, she would have excused him rather than phone his mother to verify.
 When anyone from the school called Sylvia, she might hold the person on the phone for an hour, ranting about their misdeeds.
 I have two pictures of Eric.
 His senior picture, given a full page in our senior-year annual, a head shot of keen blue eyes with thick lashes, freckles, and sandy hair, a chin square as Dick Tracy‚Äôs, an easy grin that would have wrongly convinced you he was loaded with confidence.
 And the one Sylvia called the ‚ÄúJesus body picture‚Äù a snapshot somebody took in the locker room.
 Eric in a jock strap, beaming, his legs and arms spread as though to greet a familiar angel.
 Eric was superman.
 Strong, handsome, understanding, considerate, creative, vital, and brilliant.

 The phone buzzed again as Seth sent me a reply.
 See anything?
 Do you want me to meet you?
 I glanced at the nearby woods.
 My ears heard nothing and I didn‚Äôt see any movement but my hands shook slightly as I typed, Nothing, I‚Äôm fine.
 I didn‚Äôt open his reply because I knew what it would say.
 I already knew that it was strangely quiet.
 Maybe I could stay home and sleep one night.
 Or maybe I could finish a painting tonight and watch Mom do origami.

Why he hadn‚Äôt looked at me as I‚Äôd lain under the tree in the meadow, explaining why Fannie had struck me.

 Of course he‚Äôd volunteered to be my watcher.
 I had taken everything from him.
 My thoughts began to muddle as my mother and my dreams and my own life twisted together.
 I still couldn‚Äôt retrieve my memories; I only had the last years, which seemed a haze now.

 I thought of how I had cursed him when I‚Äôd found he was my watcher.
 The hate in my voice when I‚Äôd demanded my memories back.

 Carol Warner, I met at a school dance, where Black Lung played.
 It was in the school cafeteria‚ÄîJesus, those gigs, you gotta love ‚Äòem, right?
 I mean, looking back, you gotta love that shit.
 Girls and boys rubbing against each other, hormones exploding all over the room, while we grind away at some awful cover song like ‚ÄúOne is the Loneliest Number.‚Äù  Occasionally slipping in one of our originals which is met with a silence like we farted in church.
 (laughs)  It was a kick.
 I mean, these couples using the opportunity to practically hump on the dance floor, hands all over asses, the chaperons looking bored over in the corner, old Ricky Glass, the mechanical drawing teacher, toking up.
 What a time that was.

 Marie tried to smile, but the thought of that wedding gown, that symbol of tradition and family and home, upset her.
 Yesterday it had made her long for home.
 Now it made her long for Rick.
 She wanted to wear it for him.

‚ÄúI will take control now,‚Äù he said to his disciple.
 ‚ÄúIn time, the burden of sustaining life in them will seem weightless.
 Until then, let me bear it.
 Look at me.‚Äù
 Qurrah did, his eyes red and his face wet.
 ‚ÄúYes master?‚Äù he asked.
 No weakness tainted his voice.
 The man in black put a hand on either side of Qurrah‚Äôs face and drew him close.
 ‚ÄúBecome a god among men,‚Äù he whispered.
 ‚ÄúRemain faithful to me, and to Karak, and I shall see it come to pass.‚Äù

If we would get everything out by the evening and pull out all of the carpet, he would not pursue damages.
 None of us were prepared for what we saw when we turned the key in the lock and opened the door.
 Paper and cardboard blackened the windows.
 When we removed these window covers, we found broken panes behind them.
 The bedroom doors had been kicked in, and broken bongs and stem pipes, empty cigarette packs, matchbooks, just trash littered every surface.
 I don‚Äôt know what the hell these people (my son!)
 did in here, but the carpet could not have been dirtier if they raised farm animals indoors.
 Pictures of Brandon and his friends holding automatic weapons were nearly the only things upright.
 Sex toys filled the drawers and around his bed.
 Apparently, it had been a real bohemian festival at some point, at least to the people who hung here.

The last thing Rick remembered was Murray, the dog, drinking out of a toilet.
 When he opened his eyes again, the news was on.
 He yawned, wanting to stretch but finding that Marie lay on one arm.
 He looked down at her, smiling.
 Her cheeks were golden and rosy, her long, dark lashes like fans against them.
 Her dark hair fell over his arm and onto the pillow, and he reached up with his free hand to caress it.
 Marie stirred, moving closer to Rick.
 She blinked and found him hovering over her.
 As she gazed up into his eyes, she felt as if she were in a dream.
 This was just like one of her fantasies.

In the car, on the front porch, in the backyard.
 Hell, still, that was some of the best sex I ever had‚ÄîLor understands, don‚Äôt sweat that, man‚Äîbut, you know, that first flush of what you, at least at the time, call love, and access to another person‚Äôs body, the most personal parts of their body‚Äîwhat a joy!
 What undiluted joy!
 So, we went at it, like I say, like a couple of hamsters in heat.
 That was freshman year.
 That was while I was starting to play everywhere around town‚ÄîI was like almost famous, you know.
 Locally.
 Dickinson was there for me, and the gigs started happening and, I had this cheerleader girlfriend, with thighs like hell-roosters, hard, and a great little butt.
 Life was good.
 Classes, shit man, how could anyone concentrate on classes with that going on?

My legs are gonna come off!
 Lalalala!

 That's how much I was sick of walking; I was making a freaking song up in my head.
 I never do stuff like that, never.
 But I guess my mind was tired of seeing the same thing over and over again.
 I wish it would get interesting.
 Oh, it was going to get really interesting.
 The ground rumbled and we both stopped dead.
 I looked at the earth and cracks appeared.

‚ÄúFlee west,‚Äù Jeremiah ordered Corren.
 ‚ÄúAnd take every one you find with you.‚Äù
 The old man put a hand on the young farmer‚Äôs shoulder.
 ‚ÄúFear not,‚Äù he said, a weak smile on his face.
 ‚ÄúAshhur‚Äôs golden eternity awaits us.‚Äù
 Jeremiah raised his sword so that the flame of his torch flickered across it.
 ‚ÄúNot this night, not if I can help it,‚Äù he said before running toward the battle cry.
 The town held only ninety members, half of them younger than eighteen.
 When the second brutal cry rolled over the houses, most were running west, dragging children and carrying young ones in their arms.
 The men, young and old, took up torches, shortswords, even rakes and sickles, and prepared to defend their homes.

He looked for a key but there was nothing.
 He guessed that it was locked by magic and required a magic word or incantation to open the lock.
 He pushed and pulled on the door, but it was solidly made and there was nothing to get a good hold of to test his new strength.
 He looked around for something to use as a pry bar; next to the fireplace was a poker.
 He grabbed it and forced it into the crack were a normal door would have its catch.
 He got it wedged in good but then stopped and went over to the outside door and opening it, listened for anyone nearby before going back inside the room.
 He carefully closed the door behind him; the sound of him breaking down the study door would ring loud in the predawn silence, but his need for money was too great.
 What he had found would be worth some good coin but finding a trader that would give him its worth would take time.
 He needed to find silver and gold.
 Rodregas muffled the door with a blanket the best he could and then with a violent shove and twist of the fireplace poker, shattered open the study door.

That doesn't explain it all though.
 Neither does the fact that you stepped in and saved Rachel from a beating I couldn't stop."
 He reached up and tucked a stray hair behind my left ear.
 "Whatever the reason, since your arrival here, I just feel like parts of me that were missing have come back home.
 Even when I thought you were some kind of...rogue...shape shifter come to destroy my pack, I was still drawn to you."
 My stupid eyes were tearing up again.
 Sometimes being a girl really sucked.
 Boys never seemed to have their bodies betray them in front of other people like we did.
 The most gorgeous, kind boy I'd ever met had just professed his love to me, and strangely enough it made what I had to do next both harder and easier.
 "Alec, what if I were to go back to Brandon?

‚ÄúI mean before, people always used to assume I had neither brawn nor brains.‚Äù With a smile he added, ‚ÄúWhat do you say?
 Shall the three of us set some time aside to teach each other what we know of magic and see what we can learn from these magic books of Ravenhurr‚Äôs?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúI mean, yes, I would like to learn what you can teach me.
 I like to learn,‚Äù he said slowly but carefully.
 The big guy was embarrassed.
 Then he added, ‚ÄúI am afraid my people are not big readers, and, well, they saw me as half-monster and I never learned how to read.‚Äù The last words he added very slowly, but then quickly added, ‚ÄúBut if you can teach me some basics from the oral techniques that Imeralda mentioned, I would like to learn some magic if I can.‚Äù Rodregas looked at Doi‚Äôvan; there was something about his expression, a yearning.
 ‚ÄúDo you want to learn to read?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan asked, stepping away from the other two like he was uncomfortable.
 ‚ÄúJust what I said, would you like to learn to read?‚Äù Rodregas said in a carefully casual voice.

Rodregas pulled his eyes away from the horrifying vision as the corporal man went from looking confused and unsure to having no expression at all, like an empty piece of meat.
 Rodregas‚Äôs eyes flinched away from the terrible sight as he felt he might scream in horror and fury at what was happening.
 Then Ravenhurr yelled out, ‚ÄúSpirea faira podia turiana,‚Äù and the circle holding the Celestial Lion started to burn in the same blue flames, the blue flames that make up the creation forces of life that can only be called up when the Celestial Realm was close.
 Suddenly the sleeping lion looked up in surprise and started to growl and then he started to burn.
 Rodregas had seen enough of lesser versions of the ritual to expect it, but to watch it was amazing.
 The circle blazed with an intense heat that blasted his face and the magnificent creature inside blazed with blue creation fire.
 It was a sudden and violent and primal process.
 The lion started to stand up and then simply fell apart into blazing blue energy.
 That energy surged out of the circle and swirled around inside the larger outer circle.
 Every hair on Rodregas‚Äô body stood at attention.

It ached.
 I didn‚Äôt want him to hate me.
 Ruby whirled into the room and grabbed me around the waist from behind, spinning me up, over the back of the seat, and through her door before I could process what was happening.
 She plopped me down in the center of her bed and swung around to sit in front of me.
 My head was reeling from the spin as she smiled at me, waving her hands and bringing a plethora of bottles and canisters flying toward us to drop on the bed.
 I thought with disappointment that I hadn‚Äôt responded to her attack as Chevelle had taught me and laughed at the image in my head.
 Ruby gave me a genuine smile as she began twisting the lid on a small metal canister.
 ‚ÄúNo mother to teach us the tricks of the trade,‚Äù she sighed as she leaned in.
 I jerked away from her, wanting to be angry about the comment.
 But Ruby had just told me her own story, no less tragic.

Rachel nodded slowly, her wonderfully expressive face full of sympathy.
 "I'm sorry to have pried like that.
 If I'd known it would make you feel bad, I wouldn't have asked."
 I tried to shrug indifferently, but she seemed to see through my pretenses.
 "I normally wouldn't have said anything, but knowing what I know now, I wouldn't want you to go through the next several days hurting inside because you think everyone looking at you out of the corner of their eye is ridiculing you."
 Confident she didn't really need help, and eager to avoid further reminders of just how broken I was, I'd been standing to return to my desk.
 The words were plenty foreboding, but they had an impact all out of proportion from what they should have.
 I sank back into the chair and turned towards Rachel.
 Not enough to actually make eye contact with her, just enough I hopefully didn't come off rude.
 Maybe the illusion of space would be enough to cushion me from whatever she was going to say next.

Tinkling bells and all that aside, it really did sound like the kind of laugh you'd hear described for the princess of a fairy tale.
 Had I really never heard her laugh before, or was it just that she hadn't ever meant it before?
 "She left about five minutes before James did."
 "Still chatting up her prime candidate for the big dance?"
 Rachel nodded as we skirted the last two tables between us and the one exterior door in the tutor lab.
 "Yep, she's definitely settled on Tim Parsons, who's perfect if you like your men fairly handsome, moderately popular, and built like an ox."
 I wanted to protest, but if anything Rachel was being too kind.
 I'd seen Tim trying to sound out the captions underneath the pictures in Sports Illustrated of his favorite pro football players.
 I was just about to ask who we were going to ride with, more as a way of changing the subject than anything else, when movement off to my right answered the question.
 "Alec!"

I dream of a heaven where Mary, my beloved grandma, can meet my Zo√´.
 She is a blessing of inestimable worth, a beauty with a noble round face and hundreds of expressions, and she‚Äôs strong, with the same broad shoulders and barrel chest as her weight-lifting brother.
 Twice lately I have encountered the same Bible verse, from the prophet Joel.
 "I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophecy, your old men shall dream dreams."
 Zo√´‚Äôs mom, though a little weakened and weary, looks ecstatic as though dancing in a circle of angels, and I am caught up in a love bigger than before.
 I want to cradle my new daughter (very carefully), forever.
 All at once, I want to hold Zo√´, Pam, Darcy, Cody, my cousins, ancestors, descendants.
 God and everybody.
 Me v. God
 As it appears I‚Äôm too attached to the world to live for and with God like Brother Lawrence did, I try to console myself by thinking of one of my favorite writers, Andre Dubus.

I hid myself behind a patch of brush to watch him.
 He had a lovely complexion with a hint of bronze and cropped dark brown hair with a few tiny streaks of blond just around his face.
 He looked less like the others I had been watching.
 He was built like the elves, strong and muscled, but still lean.
 He wore plain pants and tall boots.
 His light cloth shirt moved around him as he walked, unlaced at the chest.
 He carried a small blade in his hand, but I couldn‚Äôt imagine what he was doing here unaccompanied.
 There was a rustle from the brush several yards in the opposite direction I was hiding.
 He rushed toward it and I followed, unsure why he was running.
 The noise was made by a small boar and the human was chasing it.

In my mind not being where you said you were going to be, especially after being so jazzed about it previously, fit into that category.
 Rachel wasn't making a good start.
 "Why don't we cut to the chase, Rachel?
 You didn't go to Les Mis√©rables.
 We spent more than a week planning what we were going to do on the way up and the way back, and you didn't bother to show up."
 Rachel's mouth opened and closed a few times.
 She looked around, but we weren't the only two people in the room.
 James was barely visible pacing up and down the far end of the hall, so there wasn't any help there either.
 "I'm sorry, I really wanted to go.
 More than anything, but I couldn't."

‚ÄúFirst, Geriodon is much disliked.
 He is gruff, unfriendly and too serious to like.
 The squires and knights universally dislike him.
 This is his third attempt to achieve knighthood and he has gotten closer each time.
 While he is the odds on favorite to achieve it this year, no one wants him to win,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúI went and chatted with him,‚Äù she continued ‚Äúand he hates the Immortalists, but is rather unpleasant and needs to take a bath.
 But he is also clearly very honorable.
 And when I asked him why he wanted to be a knight‚Ä¶‚Äù she paused then added, ‚Äúhe said that some ‚ÄòInfernally damned knights‚Äô have to stand up and fight.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo you think he is a good man?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúI think Geriodon is a ‚Äòholier than thou‚Äô stick in the mud, who needs to learn to bathe and not mumble when he speaks.
 And yes, he is probably one of the only men here that actually deserves knighthood.‚Äù Rodregas nodded and said, ‚ÄúWhat about Nordien?‚Äù ‚ÄúNordien is the polar opposite to Geriodon; smooth and friendly‚Ä¶ and tried to have sex with me within our first conversation, which was also the only decent thing he said during our conversation.

I tried not to radiate too much contentment, but rather suspected I failed.
 Vincent wasn't really driving any faster than before, but the fact that we were going up and down slopes I wouldn't have thought could be driven made his current speed reckless.
 Even with Brandon's arm stopping me from flying out of the pickup, I still had a couple of moments where my heart shot up to the top of my throat.
 He of course remained frustratingly calm, even when we hit a bump with enough force to nearly send everyone flying out of the bed.
 The other girls were trying hard to appear nonplussed.
 They were probably even fooling the boys, but they weren't enjoying themselves.
 I was nearly sick by the time the track we were following leveled out, but there was just enough light left for me to enjoy the last of the sunset as we finished up the last ten minutes of the drive.
 As the final glimmers of color faded away into twilight, Vincent pulled his truck over in a spray of dust, and we were there.
 I'd been expecting a lot of people.
 Even I knew you couldn't finish off two kegs of beer with eight or nine people, but this was crazy.

Maybe one or two will be okay once I've touched them up, but this brochure is proving tougher than expected.
 Can we talk after dinner?"
 By now I really should have been used to Mom ignoring me when she got buried in a project.
 I shrugged and went upstairs to change.
 Hours later, having finished up all my homework and endured the agony of dinner, I was finally free to do whatever I wanted with the last few minutes of my night.
 My room was still miserable, but with Mom sitting down in the living room with her laptop going through the gigs of data that she'd shot over the last few days, it offered the only real chance at some time alone.
 I trudged up the stairs, shut my door, and then realized I wasn't sure what to do with myself.
 I'd spent most of the time since we'd arrived either buried in homework, or borderline catatonic.
 The obvious choice was sitting on the rickety table next to my bed, but I wasn't sure if I was up to Les Mis√©rables right now.
 Maybe in a few weeks, once the production had left Vegas, I'd be ready to delve back into it.

The main prerequisite and condition for the fulfilment of the world‚Äôs many different potentials is peace.
 As democracy supports peaceful relations between states, economic prosperity and fuller development of people, peace makes possible the development of stable political institutions, more productive economic activity and a more civilized and enlightened social life.
 Without establishing a stable climate of peace, human rights cannot be safeguarded, democratic institutions cannot function effectively, prosperity cannot flourish, and human beings cannot discover their higher capacities for external achievement and inner fulfilment.
 Peace is imperative for a thriving democracy.
 A comprehensive perspective and integrated approach to these inter-related issues can lead to a major breakthrough on multiple fronts.
 We are poised at what can become a turning point in the role of war in human affairs.
 The momentous consequences at stake call for decisive action.
 Historically, war has been a means of territorial expansion and economic conquest that strengthened and enriched the conqueror while draining the energy and diminishing the wealth of the conquered.
 War and economic development co-existed and sometimes complemented each other.
 Technological progress increased defensive and offensive capabilities.

I don't understand.
 You're right, I don't.
 I would've done almost anything to protect my sister, but you didn't even care that Rachel was going to get hurt."
 Now I really was scared, Alec was trembling slightly, and he looked like he wanted to slap me.
 While I was still trying to decide whether I should radiate smugness at having verbally bested him, or run back to the safety of the tutor room, he lunged forward and grabbed me around the shoulders.
 "I was going to offer you my protection against Cassie and Brandon, and you throw your supposed superiority in my face.
 Fine, but don't come crying back to me when the mask comes off."
 Alec abruptly released me and stalked off.
 He was moving so incredibly quickly he'd disappeared around a corner with one balled-up fist pressed against his side before I'd even started shaking in fear.
 I'd never before been that helpless.

From the feeling of the air I knew we weren't underground anymore but I didn't know where we were.
 Skeleton trees were scattered to the sides.
 There were long hills ahead, the grass a light gray.
 ‚ÄúThis place looks like it‚Äôs from a book about hell,‚Äù Seth said.
 ‚ÄúWhere are we now?‚Äù I asked.
 He shook his head.
 ‚ÄúDo we ever know where we are?‚Äù I shook my head and he sighed.
 ‚ÄúExactly, we never do.
 You really got to stop asking that question.‚Äù He started to hike the hill.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äòre trying to find out.‚Äù I walked up behind him, my leg muscles cramping.

‚ÄúMove, before the meat spoils,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 The big half-orc stepped out of the way.
 Qurrah came through, carrying a slab of meat in his hands.
 He weaved across the missing planks in the floor and sat next to a small circle of stones.
 Above him was a hole in the ceiling for the smoke to escape.
 ‚ÄúSince when has spoiling meat stopped me from eating it?‚Äù Harruq asked.
 Qurrah laughed.
 ‚ÄúWhich explains so much.‚Äù
 Murmuring a few words, he smashed his hands together.
 Fire burst to life in the center of the stones.

Granted that a consensus is reached regarding these larger issues of principle, there still will remain immense problems relating to implementation, as illustrated by the recent failure of international intervention in Somalia.
 Whatever may be the limits placed on the UN‚Äôs mandate for action, it is clear that it cannot carry out that mandate effectively under the current constraints imposed on it by member states through indecisiveness, narrowly defined interests and lack of political commitment.
 Once again the inherent weaknesses in the structure of the UN organization impact negatively on its capacity to perform the tasks rightfully allotted to it.
 The absence of a unified chain of command for national forces placed under UN command ‚Äì culminating in the outright refusal of field forces to follow the commands of UN field staff, inadequate training and equipping of both military staff and fighting units, poor coordination between field units from different countries and between member states and UN headquarters ‚Äì and a failure to vest sufficient authority in the UN Secretary General are among the most blatant weaknesses of the present system.
 Substantive measures are needed to strengthen the UN‚Äôs capabilities to handle crises.
 First and foremost, the position of the Secretary General, who now has the diplomatic status equal to that of a prime minister of a member state, should be upgraded to that of a head of state, with full authority over the forces placed under his command by member states to carry out the decisions of the Security Council.
 Problems of control over the armed forces of member states argue for the constitution of a standing international military force, as described in the previous section of this report.
 Lesser measures can be implemented immediately, such as provision of appropriate training to UN Secretariat personnel responsible for conflict prevention, expanding the staff of the Department of Political Affairs, and establishment by the UN of its own independent international surveillance capability, including a satellite system to monitor its work worldwide.
 Meanwhile, advanced computer, satellite and communications technology should be made available to the Secretariat by member states.
 A comprehensive system is needed to monitor military movements.

Beyond her, a line of long flowing robes marched through the mist‚Ä¶ coming for us.
 The sight gave me strength, or courage, or blinding stupidity.
 I didn‚Äôt know, but I went with it with everything I had.
 I was trapped against the wall, unable to move, but there was one thing I could do.
 The sun broke through the clouds and I saw precisely what I needed.
 A shadow crossed the ground in front of us, a hawk flying overhead.
 The corner of my mouth pulled up in a smile as I closed my eyes to join him.
 The scene from above was just as incomprehensible.
 I focused on one thing at a time.
 Directly below me, I saw Grey.

Alec was gone when I looked back.
 Only the slight sway of my curtains gave evidence he'd just casually jumped out of my second-story window.
 I heard Mom's equipment bags hit the floor one after another.
 The sound of her tromping up the stairs finally roused me from my state of shock.
 "I'm in my room, Mom."
 Apparently the sound of my voice was at least slightly reassuring, she was only a little wild-eyed by the time she opened the door and stuck her head in my room.
 "Oh, there you are, dear.
 I was worried you were gone."
 I forced a chuckle.
 "Please, Mom.

I've been in politics longer than you've been alive, and it takes a whole hell of a lot more than a precocious teenager to blackmail me.
 So, you can just drop your veiled threats and pretend like we never had this conversation, or I¬†will¬†see that your mom is once again unemployed, and we'll just see whether or not your protector is bluffing."
 Stepping out of my front door and being hit by a cement truck would have been less of a surprise.
 I'd thought something odd was happening, but the idea of someone protecting us was almost unbelievable.
 The mayor took my shock as a sign he once again had the upper hand.
 Smiling smugly, he turned to leave, but not before I could grab at the sleeve of his sport coat.
 "Wait.
 Who is it?
 Who's helping us?"
 The smirk hadn't left.

And the Cliffs of Insanity, well, no.
 Jim - What happens to be wrong with the Cliffs of Insanity?
 Art ‚Äì Nothing, they‚Äôre just not really all that deadly.
 I mean what a misnomer, they‚Äôre only five feet high at their tallest, and for the most part they only stand two or three feet in height.
 And then they don‚Äôt exactly qualify as cliffs with their gentle incline and all.
 I wonder what idiot was allowed to name them cliffs in the first place, Don Quixote?
 Jim ‚Äì They‚Äôre the best we have.

 Torn Excerpt The silvery light of a nearly-full moon should have been comforting.
 For most people it would've been peaceful even, but it pulled at my anger with surprising strength as I bounded across the arid Southern-Utah terrain.
 Darkly-furred, four-legged shapes ghosted through the darkness on either side of me as we slid between the softly-glowing pillars of trees.
 Jasmin, arguably the closest thing I had to a best friend, dove through a latticework of light and then it was my turn to feel the undergrowth grasping at my fur in an effort to slow my progress.
 The warm evening breeze carried a host of aromas too subtle for mere human noses to identify.
 In our four-footed forms each molecule was unconsciously sorted and cataloged, leaving us free to concentrate on the elusive scent of our prey.
 The other pack, a portion at least, was less than a mile away, far enough into our territory for it to be a killable offense if they were caught.

 Then instead of leaving they started singing hymns praising God and Jesus and stuff.

Brandon was still smiling, but I got the feeling that it was a little more forced.
 "Perfect.

 Mrs. Campbell looked up from the plant she was watering as we walked into the tutoring room.
 "Ah, there you two are.
 Britney, you'll be sitting over there from now on.
 Adriana, go ahead and get started on your homework.
 When you finish come find me and we'll get you situated."
 As always, Rachel was sitting at her table in the middle of no-man's-land.
 She looked up at me and smiled as I took my usual spot and started on my homework.

He vomited until he had nothing left.
 He curled up in the fetal position, chanting inaudible ramblings and contorting to the point that we had to pad the doorframe and cabinets with towels to keep him from banging his head and limbs.
 In the twelfth hour of fetal position rocking, infantile whimpering, sickening dry heaves and panicked breathing, I broke out my video camera, thinking I‚Äôd just tape a reminder: He can‚Äôt possibly ever want to do this again.
 His mother on the bathroom floor alongside him, cushioning his head before it smacks the doorframe, stroking his back and newly shorn hair.
 I am defined again by this moment, disgusted by myself, but in a warped way triumphant: You see, you see you little shit‚Äî what happens when you don‚Äôt listen to me?
 He was a walking skeleton and you could see his every rib.
 The bones on his spine looked like a row of knots stretched under his skin.
 His pelvic bones stuck out reminiscent of a dead animal‚Äôs carcass on the roadside.
 He looked like one of the horrid pictures you see of a concentration camp victim.

They had been monitoring him for some time and had ample surveillance to make up for the lack of drugs at his actual bust.
 Brandon had been dealing Oxy for the past few years and the police had been looking to get him.
 Brandon had at one time been moving thousands of these tiny green prescription pain pills through California, making nighttime drives to Los Angeles and back to buy huge quantities to supply the Sacramento area.
 They were charging him with three felonies and he was facing five plus years in prison.
 Faced with the charges, Brandon waved his attorney rights and talked too much‚Äî a strung out drug addict who just got popped.
 The interrogation lasted nearly twenty hours; although, to Brandon, it felt like three days.
 Faced with the abundance of evidence and the thought of five years in prison, Brandon broke and agreed to bust a dealer named Steve.
 The interesting thing about Steve was that much of the information the officers had on Brandon was from Steve.
 It‚Äôs quite a tangled web.
 Steve had been busted some time ago and released when he agreed to work with the narcotics division of the police department.

A tiny pebble lay on the ground at my feet.
 I focused on it hard, willing it to rise.
 When nothing happened I looked for Chevelle‚Äôs reaction.
 He watched me, his serene mask back in place.
 ‚ÄúDo you need motivation?‚Äù I was afraid of the kind of motivation he‚Äôd provide, remembering the fireballs flying at me in the meadow.
 ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù My answer was too quick, and he laughed.
 I knelt closer to the gray rock.
 I thought it moved a little, as if trembling in fright, and the notion had me shaking my head.
 Chevelle stood.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trying too hard, Freya.

He knew Captain Poir would probably do one of two things: either come after him immediately or head to the Celestial Path Guild Hall in the capital.
 If Captain Poir headed immediately for the Guild Hall to report the strange happening, it would give him more time to find a place to lie low.
 However, it would be better for him if Poir went looking for Rodregas himself instead, and spread his men all over trying to find him.
 There were only about twenty Ravenhurr guardsmen.
 If they were sent in every possible direction, especially in pairs, there was a good chance that he would come across no more than two of them at a time.
 If they were still confused about whether he was or was not Ravenhurr, he would have an excellent chance of overcoming them.
 On the other hand, if the forces of the guild came after him‚Ä¶ The guardsmen of the Immortalist guild were known as the Immortal Guards and their reputation as the premier fighters of the realm was seldom questioned.
 If they found out what had happened at Raven Keep there was not much chance for Rodregas‚Äô survival.
 After a simple meal, a good rub down for the horses and a few hours of rest, Rodregas got the wagon back on the road.
 If he could keep up this pace, up he could be well hidden before any forces could find him.

She is a blessing of inestimable worth, a beauty with a noble round face and hundreds of expressions, and she‚Äôs strong, with the same broad shoulders and barrel chest as her weight-lifting brother.
 Twice lately I have encountered the same Bible verse, from the prophet Joel.
 "I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophecy, your old men shall dream dreams."
 Zo√´‚Äôs mom, though a little weakened and weary, looks ecstatic as though dancing in a circle of angels, and I am caught up in a love bigger than before.
 I want to cradle my new daughter (very carefully), forever.
 All at once, I want to hold Zo√´, Pam, Darcy, Cody, my cousins, ancestors, descendants.
 God and everybody.

 As it appears I‚Äôm too attached to the world to live for and with God like Brother Lawrence did, I try to console myself by thinking of one of my favorite writers, Andre Dubus.
 In ‚ÄúA Father‚Äôs Story‚Äù, he tells about Luke, a horse breeder who attempts to live in God‚Äôs will yet finds himself needing to choose between what he believes is right in God‚Äôs eyes and his daughter‚Äôs well-being.

Chevelle helped me to my feet and I walked, a little wobbly, to the door.
 I had been dressed in a vest of dark leather and slim pants, carved medallions adorning my chest, but my feet were bare as they crossed the polished stone floor of the bedroom, at ease in a place they seemed to know.
 I stepped out into the sun, and I had to steady myself on the stone ledge.
 Not because of the lightheadedness, though I was feeling faint, but because below me, before the steps to what I now realized was a castle, a thousand elves watched me.
 I sucked in a harsh breath, unable to get my mind to accept what I knew was happening.
 I had been so oblivious.
 Reading the diary, learning of my mother and her ties to the throne.
 It had told of my own life, of what I was to become, a reality that would not be put to rights in my broken mind.
 But as I stared down, the assembled pieces of my shattered self held together by no more than tattered bits of string, I understood.
 This was my place.

This has resulted in a marked decline in investment by developing countries in government-sponsored agricultural research and rural techno-infrastructure.
 This tendency has been compounded by the false notion that in order to achieve economic growth, new jobs must be created in industry and services.
 Economic policy
 The resurgence of faith in the free market and liberalized trade has placed developing countries under increasing pressure from donors and international financial institutions to abandon special types of economic assistance to the agricultural sector in the form of subsidies for supply of critical inputs such as fertilizer and seeds and price supports for marketable crops.
 This pressure has recently been aggravated by the impact of structural adjustment programmes that usually involve drastic reduction in government subsidies.
 In Ghana, for instance, the cost of fertilizer as a percentage of total cultivation cost has risen ten-fold in recent years.
 The impact of macro-economic reforms on agriculture has been most severe in the countries of Eastern and Central Europe, where production in this sector has fallen drastically over the past few years.
 Technology
 Slower growth in productivity can be attributed to a slowdown in the development of improved hybrid varieties, shortages of quality seeds and fertilizers, and the absence of techno-infrastructure facilities needed for storage and processing, expansion of markets, transport and distribution.

I fell back in amazement as he stepped into the pool of light that'd materialized as the clouds parted.
 The jeans were mundane, perfect, but completely normal for all that they were snug in all the right places and loose everywhere else.
 The shirt, unbuttoned in his haste to follow me, was also perfectly normal, entirely believable.
 Everything else, however, was too surreal to really grasp.
 The sculpted stomach and chest were exactly like I'd secretly imagined they would be, but my gaze was pulled instead up to the massive bandage covering most of Alec's shoulder.
 The bandage alone should have told me I hadn't been hallucinating, but the fragments of memory didn't coalesce until I saw his eyes.
 The amazing, pale blue eyes were the final, poetic piece of evidence threatening to shred my sanity.
 I'd never really liked Alec, but I never suspected he was an actual monster.
 It was too much to process so quickly.
 When Alec took a careful step towards me, all I could think of was that I'd just seen those same eyes hovering above bloodstained fangs.

Rodregas nodded and said, ‚ÄúI am afraid other than a few items to sell everything else is food and blankets for us... and the horses and tools that I stripped out of the Raven Keep.
 I figured I would need the tools to fix this place up and make it livable.‚Äù Rodregas continued, ‚ÄúIt is dark and late.
 Let‚Äôs make camp in here.
 In the morning we can start seeing about getting this farm in order.‚Äù With that they all worked together to get the barn organized and clean.
 There was no more talking, each had plenty of their own thoughts to mull over.
 Rodregas was feeling pretty good at the moment, dangerously positive.
 He had learned long ago that the better you felt, the harder came the emotional fall.
 He knew this was all too good to last, but knowing that it would not last also made it more important that he enjoy the moment.
 Rodregas was free.

Skippy loved it when I‚Äôd bring a new song in‚Äîwe practiced at his house‚Äîhe had this garage and we covered the old sticky walls with egg cartons.
 Our own little studio.
 Skippy was beautiful, man.
 Full of praise for whatever I wanted to do with the band.
 Not like a sycophant, you know, a toady.
 He just was enthusiastic and every artist needs someone like that.
 I know I do, even today, even now, and it‚Äôs Lor, of course.
 She‚Äôs my star.

So let‚Äôs just add this accident to my list, okay?‚Äù I said quickly before the two started something.
 They nodded but shot each other smirks.
 I sighed, wondering why those two buffoons had been granted this power along, with Emily and me.
 It‚Äôs not like they weren‚Äôt foolish enough already.
 The day when it all changed was still a mystery to us.
 A lot of things happened that didn‚Äôt quite make sense.
 The four of us were already best friends.
 We were walking through the woods, rambling on about how Halloween was almost here and that Ms. Stecher was still giving us too much homework.
 Then all of a sudden an invisible object slammed into me.
 I shrieked and couldn‚Äôt move.

Alec's mom was tiny.
 It was easy to see where Rachel got her slight frame from, but there was more than just genetics at work.
 I'd never seen someone with so little extra flesh on their bones, at least not outside a hospital.
 It seemed she should be wearing a hospital gown instead of the white, flower-print summer dress I was almost sure cost more than my whole wardrobe.
 "We're experiencing a time of more than usual difficulty, Mother, but that isn't why I've come by.
 I wanted to present my friend Adriana to you.
 She'll be staying with us for the next few weeks."
 I got a distracted smile.
 "That's nice, dear.
 You remind me so much of your father.

They are probably going to stop at Stallion‚Äôs Perch.‚Äù After much debate between the three of them Stallion‚Äôs Perch was their destination, a small keep that was known to breed Dire horses for the Immortal Guard.
 ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt,‚Äù responded Imeralda with a whisper.
 ‚ÄúThey are traveling with a patrol of Immortal guards.
 I think there are only four, but scout patrols often have a warrior with a minor sigil of enhanced senses.
 He might spot us.‚Äù As she spoke Rodregas noticed that Imeralda had a strange expression on her face, she was scared, but also seemed sad.
 ‚ÄúWhat kind of slaves do they have?‚Äù Rodregas asked in a gentle voice.
 Her body jerked more directly toward him, surprise covering her sad expression for a second.
 ‚ÄúMixed, of course, human, AElfin.
 But, Rodregas, they have Forest and Earth Nymphs and several are children.
 I was raised among AElfin, but these are my people.

‚ÄúNow,‚Äù he said and quickly repeated in his deep but smooth voice, ‚ÄúNOW!‚Äù Captain Poir, the leader of Ravenhurr‚Äôs guards, had stepped out of the shadows and approached the prisoners, but Rodregas stepped forward first and grabbed the half AElf maiden‚Äôs arm.
 With a quick twist of the key he removed her iron shackles but grabbed her arm hard so she could not run.
 ‚ÄúThis way,‚Äù Rodregas said to her.
 As he separated her from the male prisoner he whispered to her, ‚ÄúIf you want to live, don‚Äôt do anything until your circle starts to burn, then I will throw the club at the other guard.
 Run and make sure you get out of the circle.‚Äù She jerked towards him as he spoke and Rodregas was struck once again by the beauty of her amazing eyes, but he forced her forward hoping that she could think on her feet.
 Rodregas carefully led her over the outer white circle and into a yellow circle that was across from the Celestial Lion.
 Captain Poir led the man into the pale green circle that was the closest to being in the exact middle and was most strongly interconnected to the other circles.
 As Rodregas crossed into the main circle, the sense of power almost made him stumble.
 He knew his own power was minimal, not much above average, but his few years of training as a boy had opened him up to magic more than the other three guards on the tower roof.
 Rodregas knew that if Ravenhurr had ever thought he had more than basic magic training he would long have been reassigned to a duty far from the ceremony.

My eyes squinted open as I resisted the urge to stop the birds.
 It was the first time I‚Äôd slept away from my bed; disoriented, I glanced around.
 It didn‚Äôt help.
 I‚Äôd never been far from home and the new landscape was unsettling.
 But when I looked away, I noticed the neatly stacked pile of fabric and loaf of bread that had been positioned beside me.
 I silently cursed the watchers who had apparently found me during the night.
 I didn‚Äôt see them anywhere, so I assumed they‚Äôd left me out here as punishment.
 Some part of me wanted to burn the pile for spite, but my stomach overruled the thought.
 Reaching out to grab the bread, and then, since I had already defied my belligerence, the stack of clothes, I stood to find a creek to clean up and finally get out of this ridiculous dress.
 It took a moment to locate the trickle of water, but the creek was only a short distance away.

We could tell their feelings were hurt, but we didn‚Äôt feel we had any other choice.
 We did allow my younger brother Harry in on the whole awful situation and invited him to come to the house as planned.
 I needed my younger brother because he had developed a great relationship with my boys.
 He‚Äôs 11 years younger than me, and in the music business where he works shooting videos for rap artists my sons listen to.
 He has had a solid relationship with both of our boys and that could translate into communication.
 This Thanksgiving we had an agenda that didn‚Äôt include turkey and all the trimmings.
 Agenda Item One: Get our son‚Äôs belongings out of his rental house.
 The landlord met me, Lisa, Harry, Harry‚Äôs wife Anabel, and a shaking miserable Brandon at the house, and I felt sorry for the owner of this home.
 He was a deeply religious man accompanied by his mousy wife and perfectly groomed daughter, all dressed in their Sunday best on their way home from church.
 He had believed all of Brandon‚Äôs lies, trusted my son and his roommates and ended up landlord of a drug den.

‚ÄúNo need for lies,‚Äù he said.
 The elf laughed a little but said nothing.
 Instead, she walked over and gave Harruq a quick peck on the cheek.
 ‚ÄúKeep your big butt safe, okay?‚Äù she said.
 The half-orc tried to answer but his mouth refused to cooperate.
 Somehow, it seemed to have become unhinged.
 Besides, it wasn‚Äôt as if he could think of anything to say.
 All his mind could concentrate on was the feel of the elf‚Äôs soft lips on his cheek, the flowery scent of her perfume mixed with sweat, and the quick brush of her breasts against his arm.
 By the time his jaw and mind began working again, Aurelia was laughing.
 ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so funny?‚Äù he demanded.

It makes me cringe to merely think of it.
 The elders were there, though.
 My father and the others waited in the throne room, arranging a celebration.
 I had read everything I could obtain on the process during my pregnancy and imprisonment in the castle, even finding a few books and scrolls on humans.
 But nothing prepared me for what happened.
 I had been walking when the pain struck‚Äîpacing my room with worry, if I were truthful.
 It hit suddenly, a stabbing, ripping, horrible thing.
 My screams called everyone to order, but then it subsided.
 However, it was only long enough to catch my breath and then it was back tenfold.
 I writhed in agony.

Thomas would drag out a ‚Äúrock‚Äù of cocaine from the massive pile and crack it open as if he was cutting a diamond.
 The story of its origin and quality were described as if you were listening to a reading from a science fiction novelist.
 To watch these people hang on every word of his bullshit was sickening to me.
 Their wild eyes and grinding jaws were just the physical part of their bizarre behavior.
 People would hover next to windows, peeking out every few seconds, check the locks on the same doors over and over again as their paranoia increased with every line they snorted.
 There was no deterring Thomas from his occupation, as he believed himself invincible‚Äîas all drug dealers do.
 I had watched other old friends get hauled off to jail and I didn‚Äôt want the same for my brother.
 One afternoon, I called Thomas and a strange voice picked up the phone.
 I asked for Thomas and the person on the phone said, ‚ÄúHe is unavailable right now, but tell me what you want and I will get it ready for you to pick up.‚Äù It was obviously a cop, and I knew my brother was probably sitting there in handcuffs while they set up every idiot who called for drugs, then collected them like goldfish as they swam into the net.
 I called my mother and told her I thought Thomas had been busted; time would confirm he had.

Acceptance must be fostered through education and discussion rather than unilateral forced initiative.
 Preventive Diplomacy, Peace Making and Peace Building
 The answers to the questions regarding national sovereignty and international responsibility will determine the scope of UN preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace building in years to come.
 They must be addressed with a view to evolving valid principles of international law, rather than remaining subject to frequent reversals of public policy by member states based on the short-term impact of the media on current public opinion.
 Granted that a consensus is reached regarding these larger issues of principle, there still will remain immense problems relating to implementation, as illustrated by the recent failure of international intervention in Somalia.
 Whatever may be the limits placed on the UN‚Äôs mandate for action, it is clear that it cannot carry out that mandate effectively under the current constraints imposed on it by member states through indecisiveness, narrowly defined interests and lack of political commitment.
 Once again the inherent weaknesses in the structure of the UN organization impact negatively on its capacity to perform the tasks rightfully allotted to it.
 The absence of a unified chain of command for national forces placed under UN command ‚Äì culminating in the outright refusal of field forces to follow the commands of UN field staff, inadequate training and equipping of both military staff and fighting units, poor coordination between field units from different countries and between member states and UN headquarters ‚Äì and a failure to vest sufficient authority in the UN Secretary General are among the most blatant weaknesses of the present system.
 Substantive measures are needed to strengthen the UN‚Äôs capabilities to handle crises.
 First and foremost, the position of the Secretary General, who now has the diplomatic status equal to that of a prime minister of a member state, should be upgraded to that of a head of state, with full authority over the forces placed under his command by member states to carry out the decisions of the Security Council.

She sighed.
 ‚ÄúOkay, but you‚Äôll probably regret it.‚Äù ‚ÄúJust give her the short version, Ruby,‚Äù Steed interrupted.
 ‚ÄúNo gory details.‚Äù His eyebrow cocked meaningfully.
 ‚ÄúOh, well, yes, that would do.‚Äù She smiled at me as she licked another arrow, tongue sliding carefully along the blade.
 ‚ÄúYou see, my dear, being a one of a kind‚Äîwell, as far as I know‚Äîhas its benefits.
 Though they weren‚Äôt always benefits.
 Ooh, in the beginning it was bad‚Ä¶ but, well, that‚Äôs the long version, isn‚Äôt it?
 No gory details.‚Äù She winked at Steed.
 ‚ÄúI am, how should I put it‚Ä¶ venomous.‚Äù I gasped.
 It was her expected response.

I felt marginalized, like we were from this backwater town and everything was happening elsewhere, like you know, how everybody in Memphis feels about New York, or it was San Francisco for a while.
 That inferiority thing.

 I mean, everybody wants to know if I know Elvis, you know.
 Everybody asks me that, everybody even in the business.
 He‚Äôs revered, and that‚Äôs right, that‚Äôs right.
 But, I mean, even McCartney wanted to know if I‚Äôd ever met Elvis once he heard I was from Memphis.
 I wanted to say, man, Memphis is more than Elvis, as great as he was.
 Of course, the truth is, I did meet him.
 Once.

I laid face down and she didn‚Äôt offer anything to cover me up as you would in a traditional massage.
 She straddled my buttocks and began to massage my back.
 She told me that she didn‚Äôt have sex as part of her massage.
 I assured her that I just wanted a massage from a pretty young lady and I had no other motive.
 I repeated that I often got massaged from the same older woman and I thought it would be a treat to get a massage from a beautiful young one.
 As I lay there, I could see her in the mirror and we talked from this reflection.
 She pressed the issue of buying the pills.
 She climbed off of me and stood up next to the bed between me and the mirror.
 She looked at me as she slowly pulled her sweat pants off exposing a stunning young body and sleek thong underwear.
 She tugged slightly at her thong to adjust it as she looked over her shoulder in the mirror and checked herself out.

I lose sight of them, as they seem to be going towards the opposite end of the parking lot.
 I assume they will pull around after checking out the surroundings but instead my crack-berry rings within seconds.
 It is Ashley and she is trying to move me to a Starbucks that is on the other side of the same parking lot.
 I resist and ask her if that was her that stopped next to me in the red Dodge Charger.
 She says it was but she would rather meet at the Starbucks where there are some people around.
 I tell her to just come to my truck and let‚Äôs get this deal done.
 Ashley states she is suspicious that I won‚Äôt drive a hundred yards to meet her.
 I make a judgment call that I know will not make the undercover narcotics team happy but she is right, what is my great reason justifying not driving a short distance?
 I tell her I will drive right over and park by the Starbucks.
 I hang up with her and I state into my wire that we are moving to the Starbucks and to deal with it.

 His heart pounded as he ran toward the waves.
 He hoped she had enough sense not to go out very far.
 Just as he ran into the surf, he heard a familiar laugh.

 She threw it to one of three--no, four--guys surrounding her.
 "Marie!"
 She turned to wave to him.
 "Hi, Rick!

Whatever was there had run away because of the attack, and recently.
 I questioned my sister again‚Äîshe‚Äôd had some time to cool down‚Äîbut she was no help.
 I immediately knew she had not even considered that whatever she had been so interested in was still out here, probably close.
 I didn‚Äôt clue her in.
 After a little more time there, I acted as if I‚Äôd lost interest and headed home.
 Tomorrow, I will follow the tracks.
 I will find whoever was there and solve the mystery of their rudimentary tools and strange huts.
 I yawned.
 After a quick glance around, I slid the book back into my pack.
 I rolled over and fell asleep listening to Ruby‚Äôs quiet tune.

She hoped they died instantly, but she knew better.
 They had suffered tremendously.
 ‚ÄúYou monster,‚Äù she shouted.
 ‚ÄúWhat meaning does this battle hold to you?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúEverything,‚Äù Velixar shouted, hurling a flaming ball of fire from each hand.
 ‚ÄúI desire panic and bloodshed all across the east!‚Äù
 Aurelia summoned a magical shield about her body.
 The fireballs thudded three feet from her body and detonated.
 The two nearest buildings crumpled, their walls and roofs blown back by the power.
 The elf winced, nearly knocked to her knees by the force.

The twins used to joke that Buddy played for scrimption and blow jobs.
 This has some truth to it‚Äîthe money wasn‚Äôt great in those days, asking for more money seen as bourgeois or worse‚Äîbut the women were wonderful.
 Buddy, though, let it be said, played for one pure reason in those halcyon days.
 He played for the rush, for the approach to the godhead.
 It was religion to Buddy.
 He sought the perfect note, the one that would bring about rapture.
 One night, after a triple billing at the Shell (Black Lung was the middle act that night, sandwiched between the lesser talents of Rubdown and Barry and the White Panthers), Buddy wandered backstage after his set, still in that trance he seemed to enter when he played, and was greeted by a statuesque blond with eyes the color of the Wolf River at Sunset.
 She stepped into his path like a gunfighter.
 Buddy looked deeply into her.
 She was an equation he could not quite decipher.

The place was about as messy as he had ever seen it; the normal tidiness demanded by Captain Poir had apparently been put aside in excitement over the chance to take some time off for the celebration.
 His personal bunk and trunk were a mess.
 His good blanket was missing, as was his spare pair of boots and most of his other belongings.
 Clearly, the rest of the guards had thought him dead and made free with his stuff.
 Rodregas reached into the trunk but all that was left in there were a few bits of trash, a few candle stubs, some scraps of paper and a bit of cloth.
 He reached down and picked up the small piece of cloth and held it up.
 He stared for some time at the design sewn into it, and then stuck it into his outer purse.
 He had a strong urge to clean up his bunk and leave the area in the order it deserved, but that would be too big of a hint of what had happened.
 So, he was careful to leave it as it was; the longer they thought he was Ravenhurr the better.
 He then walked past the rest of the wooden cots of the barracks to the back where the captain‚Äôs room was.

"Mallory, I'd like to introduce you to Adriana Paige.
 Adriana, Mallory."
 I smiled, and gingerly offered my hand to her, which she clasped in both of hers.
 "I'm very happy to finally get to meet you, young lady.
 Alec is better company than most, but it's nice to have a new face around here."
 I felt myself warming to her immediately, even more so as she ushered us into her small sitting room and clucked over me, all the while proclaiming that I was far too skinny.
 It was exactly the kind of thing you'd expect your grandma to say, but I almost believed her.
 Alec helped both of us down into our chairs, and then smiled as Mallory waved him off.
 "You go ahead and do your chores.
 We girls will just get to know each other, and then once you're done, you can bring me up to speed on the latest developments."

It would do little good to get caught up in a one-on-one battle; the odds were too many against them.
 He had to use his new strength and speed and go after multiple targets.
 Rodregas focused on his breathing, he needed his body ready.
 He rested his body against the tree, trying not to tense up, and breathed deep and slow.
 Quicker than he thought, Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs black bow came up and he started to shoot.
 The Black Yew bows were an incredible advantage, they had been the pride of Raven Keep and were among the most dangerous and rare weapons that the Nymphs used to protect themselves.
 Those bows had primarily been ornamental trophies for Ravenhurr; Rodregas thought that they symbolized a previous victory.
 Only a few of the guards would have had the power to use them and Ravenhurr kept guards with even small power away from the keep.
 Against the leather armor of the slavers there would be no defense, even if they had shields; the arrows would likely blast through anything they had.
 Of course, against the Immortalist guards it was a different matter; their armor would stop the arrows.

The events in Eastern Europe have been widely hailed as a victory for democratic capitalism over authoritarian communism.
 The obvious failure of the latter has been used to support the claim of the former to be the sole political and economic heir to the next millennium.
 This view has been applied to justify the imposition of radical shock therapy on the unsuspecting and unprepared populations of Eastern Europe and stringent structural adjustment programmes on many developing countries.
 But the claim itself is based on a limited and superficial interpretation of history.
 The fall of the Berlin Wall marks the end of a confrontation between two divergent systems that have been struggling toward reconciliation throughout the present century ‚Äì one based on the human right to freedom and the determinism of the free market, the other based on the right to basic economic security and the determinism of the state.
 One has made people subservient to the needs of the state, the other has left them subject to the whims of the market.
 True communism has never existed.
 What lived and has finally died in Eastern Europe is not communism, but statism, the domination of the state and use of state authority to govern the life of the nation, in practice reducing people to forced labour.
 True capitalism, which regards people as a factor of production, passed away more than half a century ago, when the challenge of communism prompted Western societies to incorporate socialist principles and measures to mitigate the blind justice of the free market.
 There are no true capitalist societies in the world.

We were outside the stone walls of the fortress finding sparse greens to eat, which bored me even in a dream.
 I encouraged the horse to run and he responded immediately, taking flight down the mountainside.
 The rocks streaked past us as we ran faster and faster, the wind whipping his mane.
 A great bird perched on the dead limb of an ironwood tree and I jumped to it just as it dropped from the branch and flared its wings out to catch the wind.
 We flew still farther as I watched the mountain pass below.
 There was a scrubby patch of trees ahead and I could see movement there, inside.
 I tried to focus on it‚Ä¶ familiar silver and white.
 Commotion brought me back and I sat up, startled.
 My head spun.
 Ruby caught my arm to steady me.

I tried to judge by appearance who might be winning.
 Chevelle‚Äôs jaw was set, eyes dark.
 Steed flinched, but I had no idea if it was pain or magic.
 The only thing I was sure of was that neither intended to lose.
 Their stances, right down to their gazes, were absolutely unwavering.
 A sound behind me drew attention to how quiet the valley had grown as we watched this unanimated brawl.
 And in an instant, how still.
 Steed and Chevelle broke their stare, turning to the noise‚Äîdogs, I thought‚Äîbefore the entire world shifted into action.
 Ruby was gone, vanished from beside me, and I was whisked from my seat, catching only a glimpse of Steed and Chevelle darting past.
 In less than a heartbeat, I was standing over the rocks in the opposite direction, Ruby before me, red curls blocking my view, arms outstretched in readiness.

Why had I expected more from him?
 He was my watcher.
 He‚Äôd volunteered to help council bind me.
 But it didn‚Äôt stop the hostile stare I was sending his way.
 Ruby stepped in front of him.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stay with her.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt reply; he merely turned from her to walk into the haze.
 I was still fuming when she faced me, wearing a self-satisfied smile.
 She practically danced forward to plop down in front of me.
 ‚ÄúI have something for you, Frey.‚Äù I simply stared at her.
 She was harder to stay mad at.

Sleep would be an escape.
 He couldn't bear the images that had come on the heels of his newest realization--images of Marie surrounded by children, making dinner for them, for a husband, kissing him, making love with him .
 .
 .
 His breath caught on a sob of pain.
 He sat up, digging the heels of his hands into his eyes.
 He wished he could stop thinking.
 He wished-- All at once he remembered the pages about Marie he'd copied from the book Teri had lent him.
 They'd told about her life, her children--but that had been before she'd come here.
 Then the pages had changed.

 My chest still ached from panic.

The revolution of rising expectations is a positive, constructive movement spreading to encompass people at all levels of all societies around the globe, and pressing for the establishment of a higher social organization that can meet the expectations of all humanity.
 But the energies liberated by this revolution have to be properly converted into an evolutionary effort for development, otherwise they will fly off in unwanted directions.
 Society must provide the conditions and opportunities for these energies to express themselves positively and constructively in pursuit of their own fulfilment.
 Education is the most essential ingredient for this transformation.
 It is a great leveller of social hierarchy.
 It has the power to transform the propensity for violent revolution into ordered evolution.
 It can temper and mature aspirations and enlighten expectations by an under standing of what can reasonably be sought after and achieved.
 It can impart knowledge of opportunities, attitudes that support constructive initiative and skills for productive application.
 Production technologies that make consumer goods available at lower and lower cost to more and more people also level social differences by extending the benefit of development more widely and evenly.
 The soaring of human aspirations is a natural and irresistible result of goals that humankind has been striving for over the last century.

The onward march of technology is still in full swing, but the political commitment to foster cooperative human security worldwide is yet to emerge.
 The Information Age has given meaning and content to the concept of a global village.
 The threats associated with climate change and biodiversity loss also underline the fact that while humankind may be segregated by political frontiers, our fates are intertwined ecologically.
 Economically also, islands of prosperity cannot co-exist forever in the midst of oceans of poverty.
 Both unsustainable lifestyles and unacceptable poverty must become features of the past, if we are to curb the growing violence in the human heart.
 Ten years after presentation of our report, we remain convinced that universal health, harmony and happiness are still within our reach, if only we imbibe the eternal truth contained in the following message of Lord Krishna delivered on the battlefield of life called Kurukshetra:
 We human beings can become whatever we sincerely aspire to become.
 Looking back, it is astonishing how much the world has changed since the idea of establishing the International Commission on Peace and Food was first conceived in 1987. Who had the foresight to imagine the monumental changes which have so radically altered the political, economic and social complexion of the world community ‚Äì the end of the nuclear arms race and the opposing military alliances of East and West, the rising tide of democracy that dramatically and irreversibly transformed the USSR and the countries of Eastern Europe, the growing importance of the UN in peace keeping and peace making, the peaceful end of apartheid in South Africa, the first tangible steps toward lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East, the completion of global trade negotiations and the founding of the World Trade Organization, and concerted actions to stem the degradation of the environment?
 The mid-1980s was a time when global military spending reached an all-time high of $1.2 trillion.
 Economic growth had slowed or stalled in much of the developing world, prompting some to term the 1980s the 'lost decade' for development.

I didn‚Äôt want brains splattered all over my truck, especially if they were mine!
 I was then shown pictures so I could verify Ashley and recognize Steve.
 It was her, and his head was practically shaved bald.
 He looked like your typical punk kid, just like Brandon.
 ‚ÄúIs his hair still that short?‚Äù I asked.
 ‚ÄúNot the last I saw.
 Why?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, if his hair is longer, I can at least grab him by the head if he pulls a gun on me.‚Äù At this point I was given a lecture and the shots fired instructions again, because apparently I hadn‚Äôt gotten the message the first time.
 I was to stay in my truck and tell them to get in when they arrived.
 I was also told that the dealers would try to move me to another location and I was to stand my ground and never agree to move, even if it was just across the street.
 Steve had a warrant for his arrest in this county so he would attempt to avoid it.

It was known to be very difficult to affect Dire beasts with magic, and his success had shown his power and accomplishment as a mage.
 Rodregas had regretted not being on duty when the Dire Cats were staked out on the roof.
 Rodregas had heard from the other guards that the cats were in heat, and as Ravenhurr had hoped, a Celestial Lion had sensed their presence while the lion was out during the full moon with the Wilde Hunt, and the great lion had spent the last few nights doing his best to impregnate both of the female beasts.
 The whole keep could hear the wild rutting going on.
 Ravenhurr then had goats released on the roof and the Celestial Lion had gorged himself on them when he had finished rutting.
 The well-satisfied beast lay limp, sleeping, confident in his celestial power, and oblivious to his surroundings.
 He lied unbound, as required by the ceremony.
 Rodregas assumed some subtle magic had been used to influence the beast to sleep in just the right spot.
 The unlikely success of having an actual celestial animal as part of the ceremony had put Ravenhurr into an unusually good mood.
 Using one of the Dire Cats in the ceremony would have been good, but an actual Celestial animal would provide much more power.

Cultural Values and Development
 The growing violence, more and more visible disparities between rich and poor, and large-scale destruction of the environment cited in this report have raised widespread concern that the present course of development is undermining the cultural as well as the natural environment for human development.
 A careful analysis of the relationship between culture and development reveals that cultural values are the essential foundation for all lasting social achievement.
 The security, stability, productivity, growth and sustainability of society are determined by its values.
 This report calls upon nations and the international community to make a conscious shift to values that can generate greater domestic and international security, higher rates of sustainable growth, and more equitable distribution of benefits for all.
 The insistence on immediate abolition of war, eradication of poverty, democratic human rights and full employment expresses a commitment to the pre-eminent values of human life, social and economic as well as political freedom, and the development of the full potential of the individual.
 The achievement of these high human values also requires the achievement of a large number of physical, organizational, social and psychological values: higher productivity, better quality, more efficient utilization of resources, faster speed, more systematic functioning, improved coordination and cooperation, punctuality, cleanliness, open-mindedness, tolerance, harmony and a host of other values essential for high achievement in any field.
 Therefore, we have stressed repeatedly the importance of the value of integration in the formulation of strategies, of maximum utilization of human and social as well as material and technological resources, of greater speed and organization, and other values.
 Values are a powerful instrument to spur development.
 They are goals or standards that set the direction and mobilize the collective cultural energies of the society for great accomplishment.

Only it doesn't really count unless your dad, you know, the one who used to make your birthdays really special, is gone."
 Alec's mouth opened, closed, and then assumed its normal place in his unreadable mask.
 He reached out, almost consolingly, but I stepped away before he could make contact.
 I knew I should shut up before I said something really unreasonable, but my anger was in the driver's seat now.
 "Don't try and pretend you're sorry.
 You were just looking for an excuse to get out of class once all of the hero worship dried up.
 Well I got you out and you helped me avoid all of the stupid questions everyone would've asked, so we're even."
 There was another flicker of something I couldn't quite read in Alec's eyes, but I was long past caring.
 I turned and limped off, wishing my ankle was in better shape so I could properly stomp.
 Spanish arrived much too soon.

Alec's fingers gently pulled my chin up as the music ended.
 "Dance with me?"
 I mustered a brave smile as I nodded and let him lead me out onto the dance floor.
 It was a slow song this time, and Alec didn't protest when I abandoned all pretense of actual dancing, and just leaned into him hungrily.
 The reassurance I was seeking was weaker than normal.
 The solid feel of his body was just as permanent as always, but there was no tingle where our skin touched.
 Almost as though sensing my thoughts, Alec hugged me tightly and buried his chin in my hair.
 "I know you don't want to hear this, but it isn't too late for you to change your mind.
 Even now, it'd be a relatively simple thing to have you halfway across the country by the time the challenge actually occurs."
 The thought of what was coming filled me with dread, but I shook my head.

she whispered into his ear.
 "I like it anywhere you kiss me."
 She pressed kisses along his neck and then across his jaw, finally reaching his mouth.
 Their kiss was slow and sweet, and Marie sighed into his mouth.
 "It's so nice," she murmured.
 "What?"
 He tangled his fingers in her hair as he bent to kiss her neck.
 "Being able to kiss the man I love whenever I want instead of having to wait for him to kiss me."
 "You can kiss me any time, anywhere you want."
 He nibbled on her neck.

It shook me from my stupor.
 I climbed down from my horse to stretch my legs over the trunk of a fallen tree, facing the mountain top instead of the view below, some part of me unable to accept the distance and height we had traveled.
 Chevelle led the horses to a thickset tree, its limbs stretching low and wide above the rocks.
 His hand spun to form a trough from the bark and tinder scattered beneath, the horses drinking as he used the same method to gather grasses from the sparse patches on the incline.
 Movement up the mountain caught my eye and I looked to Chevelle in alarm.
 Though he appeared calm, he was staring in the same direction.
 A dark cloaked figure advanced in the dusk, the full cape covering every part of its owner, drawn hood shielding their face.
 Chevelle nodded in greeting as I scanned the area for others who might approach.
 The stranger seemed alone, and reached Chevelle first, since he stood nearer to the horses than me.
 The newcomer whispered to him, and Chevelle‚Äôs eyes flicked my direction more than once.

 I wrote a damn good song.
 I was back, you know, back, but different.
 Different but the same.
 This is what I want everyone to understand.
 What I want to say‚Äîthe difference is not a drama, the difference is a poem, a song, a way of looking at life, that‚Äôs slightly atilt, slightly askew, perhaps, but it‚Äôs all me, you know?
 It‚Äôs what I am.

 The necromancer nodded.

There wasn't time.
 Even if they arrived right now, someone was probably going to get hurt.
 Cassie tossed her hair and smiled, a plastic expression that bordered on a smirk.
 "Shut your lying mouth.
 I'm really going to enjoy this."
 Britney had positioned herself so she could see Brandon.
 As a consequence, I could see Alec's entire group, and I was amazed by their reaction to Cassie's belligerence.
 Jasmin's pretty lips drew back in something that looked almost like a snarl, and she'd tensed up so tightly she was almost shaking.
 For a heartbeat I thought Jasmin would launch herself at the other girl, but Alec reached over without looking, and grabbed her arm.
 A stocky, Middle Eastern-looking boy to Alec's right looked like he wanted to act as well, but he was looking at Alec, and an almost imperceptible headshake stopped him.

In seeking to reject thoroughly the authoritarian form of government that suppressed the rights of the people, many of these countries allowed the power and authority of their central governments to de cline to the point where they could no longer enforce conditions needed for operation of either a command economy or a free market system.
 The power of government in the West may be veiled by the fact that its laws are usually obeyed without the need for exercise of force, but the threat of enforcement is as real for tax evaders in North America as it was for free marketers under the communist regime in USSR.
 Regardless of the system, strong government is a prerequisite for a strong economy.
 The experience of the past few years has clearly demonstrated that the state must play a very active role in order to bring about a smooth and rapid transition and this role cannot be limited purely to regulation of the market.
 Intervention will also be necessary in the form of central planning and industrial policy, at least¬†during the transition period.
 The radical restructuring of entire industries ‚Äì defence, agriculture, aluminium, steel ‚Äì is too complex and massive an undertaking to be made the responsibility of market forces and individual firms.
 7.Agriculture has to be given a special status: For reasons discussed in the previous chapter, the state has an especially important role in the regulation of agriculture.
 After the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, the rise of free market and free trade polemics generated considerable confusion regarding the necessity and legitimacy of state regulation and intervention in protecting and preserving agriculture, which is the beneficiary of innumerable subsidies and supports in virtually every industrialized nation.
 It is ironic that advice coming from overseas almost invariably recommended eliminating sup ports to this critical sector of the economy.
 In the midst of radical economic revolution, the economy, especially the agricultural economy, is in no position to adapt simultaneously to the dual stresses of internal reorganization and external competition.

After all, you stared at me all morning."
 "That's different," he muttered, glancing away.
 "Why?"
 When he didn't answer, she took his hand, lacing her fingers with his.
 "They tried to make a game of picking me up and throwing me into the waves, but I wouldn't let them.
 I didn't let them touch me.
 Not even to help me up."
 She played with a damp, curling lock of his hair.
 "I'm still a woman of the '20s.

I wish to thank every member of the Commission, as well as the many others who have helped us, for their time and vision.
 The Member Secretary, Mr Garry Jacobs, however, merits a special mention for his total dedication to the principles which inspired the setting up of ICPF.
 Throughout the last five years, he has devoted his time and extraordinary talent to the work of the Commission.
 He has been the principal catalyst of the Commission's work.
 In his heavy responsibilities, he has been ably supported by Robert J. Macfarlane and Robert van Harten.
 I wish to record our sincere gratitude to this unique trio.
 Our work has been largely supported by grants from UNDP and UNESCO.
 UNESCO also provided the services of Dr Maurice Goldsmith, Director, International Science Policy Foundation, to edit this report.
 It has been a privilege working with Dr Goldsmith, an editor of extraordinary wit and wisdom.
 I am indebted to Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary General of the United Nations; Dr Federico Mayor, Director General of UNESCO; and Mr James Gustave Speth, Administrator of UNDP, for their support and encouragement.

Rodregas was hesitant to bash his sword too much, as it was of average quality.
 While the sword should be fine for his first match, he hoped to be fighting all day today.
 He went forward leading with his round shield.
 He pushed his combatant back with some hard swings.
 Rodregas swung his shield aggressively, he hit the man‚Äôs sword with his shield and then banged the other man‚Äôs shield hard.
 Rodregas‚Äô goal was to see if he could out muscle the man while staying protected by the shield.
 It worked!
 Clearly his opponent, though set for a heavy blow, was not expecting the strength of Rodregas‚Äô bash.
 Still his opponent was too good to fall, even when surprised.
 And even as he half fell backwards he used the momentum to slide down and try to land a blow low under the shield.

 Besides, even if I were to develop a gift this instant, most of them require practice to master, and I'm not going to have a chance to do any of that."
 "I'm sorry.
 It's my fault that this all happened."
 Alec stopped and tugged me around to face him.
 "Don't be sorry.
 I wish this had happened a long time ago.
 We kept stalling, kept waiting for me to develop the ability to stand Brandon off, and it was the wrong thing to do.
 I should have challenged him when Simon and Nathanial killed the tourists, should have slapped Vincent down the day he almost killed Ben, should have done something a thousand times over, but I just kept waiting.

 The two brothers were almost to the wall when the skulls flew overhead.
 ‚ÄúMake them stop!‚Äù cried Harruq Tun, hands pressed against his ears.
 Beside him, Qurrah Tun stood mesmerized by the sight.
 Hundreds of skulls bathed in purple fire sailed over the walls of Veldaren like dark comets.
 Gaping mouths shrieked mindless wails, their voices bone-chilling and unrelenting.
 A few soldiers fired arrows, but most hid behind their shields.

He'd definitely hesitated.
 It stretched out long enough that for a moment I didn't think he was going to answer, but then he nodded, a long deliberate motion that left no question but that it was a confirmation.
 I wanted to ask more, but didn't want to venture into the kinds of things that would get him in trouble with Alec.
 We walked for another minute or so before I was struck with the silliness of someone who was old enough to be my great grandfather calling me 'Mistress Paige.'
 "Donovan, you could just call me Adri if you want."
 "That would hardly be appropriate, mistress."
 "It just seems silly.
 I mean, I'm not really part of the family or anything, so there isn't really a need, is there?"
 Donovan's smile was incredibly gentle as he shook his head in disagreement.
 "You're very much a part of the family, and if I may be so bold, I'm quite delighted by your inclusion.

She stopped playing shortly after Mom finished up the piece you just heard."
 His expression was so serious now that I almost stopped him before he could continue.
 "She stopped when she realized that 'Welcoming' was the only celebration of childbirth mother was going to write."
 I felt my smile sour, and tried to turn away, but Alec caught my chin and gently pulled my face up, forcing me to meet his gaze.
 "You don't need to feel embarrassed.
 It's not something that's easy to talk about.
 It's even harder for Rachel to discuss, but sometimes those things still need to be examined.
 It's actually a relief to tell you.
 There are so many open secrets around here.
 It comes from living in such close quarters, from everyone being able to hear what's said anywhere in the house.

I'd had plenty of people hate me since I'd arrived in Sanctuary, but he was the first person I'd met who I was convinced wouldn't have thrown me a life preserver if I was drowning.
 It wasn't even because saving me would be too much work.
 He was completely convinced the world would be a better place without me.
 I'd never been so unnerved in my life.
 As Mrs. Alexander took roll and then released us into our groups, I was still trying to pull myself back together.
 It didn't help when I realized we were being evaluated today.
 I fished out my notes and desperately tried to remember how to calculate some of the stuff we'd need to know in order to successfully get our weight up the ramp, over the obstacles, and otherwise to the appropriate destination using the minimum number of pulleys, the shortest ramp, and the thinnest string possible.
 Alec hardly even looked up as Mrs. Alexander came by with our particular spool of thread, an array of metric weights, and a note card bearing the amount of weight we'd been assigned to move around.
 I was still leafing through my binder when Alec started testing the strength of our 'tow line.'
 I scooted my desk over and picked up a weight to hand to him, only to see the thread break as he successfully figured out the breaking point.

The progress I'd made lately notwithstanding, I half expected the question to drive me into a panic attack.
 Apparently Alec's presence was proof against a second near attack today.
 "I don't know.
 We always used to do the standard kind of stuff.
 Presents, eggnog and the Christmas story.
 Usually Dad made us breakfast Christmas morning and then we'd drive out of the city later in the day and go sledding.
 I hadn't thought about what it would be like this year."
 Alec nodded like he'd just checked a box off on some kind of mental list.
 "So snow's always been a pretty key ingredient sounds like."
 "I guess.

It had just now occurred to her that she wouldn't be able to walk in the garden for the whole week they were gone.

 That thought filled her with an astonishing sadness.
 Sadness, not just disappointment over Hollywood‚Äî-because she'd miss Rick.

He was a middle-aged, blond-haired man who had numerous scars on his face.
 ‚ÄúGreetings to you as well, guard captain Antonil,‚Äù Dieredon said, taking a step back and kneeling.
 ‚ÄúThough I fear greetings is all I may offer you.‚Äù
 Antonil pointed to the wall, and he asked something which neither could hear when the orc army shouted another communal roar.
 ‚ÄúThe Ekreissar will not aid you,‚Äù Dieredon said when the noise died.
 He shook his head, and a bit of sadness crossed his face.
 ‚ÄúWe have been forbidden.
 Ceredon insists this is a minor skirmish, nothing more.
 We are not the keepers of man.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúMinor skirmish?‚Äù Antonil shouted.

‚ÄúAgain, I do as I wish,‚Äù Qurrah whispered.
 ‚ÄúWho are you talking to?‚Äù Harruq asked.
 ‚ÄúQurrah, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 He tore his gaze back to the fight.
 More orcs had pushed inward, leaving them bunched in a wide circle.
 They flung themselves against the surrounding guards.
 Again he felt a cold chill, this time creeping across his arms like frost spiders.
 The sensation of being watched was unbearable.
 ‚ÄúWe need to move,‚Äù he said.

There was something so wrong about it, but I couldn‚Äôt say why.
 I pushed away the urge to question an associate of Council, instead asking, ‚ÄúChevelle?‚Äù He smiled.
 It was only one word, but he understood.
 I was asking if I could address him in the common dialog, not the official titles and formalities of the Council he might have been used to.
 His head tilted in a nod.
 And we sat so, tucked in the narrow space behind a small library table, for hours.
 He pulled books between us and returned them to the shelves, never once glancing at the papers spread out beside us referencing the northern clans.
 Nothing we studied touched on the histories of those clans.
 Nothing of his histories, nothing of mine.
 But conversation had become easy as soon as I had spoken that first word, as soon as I had said his name and he‚Äôd smiled in return.

 Johnny ‚Äì No, I used yellow food coloring.
 We were out of red at the time.

 However I doubt that voodoo curses would solve our problems anyhow.
 Liz ‚Äì Red food coloring would have been a little better, but not much.
 Jim ‚Äì You could have at least used Tabasco sauce or something, we always have that.

I finished up the day's homework, and made it more than halfway through one of my makeup assignments by the time Mrs. Campbell stopped off at my desk.
 "Care to run another errand for me, Adriana?"
 I didn't really want to.
 Not when I'd just discovered I had more studying to do than was humanly possible.
 Still, Mrs. Campbell had always been super nice, if equally stern, and there was only ten more minutes of class left.
 Besides, I'd been so intrigued by the sight of Alec drawing that I wanted to see him like that again.
 If he could take such joy in the creation process, maybe he wasn't as bad as he seemed.
 The only way to know for sure was to see him with all of the masks off again.
 "Sure, I'd love to.
 Mrs. North again?"

Alec took my hand.
 "Are you okay?"
 I shook my head.
 "This is going to be really bad, isn't it?"
 His silence validated my belief, probably even more than he realized.
 "I'd...we'd...spare you it if we could."
 It was my turn to shake my head.
 "No, this is my fault.
 I belong here, not cowering in a corner somewhere."
 Rachel hugged me from one side while Dominic placed a gentle, dark hand on my other shoulder, and then we were off.

And about Godzilla being feared, well I was talking to Rusty down the street.
 Jim ‚Äì Wait, you mean the same Rusty who never leaves his parent‚Äôs basement and watches nothing but Japanese cartoons?
 The one who got thrown into the school dumpster every day at lunchtime by the girls chess team?
 Eugene ‚Äì That‚Äôs the Rusty and it‚Äôs called Anime.
 Well Rusty was telling me about how it‚Äôs illegal to yell ‚ÄòGodzilla‚Äô in a Japanese theatre, like how it‚Äôs illegal to yell Fire in an American theatre.
 He says that it‚Äôs because the Japanese are that afraid of Godzilla.
 And who can blame them after he ruined Tokyo so many times.
 But anyways Rusty said that most older Japanese people will just soil their shorts even at the mention of their old nemesis.
 Not only that, but everyone knows the name Godzilla.
 Godzilla will be perfect!

 She smiled then, reaching for his hand.
 "Come on--let's go."
 "Wait.
 You need to put on shorts and a shirt over your bathing suit."
 "Oh.
 OK."  She went to do as he said.
 Marie had been to the shore before, but it had been years ago.
 Her father didn't think it was appropriate for a young woman of her position to be parading around half naked.
 If only he could see her now, she thought with a grin as she took off her shirt and shorts.

 Alec stared back up at the clouds rather than meet my eyes.
 "Not yet.

 "Please.
 Do you really believe I have that kind of willpower?"
 "After the things I've seen you go through I'd never doubt your willpower, Adri."

 We‚Äôre talking about what to do next,‚Äù she scowled.
 ‚ÄúWait,‚Äù an idea jumped into my head, ‚Äúhow about we meet under a truce.‚Äù Emily stared at me.
 ‚ÄúA truce?
 Seriously?
 That is the complete opposite of what we‚Äôre doing.‚Äù ‚ÄúI know but trust me; we need to meet under a truce.
 What about monster fighting and this whole puzzle with the dwarfs?
 Did we just forget all about it or are we not going to do our job anymore?‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still fighting, Jazell.

A soft blow of air from her lips turned the grass to dirt so that a large space lay available for her to write on.
 She wrote ‚ÄòHarruk‚Äô in the dirt with her finger, spacing out each letter.

 ‚ÄúHow about my last name, Tun?‚Äù
 She wrote out T-u-n.
 The half-orc stared, absorbing every detail of his name.
 ‚ÄúCan I see your name?‚Äù he asked.

 Alec shrugged.
 "I came out okay all things considered."
 He was going to have to rethink this deflection thing, but now didn't seem like the time to get pushy.
 I forced a measure of gaiety into my voice and smiled up at him.
 "Well, I'm glad things turned out the way they did.
 Otherwise we'd both be dead."
 Alec flinched slightly, and then looked at the grotto.
 "I suppose I'd better clean this up or Donovan is going to be very unhappy with me."
 "Who's Don...." I felt my mouth drop as I finally recognized my surroundings.

Technology of organization
 Much emphasis is placed on the widening gap in technology between North and South, but the gap in the technology of organization is even greater.
 Creation of new types of systems and organizations can create markets and jobs in many ways.
 The Dutch system of flower auction co-operatives is so successful that 68 per cent of the entire world‚Äôs exports of cut flowers pass through markets in the Netherlands.
 The franchise system has led to a rapid proliferation of new businesses and new jobs in the West in such widely diverse fields as food services, home remodelling, dry cleaning and real estate.
 Industrial estates, export processing zones, export promotion councils, export insurance, warehouse receipts, quality standards, and thousands of other organizational innovations have been either created or borrowed by developing countries to accelerate social progress.
 A comprehensive study of successful systems and institutions that can be transferred and adapted to local conditions will document the enormous untapped potential for stimulating faster economic and job growth by inventing, imitating and further improving social systems.
 Action Plan to Stimulate Employment in Developing Countries
 Employment generation is a product of multiple factors that combine together.
 Stimulating job creation requires a comprehensive approach, rather than partial policies or piecemeal strategies.

 ‚ÄúBut you better not keep anything else from us or Kojas won't be your problem.‚Äù She winked at him and set off with Jason on her heels.
 I think they were going to start arguing about the water war.
 ‚ÄúGreat job Seth!‚Äù I said and hugged him.
 His eyes seemed to widen in surprise but he didn't tell me to get off.

While the application of computers has already been extended to all these fields, there has not yet been a systematic effort to assess the employment potential that can be tapped by fully extending and accelerating this movement.
 The recent initiative in India to establish knowledge centres in every Indian village by 2007 is one example of a pioneering effort to harness ICT as a means to catalyze a whole range of on-farm and off-farm rural activities, which will inevitably translate into more and higher productivity and greater employment generation.
 These centres can be utilized to deliver technological expertise to upgrade farm yields, vocational training and education, purchasing and marketing information to raise incomes.
 The experience of India also shows that bridging the digital divide helps to bridge the gender divide in the area of knowledge and skill-intensive work.
 As the construction of rural roads acts as a stimulus to agricultural development of isolated communities by connecting them with sources of inputs and markets in the outer world, ICT can be a catalyst for stimulating the entire gamut of economic activities in rural communities throughout the developing world.
 At the other end of the spectrum, ICT is opening up unparalleled opportunities for self-employment and new business creation for the educated.
 Today more than 50 per cent of American workers utilize computers in their work.
 The growth of the World Wide Web has given rise to on-line global markets in which individuals can bid for a broad range of projects involving activities such as research, translation, technical writing, proofreading, desktop publishing, and business consulting.
 A new publication identifies a few hundred self-employment opportunities of this kind.
 The future of work will offer increasing opportunities for people throughout the world to match their specialized knowledge and skills with specialized employment opportunities wherever they may originate.

I had nothing outside of home, outside of the village.
 I didn‚Äôt even know where to go, didn‚Äôt know where I was.
 It was just another clearing outside of the only town I‚Äôd ever known, the only town I remembered knowing.
 I wandered toward the briar patch, finding it easily.
 It hadn‚Äôt been far, despite my exhaustion.
 I crawled through the narrow path I‚Äôd made the previous time.
 It hadn‚Äôt seemed such a tight fit in only pants.
 I settled in, jerking a length of skirt free from the thorns with a spray of colorless beads.
 Brushing the loose dirt off the papers I had buried, I laid the soiled documents across my lap and untied the laces binding them together.
 I stared at the words on the ancient parchment, unable to believe what I was reading was true.

 In theory she might be working on stuff for the brochure, but somehow I knew she was busy chasing her dreams once again.
 Good luck, I'll see you later.
 --A.
 My backpack creaked and groaned as I picked it up.
 Luckily most of my classes weren't moving as fast as I'd expected.
 I was far enough ahead I could start picking a few subjects and working on them every night instead of bringing home my entire locker every day.
 As always, it was already heating up despite the sun having only barely cleared the mountains.
 It did seem like it wasn't quite as hot though.
 Maybe it was getting late enough in the year to bring the temperatures down slightly.

"I don't know what I'd have done without you these last few weeks."
 My heart went pitter-patter, but still mindful of the fact that throwing myself at him would just result in him freaking out and keeping me at arm's length, I managed not to go all gooey on the outside too.
 Unfortunately the effort meant I was slow responding.
 He moved on before I got anything out.
 "How's your homework coming?"
 Now I did frown at him.
 "I think my mind's going to explode if I look at my Biology book even just one more time this weekend.
 Other than that things are great."
 Alec's chuckle seemed to reach out and caress me.
 "I take it you'd be up for a brief field trip then?"

Yeah right!
 Jim ‚Äì They‚Äôre both healthy active adults.
 They made you didn‚Äôt they.
 Just in case you slept through health class, sex is how babies are made.
 Liz ‚Äì First of all, it‚Äôs disgusting thinking about my parents doing that.
 Secondly, even when they sleep in the same house, they sleep in different beds.
 Jim ‚Äì They sleep in different beds?
 It‚Äôs like a 1950‚Äôs television show.
 Anyways they could push the beds together from time to time.
 Liz ‚Äì They couldn‚Äôt push the beds together though, they sleep in different rooms.

Oh, not Adri?
 Very good then, Adriana it is."
 I watched bemusedly as Mrs. Alexander searched through her pockets for something to write with for at least half a minute before realizing she'd placed her pen behind her ear.
 The form now signed, the pen went back behind her ear for safekeeping, and she motioned me to a seat, predictably at the back of the classroom.
 As I negotiated the crooked path between desks, I found myself looking forward to the class.
 Right up until Alec slipped into the classroom a few seconds before the bell rang.
 If there'd been any justice in the universe, he'd have somehow gotten uglier over the last few hours.
 That or I'd have developed some kind of partial immunity to him.
 Neither was the case, he was just as unearthly gorgeous as he'd been in the hall.
 The sight of him was almost overwhelming.

He had not taken off his armor.
 Although the knife had pierced the leather weave, the tip penetrated less than an inch.
 Rodregas gritted his teeth and pulled the knife free.
 From the feel of its balance, it was not a real fighting weapon, but only a simple utility knife.
 Rather than try to use the unfamiliar weapon that was slick with his blood, he threw it into the dark.
 Quickly Rodregas remembered he was in a fight for his life.
 He backed up from his confused opponents and gave himself more space.
 It was the middle of the night and there was only a sliver of moon, but he could still make out the forms of his attackers; there were four of them.
 No, a fifth stood away from the others and watched.
 The one who had stabbed him had the most aggressive posture: he looked tall and strong; Rodregas knew he had to take him out quickly so he moved in hard.

Since 1989, the birth rate has fallen by more than 20 per cent in Poland, 25 per cent in Bulgaria, 30 per cent in Estonia and Romania, 35 per cent in Russia and more than 60 per cent in Eastern Germany.
 Such abrupt changes have been observed previously in industrial societies only during times of war.
 Infant mortality is rising in many of the countries.
 Not surprisingly, there have been increasing indications of public discontent and voter dissatisfaction with the course of the reforms in the vast majority of countries.
 Simultaneous Shocks
 The collapse of the East European and Central Asian economies from 1990 to 1994 resulted from their exposure to a series of simultaneous shocks.
 1.Stabilization and adjustments: The majority of countries, having suffered from inflation and balance of payments problems in the 1980s, applied sharp stabilization and adjustment programmes in the early 1990s to stop inflation, balance budgets, and close balance of payments gaps, while at the same time liberalizing prices in order to correct major price distortions.
 These deflationary policies led, in most cases, to sharp declines in output.
 2.Resource allocation: Sudden dismantling of the central planning machinery responsible for the allocation of materials for current production and allocation of funds and materials for investment in these countries was another shock.
 It proved impossible in the majority of countries to create and organize, overnight, commodity and financial markets of sufficient depth and flexibility to substitute effectively for the planning machinery.

LE:  	It‚Äôs alright, Love.

 It lasted about a year.
 She was there when we recorded some of our first songs, I remember that.
 She loved, uh, ‚ÄúHayley Mill‚Äôs Underpants.‚Äù  For some reason, she thought that was her song.
 Maybe because Carol was a young woman who loved lingerie.
 And, as a young man, who appreciated a young woman who loved lingerie, well, we had some fiery times.

World military spending has not declined significantly because the competitive security paradigm remains intact.
 Steps being taken by the members of the European Union to build a truly cooperative security system indicate the right direction for the world as a whole.
 It is no wonder that the first such initiative comes in Europe, which has been the leader of thought for the past 500 years ‚Äì from the birth of modern science and parliamentary democracy to nationalism, socialism and universal education ‚Äì and which has been working for the past five decades to evolve a viable working model of fully democratic, voluntary supra-nationalism.
 Democratization of the UN: The phenomenal advance of Europe‚Äôs multi-dimensional unification is a clear indication that in future international institutions will play a more important role than national governments.
 But this can happen only to the extent that these institutions are living proponents of democratic functioning and individual freedom.
 Ten years ago ICPF called for the democratization of the United Nations by abolition of the veto power in the Security Council, induction of new members to make that body more representative, and establishment of democratically-elected representative government as an essential condition for membership or active participation in the UN system.
 The nexus between democracy and prosperity is undeniable.
 The democratic revolution that has so effectively penetrated Eastern Europe in recent years and extended its roots in other regions must be taken to its logical conclusion at the level of nations and at the level of international institutions.
 World Peace Army: The most far-sighted of ICPF‚Äôs proposals sought to evolve a practical mechanism to promote the objectives of cooperative security and democratic freedom.
 It called for the establishment of a World Peace Army, to be constituted by and open to all democratic countries willing to renounce the right to aggression against other nations and willing to contribute personnel and resources to an international multilateral military force capable of defending its members from external threats.

Rodregas slammed the door closed and relocked it.
 Then he quickly reached down and covered Korin‚Äôs mouth, pulled him up, and slipped behind him.
 Rodregas saw Korin‚Äôs bulging eyes as he tried to get a better look at his captor.
 Korin struggled but not as if his life depended on it.
 He was probably confused.
 The image of the day that Rodregas had started to hate him came back.
 A family of AElves had been taken prisoner; they were just common AElves with no real magic.
 Korin was interested in the father, a good-looking man.
 The wife was equally beautiful and they had a slim child named Jorin.
 Rodregas had taken Jorin under his wing.

Now after prayer and meditation came first the practice of the Kata, and then the staff and then finally the books.
 The true change came in the evening, the nights were full of such pleasure and joy such as Rodregas had seldom known in his life.
 The rest of summer passed as the most joyful that he had known, as the three started to the Kata and the staff.
 After the staff they moved to the bow where Imeralda became the master.
 To use the magical Black Yew bows required learning a spell to merging with the bow.
 The spell was unlike anything Rodregas had learned.
 Imeralda said it was seldom taught to non-nymphs, though Ravenhurr had known the spell and taught a few of the guards with a touch of the talent.
 Using the bows was a matter of sending your innate power into the wood and singing with it.
 Not singing out loud, but making the power vibrate and move in a rhythm that matched the wood.
 When that magical rhythm was reached, the bow suddenly became almost fluid and moved nearly of its own volition.

How?‚Äù
 The half-orc reached over, erased the k in his name and drew a clumsy, capitalized Q at the end.
 He leaned back and smiled.
 The name in the dirt now read ‚ÄòHarruQ‚Äô.
 ‚ÄúWhy did you change it?‚Äù she asked.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a rather odd spelling.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúLook at my brother‚Äôs name,‚Äù he said.
 Aurelia did, and then she saw what Harruq had also seen.
 ‚ÄúYour name is your brother‚Äôs, only backwards.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYup,‚Äù Harruq laughed.

Eventually they became clearer, though they didn‚Äôt make much sense.
 After a time it occurred to me the problem was the images were mixing with the wrong sounds‚Ä¶ real sounds.
 Panicked sounds.
 I thought I recognized Chevelle‚Äôs voice and tried to focus on it, to understand the agony.
 ‚ÄúFrey,‚Äù he said, and something brushed my cheek, warm and feather light.
 The distant impression that it might have been the brush of lips had me drawing in a sharp breath, and I coughed, gasping to fill my lungs.
 The air shifted as those surrounding me moved in response.
 I forced my eyes open and found Ruby, Steed, and Chevelle.
 They looked for a moment as if they were suffering my pain‚Ä¶ and then I realized the pain was gone, the siren was silenced.
 My breathing steadied, the fear abating, and their faces relaxed.

I went straight for the shotgun then marched back down the icy sidewalk telling myself I would only shoot the Polish guy.
 A block short of the clubhouse, Tony met me.
 By the time I finished telling my plan and reasons, the rage had waned just enough so I let him have the gun.
 A few days later, Bob and I caught a ride out of Albany, Georgia with a slick young man named Johnny.
 His blond hair was oiled and wavy.
 He wore a silk shirt and drove a fast, red convertible.
 Though he claimed to have gotten out of prison only yesterday, he blazed at about twice the speed limit down Highways 19 and 41 into Florida and all the way to Miami.
 He talked about money, women, and other stuff he‚Äôd missed while in prison.
 When he asked if we would be looking for work in Miami and we said probably, he nodded and chucked my arm.
 ‚ÄúHey, the boss will set you up.‚Äù The boss lived in a palace on a canal.

Do you need to get warmed up?‚Äù A little flame of fire flickered to life in her palm.
 I gave a shaky laugh.

 ‚ÄúI'm feeling the same way.
 But don't worry, they,‚Äù she motioned to the boys, ‚Äúdon't have to know.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey'll find out eventually,‚Äù I mumbled.
 ‚ÄúBut that doesn't have to been now.

 ‚ÄúIt's like going throw the bogey-man's home.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe must not get a lot of visitors,‚Äù Emily commented.
 ‚ÄúI'm defiantly not coming over anytime soon.‚Äù Emily laughed and the boys stopped walking.

I started as black swirled around me.
 Chevelle had thrown a cloak over my shoulders.
 He moved in front of me to hook the clasp, his dark eyes piercing as he stood so close.
 My heart stuttered when he leaned in, our faces unbearably near.
 Just before he touched me, his cheek slid alongside mine, his mouth at my ear.
 I froze as he spoke low, his breath on my neck sending a shiver through me.
 ‚ÄúStay.
 Still.‚Äù He was gone.
 He moved so fast it took a moment to understand.
 The hood of the cloak was drawn over my head, Chevelle standing a good distance away, facing the trees.

Marie found that she loved shopping for modern lingerie.
 She liked lace and rich colors and chose black, emerald, fuchsia, and royal blue underwear.
 It really didn't matter, she supposed, what her underwear looked like.
 But she couldn't wait to get home and change into her new things.
 "Thank you for-for .
 .

 the new clothes, Rick," she said shyly, taking his arm as they walked away with their purchases.
 "Now I won't have to wash my clothes every night."
 He looked down at her with chagrin.

And Junnie, mysterious under a hooded cloak, fighting with magic and weaponry, killing members of the council guard.
 We sat around a fire, telling stories.
 Someone was ribbing Ruby.
 Her eyes narrowed when she replied to him, matter-of-factly, ‚ÄúYour mouth is very small.
 It‚Äôs unattractive.‚Äù And her head bobbed side to side as she smiled, pleased with herself.
 Anvil laughed and his tongue wagged.
 He was holding someone by the arm, preventing them from running away.

 And Chevelle.
 He was in so many of my dreams.

He still needed more hard money and some decent clothes.
 Rodregas looked out the window to see a few people leaving the keep grounds, and a few still hanging around the yard.
 He knew he could not leave without everyone seeing him.
 He searched the rest of the study in the daylight.
 He found nothing of real use until he pulled a drawer completely out of the desk and found a false back to the drawer.
 He found it was holding a purple silk purse containing eight pieces of gold and two of silver.
 Now he had the money he needed to be on the run.
 After forcing himself to wait until the last visible person left the main gate, Rodregas grabbed the trunk and went to the stairs.
 He listened quietly, and hearing nothing, he set the trunk down and quietly walked down the stairs.
 The next floor housed the laboratory.

 She was halfway down the stairs when she remembered she'd promised Rick that she'd wake him up so that he could stay within earshot of her.
 "Rick," she called, tapping on his door.

People needed him.
 We needed him.
 Around noon, I mentioned how stricken Mrs. Bole had looked.
 Billy suggested we ought to tell her that Eric hadn‚Äôt blamed her for expelling him.
 We parked out front of the school, climbed the steps, and had just turned the corner to the hall in front of the office building, when a girl ran out of the office sobbing hysterically.
 She might‚Äôve known Eric, but not well.
 Still, when she spotted us, she ran up and clutched one of my hands and one of Cliff‚Äôs.
 She blubbered a minute and finally spat out, ‚ÄúEric‚Äôs dead.‚Äù Suddenly kids rushed us from all directions.
 I felt like carrion under attack from buzzards.
 I broke loose from the girl and hustled into the nearest classroom building and into the restroom.

Inevitably, drug trafficking is linked with illicit arms, terrorist groups and the Mafia.
 Criminal elements are increasingly gaining control over the administrative and political structures of drug-producing states, where drug-related corruption permeates the military and government.
 Neither the proliferation of small arms, nor the proliferation of drugs, nor the growth of terrorist and criminal activity can be solved as isolated problems, or by the independent initiatives of individual states.
 No country is exempt from the danger, which will continue to multiply unless checked and eradicated by concerted international action.
 Urgent steps are needed to classify and register small arms production and trade, to monitor and control their manufacture and limit their export.
 Agreements are needed to reduce production and severely restrict sales.
 Strong sanctions must be instituted to discourage states from actively or passively aiding or abetting small arms proliferation.
 The scope of the UN Conventional Arms Register should be expanded to cover small arms, but at the same time its provisions must be greatly strengthened in order to make this an effective mechanism.
 Reporting must be made mandatory rather than voluntary, and an independent surveillance system should be established to monitor compliance.
 The five permanent members of the Security Council, which together account for 80 per cent of the world‚Äôs arms sales, should also set up a system for mutual consultation on all large weapons orders.

 But then she saw him and ran to him, throwing her arms around him.
 "I couldn't get back home!"
 "Shhh, shhh--it's all right."
 He hugged her, rocking her gently.
 "How am I going to get back, Rick?
 Am I stuck here forever?"
 "Come on--let's go have some breakfast, and we'll see what else we can think of."
 She let him lead her back to his house.
 Sitting at the table while he made breakfast, she wiped her eyes and cheeks and nose with a paper napkin.

In India, sugar consumption is projected to rise from 13 kg to more than 25 kg, generating a demand for a 100 per cent increase in sugar cane production, the establishment of 300 to 400 new sugar mills in the country and the creation of 3 to 4 million new jobs in this industry alone.
 Worldwide, raising the average level of sugar consumption in developing countries could generate tens of millions of additional jobs in agriculture, industry and services.
 Viewing the future demand for food from this perspective reveals a tremendous opportunity.
 Vast sections of humanity now aspire to the higher quantity, wider variety and greater nutritional content of food once consumed only by the wealthy.
 An effort to raise nutritional standards in the developing countries nearer to the levels prevalent among industrial countries will not only eradicate hunger, but also dramatically spur economic growth, employment, and purchasing power among the rural poor, stimulating growth of production and jobs in industry and services, as well as increasing exports and imports.
 Raising the entire world population to the level of the prosperous nations would require a 72 per cent increase in total world food production, measured in terms of calories.
 In order to meet the people‚Äôs nutritional requirements for fruit and vegetables, India‚Äôs production of these crops needs to double within the next decade.
 Achieving that high level will generate more than six million new jobs in the country.
 Broadening the scope to include other agricultural products, particularly textiles, the potential for accelerating global economic growth by an agriculture-led strategy is even greater.
 Cotton is a crop with a very high income and employment multiplier effect.

 It was not his turn to answer any question other than from the Grand Marshal.
 The Marshal Faurrenida voice made his displeasure and his dislike of arguing with a non-knight clear as he said, ‚ÄúWhile a knight has the full right to enter both the Lesser and Greater Sigil Chambers and take and sigil as his level of magic might allow, it is not a sigil he earns today.
 It is knighthood.

 To forestall any further argument, the Grand Marshal stepped forward quickly and drew his sword.

I'm really going to enjoy this."
 Britney had positioned herself so she could see Brandon.
 As a consequence, I could see Alec's entire group, and I was amazed by their reaction to Cassie's belligerence.
 Jasmin's pretty lips drew back in something that looked almost like a snarl, and she'd tensed up so tightly she was almost shaking.
 For a heartbeat I thought Jasmin would launch herself at the other girl, but Alec reached over without looking, and grabbed her arm.
 A stocky, Middle Eastern-looking boy to Alec's right looked like he wanted to act as well, but he was looking at Alec, and an almost imperceptible headshake stopped him.
 I'd been so busy watching the byplay behind Rachel that I'd missed the last two exchanges between her and Cassie.
 Whatever had been said must have been bad though.
 Rachel was shaking, and the blonde looked like someone about to pull the wings off a butterfly.
 I could feel my heartbeat climbing, slamming away at my ribs with all the energy of a full-blown panic attack, but I wasn't dizzy, just scared.

Nuclear Weapons
 The threats to future peace come in many forms and at many levels, but unquestionably the most pernicious and potentially devastating is the peril from nuclear weapons.
 The end of the nuclear arms race between the superpowers may have removed the looming fear of all-out nuclear war and annihilation that surfaced in the artistic drawings of young American school children in the mid-1980s, but the horrible genie of Hiroshima and Nagasaki will continue to haunt us until every nuclear weapon has been destroyed.
 The very existence of the nuclear stock piles carries its own inherent dynamism for their utilization, which is likely to be expressed intentionally or accidentally sooner or later.
 There have been repeated efforts by the non-aligned nations to move a resolution in the UN General Assembly that the use of nuclear weapons should be declared a crime against humanity and outlawed.
 One hundred and twenty-six nations have voted for the resolution.
 It is ironic that the opposition to this resolution and justification for the continued possession and possible use of nuclear weapons come solely from the most militarily, politically and economically powerful group of nations, which are militarily without adversary and at the same time in the best position to afford and institute alternative means for their national security.
 Here lies the real key: the insistence of the few most powerful nations on perceiving security in their own terms, and their insatiable urge to achieve ever more of it for themselves at the expense of greater insecurity for others and the world as a whole, even though their goal can never be achieved on this unilateral basis.
 During the Cold War, nuclear weapons were legitimized by the five permanent members of the Security Council which are the nuclear weapon states.
 Now that it is over, the governments of these nations seek to justify continued possession and the option to use these weapons, even while exerting every possible pressure to stop proliferation to other countries.

Anyways, I mostly just wanted to stop by and see if us girls can take you shopping tomorrow."
 The non sequitur really threw me for a loop.
 "I left my money at home.
 I'm not much of a shopper anyways."
 That last part sounded pretty weak even to me.
 "Don't be silly.
 Alec hustled you out of your house so quickly you didn't get to bring anything but the clothes on your back.
 Jasmin's clothes will fit you pretty well, but that's only a short-term solution.
 We need to get you stuff to wear, and since it was Alec who created this mess, it's only fair he be the one to pay."
 I was absolutely sure there was no way I was ever going to fit into anything Jasmin owned, but girls being girls, there was no point in protesting.

My pants started to scrunch up causing this slide to be very annoying.
 I decided to ignore it because I had my bow in my hands and had more important things to worry about.
 We crouched behind a rock and watched the group walk off.
 Seth started to stand up and signaled me to wait for him.
 He jumped over and ran out into the open.
 He leaned forward and narrowed his eyes, probably trying to see the disappearing bunch.
 He held his hand out, signaling me to wait.
 Then he beckoned me and I stood up.
 Then someone tapped me on the shoulder.
 I bit back a scream and whipped out my knife.

Ravenhurr then had goats released on the roof and the Celestial Lion had gorged himself on them when he had finished rutting.
 The well-satisfied beast lay limp, sleeping, confident in his celestial power, and oblivious to his surroundings.
 He lied unbound, as required by the ceremony.
 Rodregas assumed some subtle magic had been used to influence the beast to sleep in just the right spot.
 The unlikely success of having an actual celestial animal as part of the ceremony had put Ravenhurr into an unusually good mood.
 Using one of the Dire Cats in the ceremony would have been good, but an actual Celestial animal would provide much more power.
 Rodregas‚Äô hands clutched into a fist at his side as he could not help thinking that the last thing the world needed was for Ravenhurr, or any of the Immortalists, to acquire more power.
 Rodregas knew there was almost no opposition to the Immortalist left, but futile as it would probably be Rodregas could no longer go along with their immoral acts.
 Rodregas pulled his thoughts back to the roof.
 He would only have one shot at this.

It still wasn't light by the time I finished showering.
 The fact that my body was, at least partly, still on Minnesota time should have helped, but the morning was just as unbearable as normal.
 Fighting back a yawn, I flipped on my bedroom light and examined the half-dozen boxes that might contain my clothes.
 I debated searching through them all, but it would just mean another fight if I did find them.
 With a sigh of resignation I walked over to the chair where I'd left my selections from the night before, and pulled the faded jeans up my frail-looking legs.
 I finished up with a tank top, covered by a light blue blouse.
 All Cindi's stuff.
 Thoughts of her were just as dangerous as they'd been last night, but maybe I was getting a little better.
 Feeling like a traitor, I headed my skittering thoughts off before they could start affecting me physically, and focused on the next step in getting ready.
 There was a lot more at stake this morning than last night.

Apparently my looking up was enough of a response for her to proceed.
 "I've got a note from Mrs. Campbell.
 She asked me to deliver it to you."
 I managed something that could just barely be construed as a thank you, took the note, and watched her leave.
 A note from a teacher, even one I liked, didn't seem very important when weighed against failing two of my six classes.
 The reoccurring thought of how horrified my Dad would've been that his daughter, 'the smart one,' was going to flunk out of high school was enough to keep me constantly on the edge of a panic attack.
 The longer that went on the less ability, and even more dangerous, the less desire I'd have to try and fight it off.
 I finally opened up the note more out of a need for a distraction than any real inclination to find out what it contained.
 Adriana.
 I'm afraid I've been called into a surprise meeting with the school administration.

I'd never seen them so close together.
 They were so careful not to cross paths, it was possible this was a true first, but seeing them now there was no way to get around the fact that Brandon was at least two inches taller, as well as being broader and more muscular.
 I'd seen Alec shirtless, and he had the incredible physique of a swimsuit model, but Brandon's was that of a professional body builder.
 Either of them dwarfed me, but Brandon gave off an air of menace that even Alec's controlled power couldn't offset.
 Brandon's next few words came out in a low growl that I couldn't make out, and then he slowly backed away from Alec before he and the rest of his pack disappeared from sight.
 I finished processing everything about the time Alec turned and walked back.
 I opened my mouth to protest, but he shook his head at me as we all fell into formation around him.
 From what little I knew about Alec's pack, it wasn't uncommon for them to spend time together without the kind of chest-beating byplay that was so much a part of Brandon's group, but our lunch table was even more subdued than I'd expected.
 Faced with an almost complete lack of conversation, I didn't have the courage to ask some of the questions on my mind.
 It wasn't until I'd followed Isaac to my history class that I finally worked up the nerve to find out more of what was going on.

While jobs are being eliminated in low-skilled manual or assembly operations, simultaneously they are being created in industries that manufacture and service the more sophisticated machines, as well as in Research and Development (R &D) laboratories that develop the new machines, materials and manufacturing processes.
 The workers who operate the improved machines require higher levels of skill, which demands more education and training, thus creating demand for jobs in the service sector.
 The more productive and higher-paid industrial workers utilize their enhanced purchasing power to buy more goods and services than before ‚Äì spending more on travel, consumer goods, housing, leisure, health and the education of offspring, and thus creating demand for more jobs in other industries.
 Rising incomes generate higher standards and expectations, bringing changes in lifestyle that create new needs and new commercial activities.
 This process has led to enormous growth in new jobs.
 The best documented example of this process is the automotive industry.
 Inspired by the idea of making a car the working-class masses at the turn of the century could afford, Henry Ford adopted new manufacturing technology, the automated assembly line, to produce the first low-priced automobile.
 Ford‚Äôs technology increased worker productivity more than seven-fold and reduced production costs by two-thirds.
 As an immediate result, thousands of small manufacturers of custom-built cars and horse-drawn carriages were put out of business.
 But the growing demand for low-cost vehicles generated explosive growth for the industry, creating tens of thousands of new jobs in the process.

Mom looked like she was starting to waver.
 "It does seem like a great opportunity, but there just isn't any good way to know for sure it's legitimate."
 That didn't sound like Alec at all.
 "Are you sure, Mom?
 They didn't arrange anything you could use to verify they're for real?"
 I suddenly realized why parents got such a big kick out of catching their kids doing something wrong.
 Mom looked so sheepish I almost laughed.
 "Well, he did say he'd arrange for an immediate advance to be wired over to our bank, but it's closed on Saturdays, and it isn't like I can go calling up the bank president for something trivial like that."
 I opened my mouth, still unsure what to say in response to her latest excuse, only to be interrupted by her cell phone again.
 "Yes, this is she.

 Qurrah broke away from his brother when the last died before them.
 He could smell the fear of the villagers, and like a tracking dog he could use it to find where they fled.
 Flames danced across the side of one house, alerting Qurrah.
 The half-orc coiled the whip around his arm and pulled out a scrap of bone from a pouch.
 It was time to test the spells his master had taught him.
 An elderly man came around the corner, a torch his only weapon.
 He glared at Qurrah with unabashed hatred.

It was as if someone had sucked all of the joy and goodness out of the sound I'd grown to crave on a nearly subconscious level, and left a twisted shell.
 "She's definitely distracted.
 You could even say utterly disconnected from the world.
 Completely free from the present, always living in the past."
 "I don't understand how any of this ties together."
 He looked up at me for the first time, and the tortured look in his eyes made me hold onto his hand as tightly as I was able.

 But it belongs in 1927 with my family.
 My brother is getting married, and I think his fianc√©e should wear it.
 But I'd like to buy a gown for our wedding.
 I want to save it for our daughter."
 Rick's breath caught.
 "Our daughter."
 He hugged her.

I had a feeling he‚Äôd been itching for this the way I‚Äôd been itching to burn Ruby.
 Steed smiled in acceptance, but not the same smile he‚Äôd given his last opponent.
 They stood across from each other and readied themselves.
 Both tensed but neither took the low, wide stance previously used.
 As their eyes fixed on one another, I felt myself, and Ruby beside me, lean forward in anticipation of action.
 Both men went taut, their muscles corded, jaws clenched tight, determined stares focusing only on each other.
 I saw nothing happen but knew there must be something, some unseen force causing them pain, draining them.
 I couldn‚Äôt look away but stammered to Ruby, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey are trying to overpower one another.‚Äù I could hear the pleasure in her voice.
 ‚ÄúNo silly games, just power.‚Äù The way she said it had some part of my mind wondering whether her statement about not having her mother‚Äôs ambition was true.
 But I could only concentrate on the struggle in front of me.

"Are you sure Teri likes garlic?"
 "She loves it."
 "What about Jeremy?
 You don't know him that well--maybe he's a vegetarian."
 They were having meat lasagna.
 "Maybe I should make something else, some spaghetti or--" "Shhh."
 He took her face in his hands, making her look into his eyes.
 "Everything'll be fine, sweetheart.
 You're a terrific cook, and they'll love what you've made."
 He brushed his lips over hers.

But you have to tell me what happened.
 You wanted so badly to go home."
 He gazed down into her eyes.
 "You loved me, and you were completely torn apart, yet you wanted to go home so badly that you left me.
 What happened?"
 Tears shimmered in her eyes.
 "I was miserable.
 I mean, I was really happy to see my family, and we felt closer than ever.
 They thought I'd been kidnapped at first, but when there was no ransom request, they were afraid I'd been murdered.
 They were out of their minds.

The words were broken by gasping sobs, but they were understandable, if only just barely.
 Alec's hand on my shoulder just made me try to roll away.
 I didn't want his pity.
 Not after everything else he'd already done for me.
 Guilting him into helping me more just felt wrong.
 He captured me in his iron grip, stopping me from getting up and running away.
 "Adriana Paige, it isn't that I don't want to be with you.
 I want it more than anything else right now.
 That's¬†why I'm not sure it's such a good idea."
 His face had somehow gotten so close to mine that I could see his eyes, and they were dead serious.

The voices are theirs.
 The story is theirs, even as it belongs to a generation.
 Let us hearken back, briefly, to those days when music was being made because it was important, because genius finds its own level, because people needed godhead, if that‚Äôs not overstating it.
 Before the drugs, the recriminations, the lawsuits, the doubting of the very fiber of what the 60s meant to Memphis, to these sweet souls herein, and to the world at large.
 Let us reimagine it, if we can, in all its efflorescence.
 In all its pied beauty.
 Let‚Äôs hear again, ‚ÄúTurntable Poison‚Äù as if for the first time and marvel at the voice that said, ‚ÄúWe are all naked.‚Äù  That said, ‚ÄúLove me for my limo but love me all the way.‚Äù  And, that said, presciently, ‚ÄúDeath is only a way station, between West Memphis and the coast.‚Äù These interviews were done in three sessions in early 1973, in San Francisco, by Creole Myers, at Buddy Gardner‚Äôs home.
 Lorelei Enos was in and out.
 One of the startling revelations found in these tapes is that Lorelei was with Buddy until the end.
 Rumors had her abandoning him after they had left Memphis for Los Angeles.

No maniacs are allowed to exist except for me and Emily.‚Äù He jumped off as I stabbed the one on my arm.
 I grabbed my bow and shot him with an arrow before he his little legs could he him very far.
 He fell to the ground, the arrow sticking straight up at the sky.
 Now the forest was maniac free.
 I killed the others and looked up to find the thrashers dead too, probably courtesy of Seth.
 A few dwarfs were also lying dead in front of Emily.
 I walked back to my body and closed my eyes.
 When I reopened them, I stood, stretching my legs.
 The four of us headed back to the restaurant together, adrenaline still pumping through my veins.
 I told Emily and the boys about the freaky dwarves.

"That's a good idea, but it's getting late.
 You shouldn't be wandering around out there in 1927 or 2011.
 Why don't you wait until tomorrow morning?"
 He smiled, taking her hand.
 "Come on--dinner's almost ready."
 She enjoyed the meal he'd prepared, and her eyes grew wide with delight when he set dessert in front of her.
 "I love chocolate ice cream!"
 she exclaimed.
 "I'm not surprised."
 He smiled as she ate with relish.

Alec wouldn't have brought you here until he was sure it was the latter."
 I closed my mouth in astonishment.
 "I didn't realize Alec had talked to anyone about me.
 Actually I think you just let more drop in a few sentences than he's told me all week.
 Alec claims it's because I could be put in danger just by knowing certain things, but I think he's still just not quite sure he can trust me."
 Mallory slowly leaned back in her chair, and then shook her head.
 "No, it isn't because he doesn't trust you.
 If he didn't trust you, he wouldn't have brought you here.
 He'd trust Isaac or Jasmin with his or even Rachel's life, but neither of them know about me.
 In fact, bringing you here expands the circle of people who know about me to a grand total of three.

But as he stretched out beside her, she realized how very much she wanted to return the favor.
 Pushing herself up, she reached for the bottle of lotion.
 "Turn over, and I'll put some on your back."
 He flipped onto his stomach, closing his eyes in anticipation.
 Ahhh.
 Those soft, slender hands imitated what she'd felt him do to her, rubbing and caressing.
 He only wished he could get her to do his chest as well so that he could gaze up at her as she ran her hands over him.
 Marie liked touching him.
 He was big and muscular, and she'd thought that just looking at him without his shirt was a great pleasure.
 But that was before she'd gotten to run her hands over him.

I'm lost!"
 But then she saw him and ran to him, throwing her arms around him.
 "I couldn't get back home!"
 "Shhh, shhh--it's all right."
 He hugged her, rocking her gently.
 "How am I going to get back, Rick?
 Am I stuck here forever?"
 "Come on--let's go have some breakfast, and we'll see what else we can think of."
 She let him lead her back to his house.
 Sitting at the table while he made breakfast, she wiped her eyes and cheeks and nose with a paper napkin.

Aurelia spun, evading a downward strike slicing through the air by just an inch.
 She continued the turn, her staff whirling.
 The swords sliced, trying to block, but they were too slow.
 The staff cracked against Harruq‚Äôs forehead.
 He staggered backward, his eyes going wide and blank.
 ‚ÄúYou could fell an ogre with that hit,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúVery funny,‚Äù Aurelia said.
 She smiled.
 ‚ÄúThat was my first good hit of the day.

They couldn‚Äôt meet anyone‚Äôs eyes; their pinpoint pupils darted around the room when I spoke to them.
 They couldn‚Äôt answer simple questions coherently.
 They babbled and told those outrageous stories.
 They were sick.
 When my wife and I heard sirens or the phone rang late at night, we always thought the worst.
 Certain police or crime television shows would give us lumps in our throats as we would silently look at each other and know we were thinking the same thing‚Ä¶ that might be our son.
 One afternoon while I was at work, Lisa was trying to help Brandon out by organizing some of his bills.
 Brandon told her that he needed to run a quick errand.
 She called me later that day and said she had lost track of him and he wasn‚Äôt returning her calls or answering his phone.
 All the usual horrible thoughts began to surface in our minds.

My life for you, _Qurrah shouted as the world crystallized.
 A red line slashed across his mind, and as the dream shattered into shards the words of the dark man ripped through him._
 Then come reap the rewards.
 Qurrah lurched awake, gasping for air.
 His throat ached, and he could feel the tiniest trickle of blood down his trachea.
 The night was still deep and the town quiet.
 Beside him, Harruq snored loud enough to wake the drunkest of men.
 Far away, a wolf howl beckoned.
 ‚ÄúSleep well,‚Äù Qurrah said, leaving the town.
 His doubt faded with each step.

Jasmin almost hummed under my fingertips like barely-leashed violence, while my other hand drank from the still pond that was Dominic, her mere presence feeding me comfort.
 I'd just finished identifying the raging beast to the right as James, when Brandon stepped into the light.
 He looked like some kind of pagan god, smeared all over with blood, an uneven circle drawn on his chest, filled with sharp, angry lines that didn't mean anything to me, but which made the wolves around me tense and growl.
 "While I appreciate the sentiment, it really is far too late to secure absolution by bringing me the girl."
 His voice had changed, becoming deeper and harsher, with elements that didn't sound like they could come from any human throat.
 He stepped forward, and I felt my chest seize up.
 The transformation I'd sensed the beginnings of at the dance had run its course now and any question as to why someone as cultured as Brandon would associate with a near-psychopath like Vincent was put to rest.
 He was shaking now, quivering with the need to kill, and I realized that it didn't matter whether the darkness inside Brandon had created Vincent or just attracted him to orbit in his sphere like a small moon.
 It was enough to know that Vincent's was the lesser evil.

 You really shouldn't go there; he's brutal when it comes to breaking girls' hearts."
 There was a story there, but I wasn't about to ask now and expose myself to further ridicule.
 Britney was oddly quiet as we entered the lunch room.
 I was a little hungry, but the pangs were a distant kind of discomfort.
 The real suffering for not eating wouldn't come into play until we hit the tutoring lab.
 Oh well, when I got home ravenous and ate a decent-sized meal Mom would probably be ecstatic.
 Or too wrapped up in some project to even notice.
 It was hard enough anticipating what I was going to do from day to day.
 Trying to figure Mom out was truly futile.

 The chorus of droning moans agreed.

 ‚ÄúIf there was any time I needed you, Sonowin, it is now,‚Äù the elf said as he fled across the grass.
 Each breath made his chest ache.
 His right arm hung limp, and his other hand clutched his shoulder.
 He desperately needed to bandage it but had no time.
 A wave of undead moans reached his sensitive ears.
 Dieredon shuddered.

 ‚ÄúWake up, Qurrah.‚Äù
 The half-orc lifted his eyelids to see the thoroughly unwelcoming sight of Velixar frowning down at him.
 ‚ÄúYes, master?‚Äù he asked, puzzled, for it was still before dawn.
 He had slept no more than a few hours, he figured.
 ‚ÄúWho is it your brother travels with now?‚Äù Velixar asked.
 ‚ÄúYou say he has abandoned you, but to whom?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúAn elf named Aurelia,‚Äù Qurrah said as he sat up.

Vincent's voice was a low, unnatural thing, pitched so it was just barely audible for humans.
 Cassie's expression made my stomach tighten up and my gorge rise.
 It wasn't right for a girl to look at another girl like that.
 Like she couldn't wait to watch Vincent do all kinds of terrible things.
 "Payback sucks, doesn't it?"
 Jasmin's complete stillness was an eerie counterpoint to the waves of power still beating at me.
 I somehow knew she was just seconds away from springing when the sound of running footsteps caused all three to turn.
 Alec appeared around the corner, followed by Isaac, just a split second before Brandon sauntered into view from the opposite direction.
 The tingly feeling grew exponentially more powerful with so many more shape shifters present.
 Rubbing my arms did nothing to ward off the feeling that entire colonies of insects were skittering across my skin.

A product of her temper, her human emotions.
 They were testing her, a servant told me.
 Anvil was holding her back, Rune with magic.
 She snapped and they saw her power.
 Some denied the possibility but not my father.
 He has attained his prize, that which he has always coveted.
 I will stop him.
 ~ The plan is forming, but I am unsure whether it will work.
 I know I cannot defeat him, and his guard, alone.
 But I must protect my Freya.

It didn't help when I realized we were being evaluated today.
 I fished out my notes and desperately tried to remember how to calculate some of the stuff we'd need to know in order to successfully get our weight up the ramp, over the obstacles, and otherwise to the appropriate destination using the minimum number of pulleys, the shortest ramp, and the thinnest string possible.
 Alec hardly even looked up as Mrs. Alexander came by with our particular spool of thread, an array of metric weights, and a note card bearing the amount of weight we'd been assigned to move around.
 I was still leafing through my binder when Alec started testing the strength of our 'tow line.'
 I scooted my desk over and picked up a weight to hand to him, only to see the thread break as he successfully figured out the breaking point.
 Again and again it happened.
 I ran a calculation for how many pulleys we'd need to lift our weight up the thirty-degree incline on a string able to hold only a fourth as much, only to look over at his paper and see not only had he already arrived at the correct figure, he'd already thought to adjust for starting friction.
 Not used to being outclassed academically, I got flustered, which led to a misplaced decimal, and then an incorrect conversion from English to metric.
 Alec just continued on, never seeming to really hurry, never actually making a mistake, but still grinding through calculations with a speed I might have been able to match on a good day, but couldn't even approach today.
 It would've been much easier to just stop my efforts and watch him work, but I was too stubborn to give up.

The words "I love you too" formed in her mind, but his tight embrace had knocked the breath out of her and kept the words from slipping out.
 "Rick," she gasped, "please put me down."
 He set her down and then took her face between his hands, raining kisses on her lips and cheeks and eyelids.
 "I love you so much."
 She put her hands on his chest and pushed away.
 "Let me catch my breath!"
 "I'm sorry."
 He caressed her cheek.

A wisp of bright blonde hair swirled around Junnie‚Äôs shining eyes as the door swung open, and I decided I must have caught her working; she looked flustered.
 Junnie was older than I, but remained striking with the blonde hair, blue eyes, and thin features that seemed to be standard-issue among the village elves.
 The Council had assigned her as my tutor, citing my advanced age as the reason I couldn‚Äôt learn with the others, but I suspected it was my stunning lack of ability that had landed me here.
 Junnie brushed a lock of hair aside.
 ‚ÄúThere you are, my Fredora!‚Äù She was always trying out new nicknames for me.
 It was no secret I despised my given name: Elfreda Georgiana Suzetta Glaforia.
 I decided, not for the first time, my father must have been a drunken imp.
 Not that I could remember him, but I could definitely blame him because the father was always responsible for naming the firstborn.
 It wasn‚Äôt as if you could get more unoriginal than using the ancient word meaning ‚Äúelf‚Äù, but he certainly hadn‚Äôt needed to follow it with a string of ridiculous, flowery‚ÄîI stopped mid-thought, realizing my tutor was watching me.
 ‚ÄúHey, Junnie,‚Äù I said, forcing a smile.

At least Red‚Äôs only half wicked.‚Äù His sister.
 I was having trouble wrapping my mind around it all.
 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, she‚Äôs had her fun with you.
 She‚Äôll be helpful now.‚Äù He grinned and I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was sarcastic.
 ‚ÄúBesides, sounds like you‚Äôre the biggest trouble going.
 She‚Äôd do well to stick around you.‚Äù I frowned.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep an eye on her,‚Äù he promised.
 ‚ÄúYou?‚Äù I asked, remembering Ruby‚Äôs announcement.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre traveling with us?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt mind, do you?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, of course not,‚Äù I gushed.
 It was too eager, so I explained, ‚ÄúChevelle‚Äôs been training me.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, we can certainly help with that.‚Äù I grimaced at the thought of Ruby‚Äôs training methods.

He had a strong urge to clean up his bunk and leave the area in the order it deserved, but that would be too big of a hint of what had happened.
 So, he was careful to leave it as it was; the longer they thought he was Ravenhurr the better.
 He then walked past the rest of the wooden cots of the barracks to the back where the captain‚Äôs room was.
 The captain‚Äôs room, unlike the outer barracks, was spotless and in perfect order.
 He searched through the captain‚Äôs pair of trunks and found some clothes that fit him, though tightly.
 The captain had been a big man but not as large as Rodregas now was.
 Still the soft linen shirt of light brown, which he knew had been loose on the captain, was much more comfortable than the wizard robe he had been wearing.
 Unfortunately none of the pants would fit.
 Poir, though a large man, had skinny legs.
 Rodregas felt ridiculous wearing only a linen shirt and his coin purses as he stepped to the armory door.

‚ÄúHe was the one going crazy to bandage you and was worrying more than the rest of us.‚Äù Seth‚Äôs face reached a new undiscovered level of red, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to lose a friend.‚Äù ‚ÄúRight‚Ä¶‚Äù Emily trailed off and smirked at him, wiggling her eyebrows.
 Seth squirmed slightly and avoided her gaze.
 I started to laugh but in morphed into a cough instead.
 I clutched my midsection to find it was covered in bandages.
 ‚ÄúWhat exactly happened?‚Äù I questioned.
 Seth glanced at Emily and back at me, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know.
 We turned around to see you being mauled by a Thrasher.
 Before either of us could do anything, some light appeared out of nowhere.
 When it died down, we found you lying on the ground unconscious.
 That‚Äôs basically it.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know what the light was.‚Äù Emily added.

I wish she was‚Ä¶ different.
 Not merely a different personality, but different altogether.
 I can remember the stories in my mother‚Äôs journal about her own sister.
 They were so close.
 That was, of course, until my father.
 But I suppose my sister might be different as well, if not for him.
 He‚Äôs taking a journey, they tell me.
 He‚Äôll be gone a long time.
 I‚Äôll be here alone, except for Rune.
 He‚Äôs to continue my practice.

The sentences should have been a careless mess based on the speed with which he was writing.
 Instead they turned out more even and carefully constructed than anything I'd ever been able to accomplish.
 I'm the Alpha here; you can ask your questions when I finish with mine.
 The flippant, humorous nature of his response was so atypical, and yet still quintessentially Alec.
 I nearly broke into a fit of laughter that would've gotten us both in even more trouble with Mrs. Sorenson.
 I roll my eyes at you...a lot.
 So once you're done, I get to ask you any question?
 No restrictions?
 That was nearly a deal breaker, I could see it by the way his initial smile at my 'rolled eyes' faded away into his more characteristic seriousness.
 He contemplated his response for a good fifteen seconds, which was probably something like two hours in shape shifter time, before finally touching his pen to the paper again and then passing my notebook back.

She'd probably like chocolate.
 There wasn't time to make anything, so chocolate ice cream would have to do.
 He still couldn't believe that this had happened.
 He didn't believe in extraterrestrials, he didn't believe in ghosts, and he certainly didn't believe that people could travel through time.
 But here she was.
 His mind reeled with the implications and unreality of it all.
 And the emotion that permeated his jumbled thoughts was guilt.
 He'd been preoccupied with thoughts of Marie ever since he'd seen her picture.
 Was it possible that his thoughts had somehow brought her here?
 But even if that were true, how could he have known that thinking about someone would cause her to appear?

They went to bed early, but still, she didn't wake up until almost 9:00 the next morning.
 There was no use walking in the garden this morning, she decided with a yawn.
 She listened carefully but didn't hear Rick's shower or any noise in the kitchen.
 It was past his usual breakfast time, so he'd be starved when he got up.
 She could have breakfast ready for him, maybe even serve it to him in bed.
 Jumping up, she pulled on a pair of shorts and a t-shirt and ran downstairs.
 She didn't know how to make very much, but she could scramble some eggs, prepare bacon in the microwave, and make some toast.
 It didn't even take very long.
 She put a glass of juice and a cup of tea for Rick on the tray and a glass of milk for herself.
 Carefully she carried it upstairs.

What choice did I have?
 And then I laughed, because I couldn‚Äôt even trust myself.
 I expected him to look at me like I was mad.
 Instead, he looked like it was‚Ä¶ endearing.
 He stood and walked over to me, taking my hand to help me up.
 When he touched me, I tried to fight the heat that ran up my neck.
 I couldn‚Äôt and embarrassment caused my cheeks to color as well.
 I peered up at him through my now-dark bangs and could have sworn it amused him.
 I laughed at myself.
 The silly romance I‚Äôd been reading in the diary must have been affecting me.

When I moved back to my hometown of San Diego from Chico, I left behind a tenured professorship.
 My two kids lived with me and cost plenty.
 So I started teaching all around.
 One semester, I taught nine classes at four colleges, about 90 hours a week, which left me too weary to write, or so I thought.
 My son Cody and I went to Tae Kwon Do classes twice a week.
 And I was managing Cody‚Äôs Little League team, hoping he might become a pitcher instead of a ninja.
 Probably because I didn‚Äôt sleep enough, my emotions had shut down, and every day I sensed impending doom.
 Something had to change.
 My kids didn‚Äôt deserve a catatonic dad.
 One late afternoon as I sat on the grass at the University of San Diego, overlooking the harbor and wondering how I could fix my emotions, I mumbled, ‚ÄúOkay, where should I start?‚Äù Then I remembered advice Master Jeong, our Tae Kwon Do instructor, often gave.

He was enjoying teaching Kata, both for himself and because they were both eager students and learned quickly.
 CHAPTER 8 THE TEST BEFORE THE TEST
 Over the next few weeks Rodregas, Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda fell into a regular routine.
 It quickly became clear that while Imeralda might not be a trained mage, she was far more knowledgeable than Doi‚Äôvan or Rodregas in magic.
 So, while Rodregas often led the training in the morning, she led during the afternoon.
 Rodregas thought Doi‚Äôvan was learning far more quickly than any of the squires that he had trained with as a teenager.
 Doi‚Äôvan looked like a daemonic nightmare, and he clearly loved to test his strength in battle, but he was an amazingly quick learner both with the forms and with the books.
 Even though Doi‚Äôvan could not read, Rodregas would read him some of the Grimoires, since they were the only books they had.
 His insights and questions were insightful, and Rodregas realized that Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs intellect was greater than his own.
 Two weeks into the routine the three were starting to get into the rhythm; they had moved into the old house and for not having a roof, it was pretty comfortable.

‚ÄúI was wrong though, and quickly realized that those who follow the Lords of the Infernal Realms were even a worse fit for me than at home, though they did see me as royal blood and not tainted.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan added, ‚ÄúI eventually decided to start somewhere new and took a ship across the inland sea.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan paused at this and shook his head, his hair flying wild, as he seemed to want to shake out a memory from his massive head before he continued.
 ‚ÄúI am afraid I did not ask enough questions.
 I just wanted to get a fresh start.
 I was in Guild Dealer Taigas‚Äô Menagerie to be sold within a week of my arrival.‚Äù He finished, his smile fading at the memory.
 ‚ÄúWhen was that?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 Doi‚Äôvan looked at him for a second and said, ‚ÄúTwo years ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut that makes no sense,‚Äù Rodregas said, his voice angry though he did not know why.
 ‚ÄúThe Guild is supposed to be trying to make their Immortalists members Celestial.
 Why would they hold you for two years?‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan nodded but then shook his head.
 ‚ÄúTrust me, I would like to know that answer more then you.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs smile was now long gone and with a shrug of his huge misshaped shoulders, he changed the subject.
 ‚ÄúSo, Imeralda, the stone here still seems strong and like new, though clearly, it has been long after the construction of this place.‚Äù She was looking at Doi‚Äôvan strangely and it seemed to take her a moment to shift gears and answer his question.

I remember going to the bank and walking in or out with bags of cash.
 The ‚ÄúJudge‚Äù was actually a Judge and he lived next door.
 He was a nice man.
 I babysat his kids and watched his house while he vacationed, and did some odd jobs for him.
 My stepfather and his associates spoke openly about their various girlfriends and the dual lives they led.
 Dino also had a girlfriend and a separate apartment in which he put her up.
 My brother and I were young and we were afraid of this man so we didn‚Äôt disclose what we knew to anyone.
 When I was about fourteen years old, I missed curfew, which I knew was a big mistake.
 I tried to open the door with no sound.
 As I turned in the entryway to close the door as quietly as I had opened it, I felt a presence.

Bravely they fought, and bravely they died.
 ‚ÄúRun, run, run!‚Äù Jeremiah shouted to a mother pulling along a young boy.
 ‚ÄúRun west, and don‚Äôt look back!‚Äù A horrible shriek of pain tore his attention past them to a circle of torches, held by the gathered defenders of the small village.
 He kissed his sword as he approached, horrified by the massacre he saw in the dim light.
 A great half-orc bore down on a strong child of thirteen that Jeremiah knew well.
 Strength in fields and spirit meant little compared to the might of a warrior conducting the dark god‚Äôs power.
 Condemnation tore through his rusted sickle, cut his arm from his body, and then hooked around, severing his ankles.
 The boy fell, dying in four pieces.
 Jeremiah knew then he would enter the golden eternity before the dawn.
 Someone swung a torch while another man thrust his short sword.

 Evelyn shot a glower at me.
 And then she whirled, storming away, and as she glanced back, her parting expression was so priceless I wished I could see it again.
 ‚ÄúAchoo!‚Äù ‚ÄúChoo!‚Äù ‚ÄúHachoo!‚Äù My ears popped as I burst out with laughter.

The orc collapsed, white smoke rising softly from his tongue.
 In the sudden blinding light, Qurrah laughed.
 ‚ÄúNever,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúcould I have imagined it so beautiful.‚Äù

 An hour before dawn, the city‚Äôs soldiers cornered and killed the last of the orcs.
 The Tun brothers were not there to watch, for they had snuck back to the outer wall at Qurrah‚Äôs insistence.
 ‚ÄúI know his plans,‚Äù Qurrah whispered as they stared across the open grass and the arrow-pierced orc bodies that covered it.
 ‚ÄúHe is familiar to me, though I know him not.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt your former master, is he?‚Äù Harruq asked as he adjusted his newly acquired swords.

A knowledge of weather patterns boosted productivity in agriculture.
 A knowledge of astronomy enabled sea-worthy vessels to travel across the oceans to distant lands.
 This led to the invention of systematic education as a method to pass on acquired knowledge and skills to the next generation and thereby continuously increase them.
 The Ultimate Resource
 These rich and varied discoveries came as the result of a careful observation and analysis of the external world around us, an infinite exploration and experimentation with things, an endless trial and error blending of minerals and plants to forge metals and produce medicines.
 As a result, for millennia we have tended to overlook or, at best, grossly underestimate the greatest of all resources and the true source of all the discoveries, inventions, creativity and productive power found in nature ‚Äì the resource that has made minerals into ships that sail the skies, fashioned grains of sand into tiny electronic brains, released the energy of the sun from the atom, modified the genetic code of plants to increase their vigour and productivity ‚Äì the ultimate resource, the human being.
 World Food Prize recipient and father of India‚Äôs milk revolution, Dr V. Kurien, has decried the tendency to credit external factors for the accomplishment of people.
 ‚ÄòIt is the farmer that has produced this miracle, not the cow.‚Äô And so it can be said of the Industrial Revolution and the Green Revolution.
 Looked at from a different perspective, the entire evolution of civilization is a progressive act of humanity‚Äôs self-discovery.
 At each stage of external observation and exploration, people have discovered more of their own inner capacity for resourcefulness.

Felewen stood beside her and faced the window.
 Her hair was tied in a long, black ponytail, her slender figure covered by rare chainmail crafted of the hardest metals known to the intelligent races.
 She had come from deep within Nellassar, the thriving capital of the Dezren elves, as just one of many that had arrived to protect the town.
 ‚ÄúMany are dying,‚Äù Felewen said.
 ‚ÄúThe humans have a spellcaster of their own who repelled our ambush.‚Äù
 Aurelia nodded.
 She knew something had gone wrong; otherwise, the battle would have been over in seconds.
 ‚ÄúVery well,‚Äù Aurelia said.
 ‚ÄúWill you accompany me?‚Äù

Without another word he strode out.
 Imeralda followed him as did all the squire‚Äôs attendants.
 It was time for the final match.
 Rodregas left his shield and mace relaxed at his side and strode over to Nordien, who stood with shield and mace at the ready.
 Instead of attacking he asked the big man, ‚ÄúSo, are people right, do you plan to serve the Immortalists if you gain the greater sigil?‚Äù The squire looked around a little confused.
 He was clearly not expecting a conversation, but no one was near enough to hear.
 ‚ÄúThe Immortalists are the true power of the realm.
 To tie ones self to them is only smart,‚Äù Nordien responded.
 ‚ÄúSo, you do not deny it,‚Äù said Rodregas.

If they were this worked up about the fight, it was a good thing I didn't share any other classes with Alec.
 The rest of the school must be three or four times as bad.
 Sketching helped block out all of the inane conversation that'd taken over the other corner of the room.
 It was amazing how easily I was able to zone out while drawing.
 Once again, I didn't try to guide my hand, just let my subconscious create a horizon and start fleshing out a body of water and droopy trees around it.
 The sound of a hand coming down hard on a desk pulled me from my refuge.
 "I told you all to keep it to a dull roar.
 I want everyone back to your seats."
 A couple people looked like they wanted to give the sub a hard time, but these were all the kids who were hoping to make it into the top ten percent of their graduating class.
 None of them really had a disobedient bone in their body.

Harruq began his story.
 He told her of a gift from his brother, a tiny sword Qurrah had whittled from bone.
 A bully had stolen it, but then Qurrah used a dead rat under his control to steal it back while they slept.
 The haircut and the story ended at the same time.
 Dirty hair was strewn over the grass.
 ‚ÄúNever had much,‚Äù Harruq said.
 ‚ÄúThat bone sword was my only possession.
 Still had to hide it because of that bully.
 You know, it‚Äôs probably still there, buried underneath our home.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYou and your brother had such rough beginnings,‚Äù Aurelia said, tucking away the dagger.

What about you?"
 I shouldn't have been surprised by the question, but I was.
 Possibly because I'd spent too much time around people like Britney who were so caught up in their own lives that they didn't really care about what was happening in mine.
 "Les Mis√©rables.
 The music from the musical is so inspiring that I know the book must be truly wonderful."
 I let the statement hang in the air for a couple of seconds, and then finished up with the truth.
 "Of course I don't really know, because it's so big, and parts of it are so boring, that I may never manage to get through the whole thing."
 Chapter 10 The rest of the afternoon finished up on a quiet note.
 After I went back to my table, Rachel worked on some homework for a few more minutes, and then gathered up her things and slipped out.
 I decided the new guy wasn't a football player when he started gathering up his books.

 She finally cried herself to sleep, and Rick carried her up to bed.
 He felt guilty for trying to get her to stay, but he was sure she loved him as much as he loved her.
 She wouldn't be so upset if she didn't.
 Laying her on her bed, he smoothed her hair.
 She had been here for over four weeks, and she'd had no indication that there was a way back to 1927.

The spare lances were gone.
 He had lost.
 Doi‚Äôvan was of course referring to the healing sigil.
 He wisely did not say it out loud as every squire there would have been asking about where they had gotten one.
 Rodregas started to get up, but quickly decided it was smarter to stay lying down for now.
 ‚ÄúWhere did we finish?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúActually we did pretty good.
 There were more than a few that cannot go on, even if you had won.
 You finished eighth overall in the tournament, with a second place white ribbon for the joust.
 Several of those who would now be higher are too injured to continue.

he asked, hovering over her.
 "I want to go home!
 I don't belong here--I want to go home!"
 Her heart was beating wildly, and she was having a hard time catching her breath.
 The fear and panic that had faded with fatigue and the novelty of it all were suddenly back full force, and all she knew was that she was far from home and from everything she knew.
 "Calm down.
 Calm down, Marie."
 He sat down, drawing her into his arms.
 His embrace made her feel secure enough to swallow her fear.
 When her breathing had returned to normal, she pulled back to look into his eyes.

 "How does the airplane get in the air?"
 They were on the plane waiting for takeoff.
 Marie was in a window seat, squeezing Rick's hand as she looked out the window.
 "The plane goes really fast down the runway until the air lifts it."
 "It's so big and has all these people in it.
 How does it stay in the air without falling?"
 "I don't know much about aerodynamics."
 "About what?"

No?
 Don‚Äôt know him?
 Anyway, I was sitting there and there was a legal pad on the coffee table because earlier in the day I had tried writing a song about my mother‚Äîdon‚Äôt ask‚Äîand it was sitting there like an invitation and I was speeding like a hell-rooster, man, and I just picked up the pad and this big fat marker, I mean I was writing these huge thick letters on the  page (laughs) and I just started, ‚ÄúYou were mean to me/Leave me alone, let me sit in my tree/You were a snake, I needed you then/you were like bad heroin.‚Äù  And I ripped the whole thing off in about an hour.
 And I recorded it that night in my living room, fingers tearing over my strings till they bled, I was playing so hard, like Richie, and that song, that was recorded in my home‚Äîit sounds like it.
 But it was born of anger, and so, well, it‚Äôs not one of my faves.
 Lor came back about dawn and I was still up and I was crying, just sitting there crying with the guitar in my lap, and she put her arms around me, and that‚Äôs the story of that song.
 Last time I took speed.

"Did I ever tell you about my wedding gown?"
 "Your mother‚Äôs?"
 "Yes.
 It's beautiful.
 It's covered with lace and pearls, and it has a 15-foot train.
 But the important thing is that it was my grandmother's.
 She wore it, and then my mother wore it.
 I've always known that I'd wear it when I get married."
 He frowned.
 "It means that much to you?

"Adriana."
 I spent too much time correcting my mom.
 It came out a little rude.
 I would have tried to smooth things over but I was too busy trying to brace myself against the panic attack I was sure was coming.
 My vision swam for a moment, but all the practice compartmentalizing my mind seemed to be paying off.
 I looked up.
 Britney looked a little crestfallen.
 She was probably deciding to ask for a different seat assignment after class.
 "Sorry about that.
 I don't really like it when people shorten my name.

I'd seen gangs work together like this before, but it seemed strangely out of place in Sanctuary.
 I was positive there was going to be a fight after all, but then Vincent grabbed some poor freshman, shoved him into Isaac, and pushed his way downstairs as Isaac caught the human missile.
 As soon as Vincent was safely out of sight, everyone surged forward to congratulate Isaac on having saved Ben, and Ben on having not died.
 ** The near fight between Isaac and Vincent and then Alec's intervention seemed to be the buzz for the next two hours.
 It appeared that a lot of other people felt the same way that I did.
 Alec was plenty prickly and stuck up, but that was nothing compared to how much the average student hated Vincent, who seemed to delight in making everyone's life miserable.
 The teachers seemed curiously ignorant of everything.
 Nobody else seemed to think that was unusual, which freaked me out almost as much as Ben having nearly gone over the stairs.
 At least I didn't have to listen to all of the gossip during lunch.
 Once I'd been able to hobble down the stairs, I'd made my way to Mr. Whethers' room, and I'd spent the entire lunch break studying.

I worked to calm myself.
 No, I was getting better, not worse.
 I felt a light pressure on my forehead and my eyes flew open instinctively, though I‚Äôd had no response from them all the hours I‚Äôd struggled to force them open.
 It was Ruby.
 She sighed with relief.
 ‚ÄúOh, Frey.‚Äù I was suddenly surrounded and the sight made my head spin.
 I closed my eyes tight in an attempt to stop it.
 ‚ÄúGet her a drink,‚Äù someone commanded.
 I felt the hand in mine then, as it was pulled away, replaced with a glass.
 I grimaced; I doubted I could hold a glass up, let alone myself.

‚ÄúWhy do you hunt with me, Goddess?‚Äù The Lion growled.
 The Goddess Blodeuwedd answered, ‚ÄúI am proud of you.
 I will be truthful, I shared my favor with you simply as a matter of convenience.
 I hoped you might succeed.
 I did not think you would live, much less add to your power and gather more hunters to our pride.‚Äù The great Lion shook his head, the ways of the winds and the speech of gods were the same, fickle and not to be truly understood.
 Yet he sensed that somehow the words sounded fair and right in some way that he could not really explain.
 Blodeuwedd smiled at him, a smile that answered nothing but claimed to answer everything.
 The two continued to walk through the tall grass.
 After a few minutes she spoke, ‚ÄúThe Gods and Daemon Lords are allowed to choose champions, but are not allowed to speak directly to any mortal.
 For this moment you are enough in the Celestial Realm for me to ask you a question: I don‚Äôt understand why you have chosen that.‚Äù As she spoke she raised her slim perfect arm and pointed at his shadow.

He was feeling exhausted.
 His body might be surprisingly strong and quick but apparently it still needed to sleep on a regular basis.
 As soon as the horses were fed, rubbed down, hobbled and left to graze, Rodregas unrolled Captain Poir‚Äôs mattress and collapsed into it with a welcome sigh.
 Sleep came to him almost instantly.
 In Rodregas‚Äô life he had experienced several very unpleasant ways of waking up, but this was the worst: a searing hot pain stabbed into his stomach!
 He reared up from his mat, but he felt hands holding him down onto the mattress.
 It was dark, but he could see in the dim light of the moon that someone was shoving a knife into his belly.
 He knew that in the next couple of seconds, his actions would decide his fate.
 He was bleeding, so he would be losing strength as well.
 Whoever his assailants were, they had him trapped.

As India‚Äôs Freedom Movement worked to awaken the population to the possibility of independence from foreign rule and its Green Revolution worked to awaken farmers to the possibilities of higher productivity, the future lies in awakening each individual in society to his or her own greater human potential.
 Chapter Seven of the Commission‚Äôs report examines some of the principal means at our disposal to enhance and accelerate the development of these human capacities.
 It called for efforts to re-examine our development experience over the past few hundred years in order to arrive at a deeper and clearer understanding of the process and principles that govern human evolution, individually and collectively.
 Since the publication of the report in 1994, ICPF‚Äôs successor organization, the International Center for Peace and Development, and The Mother‚Äôs Service Society in collaboration with the World Academy of Art and Science have worked to formulate a broader theoretical framework for understanding human development.
 Strategies arising from this approach were presented at international conferences co-sponsored with the Gorbachev Foundation in Moscow and with the Noor al Hussein Foundation in Jordan, and were effectively applied to stop hyperinflation in Yugoslavia.
 A full and conscious application of strategies arising from this framework can help to condense the period of transition of East European countries and the take-off of less developed countries from decades into a few years.
 From this perspective, the single most important agent of human development is not the institutions of government or those of private enterprise.
 It is the educational system that imparts to future generations the accumulated knowledge, skill and capacity acquired in the past.
 The quality of that education will determine the quality of the human beings who build our future world.
 Until now, too much emphasis has been placed on transfer of information from teacher to student, too little on the development of thinking and critical faculties by the student.

If she were to die, she would die fighting any way she knew how.
 The man in black paused, extended his hands, and began to cast.
 He would give her no chance to strike.
 A blade stabbed his side.
 Velixar whirled, his speed far beyond any mortal.
 He stepped past Felewen‚Äôs slash and slammed a hand against her chest.
 Dark magic poured in.
 Her arms and legs arched backward, her sword fell from her hand, and her mouth opened in a single, aching shriek.
 Bits of darkness flared from her mouth, her eyes, and her nostrils.
 Done, Velixar shoved her smoking body back into the alley and left her to die.

Britney had a piece of pizza, and looked like she was eyeing a piece of cake until she noticed I was trailing along behind her without a tray of my own.
 She actually sighed as she passed the cake.
 The urge to giggle was so strong I uncapped my water bottle and turned slightly to the side in an attempt to disguise my amusement.
 It was one of those moments I'd try to reconstruct in my head again and again.
 I think I must have heard the cash register till close, or maybe Britney said something.
 Whatever the reason, I took a step in her direction while still looking away, my bottle half raised, and ran into the biggest junior I'd ever seen.
 My clumsiness would've been embarrassing enough all by itself.
 Unfortunately my mostly-full bottle of water splashed all over both of us.
 I felt my cheeks go hot.
 Britney gasped and giggled.

 I watched as my new co-workers trickled out, and then looked around at the nearly empty room.

 "Let's go."
 I shook my head.
 "I told Mrs. Campbell I'd stay the whole time.

 Rachel piped up unexpectedly.

I just thought it was about Jesus and Elvis fighting ninjas.
 That would make a sweet comic book, the King of Rock and Roll and the King of Kings, battling ninjas and the forces of evil to save the world.
 They would need a jet, and some fancy gizmos, but man would it kick.

 Liz ‚Äì It doesn‚Äôt have a name, I just painted it for fun.
 It‚Äôs not about my parents or anything else.
 It might well have been since Mother really didn‚Äôt want that one in the show, but it has made a lot of people laugh, and the posters of it are selling well.
 Jim ‚Äì There are posters?
 I gotta get me one of those.
 Liz ‚Äì For you, it‚Äôs on the house, and I‚Äôll sign it as well.

Time seemed to slow as one of the other faery guys ran over to Seth and the one he was locked with.
 The faery raised one of the hilts of his sword and brought it down on Seth.
 It collided with his head and Seth dropped his sword.
 He crumpled to ground and didn't move.
 ‚ÄúSeth!‚Äù I screamed.
 He didn't move and one of the faery men reached down to grab him but I screeched, ‚ÄúLeave him alone!‚Äù and sent an arrow into the guy's neck.
 I heard Jason yell in rage and they started to drop like stones.
 Emily raised her arms and the ground shook under a faery.
 Roots twisted upward and wrapped around one of the five faery men that were left.
 The other four fell dead from my arrows and Jason's knives.

 Eugene ‚Äì Earlier this week at the arcade.
 Johnny ‚Äì How much money did you waste this time?
 Eugene ‚Äì It was money well spent.
 Jim ‚Äì But how much was well spent?
 Eugene ‚Äì Ten dollars.
 Johnny ‚Äì How long did you play for?
 Eugene ‚Äì I wasn‚Äôt playing.
 I was training.
 It was hard work.

 He prodded the prisoner up the roughly hewn stone steps none too gently with the butt end of the lit torch in his hand.

Amazingly enough, the satisfaction from having accomplished so much shielded me for most of the rest of the day.
 I withstood Britney's varied, mostly unsubtle, attempts to make me feel guilty for not spilling my guts about whatever big secret she thought I had, and even held up through the complete boredom that was Mr. Simms' class.
 It wasn't until I walked into Physics that I felt the cold hand of reality reach out and caress the back of my neck.
 Alec was uncharacteristically early, already sitting at his normal desk.
 He looked up and briefly met my eyes when I reached my desk, but there wasn't even a trace of acknowledgment in his gaze.
 Mrs. Alexander started class, reviewed a couple of points that other groups needed clarified, and then released us to work on our assignments.
 I waited several seconds for Alec to make some kind of move, and then with a flash of anger stood and carried my things over to the desk next to his.
 I nearly jumped when he opened his mouth.
 "You'll want to review page 89.
 It contains most of the relevant formulas.

A vine wrapped my shoulder, jerking me back.
 I was trapped.
 I looked to Ruby, but she could not help me now.
 Beyond her, a line of long flowing robes marched through the mist‚Ä¶ coming for us.
 The sight gave me strength, or courage, or blinding stupidity.
 I didn‚Äôt know, but I went with it with everything I had.
 I was trapped against the wall, unable to move, but there was one thing I could do.
 The sun broke through the clouds and I saw precisely what I needed.
 A shadow crossed the ground in front of us, a hawk flying overhead.
 The corner of my mouth pulled up in a smile as I closed my eyes to join him.

Taken to its extreme in the nuclear competition of the superpowers, it ‚Äòlogically‚Äô led to the astonishing doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD) as the cornerstone of national security policy.
 While there have been efforts by the West to claim ‚Äòvictory‚Äô in the Cold War and arrogate to itself the right to determine the post-war dispensation, in reality neither side won or lost, but a failed international security system was intelligently abandoned because it was extravagantly wasteful of resources, dangerously unstable and actively promoted violence in other regions.
 Failure to anticipate the future and to structure policies and instrumen talities to meet future needs has been the dominant characteristic of all previous attempts at forging an international security framework.
 Now, once again, there is a manifest tendency to forge a framework based on the supremacy of might, rather than right, and determined by the present balance of powers.
 This framework is likely to be even more tenuous and short-lived than previous compromises, because it ignores revolutionary forces that are reshaping the world for the twenty-first century.
 We now have the opportunity and responsibility to evolve a more flexible and far-sighted framework.
 This requires a fundamental shift in perspective, a new vision of global security.
 Clearly, the competitive security paradigm cannot provide a stable basis for global peace and security.
 A significant reduction in global military expenditure is a welcome development.
 Reducing the quantity and des tructive power of weapons arsenals will certainly reduce the actual and perceived risks of conflict.

And then, at once, the group began to scratch at themselves feverishly, clawing at forearms, abdomens, and necks.
 Each wore an uncomfortable, even frightened, expression as they hurried out of the room and into an inner Council chamber.
 I was considering the strangeness of it as I made my way through the now-vacant room, but was distracted by the sight of the library door.
 I had no way of knowing if there would be a protection spell on the entry.
 When I walked through, there were no obvious repercussions and I assumed that, with so many Council members around, they must not have thought it necessary.
 The Council library was overwhelming.
 It housed copies of all the books in the village library as well as hundreds more that were too delicate or important for public use.
 And if you believed Fannie‚Äôs theories, they held secret documents here as well, things they didn‚Äôt want commonly known.
 The walls were stark white, like carved marble, and the room felt cold and empty, despite the abundance inside.
 I found a shelf to hide behind and placed my pilfered documents on the floor.

‚ÄúTouch that book and you die,‚Äù I hissed.
 He froze, staring me straight in the eyes.
 I was fighting for control, struggling to find my thoughts.
 Then I saw it.
 He flicked a glance at Ruby and I knew.
 They knew.
 And it was all true.
 Suddenly, I couldn‚Äôt catch my breath.
 ‚ÄúPlease, Freya, stay calm,‚Äù Ruby pleaded.
 They were circling me, their arms outstretched as if to catch me‚Ä¶ or cage me.

She‚Äôd risked so much by coming here, to help me, to help my child.
 I would owe her.
 I had to stop reading as betrayal ripped through me again.
 Junnie.
 Ruby laid her hands on mine, which were trembling now, but I would not take the dust again.
 Tears streamed silently as I drifted, the ache in my chest only dulled by exhaustion.
 I felt weak when I woke, but I was silent about the pain as we continued the journey.
 Yearning to avoid my thoughts altogether, I spent much of the day in the mind of my horse.
 And the day passed.
 It was evening again when we stopped.

The smile that appeared on her face was tentative but genuine, and completely resolved my doubts.
 I returned her shy greeting with a smile of my own, and sat down at the table closest to her.
 Britney entered the tutor lab a few minutes later, and frowned at me before going over and sitting at the end of the room containing the jocks and cheerleaders.
 Apparently I was supposed to have waited?
 I sighed and flipped open my book.
 As I finished up my second assignment for the day, I realized I was parched.
 My trusty water bottle was empty when I reached for it, so I quietly stood and left the room.
 I thought I remembered where the closest drinking fountain was.
 Even so, I planned on getting a little lost before I found it.
 I didn't, however, plan on nearly colliding with Alec as he slowly rounded the corner in front of me.

Oh, Baudelaire and the Hashish Assassins.
 Funny guys.
 Sort of Memphis‚Äô answer to the Bonzo Dog Band.
 They were just goofing.
 Doing dope and making up this funny shit on stage, half monologue and half folk music.
 Had a song called ‚ÄúAbbie Hoffman meets the Roy Cohn Zombies.‚Äù (laughs)  They were too much for Memphis.
 I don‚Äôt know where they went.
 Their leader was a cat named, uh, Shlomo Stern.
 Writer, really.
 Did he ever publish?

‚ÄúI imagined what it was like to fight that creature.
 And then my body took over.‚Äù He explained, but I don‚Äôt think he even understood.
 Then he was gone again and the real Seth stood up.
 ‚ÄúTry it.‚Äù I closed my eyes and thought of school and all of Ms. Stecher‚Äôs homework that I needed to do.
 Then my body was doing the rest.
 I felt hot and cold, as the winds seemed to pick up.
 I shivered and opened my eyes.
 I was lying on the ground.
 My hair brown hair flopped in my face as I sat up, seeing Emily dash over to me.
 Seconds later Jason walked through the trees, rubbing his face.
