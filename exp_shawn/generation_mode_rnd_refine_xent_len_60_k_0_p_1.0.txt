It had been widely anticipated by foreign experts that this strategy would result in an immediate run on the country's foreign reserves and thereby a collapse of the new currency's foundation.
 Contrary to expectations, the initial months of the programme have yielded spectacular results.
 Inflation fell to zero per cent in the first week after the issue of the new currency and remained below one per cent during the first five months.
 Instead of a massive outflow of foreign currency through conversion of superdinars, people have rushed to cash in their foreign currency, resulting in a 60 per cent increase in the nation's reserves during the first three months.
 One of the most significant features of the programme has been its fair distribution of benefits and low social cost to the population.
 In contrast with the widespread outrage felt by Russian citizens over repeated episodes of demonetization and confiscation of household savings, the Yugoslav people have enthusiastically accepted the new currency as representative of a new deal for the poor and the working class.
 In addition, instead of the severe contraction of output experienced elsewhere, production rose by more than 100 per cent during the first five months, stimulating an increase in employment and demand for new investment.
 Real tax revenues have increased significantly.
 The astonishing initial success of the programme can be attributed to its balance and comprehensiveness, and to the following specific features: the government's recognition that stabilization was absolutely essential to economic recovery; the widespread public support for the programme, which was in large part due to the efforts to protect weaker sections from its harshest effects; the simultaneous relaxation of controls on industry; support for a natural rather than a forced process of privatization, based on the specific circumstances of each firm rather than on ideology; continued price supports for agriculture and a minimum wage for labour, which are crucial for maintaining food supplies and social stability; and rejection of import liberalization in order to protect domestic manufacturing against a major shock during the initial period of recovery.
 Possibly the greatest strength of the Yugoslav programme is that it was of necessity conceived by people within the country rather than by foreign experts, and depended entirely on domestic resources and capabilities for its accomplishment, rather than on pleas for foreign assistance.

My mother was also abused.
 She stayed, as so many abused women do, because her only options would only lead us back to poverty and uncertainty, and also because Dino threatened to take my little brother to Greece where she would never see him again.
 She protected us and herself as best as she could and she likely hoped for better days.
 Back then we didn‚Äôt have options as kids either.
 There were no toll free hotline numbers to call to safely report abuse and we knew better than to tell anyone what was happening behind closed doors.
 If we kept our mouths shut we would hopefully avoid making him even angrier.
 He weighed over 200 pounds and he could do some damage any way he beat us.
 The primary goal when getting beaten by a person nearly twice one‚Äôs size is to limit injuries and not escalate the violence because there is no winning.
 I had seen this tactic with my grandfather and my uncle, and my brother and I were now in a similar situation.
 When someone saw the marks or bruises on our bodies we lied so we didn‚Äôt get a repeat performance.

I found nothing but the horses, but I would take it.
 I left my body completely.
 My entry was so furious it startled the horse.
 I held him there, but when he raised his head from grazing, he was facing them.
 They were standing, kneeling, surrounding my limp body.
 I watched them, the horror on their faces, for an immeasurable moment.
 It was too much.
 It was all too much.
 A raw, unbearable ache crushed my chest and I gave in to it, accepted it.
 There was nothing else I could do.

But I forced those thoughts away, counting steps as I ran.
 I was miles from home.
 A home I might never return to.
 I pushed myself forward through the day, only stopping when I found a patch of sweet berries and a small, babbling creek.
 The berries were wild, small and much less palatable without the guiding hand of an elf, but the water I‚Äôd gathered from the stream was cool and refreshing.
 As evening approached, so grew the underlying discomfort with the idea of the coming darkness.
 Not that I hadn‚Äôt spent my share of time alone at home, just not alone in the middle of a strange forest outside.
 I might have run through the night and slept at day, but it made little sense to struggle out of fear.
 It didn‚Äôt stop me from seeking out a decent shelter before nightfall, though.
 Slowing my pace, I gave the surroundings more attention.

If you would like to share this book with another person, please purchase an additional copy for each recipient.
 Thank you for respecting the hard work of this author.
 Dedication I dedicate this book to my wife Lisa, the one person who has been with me through more ups and downs than anyone could ever imagine.
 You never know when or if the perfect person will appear.
 The fateful night I set eyes on her set in motion everything that would happen to me for the rest of my life.
 I couldn‚Äôt be happier that I was fortunate enough to be in the right place at the perfect time to meet my soul mate.
 She is the most beautiful person, both inside and out.
 She has been an inspiration for me and making her happy is the goal of my life.
 We are best friends, confidants, partners, and true lovers and together we are one.
 I can‚Äôt imagine my existence without her, and I know that everything I am and all I will become is shaped by her genuine kindness.

But, can I learn control now?‚Äù  Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù she responded.
 ‚ÄúBut it will probably be harder and slower than if you were learning earlier in life.
 It requires relearning something that is almost an instinct at this point in your life.
 Part of the problem is that the spell to activate the magic in the bow is just very different than anything you have probably done before.‚Äù Rodregas knew she was speaking the truth.
 He had never thought he was going to be some powerful mage.
 The fact that Doi‚Äôvan had so easily learned the spell just reminded him of how many times in his life he had failed to have the ability to succeed in things that he really wanted.
 Rodregas‚Äô new body was very gifted, but it was still mortal and some things he would just not be able to do as well as others.
 In some ways this was reassuring, a connection to his past.
 ‚ÄúCan I ask you a question?‚Äù she asked.

In fact he used to be a delightful dancer.
 His injuries were sustained at the hands of the individuals who killed Alec's father, the same ones who wanted to kill me, and who tortured Donovan for days before finally accepting that I'd died from the wounds that left me like this."
 Mallory shrugged, slowly and painfully in response to my questioning look.
 "My scars aren't readily visible, but they're there.
 That's why Alec is forced to come move the food he has sent to me.
 The scar tissue built up around my heart tends to pull in painful ways when my pulse starts racing.
 I tend not to worry about it all that much, but Alec fears it's a sign of deeper problems.
 I generally humor him and leave the heavy lifting for his visits, and we both pretend he doesn't know about the small garden I keep in a nearby cave."
 I opened my mouth, but just simply didn't know what to say.
 The horror of being trapped in a body that was riddled with old injuries was something thousands of people faced every day, but it seemed even more of a shame for someone who'd once been so vital and strong.

I‚Äôm thinking about reviving it.
 Because it was never really a Black Lung song.
 It was more personal, a statement of a kind.
 See, I was already moving away from the group before the group ever really got started.
 People have to understand.
 I‚Äôve always been a solo artist.
 I was held back by Black Lung.
 All that shit about he left his roots behind, he broke up a great band, etc.
 I mean, fuck that.
 It‚Äôs like Lennon, you know‚Äîhe was always a solo artist.

A quick spiral avoided the first wave.
 Dieredon clutched his bow and held on for dear life, his eyes locking on the man in black who stood perfectly still, his arms at downward angles from his body.
 The rest of the elves were in full retreat.
 He was the only one left.
 Qurrah watched Dieredon‚Äôs approach with a gnawing fear in his chest.
 It seemed no hand could touch this one, the horse possessing dexterity beyond what any creature that size should have.
 Velixar showed no sign of being aware of their approach.
 His eyes had rolled back into his head as he controlled the multitude of magical hands.
 ‚ÄúBe gone,‚Äù Qurrah said, firing several pieces of bone.
 All pieces missed.

Its green, silky beauty seemed to be mocking me.
 There was no way I was going to be able to pull off a dress like that.
 Even assuming it didn't fall off of me, I was still going to look like a walrus.
 "Stop fidgeting, Adri.
 It's just a dance, not a funeral, and if you don't hold still your makeup isn't going to turn out right."
 Rachel poked me in the ribs, and then went back to work on the last few details of my 'new and improved' look.
 I'd actually been trying to sneak a look in the mirror to find out how everything was shaping up, but it wasn't worth trying to explain.
 With the pall that'd descended over the pack once we'd made it back, it was almost certain she wouldn't believe me.
 Nobody even knew where we'd gone, but they'd keyed off of our mood faster than I would've believed possible.
 The results hadn't been good.

A few seconds later we were outside, traveling through the darkness with a breakneck speed that would've been suicidal with merely human vision.
 I was completely lost by the time we came around a corner and my inferior eyes were finally able to see the first hints of light up ahead.
 Alec slowed, to prolong the suspense as we got closer.
 Even so, it was only a few more steps before the grotto materialized out of the darkness before us.
 I'd thought it'd been breathtaking two weeks ago bathed in the light of the full moon.
 I'd been amazed at its lush beauty the couple of times I'd snuck back during the daylight.
 Neither of those compared to what greeted me now.
 Soft light came from dozens of floating lamps that'd been placed in the pool, all of which gave off an aching, white luminescence that seemed perfectly matched to the brilliant white of the rose petals scattered over the surface of the water.
 It wasn't until we got closer that I could make out the purple edging to the petals.
 "Lagrimas."

As we talk on the phone, he assures me that I am doing fine and I should continue to hold my position no matter how hard Ashley and Steve try to get me to go to their location.
 The attempt to move me is a tactic the narcotics‚Äô officers know well.
 The goal of the drug dealer will be to get me on his ground and on his terms.
 With so many officers surrounding me in a variety of cars, trucks, vans and on foot around the parking lot acting like patrons of the nearby stores, there is no way they could all uproot and follow me to some new location.
 Not to mention that marked police cars are waiting within striking distance of the retail center.
 I know the cops can hear everything I say so I spare them my nervous singing and limit my comments, fighting my compulsion to curse wickedly at them.
 I‚Äôm staring off across the wetlands, connecting with known drug dealers, talking to undercover narcotics officers on my personal cell phone, feeling a wire taped to my body and extending up to my neck, holding a bottle filled with one hundred Oxys in my jacket pocket.
 What brought me here?
 Where did things get so completely fucked up?
 Chapter 8: Boy Meets World I officially moved out of my parents‚Äô home when I was 15 years old, 35 years ago.

All agreed that no matter what might happen with the greater sigils that all should gain the minor Sigil of Healing.
 Its benefits to warriors and mages alike were well known.
 Jordaan agreed to do the inscribing and show the others the technique.
 In return Imeralda would inscribe Jordaan who was also eager for the sigil.
 Jordaan had his hand out with the palm facing up.
 At Jordaan‚Äôs direction Rodregas put his own, palm up, on top of it.
 The frog went on top and Jordaan‚Äôs other hand went on top of the frog.
 Jordaan then said, ‚ÄúThis is going to hurt, it will feel like someone is drawing a pattern under your skin with a knife.
 If you pull away before it is done, you will mess up the pattern and it will use up your magic without adding the benefits of the sigil.‚Äù As Jordaan finished speaking he looked in Rodregas‚Äô eyes until he nodded his understanding.
 He knew what was coming.

I couldn't form another coherent thought until he shook his head and looked away.
 "You need to see the nurse."
 My mind hiccupped for a second.
 There should be some kind of law requiring him to hide those things.

 "I'm fine.
 That wasn't anything; it didn't mean anything.
 Please put me down."
 I tried to put the right amounts of sincerity and confidence in my words, but I wasn't a very good liar.
 Something changed though because Alec slowed his ground-eating stride.

Adept Korin nodded politely and said, ‚ÄúYes, Master, the gods favor your desire to imitate their celestial glory.‚Äù Rodregas nodded back in acknowledgement and said, ‚ÄúAnd have you found any new bodies who you would like to‚Ä¶ take?‚Äù That question seemed to surprise him, but Korin smiled and said, ‚ÄúNo, Master.
 I have been too busy working on my studies.‚Äù Korin now looked at him with a surprised expression and an eyebrow slightly raised.
 Rodregas wondered if he had said something wrong.
 While he had seen the two interact for some years, he really did not know what was appropriate for him to say in such a circumstance.
 Rodregas knew that he did not have the skills for pretending he was a powerful Immortalist sorcerer, so he said, ‚ÄúHow many people have you killed during the past year Korin?
 And how many others have you raped or tortured?‚Äù he asked, trying to keep a calm voice.
 Now Korin looked very surprised and he started looking around.
 Rodregas saw that Korin noticed the study door, though he was working hard to not show it.
 ‚ÄúHow many?‚Äù Rodregas repeated his question.
 ‚ÄúI am not sure,‚Äù Korin said.

The boy who faced him was fair haired and smiling, seeming to relish the match.
 His stance was similar to Rodregas‚Äô own.
 Rodregas went slowly but steadily, keeping his guard up.
 The boy kept his hands up.
 When Rodregas went in low he took the blows to his body and went for Rodregas‚Äô face.
 Against another opponent it was the right move.
 Unfortunately for the boy, his blow seemed to come at Rodregas slowly.
 Rodregas easily dodged as he landed a strong blow to his opponent‚Äôs chest.
 Rodregas was used to sparring with Doi‚Äôvan and was surprised when his opponent went flying into the line of contestants and did not get back up.
 Rodregas waited a moment and then looked at the knight who stood outside the match.

 That your warmth and tenderness and thoughtfulness have made me dissatisfied with the man I'm supposed to marry.

Guards have been assigned to me.
 Like a prison.

 We only had a moment before I was torn away from her, yet I feel I got the message through.

 But I begged her to keep our secret, for her protection‚Ä¶
 And then several pages were torn from the diary before it continued.
 It was an accident.
 A product of her temper, her human emotions.

3.Economic strategy must be balanced: A market economy can be introduced gradually or step-wise, but it cannot be introduced in a fragmentary or piecemeal manner.
 Deregulation of prices was the most prominent feature of the strategy in most countries, because it was the easiest to implement.
 But under conditions of shortages in economies dominated by huge monopolistic enterprises, price deregulation led to skyrocketing prices and spiralling inflation.
 A market flourishes only when several essential conditions are met ‚Äì freedom of pricing, freedom of entry and exit from industry, free flow of information, unrestricted movement of goods and services, competition between enterprises, control of monopolies, and private ownership of property.
 The entire package of free market practices must be implemented hand in hand, otherwise it does not work.
 Freeing pricing without first regulating or dismantling monopolies, promoting privatization of land and enterprises, ensuring free flow of goods, and establishing wholesale markets and multiple distribution out lets lead to speculation, soaring prices, hoarding and falling production.
 Historically, the free market evolved over centuries in conditions of surplus production and stable currency, neither of which exist in Eastern Europe today.
 Efforts to accelerate the development of the market will have first of all to meet the political, legal, social and economic conditions historically required for its creation.
 And these conditions must be met simultaneously.
 4.Macro-economic stability is a precondition for increasing production: It is extremely difficult to increase production in a context of general macro-economic instability and hyperinflation.

They had grown fuzzy around their edges; it‚Äôs difficult to describe how they clung to each other in a desperate way as if they didn‚Äôt know where one ended and the other began.
 It was more than teenage passion driving them to that; it was dependence, an unhealthy co-dependence.
 They couldn‚Äôt meet anyone‚Äôs eyes; their pinpoint pupils darted around the room when I spoke to them.
 They couldn‚Äôt answer simple questions coherently.
 They babbled and told those outrageous stories.
 They were sick.
 When my wife and I heard sirens or the phone rang late at night, we always thought the worst.
 Certain police or crime television shows would give us lumps in our throats as we would silently look at each other and know we were thinking the same thing‚Ä¶ that might be our son.

They were fully armed and ready.
 The half-orc‚Äôs sister swords were sharpened and gleaming.
 Wrapped around his arm, Qurrah‚Äôs whip writhed hungrily.
 Their eyes rarely blinked, but as hour after hour passed and no blanket of shadow came to them, their patience wore thin.
 ‚ÄúThe human army is right outside the town,‚Äù Harruq grumbled.
 ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt wait until tomorrow night.‚Äù

Mighty pleasant work, which we‚Äôre both apparently competent at.
 According to the pre-natal calculations, our little girl--Zo√´ Ada Fox Kuhlken--got conceived during the week after Pam‚Äôs last exam.
 All my adult life, I have worked to support other people.
 I don‚Äôt mind day jobs or sharing what I earn.
 But my day job performance suffers when my mind veers off to the stories I want to get home and write, and I suspect my stories could be richer, more passionate and imaginative, more intuitive and maybe inspired, if they didn‚Äôt always get interrupted by my day job.
 Sure, Franz Kafka was an office worker and William Blake a printer, but Kafka didn‚Äôt live very long and Blake had no kids.
 Anyway, those guys were geniuses.
 Not me.
 So I worried, would the baby help squash my writer‚Äôs dreams.
 People heard I was going to be a father again and asked, "So how old will you be when the baby turns eighteen?"

Rodregas‚Äô fist stopped the squire‚Äôs struggles.
 He looked around and to his alarm he saw the last remaining squire running toward the hall with the shield.
 It was generally understood that you did not try to claim the shield until the last opponent was down.
 But, of course, the winner was simply the first to take the shield to the hall.
 Rodregas jumped up and ran, his arms pumping.
 He was almost as surprised as the armored squire with how fast he caught him and knocked him to the ground.
 This squire, though, thrust the shield at him and collapsed to the ground.
 Rodregas looked around the arena to make sure no one was left to fight and then headed into the great hall, carrying the shield of the tournament champion.
 As he walked the hallway into the main hearing chamber, knights stood along the walls.
 As Rodregas passed they all mumbled the same words to him, ‚ÄúWelcome to the Order my brother.‚Äù Several reached out and shook his hand or showed other signs of welcome.

He taught Eric to walk on his hands.
 He was good at making Eric laugh.
 I remembered him telling us that the toughest guys in our school were no match for wimps in his hometown.
 As if to prove that claim, at an annual signing party, while I was in the front yard trading insults with a couple of crashers, Tony came flying out of nowhere and knocked one of them into a flower bed, with a single punch.
 In Chicago, crime was a given.
 I arrived around midnight and walked from the downtown bus station to a nearby coffee shop upstairs from a basement nightclub.
 A policeman came and sat at the counter beside me, then a man from the nightclub showed and handed the policeman a fistful of money.
 The next day, after Tony‚Äôs parents stepped out for the evening, he showed me the shotgun his dad kept loaded in a closet.
 I found work a few blocks from Tony‚Äôs house, operating a punch press machine in a factory that made freeze plugs for Detroit.
 I called Bob in Omaha, and we made plans.

Now I was really wondering what I had walked in to.
 I labored to get my shoes off: A well placed moan and groan intended to prompt her curiosity.
 ‚ÄúAre you all right?‚Äù she asked, coming back into the room with a towel and spreading it flat onto the bed, then bending down and helping me untie my shoes.
 ‚ÄúI have back problems,‚Äù I said, standing to remove my dress shirt, exposing the back brace which I removed with angst.
 ‚ÄúHave your doctors given you anything for the pain?‚Äù she asked, helping my shirt off of each shoulder.
 I told her I had been given many medications, but I needed to be able to work my job so couldn‚Äôt take most of them.
 ‚ÄúI am a Financial Planner and I can‚Äôt afford to be loopy,‚Äù I said.
 ‚ÄúWhat kinds of stuff do they give you?‚Äù She pooched out her lower lip and tried to look more sad than excited.
 The conversation was headed quickly in the direction I had planned.
 I told her they had given me Vicodin, Darvocet and Oxycodone, which I definitely couldn‚Äôt tolerate.

A smile grew on his ever-changing face.
 ‚ÄúBeautiful,‚Äù Velixar whispered as the number of dead grew.
 Shifting sighs and mindless moans drifted from behind.
 Velixar glanced back at his companions, who now numbered in the thousands.
 ‚ÄúSurround the town,‚Äù he commanded them.
 The nearest nodded, the movement swinging the entirety of his rotting face.
 He moaned to the others, sending them in motion.
 The man in black extended a hand to his two disciples.
 ‚ÄúSend on their souls,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut leave the bodies for me.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid his tongue die with him?‚Äù Harruq asked.
 ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt told him he can speak yet,‚Äù Qurrah responded.
 His eyes flicked back from Harruq to the spirit.
 ‚ÄúYou may talk, spirit, but keep it quiet.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYou take my life, and now you dare keep me from eternity?‚Äù the spirit moaned.
 ‚ÄúFor what reason do you torment me?
 I have never harmed you, never said a cursing word, but now this?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúJust a few questions and you may return to your slumber.‚Äù
 Qurrah paused, a smile growing across his lips.
 ‚ÄúTell me, did you ever sleep with an orcish woman?‚Äù

If he remained where he was, he would be seen.
 He struggled to his feet and ran.
 More minutes passed.
 The glow of Woodhaven drifted behind him.
 Breathing was agony.
 Moving was torment.
 All his extremities grew cold and his head felt light.
 The pain in his shoulder threatened to send him into shock.
 It was just waiting for his body to succumb.
 His eyes searched for anything that could grant him cover.

"Oh?
 Are you leaving soon?"
 "In two weeks.
 Marie and I are going to spend three weeks there, and Jefferson and John will drive out on the weekends.
 You could come with them."
 Marie had been looking forward to going to the Cape, but listening to her mother talk about it, she wasn't so sure she was up to going.
 She needed the familiarity of home.
 She went up to her room soon after Tom left.
 She hadn't bought a stuffed animal for Rick's t-shirt, so she spread the shirt over a pillow.
 After she'd changed into a nightgown, she clutched his handkerchief in her fist and sat down in the rocking chair by her bed.

"More than I could have imagined."
 She closed her eyes, trying to hold back her tears.
 "So much that it hurts."
 "What does he look like?"
 Marie smiled, dabbing at her eyes with Rick's handkerchief.
 "He's gorgeous.
 He's very tall, and he has a broad chest and shoulders.
 His hair is light brown, and his eyes are blue.
 He's so gentle and sweet.
 He never kissed me unless I wanted him to, and whenever we did kiss--"  She shivered, glancing at her mother and then away.

What a time that was.
 Anyway, Carol was suddenly there.
 When I stepped off the stage between gigs there was Debbie with this blond young woman I‚Äôd never even noticed in the halls of Central High, so tuned out I was, so really out of the swim as far as high school was concerned.
 I mean, if I‚Äôd been paying attention I would never have missed Carol Warner.
 We even had a class together.
 (laughs)  Here‚Äôs this blond chick, in a loose shirt that I couldn‚Äôt help but look down at two lovely mounds of white white flesh, and a little jean skirt that showed off legs as thick as bedposts, strong, muscular legs‚Äîshe was on the track team, imagine that‚Äîand sweet Debbie, my first love, didn‚Äôt know what she was doing, introducing us.
 I mean she put the match to the fireworks and I think regretted it immediately.
 Apparently, Carol asked to meet me.
 Like a fan thing.
 But, man, it was love, lust, whatever, at first sight.

 Wake up!
 Now go to bed!
 I‚Äôll be along in a few minutes, and then we‚Äôll talk.
 Oh, I have a headache.
 (Character 1 cowers, and runs off stage hunched over)
 Character 2- (turns to the audience) And you, how many times have I told you to stop encouraging him.

"I'm not sure that's the best idea."
 The tears finally made their escape as I crumpled back onto the bed.
 "You're right.
 I'm so sorry to be such a bother."
 The words were broken by gasping sobs, but they were understandable, if only just barely.
 Alec's hand on my shoulder just made me try to roll away.
 I didn't want his pity.
 Not after everything else he'd already done for me.
 Guilting him into helping me more just felt wrong.
 He captured me in his iron grip, stopping me from getting up and running away.

I'll follow your lead, and try to look brave."
 He threw the door open and stalked into the house.
 Rachel grabbed my hand and pulled me along behind her.
 A group of familiar faces was waiting for us in the largest living room I'd ever seen.
 It took me several seconds to match identities to the rain-soaked group staring at me with such hostility.
 Jasmin was standing in the center, and didn't even wait for me to get fully in the room before she started talking.
 "She goes back to Brandon tonight.
 It's a long shot, but it's better than nothing.
 She brought it on herself so there isn't any reason to cry over what might happen."
 Alec shook his head.

I felt my eyes go wide at all the new terms, but kept my mouth shut because I was worried Rachel would clam up if I started asking questions.
 "I'm pretty sure Alec could take two of them, but not all three.
 They knew that, which was part of the reason they were pushing so hard."
 I felt shivers crawl up my spine, but what could someone say after something like that?
 Rachel reached over and gave me a hug.
 "Try not to think about it too much.
 Just remember that Alec's dominant to everyone here, and he'd die for either of us without even a heartbeat's worth of hesitation."
 After Rachel left I spent the next hour trying to get comfortable in Alec's desk chair.
 It was likely the discomfort was more due to the subject matter than the chair, but I just couldn't get comfortable.
 I finally moved my books over to the bed and sprawled out on it.

There was nothing holding me back.
 Nothing to do but this one thing.
 I spotted a small toad as it leapt across the clearing in a desperate attempt to escape the inferno.
 I concentrated on it, willing it to change.
 Its wide body started to swell, sides bubbling out, puffing it into a tiny green balloon.
 It did not transform into that monarch butterfly I had imagined.
 It burst, spewing entrails across the hem of my dress.
 My head fell into my hands as I groaned.
 It took a while, but the anger eventually faded to a point where I realized I‚Äôd need a new plan.
 I couldn‚Äôt help but regret the flames had consumed the documents that had caused all this to begin with.

Just as Sylvia‚Äôs bluster made people wrongly suppose she was a drunk, Richard‚Äôs stupefied expression made me suspect he was a junkie.
 Sylvia had a piano, the only treasure in a living room full of hand-me-down furniture.
 When Richard wasn‚Äôt plunking on it, weaving garrulous runs around the melodies of old standards, he gawked at TV horror movies.
 Eric, Sylvia, and I discussed religion and books.
 She attended no church but disdained atheists.
 Lord of the Flies she called propaganda by which teachers could argue the superiority of adults.
 Catcher in the Rye she applauded because Holden Caulfield appreciated jazz and was nearly as cynical as herself.
 She dismissed Nietzsche as a syphilitic blowhard.
 While we gabbed, Richard might eye us as though he had something to say.
 But the moment would pass, and he would turn back to gawk at the tube until Sylvia ordered him to fetch her cigarettes, or made him stand still while she straightened his tie, or checked to see that he had zipped all the way.

He said that last with his heart stopping blue eyes gazing directly into mine and I nearly stopped breathing.
 Somehow he hadn't realized yet that when he looked at me like that there wasn't anything I could deny him.
 "Ok, you can get me a present, something small and relatively inexpensive."
 Alec smiled and reached over to the backpack as he sat up.
 I let him pull me up and then felt my face freeze as he pulled out one of the largest velvet boxes I'd ever seen.
 "Alec, no."
 "It wasn't that expensive and you've already told me I could."
 "I didn't think you'd have something already ready and waiting to ambush me with.
 I thought I'd at least have a few days to prepare myself."
 He smiled again and I gingerly held my hand out.

Even if this magical book did exist that could help you raise the perfect child, I assume that the chapter titled, ‚ÄúHow to Do a Drug Bust for Your Son‚Äù would be absent.
 I knew Brandon couldn‚Äôt do this because he was too hot on the streets as a snitch.
 I pressed the issue, which was met with emphatic refusals each time.
 The officers continued to hold their ground and refused to agree to work with me.
 I pushed: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to work with me.
 I just want to know what you would do if I contacted you and told you that Steve was meeting me to buy one-hundred Oxys?
 What is your job responsibility in that case?‚Äù ‚ÄúWe would do our job if someone called and informed us of a drug deal,‚Äù Officer White said.
 ‚ÄúIf I am able to get Steve busted, would that count for my son‚Äôs deal?‚Äù I asked.
 The officer and his sergeant left the room for about ten minutes before returning to tell me that it would.
 ‚ÄúWe are not condoning or encouraging this in any way,‚Äù Officer White insisted.

 ‚ÄúHow long will that be?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúTomorrow morning,‚Äù she said.
 He raged and sputtered but could think of nothing to say or do.
 Finally, he started walking.
 ‚ÄúWhere are you going?‚Äù she asked him.

Most impressive, you two.
 An entire gram more than I would have ventured to risk myself, and done before anyone else.
 I thought the pair of you would make a great team."
 The easiest thing would have been to stay quiet and just let her believe I'd played an integral part of the project, but I didn't like getting credit for something I hadn't done.
 It was the worst kind of lying.
 "Mrs. Alexander, I didn't actually do any of it.
 I kept making mistakes."
 She chuckled so hard, for a second I thought the pencil behind her ear was going to fall out.
 "I rather suspect you're understating your accomplishments, my dear.
 Didn't contribute indeed.

Chevelle spoke to his guest and I groaned internally, wishing I‚Äôd heard their low voices earlier.
 Asher, as Chevelle had called the man, was apparently leaving.
 It sounded as if Chevelle was trying to persuade him in some way, but the man was short and cold in his responses.
 Quiet, too.
 I imagined he didn‚Äôt want me to hear them.
 Paranoia, my mind accused.
 I heard the front door close as I flopped onto the bed, only to jolt upright when Ruby‚Äôs door opened a few seconds later.
 It was Chevelle.
 My courage was gone again.
 He seemed to be waiting for me to speak.

I could see his handsome face smiling at me now, trying to coax me up into the tree with Cindi.
 The vision lasted only as long as it took me to hit the floor.
 I could always judge how long I'd been out by my mom's expression when I came to.
 That and whether or not I'd seriously injured myself on the way down.
 She looked concerned, but not desperate yet.
 Her cell phone was in her hand, but not yet flipped open.
 It probably hadn't been more than eight or nine minutes.
 "Adri, what just happened?"
 She knew already, the psychiatrist had some fancy name for it complete with a whole list of symptoms and psychobabble garbage.
 It all boiled down to the idea that the more Mom could get me to talk about it, the sooner I'd shake off the fainting spells.

 He hugged her again.

 Last night it had occurred to him that she might feel more inclined to stay in 2011 if she had friends here.
 "All right."
 She looked up at him.
 "Are you going to tell her about me?"
 "What do you mean?"

The night came when the father was taken for the ceremony.
 Rodregas was on guard duty when Korin came down in his new body.
 The poor lad had stared at the man who had been his father, saying nothing, but tears ran down his cheeks.
 The apprentice Immortalist had then proceeded to rape the mother.
 The Adapt was rough and the act was violent and Korin, in his new body, clearly enjoyed the violence more than the sex.
 After he had finished with the mother, he had the guards release the boy who had run over to his sobbing bleeding mother.
 In a fatherly gesture Korin had kissed the boy on the cheek and, wrapping his hands around the boy‚Äôs head in a slow loving gesture, made a quick yank and broke Join‚Äôs neck.
 The next day the guards released the young AElfin widow.
 Rodregas had helped drag her beyond the gates.
 She lay there not moving, limp though alive; she was dead in every way that mattered.

"That was some kind of promoter.
 She wants me to go out and shoot a fashion show in Paris.
 For a week and a half, and then another one in Italy.
 I've never heard of either of the shows, but she's offering me twenty thousand dollars for just three weeks."
 I felt my eyes go wide at the idea of something so unbelievable happening to us, and then even wider as I realized this must be what Alec had been referring to.
 'Convince her it's fine for her to leave' indeed.
 He hadn't been kidding about getting us out of the country.
 "Mom, you have to go!
 This is the biggest opportunity ever!"
 She looked doubtful.

By the time English ended, I felt worse, albeit for different reasons than earlier in Biology.
 Luckily, Algebra was starting to become a real sanctuary.
 The fact that we had a test made everyone even more focused than normal.
 Considering how on-task and busy Mrs. Campbell normally kept the class that was a feat in and of itself.
 I scanned through the first problem, and then picked up my pencil and got started.
 Having successfully finished my test with ten minutes to spare, I expected lunch to bring more of the same kind of anxiety that I'd just managed to push out of my mind.
 It was headed that way.
 Despite Britney's best efforts to distract me with a point-by-point analysis of what was going on with someone named Sandra, and the two boys she'd been leading on for the last month.
 I followed Britney through the lunch line, gripping my meal replacement drink with both hands.
 We sat down at our usual table, only to be surrounded a few seconds later by an energetic mob of familiar-looking people.

 ‚ÄúSteed was certainly enjoying it, but, my dear, he won‚Äôt spill the secret to me.

 There was nowhere to go, it was too much, and it turned to fury as she continued.
 I snapped.
 The flames that had been coursing through me burst in my hands.
 She laughed and tossed her head.

Rodregas waited as Doi‚Äôvan touched the handle but stopped him before he opened it.
 ‚ÄúDo you see anything?‚Äù he asked.
 Imeralda eyes opened wide when Doi‚Äôvan fully opened the doors and revealed the room.
 It was in style identical to the first room of the Celestial Beasts except instead of great beasts on pedestals, it held crouching daemons in pits.
 The previous vague smell of brimstone and hellfire wafted fully into the room.
 Doi‚Äôvan and Rodregas stepped into the room but paused when Imeralda did not follow.
 He looked back and she looked confused, squinting as if the room was not fully illuminated by the glowing daemons in their pits.
 ‚ÄúCan you not see into the room?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúNo, I can see something, shapes flicking in fire?
 I think I smell something like rotten eggs, but I can‚Äôt see well enough to go in.

I got more than friendly with Gloria Valenciana, who was down from Los Angeles camping with her family.
 Her dad made her turn in early.
 When I joined Eric at our campfire, I asked him why he didn‚Äôt seem interested in girls.
 ‚ÄúHalf of my friends are girls,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúYou know what I mean.
 Don‚Äôt you get horny?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúOnly, for me, it‚Äôs too soon.
 I‚Äôve got a bunch more to learn.‚Äù The last couple months of that summer, while I smashed golf balls, played baseball in Mexico on Sundays, and visited my cousins in Pacific Beach, Eric ran around with Margaret Beasley, Pam Greenman, and Lane Campbell.
 Margaret had been my friend longer than anyone except my cousins.

I hadn't heard Mrs. Campbell approach from behind me, and for a second worried she was really angry, but the way Albert chuckled as he cringed in mock fear alleviated my concerns.
 Albert pushed his glasses a little ways back up his nose, and then wandered off to help the next person with a red card face up on their desk.
 The number of people who proceeded to come into the tutoring lab was nothing less than amazing.
 Based on overheard conversations, it sounded like there was a perfect storm of tests.
 Both of the other math teachers were apparently having tests in every single one of their classes, and Mrs. Campbell was having tests in a couple of hers as well.
 The resulting number of questions kept us all jumping.
 I started work half an hour early, and Albert, Peter and Mrs. Campbell all stayed an extra forty-five minutes.
 I was helping out an undersized freshman who was having a really hard time understanding the fundamental concepts of the unit she was going to be tested over tomorrow when Mrs. Campbell stopped by.
 "We're all done.

It was stuck like that for hours.
 I laughed so hard I kept having to wipe the tears from my eyes.
 She tried to yell at me and it came out, ‚ÄúThut uhp!
 Thop iht!‚Äù Which made me laugh harder, and she got so mad she screamed and busted a bunch of glass.
 I kept reading, enthralled.
 It seemed to be a journal, written by a girl, but I had no idea who.
 Chevelle‚Äôs family?
 Why would he have a young girl‚Äôs diary?
 It was filled with pointless stories as far as I could tell, but after a few pages the writing matured and it seemed to jump several years.
 I wished it was dated.

I relaxed, too; fine being better than anything I‚Äôd thought in a long while.
 Chevelle stayed in the front room that night, watching through the small windows.
 When I closed my eyes, I could see the glint of swords making patterns as they crossed again and again.
 Ruby‚Äôs hummed tune was sad, the sound drifting through the walls between us as I fell into an easy sleep.
 Chevelle and Ruby‚Äôs voices, low and confrontational, woke me.
 I rubbed my tired arms as I rose to join them in the front room.
 ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I asked, though I could tell by their exchange they‚Äôd been arguing.
 Ruby grinned at me.
 ‚ÄúJust planning for the trip.‚Äù ‚ÄúTrip?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, you know, to the peak.‚Äù She was scheming.
 ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù I decided I‚Äôd let them work it out, heading instead to Ruby‚Äôs room.

He wasn‚Äôt going to scream.
 Or talk.
 His back twisted and he fell, a motionless heap on the ground.
 His body was bent out of recognition.
 It was over.
 My ears had stopped ringing the moment he‚Äôd hit the ground.
 Ruby relaxed and stepped away from me.
 I wanted to catch up with what had happened but no one was talking, the mountain was silent.
 Rhys and Rider were once again gone from sight.
 ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you going to perform the death ceremony?‚Äù I worried as the other elves began walking away.

"The story's vague enough that nobody can really prove or disprove it.
 Don't get specific on any details, and you can ride this all the way until you graduate."
 The mask was gone, she wasn't lying anymore.
 She really believed this rumor would change everything for the better.
 It all made sense, but didn't explain who'd started it, or why they'd done it.
 Rachel's face told me she wouldn't answer either of those questions.
 I finally settled on one I thought she might answer.
 "Why are you telling me all this?"
 Rachel's face tried to take on her liar's mask, but didn't quite succeed.
 "You risked a lot to stop Cassie from hurting me.

Praise, love, adore, perhaps even admire or commiserate with someone, God joins in.
 Condemn, I‚Äôm on my own.
 So, I have found a new rule to live by: the more I criticize or judge, the less the Holy Spirit cares to hang with me.
 Who could blame her?
 When the traffic spreads out, I find time to think about the story I heard at Chapter‚Äôs Books, and about how I would answer God if he told me to ditch Zo√´.
 The first words that come to mind are, ‚ÄúGet lost, please.‚Äù I listen to my I-pod until a song reminds me, if I hope to achieve the peace Brother Lawrence lived in, I need to surrender.
 I think about Olga's poem and begin to doubt I should pray those words.
 After all, Olga had no kids.
 If God asked me to surrender Zo√´, not just deliver her into his care in some spiritual sense, but say to give her up, send her to live with her mother or grandma, I believe I would rescind any surrender pledge I had made.
 Meaning I‚Äôm probably light years from honest to God surrender.

She watched as the actors climbed towers, rode hand trolleys on cables, jumped from shattered platforms into the water.
 And when the heroine shot the villain, causing his jacket to catch on fire, Marie screamed.
 It was so real, and she gripped the edge of her seat as she waited to see what would happen after he fell into the water.
 The villain jumped up on the platform to make his bows with the rest of the cast.
 Marie raised wide eyes to Rick's face as they stood to leave.
 "Was that man who was on fire hurt?"
 "No.
 He'll do another show in a couple of hours."
 "How do they do that?"
 "The jacket is made out of some kind of special material."

And looking up to us.
 We were teenagers and we had these other guys, girls, coming up to us, asking about Dickinson and what I meant by ‚Äúhoodoo on the bloody muddy‚Äù or some shit, something they heard on the album.
 It was weird.
 But, you know, I was kind of lost at that time‚Äîthis was right before Lor came into my life‚Äîand I had all these groupies, all these chicks, and I‚Äôd ball them, right?, but really I‚Äôd be thinking about the music, about what‚Äôs next, musically, about soloing, about getting my axe to sound like a sax.
 I was way gone on the music, man, and it just shoved everything out of me, everything else.
 I didn‚Äôt know then, that I was unraveling, like an old sweater.
 I mean, I loved the chicks, you know, I loved them.
 But, they knew I was nowhere man, after we‚Äôd do it and I‚Äôd be lying there, I‚Äôd be a million miles away and they‚Äôd get this sad look.
 In the morning they‚Äôd be all like, let‚Äôs go to Barksdale‚Äôs for breakfast, and, well, I was using some speed at the time and my appetite was nil.
 So, they‚Äôd go off and I‚Äôd pick up the guitar.

Her cheeks were golden and rosy, her long, dark lashes like fans against them.
 Her dark hair fell over his arm and onto the pillow, and he reached up with his free hand to caress it.
 Marie stirred, moving closer to Rick.
 She blinked and found him hovering over her.
 As she gazed up into his eyes, she felt as if she were in a dream.
 This was just like one of her fantasies.
 Except that he was wearing a shirt.
 "You fell asleep," he whispered, his face moving closer to hers.
 "Yes."
 "Me too."

So this wasn‚Äôt our destination.
 Or did he mean back to the village?
 He continued, apparently not noticing my perplexed expression as my mind ran through a list of possible scenarios.
 ‚ÄúThe pouch from the vault.
 There was a stone in it.‚Äù It was clear he was asking for the ruby, but I wasn‚Äôt sure why.
 I didn‚Äôt think I had much choice in the matter, given that I was a criminal, but could come up with no real reason to fight it.
 Standing in the center of this strange room, in the middle of a mountain, had me thinking through fog.
 I was going to be returned to the village for punishment‚Äîor worse, now that I was being tracked by Grand Council.
 I was completely ignorant of where I was.
 I had apparently lost part of my memories and magic because I had been bound, was still bound.

‚ÄúIt is your servants that should bow to you,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúAnd one could not ask for a more gifted disciple.‚Äù
 Qurrah stood but kept his head bowed.
 Harruq shifted on his feet, scared and confused.
 The eyes of his brother‚Ä¶‚Äåtears?
 ‚ÄúThank you, my master,‚Äù whispered the half-orc.
 ‚ÄúI have never felt more honored.‚Äù
 Velixar placed a hand atop Qurrah‚Äôs head and accepted the tears he knew the half-orc tried to hide.
 He had long thought the weaker emotions fled from his soul, but that night he felt an overwhelming sense of pride.
 ‚ÄúHarruq,‚Äù Velixar said, his normally unshakable voice faltering.

‚ÄúThis is no healing potion,‚Äù Dieredon said.
 He threw the vial.

 Velixar snarled as holy light of the elven goddess burned his decaying flesh.
 After a few seconds, the light vanished.
 Velixar glanced about, seeing no sign of the elf.
 ‚ÄúNo matter,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúCome my minions.
 It is time to hunt.‚Äù
 He spread his hands wide and let all of his power flow freely.

I know they are both addicts and I know the boyfriend, Steve, is a big time Oxy dealer, selling it faster than he can get it.
 I also know that his girlfriend, Ashley, sells her young body‚Äîhe demands it‚Äîto pull her own weight in this sick relationship anchored in addiction.
 I know this because I‚Äôve hired her.
 I look straight ahead at the entryway to this shopping center which is a narrow bridge spanning over the wetland preserve.
 A light fog hovers above the shallow water and dissipates into the cattails that line its shore.
 It is getting darker by the moment, but my eyes have adjusted and I can clearly see the cars that cross.
 I eliminate them as they drive past.
 I am looking for one of two cars I believe they will be driving.
 Will it be the red Dodge Charger or the white Lexus sedan or perhaps a complete surprise?
 One way or the next, they know where I am and what I am driving and exactly where I am parked.

Five weeks and two days.
 And they had no idea what had happened to her.
 "I love you, sweetheart."
 She smiled, his words bringing her out of her reverie.
 Yesterday he'd told her he loved her more times than he had the previous four or five days combined.
 And that was saying a lot.
 He hated having to go to work this morning.
 What if, now that he was trying so hard not to think about anything in 1927, his mind wandered to it?
 He knew he wouldn't be able to bear it if he went home and found that she had disappeared.
 After nearly four hours of trying to concentrate on his work, he gave up and told his secretary that he wasn't feeling well and was going home.

 It seemed like I couldn‚Äôt quite catch my breath anymore.
 Reaching inside to draw out the long white gown, I could not fathom Junnie‚Äôs reasoning.
 But she must have gone through much to get me this package.

I had stayed in contact with Officer White by e-mailing him updates on Brandon‚Äôs progress as a courtesy to him and as a bit of a reward.
 I thanked him for busting my son.
 Brandon entered rehab about a month after I did the bust so he wasn‚Äôt on the streets for long after it all came crashing down.
 I think without the bust, he could have got killed for stealing from other drug dealers or been captured in a larger bust that he couldn‚Äôt negotiate his way out of.
 I knew through our exchange of e-mails that most times he busted someone they ended up repeating the same behavior eventually ending up in prison or dead.
 After getting to know the officer I began to realize he was never a bad guy at all as he was just doing a thankless job, often with grim results that left him feeling like his was a fruitless effort to cleanse the streets of dealers and addicts.
 When I contacted Officer White and invited him and his Sergeant to meet Brandon and me for coffee he quickly agreed.
 The officers were amazed at how healthy Brandon looked and how mature he acted.
 Brandon greeted them with a handshake that turned into a hug.
 He thanked them.

It said, I‚Äôve been hurt bad and know how it feels so I‚Äôll be nice to everybody and try not to make anybody else feel that way.
 A thousand and some miles from home, I was lonely enough to once again ache for a best friend.
 So while I admired this barmaid, who looked about three months pregnant, I dreamed she and I would roam until we discovered the right small town, where we didn‚Äôt know anybody.
 There she could leave behind the sorrow of getting ditched by the creep who knocked her up.
 I meant to love her baby like my own.
 But on the third evening, not long after she had sat with me and chatted in a dovelike voice about strange and outrageous visitors to the bar, a guy with several tattoos came for her.
 As she walked out with him, she waved goodbye to me.
 Earlier that day, I had noticed a Kitchen Help Wanted sign in a coffee shop.
 Since I hoped to become an instant father, in order to show the waitress my responsible side, I inquired about the job.
 The manager said, ‚ÄúNot your kind of work.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù I asked, and explained that I had enjoyed last summer washing pots in a similar establishment.

How could he put doubt in her mind about her fianc√© and then-then .
 .
 .
 try to seduce her?
 He loved her and desperately wanted to make love to her, and her response to him was passionate and unrestrained.
 But she was confused--he knew that.
 And he knew that she was a virgin.
 He'd felt her initial hesitation when he'd tried to coax her lips apart, felt the shock go through her body when his tongue had touched hers.
 The fact that she'd found the kiss exciting didn't change the fact that she was an innocent.
 Or that she was far from home.

 "Why didn't you marry him?"
 Mrs. Tranton's face sobered.
 "He died.
 He drowned trying to save his little cousin."

Peace and democracy can provide only the foundation for stable and productive social life, not its fulfilment.
 For that, political security has to be complemented by economic security and a blossoming of individual and cultural potentials.
 Yet here our optimism seems to flag.
 Our thoughts of the new millennium do evoke images of greater peace and stability internationally, more individual freedom and democratic rights, growing international co-operation, exciting new technologies, increasing cultural interaction.
 But they also evoke images of more people and less work ‚Äì meaning fewer jobs!
 No sooner has the threat of nuclear annihilation receded, than the spectre of chronic unemployment and unrelenting poverty has risen to replace it, giving renewed justification to humanity‚Äôs deepest anxieties by transferring them to a new source of apprehension.
 In recent years, unemployment has emerged as a major cause of concern for governments around the world.
 In industrial countries, the subject evokes pessimistic prophecies of a fast-approaching future in which tens of millions of people will never find jobs, technology eliminates the need for human labour, cheap imports replace domestic jobs, welfare systems collapse under an unbearable burden, children have less economic opportunity than their parents, a widening abyss divides the rich and poor, and both markets and governments are powerless to do anything about it.
 In developing countries, it dashes hopes of ever conquering hunger, eradicating wide spread rural and urban poverty, and bridging the gap that separates these nations from the prosperous West.
 The very same deterministic mentality that until recently made us feel that a nuclear war was inevitable now leads many to conclude that rising unemployment, chronic poverty and social alienation are unavoidable.

There really are things that aren't safe for you to know.
 Among them, the reason why it isn't safe for you to know them."
 I waited expectantly, and he finally resumed.
 "To answer your question, I wasn't always like this.
 When I was younger I saw exactly the way that you do.
 Even now, my vision is more like yours when I'm in this form.
 I still see incredibly well, and there's just the slightest hint of light from living things, but nothing like what you saw in the dreams."
 "So you work from memory mostly then?
 That and trying to make what you see when you're in human form even more drab than what you really see?"
 "That about sums it up, although I didn't really expect you to pick up on that last part so quickly.

unless I know they truly care about me."
 He turned to her, reading trust and honesty in her eyes.
 Without a word he slid his arms around her, burying his face in her neck as he hugged her.
 She coaxed him into the water, where they swam and floated on gentle waves.
 He stayed in until his stomach was rumbling loudly enough to frighten the fish, and then he convinced Marie to leave the water by promising her a hot dog.
 It was a treat she rarely had.
 So he bought her one with the works, along with onion rings and a Sprite.
 She'd never had either of those two, and she sighed and rolled her eyes as if she were feasting on ambrosia.
 Since she'd had Coke but never heard of Sprite, he assumed that Sprite hadn't been invented by 1927, but he wondered if maybe the fact that she'd never had onion rings was due to her social class.
 Times had definitely changed where food was concerned.

Father has increased my work periods to every other day.
 Combined with my other duties, I am stationed in the castle almost all week.
 The magic practice exhausts me or I would sneak out at night, the way I enjoyed as a child.
 It doesn‚Äôt seem fair.
 My sister is practically ignored.
 Father clearly prefers me, but sometimes I wonder if that is really better.
 She wanders idly around the castle, no practice, no duties, no formal gatherings.
 Magic practice, castles, who was this girl?
 I read the entries for hours.
 Ruby must have thought I was sleeping.

By the time I was near surfacing I no longer remembered just how much I'd wanted to stay.
 Britney was pacing back and forth when I opened my eyes.
 She had her cell phone out and was looking like she wanted to dial 911, but was worried about the possible fallout.
 I was on the ground, which for some reason made me more irritable than it should have.
 Didn't she realize how hard it was to make it over to someone before collapsing like that?
 It kind of defeated the whole point if they then put you on the ground where your clothes would take their normal, instantaneous-collapse beating.
 "Oh my gosh, are you okay?
 I wasn't sure what to do."
 "I'm okay, I just need a minute."
 Since I was already on the ground, I really did just want to lie there for a moment, scorpions, dirt and all, but Britney didn't seem to understand that concept.

 ‚ÄúHow about ‚Äògun, gun, he‚Äôs got a fucking gun‚Äô‚Äù?
 I asked.
 ‚ÄúHow about, ‚Äò there‚Äôs no need for guns,‚Äô‚Äù the officer countered.
 This was an unexpected instruction and a situation I hadn‚Äôt realistically contemplated.
 I was all wired up and the officer flattened his hand out and tapped on my truck‚Äôs windowsill to illustrate how low they wanted me.
 ‚ÄúYou get here in the crossfire.‚Äù He bent me down behind my drivers‚Äô side door.
 ‚ÄúYou stay here.
 No moving around.‚Äù He told me that in the case of a weapon, they would come in from both sides of the truck with their guns drawn.
 The shooting officers would be on the driver‚Äôs side firing over my head.

Launch a nationwide programme to implement all employment-related strategies on a highest priority basis.
 Comprehensive Strategies
 While most of the prescriptions listed above are known to all, very few are systematically and efficiently applied.
 Africa can benefit enormously by applying strategies that have worked in Asia.
 The ‚ÄòProsperity 2000‚Äô programme evolved by ICPF for India and presented in the next chapter seeks to utilize a combination of these strategies to generate 100 million new jobs within a decade or less, which will be sufficient to raise 25 per cent of the world‚Äôs poorest billion people above the poverty line.
 Given a comprehensive approach, the right mix of policies, good government and a conducive international environment for trade, technology transfer and investment, every nation has the capacity to develop and meet the employment needs of its people within the next one or two decades.
 The Right to Employment
 The transformation of social life in this century has drawn hundreds of millions of people away from a subsistence level existence in agriculture to urban areas and industrial employment.
 In the process it has brought about an unprecedented advancement in living standards around the world.
 But it has also engendered a way of life in which the livelihood of individuals is far more dependent than in the past on external conditions ‚Äì the state of the national and global economy, trade policies, interest and exchange rates, levels of military spending and overall consumer demand.

At first it seemed like things changed up on a daily basis.
 Then Jasmin manifested her royal wolf form and things settled down a little."
 We were venturing into unknown territory for me.
 Alec was usually so careful to keep me sheltered from his world.
 "Was Jasmin dominant then?
 I mean if she was a royal wolf and you hadn't manifested your hybrid form yet did she win all of the fights?"
 Alec rested his cheek on the top of my head.
 "Not exactly.
 If she'd been a little more heartless she probably could have killed me and cowed the rest of the pack.
 Even then though, it was becoming pretty clear that we couldn't have two separate packs in such close proximity.

"I'm not going to have them wake us up.
 Just come knock on my door whenever you get up."
 "OK."  She smiled up at him dreamily.
 "This evening has been like a fairy tale.
 Even if we left tomorrow, I'd be happy."
 "Good."
 He stroked her cheek with one finger.
 "That's all I want."
 Her heart began pounding when she realized he was going to kiss her goodnight.
 His lips were light, almost teasing, as they touched hers.

CM:  	And, that‚Äôs just you and your guitar.
 BG:  	Right.
 Actually, recorded here at home, right over there, in the corner by the bookcases.
 I set up a mike in the corner, turned my back to the room, and used the wall of books as organic echo, a trick, I‚Äôm sure you know, that Robert Johnson employed to get his idiosyncratic vocal style.
 CM: 	No, I didn‚Äôt know that.
 BG:  	Oh, yeah.
 That‚Äôs the story, anyway,  He turned away from the engineer in the studio there and faced the corner, like Little Jack Horner‚Äîas a matter of fact, I almost called this ‚ÄúLittle Jack Horner,‚Äù but it didn‚Äôt make much sense.
 Anyway, everyone thought the poor guy was just shy, or hiding his idiosyncratic playing style‚Äîwhich may be partly true‚Äîbut the real reason, so I‚Äôve read, is that he could get an interesting ‚Äúbounce‚Äù from the corner, sort of double-tracking his voice before that was ever heard of.
 So, I laid it down first just on this cassette player‚Äîreally‚Äîand then dumped it to a 16-track, played through a little reverb amp I had at the house.
 Stayed up all night doing that fucker.

If they found out what had happened at Raven Keep there was not much chance for Rodregas‚Äô survival.
 After a simple meal, a good rub down for the horses and a few hours of rest, Rodregas got the wagon back on the road.
 If he could keep up this pace, up he could be well hidden before any forces could find him.
 At the end of the second day, before he had come to his last turn off, he realized that he would have to get some sleep.
 He was feeling exhausted.
 His body might be surprisingly strong and quick but apparently it still needed to sleep on a regular basis.
 As soon as the horses were fed, rubbed down, hobbled and left to graze, Rodregas unrolled Captain Poir‚Äôs mattress and collapsed into it with a welcome sigh.
 Sleep came to him almost instantly.
 In Rodregas‚Äô life he had experienced several very unpleasant ways of waking up, but this was the worst: a searing hot pain stabbed into his stomach!
 He reared up from his mat, but he felt hands holding him down onto the mattress.

‚ÄúHow were the greater sigils created?‚Äù Rodregas wondered.
 While the leaser sigils appeared to be simple sculpture empowered by magic, these truly appeared real.
 Yet what magic could capture such powerful beasts for the use of creating sigils?
 Had the greater sigils been gifts to mortals from the Gods themselves?
 Rodregas yearned to reach out and touch to see if they felt like flesh or stone.
 But, to do so would set his path for the rest of his life.
 If he was truly strong enough for two as Imeralda thought, then he could be a lion and what else?
 ‚ÄúWell, Doi‚Äôvan, what do you think?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúI am going to choose lion, but it would be great to have a pride, or maybe the Moon Wolf or the Mountain Bear.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan nodded and walked over to the bear.
 It was a kind of bear that Rodregas had not heard of in the mortal world, even larger than ‚Äòhis‚Äô lion.

I in fact happen to know that you're in a band that performs occasionally down in Vegas, so don't go trying to pull a fast one on me."
 Albert looked genuinely startled, but recovered quickly.
 "Hey there, idle, profoundly-untrue comments dropped by Mrs. Campbell in passing conversation don't count.
 I'm absolutely not a member of Fatal Angst."
 "Yes, you are, at least you are until I either decide to dispose of your body, or let your little secret out of the bag because you're not doing your job."
 I hadn't heard Mrs. Campbell approach from behind me, and for a second worried she was really angry, but the way Albert chuckled as he cringed in mock fear alleviated my concerns.
 Albert pushed his glasses a little ways back up his nose, and then wandered off to help the next person with a red card face up on their desk.
 The number of people who proceeded to come into the tutoring lab was nothing less than amazing.
 Based on overheard conversations, it sounded like there was a perfect storm of tests.
 Both of the other math teachers were apparently having tests in every single one of their classes, and Mrs. Campbell was having tests in a couple of hers as well.

I'd seen the type before in Minnesota, girls who have a perfectly acceptable figure, but who throw money into their wardrobes, makeovers and accessories in an effort to achieve the cutting-edge look, when they'd be much better off just picking outfits that didn't try to compete with the anorexic-looking beauty queens.
 A surprisingly adorable-looking nerd in jeans and a tee-shirt ducked out of our way, and I felt a pang of sympathy.
 He was the kind of boy Mom pointed out when she surfaced from one of her projects.
 She hadn't ever managed to really pique my interest in any boy, but I could see how a few years from now, he'd probably be fairly popular among college girls.
 Britney stopped before one of the top lockers and started spinning the tumbler.
 She was still relating some story about her old school, but suddenly I couldn't hear a word.
 The crowd of students had drifted to the sides of the hall, like worshipers making way for a pair of pagan gods.
 Even so, there still wasn't quite room for them to walk side by side.
 The girl was leading.
 Her dark, wavy hair and flawless skin would've made her pretty in any crowd, but she also had perfectly symmetrical features and one of those bodies that required hours each day in the gym to maintain.

I would be handcuffed against the truck or on the ground and lead to a separate patrol car.
 Oh boy, the handcuffs I had successfully avoided most of my life were finally finding their way on my wrists.
 ‚ÄúAfter you have the cash and they have the pills, tell ‚Äòem you‚Äôre going to head to Tahoe.
 That will be our signal.‚Äù I could handle that.
 When I was given the shots fired and weapon instructions, I realized that desperate druggies rob guys like me.
 The officer began to explain what I was to do if this turned out to be a robbery.
 Apparently, this Steve was known to carry a weapon and he was known to come up a little short on cash for drug deals and if the seller wasn‚Äôt willing to accept the lower amount, he might brandish his weapon.
 If he pulled the gun or a weapon of any sort, the officers needed me to indicate that.
 ‚ÄúHow about ‚Äògun, gun, he‚Äôs got a fucking gun‚Äô‚Äù?
 I asked.

Rodregas decided to pull his short swords from the harness on his side and, at the same time, rush in on the big guy.
 The large attacker was big and powerful, but his rake had shattered and Rodregas had his short swords on his harness.
 His attacker appeared to not have a back up weapon.
 Then a voice rang out, ‚ÄúStop, STOP, it is not him!
 It is not the Sorcerer Ravenhurr.‚Äù It was a woman‚Äôs voice.
 Then a much deeper voice, one that seemed half growl, responded, ‚ÄúShe is right.
 This is no sorcerer we fight.‚Äù The voice was from his present combatant, the only one who had proven to be dangerous to him.
 ‚ÄúShe is right,‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚ÄúI am not Ravenhurr.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know that,‚Äù challenged another voice from the dark.
 As he stepped forward he recognized the shape of the large aggressive man that Rodregas had first thought was the leader.
 ‚ÄúIf he is not Gerald, then he must be Ravenhurr.‚Äù There was a silent response to that statement, but finally one of the other men lit a torch and held it up.

It was too good to be true.
 I almost looked over at him, but I knew I'd lose myself in a pair of soft, gray eyes.
 Brandon seemed to understand that my silence meant I wasn't convinced.
 "You wouldn't believe how relieved I was when you stepped forward and stopped her before things got out of hand."
 My natural pessimism reasserted itself, undaunted by the fact that I could just see Brandon's exquisitely-muscled arm out of the corner of my eye.
 "If you knew Cassie was in the wrong, why didn't you stop her?
 She's your friend; you should have been able to defuse the situation before it got that far."
 Brandon took a deep breath.
 His voice was quiet now, the perfect example of someone admitting something they weren't proud of.
 "Things are complicated with Cassie.

a secret?
 Something personal?"
 He gazed at her, intrigued.
 "What is it?"
 She dropped her own gaze.
 "The reason I like dancing so much is that I like you to hold me."
 He smiled at the pretty rosiness in her cheeks.
 Taking her hand, he leaned close to whisper, "One day--one day soon--I plan to arrange things so that I can hold you all night long."
 Her blush deepened.
 She understood his allusion, and although she wasn't ignorant of what the marriage bed involved, she had no firsthand experience at all.

It was the late seventies, after all.
 We were also surrounded by some pretty tough guys and nobody really messed with us.
 After years of sparring with a two hundred pound Greek, I was pretty tough myself.
 We would host evening boxing matches in the living room of the house I rented with my friends.
 We had no furniture in that room.
 A boxing match would start with one person calling out another person to fight.
 You could decline but you would endure the collective shaming of the crowd.
 Several sets of boxing gloves were available and once both fighters had their gloves on, the games would begin.
 Cowering in a corner was never a good strategy as the crowd only pushed you back to the center.
 The room erupted when the action was good and the fights were a scrappy version of actual boxing.

Now, once again, there is a manifest tendency to forge a framework based on the supremacy of might, rather than right, and determined by the present balance of powers.
 This framework is likely to be even more tenuous and short-lived than previous compromises, because it ignores revolutionary forces that are reshaping the world for the twenty-first century.
 We now have the opportunity and responsibility to evolve a more flexible and far-sighted framework.
 This requires a fundamental shift in perspective, a new vision of global security.
 Clearly, the competitive security paradigm cannot provide a stable basis for global peace and security.
 A significant reduction in global military expenditure is a welcome development.
 Reducing the quantity and des tructive power of weapons arsenals will certainly reduce the actual and perceived risks of conflict.
 But, at the same time, a tendency is emerging to perpetuate the ‚Äòwe‚Äìthey‚Äô syndrome of competitive security by shifting the axis from East‚ÄìWest to North‚ÄìSouth.
 This has resulted in increasing pressure on developing countries by multilateral and bilateral aid agencies seeking to bring down military expenditure among aid-dependent countries even further.
 In doing so, it ignores the right and responsibility of these nations to provide for their own legitimate security needs at a time when no alternative mechanism exists at the international level to ensure the inviolability of their borders.

On the Road
 Probably all of us high school seniors worried about the reality that soon we would be on our own, sent out to face a rather scary world.
 For a while, that was Eric‚Äôs obsession.
 The atom bomb threat had recently gotten re-stoked when Khrushchev and Kennedy held a stare-down to decide who could launch nuclear missiles from the western hemisphere and who couldn‚Äôt.
 At a coffeehouse near the college I would attend, we overheard people talking about Jack Kerouac and the Beat generation, which Kerouac described as all of us who grew up after Hiroshima and consequently understood just how fragile and tentative life was.
 The end of the world was a recurrent theme of these writers who got called the Beats.
 Any second some madman or tyrant could push the button.
 Kapow, our race is a goner.
 See that coming and, walloped by dread reality, spooked beyond reach of old customs and authority, our nature cries, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs out there somewhere, whatever it is.
 Go find it.‚Äù Eric and I bought Kerouac‚Äôs On the Road, and checked out Dharma Bums and his latest, Big Sur, a memoir in minimal disguise, about a fellow who goes to a cabin in the forest to recover from drunkenness and fame.

‚ÄúI would be happy to help them, but I have to do it as privately as possible,‚Äù said Imeralda.
 The healer did not seem to take the odd request as being unusual and simply stepped away after leading them to two more patients.
 The healer thanked Imeralda for her healing work and the three were heading out the door when a frail voice called out, ‚ÄúRodregas, may I speak to you?‚Äù Rodregas turned around and noticed for the first time the tall shapely form of Karun who had defeated him with sword and shield.
 She had propped herself up now on the bed and waved them over.
 Her arm was clearly broken and her side was bandaged.
 She looked bad, but her complexion looked good and he did not think her seriously hurt.
 His heart froze though at her quiet whisper.
 ‚ÄúYou share a minor sigil very freely for being in the great Cathedral itself,‚Äù her voice was but a whisper, her eyes more curious then challenging.
 ‚ÄúThey would likely die without our aid,‚Äù said Imeralda.
 Doi‚Äôvan nodded next to her.

You could hear music unavailable elsewhere.
 The music of the planets.
 I listened to it alone in my parent‚Äôs living room, hearing sounds that transformed me as surely as did Lorelei, the finding of my own voice.
 ‚ÄúTalkin World War III Blues‚Äù was beyond my ken.
 I thought, perhaps, my head would explode.
 I didn‚Äôt understand.
 In my reptile brain I have also the memory of my friend Ricky Adams‚Äô big brother having ‚Äúfolk‚Äù albums, some by a handsome, young, angular-faced singer named Bob Dylan, whose songs were meant as social anthems, wrong-righters.
 I didn‚Äôt know what to make of these threnodies.
 They were so stark, so naked.
 It was just a man‚Äôs voice, crying in the wilderness.

 "Hey--your hair looks great!

 "It was curled before--that makes it look shorter.

 She thought about the women she'd seen yesterday.
 "Some women have their hair bobbed now."

That pleasure was only one of many that day.
 First she loaded the dishwasher while Rick supervised, and she poured in the soap and started the machine herself.
 After a shower, she had lessons on the use of the food processor, the blender, and--delight of delights--the microwave oven.
 "I can make lunch now," she proclaimed happily.
 "Do you like to cook?"
 "Yes."
 But her face fell.
 "To be honest, I don't know how.
 We have a cook.
 But I'd like to try."

The moment that Ravenhurr crossed into the circle he started to burn.
 His body twisted in pain as he burned the same blue fire of creation that he had called forth to rip apart a man‚Äôs soul and steal the physical essence of a Celestial Lion.
 The flames that he had called forth to steal the AElfin maiden‚Äôs magical abilities now burned him.
 The timing had been near impossible.
 The spell calling forth the flames of creation could only burn one life.
 But the timing was perfect; Ravenhurr called forth the fire, and then he was in it.
 The flames consumed his body in seconds, and flaring from the circle went the multi-colored energy of his magic, the one element that the circle was designed to protect from the flames.
 His magic power shot out of the circle and started orbiting the larger circle.
 He was completely gone.
 Rodregas excitedly thought, ‚ÄúVictory!‚Äù He had done it.

Jason was frozen next to her, eyes darting around at the shadows.
 The dwarf stood perfectly calm in front of us.
 No one spoke because there was nothing to say.
 I heard rustling in the trees and dozens of creatures came thundering out.
 I noticed Thrashers, Frost Beasts, swamp trolls and many others I have never seen.
 They lumbered towards us, teeth flashing in the moon light.
 Seth whirled around on the dwarf.
 ‚ÄúYou set us up!‚Äù he hissed, sword drawn.
 ‚ÄúThis was all a trap!‚Äù The dwarf's eyes widened in alarm, ‚ÄúI swear, sir, that I knew nothing of this!
 I warned you that you must be prepared for anything.‚Äù ‚ÄúSeth,‚Äù I said slowly, placing a hand on his shoulder, ‚ÄúDon't attack him, we need him to help us get through Igneeria.‚Äù I felt his shoulder muscle tense under my fingers but he lowered his blade.

 Even getting home tomorrow wouldn't change what had happened, what she‚Äôd finally realized tonight.

Even as he was talking, Alec was moving towards the door.
 "There's really no need.
 I'm fine.
 I don't need to see the nurse."
 It was obvious he was going to ignore me.
 I tried to thrash around enough for him to put me down, but he restrained my arms with a couple of fingers.
 The motion was so casual I was pretty sure nobody even realized he'd pinned my arms to my stomach with surprising strength.
 I thought about kicking, or even screaming, but that would just leave me feeling like a child and give Alec exactly the kind of attention he was probably hoping for.

 I think my best stuff is ahead of me.
 As far as retiring, I don‚Äôt know what you mean by that.
 I can see me just staying home, writing, being with Lor, house-husband, you know, and just writing, and saying let someone else record the stuff.
 But, I‚Äôll always write.

Jason turned in his sleep, mumbling something unintelligent.
 I needed to talk to someone, but everyone was sleeping.
 I pushed Seth over and his eyes flew open.
 His hand went to his sword but he saw me and he relaxed.
 ‚ÄúWhat was the point of pushing me over, Jazell?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, it seemed better than punching you in the side.
 Were you dreaming?‚Äù I asked.
 He shook his head.
 ‚ÄúJust a bunch of nonsense I don't even remember.
 Why, did you get another vision?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said.
 ‚ÄúIt was with the same voice that was in my last dream.

This principle served to protect the NATO and Warsaw Pact countries in the past, but on an exclusive basis which promoted a polarization of alliances into military blocs and, most importantly, left more than one hundred countries outside the security orbit and vulnerable to proxy wars.
 It should now be restructured on a global basis as a collective security system that offers protection to all nations from external aggression.
 A whole range of new security challenges is rising to confront the global society.
 The increasing number, complexity and unpredictability of security threats cannot be managed effectively and in time without international cooperation based on a fundamental change of attitude.
 We are now at an historic crossroads: one path leads us back to a static, unstable and exclusive competitive security paradigm; the other leads to a far more stable and dynamic cooperative security paradigm inclusive of all nations and responsive to future needs and challenges.
 A global cooperative security system is needed that seeks to strengthen national security without increasing the insecurity of other states.
 It should be based on the fundamental principle that force will no longer be tolerated by the international community as a legitimate instrument of national policy.
 World Army
 The limitations of the competitive security system have given rise to numerous calls for the establishment of various types of standing international military force.
 The role of UN peace-keeping forces has been expanded dramatically in recent years to maintain peace in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia.

The arrow squirmed deeper.
 Qurrah focused every bit of his will upon it, desperately seeking to repulse it.
 His well of energy, which he‚Äôd thought empty, burgeoned and over-flowed.
 The arrow snapped, banishing the necromancer‚Äôs presence, but leaving a solitary impression squatting at the back of Qurrah‚Äôs mind:
 Curiosity.
 Qurrah opened his eyes.
 He lay on his back in his brother‚Äôs arms, yet he didn‚Äôt remember falling.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre alright!‚Äù Harruq hugged him.
 Qurrah laughed.
 ‚ÄúHe lost,‚Äù he said, pointing to the night sky.

He waited though until I finally admitted how tired I was, and then he scooped me up and effortlessly jogged to the top of the peak.
 "Are all of you shape shifters such showoffs?
 At least the change in altitude should bother you a little."
 Alec smiled as he came to a stop at the very top and set me down.
 I waited for a couple of seconds for him to respond and then shrugged and looked out over the arid, Southern Utah landscape.
 The view literally took my breath away.
 I hadn't realized we were quite so close to Zion National Park with all of its incredible greenery.
 The stark contrast between the desert and the lush vegetation was striking.
 "Not a show off, just really eager to get you up here so I could watch your face when you first saw all of this."
 Alec had unzipped his backpack and started emptying it while he spoke.

Get some sleep.‚Äù My mind was still slow, trying to process why he was holding my hand.
 I blinked and nodded.
 ‚ÄúAlright but if it starts getting crazy, wake me up.‚Äù ‚ÄúWake you up?‚Äù he asked and laughed.
 ‚ÄúI'm sleeping too.
 If it gets crazy, they'll wake us up.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said and yawned.
 I leaned my head against the tree and closed my eyes.
 The world seemed to fade around me, along with the bickering and Seth's hand, as I fell asleep.
 I opened my eyes to see that I was in a cave.
 I peered at the entrance of the cave to see that outside it was dark.
 I walked toward the entrance when something stopped me.

I started to stumble, but a strong hand caught my arm.
 ‚ÄúEasy there, honeysuckle.‚Äù Steed‚Äôs voice beside me drew me from the stupor.

 My mouth tingled.
 ‚ÄúA little fairy dust.
 Breath of the siren.‚Äù ‚ÄúWha‚Äô?‚Äù My tongue was thick.
 Steed chuckled.
 ‚ÄúIntoxicating, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù I could hear the smile in his voice.
 My nose tingled and I scrunched it up, giggling at the feeling.
 I shook my head, trying to clear it.

She used the mirror to wipe the tears and kohl smudges from her face.
 Glancing at him, she said, "I don't know your name."
 "Rick.

 "This must be strange for you as well."
 "You can't imagine."
 "I think I can."
 She raised the visor.
 "Can we go to the library now?"
 If this wasn't her home, she was going to find a way to get back.

Ruby took it from my hand.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get you fitted with a sheath.‚Äù I stood there, facing Chevelle, breathless but grinning.
 He was smiling appreciatively.
 I realized we were still being watched and sheepishly turned from him to join the group as they prepared a fire for dinner.
 The evening was filled with stories and laughter.
 Chevelle‚Äôs eyes fell on me often; he seemed in better spirits in general, which made me wonder again about his morning guest.
 Rhys and Rider approached and most of the group went over to meet them.
 Steed moved to sit beside me.
 ‚ÄúVery nice today, Frey,‚Äù he observed.
 I smiled and he added, ‚ÄúYou seem to be a natural.‚Äù I snorted.

It wasn't until we'd been sitting in a secluded corner of the sprawling, green sanctuary for nearly half an hour that Alec finally relaxed.
 There wasn't any visible change to his demeanor, but one second tingles of lightning were dancing along my skin, and in the next heartbeat the unseen world settled into a sleepy calm.
 "Will you do me the honor of allowing me to escort you to the Ashure Day festivities?"
 The question caught me so much by surprise that the tiny ant I'd been watching managed to drag his heavy burden of leaves halfway across the nearest flagstone before I managed a response.
 "Is this because of earlier?
 Because I told you I don't expect you to stay with me?"
 Apparently it was his turn to spend some time pondering his reply.
 My six-legged friend was joined by another of his kind, and they were manfully working their way up the hill towards a tree.
 "I've actually wanted to ask you for quite a while.
 Hearing that Brandon was taking you was harder for me to accept than you might imagine.

After deciding in my favor, he said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a big change coming.
 I don‚Äôt know what it will be.
 It‚Äôs something I feel so deeply, like nothing I ever felt before.
 Maybe it‚Äôll be good.
 Maybe not.

 Her squad danced at basketball games.

 On a Friday evening, Eric, Kenny Neidermeyer, Bill Torrey and I split a magnum of champagne on the pretense of celebrating Kenny‚Äôs parents‚Äô divorce, which had gotten finalized that week.

As the blood poured free, he roared, looked about, and then ran off toward the sound of combat.
 A frail form in rags followed from inside the house, a mirror image in looks but for the paler skin and lack of muscle.
 ‚ÄúYou saw nothing,‚Äù this second half-orc said to him before following the warrior.
 Antonil struggled to his feet, shaking his head all the while.
 ‚ÄúIt keeps getting stranger,‚Äù he muttered.
 He took a step and immediately regretted it.
 As his leg throbbed, he yanked the arrow out.
 His armor had kept it from penetrating too deeply, the barbs unable to latch onto any soft flesh.
 Of course it still hurt like the abyss, but he could deal with that.
 What he could not deal with, however, was how few in number his soldiers had become.

Chevelle tossed out a small flame, giving us enough light to dismount.
 The horses walked to one end of the cavern, their hoofbeats echoing softly, as we remained in the other.
 ‚ÄúFrey.‚Äù Chevelle turned to me as he spoke.
 ‚ÄúYesterday‚Ä¶ the council trackers‚Ä¶‚Äù Trackers?
 I tried to focus on what he was saying and not let my mind run wild with the new information.
 ‚ÄúThey will send someone for what I have done.‚Äù I thought of the councilman‚Äôs face, distorted in pain.
 ‚ÄúWe should continue your training.‚Äù ‚ÄúTraining?‚Äù Even I could hear the dread in my question.
 ‚ÄúPractice.
 You should be able to protect yourself.‚Äù I remembered his words from before the revelation that ended my magic lessons.
 Fighters.

 He caressed her cheek.
 ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs something you should think about.‚Äù  He ran his thumb over her lower lip.
 ‚ÄúYou deserve better, Marie.‚Äù  He tilted her chin up, touching his lips to hers.
 When she didn't pull away, he repeated the feather-light touch.
 He felt her breath, the quivering of her lips.
 He kissed the corner of her mouth and nuzzled her cheek.
 Gathering her closer, he began taking her lips in one soft kiss after another.

Emily, Jason, and Seth ran up behind me and we stared into the cave.
 I took a deep breath and started to enter the cave.
 All of a sudden, a roar made me freeze.
 Two nostrils and eyes popped up from the cave.
 My blood stopped.
 It was a dragon.
 Chapter 8
 I stood, frozen in fear at the sight of the dragon.
 It stalked towards me.
 The piercing green eyes bore into mine and I was more scared than I had ever been in all 15 years of my life.

 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre out later than normal,‚Äù Qurrah said when Harruq returned to their home.
 ‚ÄúI get restless stuck in here,‚Äù he said.
 He dropped his weapons in the corner, shed much of his leather armor, and then released a loud groan as he settled down.

This is tearing me apart.
 I want to spend my life with you.
 But I have to go home."
 "I'll never love another woman the way I love you.
 I can't even imagine how I'm going to deal with the void you're about to create."
 Tears sparkled in her eyes.
 "I'm sorry."
 "I know."
 He kissed her then, slowly, sweetly, longingly, trying to memorize the taste and feel of her mouth.
 He wanted to deepen the kiss, to evoke the passion he knew only too well that she was capable of, but such a kiss would be torture for both of them.

 ‚ÄúHmm.

 Not supposed to leave you.‚Äù I stood, waiting.
 ‚ÄúFood,‚Äù she decided.
 She yanked two cloaks from the corner and tied them on, covering our heads, and led me to the wardrobe by her bed.
 I couldn‚Äôt imagine how we could get any more clothes on as she opened the door and started to throw them onto her bed.
 But she leaned out of the wardrobe door to whisper, ‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù She stepped into the cabinet, dragging me with her.
 We were standing outside the rear of her house.
 She slid the false wall back in place and grabbed my arm again, our heavy cloaks moving like shadows as we ran from the village.

Imeralda saw that Rodregas was also watching Doi‚Äôvan.
 She thought he also recognized the danger of a Hellborn rage.
 Imeralda reached out to Rodregas first to try to get him to calm down and help manage Doi‚Äôvan.
 Imeralda focused on their bond and looked him in the eyes and said, ‚ÄúRodregas getting angry will not change things, let‚Äôs sit down and talk to the village elders.
 They are thankful for what we have done.
 They need payment for their risk, but they understand we have needs.‚Äù Rodregas nodded and seemed to be calming down until Jordaan spoke, ‚ÄúNo, you made your agreement.
 Imeralda you have said that the equipment of the Immortal Guard was ours.
 While our warriors are not as renown as some of the other races, we have several who are worthy of such armor and such gear is critical for our own survival.‚Äù Imeralda could see both men‚Äôs renewed rage at Jordaan‚Äôs words.
 She knew she should calm them down, but her first thought was how stupid men could be, men of all races.
 Sure it would have been great for them to get their better quality armor, but they were only alive because of her.

When they come for you, I will kill them.
 Fighting together we will kill some of their vaulted Immortal Guards.‚Äù As Doi‚Äôvan finished he gave a low growl and shook his horned head, his thick mane of wild jet black hair was almost as distinctive as Imeralda‚Äôs own auburn flowing locks.
 But with Doi‚Äôvan the gesture spoke of defiance and challenge like some great bull lowing his horns and getting ready to charge.
 Until now he had seemed very thoughtful, almost careful in the words he spoke, but when he spoke of killing and shook his head in defiance his mouth widened.
 To say he grinned would not be accurate; he showed his teeth.
 There was something very dangerous about this Hellborn, something that reminded you that this creature was the spawn of Greater Daemons.
 While he might not have chosen the side of the Infernal hells, there was a very dark and dangerous side to him.
 Rodregas could almost smell the fire and brimstone.
 Rodregas met Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs smile with a smile of his own.
 He reached out and grabbed Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs forearm and gripped it in the handshake of warriors and said, ‚ÄúYou have spoken to me honestly.

None of you have argued with Alec about anything since then, but Friday night James, Jasmin and Jessica were all ready to rip my head off over his express orders."
 The nod I received this time was even slower than the first.
 I waited for Isaac to say something, but he seemed unwilling to give away anything I hadn't already figured out for myself.
 "Can he win?
 Alec, I mean.
 Can he ki...beat Brandon?"
 Isaac's sigh was eloquent.
 "I'm forbidden to speak on these things.
 To do so risks no small amount of Alec's displeasure."
 "But you're going to anyways, aren't you?"

And she eventually passed on her addictions to us in one degree or another.
 Let me just say that being an asprin junkie at the age of 6 is a low point in my life, but I‚Äôm extremely proud to have beaten it.
 Well as a kid she used to scare my sister and me with horror stories about the Republican Party and conservatives in general, with the stories about rush Limbaugh being the worst of the lot.
 In fact it wasn‚Äôt until just a couple years ago that I could watch a speech by one of their number without wetting myself and shaking in fear.
 But onto other things well she always was a wonderful cook, with mushrooms and brownies being her specialties, we had those a lot, when there was enough to eat anyways.
 We were poor but happy, often mother would make us clothes out of flowers and stuff, they were colorful and pretty during the summer and they smelled real good.
 But when winter came we would be real cold and sometimes our clothes would fall off, which was real bad when we were away from home trying to make some money to help support us.

But here she was.
 His mind reeled with the implications and unreality of it all.
 And the emotion that permeated his jumbled thoughts was guilt.
 He'd been preoccupied with thoughts of Marie ever since he'd seen her picture.
 Was it possible that his thoughts had somehow brought her here?
 But even if that were true, how could he have known that thinking about someone would cause her to appear?
 He'd loved studying history in school, and Abraham Lincoln had never appeared.
 He scowled at the chicken as he took it from the oven.
 How was he going to help her get back?
 He didn't have much faith-- Marie's scream almost made him drop the chicken.

"Those motorcycles.
 How do they go on the water?"
 "They're jet skis.
 They're made for the water."
 She watched as the actors climbed towers, rode hand trolleys on cables, jumped from shattered platforms into the water.
 And when the heroine shot the villain, causing his jacket to catch on fire, Marie screamed.
 It was so real, and she gripped the edge of her seat as she waited to see what would happen after he fell into the water.
 The villain jumped up on the platform to make his bows with the rest of the cast.
 Marie raised wide eyes to Rick's face as they stood to leave.
 "Was that man who was on fire hurt?"

He had often looked into the darkness.
 For the first time, the darkness had looked back, and it was amused.
 Whoever this necromancer was, Qurrah knew he had been an idiot to challenge him.
 ‚ÄúLead the way,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúAnd forgive my outburst.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI understand,‚Äù Harruq said, ignoring the pain in his knees and the bit of blood running from his elbow to his wrist.
 ‚ÄúWe need to hurry, though.‚Äù
 He looped his arm through Qurrah‚Äôs and then hurried down the alley.
 As a soldier‚Äôs body collapsed at the end, the two stopped, and Harruq swore.
 ‚ÄúThe orcs made it through,‚Äù he said, to which Qurrah nodded.

When I reached the edge of the onetime garden, I stopped to kneel, digging my fingers deep into the soil to form a trench.
 When I saw the bared roots, black and rotted, I was suddenly exhausted.
 It was too much.
 It took me to that familiar, mindless place, and I turned to walk toward home, void of any sensation save the slow rain on my skin.
 When I entered the house, Fannie was there, but I only trudged past her on the way to my room.
 I barely took notice of her expression, her tight grin and suspicious eyes as she took in my mud-streaked clothes, dripping hair.
 I didn‚Äôt speak; I was spent and I just couldn‚Äôt make myself care.
 In the dark of my room, I collapsed onto the bed, dropping asleep to the thrum of falling rain.
 I woke gasping from another dream of my mother and destruction.
 The rain had stopped, and the sun was rising, so I wiped the sweat from my brow and went to the hall pitcher to splash my face.

 Then there are a few odd minutes where I squeeze in some reading, or a bit of painting."
 "They're beautiful.

 I imagined I could hear him smile.
 "Thank you.

In the Netherlands, voluntary part-timism has been identified as the biggest single potential for creating new jobs, capable of reducing the country's unemployment by up to 50 per cent.
 Proportionately reducing working hours and salaries can spread the existing work more evenly over more people.
 Evidence suggests that reduced working time can raise productivity significantly.
 Extending vacation time and medical leave in the United States nearer to levels which the Europeans enjoy would create many more job openings.
 Work or job sharing is not an ultimate answer in itself, but it can have a beneficial short-term impact, allowing time for longer-term measures to take effect.
 As a minimum, governments should remove the artificial barriers to job-sharing created by employment laws, administrative procedures and trade unions.
 Social security tax systems should also be modified to remove the in-built bias that increases the taxes of those who hold multiple, part-time jobs, rather than one full-time job.
 Such constraints limited part-time jobs to around 10 per cent of the total in Belgium, France, Italy and Spain compared to around 25 per cent in Britain and Denmark.
 4.Modify tax policies:The present income and payroll tax system raises the real cost of labour relative to other resources, such as capital and energy, and thereby discourages job creation.
 It heavily taxes people for working, which indirectly raises the cost of labour and reduces the number of jobs.

I started to pull away from the guard but he didn‚Äôt release me.
 I realized then I hadn‚Äôt been dismissed.
 It had been a direction for the guard.
 He wrenched me beside him, jerking unnecessarily, and then shoved me through the door to my room.
 I listened, but his steps did not recede.
 I tried the door; it was already bound.
 I threw myself onto the bed.
 I felt absolutely wretched.
 Actually, I felt worse than that.
 I felt as if I‚Äôd been poisoned.

After educating the public about the need for choice and the necessary costs involved, the final selection of the most accept able package should be made by the people themselves through a national referendum.
 2.Establish macro-economic stability: The errors in earlier efforts at adjustment and stabilization have led some to argue for a series of compromise programmes that do not seriously ad dress the imminent dangers of hyperinflation and economic collapse.
 No transition strategy can be successful without first creating stable conditions for economic growth.
 No effort to improve agricultural production or the availability of food will be successful so long as the currency is not accepted as a stable means of exchange.
 This is the ultimate justification for the insistence of the international lending community on harsh measures to stabilize the economy.
 If the previous stabilization programmes have not proved politically viable, socially acceptable or economically effective, alternative programmes similar to the Yugoslav strategy must be attempted without further delay, backed by the full commitment of government.
 In some cases, it may be necessary to temporarily reintroduce controls on wages and prices as an interim measure to stop the free fall of the currency.
 But whatever the method, it is essential that this effort be combined with simultaneous implementation of other essential policies.
 3.Eliminate crop losses: In Russia and the other republics of the former USSR, highest priority in agriculture must be given to efforts that will increase the availability of food and reduce the huge crop losses and massive food imports.
 These losses vary by crop and region but average between 25 and 50 per cent of total field production for major crops.

Our handshake had ended, but my hand was tingling slightly.
 It was a pleasant, if illusionary, reminder of the contact, one I was hoping would last for about the next three days.
 "You must be the poor soul who's got everyone buzzing with curiosity."
 Brandon reached into the tall, glass-fronted fridge next to the cashier while he was talking, and pulled out a bottle of water and one of those aggressively-colored energy drinks.
 He slipped some money to the cashier while I was still trying to come up with a response that didn't sound stupid.
 "Um, yeah.
 We just got into town last night."
 He handed me the bottle of water.
 "Well I hope you'll like it here."
 "Wait, what's this for?"

It's like, oh, I don't know, I think maybe learning about the past will help me understand what's going on right now."
 Mallory's sigh seemed to allude to every one of her presumably substantial years.
 "How very perceptive.
 The past is very much driving what's happening right now, but so much of the past is tied up with the very things from which Alec's trying to protect you."
 I was bubbling with questions, but sensing that now wasn't the time to push, I sat back and waited in silence while she decided exactly how much to tell me.
 "Alec's father was killed nearly two decades ago.
 I don't remember everything about that night, I wasn't even conscious for a large part of the happenings, but the pieces I do remember are sharper than they should be.
 Sharper in my mind now maybe than even when they happened."
 Her hand gripped mine with a fragile strength that hinted at the vibrant, powerful woman she'd been back then.
 Back before the years had worn at her.

At the very least, you should have started screaming.
 Instead you wander around, take in some rather feeble attempts at art, and then sneak out without saying a word."
 Secure in the knowledge he could see me, I stuck my tongue out at him.
 "Hey, my survival instincts, or lack thereof aren't the point.
 Stop trying to distract me."
 "I suppose I deserved that.
 It's just more than a little unsettling how quickly you're putting pieces together.
 There really are things that aren't safe for you to know.
 Among them, the reason why it isn't safe for you to know them."
 I waited expectantly, and he finally resumed.

The lifeless body of a small gray bird.
 A garden of weeds with roots as black as soot.
 The faces of council as their speaker struggled to breathe.
 A thistle growing in Evelyn‚Äôs throat, slowly choking off her airway.
 Chevelle‚Äôs face when he had asked who had showed me to fuse the crystal with blood.
 His expression as he‚Äôd looked down at me the night before.
 How could you not know?
 That image haunted me the most.
 It seemed familiar somehow.
 He‚Äôd let his guard down, and though strained with worry and fear, there was something else there, sadness or maybe just plain sympathy.

‚ÄúGoes down easy, I say,‚Äù the guard said to the bowman.
 ‚ÄúHow much you want to bet this guy is the sick bastard killing the kids?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúHow much you wanna bet we can hang him even if he isn‚Äôt?‚Äù the other asked.
 Both guards laughed, and the sickness in Harruq‚Äôs gut grew.
 A boot kicked his stomach, and he knew his patience was near its end.
 Visions of ripping out entrails filled his mind, and all his willpower kept him crouched there.
 A kick to the face forced him over, and he reached for the impact point along his cheek.
 A sword hilt quickly found his exposed chest.
 Rolling over only shifted the next few blows to his back.
 When the heel of a boot crushed down on his kidney, Harruq felt ready to slaughter, no longer caring if he was caught or killed.

They make this a rare moment in history for a quantum leap forward, which many have dreamed about but few believed achievable.
 Seizing this opportunity requires, most importantly of all, a change in awareness, attitude and perspective.
 Several ideas will be of abiding value in our endeavour to make the most of this rare moment.
 Our present problems and future potentials can only be understood when viewed from a wider historical perspective that avoids getting lost in the media-driven drama and intensity of momentary crisis and short-term trends.
 As recent global action to protect the environment amply demonstrates, public awareness and understanding are growing too rapidly and becoming too important in global affairs for us to rely on the present positions of governments or current public sentiment as gauges of what may be achieved in the near future.
 More reliable indices of what is possible are the underlying currents that are rapidly raising the value of the human being, bringing nations together in ever-closer co-operation and mutual interdependence, and pressing the international community to raise its goals.
 The world is blind to the measure of its own accomplishments.
 We need fully to recognize the astonishing magnitude of the achievements of the present century and fully to understand the process that made them possible.
 This process expresses itself as scientific, technological, commercial, political, economic, social and cultural development.
 But its driving force is social and psychological.

Globally, production rose from less than 250,000 vehicles in 1910 to 42 million in 1980.
 Nine decades later, the automotive industry is still the largest manufacturing industry in the world and the single largest source of jobs in the American economy.
 Every job created in automotive manufacturing has spawned roughly ten more in related occupations.
 Thus, about 9 per cent of the USA‚Äôs entire workforce is employed in occupations directly related to automotive manufacture, sales and services, road construction and maintenance, and transport of freight and passengers.
 Globally, 7 to 9 million workers were employed in automotive manufacturing in 1980 and perhaps as many as 50 to 80 million in related occupations.
 In addition, the spread of automotive technology has had tremendous impact on the growth of other industries stimulated by the greater mobility of the public ‚Äì retail trade, hotels, restaurants, tourism, recreation ‚Äì and indirectly on agriculture, as well as every other service and manufacturing industry that benefits from lower cost and greater speed of passenger and freight transport.
 Advances in technology provide society with greater conveniences and in the process endow the society with greater creative and productive abilities.
 Over time, these new abilities spur the creation of new activities in many different fields distantly related to the original point of innovation.
 The process results in improvements in health, which raise the level of physical energy; higher standards of education, which raise the level of mental energy and culture; and higher levels of social skills and organization, which raise the energy level of the entire society, making it ever more creative and productive.
 A comprehensive study of this wider process of job creation and destruction arising from technological innovation is needed to develop specific coefficients for measuring the impact of technological advances in different fields on total employment.

Every woman he knew loved chocolate, and it was rather comforting to think that there were some things that transcended time.
 After they'd finished their ice cream, Rick rose and began to clear the table.
 Marie stood as well, saying, "I'll wash the dishes."
 "No thanks--I have a dishwasher."
 "A maid?"
 "No."
 He chuckled.
 "Watch."
 He quickly loaded the dishwasher, poured in the soap, and turned it on.
 "The door is locked, and hot water will blast the dishes."

‚ÄúAurry?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúYou said most elves remember when men were created‚Ä¶‚Äådo you know how orcs were made?‚Äù
 The elf looked at him.
 She was trying to read him, Harruq could tell, but he endured it without protest.
 ‚ÄúWhen Ashhur and Karak warred, there were elves that sought to end it,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúAgainst Celestia‚Äôs orders, they joined Karak, hoping their aid would finally end the conflict.
 When our goddess imprisoned the two gods, she cursed those elves.
 She stripped them of their beauty, their intelligence, and their long life.
 They weren‚Äôt evil, Harruq, but Karak offered them strength and they accepted it.
 The dark god drove them to war against elves and men.

Cars
 I have always loved cars.
 Though I can‚Äôt draw any better than either of my daughters could at three years old, I spent thousands of bored minutes in grade school sketching sleek, rocket-like cars.
 From my first memories until I was ten, my dad was a route salesman for a wholesale meat company.
 He drove a Chevy bobtail.
 The box was insulated and chilled by blocks of dry ice.
 Whenever school was out, I used to ride with him on overnight runs to El Centro, in the desert, which in the summer turned so hot, I imagined all the inhabitants were escaped criminals who figured the police wouldn‚Äôt chase them into that hellish air.
 Going over the mountains in the truck cab with my dad sitting tall behind the wheel and jamming the mysterious floor shift back and forth, I gazed down at the other drivers and passengers and felt safe and full of everything that mattered.
 Many dozens of times, I rode with my dad on the narrow and winding two-lane highway past the very boulder that crushed Eric‚Äôs head.
 My first successful story was called ‚ÄúCars‚Äù.

Worse because I was fuzzy again, bound.
 He nodded.
 He was closer now, sitting opposite me, and I had the disconcerting feeling that I‚Äôd lost the bit of time when he‚Äôd moved there.
 He reached out and took my hand in his, his fingers gentle as he turned it palm up to place a pebble there.
 ‚ÄúCan you do anything with this?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Frustration was clear in my voice.
 I had already tried.
 ‚ÄúAnd no fire?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo nothing works?‚Äù The implication was there, but I didn‚Äôt know what it meant right away.
 And then it occurred to me.
 The horse.
 I had thought he had shown up because I‚Äôd impressed upon him to follow before I blacked out, but I had already been bound again at that point.

In many countries, a large proportion of small enterprises are established by women and employ predominately women.
 An appropriate mix of policies focusing on access to technology, training, credit, marketing and distribution channels can substantially accelerate self-employment, particularly in the informal sector and rural areas, and among women.
 Expand services
 The service sector represents only 25 per cent of the labour force in developing countries compared with more than 67 per cent in the industrial nations.
 Contrary to common conception, services can be a major contributor to job growth even in countries at earlier stages of development.
 This sector is as amenable to stimulation by government policies as agriculture or manufacturing, and it also provides impetus for the growth of other sectors.
 Supportive policies have enabled trade, transport and other services to generate more than 50 per cent of all jobs in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.
 Services have produced more than half of all job growth in many other Asian nations, including private day-care centres, nursery schools and computer training institutes, which are multiplying rapidly in many countries, but can be expanded much further.
 India has adopted an innovative, low-cost, self-employment strategy to expand availability of long-distance telecommunications services by setting up small private telephone and fax centres throughout the country.
 Informal private service enterprises in construction, commerce, food catering, repair and transport have vast growth potential.

I like learning magic, though I am just beginning.
 I would think that I would take on a minor sigil or two.
 I am a great warrior, but I like to learn new things and I would like to have sufficient magic to be able to learn spells.‚Äù Rodregas nodded.
 Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs response would have surprised him before, but he had learned much of the thoughtful Hellborn in their time together.
 When one looked at him and how powerfully built he was, it was incredible to imagine what he could do on the battlefield with a greater sigil added to his power.
 He would be a true daemon on the battlefield.
 But while Doi‚Äôvan loved his strength, he also loved his intelligence.
 In comparison, Rodregas was less interested in exploring learning as he was about what he could do as a warrior and carrying out his duty.
 ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we are going to have any options for sigils for now.
 Let us continue to learn what we can of battle and of magic.

During the first three decades of post-colonial independence, almost all of the continent‚Äôs 54 states had come under either single-party or military rule.
 The preference for authoritarian rule was often justified by the need for rapid economic development, which could be impeded by opposition to government policies and by the need to contain regional and tribal conflicts.
 Neither of these claims has proven true.
 Living standards have actually declined in most African countries during the last two decades.
 Regional and tribal politics have flourished.
 Dozens of civil and inter-state wars have been fought, accounting for millions of lost lives.
 Food production and employment have lagged far behind population growth.
 In the absence of legal channels of protest, opposition parties have frequently resorted to violence.
 By the end of the 1980s the lack of material progress and the emergence of young educated professionals in leadership positions had fostered, on the one hand, a revolt against single-party rule and, on the other, popular pressure for multi-party democracy that have together resulted in a democratic domino effect, similar to the spread of communist rule which Western democracies had feared would overwhelm South Asia twenty years ago.
 As recently as 1989, only four African countries could be considered stable democracies and three more were moving in that direction.

The pouch I had rescued from the vault fell to the bed.
 How had I forgotten?
 I kicked off my shoes and pulled my top and pants off before sliding the gown over my head, straightening the length with my hands.
 The corset laced tight at my waist, the plunging neckline lower than anything I would ever wear.
 I retrieved the leather pouch from the bed to examine the contents, but before I loosened the binding I heard a crash behind me; three council guards had busted open my door.
 I tucked the pouch under the long bell sleeve of the dress as they crossed the room to seize me by the arms.
 Chapter Five Trials
 I stood in the center of a council chamber I had never before seen.
 Vast libraries lined the walls, interspersed with decorated frames and ornate mirrors.
 A great vaulted ceiling rose overhead, embellished with intricate carvings, painted in every detail.

Unemployment is highest among the least educated, least skilled categories, such as machine operators, fabricators and labourers.
 The poor are poor both because they have no assets and because their time and labour have low or no economic value.
 Poverty persists wherever the human resource is under-valued.
 To eradicate it, there is need for a paradigm shift from unskilled to skilled work.
 While educated unemployment is high in many developing countries, in most cases the quality and relevance of the education to employment opportunities is far from adequate.
 Here too, fully qualified technical and professional workers are in short supply.
 There is even a shortage for educated workers with a high level of general language and communication skills to fill the job opportunities being created for business process outsourcing.
 On an average, 50 per cent of firms surveyed in a cross-section of developing countries report that skill shortages are a serious constraint on their growth.
 Firms that adopt new technologies report even more serious problems.
 In addition, the work force in many developing countries also lacks advanced productive skills for agriculture and a broad range of other basic vocations.

The necromancer stepped outside his home, walked to the side, and stared at the flickering lights in the distance.
 Campfires and torches.
 An army, the same that had removed him and his brother from their home, slept so close.
 Every one of them contemplated their death.
 Qurrah closed his eyes and inhaled the cold night air.
 Yes, the tension was delectable.
 The quiet moments before battle were a rare thing that so very few were lucky enough to experience.
 Fear, worry, hope, prayer, regret, and sorrow all floated to the stars.
 The half-orc let his attuned mind drink it all in.
 Beautiful, he thought.

‚ÄúWhat is it you wish to say to me?‚Äù the elf asked, ignoring the flailing hands that pawed at his face.
 ‚Äú _Hemorrhage,_ ‚Äù the half-orc hissed.
 The elf‚Äôs face exploded.
 Qurrah fell over onto his side, breathing as slowly as he could through the blood that filled his throat.
 The dead body of the elf crumpled in front of him, all of his hate-filled features gone from his face except for a single eye.
 The half-orc stared, wondering if his brother was truly dead.
 Darkness crept at the corner of his sight.
 His strength was fading fast, and he had little doubt that if he passed out he would never wake.
 He struggled to lift a single numb hand, then flopped it down on top of the dead elf‚Äôs leg.
 Qurrah took as deep a breath as he dared and then spoke the words of a spell.

Cut off their head or puncture the lung and heart.
 Never mess around.‚Äù I imagined myself decapitating someone.
 I laughed as I realized my mind placed Fannie there.
 Ruby didn‚Äôt look like she could think of anything funny about what she‚Äôd said, but she continued.
 ‚ÄúSecondly, don‚Äôt cut yourself.
 These things are sharp.‚Äù She moved to toss the sword to me but reconsidered and handed it over, making sure I had a good grip.
 There were intricate designs carved on the handle and runes etched in the blade.
 It wasn‚Äôt as heavy as it appeared.
 I moved it around a bit, slashing wide arcs though the chill air.
 It was pleasant, nicely balanced in my hand.

Trying to be as casual as possible, I looked into the art room as I hobbled by, but they'd rearranged their stations, and someone's easel was in the way now.
 The sprained ankle had slowed me down enough that there was no way I was going to make it back to my locker before the bell rang.
 Still, I tried to be gracious when it went off just as I handed Mrs. North the papers.
 Based on the number of classrooms on the second floor, and the narrowness of the stairs, there was no point in trying to wait the crowd out.
 I gritted my teeth and limped out into the surge of bodies.
 Surprisingly enough, there were more familiar faces than expected.
 As I grabbed the handrail on the right, I noticed Isaac several feet ahead of me.
 Of course, it's hard to miss someone nearly six feet tall and almost as well-muscled as Alec.
 Even if he was partially hidden by Vincent, who was strutting along a little higher up the stairs with all of his usual arrogance.
 If Isaac had been the one close enough to reach out and touch, I probably would've tried to get his attention and said hi.

It was if they went from being made of steel to air.
 He tossed them aside.
 Velixar pulled from within his cloak a chest the size of a small stone.
 He placed it on the grass where it shone gold in the light of the stars.
 As the two brothers watched, he whispered a few words of magic, enlarging the chest to normal size.
 ‚ÄúOver the centuries, I have gathered many items to aid those who would swear their lives to me,‚Äù Velixar said.
 The locks clicked open, the lid raised, and then he reached inside and pulled out two swords sheathed in gleaming obsidian.
 ‚ÄúThese swords were once wielded by Aerland Shen.
 He led the elves that aided Karak in the great war against Ashhur.
 When Celestia cursed his kind, they shared his curse.‚Äù Velixar smiled at Harruq, his eyes gleaming.

You seem not to like people prying about your attacks, and you were less happy than usual today.
 I thought you could use the break."
 Apparently he'd decided against the truth option.
 "I¬†looked unhappy today?
 You, who never crack a smile unless you're going to get something out of it, were concerned about the fact I wasn't all smiles and giggles?
 Maybe you should flunk a test or two.
 Only it doesn't really count unless your dad, you know, the one who used to make your birthdays really special, is gone."
 Alec's mouth opened, closed, and then assumed its normal place in his unreadable mask.
 He reached out, almost consolingly, but I stepped away before he could make contact.
 I knew I should shut up before I said something really unreasonable, but my anger was in the driver's seat now.

BG: 	Ok, so we got a local reputation, a sort of groundswell, that started small and then ran along the faultline that runs under the Bluff City.
 We were what they call an underground success, what Memphis specializes in.
 We were talked about but you had to be part of the cognoscenti, the insiders.
 I hated this, if I was aware of it‚ÄîI really don‚Äôt remember.
 Keep in mind, all I wanted to do was play my guitar and write songs.
 And I was writing at an astonishing clip and artists were picking up on it, and, well, the money started coming in.
 See, in a way, I was fortunate.
 I never had to sack groceries at Piggly Wiggly or teach school, or cut lawns.
 Writing songs, I learned early, brought in the bucks.
 And a lot of the talent coming out of Nashville, well, a lot of those guys were singing my stuff.

Got us some studio time.
 He‚Äôd been to numerous practices, knew our stuff.
 And he agreed to produce, under the name Euphonious Moniker.
 Of course, now, everyone knows he did it, but back then, I don‚Äôt know, there were legal complications or something.
 Anyway, with Jim there, well, he gave us the confidence to do it.
 So we started laying down tracks.
 Now, the story that‚Äôs told is that I hated recording, that I was, I don‚Äôt know, juvenile, about doing numerous takes.
 I probably did say, ‚ÄúThat was good enough,‚Äù a couple times.
 But, man, Jim is such a gentle man, he just took it all in stride.
 He knew when it was done, man, when it was complete.

She wasn't properly his.
 There was no bond of Ja'tell, and consequently we have no obligation to return her to him."
 Jasmin opened her mouth to say something else, but a tiny brunette, probably Jessica, interrupted her.
 "Alec, we have to do this.
 None of us are stupid; we know what's going to happen.
 You killed two members of his pack."
 There was steel in Alec's voice that I'd never heard before.
 "Still unacceptable.
 You've all aired your opinions; you can retire to your beds now."
 James looked up from where he'd been slouching against the wall, and I suddenly realized that he wasn't shaking from cold.

She could tell he was angry.
 "What's wrong?"
 "Nothing."
 He dropped onto the blanket.
 "Yes, there is."
 She knelt beside him.
 "What is it?"
 After a few moments he turned to face her.
 "Do you know why those guys kept throwing the frisbee to you?"
 "To watch me jump and bend."

Nobody really seems to know, at least nobody who's talking, but they're almost always together.
 You really shouldn't go there; he's brutal when it comes to breaking girls' hearts."
 There was a story there, but I wasn't about to ask now and expose myself to further ridicule.
 Britney was oddly quiet as we entered the lunch room.
 I was a little hungry, but the pangs were a distant kind of discomfort.
 The real suffering for not eating wouldn't come into play until we hit the tutoring lab.
 Oh well, when I got home ravenous and ate a decent-sized meal Mom would probably be ecstatic.
 Or too wrapped up in some project to even notice.
 It was hard enough anticipating what I was going to do from day to day.
 Trying to figure Mom out was truly futile.

He let out a screech and vaulted off her, running as fast as his legs could take him.
 I held an arrow out and Emily set it ablaze.
 I drew back, launching the arrow, and watching it as it hit the dwarf in the back.
 The fire charred its dying body and I looked away to face my new attacker.
 One jumped on my head and I swung with my knife.
 It yelled into my ear, ‚ÄúThe one will rise, the one will rise!
 He will destroy you!‚Äù I stabbed at him again, ‚ÄúWho?
 You‚Äôre being too vague!‚Äù He jumped off me and ran into the woods.
 He disappeared before I could notch an arrow and shoot him.
 Soon we were alone again.

They don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôll make it.‚Äù My brain catapulted through space, into a black hole.
 There I remembered the night my mom checked into the hospital and the doctor said she was probably a goner.
 ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll make it,‚Äù I said with defiance.
 ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs Superman.‚Äù She nodded.
 ‚ÄúLet's keep hoping.
 Billy and Cliff should be on their way here, I sent a pass for them."
 The others in the car hadn‚Äôt gotten scratched, she said, and waited for an assurance that I wouldn't collapse or fly into a rage.
 I asked her if I could go meet Billy and Cliff.
 Knowing which way they would walk to the office from their auto shop class, around behind the football field, I took that route.
 The teacher was engaged with a carburetor and didn‚Äôt notice me trespassing in his class.

 Mother‚Äôs room remains sealed, but I was able to obtain some of her things from Father‚Äôs study.
 I am only to use them under Rune‚Äôs supervision, so I took the books out and returned to my room with them in secret last night.

 I‚Äôll have to practice on a servant first.

Paper and cardboard blackened the windows.
 When we removed these window covers, we found broken panes behind them.
 The bedroom doors had been kicked in, and broken bongs and stem pipes, empty cigarette packs, matchbooks, just trash littered every surface.
 I don‚Äôt know what the hell these people (my son!)
 did in here, but the carpet could not have been dirtier if they raised farm animals indoors.
 Pictures of Brandon and his friends holding automatic weapons were nearly the only things upright.
 Sex toys filled the drawers and around his bed.
 Apparently, it had been a real bohemian festival at some point, at least to the people who hung here.
 Everything was broken or ajar, apparently ransacked while Brandon was in jail.
 Nearly all of his belongings that were worth anything were stolen by the scumbags who had been his peers.

The sophomore she was helping looked like he wanted to be anywhere other than trying to figure out how long it would take Sally to mow the lawn given a certain width of lawn mower moving at a given rate of speed.
 "Oh, Adriana.
 Go ahead and walk around looking for students who need help.
 Most everyone will leave in the next ten minutes or so, but we're actually open for another hour."
 She was right.
 Nearly everyone left over the next little while as they either finished up their assignments, gave up, or finally filled whatever quota of study time they'd been given by their parents.
 I did get to answer a couple of questions, which was surprisingly fun.
 When there was only half an hour left Mrs. Campbell walked over.
 "Good job so far.
 Albert, the other tutors, and I are all going to head out.

The End of the World
 During summer before our senior year, Eric worked as lifeguard at Carmen Ranch Club.
 The first few weeks, on his days off, we hung out at La Jolla Shores.
 While Eric worked, I often helped Cliff and Bill Torrey and their dad rebuild a ‚Äô56 Thunderbird.
 Sometimes I visited my cousin Jill at her Pacific Beach apartment.
 Jill was nineteen.
 One Friday evening, she hosted a party.
 I drank several beers, then invited somebody who reminded me of Karen Flagstad to join me for a cruise up the coast road to La Jolla.
 Her name was Kris.
 She would go with me, she said, if not for a babysitting job she had that night.

(laughs) It was my mother‚Äôs kitchen radio‚Äîit‚Äôs still around here somewhere.
 And, on this particular morning of oatmeal and familial familiarities, a song emanated from that plastic box, bellowing something about a ‚Äúblack branch with blood that kept dripping.‚Äù You know?
 And, ‚Äúa white ladder all covered with water.‚Äù  I thought, holy hell.
 Of course, by this time, I was making my own music, fixing to go out on my own, and, in a way, I saw Dylan as a map, as a way out into the world.
 What more can we ask of art, right?
 Later, when I met him, I talked to him about this and he was, well, flattered, I guess, and he talked about how Guthrie and Leadbelly were like that for him.
 All these memories collide in my head to form a capharnaum around what I want to know more concretely: how did Bob Dylan become important to me?
 And the process must have been gradual, an accretion, Bob Dylan never became, for me, what James Joyce was for Richard Ellmann, or to use a less pretentious comparison, what hamburgers were for Wimpy.
 A centering object, a holy thing.
 But he became a dream-figure, a part of my unconscious, as I understand the term.

You didn‚Äôt think about lifting your leg to get on the horse, you just knew you wanted to climb on and your leg lifted.‚Äù Chevelle caught us then, riding up and cutting off Steed‚Äôs explanation with a clipped, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt the time for a magic lesson.‚Äù All three horses slowed to a walk as Chevelle shot Steed a glance.
 I could only think of our lessons, of the fire in the clearing.
 It had been so obvious once Chevelle had urged me to control a stronger flame, I guessed because I had been using the power in small doses for so long.
 ‚ÄúWhat about your hands?‚Äù I asked.
 ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù Steed said, ignoring Chevelle‚Äôs warning glance.
 ‚ÄúWhy do you use your hands, if you just think it, I mean?‚Äù He laughed.
 ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs simply a quirk, I guess.
 Habit.
 Like when you‚Äôre playing flip ball and you want your piece to go in so bad you lean hard to ‚Äòhelp‚Äô it.‚Äù I remembered the game from when I‚Äôd first come to the village.
 The children would be bound from magic and have to throw an odd-shaped piece into the corresponding hole on a game board across from them.

I bowed out of our little competition even earlier than usual.
 I probably should have stayed in the game longer, should have kept answering questions until she came up with a real stumper, but I wasn't in the mood.
 Once I was safely free to let my mind wander, I couldn't think of anything other than the look on Jasmin's face.
 Even the steadily rising temperatures achieved by packing more than thirty bodies into a tiny classroom with only one door wasn't sufficient to really distract me.
 I was going to suffer once again for having stumbled into somewhere I didn't want to be.
 By the time I made it into English and sat down next to Britney, my heart felt like it was going to seize up.
 Mr. Whethers walked into class a few seconds after the bell rang, took one look at his already perspiring students, and told us all to go ahead and spend the time reading rather than worrying about trying to focus on a lecture.
 It was a nice gesture, and normally I would have appreciated it, but I'd just finished Wuthering Heights, and knew that flipping the book back open wasn't going to help distract me.
 Unwilling to spend another hour in worry, I let my thoughts drift over to another, dangerous area.
 Thinking about Brandon wasn't safe anymore.

The game had held no interest for me.
 I didn‚Äôt have to be bound to not have magic.
 It wasn‚Äôt a novelty, it was everyday life.
 ‚ÄúWe should stop for breakfast,‚Äù Chevelle said.
 We hadn‚Äôt been riding long, but it wasn‚Äôt a suggestion.
 I didn‚Äôt mind; I‚Äôd eaten mostly berries for days and I wasn‚Äôt quite sure about riding yet.
 ‚ÄúI suppose you‚Äôre right.
 Might as well enjoy the journey,‚Äù Steed said, throwing me a private grin.
 We stopped under the canopy of a red oak and Steed grabbed me as I slid awkwardly from the horse.
 ‚ÄúYou may ask him to kneel, Elfreda.‚Äù Not that he appeared to mind handling me about the waist to help me down.

‚ÄúPlease, brother,‚Äù Qurrah said.

 Harruq stared at the dirt, each breath making his shoulders heave.
 His mind reeled, and for reasons he did not understand, he opened his mouth and said, ‚ÄúThat which I fear and desire.
 I have had no questions answered, but I do know this: the time for questions has long ended.‚Äù
 Velixar nodded.
 ‚ÄúIndeed, Harruq.
 It is time for action.
 I am done with both of you.
 Go home and rest.

The whip struck at my head, forcing me back down.
 She circled me, cracking the whip every time I attempted to right myself.
 I couldn‚Äôt get a foothold.
 ‚ÄúCome now, Freya, you must defend yourself.
 Fight me.
 Stop me.‚Äù Snap!
 Snap!
 Snap!
 She was faster now, cracking the whip above me and at each side, moving again and again, closer and closer.
 I had to think of something but my mind could only concentrate on the snap of her whip.

When Dieredon had first come to her, she had expected little difficulty in the task.
 ‚ÄúThey are new to the town, and when they came so did the murders,‚Äù he had said.
 ‚ÄúMeet with one of them, discover who they are.
 If they are the vagrant scum they appear to be, it will be easy enough to catch them in their crime.
 The humans can then deal their judgment with a rope.‚Äù
 It seemed perverse that she had met Harruq by saving him from the fate she was supposed to doom him to.
 Still, Aurelia was not one to judge by appearances, and what she had seen that night had seared her heart.
 Two soldiers beating Harruq bloody without cause or reason, Harruq who was so kind to her when they sparred, who brought her flowers and told her stories, who looked upon her like she was a goddess of light in his dreary world‚Ä¶
 Harruq drew his sword.
 It shook in his hand.

It was just too painful.
 I was confused, drained to the point of exhaustion.
 I had no way out.
 When they found me, I would have to surrender.
 I could see no other option.
 No one came.
 I wasn‚Äôt fool enough to go back voluntarily, but for some reason, they hadn‚Äôt followed.
 I didn‚Äôt know what to do with myself.
 I had nothing outside of home, outside of the village.
 I didn‚Äôt even know where to go, didn‚Äôt know where I was.

‚ÄúAre you trying to kill me?‚Äù she asked, ‚Äúand are you really trying to rescue a Forest Nymph from a tree?‚Äù The laughter that followed was pure and open and even he had to laugh with it.
 ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù he asked, ‚Äúwhat are you doing?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, I decided that if this was a greater sigil I should touch it.
 Even though I do not want a greater sigil to consume my magic, this is the One Tree.
 And well, I am a Nymph.
 So I reached out and touched the tree and nothing happened.
 But trees speak to me.
 Speaking to the One Tree was wonderful; the One Tree is here and not here.
 Somehow it can be reached from here I think is the best way to describe it.
 But there is no sigil to be had.
 The tree ‚Äòspoke‚Äô to me as trees do, and it explained about the ‚ÄòBlessing of the One Tree,‚Äô that is probably why it was here like the greater sigils.‚Äù Imeralda spoke in a conversational tone but also like she was amazed by her own story.

"Young Mr. Graves instructed that you were to have every convenience.
 I'm sure that included access to what we all jokingly call the second library.
 Besides, this is where you'll find the copies of all your textbooks."
 It must have been obvious I wasn't convinced, but Donovan wasn't dissuaded.
 He pointed to the cell phone, still grasped uncomfortably in my hand.
 "In the event that you need something, it is likely you can just say my name and I'll hear you.
 If not, that wonderfully infernal device is, I believe, programmed to call me if you hold down the number nine.
 I am of course completely at your service."
 I opened my mouth to protest, but moving much too quickly, even with his painful-looking limp, to be a normal human, he'd already vanished around the corner.
 I stood awkwardly in the doorway for several minutes, but I couldn't resist the draw of all those books forever.

I rolled it up, tucking it under my arm as I approached the castle.
 My prison.
 Prison.
 I pushed the book into my pack and finally slept.
 When I woke, I felt better.
 Stronger.
 I was hopeful this applied to my magic as well.
 Chevelle sat against the dark stone wall, watching me.
 He seemed to recognize the change in my mood.
 ‚ÄúFeeling well?‚Äù I nodded.

He walked over to it.
 It looked like it could have been the twin for the beast that had been devoured by the blue flame on top of Raven Keep.
 He stepped up close looking up at the beast; he was massive!
 The beast‚Äôs mouth was open, not as if he was going to roar, but simply in relaxed pose.
 He looked like he had been caught stalking forward on the hunt.
 Rodregas stepped up and just stared at him.
 He was beautiful.
 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch,‚Äù barked Doi‚Äôvan.
 Rodregas nodded, he knew not to touch, but then realized that his hand was raised and had been reaching out to stroke the lion‚Äôs mane.
 He knew that this was the greater sigil that he wanted to gain.

Alec's pause was long enough that I think I nodded off, but the sound of his voice once he resumed talking pulled me back awake.
 "Originally there were just two of the moonborn, a pair of brothers called Adjam and Inock.
 Unbeknown to the Moon, the Earth had anticipated his great gesture of love, and sent forth a plague upon the land.
 As Adjam, the elder of the brothers, descended from the heavens and touched down upon the Earth, he collapsed to the ground in pain.
 Despite his agony as the very bones of his body rearranged themselves, he managed to call out a warning to Inock, to flee back to the Moon.
 The love of Inock for Adjam was so great that he rushed to his brother's side, where he too fell victim to the Earth's plague."
 I wanted so very badly to remain awake, but wrapped comfortably in the warmth of Alec's arms, I couldn't fight off exhaustion any longer, and I felt myself drift off into dreams of two brothers who survived the plague, rising from the ground after seven days, one a wolf, the other a jaguar.
 Chapter 24 I'd been awake for several minutes before I finally remembered where I was.
 I rolled over, opened my eyes, groaning when I saw that the other side of the bed was empty.
 Who knew what Alec thought.

Apparently I was hurrying just a little too fast.
 I tripped just before I hit the first step, and almost went crashing down the flight that led to the basement.
 Luckily I was just quick enough to grab the banister and save myself from a broken neck.
 I didn't quite manage to avoid twisting my ankle though, so I limped all the way up to the second floor.
 Trying to be as casual as possible, I looked into the art room as I hobbled by, but they'd rearranged their stations, and someone's easel was in the way now.
 The sprained ankle had slowed me down enough that there was no way I was going to make it back to my locker before the bell rang.
 Still, I tried to be gracious when it went off just as I handed Mrs. North the papers.
 Based on the number of classrooms on the second floor, and the narrowness of the stairs, there was no point in trying to wait the crowd out.
 I gritted my teeth and limped out into the surge of bodies.
 Surprisingly enough, there were more familiar faces than expected.

I wanted to ask if this was where he was from, but was afraid to set off any conversation that might end with me being hauled back to council that much quicker.
 I looked again out over the lake to the mountains.
 If I was incarcerated for a thousand years in the village, I would want this memory.
 I breathed deep; the air was cool, moist, and smelled so unlike the harsh floral scents that saturated every part of the village.
 I could sense the deep green moss covering the rocks at my feet, the fir trees that edged the east bank.
 Even the soil smelled richer.
 My eyes were closed as I took it in, and a soft touch brushed my cheek.
 Chevelle.
 I opened my eyes and realized he had swept debris from my face.
 I wiped a hand across my forehead and dried mud crumbled away.

are you still a virgin?"
 "Yes.
 But Mother--"  She stopped, biting her lip.
 Her mother had enough to think about now.
 She'd better wait a few days before telling her about how Rick's kisses had made her feel.
 "I'm a virgin, Mother.
 But I love Rick with all my heart."
 Mrs. Tranton swallowed, twisting her hands.
 "Will you be going back to him?"
 Marie's eyes filled with tears.

In a few months, Cliff would get drafted.
 Neither of us were anxious to shoot anybody or die as heroes.
 But Cliff‚Äôs dad fought in Korea and wasted no respect on anybody who let other boys go to war while he attended college.
 Even before our tequila arrived, the Marines were telling us about a training film.
 It showed photos of camouflaged pits where guys fell onto sharpened and poisoned poles, and tunnels through which soldiers had to crawl chasing invisible warriors.
 Maybe the thoughts of death by poison or stabs in the dark made my stomach roil.
 Or maybe the cause was the sight of a dancer on the stage beside the bar.
 She was naked except panties sagged around her knees.
 I thought, the babe with auburn hair could be here in her place, if instead of having folks who were churchgoing gringos she had gotten born where I imagined this stoned, lost and weepy dancer had, as the fifteenth child of someone who lived in a hut beside a brown river.
 When a fellow vacated his bar stool, I excused myself from the table and moved there.

"Did I say something wrong?"
 Alec's voice was surprisingly gentle.
 "No, you've nothing to feel sorry about.
 I should tell you though that calling a shape shifter a werewolf is the kind of insult that nearly always results in a fight, and often even a death."
 I felt momentarily like I'd been hit.
 Alec was waiting for me to respond, but I couldn't bring myself to say anything.
 "I'm sorry; I didn't mean to scare you.
 I forget sometimes how much more violent my world is."
 I wasn't any less shocked, but his tone was so apologetic I couldn't help but smile.
 "That's better; I much prefer the happy Adri face to the scared Adri."

 Qurrah left his brother to rest.

 ‚ÄúGrab my wrist,‚Äù Qurrah said as the dark cloud arrived that night.
 Harruq did so, and together they stepped inside.
 He felt an unseen hand grab his chest, and then they were running blind.
 The minutes crawled, their frantic breathing the only audible sound.
 Qurrah lagged further and further behind, unable to keep the pace.
 Harruq tightened his grip on his wrist and pulled him along.

He took her hand, pressing his lips into her palm.
 "If you belonged in 2011, things would be different."
 He stroked her fingers thoughtfully.
 If she belonged here, he would be pursuing her relentlessly.
 But she wanted to go back to 1927.
 So there was absolutely no point in falling in love with her.
 Marie found herself thinking about Rick all the time that week.
 He was always smiling, always kind and gentle.
 He showed her new things he thought she'd like and took her places and bought her gifts.
 But what she enjoyed most was just being with him.

Their problems are further aggravated by environmental degradation due to soil erosion, deforestation and depletion of water resources.
 Lack of effective organization and management is a common denominator linking all these deficiencies.
 More effective forms of organizations can eliminate or compensate for these deficiencies to a large extent.
 For example, in India more than 10 million farmers are successfully engaged in sugarcane cultivation, precisely because an established system of contract farming provides them with access to technology, quality inputs, credit and an assured market for their produce.
 India became the world leader in milk production only because of the power of scale conferred on small producers through the dairy cooperative movement.
 A similar organization is presently lacking for most other crops.
 The successful establishment of more than one million Self-Help Groups (SHGs) in India over the past three years providing access to credit for 15 million small farmers illustrates the power of organization.
 It is an indication that the phase of society‚Äôs predominant dependence on government initiatives for development is coming to a close.
 An organization combining the advantages of SHGs and contract farming through the agency of an NGO or an agri-business centre operated by farm and home science graduates or entrepreneurs can be successfully extended to other crops, providing the technical knowledge and essential inputs that small farmers need to raise productivity and farm incomes.
 Crop Diversification: Eradicating hunger necessitates shifting production from traditional crops to higher value added crops that can improve nutrition, while generating higher on-farm incomes and greater off-farm employment.

Since a food shortage in the urban areas was the most pressing problem and greatest source of anxiety for the population, the government took steps to distribute more than 16 million small private plots to urban and rural families, so that highly vulnerable households could produce at least a portion of their own food requirements.
 These plots now account for more than 50 per cent of vegetable production and 80 per cent of potato and fruit production in Russia.
 Transitions require changes in behaviour and the private plots became an activity in which millions of people could participate in order to augment their own living standards and alleviate national food shortages.
 Similar catalytic efforts are needed in other fields to engage the population actively in new and improved activities.
 11.Reduce reliance on foreign aid: The prospect or lure of foreign aid has itself become an impediment to successful transition.
 In order to qualify for foreign assistance, these countries have overlooked the vast under-utilized resources available domestically, rejected the knowledge and advice of their own most experienced people in favour of foreign advice, sacrificed their most cherished social values, discarded even successful institutions and systems, and taken steps which, it was painfully obvious to many within these countries, could not possibly lead to the intended results under the prevalent conditions.
 In the 1950s, the Soviet Union managed to recover from the horrendous destruction it suffered during the Second World War and to embark on a period of rapid industrial growth without any external assistance.
 But today, without having passed through the ravages of war, the republics desperately seek foreign support and feel helpless without it.
 It is right that the world community should generously support the successful completion of the reform process in this region that is so vital for world peace.
 But it is also right that these countries should recognize the enormous untapped potentials which they possess ‚Äì human, natural and productive ‚Äì rather than be distracted by the prospect of a large influx of foreign capital.

He grabbed Qurrah‚Äôs arm and hooked his elbow around it.
 Qurrah was too weak to complain, so together they ran down the streets.
 They passed closed homes containing people praying for safety and victory.
 Looming ahead of them was the southern gate.
 Hundreds of soldiers stacked against it, their shields braced and ready.
 All along the walls, archers released arrow after arrow into the darkness.
 ‚ÄúHow are we to get closer?‚Äù Qurrah asked.
 ‚ÄúIgnore them,‚Äù Harruq said.
 ‚ÄúI know what I‚Äôm doing.‚Äù
 He led them into an alley in between several worn buildings made of stone.

--@ Chapter 15 My alarm pulled me out of the strangest night of sleep I'd ever experienced.
 Maybe I'd just been overtired, or possibly the strange, symbol on the note, inked into the place where a signature normally would've been, had reminded me of the other truly alien experience so far in my life.
 Whatever the reason, it felt like I'd spent all night on the edge of one of the incredible, vivid dreams.
 I kept catching glimpses of the characteristic soft glow out of the corner of my eye, but hadn't ever actually slipped into a full-blown dream.
 It'd left me feeling very unsatisfied.
 I rolled over and pulled the note out from its hiding place in my dresser.
 I had the words memorized already; the symbol was what I wanted now.
 The note was proof of the existence of our benefactor, but the sigil on the bottom of the page was a clue to his identity.
 It was incredibly intricate and completely different than anything I'd ever seen.
 Once again I traced the sharp edges and smooth swirls with my eyes, marveling at the way it hinted at further complexity lurking just out of sight.

"Oh, that's perfect.
 I don't understand any of this junk, so you can explain it to me now and then we won't have to spend as much time in that stupid tutoring lab."
 The old me would have told Britney she was a self-centered wench, but the new me, the one that was all too aware of how much it would suck to go through the next two years of school without a single friend, just forced my face into something approximating a smile and tried to explain why drawing something at random from a bag with replacement was different than drawing something from a bag without replacement.
 It was a fairly straightforward concept that we'd seen twice now.
 I was pretty sure Britney was capable of understanding, she just didn't care, which was the one thing virtually guaranteed to make me mad.
 Stupidity was bad enough; laziness would be a hundred times worse.
 Still, by the second time through I'd clarified a couple of points I'd been a little fuzzy on, and was almost ready to believe Britney might actually apply herself to listening.
 I was so caught up in what I was doing, and the ever-so-slowly growing light of interest in Britney's eyes, that the rest of the class had fallen silent for a full twenty seconds before the drop in noise registered for me.
 "I want everyone back to their regular desks and hard at work on their assignments."
 Mrs. Campbell wasn't as pale as she'd been when she'd left, but she still looked unsettled and more than a little unhappy, presumably with both whatever had caused her to leave so quickly, and the fact that she'd come back to a class where almost nobody had been doing anything productive.

Then Jasmin manifested her royal wolf form and things settled down a little."
 We were venturing into unknown territory for me.
 Alec was usually so careful to keep me sheltered from his world.
 "Was Jasmin dominant then?
 I mean if she was a royal wolf and you hadn't manifested your hybrid form yet did she win all of the fights?"
 Alec rested his cheek on the top of my head.
 "Not exactly.
 If she'd been a little more heartless she probably could have killed me and cowed the rest of the pack.
 Even then though, it was becoming pretty clear that we couldn't have two separate packs in such close proximity.
 The need to keep the pack strong meant that even though she pretty much ran the show most of the time there was the occasional thing that I'd just refuse to back down on."

‚ÄúYes, I know of few other cases like this.
 She will always know where you are.
 And my guess is if you are open to the bond, you will be able to know where she is.
 But, there are also deeper implications.
 The mating bond is one of the great sources of power for the AElf peoples,‚Äù he said.
 Rodregas did not understand fully what Jordaan meant but he suddenly added, ‚ÄúThen, if Imeralda is bonded to me, she will always try to keep her connection with me?‚Äù He asked a question, but he thought he already knew the answer.
 Jordaan nodded.
 ‚ÄúShe will love others, but she is bonded to you for all time, until one of you dies.‚Äù Rodregas sat quietly, stunned by the news.
 No more words passed between the two until Jordaan was about to leave.

I need a car, so I buy a Toyota.
 If I needed a car that would break down, I could buy a Jaguar.
 ‚ÄúAnd it isn‚Äôt only the desire for stuff that devours our time.
 It‚Äôs also that we try to buy security.
 People think they need to not only have lots of stuff, but to save or invest or buy some insurance so they‚Äôll be sure they‚Äôll always have lots of stuff.
 We need a bit more faith.
 I mean, I don‚Äôt have AAA or any kind of roadside service insurance because every time a car of mine has broken down, it‚Äôs been a block or so from my mechanic‚Äôs house.
 Except one time.
 ‚ÄúThe one time my car broke down in an inconvenient place, a guy stopped to help me, and he happened to be the handsomest man I ever saw.
 Maybe he was an angel.

"You're going to be an extra.
 You won't say anything, and it'll only be a couple of minutes.
 It's really not much, but it's hard to--" "I'm going to be in a movie!"
 She turned and threw her arms around him.
 She was in a party scene, one of six people that formed a group with the star.
 She wasn't supposed to do anything but smile and sip her drink, but when the star gave her a smoldering glance during rehearsal, the director decided he wanted to film it.
 The result was a split-second close-up of her face, and the star kissed her hand.
 Marie felt as if she were going to burst from excitement.
 They were allowed to watch filming until lunch, and then they were given a tour of the rest of the studio.
 Marie heard obscenities and shouting, and she saw two different actors storm off two different sets in the middle of their scenes.

I almost choked when warm wine hit my throat.
 He leaned forward to get a better look at me as I lowered the container.
 He looked as if he thought I might spook, otherwise I guessed he had plenty to say hidden beneath that smirk.
 It didn‚Äôt stop him from moving uncomfortably close, though, or eyeing me with what I was certain was the same look I‚Äôd just given my meal.
 I cleared my throat, thinking I‚Äôd made my sense of discomfort clear when he started to move, but he only stood, which brought him even closer.
 Well, parts of him.
 I turned toward the fire, tugging the pack tight against my shoulder as I prepared for a graceful exit.
 For departure from food and warmth.
 I jumped a little when the first tree uprooted across the clearing.
 It was only a sapling, but the second and third tree followed.

She missed her mother and father and friends, and she didn't think she could bear it if she thought she'd never get back.
 What if she skipped her walk in the garden today and today turned out to be her chance to get back?
 But she knew that no one in 1927 was going to take her to Hollywood.
 She smiled, remembering with pleasure the moment when Rick had said he was taking her to Hollywood.
 Her heart sped up again at just the memory.
 Hollywood!
 Rick was giving her her dream.
 He'd known her only three weeks and was taking time off from his job to take her where she wanted to go.
 No one had ever been as sweet to her or as thoughtful as Rick.

A second son, Bryce, was added to our family two years later.
 I have tried to explain to my friends with no children yet that having children changes everything suddenly.
 Every day, sometimes every second, delivers a new challenge.
 As much as they want me to tell them what to expect, I cannot prepare them, as no one could have ever prepared me.
 I have told my friends to imagine driving down a beautiful highway on the way to a vacation spot in the mountains, with all of your plans for the trip clearly in your mind.
 Now imagine that your car‚Äôs emergency brake is unexpectedly pulled‚Äî hard‚Äî your calm drive is suddenly spinning out of control.
 You don‚Äôt know which way to turn the wheel or what pedal to push.
 You just act and react and pray for the best all within a moment.
 And the car never regains control.
 That‚Äôs parenting.

And I didn‚Äôt know how I knew, but I was certain I didn‚Äôt want my memories back.
 What I had was already too much.
 I couldn‚Äôt fathom the pain Chevelle had suffered, surely a hundred times mine at the loss of my mother.
 His mother‚Ä¶ his father‚Ä¶ each member of his family?
 How much loss had he endured?
 Tears streamed down my face.
 Chevelle took a step toward me and I was struck by fear.
 He must despise me.
 That was why he‚Äôd become my watcher.
 He gave a curt nod at my reaction, his head still dipped as he walked away.

It was a crude thing but of the proper size to qualify for the tournament.
 He dressed and ate quickly, and walked out to the sands of the arena.
 The arena smelled fresh.
 Sometime during the night it must have rained and young squires had raked the sands.
 The final competition of the tournament was a true melee.
 Only the top ten finishers qualified.
 There was no taking turns.
 The ten were spread out in a circle.
 In the center of the arena was a shield painted with the seal of the knighthood, a winged sword in the clouds.
 The squire who claimed that shield and made it to the Cathedral‚Äôs main hall with it would be knighted on the spot by the Knight Commander of the Order.

After they'd finished their ice cream, Rick rose and began to clear the table.
 Marie stood as well, saying, "I'll wash the dishes."
 "No thanks--I have a dishwasher."
 "A maid?"
 "No."
 He chuckled.
 "Watch."
 He quickly loaded the dishwasher, poured in the soap, and turned it on.
 "The door is locked, and hot water will blast the dishes."
 She blinked.

Lor and I rented a cabin up on the White River and we just hid away.
 I didn‚Äôt write a fucking thing, didn‚Äôt even read the newspapers.
 I don‚Äôt mean to imply that I could have done something, that I had any more power than the Pope or The Beatles or, you know, fucking McNamara.
 I mean, though, that I wanted to know, I wanted to understand.
 I wanted the information that Walter Cronkite or Eric Sevareid had, the insider stuff, so that I wasn‚Äôt just up there entertaining the fuel for the fire, you know, like the orchestras that played as the Jews were led into the ovens.
 I started to feel like that, that I was a chimp, a dancing fool.
 This was like before The Moratorium, right?
 Before we really all felt the power.
 The War was just this endless one-note playing over and over and driving us insane‚Äîme insane, sorry, driving me insane.
 And, like, I know that a song is just a song‚Äîyet, I have to believe there is something there, an element, a catalytically charged element.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll both go,‚Äù she pushed, forcing a polite tone.
 The rest of the group was quiet, watching us, and Ruby eyed Steed as we turned and headed toward the house.
 As soon as we were out of earshot, though I was still being dragged by the arm, I asked Chevelle, ‚ÄúDid something happen with the twins?‚Äù Ruby laughed.
 We both stared at her.
 ‚ÄúTwins,‚Äù she scoffed.
 ‚ÄúRight, well, you know what I mean,‚Äù I said, embarrassed.
 Chevelle‚Äôs tone softened.
 ‚ÄúNo.
 Everything is fine.‚Äù Ruby chimed in, ‚ÄúIt is fine,‚Äù and I was knew it was intended for him.
 He relaxed his grip on my arm and slowed our pace as he directed an almost imperceptible nod at Ruby.

Qurrah waited.
 The Neldaren warriors charged, hoping to overwhelm their opponents before arrows took them all.
 The elf in the window leaned out to unleash a killing strike, but it was Qurrah who did the killing.
 Four pieces of bone leapt from his hand.
 They hit the elf‚Äôs neck and temple, making a satisfying crack.
 The archer spilled through the window and landed with a clattering thud.
 ‚ÄúThe rest are yours, brother,‚Äù he whispered.

‚ÄúThere could be more,‚Äù Grey insisted.
 That brought me back, no matter how disturbing my realization was.
 ‚ÄúMore?‚Äù Chevelle gave the bickering group an admonishing glare as he approached me.
 I could hear the alarm in my own voice when I repeated, ‚ÄúThere are more council members coming for me?‚Äù He tried to calm me.
 ‚ÄúFrey‚Äî‚Äù I cut him off.
 ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt let you all pay for my crimes.‚Äù Confusion passed over their faces, everyone except for Chevelle.

 ‚ÄúBesides, they are pursuing me.
 For choking the tracker.‚Äù Grey shook his head.

If I was wrong, Mom was not only home, judging by the noises filtering down the stairs, she was awake and only a few minutes away from coming downstairs.
 Even filled with the near certainty that Brandon's parents, and by extension him, were our secret benefactors, the next fifteen minutes were some of the longest in my life.
 When Brandon's Mustang finally appeared around the bend in the lane, I found myself smiling so hard my face was starting to hurt.
 Breathing silent but heartfelt thanks that Mom was in the shower and therefore couldn't hear the low rumble of the Mustang's engine, I slipped out the front door and skipped down the concrete steps.
 "I figured you were either too sick to get out of bed, or you finally decided to trust me."
 Brandon's gray eyes twinkled as he made a show of checking me over.
 "Looks like you're not sick."
 I didn't know it was possible to blush and smile at the same time.
 "Nope, not sick."
 After such a beginning, my day could hardly be anything but great.

Brandon was still smiling, but I got the feeling that it was a little more forced.
 "Perfect.
 I'm going to go take care of some stuff then, but I'll see you both tomorrow."
 Mrs. Campbell looked up from the plant she was watering as we walked into the tutoring room.
 "Ah, there you two are.
 Britney, you'll be sitting over there from now on.
 Adriana, go ahead and get started on your homework.
 When you finish come find me and we'll get you situated."
 As always, Rachel was sitting at her table in the middle of no-man's-land.
 She looked up at me and smiled as I took my usual spot and started on my homework.

Those clear, deep eyes met mine for a second, seeming to look past the surface and all the way down to the bleeding mental gash that'd just triggered my most recent collapse.
 I was trying to marshal my arguments, but his eyes wiped my mind clean.
 I couldn't form another coherent thought until he shook his head and looked away.
 "You need to see the nurse."
 My mind hiccupped for a second.
 There should be some kind of law requiring him to hide those things.
 Sunglasses, or maybe a blindfold.
 "I'm fine.
 That wasn't anything; it didn't mean anything.
 Please put me down."

‚ÄúCanadian Sunset,‚Äù ‚ÄúOld Brown Jug,‚Äù ‚ÄúSt.
 Louis Blues,‚Äù ‚ÄúBlues for Allen Felix.‚Äù  It was a revelation.
 But, never to be repeated.
 I think I was about 6 at the time, but that hour in front of Dick Delisi and the Syncopators is as fresh in my mind as if it happened yesterday.
 Man, my dad.
 What could he have been?
 Given different times, a different circumstance.
 He said something odd to me one time, he said: ‚ÄúBud, music is a bad demon to have.
 Like hooch.
 If I could have done anything else I would have.‚Äù  And, of course, he did, I mean playing at the Vapors wasn‚Äôt bringing in enough money to support his small family, so he did books for a paint store.

The tension suddenly flickered like a dying light bulb.
 "Vincent!"
 I was disoriented for a second.
 The yell had come from behind me, and had torn the two apart faster than I'd believed possible.
 The crowd, packed so tightly that I'd been worried someone was going to get pushed over the railing, separated as Alec flowed down the stairs.
 I'd only thought Isaac and Vincent were graceful.
 Alec made them look like drunken frat boys.
 Vincent spun around so fast it almost looked like he was going to fall down and then backed away from both of them like a cornered animal.
 It was hard to decide whether my excitement at seeing the biggest jerk I'd ever met humbled outweighed my dislike for Alec, who'd pretty much locked up the honor of being the second biggest jerk.
 A surge of dread washed through me as Vincent backed closer to the wall in an effort to maintain his distance from Alec.

It was enough to know that Vincent's was the lesser evil.
 "Adri is here solely as a witness."
 Alec's voice was huskier than normal, but still carried most of its velvety perfection.
 As I looked at him, I realized I wasn't feeling any power arcing from him.
 Everything centered on him now, but he wasn't adding to the storm.
 The wolves behind Brandon growled as Alec stepped forward.
 "Ah, and here I'd thought you'd once again settled on a course of appeasement."
 Brandon's features were hollow, almost skeletal in the harsh chemical light.
 "No.
 We've come for one purpose and one only.

That of course made me feel heartless and guilty in turn, but I was still too fragile to deal with her issues.
 When it's all you can do to get through the day yourself, it's impossible to be a pillar of strength for someone else.
 History was a complete waste of time.
 I hadn't even made it through the reading assignment, and I still got a perfect score on the pop quiz.
 Physics was surprisingly full.
 Apparently Alec was the only hard-core party animal in the class.
 I was still feeling weird from Britney's story, so unlike the rest of my classmates, who seemed genuinely intrigued by the assignment, I just pretended to leaf through a reference book all hour.
 Spanish was as bad as history.
 Mrs. Tiggs turned on one of the Spanish TV channels within thirty seconds of class starting.
 Towards the end of the hour I finally started to come back out of my funk, so I put the last few minutes to good use reviewing vocabulary for the quiz on Tuesday.

That was a highly improper action, of course, but then, this was a situation for which no etiquette had ever been designed.
 And besides, it had felt so good.
 The water was cooling, so she rapidly bathed, washed her clothes, and stepped out of the tub.
 The bath towel was big and fluffy and felt wonderful against her skin.
 She looked askance at the night shirt, however.
 She'd never worn such a thing.
 When she put it on, she found that it fit her like a tent.
 But oddly enough, she liked it.
 The big bathrobe almost reached her ankles, and she felt quite comfortable as she picked up her dress and wet clothing and went across the hall to the bedroom.
 She found hangers in the closet and hung her clothes there.

In the long term greater international trade, like technology, expands overall employment opportunities substantially.
 Trade also counters the tendency of prices to increase along with incomes in more developed countries.
 Living standards rise as consumers benefit from the availability of lower-priced imported consumer goods.
 One of the greatest barriers to solving the world‚Äôs employment problem is the perception that trade destroys jobs.
 As in the case of technology, the interactions are complex and must be viewed in their entirety, rather than in isolated industries.
 The global economy is not a zero sum game in which increased production by one country must necessarily result in reduced production by another.
 Trade opens up new opportunities.
 It permits each country to specialize in industries where it possesses a ‚Äòcomparative advantage‚Äô.
 This specialization enables it to evolve improved processes to achieve higher levels of quality and productivity, larger production volumes and lower costs.
 This results in higher incomes for its workers and makes their products more affordable in other countries, which in turn raises standards of living abroad.

He decided to take advantage of it.
 He spoke very slowly and carefully, letting her know that he knew what he was saying.
 ‚ÄúActually, I was looking at you, you are amazingly beautiful.
 Your incredible eyes and hair, you are breathtaking.‚Äù Rodregas looked at her, his eyes going slowly over her entire body as he spoke.
 Then he shifted his gaze toward Imeralda‚Äôs large green eyes.
 As their eyes held he slid over to her, running the back of his hand across her cheek.
 ‚ÄúYou are so beautiful, your skin so soft,‚Äù Rodregas said.
 ‚ÄúYou are the complete woman; beautiful, intelligent, brave.‚Äù He reached down and placed his finger below her chin and raised it up to be equal in height to his.
 ‚ÄúI have wanted you since I first saw you,‚Äù and with that straight forward statement, he reached down, and holding her face steady with his single finger, he slowly, softly kissed her.
 For a moment she tried to pull away, but he kept the pressure of his finger steady and firm so she could feel his desire.

Many centuries have passed, Qurrah.
 I am the hilt of Karak‚Äôs sword, the greatest priest in the war against Ashhur, and I have not relinquished my position.‚Äù
 The man‚Äôs eyes grew so bright that the half-orc felt the urge to grovel.
 ‚ÄúAshhur himself killed me.
 Karak brought me back.
 He cursed those who had failed him, changing his realm into the abyss.
 I was the only one he spared, and he gave me life with all of his dwindling power.‚Äù
 The two sat in silence as the fire crackled between them.
 Qurrah dwelt on all he had heard, trying to decide what he believed.
 Strange as it seemed to him, he accepted every word.

I can't ask them to run that gauntlet carrying you the whole way."
 I ran my finger along his cheek, mirroring the motion he'd done to me so many times.
 "Then don't ask them.
 You'll either win, in which case it doesn't matter whether I'm there or not, or else I don't care what happens."
 Both fists were knotted now, and unless I was very much mistaken, there was just the barest hint of a shake there as well.
 "Don't be ridiculous, Adri.
 You should know at least a little by now what they're capable of.
 I can't let you expose yourself to the kinds of things Vincent or Brandon would...it's out of the question."
 Mom had always gone on and on about how nurturing I was.
 When she was less happy with me, she tended to focus more on just how stubborn I could be.

Comprehensive Strategies
 While most of the prescriptions listed above are known to all, very few are systematically and efficiently applied.
 Africa can benefit enormously by applying strategies that have worked in Asia.
 The ‚ÄòProsperity 2000‚Äô programme evolved by ICPF for India and presented in the next chapter seeks to utilize a combination of these strategies to generate 100 million new jobs within a decade or less, which will be sufficient to raise 25 per cent of the world‚Äôs poorest billion people above the poverty line.
 Given a comprehensive approach, the right mix of policies, good government and a conducive international environment for trade, technology transfer and investment, every nation has the capacity to develop and meet the employment needs of its people within the next one or two decades.
 The Right to Employment
 The transformation of social life in this century has drawn hundreds of millions of people away from a subsistence level existence in agriculture to urban areas and industrial employment.
 In the process it has brought about an unprecedented advancement in living standards around the world.
 But it has also engendered a way of life in which the livelihood of individuals is far more dependent than in the past on external conditions ‚Äì the state of the national and global economy, trade policies, interest and exchange rates, levels of military spending and overall consumer demand.
 Modern society, even in the most liberal democracies, has become so structured that it leaves less and less freedom for truly independent individual initiative.

During the twentieth century, humankind has achieved an unprecedented mastery of its physical and social environment ‚Äì soaring into space and landing on the moon, exploring the ocean floors, harnessing the power of the atom, delving into the secrets of the human brain and creating machines that imitate many of its functions, unravelling our own genetic code, generating unimagined wealth for many, proliferating national and global institutions, evolving the rudimentary foundations of world governance.
 Yet the very magnitude of these accomplishments has generated a sense of dependence and even helplessness.
 Our own creations have cast a spell over us.
 Impressed by the power of our works, we feel obliged to submit to our own incomplete and sometimes faulty constructions, rather than to complete or modify them to better meet our needs.
 Instead of marvelling at the wondrous achievements of the modern era, we should marvel at the unlimited human capacity for invention and progress.
 The beginning of the third millennium is an opportunity for us to rediscover the ancient truth that human beings, individually and collectively ‚Äì not material resources, nor the technology we invent, nor the institutions we fashion ‚Äì are the primary resource, driving force, centre-piece and ultimate determinant of our development.
 The key lies within us.
 Some Common Challenges
 Listing future achievements does not mitigate the very real and pressing problems that confront us now.
 A brief catalogue suffices to indicate the magnitude of these challenges.

My eyes squinted open as I resisted the urge to stop the birds.
 It was the first time I‚Äôd slept away from my bed; disoriented, I glanced around.
 It didn‚Äôt help.
 I‚Äôd never been far from home and the new landscape was unsettling.
 But when I looked away, I noticed the neatly stacked pile of fabric and loaf of bread that had been positioned beside me.
 I silently cursed the watchers who had apparently found me during the night.
 I didn‚Äôt see them anywhere, so I assumed they‚Äôd left me out here as punishment.
 Some part of me wanted to burn the pile for spite, but my stomach overruled the thought.
 Reaching out to grab the bread, and then, since I had already defied my belligerence, the stack of clothes, I stood to find a creek to clean up and finally get out of this ridiculous dress.
 It took a moment to locate the trickle of water, but the creek was only a short distance away.

I expected them to turn around swinging, or at least swear at him.
 I didn't expect them to remain in their seats stunned and shaking like trauma victims.
 An usher finally arrived to see what all of the commotion was about.
 The older boys shook themselves and then looked for a second like they were going to try and get Alec kicked out of the theater.
 The sense of being caught in some kind of electric sandstorm momentarily intensified, and then faded away as they got up and left.
 I felt my mouth drop open again as they scurried out of the theater without once looking back.
 Alec, who I'd always figured had the depth of an old-style Mickey Mouse cartoon, had just faced down two older boys, and singlehandedly saved my Les Mis√©rables experience.
 Valjean launched into 'Who am I?
 ', and almost against my will I was pulled back around to where I could see the stage.
 Even as enthralled as I was by the music, I made a mental note to thank Alec after the performance.

You do have to admit, it would help explain why you're still here."
 "Right, gorgeous, rich boy who also happens to be the next best thing to a super hero.
 I must be out of my mind not to run for the hills."
 "You don't like it when I spend money on you and the more involved you get with me the less likely it is I'll be able to protect you."
 "If I let you buy me something will you quit trying to scare me off?"
 "No, but it would make me feel better."
 He said that last with his heart stopping blue eyes gazing directly into mine and I nearly stopped breathing.
 Somehow he hadn't realized yet that when he looked at me like that there wasn't anything I could deny him.
 "Ok, you can get me a present, something small and relatively inexpensive."
 Alec smiled and reached over to the backpack as he sat up.

Her body shook with sobs.
 Rick scooped her up and sat down with her on his lap.
 "Please don't cry, sweetheart," he pleaded, kissing her hair.
 He opened his mouth to tell her that she might not even be able to get back, since she'd been unsuccessful so far.
 But that would just hurt her more.
 Still, the thought calmed his own turbulent feelings.
 When her tears were exhausted, Marie rested quietly in Rick's arms.
 If they had been in 1927, everything would be different.
 Rick was so much warmer, so much more thoughtful and loving and fun than Davis.
 She would never have given Davis a second glance if she'd known Rick in 1927.

Jim ‚Äì You‚Äôre questioning my love life?
 Johnny, you‚Äôve never had a date in your life, and some times I doubt that you ever will.
 And Gene, well I don‚Äôt know where to start with you, the last time you went out with someone was during that week that you thought you might be gay.
 Now I‚Äôm not an experienced judge of what makes another guy attractive, but I would have to say that your date was the single ugliest man I‚Äôve ever seen in my life.
 Eugene - Frank was not ugly, well he was ugly, but he was a nice guy and a good friend.
 Jim ‚Äì And let me guess, a good kisser.
 Eugene ‚Äì We never actually got to the kissing point of the relationship.
 Johnny ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt want to know that!
 Jim ‚Äì And that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so damned funny.
 Besides, you‚Äôll need some knowledge about such things if you ever manage to talk some girl into spending time with you.

Johnny ‚Äì Clich√©?
 I‚Äôm not the one who just used a movie quote in a inspirational speech.
 And I have the right to be pissed off.
 Jim ‚Äì Johnny, do you still have mom‚Äôs note?
 Johnny ‚Äì What do you mean?
 Jim ‚Äì I mean the letter she wrote us before she left.
 The one that we were all the spawn of Satan and that she felt corrupted by being related to us.
 The one that she said‚Ä¶
 Johnny ‚Äì To my family.
 I despise the day that Arthur asked me to marry him.

"I'd...we'd...spare you it if we could."
 It was my turn to shake my head.
 "No, this is my fault.
 I belong here, not cowering in a corner somewhere."
 Rachel hugged me from one side while Dominic placed a gentle, dark hand on my other shoulder, and then we were off.
 Brandon, and what must have amounted to his entire pack, were waiting for us just off school property.
 The two leaders faced off as everyone else fanned out around them.
 Jasmin, Isaac, and the others all maintained calm exteriors that were markedly different than the eager, often sadistic expressions of Brandon's people.
 "I demand satisfaction on behalf of my pack for the two of our number that you brutally murdered.
 This is within my rights under the laws that bind us.

Am I stuck here forever?"
 "Come on--let's go have some breakfast, and we'll see what else we can think of."
 She let him lead her back to his house.
 Sitting at the table while he made breakfast, she wiped her eyes and cheeks and nose with a paper napkin.
 "I'm never going to get back."
 "Sure you will."
 "How?
 I walked and walked and didn't get back.
 All I did was get lost--I couldn't even get back here."
 "You should have woken me up so I could go with you."

 I‚Äôm writing like a madman, now, it‚Äôs all good, it‚Äôs gonna come out alright.
 CM: 	Uh, let‚Äôs see.

 Sometimes the lyrics come out, you know, like a poem, when I‚Äôm shaving or in the bath.

The comprehensive conceptual model needs to be complemented by the development of models for employment, food, education, trade and other fields that go beyond the national or sectoral approach to show the impact of the complex interactions that are key determinants of the development process ‚Äì for instance, the impact of democracy on agriculture and of increasing agricultural productivity on employment, industrialization and trade, the impact of rising education on democratization, social tolerance for diversity, personal expectations and social stability.
 Once formulated, these conceptual models need to be applied under a variety of conditions to test their validity and demonstrate the value of a comprehensive approach to development.
 Therefore, we have proposed that the UN adopt a number of districts in different regions of the world, including crime-ridden inner cities or impoverished rural areas in industrial countries, to evolve and apply strategies for their rapid transition to a higher level of development.
 Six Goals in Education
 Once formulated, this knowledge needs to be imparted through education.
 Education is the greatest known civilizing force and the single most powerful lever for human development.
 Training imparts skills, but education increases the capacity of the individual at a more basic level, making the mind more active and alert, converting physical energy into mental energy, training us to see things from a wider perspective, to question and challenge the status quo, to think and imagine, to innovate and invent, to make decisions for ourselves and to act on our own initiative.
 Education is the process by which society passes on the accumulated knowledge and experience of countless centuries to new generations in a systematic, concentrated and abridged form, so that today‚Äôs young people can start their lives at the high point of knowledge and wisdom attained by preceding generations.
 Education replaces the slow, subconscious process of trial and error learning with a swift, conscious process.
 This accumulated knowledge is a great power that can be utilized to accelerate human development and abridge the time needed for society to arrive at progressively higher levels of material, social and psychological fulfilment.

I was halfway to the closest door before I remembered that it was still closed as a result of the mysterious 'potato gun rampage' as everyone had started calling it.
 A normal person, one who was really as self-confident as I pretended to be, would have just turned and headed towards the eastern set of doors.
 Not wanting to look like a ditzy blonde who couldn't even remember that someone had run a SUV into the flagpole and temporarily rendered one of the four main exits inoperable, I kept walking.
 The school was narrower than it was long.
 I could walk around the west end, and use the closest doors on the north side, and still have plenty of time to get to my locker before Biology started.
 I was busy replaying my conversation with Brandon as I walked around the corner of the building.
 The air was already hot enough to suck the moisture out of rocks, but that wasn't the cause of the sudden rush of heat to my face.
 I didn't think I'd ever seen the boy before, but Jasmin was easily recognizable, even half-hidden amid all the intermittently-functioning cooling units that lived on this end of the building.
 I couldn't see much beyond the boy's wild red hair, but even that was enough to tell he wasn't completely comfortable.
 I wanted to turn around and go back the other way, but there was a chance that Jasmin had already seen me, and if so I couldn't afford to look like I was scared of her.

The entire pack trooped into the room, filling it with impeccably dressed, mostly gorgeous, shape shifters, who gave off a perceptible tingle of energy if you knew what to look for.
 I'd really thought Alec was tilting at windmills right up until he politely, but firmly asked for a brief meeting with the principal and was ushered into the other man's office five seconds later.
 Alec drew the blinds, which didn't do anything to muffle the principal's raised voice.
 Fifteen minutes later, after the unmistakable feeling of Alec's power had crested to the point where it almost felt like there was a breeze blowing from the office, we were all sitting down with the bewildered school counselor and playing musical classes.
 Only it turned out Rachel and I were the only ones not changing our schedules.
 I started to protest being treated differently than everyone else, only to feel my mouth click shut as Rachel shook her head at me.
 It wasn't until Alec was walking me to Biology that I finally got an explanation.
 "You and Rachel are the ones who need the most sleep, ergo you don't change classes."
 "That's crazy."
 I would've stopped.

I want to spend as much time with you as possible.
 After all, it isn't like I'm going to be able to really get much rest between now and whenever we need to leave for the challenge."
 His wonderfully expressive face froze into the stony mask he wore so often with the rest of the world.
 "You weren't planning on bringing me, were you?"
 "It's not safe, Adri.
 I don't want to leave you anymore than you want to be left, but it's the only option."
 "No, it isn't, just bring me along."
 His fist clenched, knotting up the covers next to my head, but I was long past worrying he'd lose control of his beast and hurt me by accident.
 "You heard Mallory.
 The odds are very good that I'm not coming back.

I blinked and nodded.
 ‚ÄúAlright but if it starts getting crazy, wake me up.‚Äù ‚ÄúWake you up?‚Äù he asked and laughed.
 ‚ÄúI'm sleeping too.
 If it gets crazy, they'll wake us up.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said and yawned.
 I leaned my head against the tree and closed my eyes.
 The world seemed to fade around me, along with the bickering and Seth's hand, as I fell asleep.
 I opened my eyes to see that I was in a cave.
 I peered at the entrance of the cave to see that outside it was dark.
 I walked toward the entrance when something stopped me.
 ‚ÄúDon't go into the shadows, Jazell,‚Äù a familiar voice said.

So when she invited us to a Billy Graham crusade, to keep from disappointing her, and maybe for deeper reasons, I said ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù Neither Cliff nor I admitted we might want to attend.
 We decided we could read a newspaper account and tell Helga we had gone and found plenty to think about.
 But by the evening of the crusade, something like conscience bit us.
 The crusade was downtown at Balboa Stadium, where the Chargers played.
 It seated about 20,000.
 Since we were among the last to straggle in, we climbed to the top.
 From our seats, with a glance behind, we saw the harbor crowded with battleships and carriers.
 In front of us sat a trio of babes, probably still in high school.
 They looked wholesome, with cheeks made rosy from the chill and breeze, and curls that adorned their creamy necks and shoulders.
 Way down on the stage stood three big men.

He was watching me, surprise clear on his face.
 Whatever I‚Äôd been accused of, he hadn‚Äôt expected it.
 The council elders mistook the exchange as an answer.
 ‚ÄúChevelle Vattier, you have led this fusion?‚Äù His head whipped back toward the council table and he shot out a forceful, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù They focused once more on me.
 ‚ÄúI ask again, Elfreda, who taught you the magic to seal yourself to the crystal?‚Äù I was at a loss.
 I stood, helpless, as Chevelle spoke up.
 ‚ÄúElfreda.‚Äù He‚Äôd used my given name, I hoped simply because we were in a formal setting and not because of whatever horrible thing I had been accused of.
 He was pleading now.
 ‚ÄúWhere did you learn how to fuse the pendant with your blood?‚Äù Fuse the pendant with my blood?
 What was he talking about?

I fielded something like a hundred questions about school, reassured her two or three times that she wasn't a terrible mother, and promised yet again to stay one hundred percent out of trouble while she was gone.
 I was beginning to wonder if I was ever going to get off the phone when she finally decided, ultra-late shoot tomorrow or not, she'd better go to bed.
 By the time I finally finished up the rest of my studying, decided I was ready for my catch-up test in Mrs. Campbell's class tomorrow, and spent a few minutes with Rachel, I was well and truly exhausted.
 I thought about going back to the Lilac Room, but it would've just been because I was worried about what everyone else was thinking.
 I'd been raised to believe good little girls didn't spend the night with boys.
 Not even boys who were so gentlemanly it was sometimes painful.
 I still believed that, but my desire to be with Alec had devoured the parts of my brain that used logic and reason to decide things.
 I wanted to be with him while he slept, even if it was only for a couple of hours.
 Everyone in the pack already knew I'd spent the night.
 In the end, the reasonable part of me never had a chance.

 "Yes."
 She was horrified when two tears spilled out of her eyes, and she tried to wipe them away before he could see.
 But he noticed right away.
 "What's wrong, sweetheart?"
 She shook her head, but he reached out to tilt her chin up.

A slight movement, barely seen out of the corner of my eye, gave meaning to the last part of the sentence.
 A familiar-looking guy was standing a few feet from Rachel.
 I couldn't place him.
 I slowly shook my head, trying to jar something loose enough to figure out who he was.
 "Please, Adriana.
 It really isn't any trouble.
 James, can you get your car, please?"
 He looked angry.
 Like maybe he was going to argue, but as he opened his mouth Rachel turned and glared at him.
 It seemed odd to see someone only a little smaller than Alec back away from someone even smaller than me.

I was on my fourth box when it happened.
 Mom's jewelry box had somehow got packed into a box labeled 'old photography gear'.
 As I pulled it out to set it to one side, it slipped from my hands.
 The glittering deluge of chains and bracelets that went sliding across the floor would have made me feel bad enough all by themselves, but there was a proverbial scorpion nestled in the midst of all that shininess.
 I'd thrown mine out shortly after the accident.
 Part of me hadn't wanted to.
 It had felt like I was abandoning Cindi by doing so, but just seeing Cindi's half of the twin pendants we'd received two years before had been enough to send me into a tailspin.
 A detached part of me noted that it was just like Mom to have lied about having lost Cindi's.
 She'd known I couldn't handle the reminder of what we'd lost, but she'd been unwilling to give up that link to the past.
 The thought slipped away like sunlight skipping across water a split second before the storm arrived.

(laughs)  Yeah, I did drugs.
 Ok, I wrote ‚ÄúBurn my Bridges‚Äù on speed, which is an angry drug, and it‚Äôs such an angry song.
 I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs not one of my favorites now, even though it‚Äôs newish.
 I wrote it one night‚ÄîI think Lor and I had had a fight,  a rare fight, and she had gone to a girlfriend‚Äôs house and I just thought, fuck it, I‚Äôm gonna do speed and stay up all night.
 I didn‚Äôt plan on writing.

 And I recorded it that night in my living room, fingers tearing over my strings till they bled, I was playing so hard, like Richie, and that song, that was recorded in my home‚Äîit sounds like it.

‚ÄúI need to retrieve the swords I dropped,‚Äù Harruq said quietly.

When the gatekeeper refused to let us in because the tickets were sold out, Kenny‚Äôs usual good nature expired.
 He raised a fist as though to sock the gatekeeper, a boy in an ROTC costume.
 But instead of punching the kid, he drove his fist through one of the small windowpanes.
 The gatekeeper hollered.
 The next instant, we found ourselves surrounded by teachers, coaches, and a platoon of the ROTC.
 While the chatter of several witnesses turned it all into gibberish, and the gatekeeper shouted, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been drinking,‚Äù Kenny stood still, staring at his bloody fist as though wondering how it happened.
 Out of the crowd, a coach came striding.
 He shoved me aside and tried to grab Kenny.
 Kenny bolted, splitting the crowd.
 Down the steps and across the quad, his legs churned faster than the eye could register, like a propeller.

 "And you will, young man."
 Marie knew that the stern look her father gave John was intended to mask the love and pride he felt.
 Her own heart tightened with love.
 She never would have dreamed that her disappearance would bring her family closer together.
 John and Mrs. Tranton went to get dressed, doing so in record time.
 The four were in the living room discussing a late August trip to Cape Cod when the doorbell rang.
 Marie's hands shook as she set her teacup aside.
 She rose just as Davis appeared in the living room.

It took me several seconds to sort through things enough to realize I was smelling things I didn't even have a name for.
 After several seconds of trying to catalog the most delightful of my new discoveries, I realized I'd had my eyes closed since I'd gotten here, possibly an unconscious defense mechanism meant to protect me from sensory overload.
 The distant sound of water trickling down a rock face, of leaves gently caressing each other in the breeze faded away as I took in an amazing wonderland of light.
 The trees I'd been listening to were exactly where I expected them to be, but it took me several heartbeats to recognize them.
 Gone were the sturdy, brown behemoths I'd spent so much time climbing with Cindi.
 Instead, pillars of soft light reached up to the sky, swaying slowly back and forth with the wind, creaking in a rhythm I'd known by heart since I was seven.
 I felt tears collecting in the corners of my eyes as I reached out and touched the nearest tree.
 It was as if the world I'd known my entire life had been simply a moldy cover designed to hide the true nature of my surroundings.
 Now the mask was gone and I was immersed in vivid colors, living lights, and a sense of harmony so strong it nearly overwhelmed me.
 It was impossible to say for certain how long I sat looking at the gentle motion of the tree branches, marveling at the way things made up of light could still cast shadows when silhouetted by the harsher light of the sun.

The elf let go of his bow and held his hands out to either side.
 ‚ÄúNo more have to die,‚Äù the elf said.
 The flesh around his eyes sagged wearily, and he leaned against the window to aid in standing.
 It was as if grief had rendered him lifeless.
 Let go, Qurrah thought.
 He could let go.
 Fall down the cliff, and find what awaited him at the bottom.
 All he had to do was let go of the bones.
 The confusion burned hotter in his gut.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right,‚Äù Qurrah said, standing to his full height.

Agents, publishers and others encourage us writers to consider our work a business.
 Like Brother Lawrence, Olga didn‚Äôt urge anybody to retire to a monastery, only to try to stay in as close contact to God as they could in their own place and position.
 Besides Eric and Olga, Mother Teresa has taught me plenty.
 Judith Moore, a wise and benevolent editor at the San Diego Reader, sent me to Tijuana to report on the Missionaries of Charity seminary there.
 I spent a few glorious days talking to the brothers.
 I found them the kindest, most generous, least self-concerned group I have ever encountered.
 But they were also the happiest of people, which I couldn‚Äôt make sense of, until one afternoon when a mob of locals came to pick up groceries.
 These folks lived in a shantytown on the bank of an oily swamp I call the Black Lagoon.
 The neighborhood is so poor that when my cousin and I delivered a rusted tool shed to one of the families, they used it as a granny flat.
 I was helping the Brothers pass out vegetables when I got blessed with a feeling so profound, the recollection of it still uplifts me.

"I came to my senses.
 Take your ring, Davis."
 "Listen, Marie, you don't know what you're saying.
 We can push the date back a bit, get married in October instead of September."
 "What part of `I don't want to marry you' do you not understand?"
 She grinned, because he was obviously taken aback.
 "Yes, I've changed.
 It's over, Davis."
 He was beginning to get worried.
 With John and his father having reconciled, he had to marry Marie to solidify his position in the company.

Everything was just too unreal.
 I couldn't believe it was all happening, so I chose to ignore the implications of what he was saying.
 Boys like him didn't go for girls like me.
 They didn't even acknowledge the possibility unless they were after something.
 We'd been driving in more or less comfortable silence for several minutes before I decided to act before things got uncomfortable.
 "So, tell me about yourself."
 "There isn't much to tell.
 I was born here, and I'll probably die here."
 "More of the obligations you were talking about?"
 Brandon nodded, staring off in the distance for a second.

 Harruq sighed and looked away.
 He gently tapped his swords together.
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.
 Bored.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúAm I not a challenge?‚Äù
 He made vague shrug that could be taken either way.
 Let her think that was it, he thought.
 It was a whole lot better than the truth.
 Aurelia, however, seemed none too pleased.

I‚Äôm not sure who would mate with our mother, but some elf man did.
 We are smarter than most realize, you know that.
 Our features are sharper, and we only resemble the orcs that attacked Veldaren.
 It is a part of us.
 Unwanted, perhaps, but I shall not cower and hide a part of who I am.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúJust strange, is all,‚Äù Harruq said.
 ‚ÄúLife is strange.‚Äù
 They both lay down to rest, a new life awaiting them in Woodhaven.

I slid them out just as I became aware of some sort of commotion‚Ä¶ that sounded like it was getting closer.
 No, not a tingle indicating what I was looking for.
 It was a protection spell.
 I ran.
 As I shot through the rooms, all I could think of was not getting caught.
 I shoved the pages under my shirt before I made it through the last door.
 The village was crowded with elves, oblivious to my horror.
 The protection spell must have only alerted council.
 I ran from town and pushed through the brush at the edge of the village, taking the shortest direction out of the boundaries.
 I kept running until I became winded and then hastily searched for some kind of shelter.

 had opened.
 He'd been thinking about Marie's life in 1927--just as he had been when she'd walked into his garden and his life.
 He was the key.
 Rick squeezed his eyes shut, thinking about television and microwaves and airplanes.
 When he opened them, most of the fog had evaporated.
 Everything seemed normal.
 The water was gurgling from the frog's mouth.
 Jumping up, he ran inside and up the stairs.
 "Marie?"

Of course I'd go see how big of a discount the school had gotten the tickets at, but it was extremely unlikely my tiny check would end up being enough.
 It took me a moment to realize Mr. Gossil hadn't ended his announcement.
 "...those wishing to be entered into the drawing should stop by the office between today and noon tomorrow."
 In the face of the near-universal apathy expressed by the rest of the student body, it took my mind several seconds to process exactly what had been said.
 I grabbed Brandon's arm and shook it to get his attention.
 "Did he just say they were drawing for free tickets?"
 Brandon looked slightly amused.
 Cassie, who I'd just interrupted, looked very much not amused.
 "I think so.
 I wasn't paying very close attention, but I think he did."

Just relax and take your time."
 It took a while for her to get the hang of it, but an hour or so later, she was cruising around the parking lot, making reasonably smooth starts and stops.
 Rick was glad to see that her initial difficulties had made her cautious.
 That should curb her excitement when she got out on the road.
 They drove a little the next day, and Monday Rick picked up a booklet at the DMV.
 Marie spent all day Tuesday studying it and was sure that she could pass the test.
 Rick had found out, however, that she couldn't get one without a social security number.
 Marie was disappointed, of course, but Rick wasn't sure it was a good idea for her to drive alone, anyway, and she'd eventually want to do that if she had a license.
 Besides, he was putting together a surprise for her that he knew would take her mind off driving.
 Marie was doing laundry Thursday afternoon when the phone rang.

Once we got to school, I'd found the rampant gossip had subsided to a dull rumble, but the few undecided votes had come down solidly on the side of everyone else.
 Some people hated me for using Brandon, others hated me for playing Alec, while a small, but decidedly upwardly-mobile group disliked me for achieving not just one, but both of the conquests they'd been dreaming of since grade school.
 In the end, it didn't really matter why everyone disliked me.
 Still, only the fact that Alec's pack closed ranks around me kept the situation from becoming unbearable.
 Biology went better than it had since my first day in Sanctuary, largely because Alec seemed to have developed a postdoctorate knowledge of Biology.
 Also he didn't have a single qualm when it came to using that knowledge to deflect questions aimed at me.
 Mrs. Sorenson tried three different times to make me look stupid before finally giving up and getting down to the business of teaching.
 She continued to shoot us nasty looks throughout the class, but I hardly noticed.
 Alec spent the rest of the class time writing questions for me in the margins of my notebook.
 By the time I'd described my grandparents, kindergarten teacher, and top three most embarrassing moments, I wanted to get a chance to ask some questions of my own, but he just shook his head and passed me my notebook back with a new set of quickly-jotted queries.

It was too late to hide; I might as well at least have something decent to eat.
 Its smell was unfamiliar, but I didn‚Äôt care.
 It smelled like food.
 He reached down and tore a hunk from the spit, tossing it to me with a wink.
 When I blushed, he smiled a wicked smile.
 My mouth went dry.
 He was tall and broad with dark hair and eyes.
 Like Chevelle.
 Handsome too, I supposed, though I could tell even from these few gestures he was a bit cocky.
 He reminded me of Evelyn, always so proud of herself for finding me out.

 This is something you‚Äôll need to know for a group conflict.

 But he was talking and I would take it.
 I nodded for him to go on.
 ‚ÄúA single opponent allows you to use more energy, focus only on that and let yourself‚Ä¶‚Äù My thoughts were wandering.
 Cursed dust.
 ‚Äú‚Ä¶ but with a number of opponents, you have to conserve your energy so you don‚Äôt leave yourself too weak‚Ä¶‚Äù I was watching his mouth move as he spoke but losing the words.

"Mrs. Alexander, I read something about water around reactor cores giving off a blue light.
 Can you explain how that works?"
 I'd expected something stupid, but glowing water made me think of the vivid dreams.
 I listened as intently as I'd ever listened to anything, and did my best to follow all of the diagrams as Mrs. Alexander attempted to break a college-level concept down into something fairly average high-school students could follow.
 "So, in short, really it's a matter of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms attempting to shed the excess energy they've gained from the radioactive particles emitted from the core.
 The energized electrons give off radiation in the visible light spectrum during the process of dropping down to a lower energy state."
 Hmm, an interesting concept, but still not an explanation for how the water in my dream had given off a soft golden glow, one that had rippled with the movement of the water.
 Almost before I'd realized it, my hand shot up.
 "Is the light always blue?
 Is it ever a whitish-gold color?"

Unless she was out hiking somewhere, in which case it might be a day or two before she realized I was missing.
 There was nothing to do but walk.
 I waited a few minutes to give Britney time to get out of the lab, and then walked in and grabbed my things.
 The other kids were already clearing out.
 Nobody even looked up as I left.
 Luckily I'd worn sneakers rather than the exotic footwear most girls gravitated towards.
 If I'd been wearing anything else, I'd have been nursing blisters before I made it out of the parking lot.
 As it was, I quickly realized my little walk home was going to be twice as unpleasant as I'd expected.
 The school most definitely wasn't in the pretty, green part of the region.
 Every step kicked up a miniature cloud of fine, red dust that drifted into my lungs and slowly coated my clothes.

I've been worried all day someone would stump me on something right out of the gate on my first day."
 Rachel looked up at me through dark lashes as I stood.
 "I've wanted to say thanks for a while.
 I really appreciate you making Cassie back down yesterday.
 Nobody else has ever stood up for me like that.
 At least not people that I didn't already know."
 Based on what I'd seen less than thirty hours ago, it didn't look like her friends stood up for her either.
 "No worries, it just seemed like the thing to do at the time.
 Why did she want to hurt you anyways?"
 Rachel looked down, but somehow it wasn't a gesture that conveyed guilt.

 Harruq did so, and together they stepped inside.
 He felt an unseen hand grab his chest, and then they were running blind.
 The minutes crawled, their frantic breathing the only audible sound.
 Qurrah lagged further and further behind, unable to keep the pace.
 Harruq tightened his grip on his wrist and pulled him along.

He leapt into a rear window and I followed as low and slow as I could.
 When I reached the last tree I could use for cover, I darted up against the hut and peered through a gap in the twigs that patched it together.
 They were whispering.

 Junnie.
 Chevelle was whispering his reply to her, and though I couldn‚Äôt quite hear, he must have given her a short account of the morning‚Äôs events.
 I moved closer to the window, finding a larger gap there.
 ‚ÄúWere you able to track her?‚Äù Junnie asked in a low voice.
 ‚ÄúNot exactly.
 She‚Äôs following me.‚Äù Heat flooded my face.

 Harruq removed his armor, lay down on the bed of straw, and slept.
 The necromancer stepped outside his home, walked to the side, and stared at the flickering lights in the distance.
 Campfires and torches.
 An army, the same that had removed him and his brother from their home, slept so close.
 Every one of them contemplated their death.
 Qurrah closed his eyes and inhaled the cold night air.
 Yes, the tension was delectable.
 The quiet moments before battle were a rare thing that so very few were lucky enough to experience.
 Fear, worry, hope, prayer, regret, and sorrow all floated to the stars.

Mom, we never knew how hard life was for you because you made sure we came first and you protected us the best you could!
 To my son Bryce, I would like to thank you for all of your accomplishments and helping me as a father not have a complete melt down because at least I knew I wasn‚Äôt a complete failure as a Dad.
 You gave me the hope and courage to continue to try to understand your brother and his drug addiction and eventually the addiction of others.
 And a special Thank You to my editor, Robin Martin of Two Songbirds Press, for believing in my story and my ability to convey it.
 I couldn‚Äôt have completed this without you!
 Part I: Defining Moments Chapter 1: The Medicine Cabinet I sit alone in my new quad truck with its 22-inch rims; it looks like some 20-year-old spoiled brat has decked it out.
 I am tucked away in a remote parking space at a retail shopping center.
 No one would normally park this far from the grocery store, which anchors an array of businesses, at least not this late at night in this sparsely populated lot.
 I know this place well, as this is where my wife and I buy our groceries.
 It is in an upper class neighborhood serving the wealthy residents who live in their posh homes nearby.

I was wrong on both accounts.
 The company, as Donovan had dubbed it, also included Dominic and Jasmin.
 Dominic had smiled shyly in my direction as we'd climbed into an ostentatious black Mercedes.
 Jasmin just looked like she'd rather be anywhere than on babysitting duty.
 Rachel had explained that Alec didn't want us delicate, fragile girls traveling alone, so he'd assigned us bodyguards, who happened to also be female and delicate-looking, but who weren't nearly as fragile.
 Also, it turned out we weren't going to Sanctuary, or St. George, or even anywhere in Utah, a fact I didn't realize until we'd been on the road for twenty minutes.
 "Oh, Adri, don't be silly.
 You can't do real shopping in Sanctuary.
 Besides, Alec wouldn't have let the four of us go alone if we'd been planning on staying so close to Brandon's territory.
 Vegas was definitely the best option given the time restrictions we're under."

For perhaps the first time in my entire life I didn't mind at all that I'd ended up in a swimsuit so small I might as well have been wearing nothing at all.
 In fact, the feel of the warm water sliding past my skin was so incredible I almost considered skinny dipping.
 Of course that'd only lasted for about a nanosecond.
 Even in a dream, there were things that were just too scary to really entertain.
 The dream lasted longer than any of the others before it, but even so it eventually lapsed into a normal, boring dream.
 Still, I woke up feeling more refreshed and rested than any other time I could remember.
 Even more amazing, the feeling was strong enough to carry me through Biology and Mrs. Sorenson's relentless grilling.
 I did better than expected, but still not as well as I'd hoped.
 Not considering how much time I'd spent studying.
 It was like she knew exactly which parts I didn't understand completely, and after letting me start to get a little bit of false confidence, she'd hammer me down again.

‚ÄúWhen it comes to this mind stuff, no one‚Äôs stronger than you.‚Äù
 Qurrah chuckled.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see.‚Äù
 He closed his eyes, letting his mind sink into the ether.
 Like scent to a bloodhound, Qurrah could sense the magic flowing all about him.
 The flame surrounding the skulls flared even brighter, but beneath their tails trailed long threads of silver.
 When Qurrah looked up, he saw hundreds of the threads twisting and curling together, coiling toward a hidden presence deep within the orc army.
 Taking in a deep breath, Qurrah pooled his strength and focused on the skull taunting his brother, visualizing the thread and seeking to sever it.
 There was a pull on his chest‚Äîthe taste of copper on his tongue.
 When he opened his eyes, the skull fell to the battlements.

He hit me so fast I didn‚Äôt see it coming, and I flew backwards onto the desktop.
 All four legs of the desk broke beneath the impact of my body.
 I lay there stunned on my back.
 As Dino walked towards me I could see the crowd of guests rushing in behind him.
 He straddled me and I gathered my legs towards my chest with my arms crossed in front of my face to protect myself.
 He looked like a killer standing over me, his eyes big, his teeth gritted and his right fist well above his head poised to pound me again.
 I straightened my right leg out as a kick upward directly into his crotch as hard and fast as I could.
 His body folded around my foot.
 He fell backwards on the ground exposing the crowd of onlookers who stood behind him.
 I stood up and walked by him, looking down at him curled and rolling in obvious agony.

She and her mother would exclaim over a dress that was perfect for her, and then she'd realize that she wouldn't be able to wear it for Rick.
 She'd see an elegant necktie that would be perfect for Rick and then realize she could never give it to him.
 She'd known she'd miss him, but she'd thought that the excitement of being home would lessen that feeling.
 She was wrong.
 "Where would you like to go now?"
 her mother asked her when they'd finished their lunch.
 "Home."
 "Home?
 We've only been to two shops."
 "I'm a little tired.

They could no longer cower within them and hope to be spared.
 In the commotion, Qurrah vanished, unseen and uncared for.
 He had spent his whole life disappearing in crowds, and in the dark of night, surrounded by fear and worry, he was just a shadow.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 Qurrah was in no hurry as he left the city behind.
 The grass was soft and tall, and it felt good under his feet after so much sprinting down stone roads.
 Stars filled the sky, and he smiled to them often.
 In the distance, he spotted a small fire, and he knew to whom it belonged.
 ‚ÄúWhere is your brother?‚Äù Velixar asked as Qurrah approached.

The shift from manufacturing to services is a positive and inevitable expression of the elevation of human activity from the physical to the mental level, which is the central reason for the phenomenal rise in global living standards over the past century.
 Rich nations have become rich through a shift of workers from the primary farm sector to value-added, non-farm secondary and tertiary sectors.
 Poverty and hunger persist so long as a majority of the population depend upon the routine operations of farming for their livelihood.
 This is also the cause of the growing feminization of poverty in developing countries.
 Today‚Äôs developed nations arrived at their present position by a long, slow migration from agriculture to manufacturing to service sector, but that does not mean developing countries must follow the same path.
 The growing demand for services in the developed world coupled with rapid strides in telecommunications has created the possibility of skipping steps to abridge the development process.
 Even within developing countries, surging demand for education, health care, tourism, communication, financial and retail services has opened up opportunities that were available to the developed countries only at a much later stage in their development.
 Outsourcing: During the last decade enormous attention has been focused on the lucrative employment potentials generated by Information and Communication Technology (ICT), particularly the high paid jobs in computer software and hardware and the less technical jobs in business process outsourcing.
 Countries such as India have shown that they can leapfrog into the technological vanguard by developing qualified human resources to meet the ever-expanding shortage in these sectors.
 Information Technology and IT-enabled services stand out as the most important new fields of employment to emerge since the popularization of the automobile.

‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù I looked at the beads of sweat on his forehead.
 ‚ÄúWhat's wrong with you?‚Äù ‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúI'm just hot because when someone sleeps on someone else, that person kind of gets hot.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù He shook his arm.
 ‚ÄúYou fell asleep leaning against my arm.
 Were you cold?‚Äù My face went red.
 ‚ÄúI didn't mean to, sorry.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt's not a problem, at least no one was cold,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúI need to tell you something,‚Äù I said.
 ‚ÄúI had another dream and I saw you in it.
 It was kind of spooky, actually.‚Äù ‚ÄúReally,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúYou were in my dream too.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere was a voice calling my name,‚Äù I said, remembering the creepy dream.

If I want to become a baseball star, I should look for a coach or mentor whose character and lessons I can believe in.
 If I believe in Mother Teresa, I should read about her and talk to those who knew her and attend to whatever I learn.
 To the extent that we follow Christ‚Äôs example, give of our selves, our time and resources to help people in need, allow time away from the crowds to contemplate and pray, put aside our self concerns and turn to concern for others, our minds and hearts get invaded and possessed by the Holy Spirit.
 And in that condition, the world transforms before our eyes.
 For passing out food, clothing or loving concern we always get blessed, and while we live with a blessed attitude, the most bedraggled people may appear possessed of astonishing beauty, as God must see them.
 When we follow the example of Jesus, through his blessing we begin to perceive the glorious reality of all creation.
 In other words, we enter heaven in all its beauty.
 Beauty
 James 4: 17 in the King James declares, ‚ÄúTherefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.‚Äù The New International Version reads ‚ÄúAnyone, then, who knows the good he ought to do and doesn‚Äôt do it, sins."
 The New American Standard‚Äôs version is, ‚ÄúTherefore, to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin.‚Äù Put these translations together, they insist that to do good is the right thing and what we ought to do.

He nodded to me.
 Grey.
 He was thoughtful for a moment, deciding the best way to display his skill, before finally approaching to offer his hand.
 I reached forward, placing my palm against his, and then he was gone.
 His entire body had vanished.
 I half expected to feel his touch‚Äîperhaps he‚Äôd merely camouflaged himself‚Äîbut my hand was empty.
 I looked around, baffled.
 The makeshift audience wore easy, amused smiles.
 They watched me, not the vacant space from which Grey had evidently disappeared.
 And then I noticed someone beside me who hadn‚Äôt been there before‚Ä¶ it was him.

I half expected for the incredible tension I'd been feeling before to disappear, but instead it morphed slightly.
 If I hadn't known it was absolutely absurd, I would've said it felt like there was a tingly wind blowing down the stairs, pushing Vincent along before it.
 Isaac moved slightly.
 It was a small change of position, but somehow incredibly menacing.
 It wasn't until Vincent froze in place that I realized Isaac's shift had kept Vincent squarely between him and Alec.
 It was like watching a pair of wolves bringing down an elk.
 I'd seen gangs work together like this before, but it seemed strangely out of place in Sanctuary.
 I was positive there was going to be a fight after all, but then Vincent grabbed some poor freshman, shoved him into Isaac, and pushed his way downstairs as Isaac caught the human missile.
 As soon as Vincent was safely out of sight, everyone surged forward to congratulate Isaac on having saved Ben, and Ben on having not died.
 ** The near fight between Isaac and Vincent and then Alec's intervention seemed to be the buzz for the next two hours.

I looked around blankly for several more heartbeats before I finally managed to place the noise.
 Wolves.
 There weren't supposed to be any wolves in the area, but there wasn't any ignoring my ears.
 I numbly pulled myself back up, and began stumbling back towards the party, only to stop as another howl echoed down through the canyon.
 It was between me and everyone else.
 I turned and started into a shuffling run.
 Maybe the wolf would be attracted to the noise and light.
 Maybe I'd be able to get far enough away it wouldn't smell me.
 I'd only been moving for about a minute before another howl sent chills running down my spine.
 It sounded like a different wolf, and it was closer than the first one.

She was addicted to hard stuff by the time me and my sister were born.
 And she eventually passed on her addictions to us in one degree or another.
 Let me just say that being an asprin junkie at the age of 6 is a low point in my life, but I‚Äôm extremely proud to have beaten it.
 Well as a kid she used to scare my sister and me with horror stories about the Republican Party and conservatives in general, with the stories about rush Limbaugh being the worst of the lot.
 In fact it wasn‚Äôt until just a couple years ago that I could watch a speech by one of their number without wetting myself and shaking in fear.
 But onto other things well she always was a wonderful cook, with mushrooms and brownies being her specialties, we had those a lot, when there was enough to eat anyways.
 We were poor but happy, often mother would make us clothes out of flowers and stuff, they were colorful and pretty during the summer and they smelled real good.
 But when winter came we would be real cold and sometimes our clothes would fall off, which was real bad when we were away from home trying to make some money to help support us.

"I'll be done with Dom in just a moment, Jess, then I'll fix your hair while Rachel finishes up with Adri."
 The nickname should have hurt, but somehow it wasn't as bad when the pack used it.
 It was almost like having a new family, one without all of the grief-poisoned memories that popped up every time I really thought about Dad or Cindi.
 Faster than I would've believed possible, we were all in our dresses, and waiting in the living room for the boys to make their appearance.
 Jasmin and Rachel had worked what I was pretty sure was actual magic.
 Even Jessica was nothing less than stunning, and I didn't look as bad as normal.
 Jasmin's backless black dress and shoulder-length gloves had streaks of blue that brought out her eyes, while Dominic's tight, red gown seemed to give her the confidence and poise you'd expect from someone so gorgeous and utterly exotic.
 Jess had opted for a sleeveless silver number that flared out at the bottom so much I wasn't sure how Isaac would be able to walk next to her without stepping on the shimmery material.
 Rachel's mauve dress was probably the most conservative of all, neither over-snug, nor especially low-cut.
 It had seemed entirely out of character considering what she'd purchased for the rest of us, but when I'd asked, she'd just grimaced and said Alec would've made her stay home if she'd chosen anything more daring.

 At least I wasn‚Äôt making a nude presentation in front of an entire psychology class again.

 Jim ‚Äì Tell me about it, the weirdest one yet is when you, me, Johnny and Gene were exploring this haunted mansion, Scooby Doo style.

 But then on top of that Johnny and Gene actually got along well.

‚ÄúHow skilled are you with those?‚Äù Qurrah asked, gesturing at the swords in the grass next to Harruq.
 Even though they lived in such cramped quarters, Qurrah still knew very little of Harruq‚Äôs life other than what he did at his request.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôve watched the guards training new men,‚Äù Harruq said, drawing a blade and holding it with one hand.
 ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôve been practicing every night after you‚Äôre in bed and no one is around to watch and get curious.
 Near the castle they have these stumps for smacking with your sword.
 Not sure what for, but it helps them, and it seemed to help me.
 I snuck over there plenty of times.
 No one guards a big, beaten log.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúBut you have yet to face men in combat,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúDo not be overzealous about your skills.

This kid, I believed, had spent more time in church than outside in the real world.
 He hadn‚Äôt attended a dozen funerals, known anyone like Eric, read Nietzsche or Dostoyevski.
 Most of all, he wasn‚Äôt Billy Graham.
 Besides, I glanced to the right of the kid and saw the babe with auburn curls.
 She stood with hands folded at her waist and creamy white legs quivering below the hem of her flowered sundress.
 Then I knew for certain that if I smiled and she smiled back and I asked her name and number and picked her up later at her churchgoing folks‚Äô house and promised to bring her home by midnight, I would drive to a lookout at the sea cliffs and invite her into the back seat.
 And if she complied, I would do exactly what I would have done yesterday, before I surrendered.
 I might be forgiven, but I felt no less corrupt than before.
 Lucky for her, we lost her in the crowd.
 In the car, Cliff and I didn‚Äôt mention surrendering.

‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt safe.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd if it doesn‚Äôt work?‚Äù She didn‚Äôt answer.
 I remembered the story of her father then, how he‚Äôd been released after the fairy‚Äôs death.
 I faced Chevelle.
 ‚ÄúIf the council member who bound me dies, then will I be released?‚Äù He plainly regretted what he‚Äôd divulged that morning, but something else rested just below his reluctance.
 Something hopeful.
 Something that burned beneath my skin.
 He answered, ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù ‚ÄúThen we kill them.‚Äù And if we don‚Äôt know which ones?
 ‚ÄúWe kill them all.‚Äù I glanced around the clearing as the others watched me.
 The atmosphere had changed, and I realized only then the uncertainty I‚Äôd grown to expect.
 This was different.

Their sparring ended, Harruq and Aurelia sat side-by-side against a tree, both glistening with sweat.
 ‚ÄúGetting better,‚Äù the half-orc said.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to be beating my ass in a few weeks if you keep learning as fast as you are.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù she said, patting his hand.
 ‚ÄúYour ass is safe with me.‚Äù

 Aurelia, meanwhile, absently drew lines in the dirt.
 He watched for a moment, suddenly nervous and quiet.
 The words of his brother echoed in his head.

You will be at a disadvantage.
 The real problem is going to the completion with the lance and the mace.
 Both have no limit to the armor; and of course, the lance is a mounted competition.
 ‚ÄúYou should see some of the horses!‚Äù said Imeralda.
 ‚ÄúThey are beautiful.‚Äù She smiled but at her words Doi‚Äôvan clearly did not see beautiful animals but a problem.
 ‚ÄúShe is correct; most have trained war horses and a few are Dire Steeds.
 I will be honest Rodregas, I am not sure that this will work.
 These warriors are trained in the use of the lance and their war horses will negate your personal advantage in physical might, as your horse is a trail mount.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan paused and said, ‚ÄúBut, the real problem is that you are without plate armor.
 I am not sure how you can survive such a competition.
 The competition with mace or hammer will be only marginally better for you.

I needed to see Junnie.
 The door was partially open when I reached Junnie‚Äôs house, so I peeked my head in and called for her.
 When she didn‚Äôt answer, I slipped in to check the back room.
 As I walked through the sparsely decorated living area, I passed a carved mirror on the wall and noticed something off in my reflection.
 I knew I was flushed, I could feel the frustration and worry, but I stopped to get a closer look.
 There was something not right with my complexion, but what was really off was just above my face.
 I squinted, leaning toward the mirror as my hands reached up of their own accord.
 The first quarter inch of my hair was blackened.
 I parted my hair in a different area and then again, but the base of my hair was dark over my entire scalp.
 My fingers began to tremble against my skin; I could come up with no plausible explanation for the change.

He looked away for a moment, almost as though deciding whether or not to tell the truth.
 "I presumed you wouldn't want to stay and be subject to everyone's questions.
 You seem not to like people prying about your attacks, and you were less happy than usual today.
 I thought you could use the break."
 Apparently he'd decided against the truth option.
 "I¬†looked unhappy today?
 You, who never crack a smile unless you're going to get something out of it, were concerned about the fact I wasn't all smiles and giggles?
 Maybe you should flunk a test or two.
 Only it doesn't really count unless your dad, you know, the one who used to make your birthdays really special, is gone."
 Alec's mouth opened, closed, and then assumed its normal place in his unreadable mask.

Due to the warmer climate and lower labour costs of the developing world, inland aquaculture can become a major stimulus to rural employment, incomes, processing industries and exports.
 10.Micro-level indicators of food security.
 Development initiatives have been severely limited by the absence of accurate and sensitive measures to assess the impact of national-level policies and programmes on food security at community and household level.
 New indices, such as the Sustain able Livelihood Security Index now under development in India, need to be evolved and applied; they should combine measures of income and employment; food and nutritional status, including the availability of safe drinking water and sanitation facilities; ownership of productive assets; and education and productive skills.
 The pace of human development continues to accelerate.
 The world has changed more during the present century than in the previous nineteen centuries combined ‚Äì economically, socially, politically, scientifically and technologically.
 In recent decades humankind has been buffeted by a bewildering array and intensity of transforming powers ‚Äì democratization, decolonization, demilitarization, globalization, universal education, scientific advances, information, successive technological revolutions brought about by the automobile, telephone, radio, television, jet aircraft, computers, satellite communications and genetic engineering.
 Coping with such rapid change has not been easy.
 It has brought in its wake a broad array of problems ‚Äì a widening gap between the most advanced and least developed sections both within and between nations, a disequilibrium between growth of population and economic growth, rising unemployment, alienated youth, increasing violence and crime, depletion of natural resources, degradation of the environment, overcrowded cities, mass migrations of talent from South to North, displacement of millions of political and economic refugees, the breakdown of the family and the erosion of traditional social institutions.
 Although much has been learned about the various stages of social and economic development, much less is known about the actual process itself by which societies transit from one stage or level or form to another.

But the orchard had been wild for a very long time.
 While there was a bunch of fruit trees and berry bushes, most were the descendants of the original orchard and it was hard to find anything that reassembled a straight row.
 The apples trees were in fruit and they all started grabbing a few of each to eat as they went.
 Rodregas was not much of a farmer and did not know what the different types were named, but he liked the small green ones with the yellow splotches; they were sweet with a wonderful tang.
 ‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan, ‚ÄúHiding on a ley line definitely makes sense for keeping the Immortalists off our back and these apples are delicious.‚Äù Rodregas stared at him as he ate.
 Humans ate around the core, but Doi‚Äôvan was eating the whole apple as he talked.
 ‚ÄúAnd I love the feel of all the magic.
 My body was meant to live in a place that has more magic than our world does, but the lines are chaotic.
 It is hard to sleep on a wild line.
 It is going to be hard to stay here for long.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs deep voice had the tone of making a simple observation, not conversation.

Britney looked like she was trying to decide whether to be mad or impressed, but I felt too sick to stick around and try to nudge her in either direction.
 I mumbled something I hoped sounded intelligible and headed towards the bathroom.
 I passed Mr. Simms and another teacher on my way out, but apparently I looked as awful as I felt.
 They just shot me stern looks rather than stopping me to ask what had happened.
 It wasn't until I'd finished dry-heaving and was trying to clean myself back up, that I wondered where they'd been.
 The school building wasn't that big.
 If they'd really been trying to break up the fight, they should have arrived minutes earlier.
 I thought about hiding in the bathroom for a while, but that was exactly the kind of place a girl like Cassie would want to catch me.
 Instead I took a deep breath and walked outside.
 Britney was waiting for me.

What did I have to lose?
 The plan was formed: I‚Äôd practice until I was strong enough to return to the village.
 There was nothing holding me back.
 Nothing to do but this one thing.
 I spotted a small toad as it leapt across the clearing in a desperate attempt to escape the inferno.
 I concentrated on it, willing it to change.
 Its wide body started to swell, sides bubbling out, puffing it into a tiny green balloon.
 It did not transform into that monarch butterfly I had imagined.
 It burst, spewing entrails across the hem of my dress.
 My head fell into my hands as I groaned.

The preternatural silence beforehand.
 The prelude.
 The creation of something new.
 From where there was nothing something now exists: songs, recordings, an album.
 The making of Turntable Poison was a liminal time, a time of congruity, or grand passion.
 The melding of the three (sometimes four) musicians was a Synchronicity.
 It can happen more than once but it happened at least once for Black Lung.
 It‚Äôs there on that vinyl circle, waiting for the needle like a junkie.
 And for anyone lucky enough to find that masterpiece in someone‚Äôs garage sale, in some second-hand record shop (where I hear it can go for upwards of a hundred dollars or more), at some friend‚Äôs apartment, there is knowledge passed.
 Because anyone who hears Turntable Poison hears right away what could have been, what should have been.

"You don't need to do that; I can always just ride the bus."
 Brandon flipped open the passenger door and motioned for me to get in.
 I started around the vehicle, stumbling and nearly falling before I finally made it to my destination.
 Brandon waited for me to get my seatbelt on and then gunned the engine, flipping around a hundred and eighty degrees in a maneuver I'd never seen anyone perform outside of the movies.
 "Of course I don't have to pick you up.
 It's more a matter of wanting to, if I can say that without making things all weird.
 I have obligations at school, people who depend on me.
 I can't spend the time I'd like getting to know you there, so it just made sense to free up some time in the mornings to make that happen."
 Everything was just too unreal.
 I couldn't believe it was all happening, so I chose to ignore the implications of what he was saying.

We ended up throwing away 90% of this junk, as he really didn‚Äôt want much of it anyway.
 Rummaging through his old belongings was a grim reminder of his former life.
 Brandon eagerly cleansed himself of almost everything and was resolved to start fresh.
 His stay at Narconon had also exposed him to a minimalist lifestyle completely unlike his prior existence.
 He had learned he didn‚Äôt need ‚Äúthings‚Äù to prove anything to anybody.
 His ex-girlfriend, Tiffanie, met us at the storage unit to claim her belongings.
 She looked about twenty pounds heavier and it was good weight.
 Tiffanie had been clean and sober since her last relapse in the rehab center.
 They smiled at each other and commented on their vast physical changes.
 They knew their life as a couple was over and that they had both gone their separate ways, while both going in the same positive direction‚Äîoff drugs‚Äîdespite astronomical odds.

‚ÄúWill you kill me, too?‚Äù

 Either I love you or I kill you.‚Äù
 Sparks rained down as he clanged his swords together.
 ‚ÄúIs that how you feel?‚Äù she asked.
 The tears in her eyes ran down her cheeks, not to be replaced by any more.
 ‚ÄúSo be it.‚Äù She took up her staff and held it defensively.
 ‚ÄúYou are a fool, Harruq.
 May you die as one.‚Äù

My hair brown hair flopped in my face as I sat up, seeing Emily dash over to me.
 Seconds later Jason walked through the trees, rubbing his face.
 Seth grinned at all of us; we were back.
 That‚Äôs how it all started.
 I don‚Äôt know how we got the gift to become these different people, but we did.
 That‚Äôs the mystery and hopefully we‚Äôll solve it one day.
 We were chosen for some unknown reason, but that reason doesn‚Äôt matter.
 All that matters is that we protect this town.
 Jason‚Äôs eyes flashed.
 I stood up and leaned over to him.

Rodregas then said, ‚ÄúI agree we are just starting to figure out that there is something big going on.
 I can‚Äôt believe even the Immortalists would be crazy enough to go up against both the Celestial Gods and the Daemon Lordsof the Infernal though.‚Äù Imeralda nodded and said, ‚ÄúWhat price is so high as to be even better than God hood?‚Äù The three sat silent for a few minutes soaking in that question.
 Rodregas looked at Imeralda and asked, ‚ÄúWell, we can‚Äôt answer that today, but how did you break Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs spell?‚Äù Imeralda nodded and with a smile said, ‚ÄúI always hoped that if I had to take on a sorcerer it would be in the Forest where I would have an edge, but no, it had to be in a hallway!
 I knew my regular spells; he would counter without a problem.
 So I had to work around the spell.
 The spell was one to hold you from walking or running.
 I actually tried to dance or hop,‚Äù she said with a smile.
 ‚ÄúBut he was too good, he had those covered.
 But, I have been practicing a spell to float in the air, and that worked.
 The spell was not designed to stop someone from floating in place.

Except that playful tape loop, and that fade-out on ‚ÄúFor Kim,‚Äù that‚Äôs just us, beating our brains out in that little studio, high on bennies.
 ‚ÄúFor Kim, Because it Went by So Fast‚Äù---we worked our asses off to get that one right.
 I don‚Äôt know what was wrong really.
 It was a song I‚Äôd written right before we went into the studio, so we‚Äôd never done it live‚Äîmaybe that was the reason we struggled with it.
 But, the lyrics, you know, they‚Äôre a little complex: ‚ÄúI took my Melville out into the sun, what else could I do, I was in my twenties‚Äù it begins.
 Not exactly pop schmaltz,  you know, ABAB.
 It was a more complex rhythm to the whole speaking‚Äîand I did just sort of speak the lyrics‚Äîthat was Jim.
 At first I wanted to sing it‚Äîyou know, I‚Äôd worked out a melody, a weird melody.
 And he said, on, I don‚Äôt know, the like 16th try, Jim said, shit, let‚Äôs not sing this one.

 I‚Äôm not some stoned teenager in Waikiki.
 I‚Äôm too old for this shit.
 The minutes click.
 I just want to live through this and see my wife and children again.
 Lisa must be thinking all kinds of things, as, being wired, I cannot call her to give her an update.
 I love her so much, and I always return in my mind to the day I met her and then everything is in perspective and nothing else matters but our love.
 Chapter 12: Who‚Äôs Your Daddy Lisa and I discovered ‚Äúwe‚Äù were pregnant about four months into our marriage.
 Even though we had not planned to start a family so early, we were thrilled, excited and anxious at the thought of creating a life conceived by the two of us.
 After passing out during the movie at the birthing class, (yes, really!)

‚ÄúNow will you let me down?‚Äù
 For a moment, she said nothing, catching her breath and doing her best to calm the flood of adrenaline that still rushed through her.
 Harruq twisted against the vines, but they still held firm.
 Blood continued to trickle down his chin.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not blind,‚Äù she said, suddenly looking away.
 ‚ÄúNot stupid, either.
 I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm here.
 Lie to me if you must, just don‚Äôt expect me to believe it.
 Forgive me for hoping you could trust me.‚Äù
 The vines released, freeing the half-orc who smacked against the ground.

My confusion must have been obvious.
 Dominic looked up from Jess.
 "Vincent and Cassie cut Jess and Isaac off from the rest of us."
 Rachel leaned in so she could whisper.
 "Jess is terrified of what Vincent and Brandon will do to her if they get a chance.
 She collapsed, and then everyone stormed the area."
 The limo hit a particularly nasty bump, and a wave of pain drove questions about what exactly Brandon had threatened out of my mind.
 I'd never noticed how bad the roads between school and Alec's house were.
 Each jostle sent waves of agony up my leg, and Jess's quiet sobs kept time to my suppressed gasps.
 It was one of the worst half hours of my life, and by the time we made it to Alec's house, I felt like I'd been wrung out.

Of course, it‚Äôs only in retrospect that you see what Memphis had, what we had going on there, right around the corner.
 I mean, everybody wants to know if I know Elvis, you know.
 Everybody asks me that, everybody even in the business.
 He‚Äôs revered, and that‚Äôs right, that‚Äôs right.
 But, I mean, even McCartney wanted to know if I‚Äôd ever met Elvis once he heard I was from Memphis.
 I wanted to say, man, Memphis is more than Elvis, as great as he was.
 Of course, the truth is, I did meet him.
 Once.
 It was at a benefit show and it was backstage.
 I was roadying for Ike Turner‚Äîbriefly, yeah, I did that.

Heart pounding, I went directly to my room and closed the door behind me.
 The single flame still flickered above my bedside table, and as I walked closer, I noticed a package on my bed.
 I spun my hand and lit the room to better see.
 It was a large ivory box tied with tweed.
 There was a small note under the knot.
 Dearest Elfreda, I must away without saying goodbye.
 I am sure you cannot understand, but please trust in me.
 Don this immediately.
 ‚ÄîJ.
 I tugged at the tie and the string fell away.

Velixar let his hand slowly lower until his fingertips hovered before Harruq‚Äôs forehead.
 ‚ÄúThen I ask you this: will you devote your life to the protection of his?
 Will you swear your life to me, as your brother has?
 I can guide you, teach you, and give you the power to protect him.
 Answer me.‚Äù
 Harruq looked once more at his brother and then let his head fall.
 ‚ÄúI swear my life to you.
 And to Qurrah.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI would have it no other way,‚Äù Velixar said.
 A hand touched his forehead.

Besides, I had given up surprise at anything he might do.
 So I hardly noted the changes in his obsessions and moods, until Christmas day.
 It was the second anniversary of losing my dad.
 After the family party at my Aunt Evangeline‚Äôs place, where my dad had eaten his final meal, I drove to pick up Eric.
 He wanted to go to Sunset Cliffs, near Fort Rosecrans where his dad was buried.
 His dad, Carl Curtis, was an Army Air Force pilot who crashed during a test flight while Eric was still a baby.
 Sylvia blamed her sister Rosarie for the crash.
 Rosarie, she believed, wielded demonic powers.
 In twilight, Eric and I climbed up from the beach and explored some caves.
 After dark, we rested atop the cliff, in a little park a half mile from the Cabrillo lighthouse.

He chuckled.
 "Watch."
 He quickly loaded the dishwasher, poured in the soap, and turned it on.
 "The door is locked, and hot water will blast the dishes."
 She blinked.
 "How?"
 He laughed.
 "I have no idea."
 After listening to the water in the machine for a few moments, she turned to Rick with a shy smile.
 "Can we watch a picture?"

In the First World War, there were 20 military casualties for each civilian death.
 In the Second World War, the ratio was one to one.
 In the Korean War, civilian deaths out numbered military losses five to one.
 In the Vietnam War, this ratio rose to 20 to one.
 Advances in the sophistication and dissemination of modern military technology have fuelled this trend.
 The Iran‚ÄìIraq War, the war in Afghanistan and the Gulf War involved the use of ballistic missiles against civilian centres.
 In all, over 5,000 surface-to-surface missiles have targeted population centres during the last five decades.
 The devastating effect of even conventional weapons on economic activity and society in general is so great that today no developed nation can afford the costs of military confrontation, either at home or overseas.
 No longer can non-combatants sit quietly on the sidelines or work productively undisturbed.
 War both between and within states has come to involve and affect all of society.

 She stared at the garage door as it slowly rose.

 she asked when he got in without doing so.
 "No."

I hardly even blushed at the inevitable giggles.
 I made a mental note to find out from Britney if I'd caught his question on the second or third repetition, but I rather suspected I'd forget.
 In fact, when class finally got out I remembered my question, but just didn't feel like asking.
 Instead, I just wanted to get away from her and the never-ending gossip.
 I waited until she stopped to talk to one of the cheerleaders about who was dating who, and then mumbled something about the bathroom, and made a break for it.
 Not wanting to out-and-out lie, I ducked into the nearest restroom.
 It was empty except for a mousy brunette I'd only seen a couple of times before.
 I smiled and started to open my mouth to say hi, but thought better of it.
 This was Sanctuary.
 She wasn't going to acknowledge the new girl was even breathing, let alone sentient.

I followed his gaze to find his opponent, and then dove.
 I hadn‚Äôt put much planning in this, but I was still running on adrenaline.
 I decided the fastest course of action was pecking his eyes out.
 It worked.
 He threw his hands up, covering his face, screaming.
 But he did not attack me.
 As I rose back to find my next target, I saw the wolves.
 They were also not being attacked, fighting with no opposition.
 And then I remembered what Chevelle had said.
 They would not kill the animals.

A soft wind blew, making the fire dance, and in the flickering flames Velixar smiled.
 ‚ÄúI was the favorite of Karak, my dear orcish friend.
 He gave me life when other men would have long turned to dust.
 When he was defeated, and his servants were cast into the abyss, I alone escaped punishment.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI am not orcish,‚Äù Qurrah said, harsher than he meant.
 Velixar raised his hand in a small gesture of apology.
 ‚ÄúOrcish blood is in your veins, but perhaps I am mistaken.
 What are you then?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI am a half-orc,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 His shoulders hunched, and his head lowered as a reluctant bit of shame stung his words.

I hesitated, slowly making my way down.
 A bridge might mean a village was nearby, and a village meant elves.
 I didn‚Äôt want to get caught, not after all this, so I was fully prepared to run by the time I reached the crossing.
 Its stacked gray stones were bulkier than those that had been appearing more frequently on my path.
 Water flowed beneath, smoothing the stones at the base.
 They were so worn, it must have been in place for centuries.
 The leather soles of my shoes skimmed over ancient stone, the bridge curving gently before flattening out into a worn dirt path on the other side.
 It was more traveled than I would have liked, so I swung wide, through the trees instead.
 The wind shifted and the scent of roasting meat assaulted me, dragging my attention, my feet, its way.
 Despite my concerns about other elves, my stomach tightened, my mouth watering as I followed it through the trees.

He also had a chance to examine his own plumbing, and was pleased with the results; his new body was large and powerfully built even in places that most people would not see.
 The only thing of use in the water closet was a shaving kit which Rodregas added to the trunk.
 Next he went to the study door only to find it locked.
 He looked for a key but there was nothing.
 He guessed that it was locked by magic and required a magic word or incantation to open the lock.
 He pushed and pulled on the door, but it was solidly made and there was nothing to get a good hold of to test his new strength.
 He looked around for something to use as a pry bar; next to the fireplace was a poker.
 He grabbed it and forced it into the crack were a normal door would have its catch.
 He got it wedged in good but then stopped and went over to the outside door and opening it, listened for anyone nearby before going back inside the room.
 He carefully closed the door behind him; the sound of him breaking down the study door would ring loud in the predawn silence, but his need for money was too great.

‚ÄúTo the Order and to the Celestials!‚Äù This time the Grand Marshal seemed to look around at all the spectators until finally he nodded, satisfied.
 Without another word he strode out.
 Imeralda followed him as did all the squire‚Äôs attendants.
 It was time for the final match.
 Rodregas left his shield and mace relaxed at his side and strode over to Nordien, who stood with shield and mace at the ready.
 Instead of attacking he asked the big man, ‚ÄúSo, are people right, do you plan to serve the Immortalists if you gain the greater sigil?‚Äù The squire looked around a little confused.
 He was clearly not expecting a conversation, but no one was near enough to hear.
 ‚ÄúThe Immortalists are the true power of the realm.
 To tie ones self to them is only smart,‚Äù Nordien responded.
 ‚ÄúSo, you do not deny it,‚Äù said Rodregas.

Sometimes Dino would stand in the backyard and direct us with a garden hose nozzle, spraying us from one chore to the next.
 Dino was sick.
 We never knew when we were going to get knocked across the room.
 We were often treated like unwanted animals.
 We wondered why this was happening to us but at the same time we wondered if the same thing was happening in the families across the street.
 Our half-brother, Harry (named after Dino‚Äôs father) was soon born.
 Then, my stepfather had even less regard for us as we were now second-class citizens to his ‚Äúreal‚Äù son.
 My mother was also abused.
 She stayed, as so many abused women do, because her only options would only lead us back to poverty and uncertainty, and also because Dino threatened to take my little brother to Greece where she would never see him again.
 She protected us and herself as best as she could and she likely hoped for better days.

Obviously, she could feel that same power Rodregas had.
 That was interesting.
 She then ran her hand from one to the next until she had touched all twelve books.
 Then, she looked up and her expression reminded Rodregas of some girl who had gotten the perfect mid winter gift that she had been dreaming of.
 ‚ÄúThese are not books on magic,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúThese are Grimoires, several of them of great power.‚Äù ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚ÄúI was a squire who learned a little magic, but I really can‚Äôt say that I know the difference between a book of magic and a Grimoire.‚Äù Imeralda looked surprised and said, ‚ÄúOh, you guys must depend on the oral tradition.
 That is a hard way to learn.
 The symbols and geometric figures that form a powerful spell are often too complex to learn from just the spoken word.‚Äù Rodregas cut in and clarified, ‚ÄúI mean, in the order we did read books on magic theory and history, but I never felt energy from them before.‚Äù Imeralda nodded, ‚ÄúLet me explain.
 First, you have a lot more power now, and power calls to power.
 So, you are a lot more sensitive to the power that the books have.

Liz ‚Äì Thanks Mr. Trelain, Jim was just telling me what he thought.
 I would appreciate hearing your opinion on what you like and dislike.
 Art ‚Äì Well, I must say I love that painting of Jesus and Elvis shaking hands, and the one next to it of them fighting the Ninjas.
 It looks so lifelike, and it is extremely unique in concept.
 For the rest, I‚Äôm not art-minded enough to tell you anything special.
 Liz ‚Äì That doesn‚Äôt matter, just tell me what appeals to you.
 Art ‚Äì I haven‚Äôt seen it all yet.
 The other piece that really sticks out in my mind is that one about Gene.
 Wonderful imagery, and you got his hair perfect.
 Maybe I can give you more after I get a better look at it all.

Encourage their girlfriend or wife to sell her body.
 Anything to get the cash they desperately need to feed the demon that owns them.
 The most extreme way to increase Oxy‚Äôs effect is to reduce the powder to a liquid, draw it into a syringe, and shoot it into their veins, warming them from the inside out.
 Sound familiar?
 There is nothing more glamorous about this drug than heroin.
 The same addiction, the same diseases, the same low-down disgusting lying homeless in the alley and piss your pants drug‚ÄîOxy is essentially synthetic heroin.
 And the last step, when addicts can no longer afford Oxy, is to get on heroin.
 Lives are ruined or lost completely to this drug, which, unlike the drugs of the past, is found in the medicine cabinets of parents, grandparents and patients with severe pain all over this world.
 Some of these patients lose their prescription unsuspectingly to family members or caregivers who steal it for the street value.
 Other patients have discovered the street value so they beg their medical providers for more, claiming their pain has escalated and they need it more frequently to stop their suffering; then, they sell it.

 touch me .
 .
 .
 in ways that were inappropriate, because whenever you kiss and touch me, all I can think about is how exquisite it feels and how I want more.
 I think-I think you're right: I think that you could have touched me any way you wanted, and all I would have done would have been catch my breath and beg for more."
 She rubbed her face against his arm.
 "So if I was supposed to stop you, and you knew I wouldn't, why did you stop?"
 "Because you looked into my eyes and told me you love me."
 He sighed.

For the most part it was worth it.
 Especially when the news story broke that officer Roberts spent an entire week diligently patrolling the area while keeping an eye out for Martians who are in the country illegally.
 But no matter, I won‚Äôt be going to them anyway.
 Johnny ‚Äì Then what are you going to do?
 Eugene ‚Äì I‚Äôm going to move on with my life, hopefully.
 And keep the promise I made to Art.
 Johnny ‚Äì And what did you promise our father?
 Eugene ‚Äì That I would stay out of trouble.

 Johnny ‚Äì Five dollars says that he‚Äôs arrested by the end of next week.

Ruby walked in and I snapped the book shut, positive I shouldn‚Äôt have taken it from her table without permission.
 One glance at her stifled reaction and I knew I‚Äôd not be able to ask her about what I‚Äôd read.
 ‚ÄúSleep well?‚Äù she asked.
 ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I started, my voice hoarse.
 She handed me a glass of water, which she smoothly traded for the book.
 ‚ÄúDreams,‚Äù I complained.
 She smiled as she sat on the bed beside me.
 ‚ÄúSome seek out the breath.
 They say it is foresight.‚Äù ‚ÄúForesight?‚Äù She nodded.
 ‚ÄúWhat did you see?‚Äù She raised an eyebrow questioningly.

CM:  	So, between Turntable Poison and your California period, lies a great gulf that not a whole lot of people know about.
 I think we should try to understand what led you to this change, a real sea change in the eyes of the public.
 Can you talk a bit about that time?
 BG:  	First, as we‚Äôve discussed, I don‚Äôt see that big a change between Memphis and L.A.
 I mean, geographically, yes, Big City vs. hometown, sure.
 But, as for my art, there‚Äôs a direct line from Turntable Poison to Rain and Other Distractions.
 There‚Äôs a road if you wanna delineate it.
 CM: 	Really?
 That‚Äôs what I want to hear about.
 Not just the line between the works but what was going on in your life.

In my usual humorous deflection of discomfort, I quip that the last time I met Ashley it was a ‚Äúhappy ending‚Äù and I would like the same result this time.
 The officers are un-amused.
 The officers are sent to stake out a nearby drugstore.
 My story to the drug dealers will be that I will fill the prescription there and meet her in that parking lot as it is a stone‚Äôs throw within the county line which they want the bust in.
 One problem I point out is that the drugstore will be closed in a few minutes but they send the crew that direction for feedback on the location.
 The call comes back and the parking lot is virtually empty of cars leaving no cover for the officers to hide.
 I am starting to feel like I know more about this drug busting business than the cops.
 After a change of venue to a nearby grocery store down the street and several miles within the county line, it is nearly 9 pm and I have been unable to call my wife for over three hours.
 The officers move into place for the bust.
 Several marked police cars hide in an adjacent apartment complex that has a driveway into the grocery store parking lot at the opposite end of the shopping center.

She thanked one staff member after another and one student after another, each for something specific they had contributed to her healing.
 She said she now felt worthwhile, beautiful and confident.
 She had learned how to manage the demons in her head.
 She was beautiful and it shocked me that she had ever considered anything else and to the point that she tried to destroy herself.
 I couldn‚Äôt help but compare her in my mind to Ashley.
 A young man was next.
 He spoke with a Jersey tough guy accent, was animated as he addressed the room, and his posture was that of some hoodlum walking the streets.
 He wore a sleeveless white tank top (a wife beater) revealing tattoos covering both his arms and wrapping all the way up around his neck.
 It seemed like an unusual choice of clothing given the ceremony and the fact that our son had requested that we bring him a suit, but we were looking across such a diverse room that it actually did fit.
 He was warm and friendly and although his appearance shocked me at first, just as our first impression of this facility had, he too won me over.

"So did I."
 Rick opened her car door.
 "If you were into racquetball, I'd invite you out for a couple of games tomorrow.
 How about tennis--do you like tennis?"
 "Afraid not.
 I'm not much of an athlete."
 "How about brunch and a movie then?"
 "That sounds great."
 Rick felt good about the evening and was looking forward to seeing Sharon again the next day.
 The only down side was the report that Ted would expect Monday morning.

The only noise Qurrah heard was the sound of skin blistering and popping in the fire.
 At last the man crumpled, the bloodied shard of glass from the bottle still in his hand.
 ‚ÄúDamn it,‚Äù Qurrah said, wincing as he touched the cut on his back.
 It was wide but not deep.
 Painful too, he noticed as he took a few steps.
 Furious, he turned back to the corpse of the drunken man and smashed a fist against its chest.
 The body shriveled into dust, only the bones remaining.
 ‚ÄúHalt!‚Äù shouted a voice from far down the street.
 Qurrah glimpsed an elf carrying a bow.
 Just one, the half-orc noticed, but that would quickly change.

Karen ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt know that Johnny was so sentimental.
 Art ‚Äì He isn‚Äôt, he just likes the food.
 The boy would crash a wake if the food were good.
 Jim ‚Äì He actually wanted to do that once.
 Art ‚Äì He didn‚Äôt do it did he?
 Jim ‚Äì Nah, Liz and I talked him out of it.
 Art ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt think reasoning with the boy would work.
 Jim ‚Äì It didn‚Äôt.
 Karen ‚Äì What did you say then?
 Jim ‚Äì That crashing a wake for the food was something that Gene would do.

He went to the right and slammed his remaining sword into the Orqui.
 The slaver grunted with pain and surprise at his quick change of targets.
 Rodregas‚Äô short sword caught him in the shoulder.
 The guard half fell and half stumbled away to safety.
 Rodregas turned to the final slaver and saw fear in his eyes.
 Then Rodregas looked around and saw that he was no longer facing just one remaining opponent, but now faced four including another Immortal Guard and three more slavers.
 He had hoped they could pick off enough with the Black Yew bows to keep odds like this against them.
 Rodregas glanced to the ground hoping to see the previous guard‚Äôs blue steel long sword.
 It would do a lot to give him at least a chance against these odds, but it was nowhere to be seen.
 The dead guard‚Äôs small shield, though, was near his feet.

"Almost?"
 He stopped, turning to face her.
 They were in the dappled shadows of early blossoms, and he drew her into his arms to kiss her gently.
 Marie's heart pounded as she kissed him back.
 His kisses were rare, so she savored each one, clinging to him and hoping that it would go on forever.
 But he ended this one all too soon, raising his head to gaze down into her sparkling eyes.
 "I love you," he whispered, pressing his lips to her forehead.
 Those words were even rarer than his kisses; she'd heard them only twice before.
 "I love you too, Davis."
 Caught up in the evening's enchantment, she gazed up into his eyes, hoping he'd kiss her again.

His words filled her with anguish.
 She could have him, but only if she stayed here.
 And she couldn't do that.
 She had to go home.
 To have Rick, she would have to give up her parents, her friends, her home.
 She loved Rick with her whole heart, but how could she .
 .
 .
 how could she give up everything she'd ever known?
 Rick handed Marie his handkerchief.

What he had felt was simply disgusting.
 Why would a book, no matter what its contents, have such a feel to it?
 He walked back to the book and got down on the ground.
 Without actually touching it, Rodregas slowly ran his fingertips along the binder of the book.
 While the feeling was not as strong as when he had held it, clearly the feeling of what could only be described as evil emanated from the book.
 Was this feeling truly coming from the book or was this some new ability of his new body to sense the nature of the book‚Äôs contents?
 Rodregas got up and walked over to the bookshelf.
 He closed his eyes and, trying not to touch, lightly ran his hands close to the row of books.
 Quickly he realized that with some books he felt nothing.
 Other books seemed to buzz with energy but gave off no bad feelings.

‚ÄúHis mother died, too.
 We killed her.‚Äù It sounded so matter-of-fact, my head bobbing along with the words.
 I couldn‚Äôt seem to stop.
 My mouth opened to speak once more but I was suddenly swept up, off Steed‚Äôs lap and into Chevelle‚Äôs arms.
 I managed fear for half a second but then lost the feeling to dizziness, followed quickly by only dull numbness.
 Chevelle was laying me on my bed.
 ‚ÄúStay here.
 It will pass.‚Äù His words were gentle now, the anger gone.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I whispered.
 He didn‚Äôt respond.

As I entered, Sylvia's fierce green eyes taunted me.
 She demanded, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the purpose of life?‚Äù ‚ÄúGive me a minute,‚Äù I said.
 ‚ÄúTo know love and serve God,‚Äù she declared, with a hiss on "serve."
 Later she would tell me she got that answer from a priest in an orphanage where, as a teenager terrified of her own sister, she had gone to seek refuge.
 Sylvia‚Äôs challenge sent me to 1 John 4:8.
 "Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love."
 I needed to know more about love.
 I was single after seventeen years married.
 My two kids, both in their teens, were awfully troubled.
 And God seemed too far away.

‚ÄúIt will help with the healing.‚Äù Why bother?
 I wondered.
 It would be another day of bombardment with mountain fixtures‚Ä¶ maybe whole trees this time.
 My face pinched with annoyance and Chevelle threw me a piece of dried meat, barely holding back a smile as he jumped on his horse.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better get started,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to be a long walk.‚Äù As he kicked his heels, I spun toward the corner where my horse had been.
 He was galloping up the mountain now, just over a hundred yards away.
 I tried to think quickly, to keep the anger from slowing my response.
 Using magic to pull Chevelle‚Äôs horse by the tail, I ran after him, hoping to leap on.
 A tree branch came from nowhere and smacked me flat across the face.
 Chevelle‚Äôs horse whinnied as they rode away.

When she was done, he took her to a jewelry store, thinking she might like that, but there was jewelry in 1927.
 She was much more interested in the electronic gadgets next door, and she spent ten minutes exclaiming over the effects of a blacklight.
 When he bought her one, her face came alive with delight.
 "It'll make your rug glow!"
 "Just what I always wanted: fluorescent purple carpet."
 But he grinned as he took the bag from the cashier.
 "Thank you so much, Rick," she said, beaming up at him.
 "I think you're more excited about the blacklight than the clothes."
 "I love the clothes--they're beautiful.
 But the light .

Not even the bond of Ja'tell provides you with that right."
 Brandon's grin was wider even than before.
 "Ah, but those aren't the laws under which we labor now, are they?
 She's mine, and I have every right to do whatever I wish to her.
 Her presence among your pack is a direct affront to my rights and honor.
 I could demand your life, be glad I'm only requiring two of your pack."
 Alec shook his head, face more emotionless than even a second before.
 "By the same laws set down by Adjam and Inock when they first took mates from among the dayborn, I challenge your bond of Ja'tell.
 I challenge your standing among the people, and your personal honor.
 The dispute between us is such as can only be settled by blood."

We fought like all brothers did, but we had always shared a bedroom and we talked each other to sleep every night.
 I never remember my mother dating much, so I think she was careful not to introduce us to any suitor until it was more serious.
 She eventually met a man who she was serious about, Dino.
 He would sometimes bring food we were not accustomed to eating, like steak.
 I had no memory of any man ever giving us a gift or anything of the sort before, but occasionally he would bring us a trinket to our mother‚Äôs delight.
 He was a big man with a dark complexion and jet-black hair and he would often talk on the phone in his native Greek.
 Thomas and I had never heard someone speak in a foreign language so it was intriguing.
 My mom soon married Dino and we officially had a stepfather.
 Shortly after they were married we moved north to Sacramento.
 It was a six-hour drive from where my grandparents and uncle lived.

Somewhere in the recesses of his soul, though, a glimmer of compassion flashed forth; if only because of what awaited the prisoner.
 On the other hand, knowing what was to befall the female prisoner mounting the stairs behind him thrust Rodregas deeper into a foul mood.
 Her long auburn hair fell in waves about her shoulders, and her startling green eyes were almost too large for her angular face.
 Her skin was the golden hue of the High AElves, the most magically powerful of all the Ijosalfar people.
 Although her auburn hair and her slim athletic build marked her as a half-breed, a woman such as she drew many an appreciative stare.
 She was not beautiful in a way that Rodregas was used to, yet the odd combination of her features captivated Rodregas.
 She was young and her innate abilities in the magical arts were thought to be immense.
 At the moment the possibility that she would ever achieve such power diminished with each step nearer the tower roof.
 Her eyes were alert, and she gazed around her for an opportunity to escape.
 The gag on her mouth and the iron bands on her arms prevented her from calling on her magic to help her.

"Will you put some on my back?"
 She stretched out on her stomach.
 He ran his hands up and down and around her back, massaging and caressing.
 Her skin was so soft.
 He dropped a kiss onto her shoulder.
 "Does that feel good?"
 "Mmm," she murmured sleepily.
 Moving her hair aside, he kissed the nape of her neck.
 Then he moved down, slowly pressing kisses along the length of her spine.
 Marie's toes curled, her body on fire.

"Mom, I'll be fine.
 Just think of it as an extended hike.
 You'll even have cell phone coverage, so you can check in with me as often as you want."
 At least I hoped we'd be able to arrange that somehow.
 "As for the brochure, you've got scads of great shots already.
 Maybe if you call up Mr. Peters you'll be able to work something out."
 Actually I was positive Mr. Peters would be amiable to the idea.
 At least he would be if Alec had remembered to work whatever magic he'd used on the Mayor the first time.
 Of course it was possible he'd forgotten to make the arrangements, but somehow I doubted it.
 Mom looked like she was starting to waver.

 Rick nuzzled her temple.
 "But now that you're not going to marry Davis, will you at least stop feeling guilty when we kiss?"
 She smiled.
 "I like your kisses."
 "I like yours too."
 He pressed his lips to hers.
 Marie nestled close to him, hoping he'd kiss her like he had last time.
 But then she hiccupped.
 Rick, startled, pulled back.

Sylvia was an invalid, and rather crazy, given to dark moods and paranoid notions.
 She was the mother of my best friend Eric.
 I had come to help with chores and listen to her rant about whatever injustices she had recently suffered.
 Her apartment was dingy and cluttered, mostly with books.
 Eric‚Äôs high school senior-class picture, blown up to poster size and framed, hung facing the entry door.
 As I entered, Sylvia's fierce green eyes taunted me.
 She demanded, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the purpose of life?‚Äù ‚ÄúGive me a minute,‚Äù I said.
 ‚ÄúTo know love and serve God,‚Äù she declared, with a hiss on "serve."

They could be especially effective in lowland tropics, including much of Africa.
 Potato yields in Belgium and the Netherlands are roughly three times the world average.
 This productivity gap between what is routinely achieved by different countries represents a vast immediate potential for improving yields that does not require significant additional investment of time or money in R & D. The world already possesses the knowledge, technology and organizational capacities to raise considerably average world yields in major crops.
 Emphasizing cultivation practices
 The phenomenal increases in productivity achieved over the past three decades through the development of improved and hybrid varieties of seeds have over shadowed and distracted attention from the equally great potential of raising yields through improvements in methods of cultivation.
 This is especially true since much of the slowdown in productivity growth is attributable to depletion of soil and water resources, which can be partially rectified or offset by improved practices.
 Growing environmental concerns in the West have generated pressure for reducing fertilizer consumption in developing countries, when in most instances fertilizer application levels are lower than those in Western Europe by a factor of five or ten times.
 Increased, rather than reduced, use of chemical fertilizers will be essential to the expansion of agriculture in these countries and can considerably increase crop yields.
 Total fertilizer consumption by developing countries is expected to double by 2010.
 Furthermore, replacing macro-nutrients lost during intensive cultivation does not compensate for the depletion of more than a dozen micro-nutrients that also determine the quantity and quality of crops.

He sat down, drawing her into his arms.
 His embrace made her feel secure enough to swallow her fear.
 When her breathing had returned to normal, she pulled back to look into his eyes.
 "I want to go home."
 "OK."  He stroked her hair.
 "Why don't you close your eyes and just think about home?
 I won't touch you or say a word."
 "All right."
 She closed her eyes and began thinking about Davis and how it felt to dance with him.
 She thought about her mother and father and brother and how they'd laughed and talked at meals before her brother had been disowned.

What did she say?‚Äù ‚ÄúShe hinted that she knew who made us this way and who attacked us that day,‚Äù I said.
 ‚ÄúShe also said that Kojas would use our emotions against us and try to get us to come to him.‚Äù Something dark crossed Seth's face.
 ‚ÄúShe also said that we were chosen because of our strong bond, but she said, not to test it,‚Äù I continued.
 ‚ÄúShe also told me not to go into the shadows.‚Äù Seth stretched.
 ‚ÄúSo the usual confusion?‚Äù ‚ÄúI got more this time, Seth.
 Anyway, do you have any information to offer here?‚Äù I asked with an edge to my voice.
 Seth put his arms in surrender.
 ‚ÄúHey, don't start yelling at me.
 We were getting a long pretty well last night, let's keep it that way.‚Äù I felt my face flush when I remembered last night.
 ‚ÄúYes, you're right.‚Äù I was eager to change the subject so I said, ‚ÄúAre you going to tell them when they wake up?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes I will, Jazell.

‚ÄúYes master?‚Äù he asked.
 No weakness tainted his voice.
 The man in black put a hand on either side of Qurrah‚Äôs face and drew him close.
 ‚ÄúBecome a god among men,‚Äù he whispered.
 ‚ÄúRemain faithful to me, and to Karak, and I shall see it come to pass.‚Äù
 Qurrah nodded but said nothing.
 Instead, he turned and joined his brother.
 ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go home,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking that‚Äôs a great idea,‚Äù Harruq said.
 The two stepped around the bodies of the slain as they headed east, leaving Velixar alone in the emptiness of Cornrows.

She has a lot of love to give.
 Do not be so selfish as to want it all to yourself.‚Äù With that he gave a punch to Rodregas‚Äô side, causing Rodregas to grunt in pain, and Doi‚Äôvan followed the other two out the door.
 Rodregas laid in the bed, his mind whirling with thoughts.
 At first he thought about the implications of what Jordaan had shared.
 But, then his mind went back again and again over his and Imeralda‚Äôs time during the last few weeks and then back to Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs words.
 He knew his friend spoke the truth, but he was not so sure about his ability to do what he needed to keep his relationship with the beautiful AElven Nymph.
 CHAPTER 11 THE NATURE OF BONDS
 The next few days Rodregas and Doi‚Äôvan recovered quickly under the powerful healing magic of Jordaan.
 This is not to say Rodregas did not spend most of his time dreaming that the handsome young Nymph would head back to his own estates.
 They were staying in a small village that seemed to be mostly a forest with small rooms built into it.

You know, you don‚Äôt go out on stage and say, I‚Äôm gonna make their guitarist look silly.
 There‚Äôs a lot more fellow-feeling among musicians.
 So, Christ, what was my point?
 We were playing these gigs, getting bigger, getting a rep.
 This was the end of the sixties.
 There was talk of a concert in upstate New York that was gonna blow everybody away.
 And we had just signed on with Pete Holder, who was both lawyer and agent.
 Well, Pete said, he thought he could get us in on this New York concert.
 He was talking to Bill Graham, who was bringing in some new acts, one of which, I remember was Cocker, who nobody knew.
 And Graham was kind of holding the proceedings hostage, making demands, etc.

Aurelia cast a spell over her ears, heightening her already sharp hearing.
 A pall settled over her as she listened.
 ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äåmust resume,‚Äù Qurrah was saying as her spell enacted.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs dangerous,‚Äù Harruq said.
 ‚ÄúI thought you were learning enough from Velixar.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù said Qurrah.
 ‚ÄúBut I must practice what I learn.
 These nights are not enough, will never be enough.
 What point is sharpening your sword if you never wield it?‚Äù
 Harruq had no reply.

And then a delicate hand reached out to pass Chevelle a package.
 Her fingers lingered against his during the exchange and my chest felt like it was blistering inside.
 They were whispering about me.
 My watcher.
 This woman.
 Chevelle‚Äôs gaze brushed mine once more and I hungered to hear what they were saying.
 I was fixated on it, my mind spinning, convinced that if I were as invisible as everyone thought, if they truly couldn‚Äôt see me, at least I could get closer and finally know.
 As I shook my head at the idea, my eyes fell downward.
 A small scream escaped.
 My arms were covered in tree bark, blending seamlessly with the stump on which I sat.

"Why don't you want to kiss me any more?"
 "I want to--I just can't.
 Let me cool off a minute."
 "I don't want to cool off."
 On the contrary--she wanted more of the kisses and caresses that had set her on fire.
 But when she tried to put her arms around him, he held her away.
 Hurt, she stood up and whirled around to go to her room.
 "Marie, wait.
 Please.
 Sit down and let's talk about this."

Surrounded by fire and death, the half-orc stripped naked of his rags and donned the robes of his former master.
 Despite all the arrows and heat, they seemed in perfect condition.
 Even the stain of blood was already fading.
 Qurrah held the side of the hood to his mouth and coughed as the smoke grew ever thicker.
 ‚ÄúGoodbye, Velixar,‚Äù he said.
 Then he chose a direction and staggered away.
 Slowly, and with a few wide curves through the carnage, he found a way out.
 He huddled the black robes tighter about his thin body, relishing the soft feel and perfect fit.
 Smoke clogged his lungs, but the stinking waves of it were lessening the farther he walked.
 ‚ÄúWhere are you, brother?‚Äù Qurrah asked once he could breathe freely.

He felt an unseen hand grab his chest, and then they were running blind.
 The minutes crawled, their frantic breathing the only audible sound.
 Qurrah lagged further and further behind, unable to keep the pace.
 Harruq tightened his grip on his wrist and pulled him along.
 The terrain sloped beneath them as they climbed a hill.
 Another quick shift and they were stumbling down that same hill.
 The cold hand vanished.
 The cloud dissipated.
 Before him, standing with his arms crossed, waited Velixar.
 Qurrah stunned his brother by falling to one knee and bowing his head.

"I can't promise he'll even read it."
 It was a he who'd intervened on our behalf, and Rachel and Alec's father had died years ago, while Brandon's father...actually I knew next to nothing about Brandon's parents.
 I wasn't even sure whether or not they were around.
 They must be though--if it had been a male who'd saved us, then it couldn't be the Graveses, and that left only Brandon's family.
 It was hard to believe that Brandon had stepped in and done so much for us, but the pieces fit together so tightly.
 Brandon was even more wonderful and amazing than I'd thought before.
 Part of me expected this new revelation to keep my mind whirling so fast that it would take me hours to go to sleep.
 I was only partly right.
 It took quite a while for me to go to sleep, but this time the culprit was the light outside my window.

It is true that the UN stands for diversity and pluralism, but not when it comes to freedom and human rights.
 True pluralism and diversity can only be exercised and enjoyed by people in freedom.
 Recognizing the considerable effort that will be needed to prepare still subject people and to train national leaders in democratic institutions and processes, all possible support should be extended by the international community to make available the knowledge and skills needed to build viable political institutions.
 The UN should establish a graded, time-bound programme for the transformation of authoritarian states.
 Should the people of any country themselves prefer an alternative system, let them freely make that choice by electoral process.
 Suspension of voting rights or of the privileges of membership should be the ultimate penalty for the failure of governments to comply with this condition within a reasonable period of time.
 The affirmation of democratic principles cannot and will not stop with the domestic governance of member countries.
 It is inevitable that the same principles be extended to the relationships between the nations that make up the international community.
 The present structure of the UN system is a product of the Second World War, just as the League of Nations was of the First.
 The Allied powers conceived it at the height of the war and evolved its structure to reflect the immediate post-war realities.

Behind it the haze thinned just enough I could see the outline of mountains.
 The image was like a punch in the chest.
 Chevelle rode up beside us.
 ‚ÄúThe hills of Camber.‚Äù I looked at him, my watcher, and thought his features were peaceful for the first time.
 Junnie had said he was from the North, and I wondered if this was his home.
 Maybe that was why he‚Äôd truly brought me here, a much-needed vacation from the duties of council, the task of being a watcher.
 They‚Äôd never know, as long as he got me back soon.
 When we reached the lake, the horses stopped and in the quiet shadow of this dreamlike encounter, I forgot I was riding.
 The mountains and lake were almost too much to take in; none of it seemed real.
 This time, Chevelle was next to me before Steed had the chance.

I mustered a half-hearted grin and followed Britney out into the hall.
 "She's a complete monster.
 None of the other teachers are nearly as strict as Campbell.
 Making you catch up on all that homework is ridiculous."
 My silence seemed to leave my new friend at a loss for words.
 I guess she was used to people agreeing with everything she said.
 I didn't like to lie though, so when I didn't agree with someone I tended not to say anything.
 I guess I didn't think my new task was as unreasonable as it'd first appeared?

Spinning into a tumble to keep from landing flat on my face, I rolled to my feet, still thrilling from the fire play.
 From magic.
 I let out a breathless laugh and Chevelle joined in, though in all fairness, he might have merely been amused by my fall.
 We spent the next several hours there in the meadow, sculpting my craft.
 The exercises grew increasingly more difficult, but it seemed Chevelle was only toying with me.
 He must have had experience with fire magic; the flames he produced behaved like an obedient dog.
 Mine, on the other hand, were about as compliant as a wet cat.
 Exhausted by the day‚Äôs work, I began to sway a bit.
 Chevelle led me to the base of an old willow tree and I slumped against the trunk, sliding down to lie on my back.
 Chevelle reclined against the tree, his legs coming to rest just above my head in the soft grass.

Most teachers would still offer some kind of extra credit if you begged hard enough.
 I spent the next hour mapping out exactly how I was going to salvage my college prospects, and had more or less pulled myself together by the time English ended.
 My newfound dedication to excellence meant I outdid myself in Algebra.
 I finished up the day's homework, and made it more than halfway through one of my makeup assignments by the time Mrs. Campbell stopped off at my desk.
 "Care to run another errand for me, Adriana?"
 I didn't really want to.
 Not when I'd just discovered I had more studying to do than was humanly possible.
 Still, Mrs. Campbell had always been super nice, if equally stern, and there was only ten more minutes of class left.
 Besides, I'd been so intrigued by the sight of Alec drawing that I wanted to see him like that again.
 If he could take such joy in the creation process, maybe he wasn't as bad as he seemed.

History was about as dry as I'd expected, which was really too bad.
 I'd had a good history teacher in junior high, and it was an incredibly interesting subject when taught right.
 Unfortunately Mr. Simms was possibly the worst teacher I'd ever had.
 I mentally shrugged when we were told to open our books and read the chapter to ourselves.
 At least I wouldn't have any worries when it came to catching up in this class.
 Thoughts of Brandon made it hard to really get into the chapter.
 Also, it was hard not to notice the borderline hostile stares from the other kids.
 I sighed in relief when the bell rang, and pulled out my schedule and map to see where I'd be going next.
 Physics?
 I mentally reviewed my conversation with the secretary, but couldn't remember either of us mentioning the class.

My room was still miserable, but with Mom sitting down in the living room with her laptop going through the gigs of data that she'd shot over the last few days, it offered the only real chance at some time alone.
 I trudged up the stairs, shut my door, and then realized I wasn't sure what to do with myself.
 I'd spent most of the time since we'd arrived either buried in homework, or borderline catatonic.
 The obvious choice was sitting on the rickety table next to my bed, but I wasn't sure if I was up to Les Mis√©rables right now.
 Maybe in a few weeks, once the production had left Vegas, I'd be ready to delve back into it.
 Right now it was just another reminder of how many things in my life I didn't have control over.
 No, that was right out.
 I thumbed through Pride and Prejudice for a few minutes, and then just gave up and headed to the bathroom.
 A short time later, teeth brushed and face washed, I swung my window wide open and climbed into bed.
 It would take hours for the air to cool down enough to start leeching some of the heat out of my room, but it was better than nothing.

Whatever the truth, she wounded my already tenderized feelings.
 For a while during the after-prom at a bowling alley, I left her and found Margaret.
 We hid under a pool table and talked about Eric and our dubious futures.
 Karen didn't care to join us for yet another party at Black's Beach, a place only accessible by a trail down a high sea cliff, where police never showed to bust rowdy kids for drinking.
 So around dawn, I rode shotgun while Cliff drove and Lucas Field and Carol Stuhr napped in back.
 We were on Murphy Canyon Road, a two-lane without sidewalks or curbs, bordered by vacant, hilly land.
 I dosed off.
 Then Cliff joined the rest of us.
 The parked station wagon we rammed might've saved our lives, as it kept the convertible from running up the side of a bank and flipping onto our heads.
 The station wagon was wrecked, Bob's Ford was totaled, and the four of us got cited on account of the case of beer in the trunk, which was meant for the beach party.

I felt slightly comforted either way.
 Once we were on our way, I didn‚Äôt mind so much.
 I was enjoying being back in the rhythm of the ride, not to mention the break from training.
 Conversation flowed easily as we made our way farther up the mountain.
 I had been thinking about my discussion with Steed, but hadn‚Äôt decided how to respond if I were asked again about the incident in the clearing, about controlling the snake.
 No one knew about the hawk and I wasn‚Äôt sure how I had done it to begin with, so I couldn‚Äôt exactly explain it.
 It would have been like explaining how to wiggle your ears to someone who wasn‚Äôt able.
 But it had been easy for me, much easier than fire even.
 I drew my cloak tighter around my shoulders and yawned as I considered my horse.
 I‚Äôd had so much trouble learning to control him, trying to push him from the outside.

I wanted to say something witty, but the thoughts all just swirled around in my head without making it down to my mouth.
 Brandon's smile grew just a little bigger.
 "I really think you should let me give you a ride home.
 Based on our past history, it's only a matter of time before one of us runs into the other, and I'm afraid of what my Mustang might do to you when that happens."
 Brandon's voice washed over me like silk, carrying away any desires I might have had to walk all the way home just to prove a point.
 Not trusting my voice, I nodded and took the couple of steps needed to reach his passenger door.
 "I wanted to apologize for what happened earlier today.
 Cassie can be a real jerk sometimes."
 It was too good to be true.
 I almost looked over at him, but I knew I'd lose myself in a pair of soft, gray eyes.

Dark had fallen.
 Hundreds of us lost souls crowded in front of the portable stage somewhere around the goal line.
 I suspected the others, like me, wanted to get near Billy Graham and his giant companions, for comfort and to borrow some of their power.
 The singing giant led a few thousand folks in a hymn.
 ‚ÄúSoftly and tenderly Jesus is calling, calling oh sinner come home, come home, come home, ye who are weary come home‚Ä¶‚Äù I mumbled the surrender words I heard someone else say, and waited.
 Cliff had stayed beside me.
 I believe he mumbled too.
 I looked for the girl with auburn hair, and wondered if she had bolted, too proud or afraid to surrender.
 Then a kid tapped me on the shoulder.
 I tapped Cliff and we followed the kid.

The air was still as he inclined his head toward Chevelle and then turned, a long, dark braid whipping behind him as he disappeared into the brush.
 This seemed to mean something to the group, something like relief.
 I stared after him, but Anvil stepped forward, thumping his balled fist against his chest in a gesture I didn‚Äôt understand.
 Grey followed, repeating the action and adding a single nod, and Ruby clasped her hands, bouncing excitedly from heel to toe.
 I felt myself drawing back together, tied by the knots in my stomach and mind.
 A tandem wolf howl sounded in the distance.
 My stomach swam in unease.
 Chapter Thirteen Diary
 The councilman‚Äôs body was disposed of, and the group bustled around the clearing.
 I slid my sword into its sheath, careful not to touch the blade.

Marie exclaimed breathlessly when she returned to Rick.
 "He danced with me!
 I danced with a movie star!"
 "I saw."
 He smiled, stroking a damp tendril of hair from her face.
 "Was it fun?"
 "It was incredible!
 I can't believe I danced with him!"
 "Come sit down for a minute and have a Coke."
 He managed to keep her still for less than five minutes.

He shook and I heard him do something that I thought Seth never did.
 He cried.
 I stepped out from behind the tree and walked over to him.
 He didn‚Äôt hear me, or look up.
 I wasn‚Äôt mad at him anymore for not telling me what I wanted to know.
 Now I felt bad that I had nagged him so hard that he was breaking.
 I walked over to him and wrapped my arms around his body.
 He stopped crying and I felt him squirm.
 Seth grunted and then mumbled, ‚ÄúGet off me.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, not until you tell me what‚Äôs going on,‚Äù I said.
 He groaned.

"No.

 "Do you want to run and get dressed before we eat?"
 "No.
 I want to know what the surprise is."
 He laughed.
 "You remembered that, did you?"
 He filled their glasses with Coke.
 "Well, I'll probably have to work late tomorrow too."
 She stared at him in dismay.

But I made the effort.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not entirely my fault,‚Äù I huffed.
 And then I was sorry I‚Äôd said anything.
 I didn‚Äôt need to defend myself to her.
 ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs still fun.‚Äù I wondered if she did know.
 Like everyone before.
 I pushed the thought from my head.
 ‚ÄúI thought the dogs were their weapons of choice,‚Äù I said, cringing a bit as I remembered their demonstration.
 ‚ÄúWolves, Frey.
 And they aren‚Äôt weapons.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt use them to attack?‚Äù She spoke like she was explaining to a child.

As a result, the ratio of military to civilian casualties in military conflicts changed dramatically.
 In the First World War, there were 20 military casualties for each civilian death.
 In the Second World War, the ratio was one to one.
 In the Korean War, civilian deaths out numbered military losses five to one.
 In the Vietnam War, this ratio rose to 20 to one.
 Advances in the sophistication and dissemination of modern military technology have fuelled this trend.
 The Iran‚ÄìIraq War, the war in Afghanistan and the Gulf War involved the use of ballistic missiles against civilian centres.
 In all, over 5,000 surface-to-surface missiles have targeted population centres during the last five decades.
 The devastating effect of even conventional weapons on economic activity and society in general is so great that today no developed nation can afford the costs of military confrontation, either at home or overseas.
 No longer can non-combatants sit quietly on the sidelines or work productively undisturbed.

She was in a party scene, one of six people that formed a group with the star.
 She wasn't supposed to do anything but smile and sip her drink, but when the star gave her a smoldering glance during rehearsal, the director decided he wanted to film it.
 The result was a split-second close-up of her face, and the star kissed her hand.
 Marie felt as if she were going to burst from excitement.
 They were allowed to watch filming until lunch, and then they were given a tour of the rest of the studio.
 Marie heard obscenities and shouting, and she saw two different actors storm off two different sets in the middle of their scenes.
 But it was wonderful.
 The actors and actresses were very attractive people, and many of them were nice to her.
 "Today was magic, absolute magic," Marie sighed as they ate steak and salad that evening.
 Rick smiled.

‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù The mood was perfect.
 I saw Seth relax a little and the look on his face was more like himself.
 I was perfectly happy with the way everything was right now until I saw the small outline of a toad dwarf nearby.
 ‚ÄúUh Seth I don't think this is the best time to mention this but I think we have company.‚Äù I pointed to the shape.
 He swore under his breath, and we both entered the dwarf's world together.
 Sure enough, it was a dwarf but there was something strangely different about this particular dwarf.
 He just walked toward us as if he wasn't afraid that I might put an arrow through his head.
 Just as I was about to release my arrow, the dwarf cried, ‚ÄúPlease stop!‚Äù I don‚Äôt know why I listened to him but I didn‚Äôt pull the string.
 The dwarf was acting different than the others; its pudgy eyes were filled with fear at the sight of my arrow.
 ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Seth growled.

 Greg:  But I couldn‚Äôt find a lipstick that matches my complexion.
 Cindy:  really, what do you do?
 Greg:  Actually I did find a lipstick that matches my complexion, I just didn‚Äôt want to go that far yet.
 Cindy:  Really?

 Greg:  How do you stand to wear these clothes?
 Cindy:  the great one himself, Ronald McDonald!

The dwarf was breathing heavily, trying to catch his breath.
 All four of us stood there waiting and when he got his breath back, he spoke.
 ‚ÄúI am glad that you accepted my message,‚Äù he said to Seth and me.
 Then he turned to Emily and Jason and said, ‚ÄúAh, it‚Äôs great to meet the other two.‚Äù He beamed at all four of us.
 ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù Emily said, looking a little freaked out.
 ‚ÄúSo now that you‚Äôre here, are we going to get a move on or what?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh of course, follow me please.‚Äù He shuffled off and disappeared behind the statue.
 Jason raised an eyebrow.
 ‚ÄúWhere is he going?‚Äù Emily sighed.
 ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only one way to find out.‚Äù She walked behind the statue.
 Seth, Jason, and I followed her.

Your mom seems like a very sensible person."
 I almost choked.
 "I love my mom, but she's the least sensible person ever.
 She spends half of her time in a different universe entirely, and only occasionally worries about the same kinds of things as other parents."
 "Ah, a dreamer, but one who still freaks out when it comes to her daughter and boys.
 Maybe she was just struck by my obvious good nature."
 I shook my head as we pulled into the parking lot.
 "Please.
 You're just about everything she's worried about in a guy.
 Rich, handsome, popular.

He gazed at her for a moment.
 "I love you, Marie.
 And if you'd stay here with me, I'd promise you that I would never, ever touch another woman."
 His words filled her with anguish.
 She could have him, but only if she stayed here.
 And she couldn't do that.
 She had to go home.
 To have Rick, she would have to give up her parents, her friends, her home.
 She loved Rick with her whole heart, but how could she .

She nodded toward the t-shirt on the pillow.
 Mrs. Tranton gazed down at her for a moment.
 "I'm sorry, darling."
 She kissed Marie's forehead and left.
 Marie curled up next to Rick's t-shirt still clutching his handkerchief.
 She felt so empty.
 She didn't sleep well that night but woke up early nevertheless.
 After bathing, she put on her emerald underwear and a simple white dress and went out into the garden.
 It didn't look so different from Rick's, she decided.
 They didn't have any white roses like he did, nor an electric fountain, but they had red roses and azaleas, just as he did.

And, really, I think, that was the end of Black Lung.
 My black period, my darkest days.
 Lor and I rented a cabin up on the White River and we just hid away.
 I didn‚Äôt write a fucking thing, didn‚Äôt even read the newspapers.
 I don‚Äôt mean to imply that I could have done something, that I had any more power than the Pope or The Beatles or, you know, fucking McNamara.
 I mean, though, that I wanted to know, I wanted to understand.
 I wanted the information that Walter Cronkite or Eric Sevareid had, the insider stuff, so that I wasn‚Äôt just up there entertaining the fuel for the fire, you know, like the orchestras that played as the Jews were led into the ovens.
 I started to feel like that, that I was a chimp, a dancing fool.
 This was like before The Moratorium, right?
 Before we really all felt the power.

"You sound disappointed.
 Do you want me to leave?"
 His expression had taken on the guarded blankness I still hadn't learned how to read, so I wasn't sure whether he was joking or not.
 "No, not disappointed, just surprised.
 I figured I'd wake up and find everything had just been one amazing, crazy dream."
 I'd hoped that my reassurance would make the mask drop, but if anything Alec was looking at me even more seriously.
 "Would you prefer things to take that course?"
 It took me several heartbeats to understand what he was getting at, long seconds in which his face grew increasingly remote.
 "No, how could you think that?
 Why would I possibly want to have you vanish when I've just now finally found out it's you who's been watching over my mom and me since we got here?"

The changes called for in this report require changes of attitude of this magnitude.
 But no longer is it necessary for a great visionary leader to espouse a new attitude.
 The higher general levels of public education, the worldwide extension of the media and the active initiative of literally thousands of institutions serving the public interest can exert a powerful force for change, which sooner or later political leaders will accept and espouse.
 What is the shift in attitudes demanded to achieve global peace and prosperity?
 From a competitive, egocentric, state-centred attitude toward national security, that seeks to enhance security for some nations at the expense of the rest of the world, to an attitude of true global cooperation for collective human security.
 From demanding that other nations grant democratic rights to their people to a willingness to extend democratic principles to the governance of international institutions.
 From preoccupation with problems and limitations to an appreciation of the opportunities for more rapid development.
 From wanting to meet people‚Äôs minimum needs to wanting to help them realize their maximum potentials.
 From the attitude that everything is determined by external constraints ‚Äì money, other nations, political leaders, the general public ‚Äì to the attitude that everything is determined by our inner resource fulness and that there are no limits to what it can accomplish.
 From viewing the developing world as a problem or a burden to viewing it as a vast untapped potential for global progress.

He reached out to squeeze her hand.
 "I've never seen a picture of her or even heard of her, but I'd bet money that she's not as sexy as you."
 Her blush deepened, and his grin mellowed into a loving smile.
 He took her hand and pressed his lips into her palm.
 "You're the most beautiful woman in the world, Marie."
 This evening was a wonderful end to a wonderful day.
 Like the day before, what Rick had enjoyed most was seeing Marie's pleasure.
 She'd wanted to see everything, experience everything they'd let her try.
 Everyone had treated her like an eager tourist, little realizing that she was seeing it all from the perspective of someone who'd seen debuts of Hollywood's earliest offerings.
 "Would you like to go dancing?"

It smelled like food.
 He reached down and tore a hunk from the spit, tossing it to me with a wink.
 When I blushed, he smiled a wicked smile.
 My mouth went dry.
 He was tall and broad with dark hair and eyes.
 Like Chevelle.
 Handsome too, I supposed, though I could tell even from these few gestures he was a bit cocky.
 He reminded me of Evelyn, always so proud of herself for finding me out.
 The stranger watched me as I ate.
 When I devoured the first piece, he laughed and threw me another.

But God will make justice come about somewhere, somehow.
 Of that much I'm convinced.
 Sylvia used to divide humanity into people of good will and the others.
 I‚Äôll use her term and ask, how could any person of good will, when confronted with plenty of evidence, circumstantial though it may be, refuse to at least hope for a God who with mercy resolves all the horrors of life here and now and makes justice happen in a golden and joyous eternity?
 So be it.
 These Days
 I'm making more time for prayer and silence, and also to meet with other people.
 I try harder to be kind, and to listen.
 I find myself on the lookout for opportunities to give.
 To make time for these pleasures, I have revised my priorities.

Worse because I was fuzzy again, bound.
 He nodded.
 He was closer now, sitting opposite me, and I had the disconcerting feeling that I‚Äôd lost the bit of time when he‚Äôd moved there.
 He reached out and took my hand in his, his fingers gentle as he turned it palm up to place a pebble there.
 ‚ÄúCan you do anything with this?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Frustration was clear in my voice.
 I had already tried.
 ‚ÄúAnd no fire?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo nothing works?‚Äù The implication was there, but I didn‚Äôt know what it meant right away.
 And then it occurred to me.
 The horse.
 I had thought he had shown up because I‚Äôd impressed upon him to follow before I blacked out, but I had already been bound again at that point.

They both confessed to the drug deal when separately interrogated.
 The officer said they had less than half of the money, which she had attempted to hide in a trash can in the Starbucks‚Äô bathroom, and Steve had a gun, which Ashley admitted they would have used if I didn‚Äôt give them the drugs once I discovered they were short on cash.
 They were going to rob me at gunpoint!
 I had literally dodged a bullet.
 Part II: After the Bust Chapter 21: When You Least Expect It The next morning I woke up before my wife and son.
 After I brewed my morning coffee, I walked down the hall and back into my bedroom where I kept the drug test in my closet.
 I walked into Brandon‚Äôs room and told him to wake up and urinate in the test cup.
 It was still early and he begged me to let him sleep a little longer, saying he hadn‚Äôt slept well.
 I insisted, and told him he could lie back down after the test.
 Since I knew he had a device called a Wizinator that is sold at smoke shops to look like you are pissing‚Äîit has a bag filled with either synthetic urine or someone else‚Äôs‚ÄîI made him show me he was really pissing.

There was a time when war could be justified as a necessary expedient.
 Now the potential human and economic costs of even limited terrorist war ‚Äì especially if it involves the use of nuclear or biological weapons, but even otherwise ‚Äì are so great that the risks are no longer tolerable.
 Because the potential risks far outweigh the possible advantages of continued reliance on this means of achieving national and international security, war has become obsolete as an instrument of policy.
 At the same time, there is no longer an insurmountable political conflict within the UN system to prevent all member countries from agreeing to a total ban on the use of violence against each other.
 It is time for the UN to declare war itself a crime against humanity and to ban from membership any nation that engages in aggression against another.
 Even if this intention cannot immediately be made effective, the adoption of this Peace Imperative would mark a milestone in human affairs.
 There is no rational or practical obstacle to the immediate adoption of this measure.
 As a starting point, it can be demonstrated that with the right perspective, courage and commitment, practical immediate solutions are possible for any and all of the conflicts presently raging.
 Recent failures of international diplomacy do not contradict this assertion, they confirm it.
 War must, and can, be abolished.

I do feel something now and then, but I have never been tested.
 People see me and how strong I am, they just assume I don‚Äôt have magic for some reason.‚Äù ‚ÄúWish I had that problem,‚Äù Rodregas said.
 ‚ÄúI mean before, people always used to assume I had neither brawn nor brains.‚Äù With a smile he added, ‚ÄúWhat do you say?
 Shall the three of us set some time aside to teach each other what we know of magic and see what we can learn from these magic books of Ravenhurr‚Äôs?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúI mean, yes, I would like to learn what you can teach me.
 I like to learn,‚Äù he said slowly but carefully.
 The big guy was embarrassed.
 Then he added, ‚ÄúI am afraid my people are not big readers, and, well, they saw me as half-monster and I never learned how to read.‚Äù The last words he added very slowly, but then quickly added, ‚ÄúBut if you can teach me some basics from the oral techniques that Imeralda mentioned, I would like to learn some magic if I can.‚Äù Rodregas looked at Doi‚Äôvan; there was something about his expression, a yearning.
 ‚ÄúDo you want to learn to read?‚Äù he asked.

It was just a really bad fight.
 I've never said those kinds of things to anyone.
 I don't think there's any going back.
 She has to hate me."
 Brandon shook his head and flashed another of his winning smiles, albeit one with an overtone of sympathy.
 "I'm sure it isn't as bad as that."
 I wanted to disagree, to go into detail about why my life had just taken a turn for the worse, but something about his manner was suddenly distant.
 I thought about calling him out on it, but with my life suddenly looking like I was all but friendless, that didn't seem like such a good idea.
 Without really meaning to I'd managed to alienate just about everyone at school.
 Brandon already had plenty of reasons not to be with me, it was the height of stupidity to give him any more.

‚ÄúA present from a half-orc,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúShould I be worried?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúNope.
 Just take it.‚Äù He held out a small brown box.
 It was in poor shape, picked out of a heap of trash, but the elf could see the great care spent attempting to clean and fix it.
 ‚ÄúWhat is inside?‚Äù she asked as she took the box.
 ‚ÄúOpen it,‚Äù Harruq said.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see.‚Äù
 Aurelia pried off the lid and peered inside.
 A small bouquet of flowers lay on the bottom of the box.

This is tearing me apart.
 I want to spend my life with you.
 But I have to go home."
 "I'll never love another woman the way I love you.
 I can't even imagine how I'm going to deal with the void you're about to create."
 Tears sparkled in her eyes.
 "I'm sorry."
 "I know."
 He kissed her then, slowly, sweetly, longingly, trying to memorize the taste and feel of her mouth.
 He wanted to deepen the kiss, to evoke the passion he knew only too well that she was capable of, but such a kiss would be torture for both of them.

Education replaces the slow, subconscious process of trial and error learning with a swift, conscious process.
 This accumulated knowledge is a great power that can be utilized to accelerate human development and abridge the time needed for society to arrive at progressively higher levels of material, social and psychological fulfilment.
 Despite the massive efforts of international institutions to create awareness of the vital role of education in peace, democracy, economic development, population control and environmental protection, progress on extending the benefits of education to all humankind is still grossly inadequate.
 In 1990, 948 million people or about 20 per cent of the entire world population lacked even basic literacy skills.
 Adult literacy rates in the least developed nations still average less than 50 per cent and are less than half that in a number of countries.
 Unless more intensive efforts are made, worldwide the absolute number of the illiterate will decline only marginally by the year 2000.
 Illiteracy is likely to increase by 10 per cent in South Asia ‚Äì home to more than 40 per cent of the world‚Äôs illiterate ‚Äì and by nearly 7 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa.
 Although universal primary education has been a goal for decades and primary education has been made compulsory in most countries, 128 million children living in remote rural areas, urban slums and refugee camps ‚Äì representing 20 per cent of the total school-age population ‚Äì are still excluded from primary education.
 Unless greater measures are introduced, this number may rise to more than 160 million by the turn of the century.
 Achieving true universality of primary education by the year 2000 will require a massive investment in school buildings, teachers and instructional materials for an additional 230 million school-age children.

I didn't realize you even had anyone working today."
 Mom listened for several more seconds and then hung up.
 "They just sent the money.
 Apparently it's for real.
 The bank president was just calling to tell me the money has been confirmed, subject to my accepting the job."
 Now was the time to strike.
 "Mom, go call Mr. Peters, and I'll start pulling your stuff together."
 It's amazing how quickly you can pack when it's for someone else, and they aren't around to tell you what you can or can't throw into their suitcase.
 Even with my lack of sleep starting to catch up with me, I was still essentially done by the time Mom wandered into her room, staring at her phone like she wasn't sure it was really possible for it to have just told her what she'd just heard.
 "He says it's fine.

Not too much to tell really.
 My brother and I grew up in Veldaren, and about three months ago the king kicked out all elves.

 The half-orc chuckled, but still kept his eyes downward.

 Dad was an elf.

since the morning they'd left for Hollywood.
 Had that been only nine days ago?
 It seemed like a long time.
 Rick was in the hall waiting for her.
 She blushed when she looked into his eyes.
 She'd spent the previous evening cuddled up to him, returning the gentle kisses he'd kept raining on her lips.
 Rick had kissed her more times last night than Davis had the entire time they'd been together, and she couldn't look at him without thinking of those kisses.
 Silently Rick took her hand and led her downstairs.
 In the garden, he took her face between his hands, kissing her softly.
 "If you get home, I'll miss you."

He asked why I got so obsessed about Karen, knowing I never had pursued anybody else so boldly.
 Should anybody except Karen want a date with me, she had better tell her friend to pass the word along.
 I wouldn‚Äôt even ask any other girl for a dance without having already gotten the nod.
 Karen had pink, full lips and plenty of curves, and lively unhaunted eyes.
 She read books for fun and spoke softly, humbly, and acted just as nice to the lowly as to teachers or big shots.
 Besides, I had lately spent a day and evening, first at school, then at a community dance, and afterward at the Burger Hut, asking people whether they often felt guilty about something but had no idea what it was.
 I asked thirty or forty kids.
 Only one said no.
 Karen.
 Since then, I had spent many hours dreaming that she and I could run off to live in some woodland cottage.

History was a complete waste of time.
 I hadn't even made it through the reading assignment, and I still got a perfect score on the pop quiz.
 Physics was surprisingly full.
 Apparently Alec was the only hard-core party animal in the class.
 I was still feeling weird from Britney's story, so unlike the rest of my classmates, who seemed genuinely intrigued by the assignment, I just pretended to leaf through a reference book all hour.
 Spanish was as bad as history.
 Mrs. Tiggs turned on one of the Spanish TV channels within thirty seconds of class starting.
 Towards the end of the hour I finally started to come back out of my funk, so I put the last few minutes to good use reviewing vocabulary for the quiz on Tuesday.
 I felt a momentary surge of relief when class ended, but the feeling evaporated when I remembered I had to go to math tutoring.
 I grabbed my math book, and met an equally morose Britney at her locker.

Then I realized what his arrival really meant.
 Rachel had stood me up.
 She wasn't on the bus, and she apparently hadn't come with her brother, so she wasn't coming.
 I knew I should reserve judgment until I'd given her a chance to explain what'd happened, but it was hard to remember that when faced with Alec's air of superiority.
 Rachel was nicer, but she was still a Graves.
 Maybe this was just a sign of things to come.
 Apparently I wasn't the only one put off by Alec's snobbishness.
 A couple of guys who looked like they were old enough to be in college were rolling their eyes at him.
 They were whispering and laughing, but positioned as they were closer to Alec than to me, I couldn't make out any of what they were saying.
 While I agreed completely with their sentiment, they were so loud they were disturbing at least twenty or thirty people.

Rutted, gorged, and fell asleep ready for the slaughter.
 Rodregas could not help but shake his head at how life can show you miracles that made you want to live again, and that using the same miracle drives home the fact that there is truly no justice to existence.
 His eyes jerked back to Ravenhurr, as the sorcerer made a jerking motion, rising up from his sky tube.
 ‚ÄúNow,‚Äù he said and quickly repeated in his deep but smooth voice, ‚ÄúNOW!‚Äù Captain Poir, the leader of Ravenhurr‚Äôs guards, had stepped out of the shadows and approached the prisoners, but Rodregas stepped forward first and grabbed the half AElf maiden‚Äôs arm.
 With a quick twist of the key he removed her iron shackles but grabbed her arm hard so she could not run.
 ‚ÄúThis way,‚Äù Rodregas said to her.
 As he separated her from the male prisoner he whispered to her, ‚ÄúIf you want to live, don‚Äôt do anything until your circle starts to burn, then I will throw the club at the other guard.
 Run and make sure you get out of the circle.‚Äù She jerked towards him as he spoke and Rodregas was struck once again by the beauty of her amazing eyes, but he forced her forward hoping that she could think on her feet.
 Rodregas carefully led her over the outer white circle and into a yellow circle that was across from the Celestial Lion.
 Captain Poir led the man into the pale green circle that was the closest to being in the exact middle and was most strongly interconnected to the other circles.

"OK." "I need to go get dressed now--I have to go to work."
 "To work?"
 "Yeah.
 Come on--I'll make you some breakfast, and you'll feel better."
 He took her hand and led her back to the house.
 Her fear had returned.
 Not fear of being stuck in 2011 but of spending the day without Rick.
 What would she do?
 She showered while Rick did the same in his bathroom, and she washed her hair with some shampoo she found on the edge of the tub.
 It smelled nice, and she found herself wishing for some perfume or some bath oil.

Rising incomes generate higher standards and expectations, bringing changes in lifestyle that create new needs and new commercial activities.
 This process has led to enormous growth in new jobs.
 The best documented example of this process is the automotive industry.
 Inspired by the idea of making a car the working-class masses at the turn of the century could afford, Henry Ford adopted new manufacturing technology, the automated assembly line, to produce the first low-priced automobile.
 Ford‚Äôs technology increased worker productivity more than seven-fold and reduced production costs by two-thirds.
 As an immediate result, thousands of small manufacturers of custom-built cars and horse-drawn carriages were put out of business.
 But the growing demand for low-cost vehicles generated explosive growth for the industry, creating tens of thousands of new jobs in the process.
 Globally, production rose from less than 250,000 vehicles in 1910 to 42 million in 1980.
 Nine decades later, the automotive industry is still the largest manufacturing industry in the world and the single largest source of jobs in the American economy.
 Every job created in automotive manufacturing has spawned roughly ten more in related occupations.

"The boy's name's Ben.
 I'm not sure why she's fixated on him the way she has, or why she views Lucy as such a deadly threat to her chances with him, but it's essentially that simple."
 I felt like my head should be reeling from the sheer stupidity.
 Even in a town this small, it didn't seem like the competition for the available males should be a matter for death threats.
 Brandon took my head shaking as denial of what he'd said, rather than disbelief regarding the situation.
 "I promise that every word I just told you is true.
 More importantly, I promise I'll make sure nothing terrible happens to you."
 Looking into Brandon's caring eyes, I almost couldn't believe any of it.
 Being threatened and then having the perfect man come to your rescue didn't happen in real life.
 Then again, maybe I was due for some happy endings.

I've been worried all day someone would stump me on something right out of the gate on my first day."
 Rachel looked up at me through dark lashes as I stood.
 "I've wanted to say thanks for a while.
 I really appreciate you making Cassie back down yesterday.
 Nobody else has ever stood up for me like that.
 At least not people that I didn't already know."
 Based on what I'd seen less than thirty hours ago, it didn't look like her friends stood up for her either.
 "No worries, it just seemed like the thing to do at the time.
 Why did she want to hurt you anyways?"
 Rachel looked down, but somehow it wasn't a gesture that conveyed guilt.

From the night sky came the sound of soft wing beats.
 Then a white, winged horse swooped down, landing in front of Dieredon.
 ‚ÄúCome, Sonowin,‚Äù the elf said to his cherished companion.
 ‚ÄúLet us leave this place while it is still in peace.‚Äù
 The beautiful creature neighed in agreement.
 Dieredon mounted Sonowin, needing no reins or saddle.

 ‚ÄúStay safe, friend,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúYou as well, friend.‚Äù
 Before the elf took to the sky, however, he paused.

"It gives me no pleasure to tell you this, but based on your initial test score I think you should prepare yourself for the fact that you're probably going to fail this class.
 I worried this would be the result of your starting so late in the semester and not having any prior Spanish experience.
 Unfortunately, it's now too late for you to switch into another class.
 I'm afraid you'll just have to take the failing grade."
 I stood there woodenly for several seconds, unsure whether or not she was through.
 She finally made a shooing motion and turned back to grading papers.
 Predictably, there were still a half-dozen other kids in the classroom.
 They all turned back to the door and started filing out again, but by tomorrow half the school would know exactly how badly I'd just been humiliated.
 I found myself just outside the tutor lab with no recollection of having stumbled to my locker, or going by Physics to grab the stuff I'd left there.
 Still, somehow my Spanish book had disappeared, replaced by my math book.

I panicked when I realized just how badly I wanted to slip back into that twilight world where nothing hurt, where it didn't matter if people liked me or not.
 The one where I still had all three of the most important people in my world.
 The fear that I'd give in, that I'd end up in a hospital during the day or two it took Mom to realize I hadn't made it home from school, pulled me back sooner than normal.
 For a second my mind inhabited a body that wouldn't obey any of the normal commands.
 Fear snaked out from my center when my eyes wouldn't open, but before my heart could really start accelerating, my eyelids started functioning again.
 The desks on the route between Alec and I were lying haphazardly on their sides, but there wasn't any sign of Alec.
 Mrs. Alexander was looking down at me, concern etched into her features, and the beginnings of a crowd was starting to form as the rest of the students came over to look at the freak.
 Only something wasn't right.
 They weren't towering enough.
 When you pass out on a regular basis, you get used to finding yourself on the floor surrounded by concerned-looking people, but none of these people were looming properly.

I drew the line at a swimsuit, since there was no way on earth I'd ever wear one, and then felt so bad at how crushed Rachel was that I let her drag me into a store full of formals.
 It was a mistake because I soon found myself being zipped into a delicate, green dress that I was absolutely positive wasn't going to survive the experience of trying to wrap itself around me.
 "Oh, it's perfect, Adri.
 We have to get it."
 I avoided looking at the mirror.
 It seemed like a crime to defile such a pretty dress, and I wanted to remember it like it had looked on the hanger, all shimmery and wispy.
 I did risk a look down at the price tag.
 My heart actually skipped a beat.
 That was more than some people spent on their first car.
 "Rachel, you've already bought me way too much.

I concentrated as hard as I could and, though nothing flitted out of the shelves and onto my desk, I had a strong feeling I knew where the documents were.
 It also could have been that I knew where they had fallen from the day before.
 Regardless, I made my way over and took a few volumes and scrolls back to my secluded table.
 I was able to find several documents on the northern clans and even one of the missing pages of names‚ÄîL.
 I had spread them out on the table and was studiously examining them when a shadow crossed my desk.
 I realized someone was standing there and distractedly glanced up to see who.
 My instinct to breathe deserted me.
 It was Chevelle Vattier.
 Chapter Three Black Roots
 Chevelle stood there, staring down at me, as I leaned halfway across the table of documents concerning the northern clans.

‚ÄúThe dwarf said to meet him tomorrow morning near ‚Äòthe thorn that reaches the sky.‚Äô What does that mean anyway?‚Äù Jason stepped over and spoke instead of Emily, who was furiously writing everything down, as if she‚Äôd forget in a couple of seconds, ‚ÄúIt could be a description of something in town, maybe a building or a landmark.‚Äù I suddenly got an idea and took another piece of paper out.
 ‚ÄúHey Jason maybe you could draw what you think it might be and that would help us.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try my best, Jazell,‚Äù he said.
 I knew that his drawing would probably help us.
 He was the best artist I knew, his artwork was almost real.
 ‚ÄúHey guys,‚Äù Emily piped up from her paper, ‚ÄúI think we should get home and speak to our parents.
 I want to see what this dwarf was talking about when he said that everything was already arranged.‚Äù ‚ÄúI agree.‚Äù I grabbed my backpack.
 ‚ÄúWait, are we going to go?‚Äù Seth and Jason grinned at me and said together, ‚ÄúYou bet.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat is if we can find the place,‚Äù Emily reminded them.
 I turned the door knob and walked into the kitchen.
 My mom and dad were sitting in the living room looking extremely excited.
 Before I even had a chance to say hi, my mom jumped up and rushed over to me.

But the high current costs of the unemployed certainly suggest that there are more constructive ways to spend available resources to solve the problem.
 Instead, a commitment to self-employment should lead the government to reexamine and where necessary alter the nature of its priorities and policies and the structure of its economic system in order to make achievement of this goal possible.
 The magnitude of the task and the prescription may vary, but the goal and determination can be shared by all.
 Employment Strategies for the Industrial Nations
 In the industrial countries, the phenomena of jobless growth coupled with persistently high rates of youth unemployment and of chronic unemployment among the poorer sections will not be eradicated by even the most optimistic rates of economic expansion or mere incremental adjustments within the context of present attitudes and policies.
 Although the problem has been aggravated by a variety of short- and medium-term factors whose effects will gradually dissipate over time ‚Äì defence cuts, recession, East European economic crisis, German reunification, etc.
 ‚Äì the present job crisis among Western nations is largely structural in nature.
 Although conditions vary from country to country, the crisis impacts most heavily on the unskilled, young people, urban poor, ethnic minorities and older workers.
 Specific programmes to effect structural changes will have to be introduced in order to ensure a fair opportunity to all, especially minority youth, to lead economically active lives.
 It is in this context that the European Union, the United States and other Western governments have been considering ambitious proposals for addressing this issue.

"This is one thing I have to talk to my mother about."
 "What?"
 "How your touch makes me feel."
 She released a shaky sigh, hiding her hands in her lap.
 "Everything you do makes me feel this way.
 When you kiss me, when you kiss my neck, when you pressed me against the car.
 And yesterday when you kissed my back.
 No one else has ever made me feel like this.
 How can it be that your kissing my back makes my heart pound harder than Davis' kissing my lips?"
 "Because you love me."

It seemed like I couldn‚Äôt quite catch my breath anymore.
 Reaching inside to draw out the long white gown, I could not fathom Junnie‚Äôs reasoning.
 But she must have gone through much to get me this package.
 Numbly, I stared at her words while I unfastened my shirt and sash.
 The pouch I had rescued from the vault fell to the bed.
 How had I forgotten?
 I kicked off my shoes and pulled my top and pants off before sliding the gown over my head, straightening the length with my hands.
 The corset laced tight at my waist, the plunging neckline lower than anything I would ever wear.
 I retrieved the leather pouch from the bed to examine the contents, but before I loosened the binding I heard a crash behind me; three council guards had busted open my door.
 I tucked the pouch under the long bell sleeve of the dress as they crossed the room to seize me by the arms.

The resulting number of questions kept us all jumping.
 I started work half an hour early, and Albert, Peter and Mrs. Campbell all stayed an extra forty-five minutes.
 I was helping out an undersized freshman who was having a really hard time understanding the fundamental concepts of the unit she was going to be tested over tomorrow when Mrs. Campbell stopped by.
 "We're all done.
 Wait until the end of your normal shift, and then go home.
 If anyone complains feel free to suggest that they don't leave it until the last minute next time."
 There was plenty of grumbling when I announced that the lab was over, but nobody actually said anything.
 Rachel was waiting for me at the door as everyone else filed out.
 She looked up guiltily as I made my way over to her.
 "Did you have a good day?

So long as the benefits of development are confined to one or a few sections of society, the costs of militarization and war may not prevent economic and social progress.
 But when the need is to fulfil the rising expectations of the masses by extending the benefits of development to the entire society ‚Äì thus enabling the society as a whole to move to the next higher level of collective affluence and fulfilment ‚Äì every social resource must be garnered and harnessed for this purpose.
 The colossal cost of armaments and the catastrophic destruction of war are incompatible with the achievement of prosperity for all.
 Peace has become the fundamental imperative for development.
 War as an Instrument of Policy
 Humanity has lived with war for so many millennia that it is difficult to imagine a world without it.
 Even in the four decades of ‚Äòpeace‚Äô following the Second World War, approximately 160 inter-state and intra-state wars, including 100 major conflicts, have been fought in developing countries, leading directly to 20 million deaths ‚Äì half of them caused by the armed forces of developed countries in Korea, Indochina, Algeria and other anti-colonial wars ‚Äì and to another 20 million war-related casualties.
 These massive casualties during a time of ‚Äòpeace‚Äô are roughly equal to the total casualties incurred by all the countries of the world during the last world war.
 An equally disturbing phenomenon has been the expansion of violence within society for political purposes.
 Of the 82 armed conflicts between 1989 and 1992, only three were between states.

He kept using his sword more to block than to attack and kept using his shield offensively.
 This allowed him to take advantage of his unnatural strength to overwhelm his foes.
 According to the contest rules, he could replace his shield after every fourth match if need be.
 By the final match, he was on his third and final shield.
 Most of the rest of the matches were with squires with no ribbons.
 But as the afternoon wrapped up his final match was against Karun who had two second place white ribbons on her arm.
 Rodregas was pretty sure this match would decide who got the yellow first place ribbon and who would get the white.
 If Rodregas won it would give him ten total points after three competitions.
 It would give Karun twelve points if she once more came in second.
 If he lost, it would be much harder.

We just learned to live with it and survive.
 We became quite the fighters at school and other kids learned not to screw with us or we would beat them down.
 It was just something one gets good at when one is in constant training.
 My parents‚ÄîI had been instructed to refer to Dino as my father‚Äîentertained a lot.
 The rooms would fill with drinkers and drunks, for it was the seventies and the cocktails were flowing freely.
 The money was coming in heavy and Mom and Dino lived a lavish lifestyle.
 They went out to dinner at fancy restaurants often, and everyone knew their names as they entered.
 He had his own table at several places and the same personal waiter.
 He was treated like royalty.
 I remember he would carry a rare $1000 bill and attempt to pay his bill with it to shock the waiters, who would say, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt change that!‚Äù My mom was wearing fur coats and new jewelry all the time.

I finally realized what I'd always thought of as grace was really an economy of motion.
 It was like he was saving every possible bit of energy because he never knew when he'd find it necessary to burn up his reserves in a blaze of violence.
 Even as I watched, he spun around, plucking Jessica out of the air, grabbing her by the head mid-leap as she sought to find purchase on this throat.
 He tried to spin back around to meet James' rush, but the smaller hybrid knocked him down with a crash.
 Isaac and Jasmin were there in a blink, tearing the other two wolves off of Alec before the conflict could turn deadly.
 I couldn't breathe until the dust settled, and Alec rolled back up to his feet, dripping blood from a large gash in his side.
 Dominic heard my sudden gasp and reached over to reassure me.
 "He's okay.
 We heal fast, and he heals faster than most."
 "So this isn't normal?"

A very pretty Hispanic girl placed a gentle hand on his arm, but he shook her hand off and let out a sound that was uncomfortably close to a growl.
 "You selfish jerk.
 You've been mooning over her for weeks.
 You've got her now, but at what cost?
 This isn't open to discussion.
 We're taking her back to Brandon and asking for leniency."
 In an effort to see better, Rachel and I had moved slightly to the side.
 Alec reached back without looking and moved us directly behind him.
 It wasn't until his arm brushed me that I realized he was shaking ever so slightly himself.
 "There's only one way you're going to touch her, James.

‚ÄúYou have given me a sword, if a small one, and among my people that is a powerful gesture.
 I will not lie to you, I have left my old life behind and the last few years I have learned to truly hate the Immortalists.
 I travel with you only because the others were going to go back to their homes, and I have no home to go back to,‚Äù he seemed to finish, but then added, ‚ÄúLast night you pointed out that the forces of the Immortalists would be after you and you would fight them.
 And you also proved that you can fight.‚Äù Once again he paused.
 He was clearly a man that liked to think before he spoke.
 ‚ÄúI am simply using you as bait.
 When they come for you, I will kill them.
 Fighting together we will kill some of their vaulted Immortal Guards.‚Äù As Doi‚Äôvan finished he gave a low growl and shook his horned head, his thick mane of wild jet black hair was almost as distinctive as Imeralda‚Äôs own auburn flowing locks.
 But with Doi‚Äôvan the gesture spoke of defiance and challenge like some great bull lowing his horns and getting ready to charge.
 Until now he had seemed very thoughtful, almost careful in the words he spoke, but when he spoke of killing and shook his head in defiance his mouth widened.

The reform programme involved the dismantling of most of the administrative mechanisms by which an economy can be monitored and controlled by government.
 In place of free market conditions, organized crime and corruption became rampant.
 In seeking to reject thoroughly the authoritarian form of government that suppressed the rights of the people, many of these countries allowed the power and authority of their central governments to de cline to the point where they could no longer enforce conditions needed for operation of either a command economy or a free market system.
 The power of government in the West may be veiled by the fact that its laws are usually obeyed without the need for exercise of force, but the threat of enforcement is as real for tax evaders in North America as it was for free marketers under the communist regime in USSR.
 Regardless of the system, strong government is a prerequisite for a strong economy.
 The experience of the past few years has clearly demonstrated that the state must play a very active role in order to bring about a smooth and rapid transition and this role cannot be limited purely to regulation of the market.
 Intervention will also be necessary in the form of central planning and industrial policy, at least¬†during the transition period.
 The radical restructuring of entire industries ‚Äì defence, agriculture, aluminium, steel ‚Äì is too complex and massive an undertaking to be made the responsibility of market forces and individual firms.
 7.Agriculture has to be given a special status: For reasons discussed in the previous chapter, the state has an especially important role in the regulation of agriculture.
 After the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, the rise of free market and free trade polemics generated considerable confusion regarding the necessity and legitimacy of state regulation and intervention in protecting and preserving agriculture, which is the beneficiary of innumerable subsidies and supports in virtually every industrialized nation.

 look."
 Marie smiled.
 She hadn't even thought about binding her chest again, a convention that her mother had never understood or liked.
 She'd always thought she was too well endowed to look good in any of the clothes she liked, but now she couldn't imagine binding it.
 Besides, she liked wearing the lacy bras she'd brought from 2011.
 "Marie," her mother said quietly, taking her daughter's arm as they left the store, "does the young man you met have anything to do with your decision to stop binding your chest?"
 "He just told me that that's not the style in--where he lives.

I'd starve to death before anyone found me."
 Donovan's laugh was surprisingly relaxed.
 I'd only ever seen him with a serious, if respectful expression.
 Even Rachel's frequent teasing hadn't ever managed to crack his 'working face'.
 "I hardly think that would be the case.
 While you may very well have lost your way, it would have been a small matter for one of the others to track you down.
 You have, if I may say so, a very distinctive smell.
 It reminds me of a type of sage brush that hasn't grown here in quite some time."
 His sigh was more felt than heard, and it put me in mind of mountains, redwoods, and other ancient things.
 "Donovan, can I ask you a question?"

 ‚ÄúNo, we just want the truth,‚Äù Emily said sweetly.
 ‚ÄúYeah okay, whatever.‚Äù Seth shoved his hands in his pockets, and glared at the ground.
 I sat on one of the swings next to Emily.
 I traced the sticky metal rings and sighed.
 Emily was on her phone.

Chevelle Vattier had been a volunteer watcher.
 A Council spy.
 He had volunteered to watch me.
 Swift, white-hot anger flooded through me and the pages I held burst into flames.
 The brush around me caught next, burning away as I stood to push free of the blazing patch of briars.
 They had set a watcher on me.
 Why?
 Because Fannie had practiced dark magic?
 Were they afraid she‚Äôd teach me?
 I‚Äôd show them dark magic.

With the memory came concern for Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda, and a surge of adrenaline that gave him the energy to try to wake up.
 Rodregas tried to sit up, but his body, which had been so strong since that day at Raven Keep, now only responded sluggishly.
 He was sleepy, but had the idea that he had been sleeping a very long time.
 Yet, his body still felt exhausted.
 Rodregas must have moved enough to get some attention because a man, or to be more accurate, an adult male Nymph, moved into his sight.
 Rodregas was always surprised by the amount of hair coming out of the ears of an adult Nymph.
 He was glad that was one trait that Imeralda did not seem to have.
 He knew the thought to be a silly one even as it crossed his mind.
 It was quickly replaced with concern.
 For a second he thought that he was tied down, but Rodregas could see enough to determine that his restraints were tightly tucked bed sheets.

I could get past that and see he was a jerk, but that was just because girls seemed to be wired a little different.
 None of it made sense.
 If Jasmin was dating Alec, why was she so mad at Lucy for talking to this Ben boy?
 I hadn't seen any other boys who were even close to as attractive as Alec and Brandon, and Jasmin didn't seem like the type to pick substance over form.
 Britney had wandered off to other, safer subjects.
 I nodded a lot and tried to avoid thinking about what life was going to be like if Jasmin was determined to kill me.
 There was just no way to know if I'd made the right choice in leaving when I did.
 Would Cassie hate me a little less because we were both potentially in Jasmin's crosshairs, or would she hate me all the more because I'd seen her humiliated and forced to back down?
 I finally finished the little can that represented my lunch.
 I wasn't particularly hungry, but I couldn't lose much more weight without Mom dragging me into a doctor.

Crap!
 I stubbed my toe on a root, one of the pitfalls of living in a tree.
 It throbbed and I slammed the door in frustration as I left the tree.
 It only took a moment to realize what I‚Äôd done.
 I picked up the pace as Aunt Fannie‚Äôs curses came screaming through the closed door.
 She was determined not to let me forget what a burden it had been to take me in, even if it used every spare ounce of energy to do it.
 My mouth twisted, and I shifted into a run until I reached the little outcropping of rock on the west side of the village.
 I was still thinking about it when I slowed to climb through the tangle of brush in back of Junnie‚Äôs house, but once my fingers trailed the cool rock surrounding the structure, it fell away.
 When it felt as if I could breathe again, I rapped two quick knocks and then one loud knock on the small wooden door.
 It was the one sure way she‚Äôd know it was me.

‚ÄúSir Paladin,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan asked, ‚ÄúYou said you traveled here the first time with friends.
 Might they tell folks of this place?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Rodregas answered, ‚Äúthey were not exactly friends, and they both died long ago.
 Plus, they had no magic and did not even realize this place was on a ley line, and I never told them.
 They just saw an old farm house in bad repair.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo, what now,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan asked?
 ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚ÄúI think we should just sleep here tonight.
 We can try the house in the morning.
 But I don‚Äôt want to disturb the Dire Cats during the night.‚Äù They both nodded.
 They had come to the same thought already.
 ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚Äúhere.‚Äù He pulled out one of the extra short swords and its harness from where he had it stashed in the wagon and handed it to Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúIf you guys promise not to stab me in the night, it makes sense for you two to be armed.

I won.
 But success isn't the point.
 The point is, when we're stumped, or stuck, and we ask God, if an answer comes, we had better heed it.
 Okay, I think.
 I will write about reading Brother Lawrence and this trip before the next novel or anything else gets in my way.
 And by the end, I vow, I will know better how to adore God.
 Which, for reasons I‚Äôll soon learn, turns me once again to thoughts of Eric.
 After a mile or so I‚Äôm questioning whether, on that Sunday as he walked over the hill between Sylvia's house and Kenny Niedermeyer's, Eric got handed the choice to save me and/or Billy, or to save himself.
 The only answer I receive is a maybe.
 But all I need is to recognize the long shot possibility that the dearest person I have known gave his life for me and, despite the sorrow, my heart leaps with adoration.

 ‚ÄúAre you a half-ling?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, how did you know?

 ‚ÄúWell you can't be a faery because you don't have the ears and you can't be a pixie because they're always giggling around.

 ‚ÄúI don't know, it's this new power I have.
 My friend has one too.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat sounds like the other one.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù she asked.

 ‚ÄúI must go, friend.
 Good luck.‚Äù It took off into the sky and Emily couldn't see it anymore.

"Is he the reason you ended your betrothal?"
 "In a way.
 I didn't have a chance to tell you about the last time I was with Davis.
 You and Father were out, and we came here to listen to the radio.
 He kissed me, which was wonderful at first.
 But then he started kissing me so hard that my teeth cut into my lips, and I tried to push him away, but he wouldn't stop.
 And he put his hand under my skirt to touch my leg.
 I was finally able to push him away, and all he said was to make sure that you told me what my duties would be once we were married."
 Mrs. Tranton's eyes blazed.
 "Your father is going to kill him.

Her family had all received the calling ‚Äúto serve elfkind.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know exactly what that meant, only that the elf usually left with fanfare and seldom returned in fewer than a hundred years.
 It was apparently a very honorable thing, though she never seemed proud.
 Just off the living area was the study, larger than the front room, stuffed full of documents and lit by a pair of dim oil lanterns.
 Dust covered the decrepit scrolls and books lining the walls, but aside from a well-used worktable, the room was clean.
 Settling onto my usual stool, I leaned forward, elbows on the carved edge of the table to prop my head up for the monotonous hours to come.
 It was hard to say how long I sat so, looking down on a huge volume entitled The Great Elves of Varkenshire, pretending to read.
 But my eyes had wandered from the page to a small thistle where it rested among some other potion ingredients.
 It had begun to extend its leaves.
 I was startled; Junnie was preoccupied with a lengthy scroll across the room and couldn‚Äôt have possibly been the source, and I had never made anything grow.
 I concentrated on the thistle then, eyeing each tiny spike.

I think acid was illegal.
 Is it legal now?
 No, no, it‚Äôs not.
 LSD-25, specifically, you know, I mean, everyone had it‚Äîit came to Memphis from Frisco on sugar cubes, I think.
 It was at the Bitter Lemon, you know, and I‚Äôd go there‚ÄîI was, shit, I don‚Äôt know, 16 or something.
 Man.
 Anyway, did I use it to write?
 Some, I guess.
 It opens doors, if you want to do that.

‚ÄúThe tournament is held twenty days after the autumn equinox at the Great Cathedral of Oravue.
 I believe that to be in about ten days and it is about a seven day ride from here,‚Äù said Rodregas.
 ‚ÄúYou would challenge for knighthood,‚Äù said Imeralda quietly.
 ‚ÄúThat is not a bad idea, while the Guild will be on the hunt for you, they would not expect you to be in such an event, and you will be surrounded by other warriors.
 They would have no room to suspect you.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere are a few problems.
 I would need to show proof that I was a squire, which I have,‚Äù said Rodregas.
 As he spoke he reached into his pouch and pulled out his old Squire patch.
 He showed them the old beaten cloth, the one memento that he had taken with him from his old life.
 The only problem would be if someone asked too many questions about when and where he had trained.
 ‚ÄúIt might not work,‚Äù said Rodregas.

Did she somehow know that I wasn't telling her the whole story?
 I looked at Seth out of the corner of my eye and saw him doing the same.
 We needed to talk longer and more in depth about the situation we were sharing.
 ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Emily said and tapped her fingers on the cave wall, ‚Äúis that all?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell then,‚Äù she looked us in the eyes, ‚Äúwhat are we waiting for?
 Let's get a move on and leave this small, damp cave.‚Äù I shrugged and followed her out.
 The sky was lit but still had a gloomy feeling mixed in with the warmth.
 I felt a sense of dread as we entered the never-ending forest again.
 A few rays fought their way through the thick canopy of trees, making it possible to see what was around you.
 Seth led the way as we followed a faint path through the unknown.
 I was bringing up the rear of the line, Emily in front of me.

 Does anybody need another ‚ÄúTurntable Poison?‚Äù  I don‚Äôt.
 I fucking don‚Äôt.
 What I need is to keep moving‚ÄîI‚Äôm repeating myself‚Äîbut all this nostalgia shit, man, it‚Äôs for people who are dead.
 What did Dylan say?
 ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs going on here but you don‚Äôt know what it is.‚Äù  That‚Äôs it, man.
 When he plugged in he changed music, but he can‚Äôt plug in again, you know?
 And he went backwards after that, because he‚Äôs the jester, man, and by going backwards, like Merlin, he was going forward.
 Dylan‚Äôs always been a bellwether, though he hates that thought.
 I don‚Äôt want to be anyone‚Äôs bellwether, either.

Then I got up, swallowed a few aspirin, and roused Eric to tell him about my adventure.
 ‚ÄúI was on one side of a bottomless gorge, looking across at this forest of evergreens and fruit trees, with all the colors so bright they looked lighted from inside.
 The forest was on an endless slope.
 There wasn‚Äôt any horizon.
 And the music, each note contained all kinds of harmonies, all at once.
 And the instruments sounded like giant bells, big as mountains, far away.‚Äù Eric had sat up.
 His eyes bored into mine.
 ‚ÄúWere you scared?
 What‚Äôs it feel like there?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou know when you‚Äôre away from home and no matter how great a time you‚Äôre having, you‚Äôre still a bit uneasy, so when you get home you always feel relieved?
 You unwind, your heart slows.

All four of us hang out every day.‚Äù ‚ÄúI can solve that problem.
 We just tell them we want a day to do girl things and they‚Äôll butt right out,‚Äù she slid onto the floor and snatched a strawberry.
 I grinned, ‚ÄúThis is going to be some fun revenge!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou can say that again.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúthis is going to be some fun revenge.‚Äù She wacked me in the head with my pillow, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so weird.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs the way I am, deal with it,‚Äù I wacked her back with my own pillow.
 ‚ÄúNo I will not deal with it,‚Äù she walloped me in the head one more time.
 ‚ÄúI need you for team penguin, and I don‚Äôt need a smarty pants.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow come you get to name the team?‚Äù I asked.
 ‚ÄúBecause I was the one who got shot first.‚Äù Early the next day, which wasn‚Äôt that early because we got up around ten o‚Äôclock, we gathered my old water gun and some water balloons.
 Emily brought down the trebuchet she‚Äôd spent all night building and we took off on our bikes.
 Emily led the way to Jason‚Äôs where she was pretty sure the boys would be.
 We hid our bikes in the trees and snuck up to their backyard.
 Jason and Seth appeared to be setting up some airplane that they built from scratch.

 Karen ‚Äì (laughing) That is almost the exact same thing happened to my cousin.
 Well, she didn‚Äôt tell him that he was evil, just inadequate.
 And that after living with him, she decided that men weren‚Äôt for her.
 He never lived it down.
 Nobody in the family would let him live it down.
 We teased him all the time about it.
 Art ‚Äì Has he shot himself yet?
 Or someone else?
 Karen ‚Äì Not yet.

A coldly rational part of me knew that however this ended up playing out, I'd still have a test on Monday, and I'd still want to pass.
 It'd be nice sometimes to make the kind of dramatic gesture that you see on movies, or read about in books.
 Instead, I was sitting here with a stupid textbook while everything else inside of me hurt in a funny, cold kind of way.
 Like it hurt so much I could only feel the edges of the pain.
 Spanish followed Biology; then other subjects came and went until I felt like I'd made enough progress, or possibly wasted enough time.
 I collapsed into bed hours early and slept poorly.
 Sunday was about the same, only my insides felt even rawer under the calm surface.
 Like maybe they'd had something caustic poured on them.
 I woodenly went through the motions of studying, and then finally pushed all of my books to the side and opened up Les Mis√©rables.
 I tried to lose myself in the book, but the same worries that'd pestered me while I was trying to study continued to grate against the back of my mind.

In an essay on writing short stories, Andre Dubus advised that when we get stuck, instead of stopping or attempting to go forward, we should try going deeper.
 On this trip, I have attempted to deepen my understanding of the word ‚Äúadore.‚Äù Now I‚Äôm trying to do the same with some words in John‚Äôs admonition, because I feel my mind or the Spirit telling me that everything we need to know to live in goodness and beauty may be contained in those few lines.
 John tells us to ‚Äúbelieve in‚Äù the name of the Son.
 While at a glance this could be taken to mean we should simply believe that Jesus existed, it doesn‚Äôt.
 Because ‚Äúbelieve in‚Äù denotes more than credulity.
 ‚ÄúBelieve in‚Äù means to fully trust.
 And here we‚Äôre not called to believe in ‚ÄúHim‚Äù but to believe in His name.
 As ‚Äúname‚Äù in the Biblical context refers to character, John is calling us to fully trust in the character of Jesus Christ.
 When we believe in, fully trust certain people, if we have any sense, we will follow their example and not only take what advice they offer but actively seek every piece of wisdom we can wrest out of them.
 If I want to become a baseball star, I should look for a coach or mentor whose character and lessons I can believe in.

Thomas and I had fallen out because of his continued preference for drugs and that lifestyle and an inclination toward our biological father‚Äôs proclivity for untruths and big scams.
 The last thing I wanted was for Thomas to be a part of this.
 Oh, how he would rub my face in this shit.
 You would think with all my experience around drugs that I would have known what to do.
 That is exactly what I thought!
 Brandon was sickly and skinny.
 My wife lay with him for hours rubbing his back and keeping fluids in him.
 He went from cold to hot and back again.
 In a couple of weeks he was looking much healthier and we sent him out into the world again.
 Turns out, just because I did drugs and knew people who were addicted to drugs I was still not qualified to understand how to break someone from craving the drugs that satisfy their addiction.

"Whether that was his intent or not, the Sun didn't completely abandon him, either out of respect for what they'd shared, or possibly out of concern for her children.
 Once it became apparent that the Earth and Sun were through with each other, the Moon began to court her.
 Doomed to touch only briefly during the rare solar eclipses, they nevertheless became beloved, one to the other.
 The greatest sign of the Moon's devotion to the Sun came about when he sent his children down to the Earth to watch over and protect the sunborn, or dayborn as they are most often called."
 Alec's pause was long enough that I think I nodded off, but the sound of his voice once he resumed talking pulled me back awake.
 "Originally there were just two of the moonborn, a pair of brothers called Adjam and Inock.
 Unbeknown to the Moon, the Earth had anticipated his great gesture of love, and sent forth a plague upon the land.
 As Adjam, the elder of the brothers, descended from the heavens and touched down upon the Earth, he collapsed to the ground in pain.
 Despite his agony as the very bones of his body rearranged themselves, he managed to call out a warning to Inock, to flee back to the Moon.
 The love of Inock for Adjam was so great that he rushed to his brother's side, where he too fell victim to the Earth's plague."

She wanted to bury her face in the crook of his neck and shoulder.
 Did he like being kissed on the neck as much as she did?
 Just the memory of his kisses made her heart race.
 They had coffee and dessert in the living room.
 "What a pretty sculpture," Marie said, admiring a small porcelain garden filled with flowers and a water wheel.
 "Clap your hands," Teri told her.
 "What?"
 "Clap your hands."
 Marie did so, and music played as water began to make the water wheel turn.

The dreams were so clear and sharp they sometimes seemed more real than the rest of my life.
 By the time I finally realized what was keeping me from getting real sleep it was too late to worry about trying to get anymore rest.
 I just stared out my window at the light the previous owners had mounted on a pole.
 It was just close enough to see an amazingly thick cloud of insects swirl around it, captivated by the artificial glow.
 When I walked downstairs I found Mom's camping equipment piled in the living room.
 For all I'd tossed and turned, I must have gotten some sleep to have not heard her come in.
 I contemplated jotting down a note before just shrugging and skipping outside, happy for once to be shivering.
 It wouldn't last.
 Eventually the sun would clear the hills, and we'd be headed for eighty-plus degrees, but I could at least enjoy the next hour or so without worrying I was going to melt right out of my clothes.
 Walking down the lane, I tried to decide whether or not I wanted Brandon to show up today.

 "What?"
 "Washing my car."
 Her face fell.

 "No."

 He hadn't considered the fact that the water hose would be a new toy for her.

 Sparks rained down as he clanged his swords together.

 The tears in her eyes ran down her cheeks, not to be replaced by any more.
 ‚ÄúSo be it.‚Äù She took up her staff and held it defensively.

 Harruq obeyed.
 His insides churned as icy fingers pressed against his forehead.
 Images crackled through his mind.
 The entire world burned to ash and blew away on the wind.
 The painting revealed beneath was in fluid motion, an artwork of death and fire.
 He saw a city burning, people fleeing in the streets, and then he saw himself dressed in black armor that oozed power.
 Salvation and Condemnation waved high above his head, both drenched in blood.

Was it a difference in morals?
 Or times?
 Or was it Rick?
 She'd never known a man so warm and kind and open.
 Feeling a surge of affection, she slid her arms around his waist, laying her cheek against his back.
 "How does that feel?"
 "Better than you could ever imagine."
 He sucked in his breath, standing perfectly still.
 He didn't want to be released from her embrace.
 But moments later she pulled away from him.

Please don't think..." I felt tears start to gather at the corner of my eyes, but there wasn't any way to tell whether they were attributable to simple terror, acute embarrassment, or a combination of the two.
 Alec's arm was back, and he gently hugged me against his chest.
 "It was all just a dream, and you don't have anything to be sorry about.
 I don't mind you being here.
 I'm sorry I had to leave you alone for so long, it was inexcusable."
 I wanted to say something, wanted to tell Alec he didn't need to worry about me, that I'd spent enough time by myself lately to be happy with my own company, but the words wouldn't come out.
 The sheer pleasure at having him hold me so close was like a drug.
 I could feel the pleasant, tingly sensation I'd started associating with his touch, and it was like the best full-body massage, tied up with chocolate and reading a classic.
 Unaware of my mild state of euphoria, Alec continued on.
 "Actually, I owe you another apology.

The coming celebration had been the talk of speculation for months as well as the object of more than a little betting among the guards.
 Rodregas nodded, his thoughts swirling as he realized that he could use the celebration to his benefit.
 Without looking at the captain he walked toward the stairway, and the captain followed close behind him.
 At the door Rodregas took a deep breath and said, ‚ÄúCaptain, that ceremony did not go smoothly, but the gods once again proved to favor me, and I wish to be generous with the birthday ceremony.
 Tell the purser to pay everyone an extra month‚Äôs wages today and give everyone a week off to spend as they wish.
 Make sure you tell Purser Stevents to be generous.
 I want all staff rewarded, even the kitchen drudges.‚Äù He finished, hoping it did not sound as halting and made up as he knew it to be.
 ‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù replied Captain Poir, his expression going from a guarded concern to enthusiasm.
 He seemed reassured when Rodregas mentioned Stevents.
 He must have thought either Ravenhurr had been a bit damaged by the ritual or that the young man whose body he now inhabited might still be alive and faking it, obviously the young man would not know about Stevents.

But I am no prude, and we had our share of parties and events in Tahoe and at the waterbed store.
 When you put a bunch of twenty year olds and their friends in a retail store that has working hot tubs and waterbeds, things can quickly spiral out of control.
 We had no window coverings and our parties were in plain view of anyone who put their nose against the windows.
 It was a voyeurs‚Äô paradise and I am sure we entertained a lot of shocked window shoppers late into the night!
 Pete proved to be a bad choice of a business partner, as his use of cocaine escalated to the point of total addiction.
 In less than a year he would snort everything he could get his hands on.
 He was stealing money from the checking account and drop-shipping inventory from our business directly to drug dealers to feed his habit.
 My own brother Thomas was one of the many drug dealers receiving this merchandise for pennies on the dollar in exchange for cocaine and marijuana.
 This would be one of the many actions that would drive a wedge between Thomas and me as drugs and money started to always come before family.
 It hurt me deeply to contemplate Thomas‚Äôs complete disregard for our relationship as brothers and his choice to take this merchandise from my addicted partner while knowing full well that it would financially destroy my business and thus me.

Not that we talked to anyone, but they were aware of us, apparently.
 And, of course, there were binoculars trained on Lor, as she walked around in the nude.
 (laughs)  But, man, that was my only comfort, my woman, her body, her sweet, enveloping body.
 She suckled me like I was a child‚Äîshe has these breasts, well, sorry‚Äîanyway, we did a lot of fucking, you know, the kind you do until you cry yourself to sleep.
 We fucked in the cold water of the river which ran right below the cabin, standing up, man, cold as hell, I held her up and entered her right there, in front of God and everybody.
 It was heaven.
 It was hell.
 I was empty man, as empty as a skull.
 And Lor brought me back.
 Love.

"Treadmill?
 Exercise tape?"
 "You'll see."
 That night he showed her how to use the treadmill and how to work the VCR.
 He rented an exercise video and the two movies he'd mentioned, and Marie found herself looking forward to the next day.
 She was up at the crack of dawn, and after she got dressed, she was tempted to go walk on the treadmill before she woke Rick.
 Walking but never moving was an interesting experience.
 But the fog might not last long, and she had to get back today.
 But this time she didn't go charging headlong through the garden.
 She'd gotten here by strolling through it thinking about Davis.

Qurrah took out his last healing potion, popped the cork, and then held it before him.
 Blood was beginning to fill his throat once more.
 His stolen energy was quickly fading.
 He had no time to waste.
 He tilted his head as high as the arrow in his neck allowed, positioned the mouth of the vial against his lower lip, and then closed his hand around the arrow shaft.
 One last hissing breath.
 One tremble of his fingers.
 He yanked the arrow out.
 Sheer reflex kept him alive.
 His head shot backward and his arm went limp.

The problem in the more developed countries is that the demand for low-skilled jobs declines and the gap in wages between skilled and unskilled jobs tends to increase, resulting in a decline in incomes and employment opportunities for lower levels of the population in these countries.
 This is a natural, healthy process of social development in which different sectors serve as engines for growth at different stages.
 The upward job displacement that earlier shifted job opportunities from agriculture to industry now shifts them to higher-skilled jobs in manufacturing and services.
 The negative side-effects of this process on some sections of the population alert us to areas where society must make special efforts to speed their development.
 As in the case of technology, research is needed to document this complex process across industries, between countries and over time.
 One product of these studies could be the development of specific job coefficients measuring the impact of growth in trade in different industries on overall employment.
 Trade becomes of even greater potential benefit to industrial nations during the coming decade when economic growth in these countries is expected to be significantly slower than in the developing world.
 The pent-up demand generated by the destruction of Europe during the Second World War, the rapid expansion of population during the baby boom generation, and the explosion of new technologies in the past few decades, all generated strong internal demand in the OECD countries, resulting in steady economic growth.
 The slow growth of population and productivity in more recent years means that these factors cannot be expected to drive further economic expansion at the same rate.
 In contrast, average growth rates in developing countries are expected to be two to three times higher than in the industrial nations.

 Liz ‚Äì Ok.
 When are you going to break the news?
 Jim ‚Äì Later tonight I think, probably going to be me and dad doing it.
 I think I‚Äôll put it off as long as I can.
 Liz ‚Äì I think I would get it out of the way as quickly as possible.
 Jim ‚Äì On another day I might do that, but not today.
 I think I‚Äôll go and get something to eat first.
 Every condemned man should get a last meal before being executed.
 Liz ‚Äì That sounds like a good idea too.

While he is the odds on favorite to achieve it this year, no one wants him to win,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúI went and chatted with him,‚Äù she continued ‚Äúand he hates the Immortalists, but is rather unpleasant and needs to take a bath.
 But he is also clearly very honorable.
 And when I asked him why he wanted to be a knight‚Ä¶‚Äù she paused then added, ‚Äúhe said that some ‚ÄòInfernally damned knights‚Äô have to stand up and fight.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo you think he is a good man?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúI think Geriodon is a ‚Äòholier than thou‚Äô stick in the mud, who needs to learn to bathe and not mumble when he speaks.
 And yes, he is probably one of the only men here that actually deserves knighthood.‚Äù Rodregas nodded and said, ‚ÄúWhat about Nordien?‚Äù ‚ÄúNordien is the polar opposite to Geriodon; smooth and friendly‚Ä¶ and tried to have sex with me within our first conversation, which was also the only decent thing he said during our conversation.
 He seems to really dislike Geriodon and Karun.
 He comes from a strong blood line and rich family and feels he should already be a knight and not be forced to be in the tournament.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo, why is Nordien in the tournament and not knighted?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúFrom what I can gather, Nordien is very friendly with the Immortalists, including the Ambassador Van‚Äôdret, and most people believe that he only wants to be knighted so that he can then leave the knighthood and join the Immortal Guard.‚Äù Rodregas nodded.
 That was not too surprising; since such ex-knights are usually made officers.

(laughs)  Yeah, I did drugs.
 Ok, I wrote ‚ÄúBurn my Bridges‚Äù on speed, which is an angry drug, and it‚Äôs such an angry song.
 I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs not one of my favorites now, even though it‚Äôs newish.
 I wrote it one night‚ÄîI think Lor and I had had a fight,  a rare fight, and she had gone to a girlfriend‚Äôs house and I just thought, fuck it, I‚Äôm gonna do speed and stay up all night.
 I didn‚Äôt plan on writing.
 I thought, I‚Äôll just speed and watch late night TV‚Äîthere was some John Agar movie on‚ÄîYou dig John Agar?
 No?
 Don‚Äôt know him?
 Anyway, I was sitting there and there was a legal pad on the coffee table because earlier in the day I had tried writing a song about my mother‚Äîdon‚Äôt ask‚Äîand it was sitting there like an invitation and I was speeding like a hell-rooster, man, and I just picked up the pad and this big fat marker, I mean I was writing these huge thick letters on the  page (laughs) and I just started, ‚ÄúYou were mean to me/Leave me alone, let me sit in my tree/You were a snake, I needed you then/you were like bad heroin.‚Äù  And I ripped the whole thing off in about an hour.
 And I recorded it that night in my living room, fingers tearing over my strings till they bled, I was playing so hard, like Richie, and that song, that was recorded in my home‚Äîit sounds like it.

The smile was back, but it was more mischievous than before.
 "How about me knowing Britney left you high and dry after school today?"
 "Please.
 That just makes the humiliation more painful."
 Brandon shook his head as we pulled to a stop in front of my house.
 "No, that means I can do something about you losing your ride."
 I suddenly felt like there was a joke I was missing out on.
 "How do you propose to fix that?"
 "It was my fault so I'll be your ride back and forth from school every day."
 "I don't know about all of that, but thanks for the lift just now."

"Yeah--I wish I tanned that prettily."
 As she'd promised when she'd invited them, Teri had made a Chinese meal.
 "House rules: you have to spend at least 15 minutes using chopsticks," she told them as they sat down to dinner.
 "After that, you can have a fork if you want."
 Marie had eaten in Chinese restaurants in 1927, so she managed with the chopsticks.
 The meal was enjoyable, but she couldn't keep her thoughts from wandering to Rick.
 His neck looked so warm and inviting.
 She wanted to bury her face in the crook of his neck and shoulder.
 Did he like being kissed on the neck as much as she did?
 Just the memory of his kisses made her heart race.

As Rodregas passed they all mumbled the same words to him, ‚ÄúWelcome to the Order my brother.‚Äù Several reached out and shook his hand or showed other signs of welcome.
 Others, though, looked at him strangely, clearly put off by the way he had won the melee.
 He felt a little unsteady, not sure what to make of both the welcome and the uncomfortable looks.
 As he passed through the doors in the main hearing chamber, the Grand Marshal stood at the far end waiting.
 In the chamber were both knights and squires.
 Many smiled; he thought a few looked like the ones in the hall, not sure what to think of this new knight.
 Rodregas was not surprised that when he started to kneel in front of the Grand Marshal, for Van‚Äôdret to step forward and speak.
 ‚ÄúGrand Marshal, you are not really thinking of knighting this fiend, are you?
 He killed a fellow squire out there.
 And he consorts with Nymphs and Infernals, not people of the Celestial Realm.

Imeralda then proceeded to eat the acorn shaped fruit; it took some work.
 It seemed to be a bit harder than any ripe fruit Rodregas knew of, but he followed her example and found that while it was tart it was amazing.
 It tasted of... Rodregas did not know what to call the flavor; the words that came to mind were sunlight and rain and the smell of a forest at night.
 When Rodregas finished the fruit completely he felt more whole but was also sad that it was gone.
 Imeralda seemed in great humor.
 ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù she said.
 She dropped to her hands on the edge of the branch and then dropped down as if she was only feet from the ground which, strangely she was.
 Rodregas saw her standing on the ground.
 It was not that she had floated down.
 It was as if she had she had been in a regular sized tree.

Anger swelled in me.
 I wasn‚Äôt sure if I had given it to Chevelle because I‚Äôd trusted him, or because he was my captor, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling of betrayal.
 I couldn‚Äôt fathom why he would be giving my family heirloom to this woman.
 The ruby had been in the vault with my mother‚Äôs possessions, along with the map that had brought us here, and now he was giving this Ruby my ruby.
 I shook my head; there must be a connection, some reason it would end here.
 Ruby drew a package from her cape and handed it to Chevelle, smiling a temptress‚Äôs smile.
 It was about two hands in size, wrapped in light brown cloth.
 He slid it under his cloak and it disappeared from my view.
 I couldn‚Äôt imagine what she had given him, but it must have been in trade for my stone.
 As I peered through the gap in the doorframe, the stranger‚Äôs eyes flicked to mine and I was sure she somehow saw me.

I stole a glance at him out of the corner of my eye.
 He didn't look threatening, well, at least no more so than usual.
 Anyone with that many muscles was at least a little threatening.
 But he was just sitting there casually, driving along, seemingly without a care in the world.
 In fact, he wasn't buckled in either.
 "Isn't that a bit hypocritical?
 I mean you tell her to buckle up, but you're not buckled up yourself."
 Alec shrugged.
 "Yes, I suppose it does look hypocritical at that.
 Let's just say Rachel would be missed if we hit another car, but nobody would need to miss me."

It‚Äôs totally debilitating, man.
 Nausea can unseat you, can defeat the strongest man.
 And it‚Äôs a nausea that is in your blood‚Äîyour whole body is sick.
 And, you know, looking at it now, I think I was sick like the country was sick.
 I was nauseated for the USA, you dig?
 I took those deaths, that ignominious war, the whole queasy zeitgeist of the times and internalized them.
 And I couldn‚Äôt get away, not in a cabin, not in my music, not anywhere, man, because the enemy was me.
 And, dad, anyone who‚Äôs ever had that kind of stomach failure, where you feel like your whole system is shutting down on you, knows how bone-deep that kind of pain and fear is.
 This is when I started shooting horse.
 I‚Äôm not proud of it.

I never pictured it this way; I thought I would die a little more heroically, not screaming like a little girl.
 ‚ÄúNot now Seth,‚Äù Emily screamed at him.
 ‚ÄúEveryone think!‚Äù ‚ÄúHow can I think,‚Äù I screeched back, ‚Äúwhen the ground is rushed towards me at full speed?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know Jazell, just think if you want to live,‚Äù she said quickly.
 I let out another scream as my body tipped towards the edge of the dragon.
 I felt someone wrap their arm around me and I gave a grunt as I was pulled upright.
 Seth held me, his arm stiff and somewhat uncomfortable.
 I was frozen in fear, realizing that I hated falling.
 This was worse than my fear of rollercoasters.
 ‚ÄúCalm down,‚Äù Seth said to me.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to fall-‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, Seth?‚Äù I said in a panicked voice.

She trusted him not to hurt her, to do what was best for her.
 Groaning, he rolled off her.
 Marie immediately pushed herself up and over to lie on top of him, her mouth claiming his again.
 He couldn't help returning her kiss, but when she began kissing his neck, he croaked, "Sweetheart, please stop."
 She paused for just a second.
 But then she ran her hand over his chest, nibbling on his earlobe as she whispered, "I don't think I can."
 He groaned again.
 It had taken all the strength he had to make himself stop.
 If she kept kissing him, no power on earth, no amount of love or guilt would be able to make him stop.
 "Marie," he began, his voice cracking, "do you want to make love?"

I heard another crack and I slowly crept towards the noise.
 Another snap sounded, louder this time, to my left.
 I changed direction and hid behind a tree.
 I peeked around it.
 Seth grabbed another stick and slammed it into a tree.
 It hit the tree with a loud crack and broke in half.
 He picked up another and rammed it again.
 He went to grab another one but his fingers couldn‚Äôt grasp it.
 They shook so hard he dropped it and he sunk to the ground.
 I saw him place his head under his arms and he curled himself in a tight bundle.

"What?
 The commercial?
 It's an ad--an advertisement for soap."
 "An advertisement?
 People wear nothing but towels in advertisements?"
 "Afraid so.
 I guess we're used to it.
 Most people don't pay much attention to the commercials."
 If she was shocked by that commercial, he'd have to be careful about what movies he let her watch.
 She sat spellbound until 10:00, drinking in the commercials as well as the program.

It wasn't right for a girl to look at another girl like that.
 Like she couldn't wait to watch Vincent do all kinds of terrible things.
 "Payback sucks, doesn't it?"
 Jasmin's complete stillness was an eerie counterpoint to the waves of power still beating at me.
 I somehow knew she was just seconds away from springing when the sound of running footsteps caused all three to turn.
 Alec appeared around the corner, followed by Isaac, just a split second before Brandon sauntered into view from the opposite direction.
 The tingly feeling grew exponentially more powerful with so many more shape shifters present.
 Rubbing my arms did nothing to ward off the feeling that entire colonies of insects were skittering across my skin.
 Mr. Rindell's appearance forestalled what I'd been sure would turn into a full-blown fight.
 He sized up the situation with the canny eye of an educator who'd seen more fights over his career than most gang leaders.

The seconds dragged on and I began to wonder if I would die.
 And then it stopped.
 I sucked in a ragged breath, then another.
 I seemed fine, maybe a little dizzy, but otherwise it was gone.
 Unclenching my body, I looked around, expecting someone to be leaning over me, attempting to help.
 But nothing appeared out of place.
 I pushed up on shaky limbs.
 Chevelle was by the fire, preparing to roast the birds.
 Steed stood beside his horse, adjusting the saddle‚Äôs straps.
 Both had their backs turned to me as if they‚Äôd not even noticed.

It wasn't until I sat down at my desk and felt a wave of disappointment slither through me that I realized I'd been hoping to see Brandon in between classes.
 Mrs. Campbell caught me before I could leave for lunch.
 "Adriana, your homework is progressing along very well.
 At the risk of having you slow down, I'm going to admit that you're well ahead of where I'd hoped you'd be.
 Another couple of weeks and you'll be caught up and ready for your makeup test."
 I shrugged uncomfortably.
 When teachers praised me, it always made me feel like I was socially deficient.
 I didn't necessarily mind the fact that I spent hours more on homework than any of my peers, but being praised for it always felt like a backhanded insult.
 "It's okay, I'm not going to slack off.
 I want to be done with extra assignments as badly as you want to be finished with having to grade them."

As soon as we were out the front door, Alec motioned for me to jump on his back, and then we were off with a speed I suspected an Olympic athlete couldn't have matched.
 The lane between our house and the road flew by faster than I'd ever driven it in a car.
 The wind created by our passage was strong enough to make my eyes tear up, but I resisted the urge to close them.
 I occasionally saw shadowy shapes darting through the trees ahead or to either side of us, but there wasn't any way to be sure it was Isaac and Jasmin instead of Brandon and his entire pack.
 A faint howl from behind us caused Alec to put on another terrifying burst of speed as we left the lane and turned to parallel the road.
 The sight of branches clawing at us as we slipped by them with little more than inches to spare was too much.
 I finally closed my eyes and ducked down as close to Alec's neck as I could get.
 With one less sense distracting me, the rest of them kicked into high gear.
 I could feel every step, including the occasional slide as the rough gravel we were running on wasn't up to bearing our combined weight without slipping.
 The bitter taste of fear along the back of my tongue was surprisingly strong, but even so I found my thoughts dwelling on the sheer pleasure of having my arms wrapped around Alec's rock-hard upper body.

‚ÄúYou stay here.

 The shooting officers would be on the driver‚Äôs side firing over my head.
 (How comforting).
 What had I gotten myself into?
 I didn‚Äôt want brains splattered all over my truck, especially if they were mine!
 I was then shown pictures so I could verify Ashley and recognize Steve.
 It was her, and his head was practically shaved bald.
 He looked like your typical punk kid, just like Brandon.
 ‚ÄúIs his hair still that short?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúHmm.
 I‚Äôm not supposed to take you outside.
 Not supposed to leave you.‚Äù I stood, waiting.
 ‚ÄúFood,‚Äù she decided.
 She yanked two cloaks from the corner and tied them on, covering our heads, and led me to the wardrobe by her bed.
 I couldn‚Äôt imagine how we could get any more clothes on as she opened the door and started to throw them onto her bed.
 But she leaned out of the wardrobe door to whisper, ‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù She stepped into the cabinet, dragging me with her.
 We were standing outside the rear of her house.
 She slid the false wall back in place and grabbed my arm again, our heavy cloaks moving like shadows as we ran from the village.
 We didn‚Äôt go far before she stopped and jerked me into a squat beside her.

I could remember my dreams, the wind and fire surrounding my mother.
 But the memories that came back when I woke from those vivid nightmares were dull.
 The harder I clutched at them, the more they drew away.
 When recognition dawned, I leapt from the rock, cursing Chevelle.
 He turned to me as I yelled, ‚ÄúGive it back!‚Äù He didn‚Äôt appear to know what I was talking about, but I was so angry I was having trouble forming the demand.
 ‚ÄúGive my memories, my mind back!‚Äù His confusion cleared, but Chevelle didn‚Äôt offer a response.
 The fire in me itched to burn him.
 I seethed.
 ‚ÄúUnbind my thoughts.‚Äù ‚ÄúFreya.‚Äù His voice was smooth.
 ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù I fumed, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm sure that has nothing to do with you rummaging around in there.‚Äù He shook his head and his complete lack of agitation caused me to take pause.

 "Wait, you mean me?

The last time a tracker had found us.
 It was all I could do to steady myself as the councilman was brought forward, because he was the same one from my vision.
 I was in shock as he knelt, not under his own power, and was frozen there before us.
 How could I have seen him?
 Chevelle mumbled something and my ears began to ring, distracting me from bewilderment.
 It was only a few stuttered heartbeats before recognition came.
 ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù I hissed.
 All eyes turned to me, but I glared at Chevelle.

They drove us deep into a sugar cane plantation.
 We were not going to the police station.
 Pete and I sat in the back of this police car on our bound hands in silence.
 They eventually pulled us out of the car and beat the shit out of us.
 They undid our handcuffs when they were done, emptied our pockets of every dollar, and even took the pot we had.
 They left us in the field and all we knew to do was to walk back the way we came.
 We hitchhiked to the airport and stood outside where the planes were de-boarding.
 We hustled an unsuspecting tourist into buying our surfboards so we could return to California.
 I collect-called my mother from Waikiki once we knew what flight we would be on and she was surprised to hear my voice since we hadn‚Äôt talked in months.
 She picked us up at the airport and I think her head almost turned in a circle when she saw us.

What is this?
 I shook my head and continued.
 My stupid sister was mad because he didn‚Äôt let her help.
 She started to throw a tantrum and he stiffened her tongue.
 It was stuck like that for hours.
 I laughed so hard I kept having to wipe the tears from my eyes.
 She tried to yell at me and it came out, ‚ÄúThut uhp!
 Thop iht!‚Äù Which made me laugh harder, and she got so mad she screamed and busted a bunch of glass.
 I kept reading, enthralled.
 It seemed to be a journal, written by a girl, but I had no idea who.

He sat down beside her and did his best to focus on the letters.
 Aurelia seemed impressed enough with his progress, and they soon began working on simple words further into the book.
 ‚ÄúWhy does your brother speak so strangely,‚Äù she asked once they were done, trying to broach the subject casually.
 She sat stretched out on the grass, her legs crossed and her weight leaning back on her arms.
 The whole time they had taught she had found her mind wandering to the sick, spidery voice Qurrah spoke in, a voice that had nearly spoiled his otherwise surprising charm.
 ‚ÄúQurrah was sold to a necromancer.
 I told you that, right?‚Äù
 Aurelia nodded.
 ‚ÄúI believe you did.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWell, he caught my brother practicing a spell once.

 He grinned at her.

 He smiled at his parents.
 "Are you serious?"
 "Yes."
 He stroked her hair as he gazed down at her.

I encouraged the horse to run and he responded immediately, taking flight down the mountainside.
 The rocks streaked past us as we ran faster and faster, the wind whipping his mane.
 A great bird perched on the dead limb of an ironwood tree and I jumped to it just as it dropped from the branch and flared its wings out to catch the wind.
 We flew still farther as I watched the mountain pass below.
 There was a scrubby patch of trees ahead and I could see movement there, inside.
 I tried to focus on it‚Ä¶ familiar silver and white.
 Commotion brought me back and I sat up, startled.
 My head spun.
 Ruby caught my arm to steady me.
 Her smile was strained as she handed me a drink of water.

He curled up at the blow, crying out in pain.
 Guess not, she thought.
 A shove put him on his back.
 He pleaded to her, sputtering blood, but she ignored him.
 ‚ÄúSome people should not reproduce,‚Äù she said.
 Down came her staff, all her might behind it.
 The end smashed his genitals, eliciting a cry of pain beyond anything her spells could do.
 She continued to strike, punctuating every word with another blow.
 ‚ÄúSo, let, me, fix, that, for, you!‚Äù
 She stopped when he passed out from the pain.

Several ideas will be of abiding value in our endeavour to make the most of this rare moment.
 Our present problems and future potentials can only be understood when viewed from a wider historical perspective that avoids getting lost in the media-driven drama and intensity of momentary crisis and short-term trends.
 As recent global action to protect the environment amply demonstrates, public awareness and understanding are growing too rapidly and becoming too important in global affairs for us to rely on the present positions of governments or current public sentiment as gauges of what may be achieved in the near future.
 More reliable indices of what is possible are the underlying currents that are rapidly raising the value of the human being, bringing nations together in ever-closer co-operation and mutual interdependence, and pressing the international community to raise its goals.
 The world is blind to the measure of its own accomplishments.
 We need fully to recognize the astonishing magnitude of the achievements of the present century and fully to understand the process that made them possible.
 This process expresses itself as scientific, technological, commercial, political, economic, social and cultural development.
 But its driving force is social and psychological.
 Its prime mover is human beings.
 Becoming conscious of the process of society‚Äôs past achievements is a key to more rapid future progress.

She held out the ring.
 He ignored it.
 "You're just confused because of what happened to you.
 What did happen to you, by the way?"
 "I came to my senses.
 Take your ring, Davis."
 "Listen, Marie, you don't know what you're saying.
 We can push the date back a bit, get married in October instead of September."
 "What part of `I don't want to marry you' do you not understand?"
 She grinned, because he was obviously taken aback.

He started walking over toward where he had left Doi‚Äôvan, and this time he got to see the result of taking on a greater sigil as the dragon reared up.
 All three heads roared and the wings started to beat and the dragon seemed to actually fly for a second.
 For just a brief moment there were two daemon dragons.
 Then one of them fell toward the ground only to sink into the shape of Doi‚Äôvan.
 Doi‚Äôvan staggered and Rodregas reached out and caught him to keep him from falling.
 Apparently, being a three headed daemon dragon did not include a cat-like ability to land from a fall.
 Rodregas steadied him and then Doi‚Äôvan shook himself and looked around, confused.
 ‚ÄúAre you all right?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 Doi‚Äôvan nodded and then said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get out of the chamber.‚Äù Rodregas nodded, as he wanted to check on Imeralda.
 Doi‚Äôvan seemed to have his balance back.

I stood, helpless, as Chevelle spoke up.
 ‚ÄúElfreda.‚Äù He‚Äôd used my given name, I hoped simply because we were in a formal setting and not because of whatever horrible thing I had been accused of.
 He was pleading now.
 ‚ÄúWhere did you learn how to fuse the pendant with your blood?‚Äù Fuse the pendant with my blood?
 What was he talking about?
 I heard someone behind me.
 ‚Äú‚Ä¶ how did she know to keep it from being removed?‚Äù And someone else.
 ‚Äú‚Ä¶ who even left it with her?‚Äù It came together then, the feeling I‚Äôd had when I woke and placed it around my neck, the part of the dream I‚Äôd shaken off as I stood before the basin washing up, cleaning the blood from my hands, from the pendant.
 I wanted to explain, tell of what I‚Äôd seen in the dream, but it was foggy and I was too slow to pull it into thought.
 I was too late; they had already passed judgment on me.

 He opened his eyes and stopped breathing.
 Marie emerged from the fog and started running toward him.

 She leapt into his arms, laughing and crying.

 He buried his face in her hair, tears spilling into it.
 She began covering his face with kisses.

Of course not!
 How can you even think that?"
 She stared at him in shock.

 "So you stopped kissing me because you didn't want to-to .

 A woman was coming out of one house, wearing very short blue trousers, and Marie ran in the other direction.

What is this destiny?‚Äù The dwarf gave a feeble smile.
 ‚ÄúAll of you must free our world from darkness, from him.‚Äù *** Seth and I walked back to our clearing, both our brains not thinking.
 It was too much to take in at once.
 Destroy Kojas?
 We could barely take on a mass of monsters without dying, so how were we suppose to take down an evil, powerful demon?
 As the trees parted away to show the empty ground, I spotted Emily and Jason looking like they were about to go to war with a bunch of sticks.
 When they saw us appear, both dropped their weapons and smiled at us.
 Typical cover up.
 ‚ÄúHey Seth, it looks like Jazell didn‚Äôt kill you after all,‚Äù Emily said and flashed me a grin.
 ‚ÄúWhat was that all about anyway, Jazell?‚Äù I opened my mouth to spill the whole truth when Seth glanced at me.

Emily propped herself up on her elbow.
 ‚ÄúHi, what are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúAn augothas.‚Äù it replied and fluttered its wings.
 ‚ÄúAre you a half-ling?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, how did you know?
 Is it that obvious?‚Äù The augothas seemed to cock its head.
 ‚ÄúWell you can't be a faery because you don't have the ears and you can't be a pixie because they're always giggling around.
 How can you understand me?‚Äù Emily shrugged.
 ‚ÄúI don't know, it's this new power I have.
 My friend has one too.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat sounds like the other one.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù she asked.
 The augothas uncurled its tail and took off in the air.
 ‚ÄúI must go, friend.

One of these things was the expensive camera we had given him for Christmas.
 It was at the pawnshop.
 Agenda Item Two: Retrieve valuables from the pawnshop.
 The camera was sitting at a local pawnshop as collateral on a loan that expired on the very day we got there for it.
 It was the first time I had ever stepped foot in a pawnshop; it was a shit hole covered with other people‚Äôs Christmas and birthday presents.
 It was humiliating for me to be in this place and my son could not look me in the eyes the entire time we were there.
 The walls were lined with guitars, the glass counters held cameras, jewelry and trinkets of all types.
 The floors and shelves were covered with tools and equipment.
 The stuff was busting out of the place.
 The people who ran it were the lowest form of life, preying on the weak, broke and addicted.

"If you're really that enthralled by a college physics book, you're more than welcome to take it home with you tonight.
 Just promise to bring it back in the same condition.
 Remember, I'm less concerned with your answer, and more interested in the process you take to try and solve the problem.
 Of course the right answer never hurts."
 I smiled and hurried out of class with a 'thank you'.
 I shouldn't have bothered rushing.
 I slipped into Spanish exactly three seconds before the late bell sounded, but Mrs. Tiggs wasn't even there.
 When she finally did show up, we had a surprise quiz on our vocabulary.
 Once we finished she turned on the television and told us to listen for conjugation.
 I almost wished I shared the class with Britney, her dad seemed like the type to get six kinds of riled up over something like that.

We contemplated the worst as we watched what was our son, our first-born, drive off into complete uncertainty.
 We didn‚Äôt know Brandon at all, and we really believed we might never see him again.
 On the day of his birth which seemed like yesterday, I had watched as his little body took its first breath and now I felt like I might be watching him take his last.
 We chose not to tell any of my wife‚Äôs family because we were quite frankly, embarrassed.
 My wife‚Äôs family was similar to the 1950s TV Cleavers, and we didn‚Äôt think they would understand, so for now it remained a family secret.
 I selfishly didn‚Äôt want their advice or opinions because I didn‚Äôt expect them to ever understand.
 In their defense, they grew up in such a pure family environment that they were ill prepared for the drama that surrounded my upbringing.
 I have come to understand their view of me as a shady character, and the unlikely marriage of my kind to their perfect daughter, and I have accepted the fact that my past was a freak show compared to their lives.
 Now I had a contemporary freak-drama in my home, and didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd be much help with it.
 My family on the other hand, was pre-disastered.

In some ways he was adding another burden and it was heavy.
 ‚ÄúArise, Sir Rodregas, Knight of the Soaring Heavens and be made welcome in the Cathedral of the Heavens.‚Äù Applause filled the room, though it was muted.
 Rodregas looked for Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda and he was sad to see that they had not been there to share his moment.
 Van‚Äôdret at least had left.
 The next few hours went by quickly.
 He was introduced to many people.
 It was late as the other knights went to find sleep when both Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda suddenly both appeared.
 He could see from their body language that they were ready to do more than congratulate him.
 CHAPTER 15 DARK SHADOWS
 Doi‚Äôvan led the three deeper into the great cathedral and said, ‚ÄúSir Rodregas, congratulations are in order for becoming a Knight of the Soaring Heavens, but I fear Van‚Äôdret is getting suspicious.

The secretary took in the two of us, frowned almost imperceptibly at the length of the shorts and then signed a form for the other girl.
 Determined to at least try and make friends, I started to smile as she turned towards me on her way out, but the expression died as soon as I met her flat green eyes.
 My heart immediately started to race, but she was already gone, moving with grace and confidence out of the suddenly too-small office.
 I'd expected some degree of cliquishness from such a small-town, but this was bad.
 I'd never seen her before, so there wasn't any way it could be some kind of misunderstanding.
 The secretary smoothed her blouse down over an ample stomach and smiled at me.
 I told myself I was just imagining that the smile never reached her eyes.
 She seemed to know who I was, and after identifying herself as Mrs. Pendely, proceeded to quiz me about which classes I'd been in at my last school.
 She stumbled a bit when I told her I hadn't enrolled in classes before moving.
 I didn't offer any additional information, so she tried to defuse the awkwardness by asking about electives.

They discussed Junnie and Anvil and Fannie, but those all felt like two sets of people now.
 They were worried; I could hear the stress in their tones.
 How long had I been like this?
 It seemed so long, trapped here.

 I tried to feel my arms, see if they were still there.
 Was that why I couldn‚Äôt move?
 Was I still tied to a wall?
 No, no, I wasn‚Äôt tied.

On the Road
 Probably all of us high school seniors worried about the reality that soon we would be on our own, sent out to face a rather scary world.
 For a while, that was Eric‚Äôs obsession.
 The atom bomb threat had recently gotten re-stoked when Khrushchev and Kennedy held a stare-down to decide who could launch nuclear missiles from the western hemisphere and who couldn‚Äôt.
 At a coffeehouse near the college I would attend, we overheard people talking about Jack Kerouac and the Beat generation, which Kerouac described as all of us who grew up after Hiroshima and consequently understood just how fragile and tentative life was.
 The end of the world was a recurrent theme of these writers who got called the Beats.
 Any second some madman or tyrant could push the button.
 Kapow, our race is a goner.
 See that coming and, walloped by dread reality, spooked beyond reach of old customs and authority, our nature cries, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs out there somewhere, whatever it is.
 Go find it.‚Äù Eric and I bought Kerouac‚Äôs On the Road, and checked out Dharma Bums and his latest, Big Sur, a memoir in minimal disguise, about a fellow who goes to a cabin in the forest to recover from drunkenness and fame.

He'd been polite, but hadn't tried to fawn over me.
 My being asked out had changed my treatment from almost every girl at school.
 Half the student body, the more sensible portion it seemed, had all decided that I was some kind of massively stuck-up slut.
 The other half had decided they needed to be my new best friend if they wanted to get invited to any of the cool parties ever again.
 It might not have bothered me except the girls who now hated me were the ones I generally would've gotten along with, at least as much as I ever got along with anyone.
 My leaving Brandon's insane bouquet of flowers at the office instead of lugging it around all day should have helped.
 Apparently they all either thought it was a ploy, or were just too stupid to get the message that I didn't want to jump on the popularity bandwagon.
 Whatever the reason, I'd gotten three invitations to assorted parties or other activities before school ended.
 I even got another two as I hobbled back from the office with my roses, which had decreased during their stay there by exactly the number of office ladies.
 I'd politely declined each invitation, citing my need to catch up in Biology and Spanish, and made it to tutoring without further mishap.

You appeared to be an Immortalist Sorcerer and I have grown to hate the Immortalists.
 When it became clear that you were not, I stopped trying to kill you.‚Äù He paused at this, and then Rodregas could tell he made a decision.
 ‚ÄúYou have given me a sword, if a small one, and among my people that is a powerful gesture.
 I will not lie to you, I have left my old life behind and the last few years I have learned to truly hate the Immortalists.
 I travel with you only because the others were going to go back to their homes, and I have no home to go back to,‚Äù he seemed to finish, but then added, ‚ÄúLast night you pointed out that the forces of the Immortalists would be after you and you would fight them.
 And you also proved that you can fight.‚Äù Once again he paused.
 He was clearly a man that liked to think before he spoke.
 ‚ÄúI am simply using you as bait.
 When they come for you, I will kill them.
 Fighting together we will kill some of their vaulted Immortal Guards.‚Äù As Doi‚Äôvan finished he gave a low growl and shook his horned head, his thick mane of wild jet black hair was almost as distinctive as Imeralda‚Äôs own auburn flowing locks.

Harruq viciously plucked blades of grass.
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù
 Aurelia stared at Harruq for a while, her eyes probing.
 The half-orc endured the gaze, concentrating fully on his grass-removing project.
 ‚ÄúI would feel better having met your brother,‚Äù she said at last.
 ‚ÄúBut you may take as long as you wish.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúGood.
 Can we spar now?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Aurelia said, picking up her staff.

"The other school of thought is that I'm more of a healer than anyone realized, and that I couldn't resist your obvious need."
 He'd lost me there.
 "Wait, what do you mean?"
 Alec paused for several seconds before answering.
 "You glow.
 All of the time.
 Until now we always thought someone had to be a shape shifter to do that."
 "But I'm just a normal person.
 Why would I appear different than anyone else?"
 Alec's shrug was enough to send my heart racing again, but not enough to distract me from his words.

He looked pleased.
 ‚ÄúAgain,‚Äù he said as he stepped back and released my hands.
 The meadow seemed to open as a circle of fire grew in front of me.
 I tried to see past it, through the flames to Chevelle, and then it was gone.
 He was further back now, raising his right hand so a stream of fire followed it, arcing in my direction.
 I was afraid I wouldn‚Äôt be able to extinguish it before it hit me.
 My feet were frozen in place.
 I could only think of one thing: Fight fire with fire.
 I flung my arm toward the incoming stream of flames and a tongue of fire akin to a dragon‚Äôs shot out and collided with it.
 I was shocked.

I closed the door, locking it behind me and then dialed Emily‚Äôs cell phone as fast as I could.
 I sat on my bed as the phone rang three times before I heard it click.
 ‚ÄúJazell you wouldn‚Äôt believe what my parents just told me.
 They say I signed up for some camp and-‚Äù ‚ÄúI know the same thing happened to me,‚Äù I interrupted her quickly.
 I hear her breathe heavily, ‚ÄúThis is crazy, it‚Äôs just happening too fast.
 We have to go or we‚Äôll be in big trouble with our parents.
 But the thing is we don‚Äôt know where this meeting place is and-‚Äù She was cut off by the ringing of my phone.
 ‚ÄúWait a minute Emily, I‚Äôll have to put you on hold.‚Äù She huffed in reply so I pressed a button and said, ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me, Jazell,‚Äù Jason‚Äôs voice said breathlessly.
 ‚ÄúI know where the meeting place is.‚Äù ‚ÄúGreat Jason, where is it?‚Äù I asked.
 A shuffle of paper sounded as Jason moved around.

As he opened his eyes he was also alarmed to see Captain Poir looking down at him with a confused and worried expression.
 Captain Poir said, ‚ÄúMaster Ravenhurr?‚Äù It was a question.
 Rodregas wondered why his captain would think he was the Master.
 And then suddenly it all rushed back to him, all the details of the final ceremony.
 ‚ÄúOh my gods he had burned!‚Äù Rodregas thought in alarm.
 He quickly raised his hand to his eyes, but instead of his scarred, wrinkled hand that should have been seared by burns; there was a powerful smooth hand.
 Rodregas reached up and touched his face.
 ‚ÄúDear Gods,‚Äù he thought in amazement, ‚Äúthe trigger words had worked.‚Äù He had done what he had learned to despise and hate most of all; he had switched into the body of an innocent man.
 ‚ÄúI am an Immortalist,‚Äù thought Rodregas in dismay.
 It had been his only shot at survival, and the young man had already been dead in all ways that mattered, but still it was an act of incredible repugnance to him.

Still he kept at it, though there seemed to be nothing else of wealth in the room.
 He was determined to see the evil books burn.
 They held the secrets to the Immortalist art and other dark magic.
 Leaving them would only lead to another person rising in Ravenhurr‚Äôs place.
 Several of the foulest books seemed to refuse to burn but the flames eventually consumed all, just as they had consumed Ravenhurr.
 Finally, the last of the dark books of magic were burned, and the few remaining books that felt of magic but lacked the evil stench of the others were packed in the trunk.
 Only six volumes had been free of the stench, while over forty were burned.
 The sun was now streaming into the room and he was feeling the lack of sleep.
 He decided that it would take a while for the keep to empty out as everyone went into town to ‚Äòcelebrate‚Äô Ravenhurr‚Äôs new birthday, and he stretched out on the big four-poster bed.
 He had thought that he would struggle to sleep, but instead immediately found deep sleep.

My ears rang.
 I must have been speaking or cursing.
 I could hear the sound, but could not make sense of it.
 Nothing made sense.
 I was standing before I knew I was surrounded.
 Fury and fire swam in my head, my chest, my hands.
 I heard them through the buzz.
 ‚ÄúFrey, what‚Äôs wrong?
 What is it?
 Frey‚Ä¶ Frey.‚Äù And then, clearer, ‚ÄúElfreda!‚Äù My jaw tightened, my teeth ground together.

But there was more to her beauty than that incredible face and body.
 She was .

 fun-loving and vibrant, just as the article had said.
 The thought of the article sobered him.
 He loved being with Marie, but he had to remember that she was going back to 1927.
 The closer he felt to her, the more he‚Äôd miss her when she was gone.
 "I like this one best."
 Marie had emerged from the dressing room carrying the black and pink suit.

 He chuckled, dropping another kiss on her neck.

It's essentially the motto of two entire generations now.
 Make them tell you exactly how much they know before you admit to anything, and then only admit to the parts they already know about.
 It's a crappy way to run a society, but I'm just one kid.
 I can't be blamed for just trying to keep my head down and survive.
 We were already pulling into the parking lot.
 He must have been driving even faster than normal.
 That should have triggered another panic attack, but the tension in the black Mustang was high enough to distract my subconscious for now.
 Brandon smoothly pulled the bulky car in between a pair of SUVs and cut the engine before turning and hitting me with the full force of his gray eyes.
 "Adriana, I promised to protect you.
 I know it's kind of anachronistic, but I take those kinds of promises seriously.

She'd covered her face with her hands and was sobbing.
 How had this happened?
 What had actually happened?
 Was she losing her mind?
 Was this some fantastic hoax?
 Everything was so strange.
 How was she ever going to get home?
 Rick put his key in the ignition but then turned to look helplessly at the terrified girl.
 "It'll be all right, Marie."
 He leaned over to hug her.

Both turned to see Ahrqur standing at the top step, his arms crossed.
 He was dressed in a long green robe.
 Silver swirls marked the sleeves and front.
 Brown hair fell far past his shoulders.
 ‚ÄúPleased to meet you,‚Äù Harruq said with a bow.
 ‚ÄúIndeed,‚Äù Qurrah said, his hand itching to retrieve his whip curled underneath his raggedy robe.
 ‚ÄúIf you are thieves, you are certainly incompetent ones,‚Äù Ahrqur said, his voice full of contempt.
 He descended halfway down the stairs, his eyes never leaving the two.
 ‚ÄúOf course, what could one expect from Celestia‚Äôs cursed?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWe are not thieves, Ahrqur Tun‚Äôdel,‚Äù Qurrah said.

By the time I reached the door I was contemplating just finding a decent tree and spending the afternoon outside.
 The sight of a white envelope, barely visible against the off-white door, was enough to drive those thoughts out of my head.
 It had my name on the side that'd been facing the door.
 I pulled it down as I walked inside the house.
 Mom was gone, there wasn't any reason I couldn't read whatever was in the envelope in the living room, but I found myself quickly climbing up our creaky stairs and closing my bedroom door behind me.
 I tore the envelope open and pulled out a piece of heavy paper, almost like parchment.
 The writing was elegant, a kind of flowing script that was different from anything I'd ever seen, but which paled against the sheer artistry of the sigil positioned at the bottom of the note.
 Adriana, Your words of thanks were altogether unexpected, but decidedly appreciated.
 You're most welcome for whatever small part I might have played in helping events to unfold as they would have in a perfect world.
 My actions were not such as to merit any large boon from you, but still I must ask one.

He took that as an invitation, leaning closer, his hand raised to touch my face.
 His thumb caressed the line of my jaw as he reached around, fingers tangling in my braids as he drew me to him.
 He started gently, teasing, and then crushed our lips together, his strong hand holding me there, his breathing ragged.
 At some point, I became aware of what I was doing.
 I drew back.
 ‚ÄúI have to go now.‚Äù He looked devastated.
 ‚ÄúGoodbye, young Noble.‚Äù ‚ÄúCan I see you again?‚Äù I smiled.
 ‚ÄúI will return.‚Äù He took a deep breath, satisfied.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be waiting.‚Äù As I turned to go, I realized I hadn‚Äôt asked any of the important questions that had been nagging me.
 I‚Äôd have to try harder tomorrow, stay on task.

"You wish what?"
 When she didn't respond, he tilted her chin up, making her look into his eyes.
 "Stay here, Marie.

 We'll have a wedding night more exciting than anything you could imagine."
 Her breath caught, and tears filled her eyes.
 "I-I can't, Rick.
 I have to go home."
 She squeezed his hand.
 "My home, my family, everything I know is in 1927.

Rodregas‚Äô eyes fell on a man who sat in a beautiful carved chair, a match for the table that sat just behind the knights.
 He was tall and graceful with striking dark eyes and features.
 His long dark hair was pulled back.
 He wore not the clothing of the knights but the robes of an Immortalist Sorcerer.
 Across his chest was a sash.
 Rodregas guessed him to be the Guild‚Äôs Ambassador to the Knights.
 Rodregas‚Äô blood froze at the sight, though he did his best to remain casual.
 He knew that the Guild had a representative at the Cathedral but had not expected him to be so closely watching the registration table.
 Rodregas fell into old habits of survival.
 He kept his eyes to himself and let himself feel the tiredness of travel on the road.

In fact, that part was the truth!
 He was then supposed to tell Steve that he needed help supplying one of his regulars while his parents were holding him with a tight leash and ask him if he could do it.
 All Brandon was asking for in return for this connection was a few Oxy pills dropped at our house as a referral fee.
 Brandon asked Steve to just put the pills on his windowsill so he could get high unbeknownst to his parents.
 The intention was to make Steve believe that Brandon was still using, and thus trustworthy.
 Brandon was a nervous wreck.
 He was completely confused after days of detox and scared to death that he was going to prison if the scheme failed.
 Brandon contacted the other drug dealer from his own cell phone so Steve would recognize the number.
 Brandon told Steve the concocted story and then supplied Steve with the phone number that Officer White had given him for the phony buyer.
 Immediately there was trouble: The officer had accidentally given Brandon the same phone number that Steve already possessed; the same number that had been given to Steve by the same officers for his use when he was setting up a bust of his own.

Emily was running over with Jason on her heels.
 She slowed down and hugged me tight.
 Jason slapped Seth on the back and bent over to catch his breath.
 ‚ÄúHey, where were you guys?‚Äù I asked.
 ‚ÄúWe were looking around to see if it was safe,‚Äù Emily said.
 ‚ÄúWe thought you two were doing the same.‚Äù She put her hands on her hips.
 ‚ÄúI guess not.‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you going to get mad at me?‚Äù I pouted.
 She play punched me in the arm.
 ‚ÄúNo, I'll let it slide.‚Äù She winked at me.
 I looked over at Seth, trying to catch his eye but he avoided my gaze.

Velixar whirled, his speed far beyond any mortal.
 He stepped past Felewen‚Äôs slash and slammed a hand against her chest.
 Dark magic poured in.
 Her arms and legs arched backward, her sword fell from her hand, and her mouth opened in a single, aching shriek.
 Bits of darkness flared from her mouth, her eyes, and her nostrils.
 Done, Velixar shoved her smoking body back into the alley and left her to die.
 When he turned, he snarled.
 Aurelia was gone.
 ‚ÄúYou have delayed me my kill,‚Äù he said to Felewen‚Äôs body.
 ‚ÄúPray you are dead before I return.‚Äù

He will bring us to victory, the half-ling boy!‚Äù The crowd roared louder than ever, fueled by the thought of victory.
 Anger rose inside me with every word Kojas said.
 Seth would not help them and the dwarf didn't make a mistake.
 The only one making the mistake was Kojas.
 The crowd fell silent as he said, ‚ÄúWe will find them and kill them.
 Than nothing will be in our way!‚Äù My disbelief grew and a single howl sounded above all.
 I felt the ground disappear underneath me as I woke up to the safety of the cave.
 I opened my eyes and had to squint because the light was so strong.
 I sat up and leaned against the wall, looking around.
 The sun shone brightly through the cave's entrance, making dirt particles appear in the air.

I called the jail and received minimal information beyond his bail amount.
 We opted to leave Brandon in jail.
 He was released 23 hours later on his own recognizance.
 Brandon spent the days after his release from jail back at our home as we attempted the daunting task of detoxing him.
 Through withdrawals again!
 Brandon became sicker every day that his frail body went without the Oxy it craved to survive.
 Brandon had lived away from our house for over a year and he looked like a ghost of himself.
 His eyes were dark, his enthusiastic personality was gone and his mind seemed permanently altered.
 He was 23 years old, 6‚Äô 2‚Äù and his weight was hovering at a skeletal 130 pounds.
 We had Brandon on complete lockdown at our house with no visitors allowed, searching his room and the entire house daily.

The liberalization of domestic policies for this sector is also needed in developing countries where government controls and populist policies have often retarded growth of agriculture.
 However, the timing and extent of these measures should be dictated by the relative strengths and needs of each particular country, not by strict adherence to any economic doctrine.
 Role of Government
 Agricultural subsidies and protection are subsets of a larger issue ‚Äì the role of government in agricultural development.
 The experience of the past four decades strongly supports the view that government can play a vital role in stimulating agriculture up to the stage where the rural economy demonstrates the dynamism needed to take off on its own.
 Although the Green Revolution has been widely heralded as an achievement of modern technology, the hybrid seeds and chemical-based cultivation practices that formed the technological basis for the breakthrough in foodgrain production constitute only one part of a comprehensive, integrated development strategy in which government played a central and crucial role.
 This strategy included massive, country-wide demonstration programmes to introduce farmers to new technology, the establishment of new public sector agencies for rapid multiplication and distribution of seeds, assured markets and guaranteed floor prices for foodgrains to eliminate fear that higher production would result in crashing prices, construction of additional storage capacity to house the increased production, import or manufacture of fertilizers, and, most importantly, for transport, distribution and marketing of surplus grains in food deficit areas.
 Few developing countries ‚Äì perhaps few countries at any stage of development ‚Äì could have marshalled resources on such a massive scale and instituted such widespread changes so rapidly without heavy reliance on the government for both planning and execution.
 In the majority of developing countries, government is still the most organized and efficient agency and the only one capable of such significant initiative.
 In formulating strategies, it is essential to take fully into account both the stages and steps of the development process.

I felt guilty that I couldn‚Äôt say something to my younger son Bryce but he was now back at college and we hadn‚Äôt told him what I was doing for Brandon.
 I didn‚Äôt want him to worry and I didn‚Äôt want him to hate his brother for putting me in this situation.
 I would tell him later when all was well .
 .
 .
 hopefully.
 If not, I needed to tell my wife to tell him how much I loved him, just in case.
 She broke down and I left the house before she had recomposed herself.
 I received my first instructions at the police station.
 Told to follow two undercover cars to the back of a nearby hotel, we were met by about a dozen different police officers in varying attire.

A day since Kojas took him.
 I had told him, when he had first said that Kojas wanted to use him that he didn‚Äôt have to worry.
 I should have known that Kojas would do anything to get him, and now Seth was gone.
 After he had been taken and Jason had awakened, the faery jerks had scattered.
 Then a light pixie had showed up, the same one who had saved my life a while ago, and led us all the way to her majesty‚Äôs place.
 She was apparently the queen but she was nothing like a stuck up royal leader.
 She was more like a warrior who lead Igneeria in the ‚Äògood times.‚Äô She was really nice but when we had met her, I was in an awful mood.
 No one blamed me; I had just watched one of my best friends get beat up and taken right before my eyes.
 Her Majesty said to return in the morning when I would hopefully be in a better mood.
 So Jason, Emily and I walked to her throne room.

She was a virgin and planned to be one until her wedding night.
 How could he take that from her?
 How could he use an act of love to manipulate her into staying with him?
 And if she decided to go home anyway, how could he let her go home with the shame he knew she'd feel?
 He couldn't do it.
 No matter how much he loved her, no matter how much he wanted to make love to her and keep her with him, he couldn't do that to her.
 By the time Marie had washed her face and redone her make-up and brushed her hair, the hiccups were gone.
 Good.
 She could go kiss Rick.
 She smiled to herself, thinking about how sweet he was to her.

I was drenched, the material of the long gown soaked and heavy and more uncomfortable than ever.
 I loosened the wet corset ties and dropped the dress into a pile at my feet, shivering as I stepped free of it and onto a rock.
 I grabbed a shirt from the pile, and then the slim pants, aware of how nice the fabric felt, how good the cut.
 A leather vest laced over the top.
 It seemed they were tailored for me.
 I‚Äôd never had such luck making my own clothes.
 These were trim and fit, made for traveling.
 Not that I knew where I was going.
 My desire to trail Chevelle had been smashed, but there was no way I could return to the village.
 I glanced around.

"We might just have to make it a double wedding."
 Her mouth fell open.
 "You're betrothed?"
 "No, not yet.
 Carolyn and I are very serious, but I just couldn't think about proposing to her while you were still missing.
 But now .
 .
 .
 well, Mother has told me she's ready to give me the ring the moment I ask."
 Mrs. Tranton smiled.

As I stared at the empty space where he'd been standing just a second before, I felt my chest start to constrict, and my breathing speed up.
 The sense of terror racing along my synapses was completely irrational, and extraordinarily powerful.
 Just as the room began to spin crazily around me, I felt a gentle touch on my shoulder.
 "Mistress Paige, is there anything I can get you?
 Something to eat perhaps?
 Or if you'd rather, I can show you to the theater."
 I chopped off a hysterical burst of laughter just before it managed to emerge full force and totally embarrass me.
 Of course Alec had a theater in his house.
 Probably a pool and a gym too.
 Along with a half-dozen other amenities I'd never think of, but that the ultra-rich simply couldn't do without.

I-I just have to.
 I have to go home."
 They stayed locked in each other's arms, her tears soaking into his shirt, his tears dripping into her hair.
 At last, Rick, feeling weak and shaky, took Marie's hand and led her to the living room.
 They sat down on the sofa, and he drew her close.
 "I love you more than anything in the world," he whispered into her hair.
 "I love you too.
 But Rick--" "I understand.
 But I don't know how I'm going to bear it."
 They were quiet for several minutes.

Maybe the thoughts of death by poison or stabs in the dark made my stomach roil.
 Or maybe the cause was the sight of a dancer on the stage beside the bar.
 She was naked except panties sagged around her knees.
 I thought, the babe with auburn hair could be here in her place, if instead of having folks who were churchgoing gringos she had gotten born where I imagined this stoned, lost and weepy dancer had, as the fifteenth child of someone who lived in a hut beside a brown river.
 When a fellow vacated his bar stool, I excused myself from the table and moved there.
 I ordered another shot of tequila, and stared at the mirror behind the liquor shelf, wondering if I looked any different than before I surrendered to Jesus.
 I couldn‚Äôt spot a single feature that appeared more saintly or pure.
 I felt no more likely to hand over my jacket to whomever asked, let alone to throw in my shirt.
 The only change I recognized, I felt more confounded than ever.
 Someone had told me, when you drink tequila, make sure you count the shots.

Slip past their defenses and wait.
 When the battle comes, slaughter the elves from behind.
 You must weaken them enough so that Vaelor‚Äôs army has a chance at victory.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWe will not fail,‚Äù Qurrah promised.
 ‚ÄúWhere will we meet you?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúListen for where the screams are at their worst,‚Äù Velixar said as his shadow began to fade.
 ‚ÄúThere shall I be.‚Äù
 A pale hand reached inside his robes and pulled out five glass vials.
 Qurrah knelt and accepted the gifts.
 ‚ÄúThe vials contain powerful healing elixirs.

 We need to set a good example as adults.

 Ned ‚Äì Sir, there is no need to be rude, it was just a simple request for some common courtesy.
 Art ‚Äì You‚Äôre correct, there is no reason to be rude, and this is hardly the place for obscene language.

‚Äú _Hemorrhage._ ‚Äù
 A sudden purging of blood vessels exploded across Ahrqur‚Äôs side.
 The force smashed him into a decorative table.
 He rolled off the broken thing and glanced down at the blood soaking his robe.
 Despite the wound, no cut or hole was visible in the cloth.
 ‚ÄúYou are pathetic, Ahrqur,‚Äù Qurrah said, his hands whirling.
 ‚ÄúYou are skilled but you are soft.
 You lack spirit, will.
 It is why you cannot resist my power.

Afterwards Rodregas said to both, ‚ÄúI have been thinking that we are probably going to be here a few weeks while I finish healing up from the knife wound.
 I want to make the most of the time.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan said, ‚ÄúI have a feeling that you have some sort of training in mind.‚Äù Rodregas nodded and said, ‚ÄúI have developed some bad habits the last few years; I know my technique is rusty and now my timing is all off with my new body.
 I am not sure what your training backgrounds are, though.‚Äù He said, waving at Imeralda, who often of late was holding her Black Yew bow close with an intimacy that spoke more of a caress than holding a weapon, ‚ÄúClearly, Imeralda likes the bow.‚Äù Rodregas continued, ‚ÄúEven though Imeralda plans to stay out of the middle of things, learning some basic hand-to-hand and sword fighting is a good idea.
 Doi‚Äôvan and I can spar with each other, which will help us get used to fighting against the sigil warriors of The Immortal Guard.
 So, I think we should practice every morning until noon, then work to try to get the farm cleaned up during the rest of the day.
 At dusk we can work again on our fighting technique.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan nodded and said, ‚ÄúBefore we battle a group of Immortalists or The Immortal Guards, we need to get some decent armor and weapons.
 They will have the finest equipment that the Guild sorcerers can make or buy.
 While the two of us might be a match for most of the sigil warriors‚Äô one on one, their equipment will make them hard to beat.‚Äù ‚ÄúI agree that has to be something we figure out,‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚Äúbut, I am actually thinking decent horses might be more important first.‚Äù ‚ÄúHorses?
 How will that help us in battle?‚Äù asked Doi‚Äôvan.
 Rodregas responded, ‚ÄúWell, a true trained war horse can help directly, but what I am worried about is escaping after an attack.

I was the only one he spared, and he gave me life with all of his dwindling power.‚Äù
 The two sat in silence as the fire crackled between them.
 Qurrah dwelt on all he had heard, trying to decide what he believed.
 Strange as it seemed to him, he accepted every word.
 ‚ÄúSo what the priests say of how Karak is the god of death and darkness,‚Äù Qurrah asked, ‚Äúis it true?‚Äù
 Velixar‚Äôs eyes narrowed, and that vicious snarl returned.
 ‚ÄúThere were good men and evil men in his abyss after the war.
 The punishment was not to be eternal, not then, but Celestia chose Ashhur over my master.‚Äù Qurrah watched as Velixar‚Äôs hands clenched so tight his nails dug deep into his skin.
 Flesh tore, but no blood surfaced.
 ‚ÄúShe took all who were good out of the abyss and gave their care to Ashhur.

His senior picture, given a full page in our senior-year annual, a head shot of keen blue eyes with thick lashes, freckles, and sandy hair, a chin square as Dick Tracy‚Äôs, an easy grin that would have wrongly convinced you he was loaded with confidence.
 And the one Sylvia called the ‚ÄúJesus body picture‚Äù a snapshot somebody took in the locker room.
 Eric in a jock strap, beaming, his legs and arms spread as though to greet a familiar angel.
 Eric was superman.
 Strong, handsome, understanding, considerate, creative, vital, and brilliant.
 It was Eric who brought home Bertrand Russell‚Äôs Why I Am Not a Christian.
 My preferred reading was stories, but Eric wanted to commune with great thinkers and then talk about them, to explore ideas together, in hopes we might discover the meaning of life.
 As winter approached, we sat by the fireplace and took turns reading out loud.
 We admired Russell‚Äôs smug attitude, the gall of a fellow who accused Christ of utter arrogance for counting people vipers simply because they disapproved of his preaching.
 We delighted in Russell's arguments that Christianity was the principal enemy of moral progress in the world.

We hope and pray that Brandon will use the tools he has been taught to navigate through this world where drugs and alcohol are abundant and easy to obtain where ever you live and no matter who you are with.
 Brandon needs to have the strength and desire to embrace his new healthy body and see the ramifications of destroying himself and his family if he chooses to return to drugs.
 About the Author Bradley V. DeHaven is a Financial Planner in Sacramento, California, a husband, and a father of two sons, one of whom is a recovering Oxycontin addict.
 Brad is pictured here with Brandon in January 2011; Brandon, age 25, is 55 pounds heavier than the 130 pounds his 6‚Äô2‚Äù body weighed when he entered rehab.
 Brandon still fights the demons that call to him in his darkest moments.
 Prescription drug abuse is an epidemic which claims the lives of our youth.
 photo by Devin DeHaven, 2011
 I hope that this book and the website http://www.rxdrugaddict.comcan help addicts better understand that they are not just destroying themselves but also their family and friends.
 I hope they can see that they could have long and productive lives if they chose to feel life instead of numbing it.
 I also hope this can help people to think about their defining moments and to never give up on their addicted loved ones.

Most of them looked just like Simon and Nathanial, pony-sized wolves moving with blinding speed as they tore through doors and raced down halls.
 Brandon came in immediately behind the first batch of wolves.
 There was no way I could've known that the gray monster who casually sliced through walls and two-by-fours with his wickedly curved claws was Brandon, but I was somehow certain.
 He was built just like Alec had been Friday night, only so much bigger that he had to crouch forward to avoid hitting his head on the unusually high ceilings.
 Donovan faced off against one of the first wolves, but it was obvious he was no match for the grace and power of his opponent.
 The gentle, aging butler was knocked to the ground between one heartbeat and the next.
 I was mercifully spared from seeing the wreckage left when Brandon's wolves moved on, but there was no doubt in my mind that Donovan was dead.
 Screams, distant enough that they had to be coming from the other wing of the house, reached out and pierced my heart.
 There wasn't any way to be sure whether or not it was Rachel or her mother, but ultimately it didn't really matter.
 Brandon was going to kill all of us.

The great lion had to admit the shadow was odd, slimmer than his great bulk, strangely dark in the day and the shadow‚Äôs eyes seem to glow the bright yellow color of flame.
 He shook his great head and mane as if to free it from the strange shadow, and growled, ‚ÄúYou are a Goddess; you can see all.‚Äù Blodeuwedd nodded, she forgot to walk for a moment, as if in deep thought, but still she kept up with the Great Lion stalking through the grassland.
 ‚ÄúI can see all in our realm, and all in the mortal realm that is seen by one of our followers.
 I cannot see into the Infernal or Elemental Realms, and I think you have entered both.
 I do not know what this means.‚Äù The two continued through the grass for a few moments in silence.
 The Great Lion did not understand the Goddess‚Äô questions or concerns.
 But he understood his own power, which in its way was as great as any god‚Äôs.
 He growled, ‚ÄúDo you wish me to hunt, to fight?
 Is our pride in danger?‚Äù Blodeuwedd nodded, ‚ÄúYes and yes and yes.
 In their great quest for power, The Immortalist Taiga and his followers, such as that vermin Van‚Äôdret, must all be stopped.

The tinny blare of a car horn pulled me out the front door.
 Britney was waiting outside with her heater going full blast.
 I was surprised at how cold it was with the sun still struggling to get above the mountains.
 Of course it wasn't cold enough for me to need a heater, but I also wasn't wearing Britney's shorts, which looked like they were even shorter than the ones she'd worn the day before.
 It was amazing what the administration was letting everyone get away with.
 Of course, if I had legs like some of these girls, I'd probably be joining in.
 Britney turned down her rap music just long enough to say "Hi", and then we were off to school.
 The music was fairly hideous, but it did spare me having to try and be friendly before I was fully awake.
 Of course it also stopped me from digging further into the mystery of why it was so dangerous to hike.
 That particular question would probably have to wait at least until lunch.

 ‚ÄúSteed was certainly enjoying it, but, my dear, he won‚Äôt spill the secret to me.
 Whose strong back were you wrapped around, whose dark eyes‚Äî‚Äù I was mortified.
 There was nowhere to go, it was too much, and it turned to fury as she continued.
 I snapped.
 The flames that had been coursing through me burst in my hands.
 She laughed and tossed her head.
 ‚ÄúOh you should have heard it.
 You gave us such interesting details!‚Äù The image of Chevelle hearing my dreams, the sound of their laughter when I woke‚Ä¶ I knew what she wanted and I gave it to her.
 Fire shot from my hands toward her, hotter than any I‚Äôd ever produced.

I was having to catch up on a month's worth of assignments; she didn't have any right to get pissy just because she wasn't prepared.
 The third time it happened, I stopped pretending not to notice and shot Britney a sugar-sweet look of my own.
 She didn't quite seem to know how to take that and the rest of the class passed quickly.
 All too soon, it was time to go up and talk to Mrs. Campbell.
 I put off the ordeal as long as I could, waiting until everyone but Britney and I had exited the room.
 Britney looked particularly unhappy.
 Mrs. Campbell was looking at my homework when I reached her desk.
 "I was prepared to tear into you for not going to the tutoring lab last night, but that hardly seems fair seeing as how you went ahead and did the work by yourself."
 I felt a small glow of satisfaction flare into life, but her next words ensured it didn't get out of hand.
 "Of course, you've got the right answers, and technically you're attacking the problems correctly, but you're leaving out a couple of steps that I think will give you problems a bit later on.

And then, another time, when I decided to actually find a church I would go to more than once or twice, was on account of feeling quite blessed and knowing I ought to be spending more time thanking God than I ever would on my own.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow did you know which church to pick?‚Äù Such a question calls for more coffee.
 I pour a cup and say, ‚ÄúWell, the evangelical ones were where I found more people who actually tried to get closer to God.
 You know, to better understand God through all kinds of means.
 Intellect and others.
 I mean, I‚Äôm all for preachers showing how Biblical advise can help us be nicer, more prosperous, more benevolent, more likely to work toward human rights and all.
 But without the honest search for connection with the Holy Spirit, none of that good advice carries much weight.‚Äù
 Eric vs. Max Von Sydow
 Back on the road my thoughts pick up where they left off in San Luis Obispo, and I wonder if Brother Lawrence perceived his constant companion as the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit.
 Maybe my problem with adoring God is my habit of looking at, or for, God the Father, who in my vocabulary is easy to respect, admire, stand in awe of, or even worship, but is hard for me to adore.
 God, to me, looks more like a vapor.

He comes back drinking hard.
 And then, thank God, he met Toni.‚Äù The man from whom Cliff and Bill Torrey inherited their reserved and stoic characters snuffed and wiped his eyes.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you, that girl saved my son‚Äôs life.
 She dressed him down when he needed it, kicked him out when she knew it was best, and took him back as soon as he deserved it.
 I can‚Äôt tell you how much I owe that girl.‚Äù Toni teaches nursing at Cuesta College.
 She knows most everything about nutrition and raising kids.
 Before Cliff and I go out to slug golf balls into the trees, Toni and I talk in the kitchen.
 After a wandering conversation about food, kids and baseball somehow leads to spiritual matters, Toni mentions that she has always supposed people turn to God for comfort.
 What I don‚Äôt know about people in general could probably fill all the world‚Äôs libraries.
 But I can offer that I have turned to God at various times for a variety of reasons.

To do so risks no small amount of Alec's displeasure."
 "But you're going to anyways, aren't you?"
 "It is right that you know the sacrifice undertaken on your behalf, both by Alec, and by the rest of our family.
 The one because of his feelings for you, the other because of our respect and love for Alec."
 "It's true then; he can't win."
 "While it isn't impossible, it's unlikely.
 Alec is a remarkable fighter, to hear Donovan speak of it, he's possibly even almost the equal of his father, but Brandon's strength and speed have not seen a match in centuries.
 It's likely Brandon will emerge the victor."
 Even though, or possibly exactly because it was what I'd suspected, the words sent slivers of ice through me.
 My heart seemed to be having a hard time maintaining a steady rhythm, but I forced myself not to give into the panic attack that was promising temporary relief from the horror of my life.

Western governments and the international financial institutions, led by the IMF, strongly advocated this approach and linked financial assistance to its adoption.
 The strategy called for rapid deregulation of prices, privatization of farms and industry, introduction of a convertible currency, and balancing the budget to reduce the high fiscal deficits, primarily by reducing military expenditure and subsidies to producers and consumers.
 The assumption was that a programme with these elements would result in a significant increase in production, efficiency and the availability of consumer goods within a short time.
 The actual results were quite contrary to the expectations of these countries‚Äô Western economic advisers, as well as to the governments and people of the region.
 The initial phase of reforms had a disastrous impact on the economies, on the people and in some countries on peace and political stability.
 From 1990 to 1993 production in all 25 nations declined drastically, from a minimum of 10 per cent in Poland, 20 percent in Hungary and 22 per cent in the Czech Republic to a maximum of 45 per cent in Russia, 57 per cent in Latvia and 75 per cent in Armenia.
 Investment fell by an average rate of 13 ‚Äì14 per cent per year from 1990 to 1992, and by a three-year total of more than 50 per cent in Russia.
 The fall in real incomes followed that of output, and the impact was made even more severe, especially for pensioners, by the simultaneous dismantling of the vast social support system and dramatic increase in the cost of essential consumer goods.
 The drastic decline in living standards for the vast majority has been accompanied by the emergence of a new class of instantaneous millionaires, some on the basis of their ability in combining factors of production in new circumstances and others due to hoarding of goods under inflation, loopholes in newly enacted legislation on privatization, and personal influence with those in power.
 Inflation in most of these countries gained tremendous momentum as the reforms proceeded.

I have to go home."
 She squeezed his hand.
 "My home, my family, everything I know is in 1927.
 My mother has been saving her wedding gown for me.
 It was my grandmother's too.
 And-and I want my own daughter to wear it."
 But she wanted that daughter to be Rick's, she realized with despair.
 Rick kissed her cheek, his heart aching for both of them.
 "I understand, sweetheart.
 But I want you to know that I love you and that if you ever change your mind, I'll make you my wife and make you so happy you'll never regret your decision."

‚ÄúWe just wait it out like we always do.‚Äù Emily groaned and stretched.
 She opened her eyes, squinting at the two of us.
 ‚ÄúMorning.‚Äù ‚ÄúGood morning Emily, sleep well?‚Äù I asked, wondering if she had the same type of dream as we did.
 She shrugged.
 ‚ÄúI slept soundly, why?‚Äù ‚ÄúNothing, just curious.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she stood up and tip toed towards Jason.
 ‚ÄúNow the best part, waking up the grump.‚Äù She bent over close to his ear.
 She took in a deep breath and then yelled at the top of her lungs, ‚ÄúPIE!‚Äù Jason jumped up so fast that Emily had to jump back to avoid getting hit in the head.
 He almost fell backward but he steadied himself against the wall.
 One of his knives slid into his hand but by the time he realized what was going on, we were all laughing hard I was getting the hiccups.
 Jason panted out each word, ‚ÄúThat...is...not...funny!‚Äù He glared at Emily so hard she must of thought that he had laser eyes.

 I wasn‚Äôt sposed to tell anyone in the first place.
 I don‚Äôt think he would forgive me any time soon if he found out.
 Just don‚Äôt say anything about it, no matter what, please.
 Liz ‚Äì Ok ok, I won‚Äôt say anything, but I think we should still press charges against his father.
 Jim ‚Äì There‚Äôs no way to prove it, now please drop the whole subject, and try to forget about it.
 Liz ‚Äì I told you I would.
 God don‚Äôt you believe me?
 Jim ‚Äì well there was that time‚Ä¶
 Liz ‚Äì Stop bringing that up!

The third blow smashed the head to pulp.
 Rodregas probably should have picked up Nordien‚Äôs mace and shield, but he also knew that without plate armor, he could not afford a long drawn out series of pounding matches.
 Rodregas would fight like a lion instead.
 He charged the next closest squire who was approaching another squire.
 His new opponent never knew he was coming.
 He was heavily covered in armor with little visibility so he never saw Rodregas jumping on him from behind.
 This opponent was smaller and crashed to the ground at the unexpected weight of the attack.
 Rodregas was more careful in ripping off this squire‚Äôs helm, and punched him in the face but once.
 It was enough.
 He took out four other squires before anyone seemed to realize that he had changed the rules.

An orc stepped into the alley, blood splashed across his gray skin.
 He held a sword in each hand, dripping gore coating both.
 Shouting something in a guttural language neither understood, the orc charged.
 ‚ÄúGet back,‚Äù Harruq ordered as he shoved Qurrah to one side.
 He slammed himself against a house, barely dodging a downward chop of the blades.
 The orc attacked again, all his strength behind the swing.
 Harruq ducked, narrowly avoiding decapitation.
 Qurrah lunged before the orc could strike again, latching onto his wrist and letting dark magic flow.
 The orc howled at the sensation of a hundred scorpions stinging his flesh.
 Flooded with adrenaline, he hurled Qurrah aside, desperate to break the contact between them.

"Please don't make me cry again."
 They went back downstairs and lay on the sofa again.
 They talked quietly until they dozed off and then awoke, talked, and fell asleep again.
 A weak light was filtering into the room when Rick opened his eyes again, his heart heavy.
 In just an hour or so, he'd lose Marie forever.
 Marie opened her eyes to find Rick gazing down at her.
 "Good morning."
 "Morning."
 "I love you."
 "I love you too."

He sat up.
 ‚ÄúI think we're in some underground cave.
 When the ground collapsed, it must have carried us here.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat stinks,‚Äù I said.
 ‚ÄúAre we stuck here?‚Äù ‚ÄúNot unless you know a way to grow wings with nothing but dirt.‚Äù I stood up and tried to rake the dirt out of my hair.
 ‚ÄúWe're stuck here.‚Äù Seth sighed in frustration and brushed his blue  hair.
 He fluffed it up but the dirt was still stuck in globs.
 I rolled my eyes at his attempts.
 I turned around to see an entrance.
 I walked over and bent down.
 There seemed to be some kind of sign or symbol.

He made it big.
 For a price, yes.
 Those last songs, dripping with feigned self-pity, seem apocalyptic in retrospect.
 ‚ÄúAllison All Gone‚Äù and ‚ÄúGoodbye to the Shell‚Äù especially appear to comment on Buddy‚Äôs desire to burn his bridges, leave his Memphis past behind, forget his roots.
 And, of course, then there‚Äôs ‚ÄúBurn my Bridges‚Äù and ‚ÄúForget my Roots‚Äù off the second album.
 Even Buddy‚Äôs skillful acoustic playing can‚Äôt save those albums from their own wallowing, from their stooping to the lowest common denominator.
 Of course they sold.
 They were huge.
 Buddy played with Carole King, with the L.A.
 Session, with Linda Rondstadt.

The guard, with the speed of his sigil, blocked it.
 But he blocked it sword to sword instead of using the momentum and speed to simply guide the sword away from his body.
 The resulting blow had an unpleasant sound and cut right through Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs sword.
 Unfortunately for the guard, Doi‚Äôvan stepped forward as he swung and jammed the lower half of the sword into his opponent‚Äôs chest.
 The guard flew into the bushes with a sickening crunching sound.
 Rodregas next heard the sound of another of the enemy and spun into the sound using all his speed and strength, hoping to take a guard with either advantage.
 His target proved to be a slaver.
 He had a ragged beard and held a small battle axe.
 Rodregas‚Äô sword blow was too fast for the guard to block and had the strength to stun a guard wearing regulation armor.
 His sword cleaved the guard in half, and a gout of blood and gore splattered him.

I shot another and another, anger burning through me.
 Stop him.
 I turned around and saw Seth‚Äôs body through the dust.
 He looked up at me and mouthed, Jazell.
 ‚ÄúSeth!‚Äù I yelled.
 Then the dust and darkness swallowed him up until I couldn‚Äôt see him at all.
 Epilogue
 I padded silently through the long, dark halls.
 Emily and Jason walked wordlessly by my side.
 No one spoke because there was nothing to say, and so much to say, at the same time.

I would've been one of the former, except for Donovan."
 The questions continued to bubble up inside me, but I throttled them down, suppressing them rather than risking an interruption which might cause her to not finish.
 "At great risk to himself he carried me away from the site of the battle, running and swimming more miles than I care to think about.
 Eventually his strength finally gave way, and when he couldn't even crawl anymore, he found a cave and did his best to ensure I wouldn't die from exposure.
 As soon as he was able to move again, he went back and I haven't seen him since."
 "But how?"
 The question just kind of popped out before I could think.
 It could've been taken as the worst kind of insensitivity; Mallory just gave my hand another squeeze.
 "He hasn't always been crippled.
 In fact he used to be a delightful dancer.

Never would he have guessed that those two blades would shatter his own, pass through the explosion of steel, sever his spine, and cleave his body in two.
 The half-orc continued his charge, engaging the two elves behind.
 They struck as one, their swords aiming for vitals high and low.
 Harruq knew he could not block both, so he accepted a thrust curving to the side of his armor, grinning darkly.
 As the sword punched through the enchanted leather, the half-orc cut his adversary‚Äôs throat, using that same swing to parry the other attack away.
 The remaining elf swore as his eyes grew red and watery.
 He backed away from the half-orc, his sword held defensively before him.
 ‚ÄúWhat demon magic is this?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúMine,‚Äù said Qurrah.
 And then blood poured out from the face of the lone elf.

Overvalued exchange rates encourage the import of low-priced farm products, depress local farm incomes, and make exports uncompetitive.
 Underdeveloped infrastructure results in high transport and marketing costs.
 The slow rate of technological development and diffusion have slowed growth in agricultural productivity.
 Irrigation potential is underdeveloped and poorly managed.
 A major international commitment is needed to reverse the trends and end the famine threat in Africa.
 The region possesses considerable potential that could be converted into higher rates of growth.
 Africa has the world's largest reserve of arable land, one billion hectares, of which only 20 per cent is presently cultivated.
 Fertilizer use in sub-Saharan Africa is very low relative to other developing countries.
 Per hectare consumption averages just 13 per cent of the level in India and 3.5 per cent of the level in China.
 Recent studies indicate that the area under irrigated crops could be expanded four to five times, primarily through small, private irrigation systems.

It‚Äôs enough to make you question the whole machinery, you know?
 CM:  	So, between Turntable Poison and your California period, lies a great gulf that not a whole lot of people know about.
 I think we should try to understand what led you to this change, a real sea change in the eyes of the public.
 Can you talk a bit about that time?
 BG:  	First, as we‚Äôve discussed, I don‚Äôt see that big a change between Memphis and L.A.
 I mean, geographically, yes, Big City vs. hometown, sure.
 But, as for my art, there‚Äôs a direct line from Turntable Poison to Rain and Other Distractions.
 There‚Äôs a road if you wanna delineate it.
 CM: 	Really?
 That‚Äôs what I want to hear about.

My argument faltered, so I went back to anger, betrayal that he had lied to me.
 And not just him.
 The entire village must have known I was bound, known I couldn‚Äôt perform magic, as they sat and watched me try.
 Sending me to Junnie for lessons, allowing Evelyn to taunt me without recourse, giving me the blame for everything that happened.
 Because they expected me to turn.
 The horses slowed to a stop, irritating me further.
 I didn‚Äôt even have control over that.
 Chevelle stepped down and started a fire.
 When he walked away, I recalled what he had said earlier in the day, that you could stop someone‚Äôs heart.
 It hadn‚Äôt occurred to me that might be how he killed his prey.

Kojas did this on purpose, he‚Äôs trying to weaken us by splitting us up.
 He wants us to go running to him.‚Äù ‚ÄúI know what he‚Äôs trying to do, it‚Äôs driving me crazy.
 The nerve of this guy.‚Äù ‚ÄúFaery,‚Äù I corrected him.
 ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not a ‚Äòguy‚Äô, he‚Äôs some demon faery.
 Calling him ‚Äòguy‚Äô makes it sound like he‚Äôs just a normal human.‚Äù ‚ÄúDoes it matter right now?‚Äù he asked, through clenched teeth.
 I looked away.
 ‚ÄúI guess not.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe should move,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúI want to find out where we are and where the others are.
 We‚Äôre going to find them and I swear by the Bible, if Kojas hurt them, I‚Äôm going to kill him myself.‚Äù ‚ÄúSeth!‚Äù He shrugged.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too late now Jazell, I just swore by the Bible.

Tossing his washcloth into the clothes basket, he picked up a brush, and when she straightened after having brushed her teeth, he began smoothing her hair with long, slow strokes.
 Marie closed her eyes, tears seeping from them.
 She stood still for as long as she could, but finally, unable to bear the tenderness of his touch, she turned around and took the brush from him.
 "I'll never be able to go to the shore or drive a car or-or shop for bathing suits without feeling pain because it'll make me think of you.
 I don't want to have to stop brushing my hair."
 He smiled just a bit.
 "I don't think I'll ever go to the beach again."
 He took her hands, his face growing serious.
 "And I swear to you that I'll never go to Hollywood with another woman."
 She turned to reach for a tissue.

‚ÄúFew have such strength; taking a second greater sigil seems to consume far more power than one.
 It is not just twice as much, but far more.
 Only the most powerful have such magic, but you have the power of an Immortalist mage.
 I can‚Äôt promise it, but you should have such magical strength.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda watched silently as he reached out to touch the Celestial Lion, his hand again drawn to its mane.
 This time no voice spoke up to warn him away.
 The fur of the mane was surprisingly rough to the touch, and strangely, Rodregas smelled grass.
 EPILOGUE BEGINNINGS
 His large frame stalked through the grass, eager for the hunt to begin.
 The great Lion twitched his ears to the right.
 He had expected his nemesis, the White Stag, but instead walked a woman.

He couldn't do it.
 No matter how much he loved her, no matter how much he wanted to make love to her and keep her with him, he couldn't do that to her.
 By the time Marie had washed her face and redone her make-up and brushed her hair, the hiccups were gone.
 Good.
 She could go kiss Rick.
 She smiled to herself, thinking about how sweet he was to her.
 Already she was feeling better about ending her betrothal to Davis.
 She wanted a man who would spend time with her and hold her and make her feel safe and cherished.
 A man like Rick.
 Tears filled her eyes yet again, and she snatched up a tissue to dab at them to keep from ruining her make-up.

Singhelm had long since passed away, while Ceredon remained, two hundred years older, as the leader of the elven elite Ekreissar.
 It was in that clearing Antonil halted his army.
 The men shuffled around nervously, their eyes searching for enemies that always seemed to be hiding beyond their vision.
 The guard captain unrolled the edict, his gut sinking as he realized where he stood.
 Long ago, man and elf had agreed to live together in peace.
 Now, on that very same spot, he would rescind that agreement.
 Beyond the clearing loomed several palisades.
 All nearby windows were closed, and several boarded.
 A few humans stuck their heads out their doors to glimpse the armored men trampling through their city.
 Most kept themselves far from danger.

Her hair, as golden as his own fur, rained down her curved back; she wore a glowing short white shift adorned with many pouches.
 ‚ÄúWhy do you hunt with me, Goddess?‚Äù The Lion growled.
 The Goddess Blodeuwedd answered, ‚ÄúI am proud of you.
 I will be truthful, I shared my favor with you simply as a matter of convenience.
 I hoped you might succeed.
 I did not think you would live, much less add to your power and gather more hunters to our pride.‚Äù The great Lion shook his head, the ways of the winds and the speech of gods were the same, fickle and not to be truly understood.
 Yet he sensed that somehow the words sounded fair and right in some way that he could not really explain.
 Blodeuwedd smiled at him, a smile that answered nothing but claimed to answer everything.
 The two continued to walk through the tall grass.
 After a few minutes she spoke, ‚ÄúThe Gods and Daemon Lords are allowed to choose champions, but are not allowed to speak directly to any mortal.

The flames consumed his body in seconds, and flaring from the circle went the multi-colored energy of his magic, the one element that the circle was designed to protect from the flames.
 His magic power shot out of the circle and started orbiting the larger circle.
 He was completely gone.
 Rodregas excitedly thought, ‚ÄúVictory!‚Äù He had done it.
 He had killed the Immortalist Sorcerer Ravenhurr.
 The multi-colored energy of his magic swirled around the outer circle and was sucked into the empty vessel of the young man.
 The magic energy throbbed and Rodregas could feel the ritual screaming for the final release of the magic; there was no way to save anyone else.
 Rodregas would probably die in the next few seconds in the magical backlash of the failed spell, but he thought that he had understood the meaning of the final trigger words used in the rehearsal.
 Rodregas‚Äô years of rejecting his early upbringing made him embarrassed to say the words, but he reached down into that deep, nearly empty place where his little bit of power still sparked.
 Rodregas reached deep inside and pulled that spark of power up until he felt the tingle and inner sensation that he always inelegantly called ‚Äòmy itch.‚Äô Rodregas filled his words with the power and the intent behind them.

We still do not understand the impact of technology, trade, macro-economic policies, multinational corporations, shifting patterns of foreign investment and many other factors on job creation, and our ignorance severely hampers effective policy formulation and coordination.
 An international research programme should be organized under the ILO to construct a truly global employment model that monitors the impact of technological developments, expanding world trade, plant closings, movement of industry to low-wage countries, agriculture-led industrialization, economic growth, immigration policies, refugee movements and other factors affecting employment opportunities around the world.
 10.Shift focus of technological development: The number of jobs created or destroyed by technology depends on the priority given to various objectives in the process of technological development.
 Presently, there is an in-built bias in technological R & D towards replacing human labour with capital and energy, even when similar levels of quality and efficiency could be achieved by alternative means.
 A conscious shift of focus could lead to the development of more labour-intensive production processes.
 The production of more food to meet the needs of a burgeoning population has been one of the outstanding global achievements of the post-war period.
 It has demonstrated the extraordinary capacity of humankind to meet a collective challenge of monumental proportions.
 It has harnessed the power of science and technology for the most cherished of purposes ‚Äì preserving human lives.
 It has released the initiative and pride of long suppressed peoples to achieve self-sufficiency and determine their own destinies.
 It has finally lifted the suffocating blanket of pessimistic economic determinism that has stifled human hopes and aspirations for nearly 200 years since Thomas Malthus first set forth the thesis that human population will always outrun the growth of food production, thus ensuring the perpetual poverty of humankind.

He wouldn't be wearing a shirt, and, miraculously, her breath would be fresh and sweet.
 Those dreams were silly, of course.
 Not because they couldn't happen but because they could.
 Marie frowned as she poured soap into the washing machine.

 But she was betrothed to Davis.
 She shouldn't be kissing other men.
 But it was getting harder to remember that.
 Rick filled both her days and her thoughts.

"Of course.
 I believe they are in the north end of the valley.
 Right this way."
 We made good time, even with Donovan's jerky, oftentimes painful gait, but the estate was even bigger than I'd realized.
 We walked for several minutes before rounding a corner and finding the entrance to a hedge maze.
 "We're very nearly there.
 The maze serves as a final barrier against unwelcome eyes."
 I was lost within seconds, before we'd made more than four or five turns.
 "No wonder Alec laughed when I threatened to try and follow him.
 I'd starve to death before anyone found me."

Given the tight leash he kept his beast on, I would have been willing to bet that just about anyone else in the pack would have already shifted shapes and ripped a tree out of the ground or done something equally destructive by now.
 Alec shifted the phone slightly, I couldn't hear whoever was on the other end anymore, but whatever they'd just said hadn't made things any better.
 The invisible ants marching up my arms went to double time and the metaphysical breeze that started on his skin and went outward turned into a full-blown gale.
 "Stall them.
 We'll be down in eight minutes if worse comes to worst you two contain Isaac and tell Dom to sit on Jack.
 Keep Rachel out of the way."
 Already moving with the unearthly speed he normally concealed even from me, Alec hung up the phone and started throwing things into the backpack.
 "Jack's working himself up to a dominance fight with Jess.
 This couldn't have happened at a worse time.
 If we're not back before it starts odds are someone's going to die."

He was normally so careful not to prolong physical contact.
 Rachel and Jasmin were waiting for us as we reached the chairs.
 "Big brother, will you please take Jasmin out on the dance floor so she can get some practice following?
 I tried to lead last time and she kept tripping me."
 Alec gave me a considering look, and then nodded as I faked a smile at him and gestured my assent.
 Rachel turned to me as I suppressed a stab of jealousy.
 "I swear she's going to explode if Ben doesn't show up.
 Considering that dances are about the last place he'd ever go of his own free will, I think the odds are better than even that she'll leave little pieces of herself all over the park before the night is over."

"Oh, it wasn't a secret from you, just one you hadn't shared with me.
 Happy birthday.
 I've got a multi-part present in the works, but it's taking a bit longer to wrap it all up, so you may have to wait a little."
 As quickly as that, he winked and turned to catch up with Cassie, leaving me in a state of near shock.
 He'd been inside the house, but hadn't been able to see the kitchen, so he hadn't seen the cupcake and candle.
 I'd done web searches on my name and birth date before and never had it return anything legit, so he couldn't have found it out that way.
 Even that would've been an unheard-of level of effort coming from a guy, but however he really had learned it was my birthday must have been even harder than that.
 I felt like I was floating on a cloud as I hurried off to Biology.
 The feeling lasted exactly as long as it took me to sit down, listen to Mrs. Sorenson tell us all that she'd finished grading our tests, and then see the big, self-satisfied 'D' sitting at the top of my paper.
 For a second it felt as though my heart had stopped beating.

Not singing out loud, but making the power vibrate and move in a rhythm that matched the wood.
 When that magical rhythm was reached, the bow suddenly became almost fluid and moved nearly of its own volition.
 The arrows flew with incredible force and accuracy.
 The only problem was that the three could not practice freely as the arrows sometimes shattered on impact, as they flew with such force.
 Doi‚Äôvan quickly mastered the spell and the use of the bow.
 Rodregas, on the other hand, struggled to learn the artistry of the spell.
 One afternoon, a few days after Doi‚Äôvan had mastered the spell, Rodregas stood there with the bow trying hard to both find the rhythm of the spell and shoot the weapon.
 Imeralda stood next to him, her hand lightly touching the bow as she tried to figure out why he was still struggling with the mastery of the weapon.
 Rodregas reached down into himself, to that place that held his magic.
 Though Rodregas had never had much power, he had always enjoyed using his ‚Äúitch‚Äù (as he had always called it) to do small things.

It was rare enough to find a school teacher who could really teach math these days, finding a student who could teach was nearly a miracle.
 Rachel packed up her things while I was being instructed in the finer points of inequalities.
 As she slid the last book into her backpack, Albert stepped away from my desk with another smile.
 I flipped over to the next chapter and started in on functions as Rachel exited out a corner door I hadn't noticed before.
 I saw a flash of the stunted, brown vegetation that the locals called grass before the door swung back closed.
 Suppressing an urge to just surrender and go outside until Britney finished up, I got started.
 The roar of some kind of high-performance engine a few seconds later almost changed my mind, but my native stubbornness kicked in before I let the thought get out of hand.
 The subject matter was harder than graphing, but I persevered, and managed to make it through all fifteen problems without resorting to the red side of the card.
 Of course Albert did stop by to see if I was having any difficulties, but since I didn't summon him, he couldn't read anything into it.
 When Britney stomped over and asked if I was done, I considered telling her I needed ten more minutes.

My vision swam in and out of focus, but I struggled to my feet, only to nearly fall again as my right ankle all but collapsed under me.
 They were definitely closer now.
 They'd stopped howling, but I could still hear them.
 I somehow found myself on my back again, looking up at the biggest wolf I'd ever seen.
 TV had given me the impression that a wolf shouldn't be much bigger than a German Shepherd.
 These guys were roughly the size of a small pony, one nearly black, the other more of a gray color, both with yellowish eyes, and lips pulled back to show teeth the size of my fingers.
 Most of my jeans had been torn away from my right calf, which was bleeding fairly profusely, but I didn't feel any pain.
 It was like my mind had finally torn loose from the moorings that usually held it in contact with reality.
 I was going to die, ripped to shreds by the same impossible animals that had killed the hikers a few months ago, but I just couldn't bring myself to care.
 Nobody would even miss me.

We are better, superior.

 Harruq stood, brushed some dirt from his pants, and then offered Qurrah a hand.
 Together they trudged west, without food, water, or blankets.
 The guards watched them go, smirking all the while.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 That night Harruq collected a bunch of sticks and twigs, which Qurrah lit with a clap of his hands.
 The two huddled over the fire, each lost in their thoughts.
 Harruq broke the silence first.

When I knocked on the door of the hotel room, my father opened the door looked at me, called me Thomas, and then he looked at Bill and called him by my name.
 He didn‚Äôt even know what his own kids looked like.
 We spent a brief time in the hotel room getting our names and heritage correct then we were off to dinner.
 During the dinner, Richard asked if I could ‚Äúscore some toot‚Äù which I discovered meant find cocaine.
 Well, I didn‚Äôt need to look much past my pocket to score, so we ended up getting drunk and snorting toot to commemorate our father and son reunion.
 At the time, it seemed like, ‚ÄúWow, my dad is cool,‚Äù but I later realized how sick it all truly was.
 The fact is, this man was never a father or a dad or anything to me.
 Richard basically knocked my mother up in high school, married her, had another son and abandoned her and his sons while they were still babies.
 He never paid my mother a dime in child support.
 My mother tried to warn me when I decided I wanted to meet him, but as only time would tell, trying to tell your teenage son anything is a virtual impossibility.

She didn‚Äôt baby Eric.
 Rather, from all I saw, he might‚Äôve been the only human she considered her equal.
 But I rarely saw her with people.
 Now and then I would find her on the porch with a neighbor, gossiping about a different neighbor, but the only ones who got inside her dark little house were Eric and his friends, and Richard.
 He was a jazz pianist about ten years younger than Sylvia, and half a head shorter than either Eric or she.
 Just as Sylvia‚Äôs bluster made people wrongly suppose she was a drunk, Richard‚Äôs stupefied expression made me suspect he was a junkie.
 Sylvia had a piano, the only treasure in a living room full of hand-me-down furniture.
 When Richard wasn‚Äôt plunking on it, weaving garrulous runs around the melodies of old standards, he gawked at TV horror movies.
 Eric, Sylvia, and I discussed religion and books.
 She attended no church but disdained atheists.

Growing environmental concerns in the West have generated pressure for reducing fertilizer consumption in developing countries, when in most instances fertilizer application levels are lower than those in Western Europe by a factor of five or ten times.
 Increased, rather than reduced, use of chemical fertilizers will be essential to the expansion of agriculture in these countries and can considerably increase crop yields.
 Total fertilizer consumption by developing countries is expected to double by 2010.
 Furthermore, replacing macro-nutrients lost during intensive cultivation does not compensate for the depletion of more than a dozen micro-nutrients that also determine the quantity and quality of crops.
 Even in such agriculturally diverse countries as the United States and India, it has been demonstrated that better management of micro-nutrients can raise productivity substantially ‚Äì in some intensively cultivated areas by as much as 50 to 100 per cent or more in a wide variety of crops ‚Äì without significant changes in the structure or method of cultivation.
 Greater attention is needed to conserving and applying organic sources of manure and raising nitrogen-fixing crops, as well as to the use of bio-fertilizers.
 Unlike the creation of new irrigated lands, the application of such environmentally sustainable field practices is neither very costly nor technology-intensive, and can be widely propagated through improvements in agricultural training and extension.
 Increasing exports
 Over the next six years, the agreements reached during the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations are expected to reduce the tariffs levied by the industrial nations on agricultural products by 37 per cent and on tropical food exports by 43 per cent.
 Developing countries will cut agricultural tariffs by an average of 24 per cent.

His attacker came in hard and fast.
 Rodregas never saw the blow to his face, but luckily it was not a direct hit as Rodregas was already moving in close.
 Before the attacker could deliver another blow he was inside his opponents swing.
 Getting close is not always the best strategy on a powerful larger opponent.
 His attacker‚Äôs large hand reached for his face.
 Rodregas turned into his weight and tried to use his momentum to drive the large body off balance.
 But the attacker was built like a bull: broad and full of muscle.
 Rodregas‚Äô push against him had little effect.
 Something felt odd about this last attacker; his body felt wrong, not human.
 Rodregas thought, ‚Äúmaybe an Orqui?‚Äù That would explain the muscular build, but that did not seem totally right either.

He laughed.
 "I doubt it.
 Of course, I would have bet my life that not even one girl from the past would walk into my garden."
 He glanced down at her again.
 "Why?

 "Yes."
 She'd become so accustomed to being honest with him that she didn't even think about dissimulating.
 "Why?"
 When she merely glanced up at him and quickened her pace, he caught her arm.

It has simply shifted the field of expression from confrontation between nation states to confrontation between powerful governments and disenchanted, disenfranchised groups of individuals who respond to the application of superior power by nation states with the application of indiscriminate violence against the public-at-large.
 Terrorism thrives in the absence of effective democratic institutions to give voice to the will of its citizens.
 At the same time, lifting the tyranny of state terrorism has itself become the occasion in some instances for an outburst of violence by long suppressed groups.
 Eradication of terrorism is possible, but it demands a comprehensive and integrated approach and concerted, collective action.
 The commercialization of the arms trade ‚Äì which benefits some countries economically at the expense of the security of all nations ‚Äì must be subject to rigorous monitoring and control by international agencies.
 Vested economic interests that thrive on conflict must be placed under UN surveillance and regulation.
 International institutions must be strengthened to eradicate arms smuggling, narcotics, offshore money laundering and other criminal activities that serve as seedbeds and instruments for terrorism.
 However, no final solution to the problem of terrorism can be arrived at by force alone.
 While terrorism is frequently attributed to religion and ideology, it sprouts and thrives most readily among populations that lack opportunities for gainful employment and economic development.
 Social unrest is an expression of the upward aspiration of those who have been left out of the political and development process or who feel threatened by the rapid pace and stress of social change and inequity.

He was thrilled when she didn't say she'd probably be back in 1927 before then.
 She was quiet during the ride home, remembering the scene she'd done.
 And how she'd peered through a camera.
 And sat in a director's chair as he walked his sitcom actors through a scene.
 It hadn't been a page out of a fairy tale like she'd expected, but it had been exciting nevertheless.
 And a dream-come-true.
 "I feel gritty.
 I think I'm going to jump in the shower," Rick told her when they got back to the hotel.
 "Me too."
 She would have preferred a bath, but she was afraid she'd fall asleep in the tub.

But today, without having passed through the ravages of war, the republics desperately seek foreign support and feel helpless without it.
 It is right that the world community should generously support the successful completion of the reform process in this region that is so vital for world peace.
 But it is also right that these countries should recognize the enormous untapped potentials which they possess ‚Äì human, natural and productive ‚Äì rather than be distracted by the prospect of a large influx of foreign capital.
 ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY IN YUGOSLAVIA
 The extreme damage wrought by the economic reform programme in these countries over the past half decade necessitates an urgent search for more viable alternatives, a search that has been retarded until now by the widely held view that none exists.
 Very recent events in Yugoslavia suggest that even in the limited area of economic stabilization and adjustment, an alternative strategy can be more successful.
 Although the long-term impact of the Yugoslav experiment is an yet unknown, its remarkably positive initial results merit serious consideration.
 The economic disorder that accompanied recent political developments in Yugoslavia resulted in an explosive increase in prices of more than 100 per cent per month in 1992.
 Despite efforts to control monetary expansion, hyperinflation exceeded three million per cent in 1993 - far higher than the inflation rate reached in Germany following the First World War and, quite probably, the highest rate in recorded history.
 The price spiral was accompanied by a steep fall in real purchasing power by as much as 75 per cent.

I could hear the police and undercover officers talking about me amongst themselves.
 In one exchange, a uniform officer asked an undercover officer what they busted me for and who I was turning on.
 The undercover officer told him I was the father of a kid they busted and I was ‚Äúworking my son‚Äôs deal.‚Äù The uniform officer responded that he had never heard of that before to which the undercover officer replied that this, as far as he knew, was a first.
 After I was wired, tested, and instructed to put my shirt and jacket back on, the briefing began.
 A loose circle of about a dozen officers stood between my truck and the van that would record the sting from the wire I was wearing.
 I would call the target soon and instruct her to meet me in a particular spot.
 Things moved rapidly now and the instructions came quickly.
 I was instructed to get as much incriminating conversation as I could, including the price, quantity and name of the drug; anything beyond that would be helpful but gravy.
 The main thing was to get the money for the drugs.
 Then I was shown the contents of a small white plastic bottle: One hundred Oxys poured into the officer‚Äôs hand.

I giggled.
 Evelyn shot a glower at me.
 And then she whirled, storming away, and as she glanced back, her parting expression was so priceless I wished I could see it again.
 ‚ÄúAchoo!‚Äù ‚ÄúChoo!‚Äù ‚ÄúHachoo!‚Äù My ears popped as I burst out with laughter.
 Evelyn began to run toward town and I couldn‚Äôt stifle it, despite the fact that it was absurd something as insignificant as a sneeze would give me such pleasure.
 I wondered briefly how I‚Äôd delight in a choking fit and then tugged the lobe of my ear as it popped again.
 Apparently I wasn‚Äôt used to laughing.
 I strode off toward home, taking the long route despite my good humor.
 As I approached the old tree, its twisted and gnarled limbs reaching into a cloudless gray sky, I caught sight of an aged elf leaving.
 My stomach dropped; it was a Council member.

 Qurrah shot him a glance, his meaning clear.
 The half-orc shrugged, drew his swords, and began walking.
 A sleek staircase led to the upper floor, while through the hallway they could see a room with an iron stove and shelves for storing food.

 ‚ÄúUp,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúAnd quiet, before you wake him.‚Äù

I hold it out to him, he takes it from me and turns it off, and he says, ‚ÄúWe got them.‚Äù I am so relieved but that is only one answer to one question and I have many.
 The deal was done and I was so relieved that it was over.
 I then called my wife who was so wound up from the lack of communication over such a long period of time.
 She sobbed uncontrollably as I told her I was unharmed, headed home, the ordeal was over and we busted the drug dealers.
 A hero‚Äôs welcome awaited me, as my son was so thankful for what I had done for him.
 As I went to bed that night, my mind would not shut off and the events of that evening replayed in my head over and over again.
 I lay awake for hours wondering what would have happened if the dealer hadn‚Äôt run into the cops.
 They both confessed to the drug deal when separately interrogated.
 The officer said they had less than half of the money, which she had attempted to hide in a trash can in the Starbucks‚Äô bathroom, and Steve had a gun, which Ashley admitted they would have used if I didn‚Äôt give them the drugs once I discovered they were short on cash.
 They were going to rob me at gunpoint!

A thin line of blood appeared on the half-orc‚Äôs forehead, but he was oblivious to it.
 His hands were around his enemy‚Äôs throat and his strength at its greatest.
 The crunching flesh underneath his fingers was all that mattered.
 The elf behind him retrieved his sword and attacked, his right arm hanging useless, his left stabbing desperately.
 Harruq flung the dying body around by the neck.
 The sword buried up to the hilt in the makeshift shield.
 Harruq dropped the dead elf and lashed out.
 His backhand broke the elf‚Äôs jaw.
 Reeling, the elf staggered back, only able to raise his meager arm above his head.
 Harruq smashed an elbow into his chest, followed by knuckled fists atop his skull.

She turned to see a female elf, a friend of hers from many years before she moved to Woodhaven.
 ‚ÄúYes, Felewen?‚Äù
 Felewen stood beside her and faced the window.
 Her hair was tied in a long, black ponytail, her slender figure covered by rare chainmail crafted of the hardest metals known to the intelligent races.
 She had come from deep within Nellassar, the thriving capital of the Dezren elves, as just one of many that had arrived to protect the town.
 ‚ÄúMany are dying,‚Äù Felewen said.
 ‚ÄúThe humans have a spellcaster of their own who repelled our ambush.‚Äù
 Aurelia nodded.

Wrong on the features of someone who couldn't possibly need help from a mere mortal, but still there.
 "It's so beautiful.
 I don't know what to say.
 Are you sure you want to give it up?"
 Alec looked back up at me, and his eyes were filled with incredible need.
 I was suddenly struck by the similarities to the me he'd painted, and what I saw written on his face.
 It seemed impossible he would be unsure, that a glorious being like him could ever need anything I could provide, but I couldn't deny it was there.
 There was no way of knowing what it was, but I didn't care.
 Whatever it was he needed I wanted to give him.
 I opened my mouth to say as much, but my vocal chords wouldn't cooperate.

 Jim ‚Äì Good idea I guess.
 Art ‚Äì What‚Äôs amiss now?
 Jim ‚Äì Look around, we either have too few teams or too many.
 I‚Äôm not playing scrabble against you alone again.
 Last time we did you spiked the little wooden-dealy that holds the letters when you won.
 Art ‚Äì Well I did go out by using all my letters on a triple word score space and I Just got excited.

 Eugene ‚Äì Ummm‚Ä¶.
 Cleo ‚Äì Those teams sound wonderful.

He did let up on the knife for a second though.
 Instead of following up, Rodregas used the momentum of his kick to swing his body sideways.
 Skilled, close up fighting was all about leverage.
 Instead of resisting the attacker‚Äôs strength Rodregas pushed down on the earth with his hands and lifted his body up and to the side, curling the leg he had kicked out underneath.
 He planted his foot under his body.
 His attackers seemed confused, grabbing him and trying to counter his change of position.
 Rodregas only had one leg under him, but he pushed off with it with all his strength and thrust himself up.
 It should have failed with all the men holding him down, but he now had celestial strength, and even with the knife wound he was strong.
 His attackers backed off, confused by the fact that he had gone from being their prisoner to suddenly rising.
 The person pinning Rodregas‚Äô left arm got too far away.

A car door slammed, and she saw a sleek gray car back out of a driveway.
 She‚Äôd wandered far from Rick‚Äôs house .
 .

 but she was still in 2011.
 She took a minute to get her bearings and then wandered back toward Rick‚Äôs house.
 He was perched on the edge of a chair and sprang to his feet when he saw her.
 ‚ÄúAre you all right, sweetheart?‚Äù he asked, taking her hand.
 ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt get home.‚Äù Tears filled her eyes.
 ‚ÄúI tried so hard.

I couldn‚Äôt take out one of these like, this unless I set it on fire.
 But Emily wasn‚Äôt here.
 I could take it out with a few arrows but it‚Äôs best to kill Thrashers before they realize you‚Äôre there.
 Instead I lowered my bow and slowly crept up to it, until I could see the hideous claws on its hands and the hatred in its eyes.
 Thrashers hate everything and sometimes I wonder how they tolerate each other.
 I aimed for the head again and released the arrow.
 It whizzed silently into the thrasher and it howled in pain as the arrow dug into its fur.
 It whirled around, facing me.
 A low growl sounded in its throat and it charged.
 I ducked as it slashed my side and I winced.

‚ÄúIt depends.‚Äù ‚ÄúOn what?‚Äù Seemed like an obvious followup.
 ‚ÄúYour mood.‚Äù I was irritated all over again, but got distracted when she licked the point of an arrow.
 ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù She grinned.
 ‚ÄúLook, Frey, I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre up for this story right now.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt think she was funny.
 She sighed.
 ‚ÄúOkay, but you‚Äôll probably regret it.‚Äù ‚ÄúJust give her the short version, Ruby,‚Äù Steed interrupted.
 ‚ÄúNo gory details.‚Äù His eyebrow cocked meaningfully.
 ‚ÄúOh, well, yes, that would do.‚Äù She smiled at me as she licked another arrow, tongue sliding carefully along the blade.
 ‚ÄúYou see, my dear, being a one of a kind‚Äîwell, as far as I know‚Äîhas its benefits.
 Though they weren‚Äôt always benefits.

It was a Council marking and something else.
 I dug out the first pages from under my mattress and examined them closer.
 The pages directly from the record-keeper‚Äôs report all included the same Council mark plus a string of characters.
 Trying to decode them, I realized one of the symbols might simply be a page number.
 And the others, they were probably locators.
 I felt like a fool.
 They were just like the codes used in the library, only more elaborate.
 No one really used the ciphers, you didn‚Äôt need them with magic, but they had been added to many of the pages when the fairies had started tracking clan histories.
 I was holding in my hand the information I needed to find the northern clans in the Council‚Äôs library.
 My stomach tightened, but I found myself getting up and heading toward the village, regardless of the consequence.

 Jim ‚Äì She took the ones that we bought him back to the stores, and the rest she gave to the rest of it all to the Salvation Army.

 That was just one event.
 She told him that sort of thing all his life, when she wasn‚Äôt trying to control all of our lives.
 She ground him into the dirt at every opportunity.
 Liz ‚Äì How did you and your father get through it when poor Johnny didn‚Äôt?
 Jim ‚Äì Dad spent a lot of time at work.
 There were some weeks when he was working 60 hours or more.
 He always claimed that he was trying to support the family, but after the shop became more and more successful he was making some damn good money.

In my heart, Billy Torrey was my little brother, and would be for years to come.
 We would play music and perform together in a coffee house, until he married and moved away.
 Not long after our one date, Serena died in a car crash.

 I hadn‚Äôt minded her snitching to Liz.
 She was a sweet girl, and Liz was her friend.
 But I had seen too many funerals.

 Britney looked like she was having a hard time getting enough air.
 She gasped a couple more times, and then managed to get some words out.
 "I'm so sorry.
 I didn't realize you'd care.
 I thought it would be okay."
 I pinned her in place with my eyes for several seconds to prove I didn't believe her, and then shrugged.
 "I don't suppose it matters all that much.
 I just know now that I can't trust you with those kinds of things."

The elf sighed, clutching her staff to her chest as she slumped against the side of a house.
 The battle was over‚Ä¶‚Äåbut would the man in black obey the call?
 She thought not.
 Suddenly a hand closed about her mouth.
 The foul smell of sweat and dirt filled her nostrils.
 An arm reached around, pinning her staff and hands against her chest.
 ‚ÄúWe may have to leave,‚Äù a voice growled into her ear, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm not leaving without something to remember.‚Äù

The sudden spike was enough to make my hair stand on end, but Jim Hansen hurried by without any indication there was something out of the ordinary.
 "You're in our way, half-breed."
 I felt Alec's grasp tighten slightly, but considering the crushing strength he was capable of, it was the closest thing imaginable to a non-response.
 Brandon was coming up behind Vincent, as Alec reached up and placed his own hand on Vincent's chest, with another, stronger flash of power.
 The ripple of skin and bone was so quick for a second I couldn't believe what I was seeing, but there it was.
 Alec's hand and fingers had elongated, turning into a hairless replica of the deadly claw that'd terrified me just a few days before.
 Vincent's bulk was such that it screened Alec's movements from passersby, as those razor-sharp claws sank just the barest distance into his chest.
 Alec spoke for the first time, and the even tone of his words was a stark contrast to the winds of power that seemed almost ready to throw me across the hall.
 "You forget yourself, mutt.
 As the leader of another pack, I'm due more respect than that.

 He swallowed the last of his tea.

 "Actually, it would probably be very valuable.

But there is little hope of abolishing this menace without simultaneously comprehending and addressing the root causes of terrorism in the world today.
 In a sense, the human urge for violence has neither increased nor decreased.
 It has simply shifted the field of expression from confrontation between nation states to confrontation between powerful governments and disenchanted, disenfranchised groups of individuals who respond to the application of superior power by nation states with the application of indiscriminate violence against the public-at-large.
 Terrorism thrives in the absence of effective democratic institutions to give voice to the will of its citizens.
 At the same time, lifting the tyranny of state terrorism has itself become the occasion in some instances for an outburst of violence by long suppressed groups.
 Eradication of terrorism is possible, but it demands a comprehensive and integrated approach and concerted, collective action.
 The commercialization of the arms trade ‚Äì which benefits some countries economically at the expense of the security of all nations ‚Äì must be subject to rigorous monitoring and control by international agencies.
 Vested economic interests that thrive on conflict must be placed under UN surveillance and regulation.
 International institutions must be strengthened to eradicate arms smuggling, narcotics, offshore money laundering and other criminal activities that serve as seedbeds and instruments for terrorism.
 However, no final solution to the problem of terrorism can be arrived at by force alone.

 ‚ÄúDeath is nothing but a recruitment tool for you.‚Äù
 Half an hour later, he and a hundred other elves riding atop pegasi followed the necromancer north.
 As they flew, they passed over a small campfire dotting the empty field below.
 Their passage above went unheard and unseen, for the two lone souls sitting on opposite sides of that campfire were deep in conversation.

This productivity gap between what is routinely achieved by different countries represents a vast immediate potential for improving yields that does not require significant additional investment of time or money in R & D. The world already possesses the knowledge, technology and organizational capacities to raise considerably average world yields in major crops.
 Emphasizing cultivation practices
 The phenomenal increases in productivity achieved over the past three decades through the development of improved and hybrid varieties of seeds have over shadowed and distracted attention from the equally great potential of raising yields through improvements in methods of cultivation.
 This is especially true since much of the slowdown in productivity growth is attributable to depletion of soil and water resources, which can be partially rectified or offset by improved practices.
 Growing environmental concerns in the West have generated pressure for reducing fertilizer consumption in developing countries, when in most instances fertilizer application levels are lower than those in Western Europe by a factor of five or ten times.
 Increased, rather than reduced, use of chemical fertilizers will be essential to the expansion of agriculture in these countries and can considerably increase crop yields.
 Total fertilizer consumption by developing countries is expected to double by 2010.
 Furthermore, replacing macro-nutrients lost during intensive cultivation does not compensate for the depletion of more than a dozen micro-nutrients that also determine the quantity and quality of crops.
 Even in such agriculturally diverse countries as the United States and India, it has been demonstrated that better management of micro-nutrients can raise productivity substantially ‚Äì in some intensively cultivated areas by as much as 50 to 100 per cent or more in a wide variety of crops ‚Äì without significant changes in the structure or method of cultivation.
 Greater attention is needed to conserving and applying organic sources of manure and raising nitrogen-fixing crops, as well as to the use of bio-fertilizers.

 ‚ÄúWell, I have to say I am very tired of talking so I will make this quick,‚Äù she said with her normal sunny smile.

 ‚ÄúFirst, Geriodon is much disliked.
 He is gruff, unfriendly and too serious to like.
 The squires and knights universally dislike him.
 This is his third attempt to achieve knighthood and he has gotten closer each time.

 ‚ÄúI went and chatted with him,‚Äù she continued ‚Äúand he hates the Immortalists, but is rather unpleasant and needs to take a bath.
 But he is also clearly very honorable.

 All four of us stood there waiting and when he got his breath back, he spoke.
 ‚ÄúI am glad that you accepted my message,‚Äù he said to Seth and me.

Simply stated, she was scared.
 She was young, barely more than a girl, and not a trained warrior.
 She was also much more fragile than either Doi‚Äôvan or Rodregas; a blow that would only stun the two of them would shatter her.
 Her incredible magic power would do her little good in a stand up battle.
 For all of that she gave a nod; she was willing to follow his lead.
 If he wanted to attack, she would follow them.
 How could someone so young and inexperienced be so brave?
 How could he not honor such bravery?
 Rodregas looked into Imeralda‚Äôs eyes.
 She had been watching him.

‚Äú _Hemorrhage,_ ‚Äù the half-orc hissed.
 The elf‚Äôs face exploded.
 Qurrah fell over onto his side, breathing as slowly as he could through the blood that filled his throat.
 The dead body of the elf crumpled in front of him, all of his hate-filled features gone from his face except for a single eye.
 The half-orc stared, wondering if his brother was truly dead.
 Darkness crept at the corner of his sight.
 His strength was fading fast, and he had little doubt that if he passed out he would never wake.
 He struggled to lift a single numb hand, then flopped it down on top of the dead elf‚Äôs leg.
 Qurrah took as deep a breath as he dared and then spoke the words of a spell.
 Each syllable was slow torture, garbled in blood and born of pain most horrid.

‚ÄúBut we were out of options and it was the only thing I could think of.‚Äù Then she added with more confidence, ‚ÄúPlus, while everyone knows a knight might learn a bit of magic, a sorcerer never learns to fight.
 They have servants for that.‚Äù The three shared a smile at that.
 Rodregas was very glad that he had insisted that she learn the fundamentals of blade work.
 ‚ÄúSo what now?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúNow we go see if we can get some greater sigils,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúWe?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúAnd have you decided to take a greater sigil even it if cost you most of your magic?‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan nodded and said, ‚ÄúYes, I like to learn magic, but we are on a mission, one that is very important.
 The Immortalists, especially Taiga, must be stopped.
 If we are going to do that I will be of most use as a warrior.
 We have a powerful magic user,‚Äù he said with a smile.

My last conversation with Ashley seemed a little muffled and the cops want to make sure they get a clear recording of the drug deal.
 The reason I am here and have insisted that I do this is complicated.
 I think I am here to save my family the anguish of watching another family member go to jail, not wanting to relive the time I watched my brother Thomas go to a federal prison for dealing drugs many years before.
 Maybe I am here because I just don‚Äôt know how to be a father and despite my attempt to be the best father I never had, I have failed miserably!
 Officer White coaches me through the sound check.
 Apparently the microphone at my jacket collar is slipping down and everything is muffled.
 I am told to pull it up, but warned that it might easily disconnect and if it did, the bust would be aborted.
 After some light tugging on the mic to get it between my collar and my neck, Officer White says the sound is good.
 As we talk on the phone, he assures me that I am doing fine and I should continue to hold my position no matter how hard Ashley and Steve try to get me to go to their location.
 The attempt to move me is a tactic the narcotics‚Äô officers know well.

 She looks wildly at me as she turns and runs back into the Starbucks, frantically making her way through the patrons headed towards the back of the shop.
 I have no idea what just happened.
 I sit there dumbfounded, thinking the worst and that we have lost this bust forever.
 Maybe she saw something or the phone call was from her boyfriend who had seen something.
 I call her on her cell phone and to my surprise she answers, she is frantic.
 She quickly states that they left, the deal is off and they are headed home.
 Her voice echoes as if she is in a closet.
 I know she hasn‚Äôt left because I just saw her run to the back of a Starbucks that I know well.
 She is nearly in tears and suddenly hangs up.

 Jim ‚Äì Hey yeah, take that.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, at least you answered me,‚Äù I shot Seth a look.
 ‚ÄúWell if it‚Äôs okay with you boys, we would like to get to bed.
 It‚Äôs almost 1:30 in the morning, and I would like to get home before my dad wakes himself up,‚Äù Emily said, and walked towards her house.
 I waved quickly and followed.
 The rest of the night was quiet and didn‚Äôt include singing dwarfs.
 Before we went to bed though there was a lot of furious writing as Emily tried to write everything down.
 After that, was all sleep.
 In the morning, we ate pancakes that Emily‚Äôs mom had made us and set off for the park.
 We happened to run into Jason and Seth half way and at the same time watched a pole freeze in the middle of July.
 You don‚Äôt get to see that every day, which usually meant there was a monster involved.

Liz wanted more attention from me than I wanted to give.
 But we played fairly well together until, one Sunday evening, I wanted to go to a certain dance, which was held weekly and at which I always danced with other girls in addition to Liz.
 This time, Liz wanted me to myself, at her place.
 Her folks were out of town.
 Maybe the proposition and setup spooked me.
 Anyway, for reasons lost to time, I went to the dance alone, and afterward took Serena Furby for a ride.
 I hadn‚Äôt known that Serena and Liz sat next to each other in summer school.
 Liz called me various names and tried to get our friend Les Falos to thrash me.
 He considered the proposition, then laughed it off.
 A couple weeks passed before Bill Torrey came and asked if I would mind him taking Liz out.

When it does come, that means war is on the horizon.
 Our glorious time has almost arrived.‚Äù
 Raising a pale hand, he dismissed them.
 Qurrah turned to leave, but Harruq lingered.
 ‚ÄúMaster,‚Äù he asked, ‚Äúwhen this fight starts, which side will we be on?‚Äù
 His brother narrowed his eyes, knowing exactly why the question was asked.
 Velixar, however, seemed either not to know or not to care.
 ‚ÄúIf the elves win, Vaelor will have no choice but to leave them be.
 The assault of my orcs has weakened his army.
 They cannot suffer any more losses.

I felt something on my hand and I looked down.
 Seth had wound his fingers in mine.
 His touch was gentle and cool, kind of reassuring.
 My mind blanked.
 I was holding hands with Seth.
 I never thought that would happen.
 Seth smiled sheepishly.
 ‚ÄúJazell, you should just relax.
 Let them bicker all they want; we don't have to be a part of it.
 Get some sleep.‚Äù My mind was still slow, trying to process why he was holding my hand.

She'd been caressing Marie's hair and shoulders and arms.
 "You seem to be having a problem with that yourself."
 He grunted, stroking Marie's cheek and then tilting her chin up.
 "We have been out of our minds with fear.
 We had no idea what had happened to you."
 "I know.
 Thinking about how worried you'd be was the worst thing about being gone."
 "Are you all right?
 Are you hurt anywhere?"
 "I'm fine.

"What happened?"
 "She turned cool seven or eight minutes into the conversation, finished her drink, said thank you, and left."
 "She knows what she wants.
 I suppose you have to give her credit for that."
 That conversation left a bad taste in Rick's mouth, and he arrived at Ted and Lauri's that evening feeling wary.
 "Hi--I'm glad you said to dress casually," Rick greeted Ted, shrugging out of his coat.
 "I hate to get dressed up when it's raining."
 "Sharon insisted.
 She said set-ups are awkward enough without all the formality."
 He hung Rick's coat in the closet.

And he held me, Mother."
 She looked into her mother's eyes earnestly.
 "Whenever I was frightened or sad, he held me.
 It became so natural to move into his arms for consolation.
 And I felt so comfortable with him.
 I was more comfortable with him after five weeks than I would have been with Davis after five years of marriage."
 Mrs. Tranton frowned a bit.
 "Marie, are you .

 She twisted her head about to kiss his throat.

 She kissed him, her hands moving restlessly over his chest.
 Nuzzling his ear, she told him, "It's probably wrong for me to tell you these things.

I focused on it hard, willing it to rise.
 When nothing happened I looked for Chevelle‚Äôs reaction.
 He watched me, his serene mask back in place.
 ‚ÄúDo you need motivation?‚Äù I was afraid of the kind of motivation he‚Äôd provide, remembering the fireballs flying at me in the meadow.
 ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù My answer was too quick, and he laughed.
 I knelt closer to the gray rock.
 I thought it moved a little, as if trembling in fright, and the notion had me shaking my head.
 Chevelle stood.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trying too hard, Freya.
 Let us play a game.‚Äù He held out his hand and a stone flew up from the ground to land in the center of his open palm.

 He shuddered.
 "Are you sure you're feeling all right?"
 Marie asked him, having seen his shudder.
 "Maybe you had too much sun this weekend."
 She leaned over to feel his forehead.
 "Hmmm.
 You may have a slight fever.
 I'm going to get you some aspirin and juice."

It whizzed silently into the thrasher and it howled in pain as the arrow dug into its fur.
 It whirled around, facing me.
 A low growl sounded in its throat and it charged.
 I ducked as it slashed my side and I winced.
 My shirt slowly turned blue from the trickling wound.
 Yes, blue, my blood is blue.
 It turned back around and threw its self at me.
 This time I was prepared.
 I pulled out my hunting knife out just as he landed on me.
 He yelped and went limp.

Wondering why, after I had spilled my guts, he appeared to revel in my further humiliation, I flew into a rage, sprang to my knees, and socked him in the stomach.
 I pounced on top of him and socked him again, before he caught hold and flipped me, lashed my arm behind my back and shoved my face into the floor.
 ‚ÄúListen,‚Äù he said, without a hint of condemnation, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not really mad at me.
 You‚Äôre mad at yourself, because you think you‚Äôre nobody, but you‚Äôve got it all wrong.
 It doesn‚Äôt matter if I wrestle better.
 Wrestling‚Äôs my sport.
 What if you and I were playing golf or baseball and you clobbered one out of sight, but I hit this little dribbler, then started whining?
 ‚ÄúIf Karen doesn‚Äôt like you enough, that doesn‚Äôt matter either.
 Because you‚Äôre as great as anybody.
 You‚Äôre Ken Kuhlken, and that‚Äôs all you need to be.

I finished early, but I should have started on one of the catch-up assignments.
 I just didn't want to get into a whole new subject with only ten minutes left."
 Her smile was much more understanding than normal for a classroom situation.
 It took the sting out of the words that were probably just for the people close enough to overhear.
 "Don't you worry, Miss Paige, I'll let you know when I don't think you're keeping up.
 Seeing as you are done though, would you please run something over to Mrs. North?
 I'd do it, but I need to go to a special projects meeting today during lunch."
 As quickly as that, my books were in my backpack and I was on my way to the second story of the school, which housed music, sketching, and all the other forms of art lesser mortals like me would never master.
 The journey would've been completely unremarkable except that I happened to glance into one of the classrooms just before I found Mrs. North's room.
 Even a brief glance screamed art students.

Starlings, New York is not the place you‚Äôd expect much to happen.
 It‚Äôs a small quiet town, the kind where everyone knows your name.
 It‚Äôs a place where your parents wouldn‚Äôt even care if you stayed out late biking with your friends.
 Only because everyone felt so safe, so comfy.
 They don‚Äôt know the half of it.
 But I do.
 I know it all and Starlings is not the place where you want to be after dark.
 The only reason why no one knows this is because Jason, Emily, Seth and I have kept it that way.
 I walked along the empty road alone, occasionally waving to passing kids on bikes.
 My backpack was slung over my shoulder, filled with my writing books and sketchpads.

After he had finished with the mother, he had the guards release the boy who had run over to his sobbing bleeding mother.
 In a fatherly gesture Korin had kissed the boy on the cheek and, wrapping his hands around the boy‚Äôs head in a slow loving gesture, made a quick yank and broke Join‚Äôs neck.
 The next day the guards released the young AElfin widow.
 Rodregas had helped drag her beyond the gates.
 She lay there not moving, limp though alive; she was dead in every way that mattered.
 Rodregas went back into the keep without looking back; he never knew what had happened to her after that.
 After dreaming every night about killing him, Rodregas now had Korin in his grip.
 It was time to end Korin‚Äôs vile pestilence on the world.
 Rodregas got behind him with his right hand covering his mouth, and with his left took a firm grip on the top of his head.
 Rodregas leaned over to his ear and whispered ‚ÄúYou probably don‚Äôt remember, but you killed a boy named Jorin by snapping his neck, and payback is a bitch.‚Äù Snapping a grown man‚Äôs neck is quite hard.

More recent rate increases in the US threaten to halt the declining trend in unemployment observed over the past year.
 The extreme disruption of the centrally planned economies of Eastern Europe during the early stages of their transition to market economies has led to high domestic unemployment in most cases.
 Slow recovery from the recent global recession has restrained the growth of foreign trade.
 Down-sizing by major corporations in response to intense competitive pressures has eliminated many jobs which are not being restored, even after the recession is over.
 Privatization and restructuring of public sector companies in response to fiscal pressures has had a similar effect.
 In the United Kingdom alone, an estimated 500,000 jobs will be lost for this reason in 1994.
 The impact of structural adjustments programmes has slowed economic growth and new job creation in a number of developing countries.
 Gains in productivity due to new technology, particularly delayed gains from the micro-computer revolution of the 1980s and the growth of factory automation, have slowed job growth in some industries.
 The increasing competitiveness of the NIEs of Asia and most recently China has displaced jobs in the West, primarily unskilled jobs.
 The major impact of several of these factors has already been felt and is now beginning to subside.

‚ÄúOr he has done so only to keep himself safe.
 Let me talk to him.

 Velixar shook his head and pointed toward Woodhaven in the far distance.
 ‚ÄúBack there he left you, and I must punish him for such‚Ä¶‚ÄåQurrah, look to the sky.‚Äù
 Qurrah followed Velixar‚Äôs gaze, and there in the distance he saw many white objects faintly illuminated by the stars.
 ‚ÄúAbout a hundred,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúBut what are they?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúElves,‚Äù the man in black said.
 ‚ÄúAnd I know who leads them.

‚ÄúNow,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúlower your center of gravity.
 Bend your legs, but keep them loose.‚Äù She followed his instructions, and he thought this would make her look less striking, but she went from a statuesque dancer to a crouching feline.
 He breathed in through his nose and tried to ignore his newly youthful hormones.
 This time when he pushed her shoulder she went back but did not stumble.
 ‚ÄúSee, you stayed in control.
 You stumble in a fight and you are dead.
 With your center low you have control.
 You are ready to dodge and to strike back as needed.
 Plus, you have leverage.
 If you develop good foot work and keep them moving and you keep your center of gravity low, you can win against stronger but less-disciplined fighters.‚Äù They both nodded, for the moment convinced.

With his superhuman hearing and sense of smell, Alec knew I was struggling before I even did.
 He waited though until I finally admitted how tired I was, and then he scooped me up and effortlessly jogged to the top of the peak.
 "Are all of you shape shifters such showoffs?
 At least the change in altitude should bother you a little."
 Alec smiled as he came to a stop at the very top and set me down.
 I waited for a couple of seconds for him to respond and then shrugged and looked out over the arid, Southern Utah landscape.
 The view literally took my breath away.
 I hadn't realized we were quite so close to Zion National Park with all of its incredible greenery.
 The stark contrast between the desert and the lush vegetation was striking.
 "Not a show off, just really eager to get you up here so I could watch your face when you first saw all of this."

He was not sure what to say but Doi‚Äôvan was.
 ‚ÄúBefore you examine it more, can you come look at what we found?
 And I want to see what might be behind the final wall.‚Äù At that comment Rodregas felt his head turn around as if to look through the Chamber walls to study the forth wall.
 As they stepped out of the door the three of them quickly walked over to the forth wall.
 However, they could find nothing but the black stone of the wall; no door appeared under any fingertips.
 ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ nothing here,‚Äù said Imeralda.
 ‚ÄúWhat did you find earlier?‚Äù she asked.
 ‚ÄúIt is behind that door we have not opened up yet, but it smells of the Infernal Realm,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan said nodding over to the other exposed door.
 ‚ÄúWhat door?
 I see nothing but black stone.‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWe paraded through the city like criminals and were tossed out with swords at our backs.
 If we were to leave, I wanted to leave on our own terms, not like that.‚Äù
 He swore a few times, getting progressively more colorful as he went.
 ‚ÄúTwo minutes alone with that guard,‚Äù he muttered.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôd have him drinking through a brand new hole in his neck.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúHow skilled are you with those?‚Äù Qurrah asked, gesturing at the swords in the grass next to Harruq.
 Even though they lived in such cramped quarters, Qurrah still knew very little of Harruq‚Äôs life other than what he did at his request.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôve watched the guards training new men,‚Äù Harruq said, drawing a blade and holding it with one hand.
 ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôve been practicing every night after you‚Äôre in bed and no one is around to watch and get curious.
 Near the castle they have these stumps for smacking with your sword.

He was our son.
 I was so angry at Brandon at one point that I stood with a hammer over the Chevelle and considered destroying it.
 The Chevelle sitting unfinished in the garage had become a grim symbol of the disappointment I felt with my son.
 Instead, I arranged to have it towed to a friend‚Äôs shop with the agreement that Brandon and I would show up together twice a week and work towards finishing the project with the assistance of a professional (and the expectations of someone other than Dad).
 It didn‚Äôt work to bring Brandon back.
 I warned and warned, but no matter how much I warned him, he continued his journey to the dark side.
 He was over six feet tall and weighed less than 140 pounds.
 He was sickly, late to every family event and completely high when and if he showed up.
 He was a constant embarrassment at large family gatherings as he was the last to show and the first to go.
 When our Chevelle was ready for its maiden voyage, he was a no show.

‚ÄúNothing like home, eh?‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúMove, before the meat spoils,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 The big half-orc stepped out of the way.
 Qurrah came through, carrying a slab of meat in his hands.
 He weaved across the missing planks in the floor and sat next to a small circle of stones.
 Above him was a hole in the ceiling for the smoke to escape.
 ‚ÄúSince when has spoiling meat stopped me from eating it?‚Äù Harruq asked.
 Qurrah laughed.
 ‚ÄúWhich explains so much.‚Äù
 Murmuring a few words, he smashed his hands together.

When she was less happy with me, she tended to focus more on just how stubborn I could be.
 It wasn't always obvious what would set off a bout of 'stiff neck' as she referred to it, but the only people who'd ever successfully talked me into a 'reasonable, rational' response had been Dad and Cindi.
 I could feel that same core of iron making its presence known right now.
 I wasn't going to be deprived of however much time I had left with him.
 I wasn't going to be losing this argument.
 "Alec, I need to be there with you tonight.
 If you leave me here, I'll head out on my own and look for you."
 The shake was definitely there, and getting more pronounced.
 "I'll order Donovan to keep you here."

"Boys.
 You're all the same.
 Okay.
 Assuming my mom takes off for the night, I'll go, but only on the condition that you behave."
 I managed to make it to the door without my knees knocking together, but it was a close thing.
 I'd been scared sick when he'd been about to kiss me, but it had at least been something I'd been dreaming about off and on for years.
 I wasn't sure I was ready for the other things he was starting to imply.
 Chapter 20 There were a couple of times between Monday and the end of the week where I didn't think I was going to survive having to worry about whether or not I'd be able to sneak out to Brandon's party.
 My dreams had taken a decidedly odd turn.
 I'd had the lucid, vivid dreams every single night, but my guilty conscience seemed to be working overtime.

And about three pounds of mud.
 The slower pace gave me time to take everything in.
 The ground had leveled off again, clearing to open meadows of low grass and a few scattered trees.
 Large gray rocks dotted the landscape.
 There was a haziness on the horizon but as we rode it began to clear, revealing a mammoth lake ahead.
 It was a hundred times bigger than the tiny forest ponds I was used to, as smooth as glass.
 Behind it the haze thinned just enough I could see the outline of mountains.
 The image was like a punch in the chest.
 Chevelle rode up beside us.
 ‚ÄúThe hills of Camber.‚Äù I looked at him, my watcher, and thought his features were peaceful for the first time.

 ‚ÄúStay with me.‚Äù I started to pull away and he reached up, placing his hands on either side of my face, feverish now.
 ‚ÄúMarry me, Lizzy.‚Äù I had long since gotten used to the name, but I wasn‚Äôt sure he was talking to me at first.
 It seemed ridiculous.
 I stopped myself from laughing, knowing from previous experience this would hurt him.
 I had come to realize he didn‚Äôt know what I was.
 He knew I was different, of course, knew of the magic, though I‚Äôd shown him nothing of my real power.
 But he didn‚Äôt understand I was an elf.
 I hadn‚Äôt explained, knowing it would do nothing but perplex his simple mind.

Virden shot me one quick look and stormed into his tree.
 Chevelle remained standing where he was, his back to me.
 I had to decide.
 Walk within feet of him going to the library to research him or run home and hide.
 My stomach churned.
 It was ridiculous.
 I took a deep breath and kept walking, approaching the split.
 He turned to me, scarcely a few feet away.
 ‚ÄúGood morning.‚Äù He nodded as he spoke, his voice as smooth as velvet.
 I managed to snap my slack jaw shut at the same moment I realized I had angled my body toward him when he‚Äôd addressed me.

 And keep the promise I made to Art.
 Johnny ‚Äì And what did you promise our father?
 Eugene ‚Äì That I would stay out of trouble.

 Johnny ‚Äì Five dollars says that he‚Äôs arrested by the end of next week.
 Jim ‚Äì You‚Äôre on.
 I‚Äôve seen him avoid getting caught dozens of times over the years.
 Eugene ‚Äì Funny, very funny.
 The only problem with your reasoning is I won‚Äôt be doing anything to bring the law down on me in the first place.

 "Marie, wait."
 He pulled her close, gazing down at her.
 "Are you mad?"
 "No.

 He stroked her hair.
 "I don't want you to go into the garden mad."
 She smiled then.
 "I'm not mad."

I'd expected Mom to put her foot down and tell Brandon I'd be riding the bus to school every morning, starting today.
 Instead, she'd shaken Brandon's hand, smiled way more than usual, and hurried us out the door so we wouldn't be late for school.
 "I don't know what kind of magic you just used on my mom, but whatever it was, you should do it again.
 Heck, use your powers on her every time you stop by.
 That was amazing!"
 Brandon chuckled and reached over to run a finger across my palm.
 "I didn't do anything special.
 Your mom seems like a very sensible person."
 I almost choked.
 "I love my mom, but she's the least sensible person ever.

His other blade stabbed, tearing away the soft flesh beneath his attacker‚Äôs ribcage.
 The elf leapt back, landed shakily, and then lunged once more.
 His speed was not what it should have been, though, and Harruq needed little opening.
 He swung both swords, the entirety of his might behind them.
 The elf blocked.
 His sword was elven-make and had been wielded in his hands for two hundred years.
 Never would he have guessed Harruq‚Äôs were older by three centuries.
 Never would he have guessed that those two blades would shatter his own, pass through the explosion of steel, sever his spine, and cleave his body in two.
 The half-orc continued his charge, engaging the two elves behind.
 They struck as one, their swords aiming for vitals high and low.

Had the greater sigils been gifts to mortals from the Gods themselves?
 Rodregas yearned to reach out and touch to see if they felt like flesh or stone.
 But, to do so would set his path for the rest of his life.
 If he was truly strong enough for two as Imeralda thought, then he could be a lion and what else?
 ‚ÄúWell, Doi‚Äôvan, what do you think?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúI am going to choose lion, but it would be great to have a pride, or maybe the Moon Wolf or the Mountain Bear.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan nodded and walked over to the bear.
 It was a kind of bear that Rodregas had not heard of in the mortal world, even larger than ‚Äòhis‚Äô lion.
 The bear actually had a thick tail and its teeth seemed far larger than any bear he had heard of.
 Doi‚Äôvan stood there looking up at the great beast for a long moment.
 Then he cocked his head; his nose went up as if he smelled something.

In the desert he turned into a pyromaniac, pelted us with fiery sticks and blew one of our sleeping bags to shreds with cherry bombs.
 At last, a few of us chased him off into the night.
 In the morning, we couldn‚Äôt find the long crowbar we had brought for loosing boulders so we could roll them and watch them crash down the hillsides.
 We supposed Tom had stolen the crowbar and sold it to another camper then bummed a ride home.
 That Sunday morning, on the biggest and flattest of all the canyon‚Äôs boulders, Eric stood as though at a pulpit, arms outstretched as in the ‚ÄúJesus body picture‚Äù while he consulted our copy of Zarathustra and recited, ‚Äú‚ÄôMan is something that shall be overcome.
 You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm.
 Once you were apes, and even now man is more ape than any ape.
 Whoever is the wisest among you is also a mere conflict and cross between plant and ghost.
 But do I bid you become ghosts or plants?
 Behold, I teach you the overman, the superman!

From the actions come the habits.
 From the habits comes the character.
 And from the character comes the destiny.‚Äù Stupefied by stress as I was, I sat a while wondering where on that continuum I should start trouble-shooting, until the obvious made itself clear.
 Start with the spirit.
 So, I thought, what could best set my spirit on the right path?
 I believe it was God who sent the message: "Look here, you're a writer.
 But for months you haven't been writing, which has grieved your spirit into a coma.
 Sure, teaching nine classes and raising kids is hard, but it‚Äôs not going to kill you.
 What will kill you is not writing.‚Äù The next morning, I got up at 5 a.m. instead of 5:30, which allowed me to write for a half hour.
 Not much, but enough to give me hope, which is the antidote to despair.

He tilted her chin up, wiping away her tears.
 "Won't you consider staying here with me?
 Marrying me?"
 Her throat tightened, and she pulled her chin free, shaking her head.
 "I can't."
 She gripped his hands.
 "It's like a lifeline.
 I love you, and I love 2011, but if I let go of my home, I'd be lost."
 Rick reached into his pocket, taking out his handkerchief and handing it to her.
 She started to wipe her face with it but then stopped.

I didn't particularly approve of him, but I wasn't going to get really vocal about it.
 Not when he was your first boyfriend.

 I didn't have to pretend to be hurt and disappointed.
 Even knowing that Alec was everything I'd thought Brandon was, I still felt used and disappointed.
 "I just wasn't what he was looking for.
 He made it very clear the last time I saw him."
 Mom crossed the distance from the window and wrapped her arms around me.
 "Teenage boys are so cruel.

 And we fucked that first night in my little Toyota.

 Frost beasts are the cutest monsters you‚Äôll ever see.

 Don‚Äôt let them breath on you, or you‚Äôll freeze to death.

 I drew a single arrow and aimed it at its throat.
 I didn‚Äôt want to kill it, but I knew if I didn‚Äôt, it would kill me without a second thought.

The complete elimination of these barriers could result in a doubling of textile exports by developing countries.
 This labour-intensive industry can be another engine for job creation in developing countries and rising demand for technology and capital goods from the industrial nations.
 The progressive reduction, leading to the eventual elimination, of barriers to trade in agricultural products and textiles is an important step that can substantially improve the employment opportunities of people in developing countries.
 5.Improve access to markets: The most important structural change in the world economy over the past 35 years has been the five-fold increase in the world share of manu factured exports gained by the developing countries as a group, up from 4 per cent to 19 per cent, compared with a current market share of about 13 per cent each of the United States and for Japan.
 Although 54 per cent of these manufactures come from five top exporting countries, a large number of countries export more than $1 billion in this category annually.
 This has opened the door for self-reliant growth in many developing countries.
 This growth could have been considerably more impressive but for constraints placed on it by both tariff and, particularly, non-tariff barriers.
 The latter have proliferated in recent decades and affected almost half of OECD imports during the 1980s.
 By the end of 1990, there were more than 200 export-constraint arrangements involving product groups of impor tance to developing countries.
 The incidence of anti-dumping cases against developing countries rose substantially in the late 1980s.

 He covered her hand with his, smiling.

 She turned it and let go as soon as she heard a noise.
 But then the noise stopped.
 The second time she held the key longer, jerking her hand away when she heard a grinding sound.
 "What did I do?"
 "You kept the key turned too long.
 It's OK--you'll get the feel of it.

But it is equally true that ‚Äòshock therapy‚Äô never could have been implemented by a democratic government, when it imposed such enormous hardship on the people and generated a polarization and fragmentation of political forces within the country.
 Where similar strategies have succeeded in other parts of the world, it has usually been under authoritarian governments, such as in Chile.
 Where force is not possible, the only viable alternative is to build social consensus in support of the reform strategy.
 Ultimately, the success of the reform measures will be determined by one factor ‚Äì the extent to which the people understand, accept and are motivated to act under the new system.
 Before introducing any new measure, maximum effort should be made to communicate its purpose and nature to the people and win their understanding and approval.
 Public education is the most powerful policy instrument.
 With public opinion widely divided over the best course of action, it is necessary to win back the understanding, support and endorsement of the population for an alternative programme which the major parties and social groups can back.
 This requires educating the public to understand both the costs and benefits involved in any reform strategy, the trade-offs between immediate advantages and immediate sacrifices required to establish a new and stable equilibrium.
 3.Economic strategy must be balanced: A market economy can be introduced gradually or step-wise, but it cannot be introduced in a fragmentary or piecemeal manner.
 Deregulation of prices was the most prominent feature of the strategy in most countries, because it was the easiest to implement.

Alec took my hand as Donovan opened the front door for us.
 He walked with a definite limp, one that was all the more painful when contrasted against his otherwise graceful movements.
 I looked questioningly at Alec, but he shook his head, so I stayed quiet as he led me into the house.
 Rachel was waiting for us in a luxuriously-furnished sitting room.
 "Mother's been asking for you, Alec.
 I told her you'd be back soon, but she's worried."
 "I suppose this is a good opportunity to introduce Adriana."
 For the first time since I'd found out about Alec's secret, Rachel was looking uncertain.
 She was suddenly the old Rachel I knew from school instead of the confident young woman who'd helped face down three terrifying shape shifters intent on sending me back to Brandon.
 "Are you sure, Alec?

‚ÄúYes, well, I guess I should start practicing.‚Äù Heat brushed my skin as the fire Chevelle was building flared.
 It returned to its proper size and Chevelle commanded, ‚ÄúSit, Elfreda.‚Äù Steed followed as I walked to a fallen limb by the fire and settled atop the widest part, drawing my legs up from the ground.
 He sat as well, apparently not concerned about who was finding us breakfast.
 Irritation rolled off Chevelle as he ran into the thick line of trees that bordered the clearing.
 In only a moment he was back, carrying three large, white birds.
 ‚ÄúWhere is your bow?‚Äù I asked.
 Steed‚Äôs laugh was loud.
 ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a hoot!‚Äù Chevelle looked as though he could be in danger of losing his temper.
 I didn‚Äôt get the joke.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre serious?‚Äù Steed said, humor vanished as he gaped at Chevelle.

 He raised his sword to block Seth‚Äôs blow.

We spent the rest of lunch pacing around the outside of the school while he worked through whatever was bothering him.
 When the warning bell finally rang, he turned and looked at me with a considering smile.
 We stood like that for a good thirty seconds before he reached a single finger up and traced the left side of my face as he leaned in slightly.
 It was simultaneously the scariest and most exciting thing I'd ever experienced.
 Even as I leaned in a little bit myself, my thundering heart seemed to be trying to leap out of my throat solely for the purpose of disrupting what looked very much like it was going to be my first kiss.
 Every tiny hair on my body stood up in a shiver of nervousness as he tilted his head to the side, and then he broke off, shaking himself slightly as he gave me a smile.
 For a second I thought he was rejecting me, that he'd decided not to kiss me because he wasn't interested.
 Only the way he reached out for my hand indicated that he really wasn't repulsed by me.
 It bothered me the entire time I was in History, and then just before I got to Physics it hit me.
 He hadn't stopped because he didn't want to kiss me.

A few days later, Eric and Kenny got expelled for having been intoxicated on school grounds.
 Mrs. Hazel Bole, our vice principal, summoned Billy and me.
 She was a big woman, in size and spirit, a person of understanding and compassion, who tried hard to prepare us seniors for the real world.
 She said, ‚ÄúI know you two were with Eric and Kenny.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo expel me,‚Äù I said.
 ‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù Billy said.
 She shook her head.
 ‚ÄúYou probably think I could keep Eric and Kenny in school, but here‚Äôs the way things are.
 Once the police get involved, the school board has to expel.
 That‚Äôs policy.
 Otherwise, they won‚Äôt usually expel, for fear a parent will sue them.

Someone like him.
 I tried to respond to his greeting, but felt choked and instead only nodded back, my mouth tight as I endeavored to grin with a now clenched jaw.
 I groaned internally, keeping on the path, not daring to look back in case he was behind me.
 I was convinced he was.
 He wouldn‚Äôt be taking the back way to Junnie‚Äôs as I had come, and he wouldn‚Äôt be leaving the village without a pack; he was likely going to a Council meeting.
 Yes, he was certainly right behind me, following me into town.
 Somehow I made it to the library without tripping or looking back, though I was nearly overcome with the temptation to turn at the door to see him one more time.
 The library steps curled around the interior of the tree, shelves cut into every space above and below, tables and racks and patrons scattered about the remaining areas.
 I found a dark, empty corner on the third level and relaxed onto a seat, leaning against the inside wall of the old tree and taking in the scent of ancient paper and binding.
 After a momentary pause to blot out the latest incident of poor self-control, I decided to attempt to locate the missing pages by magic.

 ‚ÄúHow come you get some random power when the rest of us don't?‚Äù He gave me a fake pout.
 ‚ÄúIt's not fair.‚Äù I leaned against the tree next to him and rammed my elbow into his side.
 He winced and I grinned.
 ‚ÄúI didn't ask for the power, Seth.
 But it did save our butts so I'm happy, I magically gained it.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell I hope I get some cool power too,‚Äù Emily said and stretched.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre back.‚Äù His voice was trembling, feeble.
 It was my Noble, young no more.
 He had been waiting here for my return.
 He was an outcast of the village; no one believed his tales of magic, the mysterious woman he claimed to meet here.
 He confessed to spending years trying to find me.
 He‚Äôd thought I was angry with him and that was why I‚Äôd not returned.
 He was afraid to leave this spot in case I were to change my mind, forgive him for whatever he‚Äôd done.
 I pushed the guilt aside when I recalled why I‚Äôd had to come here.
 For my Freya, to save her.
 What my father had done to me, to my mother, I would not let him do to her.

The staff cracked against Harruq‚Äôs forehead.
 He staggered backward, his eyes going wide and blank.
 ‚ÄúYou could fell an ogre with that hit,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúVery funny,‚Äù Aurelia said.
 She smiled.
 ‚ÄúThat was my first good hit of the day.
 Mind if we make it the last?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doomed,‚Äù Harruq said, ignoring her.
 ‚ÄúOh, the agony.
 What a way to die.‚Äù He collapsed, his arms splayed wide and his tongue hanging out of his mouth.

It was the same dream, but different now.
 I glanced around to find a village I didn‚Äôt know.
 Someone was coming toward me, an expression of fear and sadness on his handsome face.
 His familiar face.
 He reached out to me and I stepped toward him, tears streaming down my cheeks.
 He wrapped his arms around me as I turned again to see my mother.
 A howl of rage escaped her and I started to go to her, but he held me.
 He was restraining me.
 I thrashed against him as I tried to scream, to tell him to let me go, but I had no voice.
 She reached her hand out and I could not move, could not help her, though I knew she was dying.

That first night Buddy went home with her.
 What happened there is shrouded in mystery, except Skippy recalls Buddy saying, ‚ÄúShe had the most beautiful sex I‚Äôve ever seen.
 It tasted like mushrooms and ginger ale.
 And its musk stayed on me for days, like it had gone subcutaneous, like it had replaced my own body odor.‚Äù Perhaps this was her hex: Ruthah: The perfume of Immortality.
 Others talk about the size and welcoming essence of Lorelei‚Äôs breasts.
 Buddy was mothered; he fed there like a suckling, like a child.
 It wasn‚Äôt love but it was something between the sacred and the profane.
 Some say Lorelei was responsible for the beginning of the slide downward for Buddy, filling his head with ideas of stardom, of leaving the backwash of Memphis and making it in a real town like L.A. or Boston.
 Buddy listened to Lorelei, we know that, for better or worse.
 Let‚Äôs hearken back to a happier image.

But now you aren‚Äôt going to marry him.
 And-and the article changed.‚Äù ‚ÄúChanged?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù  He raked his fingers through his hair again.
 ‚ÄúI read it again after you came here, and it had changed.
 Now it just gives general information about your family and your birth.
 It doesn‚Äôt mention your death or-or anything about marriage or children.‚Äù  He paused.
 ‚ÄúI thought that maybe .
 .
 .
 maybe that‚Äôs because coming here would change all that.‚Äù She blinked, trying to absorb what he was telling her.
 Her life was already on record?

I left a sleeping Rune just in time to find my sister sneaking from the castle.
 I followed her all the way to her secret spot.
 It took us half the day to get there, but it was worth it.
 It‚Äôs so far away from any kind of traffic, I have no idea how she even discovered it.
 Nestled in a patch of trees outside the forest was some sort of camp.
 I watched her at first.
 She scoured the area searching through the things she found there.
 But I couldn‚Äôt observe for long.
 I revealed myself and inquired about her previous finds and all the questions that were plaguing me.
 She was furious!

 Qurrah knelt and accepted the gifts.
 ‚ÄúThe vials contain powerful healing elixirs.

She added the last bullet; Toad Dwarf said to Jason, ‚ÄúHe will destroy all half-ling.‚Äù What does ‚Äúhalf-ling mean?
 ‚ÄúDid the dwarfs tell you anything?‚Äù I asked, taking the paper.
 None of what she wrote on the paper made any sense to me.
 She shook her head.
 ‚ÄúNo and if they did, I was too busy trying to burn them to hear them.‚Äù She took the paper back.
 ‚ÄúWell I think the only thing we‚Äôve established is that toad dwarves are crazy.‚Äù Seth said.
 I noticed a thin, red line on his cheek where a thrasher must have scratched him.
 Emily wagged her finger at him.
 ‚ÄúNever dis facts.
 They might save you later in life.‚Äù Seth just snorted.

‚ÄúWhy always the face?‚Äù I yelled at his back.
 I winced as a second branch, this one young and green and more like a lash, struck me from behind.
 A fierce growl escaped me and I took off, running at full speed in the direction my horse had gone.
 By midday, I was completely spent.
 I had eventually caught my horse, but the training hadn‚Äôt let up.
 I was too exhausted for any anger to remain, but I had the sneaking suspicion Chevelle was enjoying my ‚Äúlessons.‚Äù We stopped by a patch of snow that had gathered in a rock basin, warming it to water for the horses.
 Chevelle jumped down from his horse as I melted off the side of mine and onto a rock, my limbs like molasses.
 He came to sit across from me and I flinched, expecting another attack.
 He smiled.
 ‚ÄúWell, at least you‚Äôre anticipating assault.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt have the energy for casual banter, but I did manage to glare at him.

 The cloaked man reached across the fire.
 His fingers brushed Qurrah‚Äôs pale face.
 Sudden, awful pain pierced his skull.
 Visions flowed through those fingers, dominant and brutal.
 _Qurrah marched through a burning city commanding a legion of walking dead.
 Screams of men and women sang a constant chorus, and in the distance, a castle crumbled to stone and dust.
 A demonic chant filled his ears, two words repeated again and again.
 It was a warcry against all life._

This process has led to enormous growth in new jobs.
 The best documented example of this process is the automotive industry.
 Inspired by the idea of making a car the working-class masses at the turn of the century could afford, Henry Ford adopted new manufacturing technology, the automated assembly line, to produce the first low-priced automobile.
 Ford‚Äôs technology increased worker productivity more than seven-fold and reduced production costs by two-thirds.
 As an immediate result, thousands of small manufacturers of custom-built cars and horse-drawn carriages were put out of business.
 But the growing demand for low-cost vehicles generated explosive growth for the industry, creating tens of thousands of new jobs in the process.
 Globally, production rose from less than 250,000 vehicles in 1910 to 42 million in 1980.
 Nine decades later, the automotive industry is still the largest manufacturing industry in the world and the single largest source of jobs in the American economy.
 Every job created in automotive manufacturing has spawned roughly ten more in related occupations.
 Thus, about 9 per cent of the USA‚Äôs entire workforce is employed in occupations directly related to automotive manufacture, sales and services, road construction and maintenance, and transport of freight and passengers.

 The woman ran faster and her child cried louder.
 It didn‚Äôt matter.
 Harruq rammed her with his shoulder.
 To protect her child, the woman rolled so that her side took the brunt of the fall.
 As the half-orc‚Äôs blades twirled in the air, the mother kissed her child one last time before curling up around the joy of her life.
 Then the blades fell.
 On the half-orc ran.
 Innocent blood stained his sword as life after life ended.
 Harruq felt no remorse and saw no pain.

I expected him to look at me like I was mad.
 Instead, he looked like it was‚Ä¶ endearing.
 He stood and walked over to me, taking my hand to help me up.
 When he touched me, I tried to fight the heat that ran up my neck.
 I couldn‚Äôt and embarrassment caused my cheeks to color as well.
 I peered up at him through my now-dark bangs and could have sworn it amused him.
 I laughed at myself.
 The silly romance I‚Äôd been reading in the diary must have been affecting me.
 I tried to stop my thoughts from returning there as we practiced, but it was near impossible.
 He kept working close with me, touching me.

 Something about that last thought didn‚Äôt seem right, like it wasn‚Äôt mine, but I couldn‚Äôt follow it.
 The tracker screamed; it had reached his thigh.
 My eyes flicked open.
 The body of the snake made a lump under the skin of the tracker‚Äôs leg.
 His face was contorted in agony, but that wasn‚Äôt what had done it.
 It was the fear.

"Thanks, but I have some studying to do.
 I'd better just find a quiet corner."
 The smile I received was sickly sweet, but left me with the impression I'd just failed a test.
 "Okay, we'll see you another day then?"
 I pulled out my Spanish and Biology books, more because they were the two subjects I was doing the worst in than out of any real desire to study them, and wandered the halls until Mr. Whethers took pity on me and asked if I wanted to study in his classroom.
 Sitting there all by myself felt so lonely.
 When you boiled it all down, I had a grand total of two friends in Sanctuary.
 Rachel and Brandon, both of who seemed to dislike the other, and neither of whom I was really sure I could count on.
 It was fine to only have two friends, or even just one friend if you knew they would do everything they possibly could to make sure they wouldn't let you down.
 It was entirely different when you weren't sure you could trust the people around you.

Rodregas kept his focus on the bear; he knew that lionesses in prides do most of the hunting and the alpha males simply ate after the kill was done.
 He started to cut away a large chunk of the bear‚Äôs haunch to take back to the barn for their dinner.
 One of the lionesses growled and bit down on the haunch not far from him.
 His heart stopped for a moment.
 Rodregas thought she was going to take his hand for a second.
 With his free hand he made a fist and slammed the side of her head.
 Not with all his strength, but still a serious hit.
 She grunted and let go, growled and stepped over the bear‚Äôs body.
 He slowly reached up, and using the full strength of his body, pushed hard on her muscular chest, pushing her away from the bear‚Äôs haunch.
 He then ignored her and went back to cutting the haunch loose.

Fine, but don't come crying back to me when the mask comes off."
 Alec abruptly released me and stalked off.
 He was moving so incredibly quickly he'd disappeared around a corner with one balled-up fist pressed against his side before I'd even started shaking in fear.
 I'd never before been that helpless.
 Had he wanted to, I had no doubt but that he could have easily snapped my neck.
 He was that strong.
 I really was trembling now.
 I wanted to mutter something about overzealous body-builders lifting just to intimidate people, but couldn't get the words out.
 I think maybe I was afraid he'd overhear and return to finish the job.
 My shoulders felt like the skin was on fire, but I knew it was just my imagination.

It seemed all the forest paused, listening for the answer.
 ‚ÄúHarruq, I love you.
 But I also love my home.
 I love my brethren.‚Äù
 She stood on her toes and gave him a quick, soft kiss on his lips.
 A tear ran down Harruq‚Äôs cheek as he stood in shock.
 His mind relished the soft feel of her lips on his, the scent of flowers, and the subtle fire that had escaped onto his tongue.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you tomorrow,‚Äù she said, taking a hesitant step toward the trees.
 ‚ÄúSure thing,‚Äù Harruq said, rubbing the tear off his cheek and pretending it had not been there.
 Aurelia smiled.

That was all he could say to her when he hadn't seen her for the past five weeks?
 "Fine, Davis.
 I've been fine."
 Freeing her hand, she moved away from him and retrieved her tea.
 The warm family atmosphere was suddenly replaced by an awkwardness that was only relieved by a lively business discussion among the three men.
 Marie caught her mother's glance, and the two ladies went to the kitchen to get some pastries and coffee.
 "Don't worry, Marie--the two of you just need some time alone together to talk."
 "No."
 Marie shook her head.
 "I'm not going to marry him."

Lunch passed all too quickly.
 Before I knew it we were back at Britney's locker and she was promising to give me a ride home from school after Spanish.
 History was about as dry as I'd expected, which was really too bad.
 I'd had a good history teacher in junior high, and it was an incredibly interesting subject when taught right.
 Unfortunately Mr. Simms was possibly the worst teacher I'd ever had.
 I mentally shrugged when we were told to open our books and read the chapter to ourselves.
 At least I wouldn't have any worries when it came to catching up in this class.
 Thoughts of Brandon made it hard to really get into the chapter.
 Also, it was hard not to notice the borderline hostile stares from the other kids.
 I sighed in relief when the bell rang, and pulled out my schedule and map to see where I'd be going next.

All of a sudden, Emily walked towards the dragon.
 Seth yelled at her to get back but she ignored him.
 She stood right in front of its head and opened her mouth, bizarre sounds started coming out.
 We all stood there mesmerized as she grunted, growled, snorted and hissed at the dragon.
 I expected it to just take a huge bite out of her, but it seemed as surprised as we were.
 ‚ÄúEmily, what's going on?‚Äù I shouted to her and started to walk over.
 Seth reached out and grabbed my arm.
 I spun around, suddenly annoyed.
 He shook his head and nodded over to the dragon.
 I looked and to my surprise it was bending down to let Emily stroke its head.

And not just him.
 The entire village must have known I was bound, known I couldn‚Äôt perform magic, as they sat and watched me try.
 Sending me to Junnie for lessons, allowing Evelyn to taunt me without recourse, giving me the blame for everything that happened.
 Because they expected me to turn.
 The horses slowed to a stop, irritating me further.
 I didn‚Äôt even have control over that.
 Chevelle stepped down and started a fire.
 When he walked away, I recalled what he had said earlier in the day, that you could stop someone‚Äôs heart.
 It hadn‚Äôt occurred to me that might be how he killed his prey.
 He made his way back over the scrubby brush, two small rabbits in hand.

However, this time, instead of Ravenhurr, his old guard sergeant had ended up as a new powerful Immortalist.
 As the cold of the stone chilled his back Rodregas thought about his promise to the Celestial Gods that if he were able to kill Ravenhurr and live, then his new duty would be to fight the Immortalists.
 When all and everyone else had failed him over the years, only his duty had kept Rodregas alive.
 He no longer knew what to do without it.
 His back straightened and he pulled away from the wall that he had slumped against.
 Rodregas lived instead of the man whose body he now lived in.
 He had seen the tragedy of gifted person after gifted person be torn asunder by the Immortalists.
 He hated the Immortalists for their casual destruction and use of people.
 Could he now live in one of these stolen bodies, unless he had a reason?
 The Immortalists and their Guild were evil and needed to be opposed.

Accelera ting the development of poorer nations and poorer sections of the population in each country is the most powerful instrument and the surest guarantee of continued growth of jobs and incomes for everyone in the next century.
 Strategies for Developing Countries
 For the developing countries as a whole, the most critical question is how to create quickly hundreds of millions of jobs for the poor with limited purchasing power and limited capital for investment.
 The idea that most of these jobs could be created in the corporate sector or by government-sponsored activities has been put to rest.
 Currently, there are nearly one billion self-employed and unpaid family workers in the world, most of them self-employed farmers in developing countries.
 The self-employed represent 48 per cent of the workforce in low-income economies (less than $500 per capita GDP).
 For any strategy to be successful, it must give central importance to self-employment and entrepreneurship, with emphasis on agriculture, agro-industry and small firms in the informal sector.
 While a single approach will not be applicable to countries and regions of the world in different stages of development, a number of common principles and strategies are widely applicable.
 Agriculture as an engine
 Slightly more than half the world‚Äôs workforce, of whom 30 per cent are women, are still engaged in agriculture.

At some point I transitioned from just crying to having a full-blown panic attack.
 It should've terrified me that something new was bringing on an episode, but it was like there was so much else going wrong I couldn't spare any more emotional energy.
 I came out of the attack and remained on the floor thinking about all of the good times I'd had with Dad and Cindi.
 The memories should have made me feel better, but they had the opposite effect.
 I felt the tears start again as I realized all that goodness and joy was gone from my life forever.
 As my immunity started to wear off, I gratefully surrendered to the next attack, and the blissful relief it represented.
 I knew I was on track to drop back into the funk that'd robbed me of the weeks immediately after they died, but I was still strangely numb in the parts that should have cared.
 It seemed like I was on my third iteration, but it might have been the fourth or fifth.
 I was too detached to care.
 The knock on the door at least brought me back to myself enough to wonder how long I'd been on the floor.

They certainly don‚Äôt have a book that can teach you how to be a good father and my own experiences as a son and a stepson had only given me insight on what not to do as a father.
 Even if this magical book did exist that could help you raise the perfect child, I assume that the chapter titled, ‚ÄúHow to Do a Drug Bust for Your Son‚Äù would be absent.
 I knew Brandon couldn‚Äôt do this because he was too hot on the streets as a snitch.
 I pressed the issue, which was met with emphatic refusals each time.
 The officers continued to hold their ground and refused to agree to work with me.
 I pushed: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to work with me.
 I just want to know what you would do if I contacted you and told you that Steve was meeting me to buy one-hundred Oxys?
 What is your job responsibility in that case?‚Äù ‚ÄúWe would do our job if someone called and informed us of a drug deal,‚Äù Officer White said.
 ‚ÄúIf I am able to get Steve busted, would that count for my son‚Äôs deal?‚Äù I asked.
 The officer and his sergeant left the room for about ten minutes before returning to tell me that it would.

BG: 	In a manner of speaking.
 Yeah.
 Lorelei is always there to keep me straight.
 God is me, in me, you know?
 That‚Äôs what she‚Äôs saying.
 That‚Äôs what she‚Äôs always been saying, but people couldn‚Äôt hear her, for whatever reason.
 They wouldn‚Äôt listen.
 Just like I say in ‚ÄúBurn my Bridge‚Äù, you know?
 ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a black and white photograph/On my finger is a tiny bird.‚Äù  You know?
 It‚Äôs like they can‚Äôt hear me now, after they all were so intent on being Black Lung acolytes, or whatever.

‚ÄúThis was all a trap!‚Äù The dwarf's eyes widened in alarm, ‚ÄúI swear, sir, that I knew nothing of this!
 I warned you that you must be prepared for anything.‚Äù ‚ÄúSeth,‚Äù I said slowly, placing a hand on his shoulder, ‚ÄúDon't attack him, we need him to help us get through Igneeria.‚Äù I felt his shoulder muscle tense under my fingers but he lowered his blade.
 He didn't sheath it though, because he would need it in the fight.
 He glowered at the dwarf, ‚ÄúDon't think that I trust you, dwarf,‚Äù he said angrily.
 ‚ÄúYou're only alive because Jazell makes a good point.
 But if I find that you are lying to us,‚Äù he sliced the air, ‚ÄúYou're going to have a lot more problems than you think.‚Äù The dwarf gulped and looked away.
 I gripped Seth's shoulder and he turned around to face me.
 I saw distrust flash in his eyes but he gave me a weak smile.
 We turned to face the monsters heading for us.
 Seth charged ahead, slicing Thrashers and Frost Beasts.

It‚Äôs a small quiet town, the kind where everyone knows your name.
 It‚Äôs a place where your parents wouldn‚Äôt even care if you stayed out late biking with your friends.
 Only because everyone felt so safe, so comfy.
 They don‚Äôt know the half of it.
 But I do.
 I know it all and Starlings is not the place where you want to be after dark.
 The only reason why no one knows this is because Jason, Emily, Seth and I have kept it that way.
 I walked along the empty road alone, occasionally waving to passing kids on bikes.
 My backpack was slung over my shoulder, filled with my writing books and sketchpads.
 I kept my eyes on the shadowed road, watching my every step.

Well, I've managed to get to the bottom of the situation and it appears we did indeed award the contract to her."
 The news seemed too good to be true.
 "You mean she's got the job?"
 "Technically it isn't an employment offer.
 It's more in the way of a consulting project, but yes, she'll be in a sense working for the city.
 I've asked my staff to make sure that the confusion is cleared up with the bank as well so you shouldn't be in any kind of danger of losing your house anymore."
 I almost clapped for joy, only there was something off about it all.
 Since when did the mayor personally come to deliver a piece of relatively insignificant news?
 Not only that, why would he be so shaken up?
 He'd actually seemed to be trying to determine whether or not it would be okay to just leave a message.

I threw him into his own consuming flames.
 The other two I did not meet until afterwards.‚Äù At Rodregas‚Äô response Van‚Äôdret stared at him, ‚ÄúYou killed an Immortalist Sorcerer by yourself in his tower?
 You truly claim that?‚Äù Rodregas almost laughed.
 He did chuckle a bit as he said, ‚ÄúFirst, you want me to admit that I killed an Immortalist Sorcerer, and when I do, you don‚Äôt believe me.
 An old soldier like me just can‚Äôt win.‚Äù Van‚Äôdret was too smart not to pick up his hint, ‚ÄúAn old soldier?‚Äù he asked very quietly.
 ‚ÄúMy turn to ask a question,‚Äù said Rodregas.
 ‚ÄúHow did you connect the three of us to these crimes?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret shrugged and smiled and said, ‚ÄúTo be honest, I did not really think you were the ones.
 I simply did not like you, and the way you hung out with non-Celestials.
 It is unnatural.
 Now, it is my turn to ask a question.‚Äù ‚ÄúActually,‚Äù interrupted Rodregas, ‚Äúyou already asked me about being an old soldier.

I remembered the tree and was suddenly afraid for him.
 Would Anvil use the same method on a person?
 A thunderous crack answered my unspoken question.
 The lightning bolt was faster than my eyes at such a close distance, by the time I looked at Steed, there was nothing but a wall of water.
 He had constructed a barrier of sorts, caught the strike and redirected it around himself by melting the snow that spotted the mountain.
 Anvil was winded, though the strike wasn‚Äôt as severe as his previous show.
 Steed would unquestionably be the winner now and as he took aim to retaliate, his opponent raised his hands in surrender.
 ‚ÄúQuick thinking, Mister Summit.‚Äù The large man grinned and I was in no doubt they were old friends.
 Chevelle stepped forward then, eager.
 I had a feeling he‚Äôd been itching for this the way I‚Äôd been itching to burn Ruby.

I jumped a little at the surprise.
 "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."
 I shrugged as my breathing started to slow down again.
 "It's okay.
 Where were you?"
 "Scouting.
 We had to make sure Brandon's pack wasn't waiting for us."
 "How can you be sure?
 They could be hidden anywhere."
 Alec shook his head, his eyes strangely gentle.

Both bowed politely.
 ‚ÄúNever could we have used a mage‚Äôs power more than now,‚Äù one said.
 Aurelia blushed and waved him off.
 ‚ÄúPlease we must‚Ä¶‚Äù
 A cold chill spread through her body, like water from an underground stream meeting a creek.
 She whirled and stared down the street.
 Walking without escort was a lone man shrouded in black robes.
 The cowl of his cloak hid much of his face.
 ‚ÄúCome, brother,‚Äù one of the elves said.
 ‚ÄúIt is the one who protected them from our arrows.‚Äù

My mouth tingled.
 ‚ÄúA little fairy dust.
 Breath of the siren.‚Äù ‚ÄúWha‚Äô?‚Äù My tongue was thick.
 Steed chuckled.
 ‚ÄúIntoxicating, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù I could hear the smile in his voice.
 My nose tingled and I scrunched it up, giggling at the feeling.
 I shook my head, trying to clear it.
 ‚ÄúFairy breath?‚Äù ‚ÄúRed.

"Ah, there you two are.
 Britney, you'll be sitting over there from now on.
 Adriana, go ahead and get started on your homework.
 When you finish come find me and we'll get you situated."
 As always, Rachel was sitting at her table in the middle of no-man's-land.
 She looked up at me and smiled as I took my usual spot and started on my homework.
 For the first time all day I felt like I could relax.
 The few times I looked up, I saw Britney, who seemed determined not to give in and actually do her homework.
 I finished my two assignments about the time I normally did, and walked over to where Mrs. Campbell was trying to explain a story problem.
 The sophomore she was helping looked like he wanted to be anywhere other than trying to figure out how long it would take Sally to mow the lawn given a certain width of lawn mower moving at a given rate of speed.

He saw a city burning, people fleeing in the streets, and then he saw himself dressed in black armor that oozed power.
 Salvation and Condemnation waved high above his head, both drenched in blood.
 He looked like a god among men, and the way the soldiers fell at his feet made him think he might have been one.
 This red-dream self looked straight at him and spoke, but Harruq could not understand the words.
 The sound of his own voice chilled him, though, for it was dark, it was dangerous, and it was exactly like Velixar‚Äôs.
 _A god among men,_ said a second voice, one he had never heard before.
 It was darker than any shade that haunted his nightmares.
 There was only one it could be, and it was no mortal.
 _Protect your brother, and I will grant you a kingdom.
 Live as you have always lived, and I will reward you with eternity.

It was a pale shadow of what it felt like to lose a family member, but it was made up of too many of the same elements.
 One of the chaperons, an over-bleached woman who looked like she was struggling to deny her last eight or nine birthdays, had to call my name at least twice to shake me out of my funk.
 I followed everyone else out to the bus, but there wasn't any refuge there.
 I was just too different from everyone else.
 Hour after hour passed in silent misery, until finally the rest of the kids wore themselves out and it quieted down enough for me to lapse into a fitful sleep.
 I was smack-dab in the middle of a dream about Rachel and Britney when everything changed.
 Ever so slowly, the normal dreamscape took on a sharp-edged glow, and then morphed into the breathtaking colors that'd wormed their way even deeper into my heart than I'd realized.
 I didn't recognize my surroundings, but they were different than any of the places I'd been before.
 The new scents whipping past me on the breeze were sign enough even if I hadn't been able to detect the subtle differences in the light emanating off of the foliage paving the trail I was walking along.
 For the length of the dream I lost myself in the wonder of experiencing the world in all of its amazing depth.

Once I was near it, I closed my eyes and the wind picked back up.
 My body felt hot and cold simultaneously as I returned.
 I reopened my eyes and stood up, stretched, and grabbed my bag.
 My back sent a chorus of cracks cascading upwards as I straightened myself.
 I raised the side of my shirt to find the thin, red scratch marks.
 Any injuries I get in my hunter form I have when I become human again, just not as severe.
 I quickly ran my fingers over the darker, thicker marks on my shin, the skin sore and purple.
 I quickly checked myself for any other injures I might have acquired from my tangle with the Thrasher, but all I found was a bunch of bruises.
 Seth seemed to have disappeared, so I trudged down the road to my house.
 It‚Äôs cozy familiar blue paint and white shutters helped to relax me as I pushed open the door.

Bed time?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúSleep if you must,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúI will join you in a bit.‚Äù
 Harruq removed his armor, lay down on the bed of straw, and slept.
 The necromancer stepped outside his home, walked to the side, and stared at the flickering lights in the distance.
 Campfires and torches.
 An army, the same that had removed him and his brother from their home, slept so close.
 Every one of them contemplated their death.
 Qurrah closed his eyes and inhaled the cold night air.
 Yes, the tension was delectable.

The three walked as one to the Celestial Lion.
 They looked first at the great beast and then at Rodregas.
 ‚ÄúAre you sure I have the magical strength to take on two greater sigils?‚Äù he asked Imeralda.
 ‚ÄúFew have such strength; taking a second greater sigil seems to consume far more power than one.
 It is not just twice as much, but far more.
 Only the most powerful have such magic, but you have the power of an Immortalist mage.
 I can‚Äôt promise it, but you should have such magical strength.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda watched silently as he reached out to touch the Celestial Lion, his hand again drawn to its mane.
 This time no voice spoke up to warn him away.
 The fur of the mane was surprisingly rough to the touch, and strangely, Rodregas smelled grass.

And Debbie, well, she was just so young and lovely.
 The first time she took my cock out was in her backyard, leaning against her house, her mother moving around in the kitchen right over our heads‚Äîthis is what you did back then.
 Were parents oblivious?
 I don‚Äôt know.
 Anyway, she takes it out---and this is like the first time either of us has bared anything except our souls and she was just fascinated with it.
 And I don‚Äôt know where this knowledge comes from but she knew immediately how to do what needed to be done.
 She was jerking on me so expertly‚Äîwell, hell, maybe anything feels right the first time‚Äîand, very quickly‚ÄîI was young---I squirted all over both of us.
 It was a surprise.
 I don‚Äôt know what she expected to happen but there was this like fountain, as if I had stored it up for a decade, and there was some on her hand, her forearm, her shirt.
 And the look on her face (laughs) well, let‚Äôs just say, it was obvious that it was not what she expected.

I'd never before been that helpless.
 Had he wanted to, I had no doubt but that he could have easily snapped my neck.
 He was that strong.
 I really was trembling now.
 I wanted to mutter something about overzealous body-builders lifting just to intimidate people, but couldn't get the words out.
 I think maybe I was afraid he'd overhear and return to finish the job.
 My shoulders felt like the skin was on fire, but I knew it was just my imagination.
 His grip had been rock-hard, but he hadn't actually squeezed enough to hurt me.
 He'd shown pretty good control for someone who'd just been spanked in a debate, and obviously wanted to rip my head off.
 Turning around to return to the tutor room, I almost tripped over my own feet when I saw Britney standing just outside the closed door.

She and Davis were going to have to have a serious discussion.
 She didn't intend to have a husband whom she saw only at meals and at bedtime.
 CHAPTER SIX
 Marie awoke at dawn the next morning and jumped into her clothes.
 She was halfway down the stairs when she remembered she'd promised Rick that she'd wake him up so that he could stay within earshot of her.
 "Rick," she called, tapping on his door.
 "Rick."
 "Just a minute."
 Seconds later his door opened, and he blinked down at her sleepily.
 "You're already dressed?"

I was still the odd man out, but it was amusing watching Vincent preen.
 I never did figure out what it was he'd done, but apparently it had him thinking he was even more of a stud than normal.
 Whatever it was, it had Brandon pissed, which was a refreshing change.
 If he had to be friends with some of these people out of responsibility, that was one thing, but letting them continue to be jerks was taking it too far.
 Nobody was more surprised than me when Brandon pushed back from the table, scanned the room, and then pulled me to my feet.
 We spent the rest of lunch pacing around the outside of the school while he worked through whatever was bothering him.
 When the warning bell finally rang, he turned and looked at me with a considering smile.
 We stood like that for a good thirty seconds before he reached a single finger up and traced the left side of my face as he leaned in slightly.
 It was simultaneously the scariest and most exciting thing I'd ever experienced.
 Even as I leaned in a little bit myself, my thundering heart seemed to be trying to leap out of my throat solely for the purpose of disrupting what looked very much like it was going to be my first kiss.

So when he at last saw her moving through the fog, he ran to snatch her up.
 "Marie," he sighed into her hair.
 She could barely breathe but didn't want to be released.
 When he at last set her down, she continued to cling to him.
 "I wish you didn't have to go to work today."
 He was surprised by her words.
 "Do you want me to call in sick?"
 She drew back to look at him.
 "Would you do that?"
 "If you need me, sure."

Our families go really far back, it's almost like she's my sister sometimes.
 She doesn't like to listen to me, and when she gets mad, things get very unpleasant."
 It was a weak explanation, but there was something in his voice that made me believe him.
 The few doubts I still had melted away as I finally met his eyes.
 I've always been pretty good at reading people, and I'd never seen anyone whose eyes conveyed that level of sincerity.
 My voice caught, and it took a couple of tries to get actual words out.
 "She'll come after me."
 Brandon shook his head.
 "I won't let her.
 That's part of why I wanted to talk to you.

 I opened my mouth to answer, but words wouldn't make their way past the trembling in my chest.
 I felt tears start threatening to arrive and further humiliate me, but Rachel came to my rescue.
 "She's one of the tutors.
 Patty Sanders, who I happen to know has Mrs. Campbell's class sixth period, just gave her a note.
 Stay if you want, but she's done exactly what she was supposed to."
 I wanted to give Rachel a big hug, or maybe just break into tears right then and there.
 I managed to just give her a smile, and hold off on the tears until I'd gathered up my stuff and made it out of the room.

Mom isn't entirely healthy.
 Hasn't been since our father was killed.
 It isn't really her fault she behaves the way she does.
 When we humans get involved with shape shifters sometimes we pay a pretty serious price."
 It took me several seconds to understand why Rachel's words seemed so odd.
 Ever since learning Alec's secret I'd assumed everyone here was a shape shifter.
 Only I hadn't ever felt the underlying hint of power and energy from her that I'd come to associate with Alec and the others.
 "Wait, you're not a shape shifter?
 How is that possible?"
 Rachel's expression as she tried to understand my question was so surprised it actually managed to lighten the mood.

"What would you say if I told you you could go home tomorrow?"
 "I'd jump for joy.
 Why?"
 He squeezed the back of his chair, refusing to look at her.
 "Yesterday morning, after you went up to your room, I sat in the garden thinking about what your life in 1927 was like."
 His arms began to tremble.
 "I suddenly realized, when I looked out into the garden, that it was 1927."
 She gasped.
 "Are you sure?"
 "Yeah.

The time came sooner than any of us expected.
 Looking back, I suppose it was fortunate.
 I can‚Äôt imagine what might have happened if a full birth ceremony had been prepared, if so many had been present.
 It makes me cringe to merely think of it.
 The elders were there, though.
 My father and the others waited in the throne room, arranging a celebration.
 I had read everything I could obtain on the process during my pregnancy and imprisonment in the castle, even finding a few books and scrolls on humans.
 But nothing prepared me for what happened.
 I had been walking when the pain struck‚Äîpacing my room with worry, if I were truthful.
 It hit suddenly, a stabbing, ripping, horrible thing.

Harruq shook his head, feeling his anger growing.
 These men did not fight with their hearts.
 They fought with their heads, and such foolishness could not be tolerated.
 ‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll show you a real warrior,‚Äù he said.
 His muscles tensed, his legs bulged, and then he charged the two, oblivious to his own safety.
 Overwhelming any of their attacks, he was a moving mountain of muscle, dangerous and powerful.
 The meager defenses of the guards faltered.
 One tried to block as Condemnation came for his head.
 The blade broke through and cleaved his skull in two.
 The other brought his sword down too late.

Well, sort of locked up.
 I mean, I could have left.
 There were no bars or anything.
 But, I had no will, I had no good reason to do anything.
 Lorelei would just sit with me and we‚Äôd talk about small things, you know, what it was like outside, what she was reading, some painting she was doing.
 Almost anything but me getting back to the music.
 See, Lor, instinctively knew that was the sticking point, that me making music again was the key, but, also my deepest fear‚Äîthat I‚Äôd lost it all.
 That I‚Äôd never write another meaningful song.
 I‚Äôd rather not say which hospital this was.
 Just because of, you know, the privacy thing.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right; we are not going to the Northern Kingdoms.
 A few companions and I were hiding out in the Aridas and in one of the higher hollows I found an old farmhouse.
 It has been abandoned for a long time, but it is well made and there is water and lots of fruit trees and berry bushes that must be left over from an old orchard.‚Äù After a moment he added, ‚ÄúI always thought that if I ever needed a place to hide out that it was ideal.
 Of course it will be rough there.
 Outside of what we bring, there will not be much.
 But it will be a good place to rest and‚Ä¶‚Äù he said gently patting his stomach, ‚Äúheal up.
 We should be there by nightfall.‚Äù ‚ÄúNot bad,‚Äù said Imeralda.
 ‚ÄúSounds like a place that will be hard to find, but is this not territory infested with wild Dire beast?‚Äù ‚ÄúYup,‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚Äúanother reason I think this area is usually hard to find; most people stay clear.‚Äù He continued after a pause to let them think of entering territory known to be the hunting range of feared predators, ‚ÄúI never saw any sign of any Dire beast in the hollows when I was there, but, of course, they probably know of the place.
 Still, I would rather handle a pack of Hellhounds than The Immortal Guards.‚Äù Neither looked pleased at his logic, but both nodded.
 A few hours later it was starting to get dark as Rodregas recognized the spot and turned the wagon left for the final hard assent.

‚ÄúWe have anything to eat?‚Äù
 His brother motioned to a small plate of bacon and some eggs still in their shells.
 ‚ÄúWonderful.‚Äù
 The smaller half-orc watched his brother wolf down the meal.
 ‚ÄúWould you accompany me into madness?‚Äù he asked.
 Harruq gave him a funny look, half a piece of bacon still hanging in his mouth.
 ‚ÄúOf course I would,‚Äù he replied.
 ‚ÄúIf you go mad, I‚Äôve got no chance in this world.
 You brains, me brawn, right?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Qurrah said absently.

It would not be surprising if a patrol of the Immortal Guard would be on the road.
 The road was the main route from the port city of Chrisana Stone to the Menagerie of Sky, Earth and Water; the slave city run by the Immortalist Taiga.
 Most likely what Imeralda sensed was simply a trade caravan running a regular route from Chrisana Stone to any of several of the Eastern Realms cities.
 If it was a light scouting patrol of just two or three guards that was coming; it would be the best case scenario for them to take on some Immortalist Guards and gain better weapons, armor and horses.
 Of course, if it was a slave caravan then they would simply sit and watch, as it would be suicide to do anything against a full patrol.
 Rodregas heard a rustle in the brush and glanced over to make sure it was just a squirrel or the like.
 He started to jump up as a humanoid shape appeared out of the trees, until he saw that it was just Imeralda.
 She seemed to be paying less attention now to stealth as she was to speed.
 From Imeralda‚Äôs expression Rodregas knew it was something more dangerous than a trade caravan coming down the road.
 Imeralda squatted down next to them and whispered, ‚ÄúA slave caravan is coming; it‚Äôs small but they have a score of guards.

‚ÄúBut whatever it was, it saved your life.‚Äù ‚ÄúUh I have a feeling I should thank it, but I don‚Äôt know how you thank light.‚Äù I muttered.
 ‚ÄúYou thank it like you would thank anyone else,‚Äù A voice said.
 I almost jumped to the moon in surprise.
 Out of nowhere someone, or something, appeared beside Jason.
 I think Jason was more scared because he actually jumped into the air.
 As it came into view, it became obvious that it was a girl.
 She in a yellow cloak and had dazzling red hair.
 She smiled warmly at us with her chocolate brown eyes and I realized she had pointed ears.
 So I basically made the conclusion that she wasn‚Äôt human.
 ‚ÄúUh okay‚Ä¶‚Äù I said slowly.

He set it beside him and let it grow out to normal size.
 From within he pulled out a suit of armor stained a deep shade of black.
 He threw it to Harruq, who managed to catch it even though his mouth hung wide open.
 ‚ÄúThe first Horde War was caused by a disciple of mine,‚Äù the man in black explained.
 ‚ÄúHe blessed the armor of one of the leaders of the orcish clans.
 I claimed it when he fell on the battlefield.‚Äù
 Harruq examined the suit, turning it over in his hands.
 It was composed of many interwoven straps of thick leather.
 Obsidian buckles and clamps held the pieces together.
 The only color was a yellow scorpion emblazoned on the chest.

Studies have found that a 10 per cent increase in expenditure on training can boost productivity by an average of 3 per cent over two years and by as much as 30 times the cost of training.
 Yet even today, only a relatively small number of companies conduct regular, ongoing training programmes.
 Launch a nationwide public educational programme on the tremendous potential gains in productivity from increased training.
 Support initiatives by providing incentives to intensify training programmes for all employees by every type of commercial and non-commercial institution in order systemati cally to upgrade the technical, vocational, organizational and managerial skills of the workforce.
 10.School-to-work apprenticeship programmes: The transition from school or college to work can be long and difficult.
 Germany's apprenticeship programme equips nearly 70 per cent of all teenagers with employable skills before they enter the workforce.
 Two-thirds of the UK workforce have no vocational or professional qualification, compared with only 25 per cent in Germany.
 There is growing support in the United States for establishment of a national youth apprenticeship training programme that combines classroom schooling with on-the-job skills training to ensure a smooth transition to employment for those who do not pursue higher education.
 11.Link demilitarization to urban employment: The military possesses both the expertise and the physical infrastructure for training large numbers of people in a wide range of technical, vocational and social skills.
 Building upon success ful US Defence Department programmes that re-deploy soldiers to assist troubled inner city youth, closed military bases can be converted into large training centres operated by military teaching staff for instructing and housing urban unemployed youth during an apprenticeship period.

He was an adult and could leave the rehab center anytime he wanted, but the staff was well trained in convincing him otherwise.
 Everyone I talked to at Narconon had been through the program themselves and were former addicts.
 The young man assigned to our son was wonderful.
 He explained that he had been through over a dozen programs before this program resolved his cravings and addressed his issues.
 He had been clean for six years, and I could only pray for the same result.
 He had worked there since he graduated the program and he assured me they would do their best to help Brandon.
 The facility where Brandon was staying was nearly a nine-hour drive from our home.
 We talked to Brandon on the phone occasionally and every time we did it was as if a cloud was slowly lifting and he was starting to think more clearly.
 He seemed to be growing up.
 He had never really matured like his younger brother because in his world of drugs he was not living reality.

They reached the western gate, which remained open during the day.
 Without ceremony, they were kicked through, both falling to the dirt and scraping their knees.
 ‚ÄúGet going,‚Äù one said.
 ‚ÄúSee if somewhere else will take your mutt ass.‚Äù
 It was not just adrenaline that caused Harruq‚Äôs hands to shake, but Qurrah put his hand on his wrist and begged him to calm.
 ‚ÄúNever forget this shame,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúLet it burn in you.
 Let it be a reminder of what I have always said.
 We are better, superior.
 Never feel guilt at what we do to them, for you see what they would do to us.‚Äù

They circled back, returning to the Erze forest nestled around Woodhaven.
 Dieredon had returned too late to find and assault Velixar, so instead he had kept his troops hidden and waiting.
 The battle ended as he had hoped, and even Antonil had survived, Celestia be praised.
 The elf glanced back, memorizing the exact direction the undead marched.
 ‚ÄúClever, and disgusting,‚Äù he added.
 ‚ÄúDeath is nothing but a recruitment tool for you.‚Äù
 Half an hour later, he and a hundred other elves riding atop pegasi followed the necromancer north.
 As they flew, they passed over a small campfire dotting the empty field below.
 Their passage above went unheard and unseen, for the two lone souls sitting on opposite sides of that campfire were deep in conversation.

I half thought he was going to ride up front in the crowded cab, but he instead cleared the sides of the truck in a jump that was almost inhumanly graceful.
 He crowded in, close enough I could feel my skin start to tingle with anticipation, and then Vincent started the engine and we were off.
 In what was probably the only display of maturity and common sense I'd ever seen out of Vincent, he didn't tear off down the freeway at eighty miles per hour.
 He was still going plenty fast, but at least the wind wasn't deafening.
 After a few minutes of white-knuckled fear, I was finally able to relax a little, and enjoy the feeling of having Brandon so close while the wind tossed my hair back and forth.
 The other girls were studiously ignoring me while they gossiped back and forth about everyone from underclassmen to teachers and other adults in the town.
 I didn't want to join in the gossip, and Brandon was sprawled out on the pickup bed with his eyes closed.
 I settled for contemplating the glorious sunset's myriad colors.
 We passed some kind of border into one of the parks.
 Vincent slowed down a little more as I was busy taking in the incredible pinks and purples that were dominating the western sky.

My paycheck wasn't going to cut it.
 I was still trying to decide whether or not to head back into the cafeteria, when the first bell rang, signaling a fitting end to a disappointment-filled lunch.
 History wasn't any better, and we had a sub for Physics.
 Alec actually walked into class, saw Mrs. Alexander wasn't there, and then turned around and left.
 It was possibly the most brazen act of class cutting I'd ever seen, and somehow it didn't surprise me in the least.
 Even so, I spent the rest of the hour stewing while working on the pointless, busywork assignment the sub handed out.
 Mrs. Tiggs still hadn't finished grading our tests, which meant I still had no idea how I'd done.
 By the time I finally half-collapsed at my normal table in the tutor lab, all I could think about was how nice it would be to see Brandon one more time as he drove me home.
 I looked around to verify that all of the usual suspects were there.
 Geeks, check.

‚ÄúThe syphon said he would be rewarded for grabbing me.
 I think he wasn't trying to kill me but trying to knock me out.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo he could bring you to Kojas.‚Äù He nodded but he seemed somewhere else.
 He sighed and said, ‚ÄúI hope they won't go too far to achieve that, or it'll get harder to hide this from Emily and Jason.‚Äù I crossed my arms.
 ‚ÄúI told you that we should tell them.

She was smiling, glorious now, her arms outstretched.
 The pendant started to glow and the darkness cracked.
 The wind was howling.

 Blind, mute and still.
 And yet I knew everyone was dying.
 Running and screaming and dying.

Ruby didn‚Äôt look like she could think of anything funny about what she‚Äôd said, but she continued.
 ‚ÄúSecondly, don‚Äôt cut yourself.

 There were intricate designs carved on the handle and runes etched in the blade.
 It wasn‚Äôt as heavy as it appeared.
 I moved it around a bit, slashing wide arcs though the chill air.
 It was pleasant, nicely balanced in my hand.
 That didn‚Äôt mean I could actually cut through someone‚Äôs neck, though.
 ‚ÄúRuby, how do you intend to teach me with this?
 I mean if there‚Äôs no messing around, just lop your head off and all?‚Äù She laughed.

Rodregas nodded, he agreed but he was not the young man he looked.
 ‚ÄúI do understand that, and I expect nothing from her.‚Äù  He smiled and said, ‚ÄúBut I do plan to enjoy what we do have for as long as it lasts.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd when she takes other lovers?‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan asked.
 Rodregas responded with the only answer he had, ‚ÄúI will do my best to handle it and not get jealous,‚Äù he said.
 Rodregas knew it would be hard, but he was a hard man and he would have to manage.
 Doi‚Äôvan nodded, then glanced over to see Imeralda walking over with several of the Grimoires and he added, ‚ÄúI was not angry, in fact, by my people‚Äôs standards I was being very easy on you since you are human and can‚Äôt handle pain like an Orqui.
 Without pain, you will not reach your potential for quickness and reflexes.
 On the practice field such quickness means fewer bruises.
 On the battle field such reflexes means life and death.‚Äù Rodregas nodded, his words held the ring of truth, but he was not looking forward to days of practices and days full of bruises.

All I saw was blackness, the blackness of dried blood.
 I don‚Äôt know what Crafty and Skippy thought‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt even leave them a note.
 I feel bad about it now‚Äîand this, finally, I think, was what pissed Crafty off and led him to hire a lawyer for himself, to try and, you know, basically, steal my material.
 It was like, if you‚Äôre not gonna represent yourself well, we‚Äôre gonna take away your soul, all your work, all your history.
 Shit.
 That shark he hired---what a bastard.
 But, I was oblivious at the time.
 God bless Pete.
 He handled it all.

Industrial estates, export processing zones, export promotion councils, export insurance, warehouse receipts, quality standards, and thousands of other organizational innovations have been either created or borrowed by developing countries to accelerate social progress.
 A comprehensive study of successful systems and institutions that can be transferred and adapted to local conditions will document the enormous untapped potential for stimulating faster economic and job growth by inventing, imitating and further improving social systems.
 Action Plan to Stimulate Employment in Developing Countries
 Employment generation is a product of multiple factors that combine together.
 Stimulating job creation requires a comprehensive approach, rather than partial policies or piecemeal strategies.
 The achievements of the Newly Industrializing Economies (NIEs) of East Asia demonstrate that tremendous increases in employment generation can be achieved based on comprehensive strategies.
 While broad prescriptions should not be indiscriminately applied to the widely disparate situations confronting different countries, the availability of a number of tested methods under lines the fact that effective and proven policy measures can be formulated to meet the employment needs of every developing country.
 A number of the strategies briefly listed below are enlarged upon in sub sequent chapters of the report, but listed here for the purpose of comprehensiveness
 1.Emphasize agriculture: Utilize agriculture as a source of economic growth and job creation by a shift to high value-added, commercial crops, supported by policy measures to upgrade technology, improve skills, raise productivity, ensure the supply of essential inputs, establish marketing and distribution chan nels, create linkages between agriculture and industry, and cater to export markets.
 2.Promote small enterprises: Promote small enterprises by policies to make technology, training, credit, marketing and distribution channels more easily accessible to small business, and by forging linkages between universities, research institutes and small enter prises.

Each time we got together, we talked about books and ideas.
 Here is the conclusion of her favorite poem, "The Night They Burned Shanghai":
 Tonight Shanghai is burning, And we are dying too.
 What bomb more surely mortal Than death inside of you?
 For some men die by shrapnel, And some go down in flames, But most men perish inch by inch, In play at little games.
 Sylvia helped me remember to vow I wouldn‚Äôt go down that way.
 A while ago, a woman I enjoyed hanging out with accused me of being "serious."
 I don't think it was a compliment.
 I like to laugh, hear jokes and funny songs, whack golf balls back and forth across a fairway, cheer for teams and bring pleasant news wherever I can.
 But I don't understand how we can fail to get serious when people are burning, starving, weeping and hopelessly perishing, and while deep down we know we're not all we could be, or doing all we could do.

Rodregas thought he was alone until he heard Imeralda speak from behind him, ‚ÄúDid you see who is watching from the Great Hall‚Äôs door?‚Äù she asked.
 Rodregas glanced over, it was Van‚Äôdret.
 He stood tall and handsome, young squires surrounding him ready to serve.
 Rodregas thought that the Immortalist was watching him.
 He would have to leave quickly after the tournament, as the man was growing suspicious of them.
 Rodregas would have loved to kill him, but Van‚Äôdret was a powerful sorcerer capable of magic that made him nearly impossible to kill.
 ‚ÄúDo you remember The Lion?‚Äù asked Imeralda.
 ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 He sounded as confused as he felt.
 ‚ÄúThe Celestial Lion.

Yes, we both feel the call of the moon.
 Does that scare you?"
 I shook my head.
 "No.

 You wouldn't hurt me after everything you've done for us."
 "I could kill you without even meaning to.
 You're so fragile.
 All it would take is an accident, a momentary loss of control.

They held no torches or lanterns.
 The wind shifted, and upon its gentle flow the stench of death came to them.
 The villagers slowed, fearfully eyeing the line.
 The stars were bright, and there was no mistaking that something was amiss.
 They were no soldiers.
 Only a scattered few wore armor.
 Still, they stood in the straight lines of a disciplined army.
 A roar from Harruq at their heels spurred them on.
 They charged the line, crying out for aid.
 ‚ÄúA creature attacked our town,‚Äù shouted the mother.

‚ÄúTrue, but I will not stint in thanking the gods for a favorable ceremony.
 Keep a few guards at the gate, but only the minimum needed.
 But that does remind me.
 Release any remaining prisoners and make sure they are fed and clothed, and allow them to make their way back to their homes.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat has some danger to it,‚Äù said Captain Poir hurriedly, his expression returning to a look of concern.
 ‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù he replied.
 ‚ÄúBut do as I command,‚Äù Rodregas stated in his firmest voice.
 Captain Poir nodded and immediately said, ‚ÄúAs you command, master.‚Äù Rodregas started to open the door to the stairway when another thought hit him, and he turned back to the captain, and said, ‚ÄúI need time to adjust.
 Make sure that I am not disturbed in my quarters tonight, but tell Adapt Korin that before he leaves to celebrate, to come up to my room for some last minute instructions.‚Äù Captain Poir responded with his very military, ‚ÄúYes sir.‚Äù  Rodregas had to admit while most of the guards were no better trained than a ruffian off the street the captain had served with The Immortal Guards and he was highly trained and disciplined.
 Rodregas had always wondered what had brought a man of his obvious military background to serve Ravenhurr; thank goodness he clearly did not understand the simplest things about magic.
 On the other hand, the AElf maiden clearly had some ideas.

What started as a project he was very enthusiastic about became an afterthought to time with friends and partying.

We sat there in silence and I leaned on his shoulder.
 We both stopped shivering as we stared at the sky.

 There was a long silence.
 ‚ÄúThis is too awkward and I don‚Äôt like the silence.

The tremendous economic achievements of Japan during the post-war period, followed during the last two decades by other East Asian economic powers and most recently by China, suggest that the time required for transition can be substantially abridged and the fruits of development achieved much sooner than has been accomplished by nations in the past.
 The rising expectations of people around the globe and the potential risks of failing to heed their call have added a greater sense of urgency to the quest for this knowledge.
 Eastern Europe
 The challenges posed by extremely rapid transition are nowhere more graphically depicted than in the current transition of the countries of Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Cold War and the break-up of the USSR.
 Although this transition is often described in political and economic terms, it is far broader and deeper in its implications.
 These nations are in the midst of a simultaneous multi-dimensional transformation ‚Äì politically, from authoritarian to democratic forms of government; economically, from a centrally planned command system to free market economies; industrially, from defence-oriented to consumer-oriented production; administratively, from highly centralized to decentralized systems; structurally, from state ownership of property to multiple forms of ownership in all spheres; socially, from closed and isolated to open and internationally integrated societies; culturally, from almost exclusive emphasis on values of equity and collective security to strong emphasis on the values of freedom and individual responsibility.
 The transformation of Eastern Europe and the former USSR is of vital concern to all of us.
 Never before in human history has such massive change been carried out as an essentially peaceful revolution.
 The end of apartheid in South Africa and recent progress in the Middle East show that this process continues to have beneficial repercussions around the world.
 At the same time, this incredible advance has been accompanied by events that have destabilized the political and economic systems of the entire region, led to the break-up of the USSR, war in Bosnia, the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the COMECON trade system, a massive brain drain and the threat of huge waves of economic refugees.

Rodregas looked down at her with her head on his shoulder and her pile of auburn curls spread equally over both their naked bodies.
 Her long hair covered a lot of the two of them but really hid nothing.
 He met her large green eyes and said, ‚ÄúYou amaze me.
 I knew you were brave and courageous, but now I know where your true magic talent is...‚Äù He looked at her eyes as he spoke and even when he smiled at his own words, he let her see the sincerity of what he said.
 The main rule of flattery with women is to never lie.
 It was a lesson taught to Rodregas by a lost love, and one that had served him well over the years.
 Most women can always tell a lie, especially in such a moment of connection as the talk after good sex.
 Luckily, even with far more normal women there is always something good you can say; with Imeralda he could have gone on for hours.
 Imeralda‚Äôs eyes lit up in pleasure and humor at his words but, of course, he was careful to say nothing of the future, nothing of love.
 Such talk would serve no purpose and would likely ruin the moment.

I tried to listen, but exhaustion won out and their words began to meld into dreams.
 I could hear them as I was drifting, floating in a great shadowed lake.
 My white gown spread around me in the water, now-dark hair swaying with the ripples on the surface.
 I rose above, peering down at myself, and the image turned into my mother, the dark water going black, the ripples transforming to wind.
 I recognized the scene as her pendant began to glow, the wind howling, screams piercing my ears.
 It was the same dream, but different now.
 I glanced around to find a village I didn‚Äôt know.
 Someone was coming toward me, an expression of fear and sadness on his handsome face.
 His familiar face.
 He reached out to me and I stepped toward him, tears streaming down my cheeks.

I suddenly had a hard time breathing.
 The idea of lying alone in the dark, in the very room I'd just seen Brandon demolish, sent my heart into an erratic rhythm.
 If there'd been an EMT present they'd have already been charging up the defibrillator.
 Alec turned around while I was still trying to get my throat to work again.
 "You stopped breathing.
 What's wrong?"
 The tears his touch had dried up a few seconds before were back, and just seconds away from escaping the corners of my eyes by the time I finally pulled myself up onto my knees and managed to speak.
 "Please don't send me there.
 Not after my dream."
 There was just enough moonlight trickling into the room for me to see his expression change.

Arrows quickly followed these maneuvers, biting into exposed flesh.
 Qurrah motioned to the building housing the archers.

 Harruq kicked open the barricaded door and then barged up the stairs.
 Qurrah withdrew a few pieces of bone from a pouch.
 He tightened his grip about them, whispering a few words of magic as he did.
 Then he looked to the window.

Or hand over Perelandra College to someone.
 Spend more time growing vegetables and cooking from scratch, like Brother Lawrence did.
 Toni Torrey could give me gardening and cooking lessons.
 For lessons in devoting myself to communion with God, besides contemplating Brother Lawrence, I can turn to Olga.
 Peace
 Olga Savitsky was a poet.
 We met at a small church charismatic enough so that nobody minded when she stood in the midst of a service and offered her latest poem.
 Long ago, Olga had discovered that what she needed most was God.
 She would hike and pray her way up Cowles Mountain, a mile and a half of rocky trail, then call her best friend Warren so they could pray together, sometimes for hours.
 Then she might go to work, cleaning somebody‚Äôs home while listening to worship music.

Her lock finally clicked and she stood up.
 The boys were walking side by side towards the play set.
 It wasn‚Äôt actually that small but it looked that way from the street.

He was the Master and it would not be surprising for Ravenhurr to keep him waiting for a few minutes.
 Korin waited patiently, seemingly at ease with what Rodregas would assume to be strange behavior by Master Ravenhurr.
 ‚ÄúAre you ready to leave and celebrate my new birth?‚Äù  Rodregas asked him.
 Adept Korin nodded politely and said, ‚ÄúYes, Master, the gods favor your desire to imitate their celestial glory.‚Äù Rodregas nodded back in acknowledgement and said, ‚ÄúAnd have you found any new bodies who you would like to‚Ä¶ take?‚Äù That question seemed to surprise him, but Korin smiled and said, ‚ÄúNo, Master.
 I have been too busy working on my studies.‚Äù Korin now looked at him with a surprised expression and an eyebrow slightly raised.
 Rodregas wondered if he had said something wrong.
 While he had seen the two interact for some years, he really did not know what was appropriate for him to say in such a circumstance.
 Rodregas knew that he did not have the skills for pretending he was a powerful Immortalist sorcerer, so he said, ‚ÄúHow many people have you killed during the past year Korin?
 And how many others have you raped or tortured?‚Äù he asked, trying to keep a calm voice.
 Now Korin looked very surprised and he started looking around.

She was an elemental fairy and, like me, sported a fine head of red hair.‚Äù She ran a hand under the curls for emphasis.
 ‚ÄúShe heard a story one day of a mixed-species birth and got it in her head she could breed a more powerful magic.
 Apparently she thought she could control her offspring and use the magic to her advantage‚Ä¶ I suppose she thought she could rule the world.‚Äù Ruby smirked.
 ‚ÄúShe studied various species for a few moons and decided her best chance at conquest was a dark elf.
 She made her way to this very village and happened across my father, poor unsuspecting sap.‚Äù Ruby flitted her fingers, glasses and wine served before each of us as she continued.
 ‚ÄúSo there he was and she, just a wisp of a woman, flew up to him and blew a little fairy dust‚Ä¶ well, you know about that.‚Äù I narrowed my eyes at her.
 Ruby grinned.
 ‚ÄúHe was putty in her hands.
 It was all over before he even knew her purpose.
 She kept him under her enchantments and lies as long as she could.

Czechoslovakia had not suffered from inflation and was largely free of external debt.
 Hungary, which had decentralized its economy and had introduced significant elements of the market in production and investment before 1989, was not subject to the sudden shocks due to import liberalization and termination of planning.
 Lessons from the Reform
 The failure of the transition strategy to produce the anticipated results has given rise to extreme hardship, growing anxiety, frustration and anger within these countries.
 Internationally, it has generated intense debate about the reasons for the failure, the efficacy of ‚Äòshock therapy‚Äô, and the appropriateness and adequacy of Western assistance.
 These questions reflect an inadequate understanding, both within and outside the region, of the stages and process and essential conditions for an effective transition under the circumstances prevalent in Eastern Europe at the time.
 Understanding of this failure holds the key not only to the rapid revitalization of the former Soviet and other Eastern European republics, but also to meeting the challenges of present and future transitions in Africa, Asia and the West.
 This understanding can be summarized in the form of several lessons that can be derived from the general experience of countries in the region.
 1.Multi-dimensional transitions cannot be brought about by uni-dimensional strategies: The economic dimension of transition cannot be viewed and acted upon in isolation from its political and social dimensions.
 The reform programme was developed and guided by domestic and foreign economists who viewed the transition much like a change of clothing ‚Äì the casting off of one set of economic principles and the adoption of another ‚Äì ignoring the critical importance of social and political factors.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what just happened,‚Äù she said, the quiver in her voice belying her calm speech.
 ‚ÄúBut I know I don‚Äôt like it and will not accept it.
 Ever.
 Is that clear?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Harruq said.
 ‚ÄúNow will you let me down?‚Äù
 For a moment, she said nothing, catching her breath and doing her best to calm the flood of adrenaline that still rushed through her.
 Harruq twisted against the vines, but they still held firm.
 Blood continued to trickle down his chin.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not blind,‚Äù she said, suddenly looking away.

I appraised myself in the mirror and smiled, and then shook my head, certain the dust was still influencing me.
 When I walked into the main room, Chevelle was sitting on the bench seat, leaning over as he worked on something.
 He raised his head as I approached, closing his hand around whatever it was before sliding it into a pocket.
 He seemed mildly anxious.
 I was still feeling peculiar so I climbed into the seat beside him, curling my feet up close.
 He watched me, his eyes lingering even after I had settled.
 It felt as if he yearned to say something.
 The tension became too much and I broke.
 ‚ÄúRuby drugged me.‚Äù He smiled.
 ‚ÄúShe told me.

The first store we stopped at didn't take us seriously until Rachel pulled out a black American Express, after which every sales person in the entire place lined up to assist us.
 Once we each sported a bag or two from some ridiculously over-priced store, things went much more smoothly.
 I tried on a variety of jeans, blouses, shirts, skirts, dresses, and just about every other article of clothing imaginable.
 I drew the line at a swimsuit, since there was no way on earth I'd ever wear one, and then felt so bad at how crushed Rachel was that I let her drag me into a store full of formals.
 It was a mistake because I soon found myself being zipped into a delicate, green dress that I was absolutely positive wasn't going to survive the experience of trying to wrap itself around me.
 "Oh, it's perfect, Adri.
 We have to get it."
 I avoided looking at the mirror.
 It seemed like a crime to defile such a pretty dress, and I wanted to remember it like it had looked on the hanger, all shimmery and wispy.
 I did risk a look down at the price tag.

Then, as attention turned to more mundane problems closer to home, the sense of relief and celebration was replaced by growing concern over the increasing prominence of other threats to international security: some of these were aggravated by the new positive developments, while others had not previously seemed so serious by comparison with the threat of nuclear annihilation.
 The end of political confrontation between East and West, the sudden conversion of authoritarian communist states into demo cratic market economies, and substantial cuts in global defence spending were accompanied by increasing political instability and ethnic violence in the many parts of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, by the horren dous loss of life due to civil and ethnic strife in several African countries, by growing concern over drugs and violent crime in the West, by the danger of nuclear terrorism resulting from potential theft of Soviet weapons, and by pressure on defence producers to compensate for reduced domestic defence budgets by increasing arms exports.
 This surprising turn of events has led some to re-examine the incredible achievements of the period and conclude that they were either vastly overstated or, perhaps, even illusory.
 Others have come to take these achievements for granted.
 Still others have simply forgotten how much things have really changed.
 But the most important realization to be derived from these events is of the inherent defect in attempts to address the factors underlying international security in a piece meal manner.
 Over the past five years the Commission encountered reminders of this truth in virtually every field that it took up for examination.
 It is this experience that has convinced us of the need for wider perspectives and total solutions.
 The marvellous achievements of the past few years are neither fortuitous nor illusory.
 The Berlin Wall has been brought down and demolished.

She rubbed her breasts on my back and buttocks as she maneuvered her body over mine.
 I couldn‚Äôt help but be aroused.
 She leaned in close to my ear with her mouth, her young body firmly against my back, and then asked me seductively if I would sell her the Oxy.
 I told her I would find out how many I had and we could probably work something out and sell them to her.
 She then asked me to turn over and she sat on me, barely above my crotch.
 I immediately noticed a tattooed first name of ‚ÄúSteve‚Äù on her flat stomach, just right of her belly button.
 I tapped the tattoo and ask her if that was her boyfriend‚Äôs name.
 She leaned into me and whispered that it is just some guy who treats her like crap but she keeps going back to him.
 The fact that she chose to whisper that bit of information convinced me he was outside the open door.
 As we talked I described to her that I had a very controlling wife and two young children at home.

"Actually, that's why I wanted to talk to you this morning.
 I've been shooting that new place I left you the note about.
 The one that bunch of kids your age told me about.
 Anyways, it's the best place I've found so far.
 I've been shooting it at pretty much all hours, but I think I need to get higher up for the shot I want."
 I knew exactly where this was going.
 Actually, I was kind of relieved she wasn't going to be around this afternoon.
 Birthdays are supposed to be special.
 Dad had always understood that and done an amazing job of surprising us with something new and unusual on our birthdays.
 Mom had always felt like a round of happy birthdays and a cake more than met the requirements for birthday specialness.

Marie sighed with pleasure as she returned Rick‚Äôs kiss.
 She‚Äôd never dreamed anything could make her feel this way.
 ‚ÄúAre you hungry?‚Äù he asked, kissing the tip of her nose.
 ‚ÄúStarved.‚Äù  She hugged him.
 They went downstairs with their arms around each other.
 ‚ÄúDid you make pancakes?‚Äù she asked.
 ‚ÄúYeah.
 I‚Äôm starved, and I figured you would be too.
 So we‚Äôre having pancakes and bacon and eggs and juice.‚Äù ‚ÄúMmm‚Äîthat sounds great.
 And it smells even better.‚Äù  She sat down, poured syrup on her pancakes, and dug in.

Jasmin had told him I'd overheard her death threats, and he'd decided to use his good looks to convince me to keep quiet.
 Only he hadn't been able to keep the act up for more than just a few seconds.
 I must really repulse him.
 Physics was my own little personal hell for the next forty minutes.
 I absorbed absolutely nothing from the rest of the discussion about calculating mechanical advantage, and when we were finally released into our groups Alec and I didn't even look each other in the eyes.
 I gutted out the last five minutes by pretending I was completely absorbed in a reference book while Alec started running preliminary calculations.
 He was out of his seat and halfway to the door by the time I'd even realized the bell had rung to dismiss us.
 Spanish was both better and worse.
 Better because without Alec sitting six feet away from me I was able to think about something other than him, worse because we had a pop quiz and I barely placed in the A- range despite having spent a fair amount of time on my vocabulary.
 Math was plain and simply burning up too much time.

Jim ‚Äì Well, he kept on badgering me and asking me how he could make it truly evil, you know Gene, once he gets something into his head he sticks with it until he gets it working, unless it almost kills him.
 Liz ‚Äì Or until he gets beaten up.
 Jim ‚Äì That too.
 Liz ‚Äì So what did you suggest?
 Jim ‚Äì I told him that calling people at 3 am wasn‚Äôt evil.
 Calling people at 3 am long distance and collect is evil.
 I figured that way he would at least stop calling me.
 Liz ‚Äì Oh, that‚Äôs all.
 Wait a minute‚Ä¶ How did he get the queen of England‚Äôs home phone number?
 And how did he get them to accept a long distance collect call from someone they didn‚Äôt even know?

I wasn't particularly hungry, but I couldn't lose much more weight without Mom dragging me into a doctor.
 Besides, it gave me an excuse to try and ignore the fact that half of the people in the room seemed to be staring at me when they thought I wasn't looking.
 I finally worked up enough courage to look across the cafeteria as I peeled the label off of the can.
 Alec wasn't at his usual place, but Brandon was at his normal table, surrounded by a smaller than normal group.
 The discussion looked way more intense than normal, and seemed to center around him and Cassie.
 It was all so crazy.
 Two weeks ago my life had revolved around my inability to think of certain things without collapsing.
 That hadn't changed, but now there was a distinct possibility Jasmin was going to hurt me just to ensure I stayed silent.
 Oh, and I was actually considering opening myself up for some very nasty ridicule, just on the infinitesimally slim chance a boy who was so popular, rich, and gorgeous that he shouldn't even know my name might be interested in me.
 Life was supposed to get better as you got older, but it was starting to look like it just got more complicated.

‚ÄúWhere did we finish?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúActually we did pretty good.
 There were more than a few that cannot go on, even if you had won.
 You finished eighth overall in the tournament, with a second place white ribbon for the joust.
 Several of those who would now be higher are too injured to continue.
 So you are now in fourth place overall.
 Geriodon and Nordien were the top two finishers,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan.
 Rodregas nodded.
 The pain was easier to manage knowing that at least he was still in the running for the tournament championship.
 Imeralda stepped into his sight shaking her head, ‚ÄúYou men are crazy sometimes; you actually look pleased!

I tucked the pouch under the long bell sleeve of the dress as they crossed the room to seize me by the arms.
 Chapter Five Trials
 I stood in the center of a council chamber I had never before seen.
 Vast libraries lined the walls, interspersed with decorated frames and ornate mirrors.
 A great vaulted ceiling rose overhead, embellished with intricate carvings, painted in every detail.
 Across the empty space before me was an elaborate table that seated six leaders of High Council.
 The guards who had brought me here were standing behind me, within arm‚Äôs reach on either side.
 Left of them were council members and, as I glanced right, Chevelle walked in to stand at attention, facing the council table.
 I could hear others enter behind us, presumably witnesses, and I wondered if Junnie was among them.
 ‚ÄúElfreda Georgiana Suzetta Glaforia stands before High Council‚Ä¶‚Äù The formal tone of the speaker severed my rambling thoughts, dragging me back to a frightening reality.

After me.
 I didn‚Äôt hesitate, just pulled my arm up and swung hard, backhand.
 The blade cut clean and his head rolled backward, hitting the ground with a sickening thud.
 I looked away.
 The others stared at me.
 I couldn‚Äôt blame them.
 Steed‚Äôs voice was low, wary.
 ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt mean you, Frey.‚Äù I turned, unable to stand the bloody vision in my peripheral.
 The tracker‚Äôs words waited in Chevelle‚Äôs hand.
 ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said, feeling slightly detached from myself.

He took her face in his hands, making her look into his eyes.
 "Everything'll be fine, sweetheart.

 He brushed his lips over hers.
 Marie didn't relax until everyone had tasted the lasagna that evening.
 It was good, and she smiled when Rick winked at her over his second forkful.
 "Do you cook a lot?"
 Teri asked Marie.
 "Not a lot.

You need to worry about getting better, and nothing else."
 My pout met with just as much success as it usually did.
 After a second or two I gave up and nodded.
 "Okay, I promise to be good and concentrate on getting better, if you'll come keep me company."
 The flash of emotion, barely visible in Alec's eyes, was a source of hope and despair all at once.
 Eagerness, desire.
 Both curbed by the same iron will that'd continued fighting long past where most people would've given up and died.
 I patted the bed next to me, wincing slightly as even that simple motion pulled on things that weren't meant to be pulled on.
 He stared at me for several seconds, and then sat down on the bed.
 I waited, and then when I was sure that was as close as he planned on getting, I slid closer, resting my head on his arm.

She'd gotten here by strolling through it thinking about Davis.
 She'd been thinking about the kiss that had hurt and horrified her.
 Would he be sorry he'd done that now that she was gone?
 Surely he'd realized he'd hurt her.
 She'd tried to push him away, and her lips had been bleeding.
 Marie frowned.
 He always apologized for shouting at her, but that hadn't stopped him from shouting at her again.
 He'd apologized for hurting her arm, but that hadn't stopped him from hurting her with his kiss.
 Would her life with him be like that?
 A series of angry words or painful grasps or bruising kisses followed by apologies?

 had been some sort of strange magic, some sort of accident.
 She was lucky everything was back to normal.
 "I believe your taste has changed, darling," Mrs. Tranton said as she watched Marie examine her latest selection in the mirror.
 "Really?

 She no longer cared for the stylish clothes that had appealed to her before.
 What she had on now was a simple black dress very much like the one Rick had bought her.

No longer can non-combatants sit quietly on the sidelines or work productively undisturbed.
 War both between and within states has come to involve and affect all of society.
 Infrastructure and production facilities have become a principal target of military action.
 Food supplies are frequently the first major casualty and most lethal weapon.
 A single explosion can paralyze a major metropolis or contaminate an entire region with toxic material, dwarfing the devastation caused by the industrial accidents at Chernobyl and Bhopal.
 The disruption of trade resulting even from regional conflicts such as the Gulf War or the war in Bosnia, impacts not only on the economies of the belligerents, but also on neighbours, trading partners and global economic performance.
 Neither the victor nor the victim can any longer afford to resolve conflicts violently.
 Political states may still be able to survive wars, but developmental achievements can not.
 So long as the benefits of development are confined to one or a few sections of society, the costs of militarization and war may not prevent economic and social progress.
 But when the need is to fulfil the rising expectations of the masses by extending the benefits of development to the entire society ‚Äì thus enabling the society as a whole to move to the next higher level of collective affluence and fulfilment ‚Äì every social resource must be garnered and harnessed for this purpose.

Art ‚Äì Dead Man‚Äôs Curve has been way over done.
 And the Cliffs of Insanity, well, no.
 Jim - What happens to be wrong with the Cliffs of Insanity?
 Art ‚Äì Nothing, they‚Äôre just not really all that deadly.
 I mean what a misnomer, they‚Äôre only five feet high at their tallest, and for the most part they only stand two or three feet in height.
 And then they don‚Äôt exactly qualify as cliffs with their gentle incline and all.
 I wonder what idiot was allowed to name them cliffs in the first place, Don Quixote?
 Jim ‚Äì They‚Äôre the best we have.
 Art ‚Äì Well they‚Äôre not good enough for our purpose, so we might as well not even bother with that option.
 Jim ‚Äì Good thing school is starting again soon.

His touch lingered and I glanced down, surprised to see he had a firm grip on the necklace but wasn‚Äôt lifting it, couldn‚Äôt lift it.
 I looked to the council leaders as the guard turned toward the table and decisively stepped away from me.
 ‚ÄúThe crystal will not be removed,‚Äù he said.
 Though he spoke only to the elders, it set into motion behind us a wave of murmurs that filled the room, reverberating up the high ceiling.
 A council elder silenced the witnesses and then trained on me.
 ‚ÄúWho instructed you in fusion?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt have an answer.
 I‚Äôd never heard of fusion.
 I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do, and I looked toward Chevelle out of desperation.
 He was watching me, surprise clear on his face.
 Whatever I‚Äôd been accused of, he hadn‚Äôt expected it.

It had a tail and curled around the branch so it could rest its middle.
 Emily watched it and its beauty; she didn't think that something this pretty could be found in a place so dark and full of death.

 ‚ÄúHi, what are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúAn augothas.‚Äù it replied and fluttered its wings.
 ‚ÄúAre you a half-ling?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, how did you know?

 ‚ÄúWell you can't be a faery because you don't have the ears and you can't be a pixie because they're always giggling around.
 How can you understand me?‚Äù Emily shrugged.

There was no way I could've known that the gray monster who casually sliced through walls and two-by-fours with his wickedly curved claws was Brandon, but I was somehow certain.
 He was built just like Alec had been Friday night, only so much bigger that he had to crouch forward to avoid hitting his head on the unusually high ceilings.
 Donovan faced off against one of the first wolves, but it was obvious he was no match for the grace and power of his opponent.
 The gentle, aging butler was knocked to the ground between one heartbeat and the next.
 I was mercifully spared from seeing the wreckage left when Brandon's wolves moved on, but there was no doubt in my mind that Donovan was dead.
 Screams, distant enough that they had to be coming from the other wing of the house, reached out and pierced my heart.
 There wasn't any way to be sure whether or not it was Rachel or her mother, but ultimately it didn't really matter.
 Brandon was going to kill all of us.
 Another door caved in under a blow from Brandon's fist, and I suddenly realized that he was now standing in the Lilac Room.
 "Spread out and find her."

 He was still backing away, holding his hands in front of him palms out.
 A wordless hiss escaped my throat as I felt the fire coursing through me light in my hands.
 He would burn for this.
 Burn.
 I was standing now, walking step for step toward him as he backed away.
 He said nothing, his face calm as the fire flared and I raised my hands to strike.
 And then everything went black.

"Do you have a minute?"
 Happy to be able to do something, I hurried over and took a look at her open book.
 "Fractions, huh?"
 "Yeah, I'm supposed to reduce them after I finish adding, but I can't seem to get to the same answer as the book on this one."
 She'd transposed a couple of the numbers when working on one of the intermediate steps.
 "Here it is, you've changed the numbers here, it should be fourteen sixty-fifths, not fourteen fifty-sixths."
 Rachel's skin was several shades darker than mine, tan enough that it didn't show embarrassment as easily, but it still looked like she'd gone the slightest bit red.
 "Oh, I'm sorry to bug you with such a stupid mistake."
 "Don't worry about it.
 I'm just glad it was that easy.

I wasn't any less shocked, but his tone was so apologetic I couldn't help but smile.
 "That's better; I much prefer the happy Adri face to the scared Adri."
 "Wait, you could see me smile?
 I guess that all follows, better hearing, better sense of smell.
 Of course you'd have better vision too."
 It wasn't until I heard the note of longing in my voice that I realized what I was missing.
 Alec didn't have that same advantage, and I could feel him waiting expectantly.
 "Sorry, it's just that this all makes me think of these amazing dreams I've been having since I arrived.
 I'm transported to various places, but in every case I can hear and smell better than I can in real life.
 Not only that, everything is glowing.

When she returned to the house nearly half an hour later, she stormed past him and up to her room.
 Rick knew for sure that she was mad this time, knew why, and knew he'd been wrong to do what he'd done.
 "Sweetheart, I'm sorry," he called running after her.
 "I shouldn't have done it.

 Going upstairs to knock on it, he called, "Marie, please come out and talk to me."
 He paused.

I was halfway through History before I realized there'd been something odd about the discussion at Brandon's table.
 Luckily, Mr. Simms started out the class in usual form.
 It was virtually guaranteed we wouldn't learn anything which was fortunate or I might have missed something.
 Once my mind latched on the question of what had been different than normal, I didn't hear a word anyone else said.
 It wasn't until I was back at my locker and midway between switching out my History book for my Physics notes that I finally realized what it was.
 Normal juniors didn't sit at a lunch table and figure out what to do about anything.
 They complained, they gossiped, they boasted about what they were going to do, but it was all just an exercise designed to reinforce the social order.
 I'd seen it played out in multiple grades, among groups ranging from the jocks down to the lunatic fringe, and while the details changed, the overall form didn't.
 It was a universal constant, like the speed of light or maybe gravity.
 Only Brandon's group hadn't been gossiping.

They had grown fuzzy around their edges; it‚Äôs difficult to describe how they clung to each other in a desperate way as if they didn‚Äôt know where one ended and the other began.
 It was more than teenage passion driving them to that; it was dependence, an unhealthy co-dependence.
 They couldn‚Äôt meet anyone‚Äôs eyes; their pinpoint pupils darted around the room when I spoke to them.
 They couldn‚Äôt answer simple questions coherently.
 They babbled and told those outrageous stories.
 They were sick.
 When my wife and I heard sirens or the phone rang late at night, we always thought the worst.
 Certain police or crime television shows would give us lumps in our throats as we would silently look at each other and know we were thinking the same thing‚Ä¶ that might be our son.
 One afternoon while I was at work, Lisa was trying to help Brandon out by organizing some of his bills.
 Brandon told her that he needed to run a quick errand.

 Some never got any recognition, yet they fed the stream, they kept the mojo alive.
 Bluesmen who played because playing was what they did.
 Making ruckus.
 They didn‚Äôt have record contracts, they never made money.
 They played for fifty bucks a night, some beer, a little pussy.

I tell her to just come to my truck and let‚Äôs get this deal done.
 Ashley states she is suspicious that I won‚Äôt drive a hundred yards to meet her.
 I make a judgment call that I know will not make the undercover narcotics team happy but she is right, what is my great reason justifying not driving a short distance?
 I tell her I will drive right over and park by the Starbucks.
 I hang up with her and I state into my wire that we are moving to the Starbucks and to deal with it.
 My head set rings from my personal cell phone and the lead officer is a combination of irritated and understanding but he warns me to drive slowly and not to get too far in front of the van which will be coming in behind me.
 I am already backing up as he speaks to me.
 I am told to park against something, a wall or a spot in front of a store but not to park in the middle of the lot leaving all sides open.
 I notice the surveillance van coming up one of the isles as I pull onto the same path the Dodge Charger took which leads directly to the Starbucks.
 The van pulls in behind me at a comfortable distance.

He knew the depth of his lack of true courage from his years of failure to act before now.
 He went through the guardroom and was happy to see that Captain Poir had followed orders; there was no sign of the eight or so prisoners, including his rescued AElfin maiden.
 He stared at the problem in the largest cell.
 There, sprawled on the floor, were the two female Dire Cats that had been used to trap the Celestial lion.
 Rodregas swore that as soon as he looked at the cats, they were already looking at him straight in the eye.
 The large green eyes demanded something of him even as the animals lay in apparent complete relaxation, sprawled on the stone floor.
 He had to let them out, but how was he going to do that?
 If he simply opened the door, they might tear him apart.
 Rodregas thought the cats may also attack the guard at the front gate on their way out.
 He looked around and realized that the other side of the hall had a door that opened in the same direction as the door leading to the cage.

But it had, and there were more than four dozen roses scattered around our kitchen to prove it.
 Predictably, Brandon didn't do anything halfway.
 I'd gone to school on Tuesday after receiving his amazing, 'anonymous' gift the day before, only to be ambushed at lunch.
 I'd been anxiously waiting for him at his normal table when a pair of employees from the local florist had walked in, their arms overflowing with roses.
 I'd been expecting them to stop in front of Jasmin.
 Instead they'd passed her up and then declined to make a beeline to Cassie either.
 When they'd started handing the flowers to me, I'd tried to convince them there'd been some kind of mistake.
 The sound of 'One Day More' playing on the cell phone nestled in the closest bouquet had been what finally convinced me it was all meant for me.
 Brandon's voice had been like silk caressing my face when I'd answered the phone.
 One minute I was minding my own business trying to pretend like I didn't notice the nasty looks some of Brandon's friends were shooting my way when they thought I wasn't looking, the next I was going to the biggest dance of the year with the most popular guy in school.

He snatched his swords and sheathed them.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make you pay for that.‚Äù
 After a bit of debate, he decided not to tell Qurrah.
 Velixar had already made it clear they needed to be careful.
 Now he understood why.
 He wouldn‚Äôt tell Aurelia, either.
 That would be stupid, and stupid he was not‚Ä¶‚Äåmost of the time.
 ‚ÄúI need a drink,‚Äù he said, turning toward the town and trudging back.
 All he could think about was getting a good, stiff drink.
 If he was lucky, he might get in a good bar fight.

‚ÄúFor if you are safe, then I am not.‚Äù
 He crept down the stairs, the whip coiled and ready to burst into flame.
 Before the circular front window stood an elf, one hand on the glass, the other holding a bow.
 Qurrah reached into his pocket, clutching a few pieces of bone.
 Before he could draw them out the elf spoke, his voice soft and sad.
 ‚ÄúToo much death this day,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúFor hundreds of years my brother and I lived here, and for hundreds of years more we would have remained.
 He is dead now, and for what reason?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúDeath has no reason,‚Äù Qurrah said, his whole body tensing.
 ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the elf said, turning around so he could stare at Qurrah eye to eye.

Arms exports to areas identified by the UN as trouble spots should be banned by international law.
 An independent agency should be established to verify the submissions from arms-exporting states.
 Major arms exporters should agree to consult the Security Council in advance about large orders received for destabilizing weapons and, where appropriate, coordinate actions to limit the size of arms transfers.
 11.Narcotic drug production and trafficking must be treated as threats to international peace and security.
 The strongest possible sanctions should be instituted under the UN against countries that permit or support these activities.
 UN forces must be made available to assist member countries with eradication of these activities within their borders.
 Economic measures must be supported internationally to provide attractive commercial alternatives to drug growers through special trade agreements for agricultural commodities.
 International criminal proceedings should be instituted against violators under a new International Criminal Code.
 12.The UN should create its own international surveillance system, including its own satellites, to monitor and report on potential trouble spots and troop movements.
 It should also develop its own appropriate and effective logistics units.

She leapt into his arms, laughing and crying.
 "Marie."
 He buried his face in her hair, tears spilling into it.
 She began covering his face with kisses.
 "I was so afraid that I wouldn't be able to get back to you.
 "How long have you been trying?"
 "Just this morning.
 Yesterday it occurred to me that if you were thinking about me the way I was thinking about you, you might open the door.
 I told my parents good-bye last night, but I really didn't know if I'd ever be able to get back.
 But here you were, thinking about me!"

"Thank you," she said, raising her lips to his.
 She seemed to have recovered, Rick mused as he watched her try on white sandals half an hour later.
 He never would have believed he could enjoy shopping, but he loved watching her discover new styles and new toys.
 He'd bought her a pocket calculator on the way to the shoe store.
 They were going to Teri's for dinner the next evening, and Marie showered and put on her new white dress and sandals when they got back from the shore.
 "How do I look?"
 she asked Rick when she joined him downstairs.
 "Beautiful."
 She was even darker than she'd been yesterday when she'd tried on the dress, and the contrast the dress made with her hair and skin was striking.
 "I can see where you two have been," Teri said when they arrived at her townhouse.

The orcs roared at the sight, not at all upset at their own losses.
 The way into the city was clear.
 Axes and swords held high, they rushed the opening.
 ‚ÄúA minor skirmish,‚Äù Qurrah chuckled, echoing the elf‚Äôs words.
 ‚ÄúHow amusingly wrong.‚Äù
 Harruq had anticipated watching the fight over the wall from the roof, but instead they turned and watched the orcs slam into the human forces that surrounded the opening.
 The first push was brutal.
 Screams of pain and the sound of clashing of metal on metal flowed into the city.
 Harruq watched an orc wielding two swords cut off the arm of one soldier, and, as the blood from the limb splattered across his face, he turned and decapitated another with two vicious hacks.
 The orc roared in victory only to die as a soldier shoved his sword in his side and out his back.

 I think he had known her for about four hours at the time, and he was already in love.

I would like to thank Chris Tillman for encouraging me to turn my cathartic writings into a book to share my story with others.
 I would like to thank my mother for being the best mother she could be despite astronomical obstacles that faced a single parent in the 60‚Äôs with no financial support from her first husband and an abusive second husband.
 Mom, we never knew how hard life was for you because you made sure we came first and you protected us the best you could!
 To my son Bryce, I would like to thank you for all of your accomplishments and helping me as a father not have a complete melt down because at least I knew I wasn‚Äôt a complete failure as a Dad.
 You gave me the hope and courage to continue to try to understand your brother and his drug addiction and eventually the addiction of others.
 And a special Thank You to my editor, Robin Martin of Two Songbirds Press, for believing in my story and my ability to convey it.
 I couldn‚Äôt have completed this without you!
 Part I: Defining Moments Chapter 1: The Medicine Cabinet I sit alone in my new quad truck with its 22-inch rims; it looks like some 20-year-old spoiled brat has decked it out.
 I am tucked away in a remote parking space at a retail shopping center.
 No one would normally park this far from the grocery store, which anchors an array of businesses, at least not this late at night in this sparsely populated lot.

 Except maybe Zappa who seems to embrace the concept of bootleg albums.

 CM:  	What‚Äôs on it, and how did these recordings get circulated?
 BG: 	 Well, the how is easy.
 Tapes get stolen, recorders are snuck into concerts.

When I finally walked into the library, I remembered why I didn‚Äôt go there to study lineages.
 There must have been a thousand volumes and tenfold more scrolls in the main level alone.
 And I had no magic to lead me in the right direction.
 I went to the section which would most likely house the desired information, and then closed my eyes and concentrated.
 Maybe it wouldn‚Äôt work, but I could try.
 I wasn‚Äôt sure I felt anything, but after a few minutes I imagined my right hand might have tingled a little.
 I grabbed a close volume and leafed through it.
 It was a legacy of the Viridian Forest clan.
 I pulled another volume down.
 A diary of Momar the Ancient.

He looked up at Rodregas with a confused expression and asked, ‚ÄúDo you know what this is?‚Äù ‚ÄúNot really, I found it in Raven Keep.
 It felt of magic so I took it.
 I thought it might be worth something.‚Äù Jordaan smiled and laughed as he said, ‚ÄúWorth something indeed.
 This is a minor Sigil of Healing.‚Äù It was Rodregas who gasped this time and said, ‚ÄúInfernals!
 We had a Sigil of Healing all this time?
 If we had inscribed this sigil back at the farm we would never have needed your help.‚Äù Jordaan nodded at the truth of Rodregas‚Äô words and the two of them quickly gathered the others.
 All agreed that no matter what might happen with the greater sigils that all should gain the minor Sigil of Healing.
 Its benefits to warriors and mages alike were well known.
 Jordaan agreed to do the inscribing and show the others the technique.
 In return Imeralda would inscribe Jordaan who was also eager for the sigil.

Can I call you back in half an hour?"
 Mom stood there with the phone up against her ear for several seconds before shaking herself and looking at me.
 "That was some kind of promoter.
 She wants me to go out and shoot a fashion show in Paris.
 For a week and a half, and then another one in Italy.
 I've never heard of either of the shows, but she's offering me twenty thousand dollars for just three weeks."
 I felt my eyes go wide at the idea of something so unbelievable happening to us, and then even wider as I realized this must be what Alec had been referring to.
 'Convince her it's fine for her to leave' indeed.
 He hadn't been kidding about getting us out of the country.
 "Mom, you have to go!

I flexed my fist.
 ‚ÄúAh, she escaped,‚Äù Ruby purred.
 ‚ÄúAnd you didn‚Äôt trust me with her.‚Äù The formation broke as Steed came to stand beside me, the corner of his mouth tipping into a grin.
 I stared at the group.
 I had no idea who they were, but from the way they spoke it was apparently no secret I was Chevelle‚Äôs prisoner.
 Or his property.
 ‚ÄúFrey,‚Äù Chevelle said, ‚Äúthis is Anvil.‚Äù He nodded toward a giant of a man who bowed his head respectfully.
 ‚ÄúAnd Grey.‚Äù The wiry man bent and straightened, his movements too quick.
 I drew in a startled breath as two more figures came into view.
 A pair of slender elves stepped in sync as they stopped just outside the group.

I nicknamed the phone my ‚Äúcrack-berry.‚Äù After getting crucial information and doing a bit of research, I found the Craigslist classified advertisement with a picture of a young blond girl offering massages with a contact phone number that matched the drug dealer Steve‚Äôs number.
 The pictures in the ad were racy and the price per session was about twice the normal cost for such services.
 I called to set up a ‚Äúmassage.‚Äù I told her I got massages often for my ailing back but I thought it would be fun to get a massage from a pretty young lady.
 We scheduled an appointment for later that same day.
 I‚Äôve had back problems in the past, as many 50 year olds do, so I dug up a back support and I wore it to the appointment.
 I had a basic plan and an obvious goal but how it would unfold was a mystery.
 She met me at the door, dressed in casual sweats and no make-up.
 Despite looking a little weary, she looked like she could be very attractive if she tried.
 As I looked at her, I felt sorry for her because I knew she was about the same age as my sons and I knew she was somebody‚Äôs daughter, somebody‚Äôs baby and I also knew the sordid details of her existence.
 She led me into a surprisingly clean bedroom that had a complete bedroom set and a mirrored closet door was beside the bed.

 Today it didn't seem quite as bad, as long as I didn't think of her actual name.
 "Mom, I don't want to be late.

 Now it was her turn to look guilty and fidget just a little bit.
 "Actually, that's why I wanted to talk to you this morning.
 I've been shooting that new place I left you the note about.
 The one that bunch of kids your age told me about.
 Anyways, it's the best place I've found so far.

I can‚Äôt tell you who that really is.
 CM:  	Ok, um, the next song on Rain and Other Distractions, the penultimate song, before the finisher, ‚ÄúGoodbye to the Shell,‚Äù is this odd little folk song, ‚ÄúRight on Poplar Avenue.‚Äù
 BG: 	Yeah, that‚Äôs Lor‚Äôs song, actually.
 Well, I mean, she didn‚Äôt write it, except in the sense that she‚Äôs inside my head like no one else.
 That song stems from a conversation we were having about the past, about the future.

 I mean, it‚Äôs that Zen thing, you know?
 You wanna stay present, but the past keeps intruding.

I picked up the pace as Aunt Fannie‚Äôs curses came screaming through the closed door.
 She was determined not to let me forget what a burden it had been to take me in, even if it used every spare ounce of energy to do it.
 My mouth twisted, and I shifted into a run until I reached the little outcropping of rock on the west side of the village.
 I was still thinking about it when I slowed to climb through the tangle of brush in back of Junnie‚Äôs house, but once my fingers trailed the cool rock surrounding the structure, it fell away.
 When it felt as if I could breathe again, I rapped two quick knocks and then one loud knock on the small wooden door.
 It was the one sure way she‚Äôd know it was me.
 A wisp of bright blonde hair swirled around Junnie‚Äôs shining eyes as the door swung open, and I decided I must have caught her working; she looked flustered.
 Junnie was older than I, but remained striking with the blonde hair, blue eyes, and thin features that seemed to be standard-issue among the village elves.
 The Council had assigned her as my tutor, citing my advanced age as the reason I couldn‚Äôt learn with the others, but I suspected it was my stunning lack of ability that had landed me here.
 Junnie brushed a lock of hair aside.

Qurrah was awake when he returned.

 The larger half-orc shrugged.
 ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt need them.‚Äù
 Harruq went to the other side of the house and started punching holes in the walls.
 Qurrah might have inquired further but he was lost in his own secret.
 The night didn‚Äôt come soon enough for either of the two brothers.
