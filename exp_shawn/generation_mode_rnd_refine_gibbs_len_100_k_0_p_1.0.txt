And when the heroine shot the villain, causing his jacket to catch on fire, Marie screamed.
 It was so real, and she gripped the edge of her seat as she waited to see what would happen after he fell into the water.
 The villain jumped up on the platform to make his bows with the rest of the cast.
 Marie raised wide eyes to Rick's face as they stood to leave.
 "Was that man who was on fire hurt?"
 "No.
 He'll do another show in a couple of hours."
 "How do they do that?"
 "The jacket is made out of some kind of special material."
 That was the most amazing stunt she saw that day, but there were dozens of special effects and props that filled her with wonder.

When she pressed her breasts against me I was gone, man.
 And I had this erection, it was beyond human somehow, hard as anthracite‚Äîyou could hang your coat on it (laughs) and she worked her hand around me like a necromancer casting a spell.
 Just her fingers over me were like cool water.
 Jesus.
 I can‚Äôt.
 Let‚Äôs just say, that after the preliminaries, which took hours, days maybe, she sat on me, and I entered her, and she was hot like sulfur, like a volcano.
 Tophet.
 Her cunt was hot, and I fell so deeply into her that I haven‚Äôt come out yet.
 Can you dig that?
 I haven‚Äôt come out yet.

2.Comprehensive, human-centred theory of development: An important shift in thinking has taken place from regarding development primarily in terms of economic growth to greater emphasis on the human welfare and development of people.
 But development is not only a set of goals or material achievements ‚Äì it is a social process by which human beings progressively develop their capacities and release their energies for higher levels of material achievement, social and cultural advancement, and psychological fulfilment.
 New theory is needed that focuses on the dynamic role of information, attitudes, social institutions and cultural values in the development process.
 An international effort should be initiated at the forthcoming UN Social Summit to evolve a comprehensive, human-centred theory of individual and social development that will lead to the formulation of more effective strategies to accelerate the development process.
 UNDP's approach to human security and sustainable development is an important contribution to this effort.
 3.Social organization index: It is now widely recognized that a country's social organization or 'social capital' is a key determinant of its development.
 Measures and indices such as UNDP's Human Development Index that provide a comparative national assessment of progress on key dimensions of development generate greater awareness and stimulate greater political will and social initiative to improve performance.
 In a similar manner, UNDP should commission a programme to construct a Social Organization or Social Capital Index consisting of one or more scales to measure the organizational development of countries covering major sectors such as commerce, industry, agriculture, education, health care, and technical training.
 The index should evaluate the level of social organization in terms of its overall support to activities in each of these fields as well as the number and quality of institutions providing this support.
 Where objective measures are not possible, a rank or relative scale will suffice.

They camped within a sparse copse of trees, the trunks not nearly thick enough to hide their approach.
 ‚ÄúThey are wise and alert,‚Äù he whispered.
 ‚ÄúPerhaps I can get close enough to cast a spell on one or two.
 They are on flat ground, so I see no way to ambush them.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúThen why don‚Äôt we just walk over, say hello, and then whack ‚Äôem?‚Äù Harruq asked.
 ‚ÄúMy dear brother,‚Äù Qurrah said, ‚Äúthat is a very good question.‚Äù
 Brazenly, they approached the campfire.
 They kept their weapons sheathed and hidden.
 The closer they got before the men panicked the better.
 ‚ÄúHalt, who goes there?‚Äù one of the guards shouted to them as they neared.

There the prisoner, now empty of his own essence, stood still.
 As the blue fire was sucked into his body, the corporal body suddenly seemed more solid than before.
 Once more Ravenhurr yelled out in his melodious voice the trigger words for the next part of the ritual, ‚ÄúMana faria podia ricoria.‚Äù It was now or never for Rodregas to strike.
 Rodregas raised his arm up and threw his club forward with all his strength.
 There was no time to see if his club hit Junnit or if the half AElfin maiden ran.
 Rodregas half ran and half jumped to the next circle, where Ravenhurr stood with raised arms.
 Ravenhurr was focused on his inner magic and was not prepared for his own guards‚Äô sudden action.
 Rodregas grabbed Ravenhurr‚Äôs arm and his belt, and using his weight and momentum against Ravenhurr, threw him bodily into the circle of colorful crystals where the half AElf maiden had stood moments ago.
 Ravenhurr, in an amazing act of balance, almost caught himself.
 He seemed to defy gravity as he hung in the air.

He would need to carry as much food as possible as well.
 He quickly went back into the main keep and wrapped up the mattress from Captain Poir‚Äôs bunk and started carrying barrels of flour and other foodstuffs to his pile next to the front entrance.
 The drudge stared at him with a strange look but did not question his actions.
 He then realized that he should go up and check out the laboratory for anything else of value, and check out the dungeon to make sure all the prisoners had been freed.
 He had brought a proper crow bar from his visit to the smith‚Äôs and made short work of the laboratory door.
 The room had several large circles in the floor and tables and shelves along the side.
 The shelves held bones and bowls of strange fluids and other items whose uses he could not imagine.
 Anything that felt foul he threw into the fireplace, after getting a good flame going.
 Several books and strange containers ended up in the fire, though he did find two books that felt of magic that he kept.
 He also found a small statue of a strange green mechanical frog that had that magic tingle to it.

I was still musing over the injustice of it all when Alec shifted me around so I was held in just one arm.
 "There's something I'd like you to have.
 Something I hope will help you remember what you mean to me..." He trailed off, and then seemingly at a loss for words, reached out and lifted the black velvet that'd been covering the painting.
 Another graceful gesture flipped on the set of soft lights surrounding its border.
 As always with Alec's paintings, it took me a second before I could shift my perspective enough to translate the beautiful formations of light into something I could tie to the drab, dreary world I inhabited.
 It was the same grotto where we now stood.
 The warm glow from the climbing ivory and roses formed a backdrop awash in the silvery light of a full moon.
 Just visible off to one side was the pool, alive with enough microscopic life to give it a pale glow of its own to compliment the off-center reflection of a hundred tiny lights.
 A few seconds later I finally recognized that the subject of the piece was a female, reaching out towards the point of view with glowing hands.
 "She's beautiful.

Sex toys filled the drawers and around his bed.
 Apparently, it had been a real bohemian festival at some point, at least to the people who hung here.
 Everything was broken or ajar, apparently ransacked while Brandon was in jail.
 Nearly all of his belongings that were worth anything were stolen by the scumbags who had been his peers.
 We heard Brandon‚Äôs girlfriend, Tiffanie, was afraid to return to the house while our son was in jail and it was probably the smartest thing she had done in years.
 Brandon had accumulated flat screen TV‚Äôs, computers, stereo equipment, guns, you name it and it was all gone.
 Most of it, if not all of it was drug trade merchandise or purchased with drug sale money before his drug habit escalated to the point that his addiction was larger than he could support with his sales.
 The area under the rental house had been dug out and reinforced to grow indoor marijuana.
 It resembled an escape tunnel from a prison movie.
 None of this was intended for the eyes of a parent.

I hate that.
 I hate that I sing a song and then they come in and lay some harpsichord or Jew‚Äôs harp or whatever behind it.
 But, that‚Äôs the times, man, I gotta go with the times.
 Still, I insist on a certain honesty, a certain interplay in the studio, and this places me solidly on the outside.
 A pain in the ass, that‚Äôs what these label guys think I am.

 What‚Äôs a fight with an engineer compared with the song itself, right?
 I gotta be true to the song.

Chevelle watched them until they spun to disappear, and then he turned to me.
 One look at his face and I knew the cause of the devastation.
 I still couldn‚Äôt remember, but I knew what I had heard was truth.
 My mother had killed his family, his entire clan.
 He‚Äôd been there in the village in my dreams, in my memories.
 He had saved me.
 His family was there as well.
 The people running and screaming and dying were his clan.
 I knew the cloaks in that vision now, too.
 They were Grand Council.

The pull of fragmentation cannot be countered solely at the political level.
 Education ‚Äì both formal and public ‚Äì is the best means for rapidly communicating and imparting the benefits of integration to the largest numbers of people.
 In order fully to harness cultural potentials for development, we need to understand better the natural process of value formation in society, to discover the circumstances and conditions under which new values are accepted, and the factors that retard or facilitate this process.
 In other words, we need to evolve a theory of value formation which will ultimately enable us to consciously identify and instil values that are most conducive and supportive of a peaceful, prosperous life for all humanity.
 The collective progress of humankind will achieve its maximum velocity when we have discovered how to consciously accelerate the process of values acquisition.
 The role of the UNESCO Commission on Culture and Development can make a valuable contribution to our understanding of this most important issue.
 Strategies for Developing Human Resourcefulness

‚ÄúFine, then don't complain.‚Äù She climbed into a small tree that was near the cliff she had spotted.
 She leaned back and let out a sigh of relief.
 Her legs were killing her but she wasn't going to tell Jason that.
 He got up and sat at the base of the tree.
 ‚ÄúYou had to take the good tree?‚Äù She motioned around.
 ‚ÄúThere are plenty of trees to pick from Jason.
 So pick one.‚Äù He mumbled something and closed his eyes.
 Emily shook her head.
 He was too stubborn sometimes.
 Emily stared at the sky and then she knew what he had said.

The arrow lodged into Harruq‚Äôs side, and then Salvation tore through his bow and into flesh.
 A kick sent the remains tumbling out the window.
 The other archer pulled back and fired at point blank range.
 Harruq roared as he felt a sharp pain bite into his neck.
 His mind blanked.
 He dropped his swords.
 His hands closed about something soft.
 By the time his rage calmed, blood was on his hands and the remains of an elf lay in the dirt below the window.
 ‚ÄúStupid elfie,‚Äù he said, gingerly touching the arrow in his neck.
 Not knowing what else to do, he closed his hand about the shaft and pulled.

I was talking again, without regard to thought.
 ‚ÄúHis mother died, too.
 We killed her.‚Äù It sounded so matter-of-fact, my head bobbing along with the words.
 I couldn‚Äôt seem to stop.
 My mouth opened to speak once more but I was suddenly swept up, off Steed‚Äôs lap and into Chevelle‚Äôs arms.
 I managed fear for half a second but then lost the feeling to dizziness, followed quickly by only dull numbness.
 Chevelle was laying me on my bed.
 ‚ÄúStay here.
 It will pass.‚Äù His words were gentle now, the anger gone.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I whispered.

Hers were more angular though, long and almost pointed at the tip.
 Neither of us matched the norm.
 Hers were one extreme, mine the other.
 She turned to look at me.
 ‚ÄúFeeling okay?‚Äù I remembered I was going to ask her something.
 I said, ‚ÄúMm-hmm,‚Äù and got lost in the hum of my reply.
 She smiled at my satisfied trance.
 I faded off to blackness then, though my dreams were vivid and wild.
 I was a hawk, flying high above the mountain.
 My wings stretched as I soared through an endless and open sky.

The next two hours floated by, and before I would've believed it possible, I found myself heading towards the tutoring lab.
 Rachel met me outside the door, her face lit up with a smile even more striking than her usual expression.
 "You won.
 I'm so excited that you won.
 Guess what.
 I traded tickets with Suzanne Bergerman, so we get to sit together!"
 Life couldn't get any better.
 I was going to Les Mis√©rables with Rachel, and I only had two more hours before Brandon would be taking me home.
 Chapter 16 My time with Brandon blurred by too quickly.
 It was like the time between when he picked me up and dropped me off didn't even exist.

I woke gasping from another dream of my mother and destruction.
 The rain had stopped, and the sun was rising, so I wiped the sweat from my brow and went to the hall pitcher to splash my face.
 The dark roots of my hair were stark in the mirror‚Äôs reflection, and I recalled the dream.
 The memories of my mother were fuzzy, but I‚Äôd always thought she‚Äôd had light hair, beautiful and golden like Junnie‚Äôs.
 In the dreams, it was black‚Ä¶ as black as the roots of my hair were now.
 I stood there for a long moment, staring at the darkness, and then spun as I made another stupid, rash decision.
 Slinking past Fannie‚Äôs room, I headed for her makeshift vault.
 She kept all the things I wasn‚Äôt allowed to touch in that room; it was supposed to be off limits.
 Not that I‚Äôd bothered trying much, because there was a large flat stone‚Äîcovering where it hid in the floor‚Äîthat I‚Äôd never been able to move.
 But that was before.

I traced the sticky metal rings and sighed.
 Emily was on her phone.
 I saw Seth and Jason arguing off to the side.
 Everything was back to normal.
 There was even a dwarf climbing the slide.
 Wait, hold on.
 A dwarf?
 I elbowed Emily in the arm, ‚ÄúUh Emily, is a dwarf using a slide a normal thing?‚Äù I nodded in the direction of the dwarf and her eyes widened in surprise.
 She jumped off the swing and grabbed me by the arm.
 She ran over to Jason and gripped his arm with her free hand, pulling us both after her.

I closed my eyes against the pain, trying to focus myself against the dull throb in my shin.
 Then the thrasher went limp against me.
 It was hauled off of my body and I found myself looking up into the face of a very unhappy dark blue haired boy.
 His sword was gripped tightly in his clenched fingers and a look of amusement, or many it was anger, shone on his face.
 I swallowed and collected my weapons from the ground, not daring to look at my leg.
 ‚ÄúHi Seth, this is unexpected.‚Äù Seth glared at me and pulled me up.
 He was definitely angry at me.
 I tried to place weight on my leg but winced as pain shot up it.
 He kicked the dead Thrasher one more time before sheathing his sword.
 ‚ÄúYou know better Jazell then to take on a monster by yourself.

He had worked there since he graduated the program and he assured me they would do their best to help Brandon.
 The facility where Brandon was staying was nearly a nine-hour drive from our home.
 We talked to Brandon on the phone occasionally and every time we did it was as if a cloud was slowly lifting and he was starting to think more clearly.
 He seemed to be growing up.
 He had never really matured like his younger brother because in his world of drugs he was not living reality.
 Easter was rolling around and we planned on visiting him with the family, but only if he completed certain parts of his program by Easter.
 If so, he would be allowed a LOA (Leave Of Absence) for the day.
 If not, we would have Easter with him at the facility.
 He would have been an inpatient for over two months by then, and the Narconon program would keep him as long as they needed until he was ready to graduate or until he left on his own.
 We could only hope that Brandon stayed with the program and left only when he had the tools to stay off the dope.

He went through the guardroom and was happy to see that Captain Poir had followed orders; there was no sign of the eight or so prisoners, including his rescued AElfin maiden.
 He stared at the problem in the largest cell.
 There, sprawled on the floor, were the two female Dire Cats that had been used to trap the Celestial lion.
 Rodregas swore that as soon as he looked at the cats, they were already looking at him straight in the eye.
 The large green eyes demanded something of him even as the animals lay in apparent complete relaxation, sprawled on the stone floor.
 He had to let them out, but how was he going to do that?
 If he simply opened the door, they might tear him apart.
 Rodregas thought the cats may also attack the guard at the front gate on their way out.
 He looked around and realized that the other side of the hall had a door that opened in the same direction as the door leading to the cage.
 He opened it up and thought that if he opened the Dire Cats‚Äô door, he could block them from this direction, while keeping himself safe behind the two doors.

A mortal must choose only one path; Celestial or Infernal.
 That is ‚ÄòThe One Law.‚Äô‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù asked Doi‚Äôvan, his deep voice sounding both menacing and curious.
 ‚ÄúNobody knows for sure,‚Äù said Jordaan.
 ‚ÄúThe Gods and Infernals do not explain their actions, but most believe that if someone had the full potential to tap into all three‚Ä¶ he would be stronger than either the Gods or the Greater Daemons.
 He would have the potential to rule all the realms and break the great balance.
 This is something that not even the Infernals want,‚Äù he added.
 Rodregas spoke, ‚ÄúSo if Ravenhurr, who was a friend of Taiga, was part of a group of Immortalists who are breaking ‚ÄòThe One Law‚Äô then he might have already added Hellborn power to his own.
 And when I took on Ravenhurr‚Äôs power, I also added the Infernal power, which is natural for a Hellborn.
 It could also be a reason that the gods answered my prayers and helped me succeed against Ravenhurr.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo the Gods might not be against all Immortalists, but just the ones who are tapping into the Infernal power?‚Äù asked Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúAll Immortalists deserve to die for their crimes,‚Äù Rodregas answered.

That night Harruq collected a bunch of sticks and twigs, which Qurrah lit with a clap of his hands.
 The two huddled over the fire, each lost in their thoughts.
 Harruq broke the silence first.
 ‚ÄúSo where will we go?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúWhere else is there?‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúPerhaps we were meant to go to Woodhaven.
 The journey will not be long, perhaps a week or two at most.
 There are enough animals about for me to kill, so do not worry about food.
 As for water, there are many small streams, and we can beg from the occasional farms we pass.
 We were to leave anyway, now we do so sooner.‚Äù

Her heart had sped up then but nothing like when he'd tilted her chin up and looked into her eyes.
 She'd known then that he was going to kiss her, but she'd been unable to turn away.
 And then his lips had touched hers.
 She shivered beneath the hot spray as she remembered the pleasure she'd felt.
 But that pleasure had frightened her, because it was wrong.
 She was betrothed to Davis.
 When she was dressed, she put her betrothal ring back on.
 She shouldn't have left it off last night.
 And she should have asked Rick to set an alarm for her so that she could have walked in the garden this morning.
 She shouldn't skip any mornings; she never knew which day might be the one when she'd find herself back in 1927.

Please, help us!‚Äù
 ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs two,‚Äù shouted one of the farmers.
 ‚ÄúThey killed my wife!
 You have to‚Ä¶‚Äù
 Their words trailed off once they were close enough to see clearly.
 Flesh hung from their bones, pale and rotting.
 Wounds spotted nearly every one, although no blood poured from them.
 Their saviors were men, orc, and elf, but they were dead.
 ‚ÄúAshhur help us,‚Äù an exhausted farmer murmured before the line advanced upon them.
 The Forest Butcher at their heels, they could not run.

I think without the bust, he could have got killed for stealing from other drug dealers or been captured in a larger bust that he couldn‚Äôt negotiate his way out of.
 I knew through our exchange of e-mails that most times he busted someone they ended up repeating the same behavior eventually ending up in prison or dead.
 After getting to know the officer I began to realize he was never a bad guy at all as he was just doing a thankless job, often with grim results that left him feeling like his was a fruitless effort to cleanse the streets of dealers and addicts.
 When I contacted Officer White and invited him and his Sergeant to meet Brandon and me for coffee he quickly agreed.
 The officers were amazed at how healthy Brandon looked and how mature he acted.
 Brandon greeted them with a handshake that turned into a hug.
 He thanked them.
 I think the arrest helped him realize how long the police had been after him and how much they knew about him and that dealers he knew were working for the police.
 After rehab when his head was clear, and he knew how close he came to dying or going to prison, I think he respected what the police were doing.
 By then, several more of his friends had died from an OD or were in rehab or prison.

Doi‚Äôvan immediately launched himself at the next slaver, and followed suit, slamming his opponent‚Äôs sword away and gutting him before he had a chance to move.
 Rodregas then went for the nearest Immortal Guard.
 Once again he followed up with the same move, stepping forward and slamming his shield forward to either knock his opponent‚Äôs weapon or knock the guard himself down.
 Unfortunately, when Rodregas hit this guard he matched his every move for move.
 The guard responded, slamming shield against shield.
 Rodregas had gotten too comfortable with his opponents not being able to match his strength.
 This guard did.
 The Immortal Guard had already launched himself forward and Rodregas‚Äô own speed worked against him.
 As Rodregas‚Äô short sword hit nothing but air, he felt the sharp agony of the guard‚Äôs blade piercing his thigh.
 Rodregas used his speed to throw himself back.

He pinned her to the car, pressing his body full length against hers.
 Marie gasped, her fingernails digging into his shoulders.
 She would never have dreamed that being pinned beneath Rick's body would feel so incredibly .

 incredibly .

 .
 She moaned, letting her head drop back against the roof of the car as he began kissing her neck.
 "I love you, Marie," he whispered, nuzzling her ear.

I knew I was very much in love with Eric.
 I thought of marriage, and that was when I saw what Eric was.
 He was the wind.
 You can't tie the wind up and put it in a house and make it love you.
 How I wanted to be with him until we were so old and fragile that I would have broken had he put his arm around me.
 "Even though I never had that, we had something much finer.
 We went to the beach many times and talked until we were too hoarse to say anything.
 I brought out things about him I thought I never could.
 We would run down the beach, I don't know where to, but we'd run and swim and laugh and laugh until we laughed at nothing at all.
 "And then summer ended.

It is not a beast of a realm, it is the symbol of the Nymph people.
 It can‚Äôt be a sigil, can it?‚Äù she asked.
 Neither Doi‚Äôvan nor Rodregas answered and the three of them stood there, each caught up in their own thoughts.
 Finally, Doi‚Äôvan spoke, ‚ÄúI am going to see what lies in this Chamber.
 Will you be alright?‚Äù he asked Imeralda.
 She nodded and seemed relieved as she headed right for the doorway of the One Tree.
 Rodregas feared for her.
 He was not sure what the consequences would be if she touched the One Tree.
 He wanted to follow her, but he followed Doi‚Äôvan into the Infernal chamber instead.
 ‚ÄúWas it his own Infernal power calling him?‚Äù He wondered.

It didn‚Äôt make sense.
 I knew I had been assigned a watcher.
 From the North.
 ‚ÄúNo one?‚Äù I asked.
 ‚ÄúNo.

 He was a volunteer.
 I seethed for a moment, but flashes of my mother and council cloaks flooded my thoughts and I had to block them.
 ‚ÄúSo the North‚Ä¶ has no council at all?‚Äù His answer was uncomfortable.

Maybe I should become a teacher.
 Rachel caught my eye before I made it back to my table.
 She gave me another tentative smile as I slid into the seat next to her.
 "I'm really sorry about yesterday.
 I said all of the wrong things.
 It's just I'm not supposed to talk about what Alec says."
 Wow, he sounded like even more of a jerk than I'd expected.
 Talk about controlling.
 "It's okay Rachel.
 I'm sorry I overreacted at finding out my attacks were public knowledge.

I started to feel like that, that I was a chimp, a dancing fool.
 This was like before The Moratorium, right?
 Before we really all felt the power.
 The War was just this endless one-note playing over and over and driving us insane‚Äîme insane, sorry, driving me insane.
 And, like, I know that a song is just a song‚Äîyet, I have to believe there is something there, an element, a catalytically charged element.
 I didn‚Äôt want religion‚Äîwho listens to priests, clergymen, even those who take to the streets?
 Ali has more power.
 Ali reaches more people.
 But a song, you know, a good song, well, it does tunnel deep into the consciousness.

I heard a grunt of effort, saw him stop moving, and only then realized it was Ben who'd nearly died.
 In the split second between Ben being gently placed back on the stairs, and everyone starting to breathe again, I followed the arm that'd saved him back to see who the hero was.
 Isaac met my gaze as he let go of Ben and then he looked up at Vincent with a stare that was somehow both calm and challenging at the same time.
 "What are you looking at, freak?"
 It was hard to believe Vincent could be so nonchalant after having almost killed someone.
 It'd been an accident obviously, but still that wasn't the kind of thing you just shook off.
 All of the kids that'd been rushing forward to congratulate Isaac for his heroic save started backing away.
 Anxious to avoid the fight, I tried to move with the crowd, but felt a flash of pain as my abused ankle protested.
 For a second I couldn't think about anything other than the agony.
 When I managed to get my eyes to focus again, Vincent was only a couple of inches away from Isaac and hissing something too quiet for me to make out.

The amount of hurt in his voice took him out of the category of frightening.
 I moved a little closer.
 "Do you still want me to leave?"
 "Do you want to leave?
 I won't stop you if you do.
 If you can convince your mom to leave town there's even a chance you'll be safe from Brandon."
 Shivers worked their way down my spine as some of the pieces clicked into place.
 "He's like you, isn't he?"
 Alec's laugh was a bitter, humorless thing.
 "You mean a monster?

She didn't begin composing until after he was gone."
 In what was for me a rare display of common sense over curiosity, I shelved the rest of my questions and looked for something I could use to help him sidestep the memories.
 "Growing up surrounded by this, and neither you or Rachel play an instrument?"
 Alec shook his head.
 "I've never had the finesse to play anything.
 Rachel took violin lessons for more than a year.
 I think she wanted to be able to play with mother.
 That was when she begged me to wire the house for sound.
 Donovan and I spent two weeks setting up mics in Mom's studio, and then another couple of weeks running sound into every other room of the house.
 She kept insisting it was so she could monitor Mother on the rare occasions when nobody else was home, but I used to hear her trying to play along to 'Courtship'."

I can do this.‚Äù As Rodregas raised the club, he kept his eyes away from the AElf maiden not wanting to give himself away to anyone watching.
 ‚ÄúGods,‚Äù Rodregas quietly prayed.
 ‚ÄúYou have never answered my prayers.
 I have never had much to give you as an offering of wealth to your temples, nor have I done great deeds in your names, but if any of you hate these life-stealing Immortalists as I do, then let me know your favor.‚Äù Rodregas could not help but add a selfish plea to his desperate prayer, ‚ÄúIf by your grace I live, then I promise you gods that I will make it my life‚Äôs duty to fight the Life Stealers.‚Äù Rodregas doubted his prayers would do any good, but if nothing else he was a practical man and when you are pushing the odds it never hurts to call in divine favor.
 Rodregas knew things would start moving quickly now.
 Ravenhurr had been preparing the circles for months, feeding them with unearthly energies.
 Ravenhurr had not wanted the prisoners up on the tower roof until the last moment, lest their fear lead them to take desperate action.
 Ravenhurr started to speak the final words of the spell, setting off months of careful preparations.
 Rodregas knew that sorcerers use ancient languages so that others who might be watching cannot understand what they are saying and guess their intent beforehand.
 During the practice walk-through the week before, Ravenhurr had spoken the same words that he started to utter now.

Alec sighed, but it wasn't an angry sigh, so I nodded, forgetting for a moment that he couldn't see me in the darkness.
 "We share a little in common with a bunch of different legends, but none get it quite right.
 In short, we're shape shifters, people who can take the form of animals."
 I'd already seen that for myself, but it was strangely exhilarating to hear him admit it.
 "You mean like werewolves?"
 There was a hiss of sound, as if I'd just hit him.
 For a second I worried I'd made him angry.
 "No, not like werewolves."
 I waited for him to elaborate.
 When the silence grew too uncomfortable I was the first to crack, just like always.

He caught her free hand and squeezed it until she looked up at him.
 "It's OK.  We're friends, we like each other--nothing should make us feel uncomfortable with each other, should it?"
 She smiled then.
 "Did they give us napkins?"
 They went to bed early that night because they had to be at Paramount at 7:00 the next morning.
 Marie, fortunately, didn't question the earliness of the hour.
 The surprise he had for her hinged on the word of a friend of a friend, and he didn't want her to find out about it and then have it fall through.
 Traffic was terrible the next morning, but he managed to find the gate he'd been told to go to.
 The attendant had his name on a list and gave him directions to stage three.
 "Why did your name have to be on a list?"

As much time as you spend studying and thinking about your classes, I'm surprised they haven't decided to graduate you a year early."
 I shrugged uncomfortably.
 Since Mom hadn't been interested in the things I could safely tell her without getting grounded, school had become a standard excuse for why I was so distracted.
 "Speaking of which, when do they send out mid-term reports?"
 "I think they do them twice here.
 We missed the first batch, and the second isn't until later."
 I still didn't particularly like lying, but seemed to be doing it more and more often.
 "Anyways, I was just apologizing for leaving you home alone on a weekend again.
 I ran into another trio of hikers, and they told me about a new vantage point for that crooked-looking mountain I keep telling you about.
 It's on the far side, so I'm going to hike as far in as I can while it's still light today so I can make it there tomorrow with plenty of time before sunset.

Safety Nets: Long-term solution to the problem of food security requires efforts that will make people food self-sufficient.
 But until those efforts can be put in place and made effective, continued reliance will have to be placed on public programmes such as India‚Äôs highly successful Mid-Day Meal scheme for school children and Food for Work programs that combine employment and food security.
 The traditional concept of Food for Work needs to be enlarged to include skilled work related to human and social development.
 A Global Food Guarantee scheme should be put in place, which combines Food for Work and Employment Guarantee in a systematic manner.
 Human Development
 Development is a human process.
 It is the result of human aspirations turned into action, human energies expressed in thought and work, human imagination and creativity turned toward the upliftment of life, the invention of processes and products to enhance human productivity, the accumulation of knowledge and wisdom passed on from one generation to another, the acquisition and perfection of skills transmitted from parent to child, the conversion of talents into capacities, the pursuit of ideals, an ever widening of attitudes, and the evolution of more complex and productive forms of organization.
 As this evolutionary process unfolds, each element of human personality -- physical skill, vital relationship, mental understanding, spiritual values ‚Äì is enhanced in a progression without end, bringing with it greater material fruits, richer life experience, and higher knowledge.
 The unfolding and flowering of the human being is at once the source and the goal of development.
 Thus, in all our efforts to elevate human society, our primary endeavour must be to enhance these human endowments and expand individual freedom of self-expression.

I needed to give him a reason to stay interested in me, but nothing came to mind.
 As we pulled to a stop, the quiet hum of a cellphone on vibrate broke the strange paralysis that'd gripped me for the last twenty seconds.
 Brandon's grin was more than a little sheepish as he fished his phone out of a front pocket and checked to see who was calling.
 I didn't need his groan to know it was one of his friends.
 A selfish urge to try and make him ignore the call and continue to focus on me momentarily flared up, but I suppressed it.
 It was such a petty thing to do, and even worse was probably the quickest way to demolish whatever interest he might have towards me.
 I might be almost completely naive when it came to dating, but anyone who'd read more than a couple books, or sat through eight or nine chick flicks, totally knew that the quickest way to drive a guy off was to become controlling and manipulative.
 Unless maybe you were a cheerleader and you were talking about a guy who was used to dating cheerleaders.
 Which while I wasn't even close to the former, the latter actually described Brandon almost perfectly.
 I almost stopped midway through the action of opening my car door, but it was too late.

I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be easy because as it turns out she knew of me through high school and my reputation preceded me.
 Would this ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù give her number to a ‚Äúbad boy?‚Äù The ploy worked and somehow Lisa agreed to let me call her.
 Lisa had been dating a guy for years and I knew of him.
 He had attended our high school and he was the quarterback of the football team (my polar opposite).
 She had only come to the club the night I met her because she was angry with her boyfriend because he choose to spend Valentine‚Äôs Day with his brother playing basketball (take notes boys).
 She had called a friend who told her she could get her into this bar because she knew the bartender and they were both under legal drinking age.
 Lisa was 20.
 She was a ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù and hadn‚Äôt ever done anything like that.
 She had no intention of breaking up with her boyfriend.
 I looked her square in her beautiful blue eyes and I told her flatly, ‚ÄúYou are going to fall so in love with me that you will not even remember this guy‚Äôs name!‚Äù We were married three years later.

Technological development propels a spiral of economic development that creates many more jobs than it destroys.
 The most striking testimony to this fact is the history of employment in USA, arguably the country that has most readily and fully adopted new technologies over the past century.
 Employment in manufacturing and mining grew to a peak of about 40 per cent of the workforce after World War II before beginning its downward spiral to 15 per cent by 2000, about the same proportion as in 1850.
 Yet, during this same period total employment in America has expanded phenomenally, from a mere 13 million workers in 1870 to 68 million in 1955 and more than 136 million in 2002.
 In spite of all the automation and all the export of jobs to lower wage economies, the percentage of the American population employed has continued to rise over time.
 Several factors are responsible for this result, among which population growth and technological development are most prominent.
 Rising levels of technological sophistication certainly displace workers in most fields of manufacturing.
 But at the same time they stimulate growth of employment in many different ways ‚Äì increasing demand for the products thus manufactured by a factor of 10, 100 or even 1000 fold as in the case of automobiles, TVs, cell phones and computers; increasing the demand for research workers to support technological innovation and for teachers to meet the rising demand for education; and rising living standards, which increases consumption of other goods and services due to the falling prices made possible by rising productivity.
 Over the past two decades the US economy lost nearly 4 million manufacturing jobs but added a net 37 million jobs through expansion of the service sector, which now accounts for 84 per cent of total employment.
 It is time that we stop resisting or resenting this trend, but rather strive to adapt by shifting our focus toward those fields of employment which are most directly stimulated by technological innovation.

Within two decades of his accession he challenged the All-Father All√≥d for control of the Celestial Pantheon of the Gods.
 Accerntorino claimed he could better lead them to victory over the Daemon Lords of the Infernal Realm.
 But All√≥d quickly and soundly defeated the upstart Accerntorino.
 What still caused whispers almost 400 years later was his fate; the All-Father had destroyed him.
 Everyone knew stories of various gods that had challenged All√≥d over the millennia.
 The punishments he had dealt some were horrible and some simply funny or embarrassing.
 A few times he had even driven Gods to join the fallen Daemon Lords in the Infernal Realm.
 But the All-Father did not kill any of these other challengers.
 It was his duty to support the Pantheon, even when they betrayed him.
 Yet his reaction to this newly created god, this incredibly powerful, magic-wielding new immortal, was to simply kill him; and that was the end of it.

‚ÄúOh, we‚Ä¶ took the weapons as salvage.
 It has helped to pay for your healing and equipping of the people you rescued.
 As their rescuers you were, of course, responsible for getting them properly outfitted and on their way back to their homes.‚Äù Rodregas sat shocked for a moment and then he just exploded.
 ‚ÄúWHAT!
 You can‚Äôt do that.
 Do you have any idea how much we need that gear?
 We bled for it!
 We put our lives at risk to rescue Imeralda‚Äôs people, and all we ask for in return is the Infernal gear!‚Äù Rodregas breathed deep trying to calm himself, but it was no use.
 ‚ÄúDOI‚ÄôVAN!‚Äù Rodregas yelled.
 Rodregas stepped out of his room which, unlike a normal room in a human house opened directly outside.

He grabbed my arm.
 I stood there and stared at him.
 ‚ÄúPlease Jazell, let me tell them myself,‚Äù he begged.
 I waited for him to let go, but his grip stayed firm and strong.
 I stared at him.
 ‚ÄúFine but I'm tired of waiting, Seth.‚Äù ‚ÄúI know, I promise I'll tell them,‚Äù He stood up, his grip still tight.
 ‚ÄúI just don't think now is the right time.

 ‚ÄúAlright, I'll leave this to you.
 But I swear...‚Äù ‚ÄúI will, I promise you!‚Äù he interrupted me.

I can‚Äôt imagine what my punishment would have been, though it might have been worth it.
 He fell asleep quickly and I ran as fast as I could, my pulse pounding with excitement.
 I spent the entire day away from the castle.
 Without the drain of practice, I was thrilling with energy.
 I could feel the trees, the mountain.
 I hope Father never comes back!
 I am sure I will try again tomorrow and every day I can spare after that.
 ~ Rune was completely unaware of any foul play yesterday, so I had full confidence in the spell this morning.
 Not that I wouldn‚Äôt have attempted it again anyway, but at least I know I‚Äôm safer now.
 No worries when I‚Äôm out of the castle.

"If we wait, we probably won't go."
 Cliff was more sensible.
 He said my mom could be right.
 I didn't relent until after his mom lectured us in practically the same words.
 Whatever the meaning of Eric‚Äôs death, it might've been losing him that convinced me to give up on Karen Flagstad.
 Anymore, the whole idea of having a best friend spooked me.
 Better to keep my secret life to myself and guard my heart than to trust somebody I was almost sure to lose---because that was how life worked---and mourn over.
 But then, in that way life has of confusing every issue, Karen invited me to be her graduation partner, which meant only walking side-by-side in a procession.
 Still I invited her to the prom.
 She accepted.

His slight start as my head came to rest on his arm was disappointing but entirely predictable.
 He adjusted my blanket slightly so it was between us and then pulled me closer.
 He was perfectly happy to touch me as long as there wasn't any actual skin on skin contact.
 Every time I pushed for more he backed away or found somewhere else he had to be.
 "That must have been rough.
 There are a lot of strong personalities down there."
 Alec's chuckle wasn't really amused.
 "You could say that.
 At first it seemed like things changed up on a daily basis.
 Then Jasmin manifested her royal wolf form and things settled down a little."

 voluptuous.
 Haven't you noticed?"
 She had, but she'd assumed that those weren't decent women, that they were the type to have love affairs with their husbands' brothers.
 Some women in 1927 frequently showed cleavage, but not as much as she'd be showing in these bathing suits.
 And their legs weren't completely uncovered at the same time.
 Swallowing, she considered.
 If this was the norm, she could adjust.
 It wouldn't be easy, but she did want to go to the shore.
 Bravely she returned to the dressing room, took off her clothes and her binding, and put on the black bathing suit.

"I want to make love to you more than I want anything in the world."
 He watched her face grow red.
 "But I knew that you wouldn't want to."
 She held his hand in both of hers, playing with his fingers.
 "And-and it feels as good as--as good as kissing?"
 "Better.
 Much, much better."
 She grew warm imagining a pleasure greater than what he'd made her feel a few minutes ago.
 "I wish--"  She stopped, swallowing and closing her eyes.
 "You wish what?"

"After that, you can have a fork if you want."
 Marie had eaten in Chinese restaurants in 1927, so she managed with the chopsticks.
 The meal was enjoyable, but she couldn't keep her thoughts from wandering to Rick.
 His neck looked so warm and inviting.
 She wanted to bury her face in the crook of his neck and shoulder.
 Did he like being kissed on the neck as much as she did?
 Just the memory of his kisses made her heart race.
 They had coffee and dessert in the living room.
 "What a pretty sculpture," Marie said, admiring a small porcelain garden filled with flowers and a water wheel.
 "Clap your hands," Teri told her.

I guess they didn‚Äôt want the loser to play his trump card with a pistol!
 My brother and I hustled drinks for them for small tips.
 After we were told to go to bed, we would hide behind the counter that blocked the table where they played cards.
 We could stay there late into the night and hear details of these shady lives.
 They all had odd nicknames.
 One man was called ‚ÄúThe Painter‚Äù and I have no idea where the name came from but I did know that if they needed someone‚Äôs house ‚Äúpainted‚Äù that this man was going there to kill them.
 He was a hit man, plain and simple!
 Their conversations were graphic.

 This man was called the ‚ÄúUndertaker,‚Äù but I am not sure what he did.

 She took the handkerchief he'd just pulled from his pocket, wiping her face.

 If-if I were to keep this beautiful ring, the first thing I'd want to do would be to run to my mother and tell her all about it.

 _You‚Äôre an orc, aren‚Äôt you?_
 Harruq snarled and shook his head.
 He shouldn‚Äôt have spoken to him.
 Shouldn‚Äôt have let him ask questions.
 The last of his adrenaline faded as images of the child‚Äôs quivering lips and trembling hands haunted his vision.
 ‚ÄúHalf,‚Äù Harruq whispered as he wiped blood from his swords onto the grass.
 ‚ÄúOnly half.‚Äù
 The kill had been quick, just a single cut through the shoulder blade, the heart, and then the lung.
 No suffering, little pain.

 But Emily wasn‚Äôt here.
 I could take it out with a few arrows but it‚Äôs best to kill Thrashers before they realize you‚Äôre there.
 Instead I lowered my bow and slowly crept up to it, until I could see the hideous claws on its hands and the hatred in its eyes.
 Thrashers hate everything and sometimes I wonder how they tolerate each other.

"You're probably not in any more danger today than you were that first night.
 Jessica isn't any fonder of you now than she was then.
 I've been working with James every day since then, but he hasn't really come around yet, so he is still a bit of a problem.
 Luckily, with Alec and Isaac both firmly on your side, and Jasmin starting to develop a liking for you, there isn't a thing those two can really do about it.

 Dom's smile was incredibly winning.

 "You're different from the others then?

There was a feral part of Alec that didn't play well with others, that would kill or be killed in turn rather than have his will thwarted.
 A complex collage of emotions flooded through my system as I tried to process what that meant, and whether or not I needed to be scared.
 As suddenly as it'd changed before, Alec's fist relaxed, shrinking back into its normal size and shape like melting snow.
 "All right.
 You can come.
 I don't like it.
 Don't like knowing you're guaranteed not to survive my passing, but it's your choice."
 I was too busy being amazed by how quickly he'd stopped shaking, how rapidly his eyes had gone back to normal to really wonder whether or not it was all just an elaborate ruse designed to lull me into a false sense of security so he could trap me here.
 "Not that I'm complaining, mind you, but why the sudden change?"
 Alec gave me a lopsided smile of his own.

Her long hair waved around her shoulders, stray locks caught by the wind.
 She wore a white dress with bell sleeves and a low-cut neck.
 Her pendant hung there.
 It started to refract light, but there was only darkness around my vision of her.
 The wind picked up and her dark hair began to whip back and away from her face.
 She was smiling, glorious now, her arms outstretched.
 The pendant started to glow and the darkness cracked.
 The wind was howling.
 I could barely see.
 Or maybe something was covering my face.

 ‚ÄúThe Ekreissar will not aid you,‚Äù Dieredon said when the noise died.
 He shook his head, and a bit of sadness crossed his face.
 ‚ÄúWe have been forbidden.
 Ceredon insists this is a minor skirmish, nothing more.
 We are not the keepers of man.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúMinor skirmish?‚Äù Antonil shouted.
 ‚ÄúWhat about the necromancer traveling with them?
 You‚Äôre the one who said he was dangerous, that he might be‚Ä¶‚Äù
 Another communal roar, even closer.

We learned again how to raise an eight year old when Bryce turned eight.
 You get where I am going with this.
 I always found it ignorant when someone would advise me how to raise my child when they had no children at all or they had children younger than mine.
 The most absurd statements begin with the words ‚Äúmy children will never."
 I never offered advice to any parent, and I never welcomed a statement about raising my children that began with the words ‚Äúyou should.‚Äù I have always tried to be the best dad I could be, because it was up to me to make their upbringing different than mine.
 I coached their soccer, baseball and football teams for many seasons.
 I walked my boys to school, helped with their homework (as much as I could) and I tried to be an important part of their lives as well as a positive influence.
 As I continued to succeed in business, our lifestyle improved.
 Throughout their childhoods, we‚Äôve had a good life and a beautiful home, nice cars, good communities, and the best of schools.
 I encouraged their interests by making sure they had the equipment they needed to pursue them.

He was coming in carefully, shield up, sword in position.
 Rodregas made up his mind not to underestimate him despite being severely wounded.
 Rodregas struggled back up and spread his feet wide for balance and locked his legs straight to try to keep them from buckling under him.
 He felt cold and knew he was losing blood fast.
 Rodregas knew that this was probably it.
 They had gambled and lost, there were just too many of them.
 But he did not want to die without taking out the Immortal Guards first.
 If he killed the slavers and the guards, there was a good chance that the slaves could escape.
 If Rodregas and his group died without taking the slavers and guards out, then they would have died in vain.
 Rodregas hoped Imeralda would get away.

It presents a set of real opportunities that can be tapped, provided that we take best advantage of the present situation.
 The progress it heralds is no more inconceivable and remarkable than the chain of recent achievements seemed seven years ago ‚Äì yet those we have already come to take for granted and, underinsistent prodding by the media, to replace in our consciousness with ever new concerns.
 PROSPECTS FOR THE YEAR 2005
 According to the provisions of international treaty, the final batch of nuclear weapons has been destroyed, ushering in a world free of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
 Global military spending has fallen by nearly 50 per cent since 1994 to $400 billion per annum (in 1990 US dollars), half of which is now contributed to a global military force responsible for enforcing a total ban on war between nations.
 Not a single inter-state or civil war is raging due to the extension of the UN's mandate to prevent all forms of war and its vastly strengthened military capabilities.
 International drug trafficking has declined by more than 80 per cent since the signing of the UN declaration granting the UN special powers to eradicate the drugs trade.
 An accelerated schedule for dismantling trade barriers and the formation of regional economic unions, such as the Middle East Economic Area that incorporates Israel and the Arab states, and other initiatives to promote larger bilateral trade between countries and regions, have helped to more than double the growth rate in world trade.
 With the assistance of the UN's World Development Force, proposed in this report, food shortages have been eliminated from the last famine danger zones in Africa, and total food production on that continent has doubled within a decade.
 Poverty is its direct forms has been eradicated in China and India by strategies that have led to the creation of hundreds of millions of new jobs.

"I'll order Donovan to keep you here."
 "You can try.
 He may even do it, but I don't think so.
 He's far too much the gentleman to keep a lady captive against her will.
 Even if he does, do you really think he can watch over me every second?"
 With a sharp tearing sound, Alec's right hand elongated into the viciously clawed weapon of his hybrid form.
 It shredded the comforter and mattress just a few inches from my head.
 I gave him my best lop-sided smile and kissed his arm.
 "You're not going to scare me off with cheap tricks.
 This is important."

 In a way, we are still in that first fuck, that first joining.

 But, in a very profound way, I am still inside her.
 My dick, my soul.

At home, I would've gotten drafted except I returned to school.
 Congress had extended the Social Security benefit for those of us with dead fathers.
 I would get paid to go to college until age twenty-two, which delighted my mom, to whom education was everything.
 San Diego State University was surrounded by faith centers.
 Mormon, Catholic, Lutheran, and Jewish.
 Down the road a few blocks was a large Baptist church.
 Since my profession of faith, my only steps in God's direction were reading through the Bible, praying now and then, and getting baffled by J.D.
 Salinger's Franny and Zoey, about a girl who goes around constantly muttering "Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on us."
 Her family decides she's crazy, and I agreed.
 Hoping to keep the light alive, I visited several churches that gave me the creeps, with clammy skin and something like nausea, the same feeling I have gotten from the sallow eyes of anorexics who obviously courted suicide, and from remembering nights I had to spend with my sinister grandmother, the Christian Scientist.

That‚Äôs when suddenly a hideous creature appeared in front of us.
 It was hunched over, with thick furry skin and wicked claws that shot out of its curled paws.
 We would soon know them as thrashers, beasts we would get used to seeing.
 I don‚Äôt know who screeched louder in fear, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it might have been me.
 Seth pulled his sword out but his hand shook like mad.
 I clumsily pulled an arrow out of the quiver on my back and struggled to attach it to my bow.
 How the heck did those people in movies make this look so easy?
 I exchanged a look with Seth, but he looked as clueless as I did.
 None of this felt real.
 I swear, the creature laughed at us.

 ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I whispered.
 ‚ÄúThanks June.‚Äù ‚ÄúGood luck, Jazell.‚Äù I opened the door and saw that Emily and Jason were also coming out of their rooms.
 Emily looked a little shaken but she gave me a thumbs-up.
 Good luck, June‚Äôs voice whispered one more time.
 Yeah, I was going to need it.
 Big time.
 Seth, I‚Äôm coming, I thought, and I meant it.
 Hold on.
 Then I walked out to face my destiny.

The day when it all changed was still a mystery to us.
 A lot of things happened that didn‚Äôt quite make sense.
 The four of us were already best friends.
 We were walking through the woods, rambling on about how Halloween was almost here and that Ms. Stecher was still giving us too much homework.
 Then all of a sudden an invisible object slammed into me.
 I shrieked and couldn‚Äôt move.
 It had me pinned to the ground.
 Seth ran forward and grabbed a branch to protect me.
 It should have gone right through the air but it collided into something and snapped in half.
 Seth dropped it in amazement.

Brushing the loose dirt off the papers I had buried, I laid the soiled documents across my lap and untied the laces binding them together.
 I stared at the words on the ancient parchment, unable to believe what I was reading was true.
 It had to be; it was signed with the official seal, staring back at me from the smudged white fabric of my skirt, the letters on the page as real and words as patent as they could be.
 The documents held the details of a trial, and not only a trial, a punishment.
 The punishment of Francine Katteryn Glaforia, found guilty of practicing dark magic.
 Her sentence included some sort of service to council and a spell binding her from using magic of any kind except practical.
 I was dumbfounded.
 It had never crossed my mind before, but as I considered it, searching for proof the documents were wrong, I realized Aunt Fannie had never used magic for anything but service.
 It hadn‚Äôt seemed unusual to me, it was just the way it had always been.
 And besides, I could barely do anything aside from lighting candles.

I've been with the others for almost two whole weeks, and nobody's hinted that there were hybrids with special powers."
 Mallory patted my hand again.
 "I probably wouldn't have complicated things this way save for the fact that for only the third time in my long life, I've looked inside a human, and seen something outside of the ordinary there."
 "Wait, you mean me?
 I've got a power?
 I'm about as ordinary as you can get."
 "Hardly ordinary.
 Have you had more of the dreams since Alec rescued you?"
 "How can they be a power?
 They're gorgeous, but nothing cool like what you described."

And, like, I know that a song is just a song‚Äîyet, I have to believe there is something there, an element, a catalytically charged element.

I gazed through the immense mass of leaves and branches overhead and breathed deeply.
 I felt the need to explain the welt, and my eyes rose toward him as I lightly touched my cheek.
 ‚ÄúI was searching for my mother‚Äôs things‚Ä¶‚Äù He didn‚Äôt respond, staring straight out into the meadow, so I returned to watching the canopy of leaves.
 ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt remember her,‚Äù I said.
 I hadn‚Äôt discussed this with anyone before, but once I started talking, I couldn‚Äôt seem to stop.
 Without his response, I kept on, explaining my dreams‚Äîpurposefully leaving out the part I had read about the northern clans‚Äîand closed my eyes in an attempt to see them clearer.
 I was recalling the details, her dark hair blowing in the wind, the feeling of being trapped, when my thoughts faded into the blackness of sleep.
 I woke in my own bed, the room lit by the dim light of a single flame suspended above my table.
 A flash of embarrassment hit as it dawned on me Chevelle must have placed me there; he must have seen my home, my room.
 And then I smiled, because he had left me a flame.

Cassie caught my eye before I looked down, but she was definitely glaring.
 Not the typical I-hate-you-and-I'm-going-to-do-everything-I-can-to-smear-your-reputation-and-get-you-in-trouble-because-we're-in-high-school-and-that's-all-I can-really-do type glaring.
 Instead her eyes seemed to warn me never to go out alone at night because if she ever found me somewhere without any witnesses, they were going to have to hospitalize me.
 I felt a chill run through me, and dropped my eyes out of involuntary reflex.
 I probably would've started shaking if someone hadn't grabbed my shoulder and startled some kind of twisted cross between a shriek and a gasp out of me.
 I turned to give whoever it was a piece of my mind, but Brandon's laughing gray eyes made the words tangle up before they made it down to my tongue.
 "Hey there.
 You still going to that tutoring lab after school?"
 I managed a nod that I thought nearly looked casual.
 "Good, I need to start tracking your movements so you don't keep running me over."

I struggled yet again but my body felt like lead‚Äîheavy, useless.
 Darkness enveloped me and I was underwater, struggling to reach the surface, desperate for air.
 ‚ÄúFrey.‚Äù A husky voice woke me.
 It must have been early dawn.
 The faint light revealed worry on Chevelle‚Äôs face as he stood over me.
 A look of fear and sympathy.
 The memory smashed into my chest like a thousand-pound ram, stealing my breath.
 ‚ÄúYou,‚Äù I hissed.
 He backed away as I sat up and glared at him with fire in my eyes.

Overvalued exchange rates encourage the import of low-priced farm products, depress local farm incomes, and make exports uncompetitive.
 Underdeveloped infrastructure results in high transport and marketing costs.
 The slow rate of technological development and diffusion have slowed growth in agricultural productivity.
 Irrigation potential is underdeveloped and poorly managed.
 A major international commitment is needed to reverse the trends and end the famine threat in Africa.
 The region possesses considerable potential that could be converted into higher rates of growth.
 Africa has the world's largest reserve of arable land, one billion hectares, of which only 20 per cent is presently cultivated.
 Fertilizer use in sub-Saharan Africa is very low relative to other developing countries.
 Per hectare consumption averages just 13 per cent of the level in India and 3.5 per cent of the level in China.
 Recent studies indicate that the area under irrigated crops could be expanded four to five times, primarily through small, private irrigation systems.

Once we stopped, I slid down Alec's back and looked around.
 The tiny cabin set back into the rocks before us blended into the hillside so well, I probably wouldn't have noticed it if Alec hadn't stopped so close.
 As soon as he was confident I could stand unaided, Alec gave me a reassuring smile, and then knocked gently on the door.
 The woman who appeared a few seconds later seemed frail in a way that somehow wasn't attributable to her graying hair, or slender frame.
 It wasn't until she released Alec from a hug, and slowly moved back into the cabin, that I realized it was how she moved that made her seem so old.
 Her motions reminded me of how my grandfather had moved the last few years before he'd died.
 Slowly, and with extra care, as if a careless action would leave him crumpled on the floor, racked with pain.
 "Mallory, I'd like to introduce you to Adriana Paige.
 Adriana, Mallory."
 I smiled, and gingerly offered my hand to her, which she clasped in both of hers.

Always going on and on about some crisis or another, but nothing ever really materialized."
 Alec's mom was tiny.
 It was easy to see where Rachel got her slight frame from, but there was more than just genetics at work.
 I'd never seen someone with so little extra flesh on their bones, at least not outside a hospital.
 It seemed she should be wearing a hospital gown instead of the white, flower-print summer dress I was almost sure cost more than my whole wardrobe.
 "We're experiencing a time of more than usual difficulty, Mother, but that isn't why I've come by.
 I wanted to present my friend Adriana to you.
 She'll be staying with us for the next few weeks."
 I got a distracted smile.
 "That's nice, dear.

Marie had been looking forward to going to the Cape, but listening to her mother talk about it, she wasn't so sure she was up to going.
 She needed the familiarity of home.
 She went up to her room soon after Tom left.
 She hadn't bought a stuffed animal for Rick's t-shirt, so she spread the shirt over a pillow.
 After she'd changed into a nightgown, she clutched his handkerchief in her fist and sat down in the rocking chair by her bed.
 She wished she'd gone to the library today--she'd like to have something to occupy her mind.
 She-- There was a tap at her door.
 "Marie?"
 "Come in."
 Her mother opened the door.

Normally that wouldn't have caused me to even pause in my normal routine, but it suddenly felt as if the stall was too small.
 "I told you to stay away from him, you stupid whore."
 I didn't recognize the voice for all that I felt like I should.
 It was a snarling alto that even distorted by anger had traces of smooth velvet, the kind of voice guys occasionally fantasized about, when they weren't thinking about other, less subtle, feminine features.
 Something hit the stall next to me, hard enough to leave dents.
 I was scared, I should have been terrified, but I was too busy trying to breathe.
 It was like the air had become thick, and although the fine strands of hair on the back of my neck hadn't moved, it felt like they should be standing on end.
 I heard indistinct sobbing, and then the voice returned and made me shiver.
 The sensation started somewhere on my back, and traveled forward like it was clawing to get out of my face.
 "I know you're sorry, just like you were sorry before.

But what did I want to happen?
 I had to catch that line of thought before it spiraled out of control; I concentrated on finding something small.
 A tiny pebble lay on the ground at my feet.
 I focused on it hard, willing it to rise.
 When nothing happened I looked for Chevelle‚Äôs reaction.
 He watched me, his serene mask back in place.
 ‚ÄúDo you need motivation?‚Äù I was afraid of the kind of motivation he‚Äôd provide, remembering the fireballs flying at me in the meadow.
 ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù My answer was too quick, and he laughed.
 I knelt closer to the gray rock.
 I thought it moved a little, as if trembling in fright, and the notion had me shaking my head.

Harruq nodded, shivering as he felt the tip of the blade rubbing against the tender skin of his throat.
 ‚ÄúGood.
 Pleasant days, half-orc.
 May Celestia watch over you‚Ä¶‚Äåand condemn your actions to death.‚Äù
 The biting tip left his throat, the blades in the bow retracted, and then the elf vanished.
 Harruq struggled to his feet, clutching his neck as he gasped for air.
 ‚ÄúDamn elf,‚Äù he cursed.
 ‚ÄúHow dare you threaten us.‚Äù
 His hands shook violently as his adrenaline faded.
 He had been terrified, convinced the elf would kill him, yet he didn‚Äôt.

I used to lie on the couch in the dark and listen to FM 100 on that thing‚Äîmy parents, well, if they thought about what I was doing at all, probably thought it was better than TV.
 Better than My Mother the Car, or whatever.
 I mean (laughs), c‚Äômon, look at all the space that fucker took up and all it did was play the radio or your LPs.
 Funny, looking back on it.
 I only remember my mother playing Englebert Humperdink.
 I still love ‚ÄúPlease Release Me,‚Äù man, that song makes me cry.
 And those old big band records.
 Shit, I like that old stuff, Glenn Miller, the Dorseys.
 Later, I got into FM 100, when it was a force, when it played stuff that inspired.
 They played us, I think the first place to play us.

What could it hurt, really?
 Sure, I could marry him, but it wouldn‚Äôt be real, I knew that.
 But the other part, well, I could do that without the marriage, couldn‚Äôt I?
 Harmless fun‚Ä¶ I smiled as I leaned closer to him.
 This was the first time I had initiated a kiss and he was grateful‚Äîmore than grateful‚Ä¶ overwhelmed with pleasure.
 I laughed to myself at what was to come, if this small, insignificant gesture brought him so much happiness.
 Our lips touched and he gasped, and then the breath turned to a low moan.
 I rubbed the back of my hand over a cheek, trying to clear away the blush of color.
 The encounter was very‚Ä¶ descriptive.
 I threw a wary glance over my shoulder, making sure Ruby was still at the window as I continued.

"This is all still very much against my better judgment, but I'm finding it increasingly hard to refuse you the things you want the most."
 "Somehow I find that hard to believe.
 Even if it were true, you're hardly the type to give away the upper hand by coming out and telling me so."
 Alec's eyes had taken on the serious, resigned expression that'd become disturbingly commonplace lately.
 "I know.
 I think that last part bothers me the most, but I find myself doing so nevertheless.
 Make sure you wait at least half an hour.
 There's a definite element of danger to all of this."
 ** I must have checked the clock sixteen times during the last five minutes of the obligatory half-hour.
 The sensible, grownup part of me was arguing for another five minutes just to make sure, but I told that part to take a flying leap and all but ran through the house looking for Donovan.

It‚Äôs a challenge.
 Some times you win, some times you get chased off by an angry mob wielding torches in the night.

 Johnny ‚Äì No, the ‚Äòimprovising‚Äô you claim you do.
 How is acting like a retarded lunatic  in front of a crowd fun?
 Jim ‚Äì It‚Äôs only fun if you do it well, and then because of the rush you get when you pull it off.
 Usually at the very least you get a laugh.

This increase has been accompanied by a growing shortage of labour, equivalent to 1 per cent of the workforce in 1991.
 Investment in education and training helped Thailand raise labour productivity by 63 per cent during 1980‚Äì5.
 It, too, is moving from a labour surplus to a labour shortage economy.
 An enormous range and depth of physical, technical, organizational, managerial and social skills are needed in order to utilize constructively the freedom which democracy provides, the productive power of new technologies, and the efficiency of modern institutions and systems to achieve greater developmental results.
 These skills admit of constant and continuous improvement without limit, in the same way that technology and organization can always be further improved.
 A comparative survey of the level and quality of skills in any country with those of countries above and below it on scales of economic and human development will reveal the crucial role of skills in development.
 A scale of progression on key skills can help every country identify its relative position, assess the scope for further progress and evolve strategies to fill the gap.
 Raising the skills of society to those of countries higher up on the scale will enable the country to move to that higher level.
 Despite enormous expansion of educational and training institutions, most developing countries suffer from a shortage of quality vocational skills among the huge number of people at lower levels of the society who seek desperately to raise their standard of living.
 This shortage retards the growth in productivity and quality needed to meet domestic needs and achieve international competitiveness.

Now, the discussion is over.‚Äù growled Marshal Faurrenida.
 To forestall any further argument, the Grand Marshal stepped forward quickly and drew his sword.
 The sword gleamed of the highest quality blue steel and red fire seemed to run its length.
 Marshal Faurrenida laid the sword on Rodregas‚Äô right shoulder and said, ‚ÄúSquire, you come to us this day.
 Think well and be sure on your decision to swear these oaths.‚Äù Faurrenida paused for a second and then slowly added.
 ‚ÄúWill you swear to uphold the Rules of Chivalry, to serve the Order of the Soaring Heavens with honor, and to serve as the Champion of the Celestials on this World if called to be a Paladin?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy Lord Grand Marshal, I so swear in the name of the Celestial Gods.‚Äù Strangely, instead of being excited, he felt tired.
 In some ways he was adding another burden and it was heavy.
 ‚ÄúArise, Sir Rodregas, Knight of the Soaring Heavens and be made welcome in the Cathedral of the Heavens.‚Äù Applause filled the room, though it was muted.
 Rodregas looked for Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda and he was sad to see that they had not been there to share his moment.
 Van‚Äôdret at least had left.

She wasn't on the bus, and she apparently hadn't come with her brother, so she wasn't coming.
 I knew I should reserve judgment until I'd given her a chance to explain what'd happened, but it was hard to remember that when faced with Alec's air of superiority.
 Rachel was nicer, but she was still a Graves.
 Maybe this was just a sign of things to come.
 Apparently I wasn't the only one put off by Alec's snobbishness.
 A couple of guys who looked like they were old enough to be in college were rolling their eyes at him.
 They were whispering and laughing, but positioned as they were closer to Alec than to me, I couldn't make out any of what they were saying.
 While I agreed completely with their sentiment, they were so loud they were disturbing at least twenty or thirty people.
 Hopefully they'd quiet down once the actual show started up.
 Judging by the orchestra, it was almost time.

‚ÄúI know their names and little else.
 Karak is death, Ashhur is life, and Celestia everything else, if the ramblings of priests and elves is to be believed.‚Äù
 Velixar nodded, the fire in his eyes growing.
 ‚ÄúThis world is young, Qurrah, and Karak and Ashhur are young gods.
 Only five-hundred years ago they came and gave life to man.‚Äù Those eyes twinkled.
 ‚ÄúI was one of the first they made.‚Äù
 The half-orc pulled his ragged robe tighter about him as he stared into the fire.
 ‚ÄúHow is that possible?‚Äù he asked.
 A soft wind blew, making the fire dance, and in the flickering flames Velixar smiled.
 ‚ÄúI was the favorite of Karak, my dear orcish friend.

I'd heard of teachers taking an instant dislike to one of their students, but I'd never experienced it first hand until now.
 I fielded two questions on the role of phosphorus in photosynthesis before being hit with a third one I couldn't answer.
 I felt my ears go hot as the three other girls in the classroom giggled.
 I slunk out of class as soon as the bell rang.
 English went better.
 Mr. Whethers got the class involved in a discussion of Heathcliff's motivations, which kept everyone occupied for the full class time, and distracted me from what was likely to happen when Britney and I got to algebra.
 As we walked back to our lockers between classes, I noticed that the halls seemed strangely empty.
 Britney rolled her eyes when I asked why.
 "Of course nobody's here.
 Tonight's the full moon, and there was a monster party last night.

People my age don't really do sympathy very well.
 We're much more inclined towards ridicule and hasty, usually unfair, judgments.
 Still, something had changed.
 I held onto that hope right up until I saw Mrs. Sorenson joining everyone else in staring at me whenever I looked down at my book.
 There was no mistaking the look on her face; it was utter distaste, possibly with a dash of disdain.
 I was so tired of it all.
 By the time English rolled around my natural embarrassment had given way to actual anger at Britney for starting it all.
 She tried to catch me at our lockers in between classes, but I pretended not to hear her, and made it safely into Mr. Whethers' class before she could catch up.
 Part of me acknowledged how petty it was, but I avoided her attempts at a whispered conversation during class.
 Mr. Whethers unknowingly helped my cause, when he crossly silenced a couple of girls on the far side of the classroom.

Brandon's gray eyes twinkled as he made a show of checking me over.
 "Looks like you're not sick."
 I didn't know it was possible to blush and smile at the same time.
 "Nope, not sick."
 After such a beginning, my day could hardly be anything but great.
 One class after another rolled by, and all of the things that normally would've bothered me just went whipping past without managing to stick.
 I couldn't remember the second phase of cell division in Biology.
 I'd forgotten to reread the last chapter of Wuthering Heights, and Britney went out of her way to snub me.
 The only thing I cared about was making it to lunch so I could see Brandon again.
 I dawdled on my way to Algebra, so much so I was nearly late for class.

‚ÄúEmily, knock it off balance.‚Äù ‚ÄúCan I skip while I do it?‚Äù Emily asked.
 He gritted his teeth.
 ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù He turned to me.
 ‚ÄúJazell, you‚Äôll aim for the belly while we hold it off.
 If you can‚Äôt get an arrow in before I can cut off the stinger, then I‚Äôll have to do it myself.‚Äù ‚ÄúFine boss dude,‚Äù I said with a snort.
 Seth ducked and charged the creature, his sword held out behind him.
 Jason flicked some knives into his wrist and flung them at the creature.
 Some hit their mark, which was signaled by the creature roaring out in pain, others fell into the dirt.
 Emily danced close to it, spinning fire from her fingertips.
 The creature raised a leg and swatted at her but she just twirled away.

 Dieredon kissed her forehead.
 ‚ÄúPut it behind you so you may focus on the task at hand.
 If the half-orcs are guilty, they will make a mistake soon enough.
 Your eyes and ears are vital in confirming their guilt.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try to keep him talking,‚Äù Aurelia said.

‚ÄúTell me more.‚Äù It was all I could do to pay attention to his words, but I was fascinated by their sound.
 ‚ÄúHer father was a dark elf.
 When her mother died during childbirth, he left her here in the village.
 I suppose it was for the best, really, since she can‚Äôt fly.
 The fairies would have tormented her.
 She‚Äôs still a bit of an outcast though.‚Äù He was still talking as I struggled to catch up in my head.
 I interrupted him, unable to stop myself.
 ‚ÄúMy mother died.‚Äù I had no idea why I was speaking.
 I batted my eyes and tried to shake it off, concentrating on Steed again.
 He seemed to notice I was back and continued his story.

‚ÄúAnd no, I have no plans of breaking my ribs again.‚Äù
 The horse made an interesting little noise, one Dieredon had long ago learned was laughter.
 He smacked her rump, earning himself an angry neigh.
 ‚ÄúFly on.
 You don‚Äôt want to miss the fun, do you?‚Äù
 A snort was his answer, but the creature did fly faster toward the rest of its kin.

I didn‚Äôt mean to interrupt.‚Äù She seemed pleased she had.
 Chevelle‚Äôs hand dropped and I could see out of the corner of my eye his face was hard.
 Ruby continued, ‚ÄúSteed said you had a guest so I just used the back‚Ä¶‚Äù She trailed off when his stare didn‚Äôt soften, but she smiled.
 ‚ÄúYou know, you do have your own room.‚Äù He stiffened and stood, not at all amused by her implication.
 Ruby began gathering things as she spoke, pretending she hadn‚Äôt noticed his attitude.
 ‚ÄúSo how did it go?‚Äù He relaxed a little but his mood didn‚Äôt rise in the least.
 ‚ÄúWe shall see.‚Äù ‚ÄúIndeed,‚Äù she purred.
 ‚ÄúIndeed.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt look back at me as he left the room, simply directing Ruby to take me with her when she‚Äôd finished.
 She seemed more than happy to comply and I was in no doubt we would be training again.
 I slid the hawk sculpture into my pocket.

Humans weren‚Äôt real.
 What kind of book was this?
 She had mentioned fairies‚Äô stories.
 I wondered if this was fiction, a fairy ruse, given to Chevelle by Ruby.
 Or maybe the dust was still playing havoc on me.
 I glanced over my shoulder at Ruby where she watched anxiously out the front window.
 I shook my head, finding the line again‚Ä¶
 But I couldn‚Äôt deny it.
 Their size was about that of an elf, but all were different.
 The men were thicker.

He got up and sat at the base of the tree.
 ‚ÄúYou had to take the good tree?‚Äù She motioned around.
 ‚ÄúThere are plenty of trees to pick from Jason.
 So pick one.‚Äù He mumbled something and closed his eyes.
 Emily shook her head.
 He was too stubborn sometimes.
 Emily stared at the sky and then she knew what he had said.
 She looked down to say something but Jason was fast asleep.
 He had said he wasn't going to leave her alone.

He was in the local jail and had been calling friends to bail him out.
 Our son hadn‚Äôt called us for bail; I had told him that he shouldn‚Äôt bother me when he got busted, one thing I had said that had apparently sunk in to his thick head.
 He was alive‚Äîa relief‚Äîbut we had no idea how much trouble he was in.
 The thoughts of trial and incarceration were unthinkable, but they were likely.
 The memory of accompanying my mother half way across the country to visit my brother in jail came back strong.
 I called the jail and received minimal information beyond his bail amount.
 We opted to leave Brandon in jail.
 He was released 23 hours later on his own recognizance.
 Brandon spent the days after his release from jail back at our home as we attempted the daunting task of detoxing him.
 Through withdrawals again!

Well then, I suppose I've no choice."
 Most people say they don't have a choice rather flippantly, but he seemed rather more like he had his back against the wall than I expected.
 "You know, I presume, that there was some confusion regarding the tourism project she bid out for the city?
 Well, I've managed to get to the bottom of the situation and it appears we did indeed award the contract to her."
 The news seemed too good to be true.
 "You mean she's got the job?"
 "Technically it isn't an employment offer.
 It's more in the way of a consulting project, but yes, she'll be in a sense working for the city.
 I've asked my staff to make sure that the confusion is cleared up with the bank as well so you shouldn't be in any kind of danger of losing your house anymore."
 I almost clapped for joy, only there was something off about it all.

They stood across from each other and readied themselves.
 Both tensed but neither took the low, wide stance previously used.
 As their eyes fixed on one another, I felt myself, and Ruby beside me, lean forward in anticipation of action.
 Both men went taut, their muscles corded, jaws clenched tight, determined stares focusing only on each other.
 I saw nothing happen but knew there must be something, some unseen force causing them pain, draining them.
 I couldn‚Äôt look away but stammered to Ruby, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey are trying to overpower one another.‚Äù I could hear the pleasure in her voice.
 ‚ÄúNo silly games, just power.‚Äù The way she said it had some part of my mind wondering whether her statement about not having her mother‚Äôs ambition was true.
 But I could only concentrate on the struggle in front of me.
 No visible action.
 I tried to judge by appearance who might be winning.

I know I took a risk extending Rune‚Äôs spell further, but I did not want to get caught, definitely not followed.
 I wondered if my sister was still at the original camp.
 Surely she wasn‚Äôt bright enough to figure it out.
 And apparently she wasn‚Äôt willing to tell anyone.
 I was returning to the spot I had found the humans the previous day when I ran across one of them alone.
 I hid myself behind a patch of brush to watch him.
 He had a lovely complexion with a hint of bronze and cropped dark brown hair with a few tiny streaks of blond just around his face.
 He looked less like the others I had been watching.
 He was built like the elves, strong and muscled, but still lean.
 He wore plain pants and tall boots.

Like I could write it out on a graph‚Äîthe Venn diagram of how to have a nervous breakdown.
 And the sixties were winding down like a colorful toy that was starting to show its cracks and whose motor was creaky with rust.
 Altamount followed.
 Manson.
 Things were getting grim.
 More and more people in the street but it didn‚Äôt look like those fuckers in Washington were gonna do a damn thing different‚Äîthe war, shit, look at it, it‚Äôs just deeper and deeper shit.
 And they were turning hoses on kids.
 Chicago happened, Abbie was arrested and tried.
 They tied a man to a chair‚Äîthis was 1968, man, not 1868.
 I was aghast, the whole country was aghast, I mean, those who cared.

Seeking to distract myself from a thoroughly useless train of thought, I looked around, trying vainly to pierce the curtain of black hanging around the feeble circle of light.
 "Are they out there waiting now?"
 Alec shook his head.
 "No, I'd already have come and carried you away if any of Brandon's people were around.
 Barring that, you'd hear us fighting.
 Mere doors and windows wouldn't do much to muffle the sound."
 "You'd be fighting, because of me."
 Alec slowly crossed the distance between us, and took my shoulders in his hands.
 "Please don't try and take the blame for this.
 We've been on a collision course with Brandon's pack for years."

A second dagger flew almost in the same heart beat from Doi‚Äôvan.
 The sorcerer simply waved in the air and both daggers flew to the side and clattered off the wall.
 The sorcerer smiled, standing tall, and Rodregas had to admit he seemed very relaxed and in control.
 His expensive black and gold robes were perfectly cut, his dark hair was slicked back.
 He might be wearing the body of a twenty year old, but he showed all the self confidence of a man who counted his age in decades if not centuries.
 Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs voice reflected the articulation and grace of a man who had all the time in the world to enjoy the finer things in life.
 ‚ÄúSo let us dispense with the silly games and lies.
 Let me be clear about something.
 You killed Nordien who was a friend of mine.
 You all die this day.

We roamed alleys and climbed hills no doubt mistaking mathematicians, who commuted daily to San Jose, for poets or novelists.
 Everybody who looked at home, we imagined had flopped in the Beat boarding houses Kerouac immortalized, or at least listened to the man speak his words in the Cellar, accompanied by a jazz riffing tenor sax.
 We overdosed on espresso.
 Then, as we climbed a hill to recover, I recited a jumble of lines I remembered from Ginsberg's Howl: "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix, wandered around and around at midnight in the railway yard wondering where to go, and loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking visionary Indian angels, and lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup, a hopeless task, and so took ship and disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving nothing behind but the shadow of dungarees and the larva and ash of poetry..." And I recited from On the Road about the children crying in Iowa where they let the children cry and where "the evening star must be drooping and spreading her sparkler dims on the prairie, which is just before the coming of complete night that blesses the earth, darkens the all rivers, cups the peaks and folds the final shore in."
 We explored every street and alley of North Beach and drifted into Chinatown, where I imagined us meeting two exquisite immigrant girls.
 I told Eric these beauties would plead for us to steal them away from the rich devil who had enslaved and brought them from China.
 We would conspire to snatch a suitcase full of cash from the rich devil.
 Then we would speed off toward the forests of Idaho to live in dissolute passion for a while.
 As always when my mind spilled over, Eric stood by me, often wearing a smile that hinted of love.
 Back in North Beach after midnight, a couple of Finochio‚Äôs transvestite dancers waylaid us.

Mrs. Alexander looked slightly startled, like she'd never thought of such an idea, or maybe just that she hadn't been expecting a question from anyone other than Sammy.
 "Not that I'm aware of.
 The water will actually emit quite a bit of ultraviolet light, but for whatever reasons, the electrons don't ever seem to release any electromagnetic radiation down in the lower energy levels like infrared, or even the visible red.
 You'd need red and all of the other colors to generate a true white light."
 It was obvious we were on the wrong track here.
 "What about some other mechanism?
 One that wouldn't just make water glow with a dancing gold light, but plants too.
 Do you know of anything like that?"
 I heard something snap off to my right, but I was too busy blushing from the chorus of giggles coming from the front of the classroom.
 Even Mrs. Alexander had an amused smile on her kind face.

‚ÄúYou two are going to have to play along when we get there, though.‚Äù She glanced at the sky, which was still speckled with stars even though dawn fast approached.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll wait until morning.
 I could use a bit more sleep.‚Äù
 She walked away, cast a levitation spell upon herself, and then settled in for sleep hovering an inch above the grass.
 ‚ÄúOdd girl,‚Äù Qurrah whispered.
 Harruq forced a laugh.
 To Qurrah‚Äôs eyes, he looked exhausted, and the shrinking of his muscles was glaring.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I left you there at Woodhaven,‚Äù Harruq said.
 ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm sorry you were alone when Velixar died.

Those who were in the program longer were more likely to do so, thanking others (both students and staff) for helping them through their most difficult challenges.
 Some were very emotional and some were humorous, all were heartfelt and meaningful descriptions of their individual challenges to reach that next level.
 It was clear that everyone here, whether they were staff or student, had the ability to impact anyone they touched.
 When the moment arrived for this evening‚Äôs three graduates to speak, a young lady in her early twenties walked to the front of the room with her head down.
 When she looked up, she smiled nervously.
 She had no family present.
 She told everyone how her mother told her how ugly she was her whole life and told her she was worthless, how she attempted to numb the pain with the drugs she took.
 How she became addicted to the drugs, and prostituted herself to pay for her habit.
 She said that she took all the drugs she could because she knew she would never be alive to see her twenty-first birthday.
 She smiled and announced that she was now twenty-one.

Anyway, those little fuckers defy your best efforts, they‚Äôre almost always gonna be quicker than you.
 That‚Äôs what writing is, man, it just keeps going farther into the sand, the thing you‚Äôre looking for, the thing that‚Äôll make it all alright.

 CM:  	Uh‚Ä¶some people see in your ‚ÄúCalifornia‚Äù LPs a kind of return to innocence, a willful perspective that is more Edenic, or childlike.
 Would you say that you are seeking innocence with your recent work, that you are moving toward artlessness?
 BG:  	You would say that.

The small room also had glass ceilings but they were dimmer.
 The room was dark and cold, with dust in the air.
 ‚ÄúI was wondering when you would get here,‚Äù a familiar voice said.
 I jumped and looked into one of the corners.
 The girl from my dreams walked out, shimmering.
 She smiled and I then noticed the bow hanging on her back with a quiver of arrows.
 ‚ÄúYou know how you asked for my name before?
 I can tell you now,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúActually, I can tell you a lot.‚Äù ‚ÄúGreat, I‚Äôm all ears.‚Äù She laughed.
 ‚ÄúMy name is June and like you, I was once a full human.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a half-ling?‚Äù I asked in amazement.

 "Well, I guess I have to go face him."
 "Are you sure you want to end your betrothal, darling?"

1.Generate consensus for the transition programme: The transition should be an expression of the will of the society for change and it should help generate greater unity and harmony within the society.
 Further attempts to put through any macro-economic reform package will meet with strong political and social resistance unless a national consensus on the strategy is arrived at beforehand.
 Any programme involves a set of choices regarding which are the most accept able costs and important benefits.
 Before launching new initiatives, governments should conduct public inquiries and debate alternative packages of policies and practices.
 The inquiry should realistically access the expected costs and benefits of each package.
 After educating the public about the need for choice and the necessary costs involved, the final selection of the most accept able package should be made by the people themselves through a national referendum.
 2.Establish macro-economic stability: The errors in earlier efforts at adjustment and stabilization have led some to argue for a series of compromise programmes that do not seriously ad dress the imminent dangers of hyperinflation and economic collapse.
 No transition strategy can be successful without first creating stable conditions for economic growth.
 No effort to improve agricultural production or the availability of food will be successful so long as the currency is not accepted as a stable means of exchange.
 This is the ultimate justification for the insistence of the international lending community on harsh measures to stabilize the economy.

 Qurrah chuckled.

‚ÄúWhat's wrong with two crazy, half-ling kids going outside in the morning because they're both tired of listening to their other two friends bicker while they play hand games?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, you know it's weird that you two are talking alone, without letting the rest of us know what it is,‚Äù she shot back.
 ‚ÄúUnless you two are hiding something from us?‚Äù Nice save, Seth.
 ‚ÄúUm...‚Äù I said.
 ‚ÄúWhy would we hide anything from you two?‚Äù Emily put her hands on her hips.
 ‚ÄúI don't know, but you two are acting like you are hiding something.‚Äù She stopped and gave me a wicked smile.
 ‚ÄúUnless you two were not talking-‚Äù ‚ÄúGod no, Emily!‚Äù I interrupted her.
 ‚ÄúNo way, we were just trying to get away from you two because I just woke up and you guys are really loud first thing in the morning.‚Äù She sighed.
 ‚ÄúFine, don't bite my head off Jazell, I was just asking a question.‚Äù Then she turned and disappeared back in the cave.
 Seth let out a huge breath.
 ‚ÄúWow, I'm glad she left.

That he settled for being Livingston Taylor is the story‚Äôs twist, what gives it verisimilitude.
 Life is unpredictable, like a chemistry experiment.
 Like The River.
 Skippy and Crafty were not even angry with Buddy, to hear them tell it today.
 Skippy works at Ardent and Crafty is a driver for UPS, but they recall those grand days with Buddy with something like ardor.
 ‚ÄúHe was way ahead of all of us,‚Äù Skippy says.
 ‚ÄúHis energy came from someplace else.‚Äù At any rate in early 1970, having witnessed the death of some of the gods, Buddy Gardner turned his back on Memphis, moved to L.A. with Lorelei, who then just as suddenly disappeared.
 Like a genii whose work is done.
 Some say she turned to making porno films.
 Some say she works in television.

 I mean, it hurt her, yeah, she‚Äôs human.
 But, she knew I wouldn‚Äôt do anything like this lightly.
 She knew it must have been some kind of deep cut for me to persist in it for, what, a couple weeks, a little longer.

‚ÄúI was searching for my mother‚Äôs things‚Ä¶‚Äù He didn‚Äôt respond, staring straight out into the meadow, so I returned to watching the canopy of leaves.
 ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt remember her,‚Äù I said.
 I hadn‚Äôt discussed this with anyone before, but once I started talking, I couldn‚Äôt seem to stop.
 Without his response, I kept on, explaining my dreams‚Äîpurposefully leaving out the part I had read about the northern clans‚Äîand closed my eyes in an attempt to see them clearer.
 I was recalling the details, her dark hair blowing in the wind, the feeling of being trapped, when my thoughts faded into the blackness of sleep.
 I woke in my own bed, the room lit by the dim light of a single flame suspended above my table.
 A flash of embarrassment hit as it dawned on me Chevelle must have placed me there; he must have seen my home, my room.
 And then I smiled, because he had left me a flame.
 I stretched my entire body, rejuvenated from the rest.
 I was unsure how long I‚Äôd slept but it looked like the sun was rising again and I wanted to be out of the house before I ran into Fannie.

We sat at the table and Emily titled the page: Warnings.
 I didn‚Äôt know why.
 ‚ÄúOkay, Jazell, what exactly did he say?‚Äù Emily asked, pencil poised in the air ready to write.
 ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs rising, he‚Äôs rising‚Äô.

 ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòYou won‚Äôt stop him, little warrior.‚Äô‚Äù He frowned at the last part.

I couldn't place him.
 I slowly shook my head, trying to jar something loose enough to figure out who he was.
 "Please, Adriana.
 It really isn't any trouble.
 James, can you get your car, please?"
 He looked angry.
 Like maybe he was going to argue, but as he opened his mouth Rachel turned and glared at him.
 It seemed odd to see someone only a little smaller than Alec back away from someone even smaller than me.

A couple weeks after Eric's funeral, Cliff and I decided we should quit school and move to San Francisco.
 When school let out that day, we went up the street to La Mesa Junior High and found my mom grading papers on the patio behind her classroom.
 We told her our plans and listened while she recited all the reasons leaving now, three months short of graduation, was all wrong.
 She even tried to bribe us, offering to help with money if we would wait until June and apply to a San Francisco college.
 "Nope," I said.
 "If we wait, we probably won't go."
 Cliff was more sensible.
 He said my mom could be right.
 I didn't relent until after his mom lectured us in practically the same words.
 Whatever the meaning of Eric‚Äôs death, it might've been losing him that convinced me to give up on Karen Flagstad.

 That was depressing.
 Johnny ‚Äì How did he do that?
 Jim ‚Äì Well he‚Äôs not the brightest side-kick out there.
 Johnny ‚Äì Then why does would anyone keep him around?
 Jim ‚Äì A couple reasons, first he can fit into places that a five hundred pound sumo wrestler would never be able to go.

The UN Secretary General has rightly drawn attention to the worldwide crisis in development economics and called the need for new thinking on development ‚Äòthe most important intellectual challenge of the coming years‚Äô.
 Until now development has been largely a haphazard, subconscious or half-conscious process of trial and error experimentation, an application of partial strategies, a confusing mixture of productive and counter-productive initiatives, an unscientific and often superstitious clinging to half-truths or old-truths that no longer have any relevance.
 Development is not merely a set of goals or programmes.
 It is a social process by which human beings become mentally aware of new opportunities and challenges, conceive of ideas, create inventions, release their energy and enthusiasm for achievement, and acquire the skills and organizational capacities for action.
 A better understanding of that process will enable us to avoid the errors and tardiness of past efforts and accomplish in the next few decades what might otherwise take centuries.
 The world possesses sufficient experience and information to formulate a comprehensive and integrated theory of development as a social process.
 The theory should explain the process by which human society has developed to where it is today, the forces which propel its growth, and the stages of its past and future progress.
 It should be based on the perception that the political, economic and social life of human kind is a single, inseparable whole and, therefore, that comprehensive, total strategies must be applied to resolve our problems, because partial strategies lead to partial solutions which disturb the harmony of the whole, generating unwanted side-effects.
 This knowledge should be utilized to formulate a model of development that is based on the internal dynamics of the process rather than on its external manifestations or extrapolation of future trends from past data.
 This model should become so precise that we can anticipate the impact of peace, more education, greater political freedom, rising social expectations, and high values such as guaranteed employment on the progress of society.

The real pain was coming.
 A glance behind did little to raise his spirits.
 He saw at least thirty undead shambling as fast as they could in a widening arc.
 If he remained where he was, he would be seen.
 He struggled to his feet and ran.
 More minutes passed.
 The glow of Woodhaven drifted behind him.
 Breathing was agony.
 Moving was torment.
 All his extremities grew cold and his head felt light.

 Harruq stood, brushed some dirt from his pants, and then offered Qurrah a hand.
 Together they trudged west, without food, water, or blankets.
 The guards watched them go, smirking all the while.

 That night Harruq collected a bunch of sticks and twigs, which Qurrah lit with a clap of his hands.
 The two huddled over the fire, each lost in their thoughts.
 Harruq broke the silence first.

Whatever else he was, he wasn't the thoughtless jerk Brandon had proven himself to be.
 "I'm sorry, Adriana.
 I wish we could, for Rachel's sake as well as yours, but it's just too risky.
 Fewer witnesses means more chance Brandon's people will try to arrange for something to happen.
 There are just too many of them for us to meet them in a stand-up fight and come out unscathed."
 I didn't like it.
 Mrs. Campbell was the only teacher who'd taken an active interest in my wellbeing, but I could see his point.
 I managed to do at least a passable job hiding my near frown as I nodded in acceptance.
 "Can I have just a few minutes today after school to tell her?"
 Alec's hand was warm on my face as he nodded.

Rodregas felt his skin crawl and he almost left the chamber, but then the cat shape behind the daemon became clear.
 The Daemonic shape seemed to be missing the odd combinations of the others.
 It looked like the large Panthers he had heard of that were found in the southern jungles.
 It had no mane like the lions he knew and its fur was black.
 In fact it was the darkest black he had ever seen.
 This was why, at first, he had not seen the shape in the dark.
 It seemed to soak in and blend in with the night.
 Unlike the Celestial Lion that seemed to be caught in the action of stalking forward in the middle of the hunt, the Night Panther was sitting and seemed to have been caught in the act of simply watching the world.
 His eyes were normal golden cat eyes, not the glowing red of most of the other creatures.
 The only daemonic aspect to the shape was a pair of horns coming out the sides of his head, not that dissimilar to Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs curving up and back protecting the skull.

Caught up in the evening's enchantment, she gazed up into his eyes, hoping he'd kiss her again.
 But Davis stepped back and turned to draw her arm through his, grinding his teeth.
 He wanted to throw her to the ground and tear off her clothes, and every time he was alone with this beautiful ing√©nue, his self-control took a tremendous beating.
 All that made him maintain it was the knowledge that her father would kill him if he laid a finger on her before marriage.
 He glanced at his watch; he'd get Marie home by midnight and then spend a couple of hours at Mae's establishment.
 "Now it is a perfect evening."
 Marie smiled.
 "Every night in Hollywood must be like this."
 He laughed.
 "What makes you think that?"

"It's so beautiful.
 I don't know what to say.
 Are you sure you want to give it up?"
 Alec looked back up at me, and his eyes were filled with incredible need.
 I was suddenly struck by the similarities to the me he'd painted, and what I saw written on his face.
 It seemed impossible he would be unsure, that a glorious being like him could ever need anything I could provide, but I couldn't deny it was there.
 There was no way of knowing what it was, but I didn't care.
 Whatever it was he needed I wanted to give him.
 I opened my mouth to say as much, but my vocal chords wouldn't cooperate.
 I was still trying to verbalize my feelings, when his free hand came down to my chin and gently pulled it up.

And Lennon was going to play, they said, but Hoover, that bastard,  was keeping him out of the states, and, anyway there was all this legal maneuvering going on, and, somehow, it just never happened.

 We‚Äôd be talking about a different story right now.
 Hell, we‚Äôd probably still be together.
 So, we didn‚Äôt do that.
 And we didn‚Äôt do Wattstax, either.
 (laughs)  It‚Äôs funny now, but, at the time, it seemed to sound some kind of death knell to us.
 Or maybe just to me.
 I felt marginalized, like we were from this backwater town and everything was happening elsewhere, like you know, how everybody in Memphis feels about New York, or it was San Francisco for a while.

Britney looked particularly unhappy.
 Mrs. Campbell was looking at my homework when I reached her desk.
 "I was prepared to tear into you for not going to the tutoring lab last night, but that hardly seems fair seeing as how you went ahead and did the work by yourself."
 I felt a small glow of satisfaction flare into life, but her next words ensured it didn't get out of hand.
 "Of course, you've got the right answers, and technically you're attacking the problems correctly, but you're leaving out a couple of steps that I think will give you problems a bit later on.
 Please take my advice and spend a little bit of time at the math lab.
 Even if you can't make it every day, you need to come in a few times a week."
 "Yes, ma'am."
 The scolding actually hadn't been that bad, almost like disguised praise.
 Britney looked like she was hoping for something similar, but Mrs. Campbell's expression quickly dashed that idea.

 ‚ÄúI imagined myself in my body, and what is was like to be back.
 And then I was back to normal.
 Wait.‚Äù The wind picked up around him and then suddenly he was back, blue hair and all, standing beside his sitting, normal body.
 ‚ÄúWow how did you do that?‚Äù Emily gasped.
 ‚ÄúI imagined what it was like to fight that creature.

Common security against transnational threats and common prosperity for all humankind cannot be based on a 250-year-old concept of nation sovereignty.
 Over the last half century, national sovereignty has been maturing into international sovereignty.
 As the evolution of the international community proceeds towards the establishment of an effective system of world governance in one form or another, the collective rights of the international community of nations must inevitably come to be regarded as another inalienable truth, alongside individual human rights and the rights of each nation.
 The right of the nation state to self-determination has to accommodate the rights of other nations and the common shared rights of every human being.
 This approach establishes criteria for determining when claims of national sovereignty must be ignored.
 Every right is accompanied by a responsibility.
 A government that fosters external aggression or cannot contain domestic violence and civil strife, that cannot create conditions in which its people can feed themselves or even receive outside assistance, fails the test of sovereignty.
 Under these circumstances, the international community, through the UN, should have the right and accept the responsi bility to intervene appropriately.
 The need of the hour is not to undermine the legitimate right of nations to self-determination, but rather to protect that right by more clearly demarcating its legitimate boundaries against the highly visible challenges being posed by forces of disintegration and fragmentation from within.
 The current tendency for states to fragment along ethnic lines cannot be handled by any abstract principle of international law.

The first store we stopped at didn't take us seriously until Rachel pulled out a black American Express, after which every sales person in the entire place lined up to assist us.
 Once we each sported a bag or two from some ridiculously over-priced store, things went much more smoothly.
 I tried on a variety of jeans, blouses, shirts, skirts, dresses, and just about every other article of clothing imaginable.
 I drew the line at a swimsuit, since there was no way on earth I'd ever wear one, and then felt so bad at how crushed Rachel was that I let her drag me into a store full of formals.
 It was a mistake because I soon found myself being zipped into a delicate, green dress that I was absolutely positive wasn't going to survive the experience of trying to wrap itself around me.
 "Oh, it's perfect, Adri.
 We have to get it."
 I avoided looking at the mirror.
 It seemed like a crime to defile such a pretty dress, and I wanted to remember it like it had looked on the hanger, all shimmery and wispy.
 I did risk a look down at the price tag.

"Okay, I might be a little tired, but it isn't a big deal.
 I want to spend as much time with you as possible.
 After all, it isn't like I'm going to be able to really get much rest between now and whenever we need to leave for the challenge."
 His wonderfully expressive face froze into the stony mask he wore so often with the rest of the world.
 "You weren't planning on bringing me, were you?"
 "It's not safe, Adri.
 I don't want to leave you anymore than you want to be left, but it's the only option."
 "No, it isn't, just bring me along."
 His fist clenched, knotting up the covers next to my head, but I was long past worrying he'd lose control of his beast and hurt me by accident.

Too much reliance has been placed on the capacity of the teacher to teach, too little on the inherent natural capacity of human beings for self-motivated learning and self-discovery.
 It may be fair to say that the state of our educational systems throughout the world is an accurate reflection of the state of human development in different societies.
 In this context, the UN Millennium Goals of achieving universal primary education and eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary education represent the bare minimum commitment that every society must make to enhance the capacities of its youth.
 The great Tamil poet, Subramanya Bharati, rightly emphasized that nutrition and education are the two legs of a human being.
 Pre-school education should receive as much attention as post-graduate education.
 At the other end of the development spectrum, no society has yet developed the knowledge and expertise to impart the best of what it has acquired to a broad cross-section of its citizens.
 Few have been able to ignite the aspiration for continuous learning and the capacity for original creativity that are the most profound characteristics of human consciousness.
 Measured in these terms, even the most developed nations still have a long way to go and much that can be done to further the development of their people.
 To sum up, 10 years ago when we presented the report of the International Commission on Peace and Food, we were optimistic that humankind will grasp the uncommon opportunities provided by democratic systems of governance and technological and knowledge revolutions for achieving a world without hunger and where every individual has an opportunity for a productive and healthy life.
 The onward march of technology is still in full swing, but the political commitment to foster cooperative human security worldwide is yet to emerge.

 I wasn‚Äôt sure how long they‚Äôd be gone; I went to one of the narrow windows on the front wall and peered cautiously out.
 They were nowhere to be seen, but the sights of the village distracted me quickly enough.
 It was so unlike home.
 Night gave the gray stones an even darker appearance, the firelight glinting off their ragged edges like polished onyx.
 Torches lit each walkway and building.
 It seemed late, but several villagers were still outside, loud and boisterous.
 Nearly everyone dressed in black, a few of the men bearing large silver breastplates or wrist cuffs.

Even in my befuddled state it was obvious she was lying.
 "I don't know, but you can use this.
 You're not being mocked or scorned anymore.
 True or not, that rumor is the most romantic thing anyone here has ever heard.
 It will transform you into a mini-celebrity overnight."
 The haze was starting to evaporate from my thoughts, the story still didn't make sense, but Rachel's explanation did.
 "The story's vague enough that nobody can really prove or disprove it.
 Don't get specific on any details, and you can ride this all the way until you graduate."
 The mask was gone, she wasn't lying anymore.
 She really believed this rumor would change everything for the better.

And if I was lucky, it would be an easy take down.
 I closed my eyes and began my mental countdown.
 The wind picked up around me, as if a wind current had just appeared out of nowhere.
 5‚Ä¶ My body started to feel hot, like I was being hugged by the sun.
 I hated this part.
 4‚Ä¶ Power surged through me as I was freed from my human self.
 Shivers ran down my spine.
 3‚Ä¶ I felt cold, like being dipped in ice water.
 The breeze picked up even harder.

They banked around, still in perfect formation, and then dove again.
 ‚ÄúKill them now!‚Äù he ordered, his fingers crooking into strange shapes.
 ‚Äú _Hemorrhage!_ ‚Äù Qurrah hissed, pointing at the nearest horse.
 Blood ruptured from the beautiful creature‚Äôs neck.
 The rider steadied her best he could, knowing his doom approached.
 They crashed into the inky blackness, crushing bodies underneath before the swarming dead tore them to pieces.
 Velixar‚Äôs first attack was far more impressive.
 Bits of bone ripped out from his undead army; femurs, fingers, ribs, and teeth flew into the sky in a deadly assault.
 The elves broke formation as the barrage approached.
 The first ten, however, were too close to have hope.

The phone rang late that night with the unbelievable news of another car accident.
 This time Tom‚Äôs paralyzed body was thrown through the window and he tumbled down the highway to his death.
 Brandon was inconsolable.
 His best friend was dead.
 Brandon blamed himself for not being there to take care of Tom.
 One of Brandon‚Äôs confessions during rehab was that almost all of his friends decided to get as high as they could to attend Tom‚Äôs funeral.
 It was the beginning of his excessive drug abuse.
 Chapter 24: Let The Healing Begin As Brandon approached his fifth month as a student at Narconon, he called us and told us he was nearing graduation from the program.
 He also told us he had applied for an internship at the facility and that he wanted to become a drug counselor.
 Brandon told us he wanted to give back and stay on to help others and told us how much better equipped he felt to deal with the world which surrounds us all, but silently haunts a select few.

Doi‚Äôvan was of course referring to the healing sigil.
 He wisely did not say it out loud as every squire there would have been asking about where they had gotten one.
 Rodregas started to get up, but quickly decided it was smarter to stay lying down for now.
 ‚ÄúWhere did we finish?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúActually we did pretty good.
 There were more than a few that cannot go on, even if you had won.
 You finished eighth overall in the tournament, with a second place white ribbon for the joust.
 Several of those who would now be higher are too injured to continue.
 So you are now in fourth place overall.
 Geriodon and Nordien were the top two finishers,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan.

We were so proud of our mother and we loved to tell our friends where she worked.
 Our friends would openly wonder why a mother would be working at all.
 It was very unusual in that time period not to have a father.
 Our friends were puzzled by our missing parent, our working mother, and our home with our grandparents.
 We were an oddity in the sixties to almost everyone we met.
 Other parents would question us when we visited our friend‚Äôs homes, extracting information that we were ignorant enough to share and which likely hit the gossip circuit immediately.
 The other mothers were threatened by our mother, as she was beautiful and divorced!
 I would later realize how poorly my mother was treated by other mothers, and how she endured many unwanted sexual advances and groping by their spouses and her employers.
 It was the sixties, and my mother was damaged goods in their eyes; she was vulnerable.
 We eventually moved out of my grandparents‚Äô home to an apartment in Los Angeles and then to a small rental house in Burbank that backed up to a military plant.

Indigenous technological capacities can be strengthened to develop location-specific technologies, rather than relying on direct material transfer of crop varieties unsuited to local conditions.
 Greater emphasis on the training of local manpower can significantly improve the effectiveness of agricultural extension systems and integrated rural development projects.
 Special Status of Agriculture
 The obvious limitations of government-directed agricultural development, coupled with the resurgent popularity of free-market policies following the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the successful completion of the GATT negotiations, raise fundamental issues about the status of agriculture and the role of government in this sector.
 Advocates of private enterprise contrast the failures of Eastern European agriculture with the achievements of the industrial nations as ample evidence of the free market‚Äôs superior capacity to achieve high levels of agricultural productivity.
 Recently, international and bilateral financial institutions have promoted the market as the most effective instrument for managing agriculture throughout the world.
 This view leaves two questions unanswered.
 First, if the market is so effective, why is it that every major capitalist economy utilizes such a vast array of subsidies, incentives, controls, production quotas and fixed pricing mechanisms to govern production and trade in agricultural products?
 Even after GATT, protection for this sector by industrial nations will remain high.
 Second, granted that the market works effectively for mature capitalist societies with high levels of technology, education, productivity, living standards and food surpluses, and relatively small portions of the workforce dependent on agriculture, is the same necessarily true for countries at an earlier stage of development, in which (1) a majority of the workforce is dependent on agriculture for sustenance, (2) levels of education, productivity and incomes are low, and (3) any increase in food prices can have a devastating impact on food consumption levels in the country?

 There was Junnie, her blonde hair shining in the sun as she greeted me at her door on the west side of the village.
 And Junnie, mysterious under a hooded cloak, fighting with magic and weaponry, killing members of the council guard.
 We sat around a fire, telling stories.
 Someone was ribbing Ruby.
 Her eyes narrowed when she replied to him, matter-of-factly, ‚ÄúYour mouth is very small.
 It‚Äôs unattractive.‚Äù And her head bobbed side to side as she smiled, pleased with herself.
 Anvil laughed and his tongue wagged.

Certain police or crime television shows would give us lumps in our throats as we would silently look at each other and know we were thinking the same thing‚Ä¶ that might be our son.
 One afternoon while I was at work, Lisa was trying to help Brandon out by organizing some of his bills.
 Brandon told her that he needed to run a quick errand.
 She called me later that day and said she had lost track of him and he wasn‚Äôt returning her calls or answering his phone.
 All the usual horrible thoughts began to surface in our minds.
 The day turned into night and we still hadn‚Äôt heard from him.
 Close to midnight, as Lisa and I watched a movie together in the dark, there was a loud banging at our back sliding glass door.
 Our dogs went crazy‚Äîthey were as startled as we were.
 Who the fuck was at our back door?
 It was Brandon‚Äôs druggie friend, high as a kite, rambling a mile a minute.

If discovered, he would die fighting.
 The footsteps neared.
 A clacking sound haunted his hearing.
 It rattled sporadically, and it was most certainly bone hitting bone.
 He imagined a loose jaw hanging by only one side, or perhaps a hand held by a thread of flesh banging against a rotted femur.
 It took all his will not to scream when a great weight pressed against his shoulder.
 The pain that exploded throughout his body was so great he blacked out as he lay there in the grass, a horde of undead searching for his wounded form.

I shouldn't have left you here like that."
 Britney's voice was coated with sincerity, but it was the thinnest of layers, one which poorly disguised all kinds of nasty little feelings.
 On the other hand, it distracted my mind from the string of thoughts I'd otherwise have followed all the way down to a full-blown panic attack.
 It was a small thing in the grand scheme of the universe, but it was just enough to tilt the balance in her favor.
 I still didn't like her any more than she really liked me, but I was willing to tolerate her.
 To pretend we were friends so that neither of us had to face the scary world entirely on our own.
 "Okay, apology accepted.
 It wasn't very nice, but I suppose everyone makes mistakes."
 Britney's eyes grew bright, even after such a short acquaintance, I knew she was about to launch into a blow-by-blow account of the last twelve or so hours.
 "Listen, I don't mean to be rude, but I've got to finish up my physics homework.

 I turned to him, glaring, and he drew back, startled.
 ‚ÄúIs that what you want, why you are so intent on marrying me?
 For my power?‚Äù He shook his head, mystified.
 The rage had overtaken me, though.
 The weeks of drugging Rune, sneaking out, my missing father‚Äîsearching for a new wife, I was sure‚Äîall of it too much.
 I slipped.
 A small crack in my stability let out enough magic to hurt him.
 I didn‚Äôt hit him, but the surrounding trees and rocks were pulverized and I knew I had done too much.
 He stared back at me‚Ä¶ afraid.

Not because of the lightheadedness, though I was feeling faint, but because below me, before the steps to what I now realized was a castle, a thousand elves watched me.
 I sucked in a harsh breath, unable to get my mind to accept what I knew was happening.
 I had been so oblivious.
 Reading the diary, learning of my mother and her ties to the throne.
 It had told of my own life, of what I was to become, a reality that would not be put to rights in my broken mind.
 But as I stared down, the assembled pieces of my shattered self held together by no more than tattered bits of string, I understood.
 This was my place.
 I heard Ruby behind me now.
 In a low voice she said, ‚ÄúThey have heard of your return.
 They have come to see for themselves.‚Äù Their rulers had burned, along with so many of their families.

 But she didn't recognize the interior at all.
 It contained all kinds of shops with jewelry, candy, and a variety of other goods that she didn't have a chance to inspect because when Rick realized that there weren't any major clothing stores here, he led her back to the car, and they drove to a huge indoor shopping area he called a mall.
 "Why don't we just buy you something comfortable for now?‚Äù he suggested as they went into the nearest store.
 ‚ÄúSomething to wear around the house."
 He led her to the ladies‚Äô section.
 "What size pants should we try?"
 "I have no idea."
 He took a pair of soft jeans and held them up.

 Harruq halted before the mess that had been his prey.
 The line of undead stood motionless, their unfocused eyes looking nowhere.
 The wind blew through them, shifting their hair and whistling through the holes in their bodies.
 The half- orc said nothing, just stared at the carnage and the servants of his master as he waited for Qurrah.
 The mindless rage that had consumed him slowly faded.
 By the time his brother arrived, it was all but a memory.
 ‚ÄúThe undead took them,‚Äù Qurrah said, his breath quick and shallow.

Rick‚Äôs heart broke for her.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, sweetheart,‚Äù he murmured, stroking her hair.
 As her sobs began to subside, he tightened his arms around her and pressed his lips to her ear to whisper, ‚ÄúMaybe you came to 2011 because there‚Äôs someone here to help you and care about you.‚Äù She pulled back a little and managed a small smile for him.
 ‚ÄúAt least that‚Äôs an explanation I can live with.‚Äù  She took the handkerchief he offered her.
 He kissed her temple.
 ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we put all this stuff up and have it tomorrow?
 I‚Äôll take you out to dinner tonight.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do that.‚Äù ‚ÄúI bet you‚Äôd like to try out one of those buffets I told you about.‚Äù Her eyes widened.
 ‚ÄúA buffet?
 With lots of desserts?‚Äù He chuckled.
 ‚ÄúI know just the place.‚Äù Rick‚Äôs attentiveness calmed her, and she went to bed that night with a full stomach and an odd sense of security.

She was right.
 What surprised her was how Qurrah remained asleep as well.
 Dieredon had mentioned nocturnal visits between the other brother and the man in black, but she had no idea how long they lasted.
 For Qurrah to still slumber they must last for several hours, if not the entire night.
 She looked at him, sprawled out on a thick pile of straw, and wondered how he managed to walk, let alone cast spells as Harruq implied.
 His skin was pale and had a stretched look across his bones.
 He looked like a drained, emaciated version of his larger brother.
 _A good set of meals would do him wonders,_ Aurelia thought.
 Boring as it was, Aurelia sat down and prepared to wait.
 She glanced around, making sure there was no chance a wandering passerby could accidentally bump into her invisible form.

The absence of this simple system retards trade on the recently established commodity markets in Russia and other CIS countries.
 A complete listing of essential institutions, small and large, should be compiled, based on the experience of other nations, and plans drawn up for introducing them.
 Thus far, the development of social organizations, like the development of technologies, has been partial, piecemeal and sectoral, leaving large gaps between parallel and interrelated activities and institutions.
 This is especially evident at the international level where the organization of the collective social life of humanity is rudimentary and fragmentary, though far more complete than it was a few decades ago.
 In spite of the phenomenal growth in global communications, transportation, commerce, finance and tourism, it is still more difficult to carry out most activities internationally than it is domestically, because the international activities are not as well organized.
 For instance, transfer of technology still involves a process that is largely trial and error.
 Firms in developing countries seeking to acquire the best available technology for importation or acquisition have to search at considerable expenditure of time and money to discover what is available within their own country as well as overseas.
 The process of identifying and commercially transferring technology can be vastly simplified and accelerated by the establishment of international technology transfer corporations, sponsored by UN agencies such as UNESCO and UNIDO, specializing in all major fields of technology.
 These corporations should be operated on a commercial, for-profit basis, though governments of developing countries could become shareholders in order to promote their formation.
 Each corporation could undertake a detailed study of available technologies in its field and offer to assist corporate customers in developing countries in selecting the most appropriate technology to meet their needs.

 It was hard work.
 Jim ‚Äì How long did you play for?
 Eugene ‚Äì Twenty minutes.
 Johnny ‚Äì You blew through all ten dollars in just twenty minutes?
 Eugene ‚Äì What do you mean blew through?
 The arcade manager said he had never seen someone with my level of skill before in all his years of working at that arcade.
 In fact he said that he‚Äôd never forget the experience of watching me play.
 I‚Äôm just that good.
 Jim ‚Äì Did he say all of that with a strait face?

 Anyway, Memphis, yeah, it‚Äôs still part of that‚Äîthe signpost on the road.

Large get-togethers were common and we were often at some family event.
 The Greeks do love to host ambitious parties.
 Every birthday and holiday was a huge gathering with all sorts of foods we had never seen and as much as we tried, we couldn‚Äôt pronounce.
 Entire lambs roasted slowly over open pit fires.
 Hamburger rolled inside grape leaves.
 Lasagna in white sauce instead of red.
 We were not just in a new town, but in a whole new world.
 Thomas and I stuck together, were confidants and support for one another.
 We were getting older and wiser so we were more aware of what was going on around us.
 Our stepfather Dino turned out to be a mystery man with a past that didn‚Äôt add up and a temper that escalated with every drink he poured down his throat.

He may hate us all for all eternity, but I‚Äôm going to try anyway.
 I can‚Äôt just let him waste away like this.
 I‚Äôll do my best by him.
 That is about all I can offer him.
 It‚Äôs all I could ever offer him, and it was never enough, your mother saw to that.
 I failed him as a father so far.
 We‚Äôve all failed him.
 The entire world, even God.
 It‚Äôs no real wonder why he‚Äôs so damn angry with us all.
 I just hope we can reach to him before he decides to get revenge on life for the lot he has been cast.

I imagined the others‚ÄîRhys, Rider, and their dogs‚Äîwere somewhere near, though I couldn‚Äôt see them.
 Watchdogs, I thought, all four.
 It was comforting, but Ruby wasted no time in getting to training.
 She immediately trounced me.
 Repeatedly.
 I felt all kinds of defeated before we‚Äôd gone half an hour.

I am told to pull it up, but warned that it might easily disconnect and if it did, the bust would be aborted.
 After some light tugging on the mic to get it between my collar and my neck, Officer White says the sound is good.
 As we talk on the phone, he assures me that I am doing fine and I should continue to hold my position no matter how hard Ashley and Steve try to get me to go to their location.
 The attempt to move me is a tactic the narcotics‚Äô officers know well.
 The goal of the drug dealer will be to get me on his ground and on his terms.
 With so many officers surrounding me in a variety of cars, trucks, vans and on foot around the parking lot acting like patrons of the nearby stores, there is no way they could all uproot and follow me to some new location.
 Not to mention that marked police cars are waiting within striking distance of the retail center.
 I know the cops can hear everything I say so I spare them my nervous singing and limit my comments, fighting my compulsion to curse wickedly at them.
 I‚Äôm staring off across the wetlands, connecting with known drug dealers, talking to undercover narcotics officers on my personal cell phone, feeling a wire taped to my body and extending up to my neck, holding a bottle filled with one hundred Oxys in my jacket pocket.

Why didn‚Äôt I think of that?
 Eugene ‚Äì There were eight large hairy men, and they had knives and clubs.
 I assume you‚Äôve seen movies about bikers.
 Can we get on with the new name now?
 Jim ‚Äì Ah yes, biker movies, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd have made one of them a good wife anyways.
 Guess asking you to stop wouldn‚Äôt work for me after all.
 Liz ‚Äì I told you that you should start lifting weights, besides you might look cute in a leather jacket.
 Jim ‚Äì I think it‚Äôs easier not to piss large men off, then they have no reason to hurt me, and I have no reason to life weights, so I don‚Äôt need large muscles.
 Unless you count the appeal to chicks.
 Besides working out would require going out in that hot weather under that big hot shiny bright thing.

No matter how high or low his nose, or how wide or narrow his forehead, those burning eyes remained.
 ‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù Qurrah asked.
 Velixar laughed.
 ‚ÄúHow much do you know of the gods of this world, Qurrah Tun?‚Äù
 Qurrah shrugged.
 ‚ÄúI know their names and little else.
 Karak is death, Ashhur is life, and Celestia everything else, if the ramblings of priests and elves is to be believed.‚Äù
 Velixar nodded, the fire in his eyes growing.
 ‚ÄúThis world is young, Qurrah, and Karak and Ashhur are young gods.
 Only five-hundred years ago they came and gave life to man.‚Äù Those eyes twinkled.

 I figured that way he would at least stop calling me.
 Liz ‚Äì Oh, that‚Äôs all.

He has no car so he walks about one mile back on the shoulder of the narrow country road in Werner Springs as he talks to us.
 You can hear the crunching sound of the road‚Äôs gravel beneath his feet and imagine the gait of his walk from the delay between the sounds.
 The need for material objects is no longer what he desires and either are the drugs he once craved.
 We are touched by his compassion, his love and his maturity.
 We look forward to his call nightly and when we hear sirens, we feel sorrow for the parents whose visions are what ours once were.
 Our entire family welcomes our son back and we all realize that no matter how helpless a situation like drug addiction seems we now know that there is help, professional help.
 Most importantly, there is hope where there is love and there is love where there is family.
 Within any family and throughout the generations there will be many moments that define you as a person.
 If you are a father or a mother now, there was a day when you were a son or a daughter.
 Perhaps one day you will become a grandparent.

The effort of the international community to deal with these events has brought to the fore fundamental issues regarding national sovereignty and the responsibilities of the world community.
 The very definition and sanctity of the state have been blurred by the determination of ethnic groups in various nations to declare independence from their parent bodies, and the inability or unwillingness of national governments to maintain law and order and provide basic security for their citizens.
 The role of other states, regional organizations and international agencies in giving explicit or implicit support to these movements has further complicated the task of formulating just and practical solutions.
 These events raise questions about the rights of both nations and their citizens that have to be addressed theoretically before the role of international organizations in these affairs can be determined properly.
 Does a minority group within a country have the right to proclaim itself independent on the basis of its desire for self-governance and in defiance of the claims of the majority on the property and resources they possess?
 Does a national government, whether elected or in power by force, that is unable to protect its citizens against famine and civil strife have the right to insist on its sovereignty and independent action in the face of the persecution or extermination of its own people?
 What is the responsibility of the international community for preventing or alleviating crises within societies?
 What should be the limits placed on international involvement in the internal affairs of countries that, at least momentarily, are unable to help themselves?
 The sanctity of the sovereign state, like the sanctity of private property in a capitalist society, is a fundamental principle of the nation state system on which the present world community is based.
 Like the protectors of private property, the guardians of the sovereign state vigorously resist each attempt to limit its scope or qualify its power ‚Äì although in both instances there are obvious and well-recognized limits and qualifications.

And I didn‚Äôt know how I knew, but I was certain I didn‚Äôt want my memories back.
 What I had was already too much.
 I couldn‚Äôt fathom the pain Chevelle had suffered, surely a hundred times mine at the loss of my mother.
 His mother‚Ä¶ his father‚Ä¶ each member of his family?
 How much loss had he endured?
 Tears streamed down my face.
 Chevelle took a step toward me and I was struck by fear.
 He must despise me.
 That was why he‚Äôd become my watcher.
 He gave a curt nod at my reaction, his head still dipped as he walked away.

I was grateful when we finally stopped to make camp.
 I was afraid they would resume training after dinner, so I found a place off by myself and pretended to rest as I went back to reading the diary.
 Today was exhilarating.
 For the first time in I don‚Äôt know how long, I was out of the castle.
 Free from practice, free from duties, free from walls.
 Though tricky to set up, the spell worked on Rune.
 I showed up at practice early and whispered the words in case something went wrong and he heard.
 I can‚Äôt imagine what my punishment would have been, though it might have been worth it.
 He fell asleep quickly and I ran as fast as I could, my pulse pounding with excitement.
 I spent the entire day away from the castle.

But it also seems meet and right that one should try.
 Lennon said something about nothing being new in rock after ‚ÄúGreat Balls of Fire.‚Äù  In a sense, he‚Äôs right.
 I mean, I‚Äôd never question his authority.
 But, we still try, right?
 He still tries, God bless him.

 The lyrics.
 That‚Äôs what you really have to talk about, the lyrics.
 I don‚Äôt think anyone would claim any rock song is today‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Second Coming,‚Äù ‚Äìexcept, maybe some critics who want to call Dylan our Dante.
 But, the words are what‚Äôs become important.

He was still unclear of how strong and fast he was.
 His stomach hurt from his wound, but not as badly as it should.
 Clearly, the first step in his duty was to heal up from his wound and relearn how to fight in his new body.
 When he got up, Imeralda was already standing but Doi‚Äôvan remained kneeling in thought.
 He nodded to Imeralda and she quietly followed him back into the barn.
 About ten minutes later Doi‚Äôvan joined them and they started to plan how to clean up the barn.
 There was also the matter of the house, which was a more natural place for the three of them to shelter, but Rodregas was unsure of the Dire Cats.
 They decided to spend the rest of the morning cleaning up the barn for the horses, and then, after lunch, Rodregas would go and see if he could figure out the intentions of the lionesses.
 With the three of them working, they cleaned up the barn quickly.
 While they were able to move the dirt and debris out, it was still just bare walls and stone floors.

Britney had to ask me a question twice before I realized she'd been talking.
 "Sorry, I was thinking about something."
 "Hmm, what distracted you?"
 I debated dodging the question, but it was normal to talk about boys.
 "There was a guy and a girl who walked by earlier when we were at your locker."
 A knowing look flashed across Britney's face.
 "Oh, their royal highnesses Alec and Jasmin.
 They're pretty distracting all right, but don't waste your time.
 They'll never waste a thought on you or me, or pretty much anyone."
 The way she said their names implied they were a couple.

"Can I join you guys?"
 Her voice was scratchy, and her eyes were red from crying, but she was putting on a brave face, and Rachel didn't even hesitate.
 "Of course, Jess.
 We figured you wanted some privacy with Isaac, or we would've dragged you over here hours ago."
 The rest of us were quick to pipe in, but at least on my side, the sentiment was a little half-hearted.
 Unlike Jasmin, Jessica never had come around, never made her peace with the fact that because of me things were going to go downhill in a hurry after tonight.
 I'd tried to get both Rachel and Dominic to explain why she hated me so much, but neither would give me a real explanation.
 Rachel would always just get mad and say there was no excuse for how Jess was acting.
 Dominic always refused to say anything other than that Jessica had been through her own set of struggles, and had her reasons for her behavior.
 "I'll be done with Dom in just a moment, Jess, then I'll fix your hair while Rachel finishes up with Adri."

Employment is not a zero sum game.
 Computerization: The exciting growth of ICT-based service exports by no means exhausts the potential contribution of computers to growth of employment opportunities.
 Computerization is not merely a field or sector of commercial activity.
 The computer is an instrument and a catalyst that can stimulate creation of employment and self-employment opportunities in virtually every field ‚Äì from farming, fishing and textile designing to lean manufacturing, financial services, bio-informatics and genetic engineering.
 While the application of computers has already been extended to all these fields, there has not yet been a systematic effort to assess the employment potential that can be tapped by fully extending and accelerating this movement.
 The recent initiative in India to establish knowledge centres in every Indian village by 2007 is one example of a pioneering effort to harness ICT as a means to catalyze a whole range of on-farm and off-farm rural activities, which will inevitably translate into more and higher productivity and greater employment generation.
 These centres can be utilized to deliver technological expertise to upgrade farm yields, vocational training and education, purchasing and marketing information to raise incomes.
 The experience of India also shows that bridging the digital divide helps to bridge the gender divide in the area of knowledge and skill-intensive work.
 As the construction of rural roads acts as a stimulus to agricultural development of isolated communities by connecting them with sources of inputs and markets in the outer world, ICT can be a catalyst for stimulating the entire gamut of economic activities in rural communities throughout the developing world.
 At the other end of the spectrum, ICT is opening up unparalleled opportunities for self-employment and new business creation for the educated.

Addressing these challenges will require a substantial increase in financial resources devoted to education.
 In most regions, public expenditure on education has risen in recent years.
 In 1990, the world average was 13.5 per cent of total government expenditure, or 4.8 per cent of GNP.
 More than one-third of the countries in the world still spend more on the military than on education.
 Efforts to improve education must go hand in hand with efforts to promote peace and disarmament and drastically curtail military spending.
 Mechanisms should be put in place to insure that a significant portion of reduced military spending is invested in education and training.
 The very highest social priority should be given to six educational goals in both developing and developed countries.
 First, there must be a massive effort to achieve UNESCO‚Äôs goal of eradicating illiteracy worldwide by the year 2000.
 The problem can only be banished by an all-out commitment of every national government to eliminate the huge backlog of illiteracy, while at the same time insuring that every child is taught to read and write.
 National youth service corps and military personnel can be utilized to help provide the necessary manpower.

My mom was lecturing about prepositions.
 After a minute, she issued a reading assignment, followed me to a patio behind her room, and collapsed onto the picnic bench when I told her Eric was dead.
 ‚ÄúOh God,‚Äù she moaned.
 ‚ÄúNot again.‚Äù Cliff, Billy and I drove to their home.
 We spent an hour or so on an art project they were creating.
 They intended to draw a million small circles, just to see what a million looked like.
 Taking turns, we drew about 20,000.
 Evelyn, their mom, kept appearing, offering food.
 Sometime before dark I left and wandered alone, toward and up a hill called Eastridge that overlooked our school, along a street of vacant lots, sometimes escaping into in my usual obsessions about Karen Flagstad or whether I should play baseball or golf that spring.
 But after a moment, the truth returned.

Going in normal street clothes would've cheapened the experience, but I hadn't wanted to stick out too much from the rest of the kids, all of whom I'd been pretty sure would be in shorts and polos.
 I'd been right, which had made me glad I'd compromised and come in my one and only sun dress.
 Alec apparently hadn't gotten the memo.
 He was in an honest-to-goodness full tux.
 I wasn't the only one stunned by how good he looked; there was a ripple of turned heads as people noticed his entrance.
 He paced the short distance down to the back row of seats with such incredible grace that I felt my mouth go dry.
 No one person should be so attractive, not when there wasn't enough of him to go around to every single woman in the world.
 For a few seconds I forgot all about the reasons I didn't like him, and just wished he was sitting in front of me instead of two rows behind me where I couldn't see him.
 Then I realized what his arrival really meant.
 Rachel had stood me up.

 She doesn‚Äôt believe she can get close to anyone‚Ä¶ that way.‚Äù I considered the way she was with me, as if she wanted us to be friends, the way she touched Steed, sat near him.
 ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù ‚ÄúPast experiences.‚Äù Yes, she‚Äôd killed her mother.
 And how many others?
 What had she said, until a pattern became noticeable?
 I shivered at the thought.
 ‚ÄúPoison.‚Äù He nodded in silent acknowledgement.
 ‚ÄúIn the village, some of the elves never paired up.‚Äù I thought of Junnie‚Äôs family.
 ‚ÄúBut I guess most of those had received the calling.‚Äù Grey scoffed ahead of us.

Where did Karak‚Äôs prophet linger now that the battle had ended?
 There was only one way to find out.
 He would have to escape the town, regardless of the patrols that swarmed the area.
 He waited until nightfall.
 Even in the dark the elves still patrolled, carrying no torches for their keen eyes had no trouble seeing in the starlight.
 The longer he hid and watched, the more Qurrah was convinced they searched for him.
 The Neldaren troops were long gone, Harruq with them.
 He knew he was being paranoid, but the only other person they could be searching for was Velixar, and the elves were deluding themselves if they thought they could handle him.
 When a smaller patrol turned a corner and vanished, he opened the door, winked at the bloody corpse near the window, and then slipped into the night.
 The scent of mourning floated throughout the town, and he paused to enjoy the bittersweet strands of death that tugged on his heart.

Technology of organization
 Much emphasis is placed on the widening gap in technology between North and South, but the gap in the technology of organization is even greater.
 Creation of new types of systems and organizations can create markets and jobs in many ways.
 The Dutch system of flower auction co-operatives is so successful that 68 per cent of the entire world‚Äôs exports of cut flowers pass through markets in the Netherlands.
 The franchise system has led to a rapid proliferation of new businesses and new jobs in the West in such widely diverse fields as food services, home remodelling, dry cleaning and real estate.
 Industrial estates, export processing zones, export promotion councils, export insurance, warehouse receipts, quality standards, and thousands of other organizational innovations have been either created or borrowed by developing countries to accelerate social progress.
 A comprehensive study of successful systems and institutions that can be transferred and adapted to local conditions will document the enormous untapped potential for stimulating faster economic and job growth by inventing, imitating and further improving social systems.
 Action Plan to Stimulate Employment in Developing Countries
 Employment generation is a product of multiple factors that combine together.
 Stimulating job creation requires a comprehensive approach, rather than partial policies or piecemeal strategies.

I thought I was past all of this recovery stuff."
 He looked concerned but I'd learned to read his expressions better than I think he realized.
 He was worried, but not just about me.
 He spent a lot of time worrying.
 The rest of the pack, the town, his mother, his sister.
 It was a lot for someone our age to deal with.
 "There's an uncommon amount of that going around right now."
 Alec shook his head at my curious stare.
 "Dom and Jasmin both seem to be spending more time in bed than you'd expect based on the wounds they took putting down Cassie and the others.
 Isaac moved like an old man when we spared yesterday and Donovan is looking old lately."

Clutter, but, taken as a whole, it all made sense.
 She called it Plat-Eye Manor, after her dog, Plat-Eye.
 Her three-headed dog.
 (laughs)  That was some dog, used to sit next to me and fix me with its glassy eye, just sit there for hours, man, and I‚Äôd end up thinking we were talking.
 I can still remember some of the conversations I had with that damned dog.
 It was black and tan, mostly black‚Äîwhat was it, a mix, part Rottweiler and part hellhound.
 There was no place for the eye to rest, no blank walls, no white spaces.
 And this is like Lorelei herself, really, she is made up of so many parts, she‚Äôs a Steppenwolf, in the best sense of that word, a house of mirrors, each part of her reflects a different part of yourself once you get to know her or her you, you dig?
 Anyway, I spent a good half-hour just looking around, while she stood aside and observed me.
 I was spellbound, pixilated.

Though in truth the horses seemed to be getting more agitated.
 As the magic smoothed out Rodregas smiled and said, ‚ÄúThe ley line would be as much of a problem as a help unless, of course, the farmhouse is made of Nymph stone.‚Äù Rodregas expected the sound of pleased surprise but instead heard alarmed in-drawn breaths from them both; he saw that they were looking to the right, where he suddenly noticed movement.
 Two female Dire Cats stepped out of the orchard and made their way to the farmhouse.
 They had a relaxed, bored look.
 He thought that they gave him a casual nod, but he could not actually see any movement.
 Rodregas simply knew that these were the two Dire Cats that he had freed from the Dungeon.
 ‚ÄúDid everyone from that dungeon follow me?‚Äù he whispered to himself.
 The three stood there fighting to keep the horses from running and watched as the Dire Cats stepped through the main door for a moment, but left after only a short wait.
 The Dire Cats then circled the main building and went over to the far edge of the main house and then simply disappeared.
 Rodregas said, ‚ÄúI think they just went into the cellar of the home.

Initial Results of Reform
 The pre-existent conditions, the starting point of the transition, the timing, speed and extent of the reforms introduced during the past five years varied considerably among the 25 nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
 But, with few exceptions, they were founded on the same general principles and on the policy recommendations of Western proponents of rapid transformation to total free-market liberal capitalism, based on a simultaneous shock strategy encompassing macro-economic stabilization, prices and property rights.
 Western governments and the international financial institutions, led by the IMF, strongly advocated this approach and linked financial assistance to its adoption.
 The strategy called for rapid deregulation of prices, privatization of farms and industry, introduction of a convertible currency, and balancing the budget to reduce the high fiscal deficits, primarily by reducing military expenditure and subsidies to producers and consumers.
 The assumption was that a programme with these elements would result in a significant increase in production, efficiency and the availability of consumer goods within a short time.
 The actual results were quite contrary to the expectations of these countries‚Äô Western economic advisers, as well as to the governments and people of the region.
 The initial phase of reforms had a disastrous impact on the economies, on the people and in some countries on peace and political stability.
 From 1990 to 1993 production in all 25 nations declined drastically, from a minimum of 10 per cent in Poland, 20 percent in Hungary and 22 per cent in the Czech Republic to a maximum of 45 per cent in Russia, 57 per cent in Latvia and 75 per cent in Armenia.
 Investment fell by an average rate of 13 ‚Äì14 per cent per year from 1990 to 1992, and by a three-year total of more than 50 per cent in Russia.

"Well, I'll probably have to work late tomorrow too."
 She stared at him in dismay.
 "That's the surprise?"

 "No.
 I have to work late because of the surprise.
 I have quite a bit of vacation time coming, and I thought I'd take some next week.
 Since I'm not giving much notice, I have a lot of things I have to take care of tomorrow."
 If a vacation was the surprise, it must include her, but she didn't want to make any assumptions.

I was wrong.
 The boy wasn't as cute as Alec, but he was so close I could hear those cosmic scales being melted down into something useless again.
 Paperweights maybe.
 I didn't want to see the mess my water had made of his shirt, so I started at the top and worked my way down.
 I'd seen better hair in a couple of fashion magazines, but not very many.
 Casually windswept, straight blond hair had become iconic sometime in the last few years, and this boy either spent an hour on his hair each morning, or the wind in Utah was kinder and gentler than the wind in Minnesota.
 Kinder, and currently working on its cosmetology license.
 His skin was exquisitely tanned, lighter than Jasmin or Alec's, but exactly suited to his lighter hair tone.
 Friendly gray eyes perfectly spaced above some of the most natural looking white teeth I'd ever seen.
 My heart would have started slowing down if I'd been sure the display of teeth was a smile, but there was something about the expression that defied classification.

 Marie had been looking forward to going to the Cape, but listening to her mother talk about it, she wasn't so sure she was up to going.
 She needed the familiarity of home.
 She went up to her room soon after Tom left.
 She hadn't bought a stuffed animal for Rick's t-shirt, so she spread the shirt over a pillow.
 After she'd changed into a nightgown, she clutched his handkerchief in her fist and sat down in the rocking chair by her bed.
 She wished she'd gone to the library today--she'd like to have something to occupy her mind.
 She-- There was a tap at her door.

They had to clear a path to get the wagon in.
 Imeralda ran her hand over the stone with a surprisingly gentle caress.
 ‚ÄúIt is Nymph stone, right?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 She nodded and said, ‚ÄúYes, I am half Forest Nymph and half AElf and this is beautiful work.‚Äù All Nymphs have a specific attachment to nature such as forest, stone or water.
 There was a lot of variation among the Nymphs, but they could do amazing things with their element.
 A connection to stone is much sought after by mages.
 The stone could not store magic like the circles but it could smooth out the high level of magic available on ley lines and make it more comfortable to use, not in the big way of the magic of circles, but for using magic in small ways.
 And, of course, only homes made by nymphs could make living on a ley line comfortable.
 ‚ÄúThis home truly is a find,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan, ‚Äúand now I see why the Dire Cats showed themselves to us.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúDire Beasts seek such places to lair,‚Äù answered Doi‚Äôvan.

Even then though, it was becoming pretty clear that we couldn't have two separate packs in such close proximity.
 The need to keep the pack strong meant that even though she pretty much ran the show most of the time there was the occasional thing that I'd just refuse to back down on."
 His muscles tightened unconsciously, like maybe he was remembering past pains.
 "She'd rip me up one side and down the other but on the most important stuff I'd simply out stubborn her.
 When the dust settled usually I at least got a compromise we could both live with."
 I hugged him tighter for a second.
 "That sounds a lot like what you guys do right now, just the other way around."
 "Yeah.
 That's about the size of it.
 She's still hiding something from me, but I'm not willing to bleed her to try and get an answer, not when odds are she'll just refuse to tell me anyways."

I was even worse than normal when it came to drawing people or animals, but I had a good memory for everything else.
 I pushed the notepad away in frustration, and then started shaking as I finally recognized my drawing.
 It was the grotto from my dream, and the reason I hadn't filled in the center was that I'd never seen it.
 That was the spot where Alec had been standing.
 Chapter 13 Morning came not a moment too soon after a night filled with tossing and turning.
 Every time I nodded off, I awoke a few minutes later, my mind reaching for something that wasn't there, only to snap back as it didn't find what it was looking for.
 Each time the backlash woke me up, I tried to figure out what was going on, but I didn't succeed until nearly morning.
 I'd been trying to find the vivid dreams again.
 I'd finally stopped thinking about them, finally stopped yearning for them every night, only to have my stupid subconscious somehow mix them up with real life.
 That was really the thing that was the most unnerving.

Britney's proclivity towards gossip was a complete godsend when you wanted to find out information about someone.
 "Jasmin?
 I don't know, people don't say very much about her.
 She's got an incredible temper though."
 "She's dating Alec right?"
 Britney nodded emphatically.
 "I've never seen them kiss or hold hands, but they've got to be.
 She's totally rebuffed everyone, and he's never evidenced even the slightest interest in any other girl.
 Plus, they're like the two hottest people in the entire school.
 How could they possibly date anyone else?"

It didn't really matter.
 I waited the requisite fifteen minutes and then went back out to the U-Haul and got another box.
 Mom followed me out this time.
 I guess she was worried again.
 Even worries about school wouldn't cushion me now that I'd had an attack today.
 There was nothing left but to wrap myself in numbness as I traveled back and forth between the truck and the house in a slow-moving haze.
 The truck was the smallest one they rented, and we hadn't come even close to filling it up, but it was still dark by the time we finished.
 Mom looked at the mass of boxes, groaned dramatically, and then went to the fridge and broke out the sandwiches we'd purchased when we stopped in town for directions.
 An hour later our beds were made, and I had an outfit laid out for school the next day.
 The clothes weren't mine.

I finally found the exit and was halfway down the hall when I heard voices for the first time.
 While it didn't sound like anyone was out-and-out yelling, they weren't the calm voices of friendly conversation.
 I quickly reversed direction, and found an external door less than a minute later.
 The voices had faded away to nearly nothing as I'd gotten further away from them, but all of a sudden they peaked into a full-blown yelling match, punctuated with an incredible crash that sent a tremor through the entire house.
 Any thoughts I'd had about trying to find a phone and calling 911 vanished as full flight instinct took a hold.
 A few seconds later I was outside and running.
 The moon was so obscured by clouds it provided only minimal light, but even the poor visibility couldn't convince me to slow my flight through the near jungle waiting outside the house.
 I could barely make out the stone path that led through the garden, but I stumbled along it as quickly as I could with my sprained ankle, deciding between branches in the path completely at random.
 I'd only been running for a few seconds when lightning tore its first gash in the night sky and opened up the way for a monsoon-like rainstorm.
 Within a few seconds the cold rain was falling so hard that I couldn't see even a few feet ahead of me.

And even though he was my watcher, my captor, I had to admit I felt less alone with Chevelle there.
 Steed pulled his own ration from the spit and sat on my other side as we all watched the surface of the lake.
 And beyond it, mountains.
 The mountains at dawn were so much more intimidating and I was hesitant to leave our camp.
 Everything had begun to seem real.
 I tried to distract myself as we rode east around the lake, attempting to name the species of plants as Junnie might have made me, but there were so many I had never seen that it started to remind me of the difference rather than distract me from it.
 So I bantered with Steed regarding horses and imps and everything I could come up with to keep him talking.
 Chevelle rode quietly behind us, scanning our surroundings.
 I wasn‚Äôt sure if he was enjoying the scenery or playing lookout.
 We rode a few days into the base of the mountains.

The tent is ripped from the ground and tumbles away leaving a clear view of the black helicopter that is lowering itself closer to the ground.
 The helicopter is about thirty feet above the ground, and now just behind the podium, over the limos.
 The side door slides open revealing two men in black suits.
 Everyone starts to dive for cover.
 I am seated next to Grandpa but I am now flat on the ground with the rest of the crowd attempting to duck the flying flowers, tripods, and debris, expecting a shower of bullets.
 Chairs are scattering as they tip over and who knows what those two men in the helicopter are going to do?
 I look up and the only man standing is Grandpa who has his arms in the air as the wind from the copter pounds him and ripples his suit like a flag in the wind.
 This deeply religious (and senile) old man proclaims loudly ‚Äúthe lord has come to take my son!‚Äù and he continues to repeat this line as if he is a TV preacher in a revival tent.
 I have an eye on the copter and a hand on Grandpa‚Äôs leg as I attempt to pull him to the ground with the rest of us.
 People are barely audible but they are screaming and crying and in total panic.

Then you'll see what I mean."
 She did, marveling at the beauty of perfectly clear blue skies above and white powder puffs below.
 The clouds looked so soft and fluffy that she wished she could bounce on them.
 The trip was exciting.
 The flight attendant brought them peanuts and Coke, and Rick bought them headphones so that they could watch a movie.
 And then she brought them dinner!
 It wasn't very good, but Rick said that they could get some pizza as soon as they got to Hollywood.
 At the airport they got their luggage and rented a car.
 Marie looked around eagerly as Rick drove to the hotel, but so far it didn't look much different from 2011 Boston.
 "Where are the studios we'll be touring?"

Like ‚ÄúMary Had a Little Lamb.‚Äù Consciously so?
 BG:  	A children‚Äôs song?
 Shit.
 No.
 It‚Äôs about being in bed with a new woman.
 It‚Äôs about that moment of intimacy after you‚Äôve spent each other, that time when you‚Äôre running your fingers over each other‚Äôs bodies, asking about little nooks and crannies, scars and tattoos.
 I said this to a woman‚Äîthe ‚Äúwhite swan woman‚Äù in the song‚Äîafter our first intercourse.
 I said to her, ‚ÄúIf you push your belly button‚Ä¶‚Äù and she laughed long and hard.
 It became code between us, code for post-coital pleasures.
 By the way, the song makes reference to an actual quote.

Realizing the lecture wouldn't do me any good, I pulled out my book, and started reading the next section in my self-appointed study regimen.
 Mrs. Campbell either understood what I was trying to accomplish, or was saving up all her venom for after class.
 She didn't call on me even once.
 Britney wasn't so lucky, and I caught a nasty look from her each time I surfaced from my textbook.
 The glares angered me more than I'd expected.
 I was having to catch up on a month's worth of assignments; she didn't have any right to get pissy just because she wasn't prepared.
 The third time it happened, I stopped pretending not to notice and shot Britney a sugar-sweet look of my own.
 She didn't quite seem to know how to take that and the rest of the class passed quickly.
 All too soon, it was time to go up and talk to Mrs. Campbell.
 I put off the ordeal as long as I could, waiting until everyone but Britney and I had exited the room.

‚ÄúOkay, but you‚Äôll probably regret it.‚Äù ‚ÄúJust give her the short version, Ruby,‚Äù Steed interrupted.
 ‚ÄúNo gory details.‚Äù His eyebrow cocked meaningfully.
 ‚ÄúOh, well, yes, that would do.‚Äù She smiled at me as she licked another arrow, tongue sliding carefully along the blade.
 ‚ÄúYou see, my dear, being a one of a kind‚Äîwell, as far as I know‚Äîhas its benefits.
 Though they weren‚Äôt always benefits.
 Ooh, in the beginning it was bad‚Ä¶ but, well, that‚Äôs the long version, isn‚Äôt it?
 No gory details.‚Äù She winked at Steed.
 ‚ÄúI am, how should I put it‚Ä¶ venomous.‚Äù I gasped.
 It was her expected response.
 ‚ÄúYes, yes.

Just in case an opportunity presented itself to earn some brownie points.
 "Mrs. Alexander, I read something about water around reactor cores giving off a blue light.
 Can you explain how that works?"
 I'd expected something stupid, but glowing water made me think of the vivid dreams.
 I listened as intently as I'd ever listened to anything, and did my best to follow all of the diagrams as Mrs. Alexander attempted to break a college-level concept down into something fairly average high-school students could follow.
 "So, in short, really it's a matter of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms attempting to shed the excess energy they've gained from the radioactive particles emitted from the core.
 The energized electrons give off radiation in the visible light spectrum during the process of dropping down to a lower energy state."
 Hmm, an interesting concept, but still not an explanation for how the water in my dream had given off a soft golden glow, one that had rippled with the movement of the water.
 Almost before I'd realized it, my hand shot up.
 "Is the light always blue?

‚ÄúMaster," Rodregas said, with a respectful bow, "The prisoners are ready.‚Äù Ravenhurr looked up.
 His eyes passed over Rodregas to glance at the prisoners.
 He nodded without a word and went back to peering through the tube.
 Rodregas had never understood how the stars in the night sky could make the world closer or farther away from the Celestial Realm, where the Gods lived, or how that could affect magic, but he knew the placement of the stars was critical to the success of the ceremony tonight.
 Ravenhurr was an attractive man, like most of the Immortalist Sorcerers.
 After all, if you can pick your body, why would you ever choose an ugly one?
 Rodregas looked over again at the man that he had brought up the stairs.
 With the ability to select your body you would choose someone like that: attractive, talented and a natural athlete.
 Rodregas stood to the side waiting for Ravenhurr‚Äôs signal.
 Ravenhurr raised his head up from the tube again and scanned the rooftop making sure all the parts of the ceremony were in place.

No images flickered behind my lids, yet my eyes did not open.
 The muffle in my ears from the drowning dreams was gone.
 I could hear clearly, clearer than I‚Äôd ever heard.
 I hadn‚Äôt found my body yet, but I heard conversations, voices I knew.
 They were whispers but they were clear.
 I listened, hoping to gain clarity‚Ä¶ but something was still wrong.
 Nothing fit.
 They discussed Junnie and Anvil and Fannie, but those all felt like two sets of people now.
 They were worried; I could hear the stress in their tones.
 How long had I been like this?

I might have run back to the village right then, but they would never release me.
 I had nothing.
 I glanced down the mountainside.
 I couldn‚Äôt have found my way back if I‚Äôd wanted to.
 I had no idea where I was.
 I stared at my palms, some spell-bought map carved into my skin, and was hit full force with the knowledge that I didn‚Äôt even know where I was going.
 I was about as low on options as I could get.
 If not for Chevelle‚Äôs desire to skip out on Council business for a few days, or whatever we were doing here, I‚Äôd already be imprisoned.
 I could hope that with the dreams, with the mountains, with wherever my family‚Äôs map was taking me, I could remember more, could break some part free.
 It was all I would have in my captivity.

Infrastructure and production facilities have become a principal target of military action.
 Food supplies are frequently the first major casualty and most lethal weapon.
 A single explosion can paralyze a major metropolis or contaminate an entire region with toxic material, dwarfing the devastation caused by the industrial accidents at Chernobyl and Bhopal.
 The disruption of trade resulting even from regional conflicts such as the Gulf War or the war in Bosnia, impacts not only on the economies of the belligerents, but also on neighbours, trading partners and global economic performance.
 Neither the victor nor the victim can any longer afford to resolve conflicts violently.
 Political states may still be able to survive wars, but developmental achievements can not.
 So long as the benefits of development are confined to one or a few sections of society, the costs of militarization and war may not prevent economic and social progress.
 But when the need is to fulfil the rising expectations of the masses by extending the benefits of development to the entire society ‚Äì thus enabling the society as a whole to move to the next higher level of collective affluence and fulfilment ‚Äì every social resource must be garnered and harnessed for this purpose.
 The colossal cost of armaments and the catastrophic destruction of war are incompatible with the achievement of prosperity for all.
 Peace has become the fundamental imperative for development.

I stood up and examined myself.
 I was wearing light brown hunting boots and tight black pants made out of some sort of light cloth.
 A thick woven jacket was shielding me from the October cold.
 When I looked back at Seth, I realized he had also made an outfit change.
 He was wearing black leather boots and dark blue pants.
 His top was a short, brown cloak with a hood and leather belt.
 A beautiful steel sword with an ornamental hilt was swinging at his side from a woven sheath.
 ‚ÄúOh well, I guess I have green hair.
 It‚Äôs not that bad.
 I like green.‚Äù I rambled as I examined the short hunting knife that was resting in a small sheath on my hip.

Vague suspicions that people had known about Jasmin's threats vanished, driven away by the truth that Britney had been gossiping about me just the way she gossiped about everyone else.
 Rachel grabbed my arm as I tensed up.
 "I don't know what you're going to do, but maybe you shouldn't get up yet."
 I looked over at Rachel's concerned face and opened my mouth to thank her for whispering, for keeping my secret, only the words didn't come out.
 Instead the image of Alec, the one that had burned itself onto my retinas a few seconds previously just as it had done in physics when I'd looked over to see his broken pencil, flared back into life before my eyes.
 "You knew there was another time.
 Alec told you about Physics."
 Rachel opened her mouth, probably to deny it, but the look in her eyes told me it was true.
 She couldn't possibly be that scared about me putting two and two together if he'd been saying nice things about me.
 He hated me, and she was scared of him, scared of what he'd do if he found out she'd let his secret slip.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not going back.‚Äù Chevelle‚Äôs tone, level and uncompromising, caught my attention.
 I pushed the hood back to better hear and the taller figure glared at me as he hissed, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre protecting her when you know what she‚Äôs capable of?‚Äù I flinched at his words, but something else had caught my eye.
 The robes were ornate, the tassels interwoven with color.
 He was Grand Council.
 I studied the other newcomer, who acted as if I wasn‚Äôt present.
 He was incredulous, staring at Chevelle when he spoke.
 ‚ÄúHer mother slaughtered your clan, your family.
 Why release this terror‚Äî‚Äù The man‚Äôs words were cut short, his face contorted in pain.
 Chevelle had gone rigid, every muscle tense.
 The councilman struggled, suffering from some unseen force.

Classes, shit man, how could anyone concentrate on classes with that going on?
 Most of my teachers hated me anyway, you know, rock and roll, devil‚Äôs music, my hair was longer than most of my classmates, I insisted on wearing these combat boots, even in summer when sweating in them was like wearing a swamp on each foot, and I had attitude, of course.
 Rock and roll attitude.
 I was unassailable, untouchable.
 Of course the teachers hated me.
 One in particular, tried to get me expelled, suspended, something, because I wore an American Flag on my butt.
 (laughs)  It sounds funny now.
 I had this peace symbol, you know, the two finger symbol made of stars and stripes, and, Jesus, my mother sewed it on the back pocket of my jeans.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve set up a perimeter.‚Äù It was all I had to say for the moment.
 I felt empty, alone.
 It was dark; even with the dust I‚Äôd not slept through the night.
 I sat up, curling my legs against my chest, and wrapped my arms around them, pulling tightly in.
 Though I didn‚Äôt speak, I occasionally glanced, or glared, at Ruby.
 She sat, immobile, watching me.
 It was morning before she broke.
 ‚ÄúYou have your fire back.‚Äù It hadn‚Äôt occurred to me.
 I held my hand out and flicked a flame above my palm, then promptly extinguished it.
 I tried moving a stone from the ground to no avail.

 And don‚Äôt forget that Pig Latin and Klingon don‚Äôt count real languages.
 When he does say something it‚Äôs usually so pointless and offensive that any chicks who might have managed to overlook his bizarre hair and lack of physical mass would be so insulted that they would probably try to kill the annoying little bastard.
 Jim ‚Äì Don‚Äôt even compare Batman to Sumo Assassin!
 Batman is a weakling in a stupid costume with some gizmos, without his gizmos he‚Äôs just a loser in tights.
 All Sumo Assassin has to protect him from his enemies are, his Sumo Loin Cloth, and his Sumo Fighting Skills.
 They‚Äôre all he needs.
 Hell the loincloth isn‚Äôt even bullet proof.
 On top of that the Sumo-mobile can outrun the Bat-mobile any day of the week, not to mention the fact that its solar powered so its earth friendly.

It felt like there was electricity surging back and forth between Vincent and Isaac, making my skin feel too small.
 The tension suddenly flickered like a dying light bulb.
 "Vincent!"
 I was disoriented for a second.
 The yell had come from behind me, and had torn the two apart faster than I'd believed possible.
 The crowd, packed so tightly that I'd been worried someone was going to get pushed over the railing, separated as Alec flowed down the stairs.
 I'd only thought Isaac and Vincent were graceful.
 Alec made them look like drunken frat boys.
 Vincent spun around so fast it almost looked like he was going to fall down and then backed away from both of them like a cornered animal.
 It was hard to decide whether my excitement at seeing the biggest jerk I'd ever met humbled outweighed my dislike for Alec, who'd pretty much locked up the honor of being the second biggest jerk.

‚ÄúTwo weeks,‚Äù she said.
 The elf danced away behind a tree.
 Harruq followed, but all he caught when he stepped around was a tiny line of blue fading on the afternoon wind.
 ‚ÄúThat was interesting,‚Äù he said before returning to Woodhaven.

 Deeper in the forest, Aurelia stepped out of a glowing blue portal.
 An elf waited there, an ornate bow slung across his back.
 ‚ÄúSo do you think it could be him?‚Äù he asked her.
 ‚ÄúPerhaps,‚Äù Aurelia said.

‚ÄúIt was an accident.
 I didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôd run that way.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlright, we understand that we‚Äôve all done stupid, foolish things.
 So let‚Äôs just add this accident to my list, okay?‚Äù I said quickly before the two started something.
 They nodded but shot each other smirks.
 I sighed, wondering why those two buffoons had been granted this power along, with Emily and me.
 It‚Äôs not like they weren‚Äôt foolish enough already.
 The day when it all changed was still a mystery to us.
 A lot of things happened that didn‚Äôt quite make sense.
 The four of us were already best friends.
 We were walking through the woods, rambling on about how Halloween was almost here and that Ms. Stecher was still giving us too much homework.

 The half-orc‚Äôs jaw dropped a little.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve lost your mind?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI said hit me, orc!‚Äù Aurelia shouted.
 Harruq snarled, and out came his weapons.
 He swung for her face, turning the blade at the last moment so the flat side struck her.
 The sword smacked off Aurelia‚Äôs cheek as if she were made of stone.
 The clear noise rang throughout the forest.
 ‚ÄúWhat the abyss was that?‚Äù Harruq asked.
 Aurelia laughed.

Dominic's presence as she stepped around the corner seemed to be the deciding factor.
 Brandon gave us another lazy smile as he stepped slowly backwards to give us more room.
 Alec's tone was still conversational as he shoved Vincent backwards and allowed his hand to return to normal.
 "The harassment of my people stops now."
 "Now why would we do a thing like that when we all know you're a dead man?"
 Dominic stopped just outside of what I was starting to understand was pouncing range for people who happened to have supernatural strength, as Alec gave Brandon a cold smile.
 "If I ever really decide the outcome is a foregone conclusion, you'd better start watching out for your people.
 You'd be surprised just how many of them could disappear if I no longer worried about the consequences of my actions."
 The tingle of Alec's power lessened slightly once we were out of sight, but it still hadn't dropped off completely by the time we were standing in front of Mrs. Tiggs' classroom.
 I could still feel the faintest traces of his power long after he'd finally let my hand go with obvious reluctance and strode off, leaving Dominic and I to find our seats.

We lived with our grandparents longer than we should have, but my mother had little choice.
 My mother, still young and very attractive, was saddled with the responsibility of two young boys who knew nothing about her predicament.
 She made sure we never felt like we were a burden, but as I look back I know it must have been so difficult for her.
 She never complained and we always felt her love.
 She worked as a carhop at a Bob‚Äôs Big Boy hamburger joint and she wore roller skates to serve the drive up customers in their cars.
 My Uncle Dan would take us there at night to visit her and she could sometimes sneak us some food.
 We would watch her roller-skating from car to car and back inside to retrieve her food orders.
 Uncle Dan was a hero to us as he was the only consistent male figure in our life.
 The drive up stations at Bob‚Äôs Big Boy were filled with a variety of Hot Rods and they were in all shapes, colors and sizes.
 The engines revved and the tires squealed consistently as the parade of cars cruised through.

 ‚ÄúTomorrow night, come to me,‚Äù Velixar said.

 Qurrah stood and bowed before his new master.
 ‚ÄúI will be here,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúAnd I will be ready.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúGo.‚Äù Velixar waved his hand, and Qurrah obeyed.

 Well, sort of locked up.
 I mean, I could have left.
 There were no bars or anything.

It made sense, but didn't really help me fill in any of the broad holes that had been bothering me for so long.
 Mallory gave me several seconds to ponder her answer before continuing.
 "How is the rest of the pack?
 Alec will tell me, but he'll filter his answer through what he thinks I'm able to hear, not necessarily what I need to hear."
 "They're worried.
 Jessica and James seem to be the most unsettled by everything that's happened, but I think everyone is more or less concerned.
 Is there someone in particular that you were curious about?"
 Mallory hesitated for a moment, and then nodded.
 "How does Donovan seem to be doing?"
 The question took me completely by surprise.

"You're in trouble now."
 He released her and then squirted her.
 Laughing again, Marie twirled in the spray.
 "This is fun!"
 Rick shook his head, grinning.
 "What am I going to do with you?"
 Dropping the hose, he went to hug her.
 "You're absolutely incorrigible."
 "Who, me?"
 She leaned back to smile up at him.

For a while I tried to ignore all of the poorly disguised gushing about how brave Alec was, or attempts by the guys to recreate exactly what Alec would've done if Vincent had gone ahead and thrown a punch.
 After fifteen minutes I finally gave up, closed my book and flipped open my notebook.
 Our physics class was about the most sedate, nerdy group of people I'd yet met.
 If they were this worked up about the fight, it was a good thing I didn't share any other classes with Alec.
 The rest of the school must be three or four times as bad.
 Sketching helped block out all of the inane conversation that'd taken over the other corner of the room.
 It was amazing how easily I was able to zone out while drawing.
 Once again, I didn't try to guide my hand, just let my subconscious create a horizon and start fleshing out a body of water and droopy trees around it.
 The sound of a hand coming down hard on a desk pulled me from my refuge.
 "I told you all to keep it to a dull roar.

I remember most of it, though I can‚Äôt recall the tone of her writings, whether she was happy in the beginning.
 My father‚Äôs indiscretion was no secret.
 The entire kingdom knew of his notorious action, stealing a light elf for his bride, though the stories vary.
 Some insist he was overtaken by love and she came willingly.
 Others that he raided her village and took her in the night.
 A servant once told me he heard of her extraordinary powers and beauty and sought her out, bargaining with her parents.
 I scoffed at that.
 What kind of person would trade their child?
 But now that I am older, I see.
 I see what power and greed can become.

 Because of you.

 Harruq‚Äôs anger and frustration simmered and swirled in a dying fire.
 He could not argue with her, not about that.
 Even he could see what she had sacrificed to save his life.
 ‚ÄúWhere do we go?‚Äù he asked, his voice revealing his defeat.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll figure it out in the morning.

 They turned in opposite directions, each disappearing behind the trees and rocks that strewed the mountain, as I stood alone and confused.
 I sat, shaking my head as I stared down at the bark of the tree.
 Chevelle returned quickly with two small, furred animals slung over his back.
 As his gaze reached the log that lay in front of me, it burst into an orange flame, thin branches forming a spit as he skinned and attached the animals.

 He squeezed the back of his chair, refusing to look at her.
 "Yesterday morning, after you went up to your room, I sat in the garden thinking about what your life in 1927 was like."
 His arms began to tremble.
 "I suddenly realized, when I looked out into the garden, that it was 1927."

In the least developed countries, foreign aid has declined by 24 per cent but this has been offset by a 29-fold increase in foreign investment, so that the combination of foreign aid and foreign investment as a percentage of GDP has remained constant.
 If the rich countries, particularly USA, had met the UN development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of GDP, progress in improving the human condition in countries characterized by a high incidence of poverty would have been faster.
 These real and significant gains have been offset and to a large extent obscured in our minds by the persistence and aggravation of problems that constitute the other side of the post-Cold War ledger.
 Far from vanishing, the nuclear danger has been aggravated by the continued proliferation of nuclear weapons, the increasing danger of these weapons falling into the hands of terrorists, and the stubborn refusal of the existing nuclear powers to seize the opportunity to totally eradicate this pernicious arsenal of self-annihilation.
 Reduced confrontation between nation states has been followed by an aggravation of internal conflicts within countries as well as a dramatic increase in threats of violence by disenchanted minorities.
 Violent local conflicts continue to flare around the world.
 Terrorist acts have intensified against civilian populations on every continent.
 While the worst fears about rising unemployment in the West have been dispelled, the challenge of generating sufficient employment opportunities for all people around the world remains a pressing concern.
 The rich-poor divide has increased within and between nations.
 Inadequate job/livelihood opportunities resulting in inadequate purchasing power have now become the most important cause of endemic and hidden hunger.

 but there was nothing else to say.
 Swallowing, she squeezed his hand and turned away.
 As she walked into the garden, she was tempted to turn and look back.
 But that would just heighten their pain.
 With tears running down her cheeks, she quickened her steps.
 Rick watched her disappear into the fog.
 Closing his eyes, he forced himself to think about 1927.
 He pictured Marie calling out for her mother, running into her arms, crying with joy at the reunion.

I felt Alec's grasp tighten slightly, but considering the crushing strength he was capable of, it was the closest thing imaginable to a non-response.
 Brandon was coming up behind Vincent, as Alec reached up and placed his own hand on Vincent's chest, with another, stronger flash of power.
 The ripple of skin and bone was so quick for a second I couldn't believe what I was seeing, but there it was.
 Alec's hand and fingers had elongated, turning into a hairless replica of the deadly claw that'd terrified me just a few days before.
 Vincent's bulk was such that it screened Alec's movements from passersby, as those razor-sharp claws sank just the barest distance into his chest.
 Alec spoke for the first time, and the even tone of his words was a stark contrast to the winds of power that seemed almost ready to throw me across the hall.
 "You forget yourself, mutt.
 As the leader of another pack, I'm due more respect than that.
 Should you or your dominant wish to push things further, I guarantee that your heart will decorate the floor before he can come to your aid."
 Brandon stopped moving as Alec's words carried to him.

‚ÄúQurrah!‚Äù Harruq shrieked, racing to his brother.
 Qurrah shoved away his clumsy attempts to examine the wound.
 ‚ÄúKill him for me,‚Äù the necromancer gasped.
 ‚ÄúGo!
 He cannot live!‚Äù
 ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre bleeding real bad and‚Ä¶‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI have the healing potions, now go!‚Äù
 Harruq‚Äôs gut screamed against the idea, but in the end, he listened to his brother.
 He drew his swords and gave chase.
 Qurrah waited until Harruq was around the corner before taking out one of his small glass vials.

Buddy listened to Lorelei, we know that, for better or worse.
 Let‚Äôs hearken back to a happier image.
 A small recording studio.
 A three-piece band, occasionally four when Jim Dickinson stops by and plays a little keyboards.
 A 20X20 room covered in egg-cartons.
 The preternatural silence beforehand.
 The prelude.
 The creation of something new.
 From where there was nothing something now exists: songs, recordings, an album.
 The making of Turntable Poison was a liminal time, a time of congruity, or grand passion.

The pain was easier to manage knowing that at least he was still in the running for the tournament championship.
 Imeralda stepped into his sight shaking her head, ‚ÄúYou men are crazy sometimes; you actually look pleased!
 If your armor had not held you would be dead now.
 And it is not like you are fighting someone who deserves to die.
 Most of these men are honorable warriors.‚Äù Rodregas nodded.
 ‚ÄúTrue, hopefully another day of this though and we will be back to fighting those we should be fighting, and it will be far harder to stop me if I achieve a greater sigil.‚Äù Imeralda crouched down, she had a very serious expression on her face, and Rodregas had a sense that he was not going to like what she said next.
 ‚ÄúRodregas,‚Äù she said slowly, ‚Äúwe are not doing this for vanity right?‚Äù Rodregas nodded, he sensed she knew the answer to the question but was going somewhere with the question.
 She looked around to make sure others in the arena could not overhear.
 ‚ÄúWe attacked a slave caravan simply because there were children and innocents that needed rescuing though the odds were against us.‚Äù Rodregas nodded again.
 ‚ÄúOn the way here I passed the healers tent,‚Äù she continued.

I want to spend my life with you.
 But I have to go home."
 "I'll never love another woman the way I love you.
 I can't even imagine how I'm going to deal with the void you're about to create."
 Tears sparkled in her eyes.
 "I'm sorry."
 "I know."
 He kissed her then, slowly, sweetly, longingly, trying to memorize the taste and feel of her mouth.
 He wanted to deepen the kiss, to evoke the passion he knew only too well that she was capable of, but such a kiss would be torture for both of them.
 Marie at last ended the kiss.

‚ÄúHe mentioned Ravenhurr as a concern.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut, he simply went mad.
 That is not uncommon,‚Äù she said with a voice laced with surprise.

 I am not sure if you ever met him, but he was good, very good.‚Äù ‚ÄúThen in that case we had better all keep our eyes open.‚Äù She said.
 CHAPTER 7 A TIME TO PREPARE
 Rodregas woke up first, at dawn.
 He stayed in his bed just thinking and reviewing all that he had gone through in the last few days; it was a lot to adjust to.
 When the others got up they ate some of the supplies, including the last of the fresh bread.
 They had plenty of cheese and, at the moment, an endless supply of apples.
 Rodregas had an idea about how he wanted to start this new day.

China created 101 million jobs between 1985 and 1991, 70 per cent in ‚Äòtownship and village enterprises‚Äô, of which nearly half are privately owned.
 In many countries, a large proportion of small enterprises are established by women and employ predominately women.
 An appropriate mix of policies focusing on access to technology, training, credit, marketing and distribution channels can substantially accelerate self-employment, particularly in the informal sector and rural areas, and among women.
 Expand services
 The service sector represents only 25 per cent of the labour force in developing countries compared with more than 67 per cent in the industrial nations.
 Contrary to common conception, services can be a major contributor to job growth even in countries at earlier stages of development.
 This sector is as amenable to stimulation by government policies as agriculture or manufacturing, and it also provides impetus for the growth of other sectors.
 Supportive policies have enabled trade, transport and other services to generate more than 50 per cent of all jobs in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.
 Services have produced more than half of all job growth in many other Asian nations, including private day-care centres, nursery schools and computer training institutes, which are multiplying rapidly in many countries, but can be expanded much further.
 India has adopted an innovative, low-cost, self-employment strategy to expand availability of long-distance telecommunications services by setting up small private telephone and fax centres throughout the country.

Is Hollywood still like that?"
 "Well, there are still movies and lovers and excitement, but I wouldn't call it romantic."
 "Why not?"
 "Everyone takes drugs and gets drunk and has affairs."
 "Oh."
 She looked so chagrined that he regretted having spoiled her illusions.
 "Hey, don't look so sad."
 His thumb stroked her cheek.
 "If you were going to be around for a while, I'd find someplace exciting to take you."
 She smiled then.

I breathed deep.
 It seemed to be helping, so I closed my eyes and relaxed.
 The water started to chill several times, but I was hesitant to get out.
 At the risk of boiling myself, I eased the magic I‚Äôd been using to reheat the bath.
 Finally, I felt well enough to stand.
 I picked up one of the soaps and washed quickly, then pulled the water from the tub to rinse the suds away.
 I‚Äôd not had much opportunity to practice with water; I added it to the list of things to work on.
 It had been a long journey, and the bath was refreshing.
 The soap left a light fragrance in the air, smelling like morning and cold, and I wondered if the fairy dust was still affecting me.
 I dried off and dressed in the clothes Ruby had put out for me.

 Jim ‚Äì Oh, I thought we had gone over this before.
 Johnny ‚Äì Not that I recall.

 Jim ‚Äì His two super-powers are his wondrous ability to bull-shit and the propensity not to be bothered by being completely embarrassed when he gets himself into extremely awkward and stupid situations.

‚ÄúYou were in my dream too.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere was a voice calling my name,‚Äù I said, remembering the creepy dream.
 ‚ÄúIt was saying to beware of the shadows.
 Then I saw this ghost-like girl before I saw you.
 Then I woke up.‚Äù Seth nodded.
 ‚ÄúMine was calling my name too and said to beware of the shadows.
 But I saw a ghost-like boy instead.
 Then I saw a glimpse of you and then I woke up.‚Äù ‚ÄúWho do you think they were?‚Äù I asked.
 ‚ÄúThe ghost kids.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don't know but I have a feeling that they weren't on Kojas' side,‚Äù he replied.
 I glanced over at Emily and Jason, making sure they were still sleeping.
 ‚ÄúWhy do you think they were in our dreams?

 She gave him the same shy smile that had accompanied her request to see a picture.
 "Could we have some hot cocoa?"
 "Sure."
 "Heated in the microwave oven?"
 He laughed.
 "Yeah."
 She began yawning as she finished her chocolate.

He was scowling a little again, which almost made me get out without saying anything.
 My thanks received only a nod in return, and then Rachel was waving goodbye as they backed down the lane.
 The Jeep was gone, of course.
 I wiped away the beginnings of perspiration as I climbed our steps.
 It was still hot enough outside that I knew it was going to be miserable inside.
 By the time I reached the door I was contemplating just finding a decent tree and spending the afternoon outside.
 The sight of a white envelope, barely visible against the off-white door, was enough to drive those thoughts out of my head.
 It had my name on the side that'd been facing the door.
 I pulled it down as I walked inside the house.
 Mom was gone, there wasn't any reason I couldn't read whatever was in the envelope in the living room, but I found myself quickly climbing up our creaky stairs and closing my bedroom door behind me.

A sandlot diamond behind the house where I got a splinter once in my rear.
 The bigger boys laughed.
 A street of gravel with ditches for drainage: Eighth Street.
 And a cocker spaniel bitch named Cyrano.
 Born with eyes the color of the sea, green and mud, a dull roiling behind a semitranslucent screen.
 Born in a matter of minutes, so fast the nurses were dubious, the doctor almost late.
 The town was Lewiston, New York, a carbuncle on the gritty side of gritty Niagara Falls, New York, the former honeymoon capital of the United States, a country which, like Niagara Falls in microcosm, had lately fallen into disrepair.
 Now, Niagara Falls, Ontario, just over the national border, where my mother's incredibly large family hailed from, was bright and brisk and clean and gardeny, the shiny flipside of its American counterpart.
 I‚Äôve seen the great falls frozen; I‚Äôve seen it turned off as if there were a giant tap.
 I‚Äôve stood on a rocking boat deck beneath its monstrous incontestableness.

Everything I'd seen substantiated Brandon's explanation, but why would Jasmin become so enamored of someone so average-looking?
 Not only that, what were the odds Ben was one of the eight males in America who would decide they weren't interested in dating the most gorgeous girl on the planet, even if she was a nut case?
 I was still trying to sort out all the pieces when Brandon fished his cell phone out of a pocket and checked the time.
 In an amazing display of herd behavior, thirty seconds later his friends had all disappeared, and he was standing to leave.
 "We should do this more often.
 I'll see you tomorrow."
 The words were innocent enough, but there was something in his eyes that made a rush of warmth shoot through me.
 Britney was so excited she could hardly speak, but I was too excited myself to feel very superior.
 I floated through my next class, and would've gone through the rest of the day the same way, if I hadn't had to share a class with Alec.
 Still, I was so happy that even Alec's giving me the cold shoulder didn't completely sour my day.

They were staying in a small village that seemed to be mostly a forest with small rooms built into it.
 Rodregas could not figure out any set pattern to the place or its boundaries.
 There might have been a dozen or even hundreds of Nymphs living there.
 Though all the Nymphs were friendly, he was still eager to leave.
 Jordaan was doing one of his mystic checks, running his hand a foot above Rodregas‚Äô reclining body.
 Occasionally, his hand seemed to be moving in the air like a baker making bread.
 ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Rodregas finally said, ‚ÄúI feel fine now and I thank you for your healing, but I think I am ready to leave.‚Äù Jordaan nodded.
 His face held his usual expression of good cheer.
 ‚ÄúYour body heals fast and is a fascinating medium to work with.‚Äù A cloud went over his smile when he added, ‚ÄúYour body and spirit were not in very good alignment and your connection to the world was terribly fractured.
 Truly, it has been more effort to fix your spiritual wounds than your physical ones.‚Äù Jordaan‚Äôs smile returned when he added, ‚ÄúWhile true healing takes a lifetime of both inner and outer work, you are physically healthy enough to be on your way.

Harruq paused, and deep in his heart, some piece of him shrieked in protest.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù he said.
 Salvation and Condemnation quivered in his hands.
 ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no room for compassion.
 Not here.
 Not tonight.‚Äù
 He left the house, blood covering his blades.
 He let out a primal cry to the stars, whether of anguish or elation, he did not know.

It‚Äôs weird, that‚Äôs the most Memphis song on the LP, though it really is about, what‚Äôs inside us, you know?
 What keeps us going, keeps us growing.
 And, it‚Äôs not true unless it makes you laugh.
 That‚Äôs what I want to say to my critics, you know, lighten up, irony isn‚Äôt dead yet.
 Well, I don‚Äôt really want to say it to them, I mean, they‚Äôve got their lives, their maggoty little lives, and they‚Äôve got these things they want to say and I say, god bless them.
 But, in the end, fuck ‚Äòem if they can‚Äôt take a joke.
 But, back to the song, here are the elements present in between the lines: candlelight, a picture of Tristan Tzara that was on Lor‚Äôs wall, post-orgasmic lassitude, the sound a needle makes stuck in the endgrooves of an LP, and, finally and most importunately, the sight of my woman‚Äôs incredible ass, naked beside me.
 That‚Äôs that song.
 I wanted a starker arrangement but Pete talked me into the chick singers and the spoon harp.
 It‚Äôs ok, at least it was subtle.

Two common, but pervasive, myths have gained ground that add an aura of scientific determinism to the fatalism regarding rising un employment: the first relates to technology, the second to trade.
 The notion that science and technology will eventually eliminate the need and, consequently, the opportunity for human productive labour has been gaining ground since the early years of the Industrial Revolution, and, with the advent of automated production lines, computers and industrial robots, it has attained the status of accepted truth.
 Each generation welcomes with foreboding the advent of new technologies, attracted by their potential benefits and frightened by the immediate costs they impose.
 But contrary to popular conception and empirical observation, there is little evidence to support the thesis that technological development is responsible for rising levels of unemployment in the medium to long term.
 In spite of widespread anxiety that machines are progressively replacing people in the workforce, historically there has been a strong positive correlation between technological development and job creation.
 It is certainly the case that the commercial application of each new phase of productive technologies displaces people from traditional occupations, reduces the number of workers required to carry out specific tasks, and can in the short term lead to fewer jobs in specific industries.
 In the process, a larger number of low-wage, unskilled jobs are replaced with a smaller number of higher-wage, more skilled jobs resulting in rising levels of worker productivity and rising personal incomes.
 But that is only the most direct initial impact of improved technology.
 Seen from a wider perspective and traced patiently along the course of its myriad consequences, the introduction of new technology acts as a catalyst that generates a positive ripple effect which, on average, results in the creation of many more jobs ‚Äì more skilled, more productive and higher-wage jobs ‚Äì than it destroys.
 The rising productivity made possible by technology reduces production costs and thereby lowers the price of products and services to customers and consumers.

He knelt down, his blades falling from his limp hands.
 He pulled away Aurelia‚Äôs hand to see the blood, to see the wound.

 Aurelia tried to say something, tried to comfort him, but no noise came from her throat.
 She was dying.
 ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Harruq shouted.
 He pulled out one of his healing potions, yanked off the cork, and forced the contents down Aurelia‚Äôs throat.
 The elf gagged, retching up half of it onto her neck and chest.

 Good night, good night, good night.
 When it‚Äôs time to go to bed And yucky thoughts are in my head, I quickly start to sing, Jesus, in the night you are my nightlight.

Go ahead, young man--we can put business off for a few hours."
 Marie hung onto Davis' arm as they walked out to his automobile.
 "Thank you for taking me.
 I haven't seen you since Tuesday!"
 "And you've missed me?"
 "Terribly."
 Her heart flipped over as he kissed her hand.
 He drove her to Boston‚Äôs finest dress shop, sitting down to smoke and read the newspaper as she tried on clothes.
 "What do you think?"
 she asked, turning slowly in front of him.

‚ÄúAm I interrupting something?‚Äù Emily asked with a gulp.
 The faery men drew their double swords and charged at her.
 I released an arrow and it buried itself in one of their necks.
 It fell backward and they turned to my hiding spot, searching for me.
 Two knives flew and a dwarf and man collapsed on the ground.
 I saw Jason hide behind his tree again.
 One dwarf got too close to Emily and she raised her arms, dousing him in flames.
 He screeched and fell to the ground, withering and then went still.
 Seth ran from the trees, brandishing his sword.
 He swung it around and clashed with one of the faery's swords.

 Greg:  Is this the twilight zone or something?
 I wish I would have watched that show more often, then I would know what to do now.
 God why couldn‚Äôt I have been more forward thinking?
 Why did I have to waste all that time watching car racing when I could have been preparing?
 Why was I so blind?
 (Gets up and stumbles off stage)
 Cindy is waiting for the bus.

On occasion, my mother would take us to the store to visit her on her break.
 We would run from aisle to aisle searching for her brightly colored smock.
 One of the few times I ever remember eating out was when we shared her lunch break and ate hot dogs and popcorn at the department store cafeteria.
 I still think of Grandma whenever I walk into a discount store and smell the snack bar.
 We lived with our grandparents longer than we should have, but my mother had little choice.
 My mother, still young and very attractive, was saddled with the responsibility of two young boys who knew nothing about her predicament.
 She made sure we never felt like we were a burden, but as I look back I know it must have been so difficult for her.
 She never complained and we always felt her love.
 She worked as a carhop at a Bob‚Äôs Big Boy hamburger joint and she wore roller skates to serve the drive up customers in their cars.
 My Uncle Dan would take us there at night to visit her and she could sometimes sneak us some food.

And she was this novelist‚Äôs daughter and so she was cool and kind of bohemian and had this apartment in Midtown, upper floor, with a nice view of Poplar.
 So, I just showed up there one evening.
 And, you won‚Äôt believe this, but she was just out of the shower and was wearing nothing but a bathrobe.
 And her skin was glistening with dampness.
 I thought I had stumbled into heaven, man.
 I thought, nothing is gonna be easier than falling into bed with this beautiful woman.
 So, after some awkward small talk‚Äîand keep in mind, she didn‚Äôt go get dressed‚ÄîI made a move.
 I think I just sort of leaned in to kiss her.
 And she let me kiss her, but, man, nothing back.
 I mean, fuck, she didn‚Äôt even open her mouth.

I didn't have a ride home until Britney finished up her regular studying stint.
 "For Britney?
 Do you want us to give you a ride home?"
 A slight movement, barely seen out of the corner of my eye, gave meaning to the last part of the sentence.
 A familiar-looking guy was standing a few feet from Rachel.
 I couldn't place him.
 I slowly shook my head, trying to jar something loose enough to figure out who he was.
 "Please, Adriana.
 It really isn't any trouble.
 James, can you get your car, please?"

I hurried forward, sure I was about to lose both her and the route.
 When I topped the rock, I froze, taking a heartbeat too long to drop to my stomach.
 Just over that ridge stood a group of elves, though after my pulse settled, I didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd seen me before I‚Äôd fallen back.
 I wasn‚Äôt quite close enough to hear, but didn‚Äôt see a better vantage point.
 I squinted, examining the figures.
 Ruby‚Äôs red curls gave her away.
 She had tossed back the hood of her cloak and was laughing with a large elf.
 Steed, I was almost sure because of his stance.
 I scanned the darkness and found two other figures.
 One was about the size of Steed; the other was thinner and appeared fidgety, even in the darkness.

"That's-that's the style."
 "And this is considered comfortable?
 I don't know if I can even sit down with them on!"
 With regret he put his own wishes aside.
 "Is that the bigger pair?
 If not, let's get some bigger ones."
 "No--these are the small ones.
 I'll go try the others."
 They bought the bigger pair and two shirts, and Marie wore the jeans and the red and navy shirt from the store.
 "Thank you for the clothes, Rick," she said, smiling up at him.

‚ÄúI'm sorry Jason...but you were such a grouch yesterday...we had to get you back!‚Äù ‚ÄúI will get you back,‚Äù Jason said angrily.
 ‚ÄúI will.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay Jason,‚Äù I hiccupped.
 ‚ÄúBut you're going to have to wait a while.‚Äù ‚ÄúDude that was hilarious,‚Äù Seth choked out and had a smile on his face the size of the cave.
 ‚ÄúI'm surprised you didn't scream like a little girl.
 But you did jump like one.‚Äù Jason's face went red.
 ‚ÄúI thought I'd get some support from you, Seth.‚Äù He crossed his arms.
 ‚ÄúYou might be next, you know.‚Äù Seth shrugged.
 ‚ÄúMaybe, but I don't care.
 We all need a good laugh to keep our spirits up and if that means scaring the crap out of me, I'm fine with it.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo you'll be fine with me dragging you outside while you were sleeping and leaving you in the rain?‚Äù Emily asked.
 Seth narrowed his eyes.

Harruq drew his swords, and then they sparred.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre out later than normal,‚Äù Qurrah said when Harruq returned to their home.
 ‚ÄúI get restless stuck in here,‚Äù he said.
 He dropped his weapons in the corner, shed much of his leather armor, and then released a loud groan as he settled down.
 ‚ÄúHarruq, I must ask a favor of you,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 He sat next to his brother.
 ‚ÄúSure thing,‚Äù Harruq said.

I warned you that you must be prepared for anything.‚Äù ‚ÄúSeth,‚Äù I said slowly, placing a hand on his shoulder, ‚ÄúDon't attack him, we need him to help us get through Igneeria.‚Äù I felt his shoulder muscle tense under my fingers but he lowered his blade.
 He didn't sheath it though, because he would need it in the fight.
 He glowered at the dwarf, ‚ÄúDon't think that I trust you, dwarf,‚Äù he said angrily.
 ‚ÄúYou're only alive because Jazell makes a good point.
 But if I find that you are lying to us,‚Äù he sliced the air, ‚ÄúYou're going to have a lot more problems than you think.‚Äù The dwarf gulped and looked away.
 I gripped Seth's shoulder and he turned around to face me.
 I saw distrust flash in his eyes but he gave me a weak smile.
 We turned to face the monsters heading for us.
 Seth charged ahead, slicing Thrashers and Frost Beasts.
 I notched an arrow and released it.

One swung his sword in a high, round arc while the other stabbed forward, hoping to gut the half-orc because of his charge.
 Harruq‚Äôs charge, though, was far from mindless.
 His speed far beyond the guard‚Äôs, he knocked the stab away, then shifted his weight so that both Salvation and Condemnation blocked the other attack.
 The weaker blade shattered against the magic of the twin swords.
 One weaponless and the other horribly positioned, the two were defenseless.
 Salvation took a throat.
 Condemnation pierced rib and lung.
 Harruq ripped his blade out of the guard‚Äôs chest and shoved the body to the side.
 The dying heap of flesh collided against two other men, knocking them back and delaying their attack.
 He mocked them, adrenaline flooding his veins.

I barely took notice of her expression, her tight grin and suspicious eyes as she took in my mud-streaked clothes, dripping hair.
 I didn‚Äôt speak; I was spent and I just couldn‚Äôt make myself care.
 In the dark of my room, I collapsed onto the bed, dropping asleep to the thrum of falling rain.
 I woke gasping from another dream of my mother and destruction.
 The rain had stopped, and the sun was rising, so I wiped the sweat from my brow and went to the hall pitcher to splash my face.
 The dark roots of my hair were stark in the mirror‚Äôs reflection, and I recalled the dream.
 The memories of my mother were fuzzy, but I‚Äôd always thought she‚Äôd had light hair, beautiful and golden like Junnie‚Äôs.
 In the dreams, it was black‚Ä¶ as black as the roots of my hair were now.
 I stood there for a long moment, staring at the darkness, and then spun as I made another stupid, rash decision.
 Slinking past Fannie‚Äôs room, I headed for her makeshift vault.

We were vagabonds, back then.
 When Darcy was two months old we moved to Iowa for my gradual school (for a definition of "gradual" see or read The World According to Garp, by John Irving who was my first professor there).
 When Cody was two months old, we moved to Arizona for a teaching job I was offered.
 Two years later, we moved to Chico, California for a job with more security, which we craved on account of the little ones.
 But security only exists as a craving.
 Even though the college in Chico gave me tenure, so they couldn‚Äôt have fired me unless I kidnapped the president or his wife or daughter, I had to leave it behind because Laura and I split apart and my kids, whom I loved more than life, health, art or anything, went to live in San Diego.
 I tried commuting (1000 mile weekend trips) for a while but, feeling what I imagine was a similar emptiness to that of Mexicans who labor up here for their families in Mexico, I chucked the best job I‚Äôll probably ever have and returned to San Diego.
 In those first years back, the times I lived for were coaching Cody and the team during practices and ball games at Kuhlken Field, home of La Mesa National Little League.
 Named after my dad since he had been president and organized the renovation of the field.
 During our games, pulling for Cody, I came to understand why a father I knew dropped dead in the stands, when his heart failed while his son was pitching.

We went to the ridge with the others, but we didn‚Äôt train.
 In fact, I was fairly certain Ruby and Chevelle were avoiding me.
 I waited through the morning and finally‚Äîaround midday‚ÄîI gave up and relaxed onto the ground, staring up at the sky.
 The earth beneath me was warm, the sun shining bright.
 I watched as a bird flew high overhead.
 It was gliding, slow and steady on the wind.
 As I shielded my eyes with a hand, I noticed the ink on my wrist and smiled.
 I suddenly knew the soaring creature above was a hawk.
 I closed my eyes and relaxed my arm at my side, imagining flying.
 I breathed deep and conjured the image it would see, looking down on us.

Looks like I wasn‚Äôt sleeping after all.
 Chapter 3
 Sneaking out after hours isn‚Äôt easy, especially at Emily‚Äôs house.
 Her parents aren‚Äôt sound sleepers.
 If we weren‚Äôt really careful, they‚Äôd wake up and then we‚Äôd have some answering to do.
 And I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd understand our reason.
 I followed Emily down the stairs, in our pajamas, to the door.
 We were careful not to make a sound but I listened closely to the sound of her dad snoring.
 When the snore rang clearly through the house, I breathed a sigh of relief.
 We threw on our sneakers and snuck out the door.

I have tried, on this trip, to relive our whole two years of brotherhood.
 And now I reconsider the fact that he didn‚Äôt die the moment his head rammed the boulder.
 He lived for a day, during which we got confronted with the possibility that drove my story ‚ÄúCars‚Äù, that he might live another sixty years without the use of his marvelous brain.
 Or, a miracle might bring him back to life.
 A whole new question arises.
 What if, while Eric lay comatose, he was given once more the choice to live, as I'm coming to believe he was given the choice before leaving for the desert in Kenny‚Äôs mom‚Äôs Volkswagen?
 If Kenny were still alive, I would ask him to describe, as best his memory would serve him, Eric‚Äôs expression and voice when he insisted they leave without Billy and me.
 The Bible implies that Jesus, had he been a less than perfect, could have chosen another fate than crucifixion.
 Only he chose trust his father‚Äôs will above his own, which was limited by his humanity, as ours is, in spades.
 Maybe twice, at least, Eric chose to die for me.

I notched an arrow and aimed.
 Dust kicked up everywhere as I aimed blindly.
 I heard one of them shout out in pain.
 I shot another and another, anger burning through me.
 Stop him.
 I turned around and saw Seth‚Äôs body through the dust.
 He looked up at me and mouthed, Jazell.
 ‚ÄúSeth!‚Äù I yelled.
 Then the dust and darkness swallowed him up until I couldn‚Äôt see him at all.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù Harruq muttered.
 He shivered as a skull sailed just above them, its screech turning to chaotic laughter.
 The sound raced up and down his spine, triggering fear no matter how irrational.
 Qurrah watched as if immune to the sound.
 He was so much smaller than Harruq, his slender body wrapped in rags, thin flesh clinging to bone.
 Yet he was unafraid.
 Shame and embarrassment burned in Harruq‚Äôs cheeks.
 He towered over his brother, his hands beefy and arms muscular.
 Nothing should scare him.
 He was supposed to be Qurrah‚Äôs protector, not the other way around.

One reason I would rather seek the beautiful than the good is because I can know with more confidence when I have encountered it.
 When I first read the John Keats poem, ‚ÄúOde on a Grecian Urn‚Äù I got both enthralled and challenged by the lines ‚ÄúBeauty is truth, truth beauty.
 That is all we know on earth and all we need to know.‚Äù I believe those words are inspired, expressing deep though mysterious wisdom.
 Bible translators may avoid the word "beauty" because too many readers might interpret in ways akin to the ‚Äô60s motto, ‚ÄúIf it feels good, do it.‚Äù In my vocabulary, "beautiful" describes a harmony that suggests the eternal.
 Such beauty may harbor sadness, or even a terrifying dread.
 It speaks to us of what Robert Pirsig, in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance terms Quality, and which he proposes as the principle in charge of the cosmos.
 I read somewhere that Dostoyevski once asserted: even if he knew for a fact God didn‚Äôt exist, he would continue to believe.
 If he did make that apparently loco remark, I would bet he was trying to express the beauty to which communion with God can lead us.
 Like today, when I find myself delivered far beyond the ordinary, into a realm where the glory of simple hills and pastures, of cows and bluebirds, is such that I know why the prophets described heaven as jeweled and paved in gold.
 Father Zossima in The Brothers Karamazov relates this kind of beauty.

Substantive measures are needed to strengthen the UN‚Äôs capabilities to handle crises.
 First and foremost, the position of the Secretary General, who now has the diplomatic status equal to that of a prime minister of a member state, should be upgraded to that of a head of state, with full authority over the forces placed under his command by member states to carry out the decisions of the Security Council.
 Problems of control over the armed forces of member states argue for the constitution of a standing international military force, as described in the previous section of this report.
 Lesser measures can be implemented immediately, such as provision of appropriate training to UN Secretariat personnel responsible for conflict prevention, expanding the staff of the Department of Political Affairs, and establishment by the UN of its own independent international surveillance capability, including a satellite system to monitor its work worldwide.
 Meanwhile, advanced computer, satellite and communications technology should be made available to the Secretariat by member states.
 A comprehensive system is needed to monitor military movements.
 Through its resident representatives, the UN should openly monitor political, ethnic, nationalist and religious developments that increasingly lie at the heart of conflicts in order to understand the complexities of local events and to anticipate potential turbulence.
 The right to sovereignty should not include the freedom to privacy in cases which involve support for terrorist groups, instigating border conflicts, arms build-ups, torture and genocide.
 In addition to the role of the UN in consensus fact-finding, it must also acquire the jurisdiction to order fact-finding missions relating to both domestic and regional conflicts in which this type of violation is suspected.
 Cessation of violence and conflict settlement often leave unresolved the root causes of conflict, resulting in potential for renewed fighting or social turbulence.

he asked after they'd sat down and begun eating.
 "Mmm."
 She swallowed and licked her lips.
 "This is heavenly.
 Would you like a bite?"
 "No thank you.
 But try some of this.
 See if it's as good as the chocolate."
 She let him feed her a bite.
 "It's good," she decided, "but it can't compare with chocolate."

"Thank you for the clothes, Rick," she said, smiling up at him.
 "You're welcome.
 Do you like them?"
 "Very much."
 She sighed.
 "But I suppose I shouldn't take them back with me."
 "Why?"
 "I could never wear the trousers."
 She laughed softly.

 She swallowed, concentrating on trying to get her heart under control.

 I-I‚Äôm really going to just walk back into 1927, just go back the way I came.
 We‚Äôve been doing it right all along‚Äîexcept that you had to be the one thinking about my home.‚Äù "Yeah."
 Marie stared at him, her eyes widening in disbelief.

 Her face turned red at the thought.

 She shivered.
 She would give anything to be able to make love with Rick.

‚ÄúVery well,‚Äù Harruq said, drawing his swords in his gigantic arms.
 ‚ÄúGuess you need a reminder of who you‚Äôre learning from.‚Äù He lowered his weapons and thrust out his chest.

 Two free hits.

 Aurelia eyed him, obviously insulted.
 She gave him two quick raps across the chest.
 ‚ÄúTwo to zero,‚Äù she said before dancing away.
 Harruq raised his swords and roared.

 ‚ÄúHarruq Tun,‚Äù Velixar said suddenly, jolting him from his drifting thoughts.
 ‚ÄúYes, master?‚Äù he asked, rising and straightening his back.
 He could feel the eyes of his brother on him and did not wish to disappoint.
 ‚ÄúQurrah has told me of the troubles in your heart.
 I must see them.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúHe did?‚Äù Harruq asked, glancing at his brother.

Inspired by the fine drops that shot out, she pointed the nozzle straight into the air.
 "Rain!"
 "Hey!"
 Rick backed out of the spray.
 Laughing, Marie pointed the water at him.
 "Have a drink!"
 "Marie!"
 He tried to run away, but she chased him.
 Thoroughly soaked, he changed tactics and ran toward her.
 She screeched and started to run, but he seized her around the waist and grabbed the hose.

BG: 	Lately, for whatever reasons, I have been thinking more about the spiritual side of the human animal than ever I have in my previous twenty-some year tenure on Spaceship Earth.
 It probably has to do with getting older, finding my stability in Lor.
 Time at least to take a peak into the spiritual caldron.
 There are miracles, it might cause one to whisper, alone in the dark.
 I‚Äôm not comfortable, really, man, talking about my numinous side, as interesting as I think that is.
 I want to ask a lot of questions, without presuming there are always answers.
 Like, where do lares and penates, where does religion, fit in with this cynical lifestyle we‚Äôve adopted, or that we‚Äôve carefully constructed?
 As The Lovin‚Äô Spoonful asked, ‚ÄúDo you believe in magic?‚Äù I mean, I don‚Äôt know what has caused me to cogitate about the underlying premise of life, you know?.
 I mean, fuck, are we really that far removed from our supranatural sides that any discussion or mention of it is inordinate, is worth commentary?
 Or are we only embarrassed by discussions of spirituality?

She's with my mother."
 My confusion must have been more than usually self-evident as I sat up.
 "No, Mother isn't going through a good episode.
 She's asleep.
 Rachel crept into her room and crawled into bed with her.
 It's a poor substitute for what she aches for, but it's all Mother can offer right now."
 "Alec, there must be something we can do."
 He gently captured my hands, stilling their frantic motion and shook his head.
 "Not right now.
 Rachel cherishes her few remaining illusions.

A detailed study should be conducted under the auspices of the United Nations, OECD or the European Commission to quantify the potential gains or losses to the global economy of rapid or slow progress of the transition in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
 10.Scientific resources: Science has been one of the greatest casualties of the reform programme.
 Severe fiscal constraints have forced governments to reduce drastically budgetary allocations to research institutions, leaving most of these institutions with little or no source of revenues to support their activities.
 High priority must be given to developing a detailed plan for preservation of the scientific research infra structure during the difficult transition period and for restructuring it so that it can be integrated effectively into the emerging market system.
 The drain of talents must be stopped by a concerted national effort to exploit each country's competitive advantage in science by marketing these capabilities internationally, and particularly by linking up with other countries in the region and with developing countries that can most benefit from the region's scientific and technological capabilities.
 Search for a New Model
 Ironically, despite all the international debate about transition, thus far the actual goal of the transition process has never been clearly spelled out.
 It is widely presumed to be to some form of capitalist system, but which variety ‚Äì the Swedish?
 The Japanese?
 The American?

Rodregas knew from the guard‚Äôs fear that he had him, he was not thinking clearly.
 Rodregas growled at him, letting him feel his anger and rage at taking slaves to be used by the Immortalists.
 Rodregas had seen what would happen to them.
 He had suffered for years with a subtle kind of inner rot at letting the evil continue.
 In all the ways that mattered Rodregas knew he was no better than this man, he had spent most of his life as a slaver.
 Rodregas had no moral grounds on which to kill these men, but inside of him there was no mercy.
 He had crossed a line and could no longer live with the evil.
 Rodregas let go of the guard‚Äôs shield.
 He did not have the angle to grab his opponent‚Äôs throat.
 Instead he had to grab the man‚Äôs lower face which was exposed by the half helm, and then he squeezed.

 "No, you're not.

 They're all monsters, but you aren't."
 Alec finally let his eyes fully meet mine.

She embraced him, whispering, "Thank you for everything.
 I'll miss you too."
 She gave him a smile before turning and walking into the garden.
 When she found herself at the edge of it, she veered right, seeing that it extended farther in that direction.
 She deliberately tried to lose herself, since that was how she'd gotten to 2011.
 And she knew that Rick would find her if she didn't get back to 1927.
 It wasn't working.
 She could tell--there wasn't enough fog to hide anything, and she could see that nothing had changed.
 She was still in 2011.

They fed him and they housed him and they educated him.
 He had his ups and downs but he embraced his goal to help others who were afflicted by addiction as he was.
 He started in detox, which was fitting, as it is exactly where he began.
 It was a dirty job that we knew all too well.
 He described how he rubbed the backs of the young men who vomited and comforted them as they reeled in pain from withdrawals.
 He remembered the video of himself and the comparison was obvious.
 From there Brandon went through every stage of the program as an intern instead of a student.
 Brandon even took incoming calls from parents who had children that they were attempting to get into rehab, just as we had called when we were desperate to find our son a place that would help him.
 I have also volunteered my time through Narconon to talk to any parent who calls and wants to talk to another parent who has experienced the nightmare they are living.
 It is hard for me as they tell me their horrific stories of a life we once lived.

 ‚ÄúAnd quiet, before you wake him.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúToo late,‚Äù said a voice from the stairs.
 Both turned to see Ahrqur standing at the top step, his arms crossed.
 He was dressed in a long green robe.
 Silver swirls marked the sleeves and front.
 Brown hair fell far past his shoulders.
 ‚ÄúPleased to meet you,‚Äù Harruq said with a bow.
 ‚ÄúIndeed,‚Äù Qurrah said, his hand itching to retrieve his whip curled underneath his raggedy robe.
 ‚ÄúIf you are thieves, you are certainly incompetent ones,‚Äù Ahrqur said, his voice full of contempt.

Having fun is important in 1927--dancing, music, pictures--all kinds of merriment.
 And my father is wealthy.
 We have enough money to do anything we want.
 But all he wants to do is earn more money.
 When I was 19, we went to a new resort in Palm Beach.
 For months I looked forward to it, but it was a terrible disappointment.
 Father went only because a man with whom he had business was going there for the Christmas holidays.
 And he wouldn't allow me out.
 He's very protective."

Diane said Mother would attend Sunday mass at St. Jude's church at 7 a.m. After a late night at a birthday party up the coast, I staggered from bed to my car and blearily followed Diane's directions.
 St. Jude's is near downtown San Diego, in an old flatland neighborhood of two bedroom homes, vintage Chevrolets so lowered so that sparks fly from underneath, plentiful thrift stores, corner groceries and at least one storefront church on every block.
 Mother Teresa's secret had gotten out.
 People in orange vests directed traffic.
 In the parking lot, vendors sold oranges, onions, tapes and CDs in Spanish.
 I didn't see any Mother Teresa dolls, but I was half asleep.
 At 6:30 the church was crowded, standing room only.
 I found a place against the west wall near the front section, where the seats were reserved for MC sisters in their white saris.
 They are mostly small brown women with eyes so bright, at first glance they could pass for children.
 Up front, across from me was a small choir accompanied by a guitar and electric keyboard.

"Only you could see such beauty and think only of keeping it to yourself.
 Trust me, even with surroundings like this I'd much rather be elsewhere if you're part of the bargain."
 The thought of being elsewhere brought our newest crisis to mind, and I realized that it was very likely I wouldn't have to worry about Britney, Alec, or Brandon for very much longer.
 "At least you won't have to suffer my presence for much longer; we'll be gone all too quickly."
 The fact I was saying these things to Alec when I knew this all had to be a dream was ludicrous, but it wasn't as ludicrous as the way he flinched at my words.
 "No, you're right, all too soon you'll go the way of so many others.
 If I can depend on nothing else, I can rely on that."
 A little eddy of wind found its way into our grotto, and for the first time my newly-acute sense of smell registered Alec's presence.
 His scent was divine, full of subtle themes I wasn't experienced enough to pick out, all of which screamed of warm power and rock-like masculinity.
 For half a second the torrent of sensation was too strong to leave room for conscious thought.

Waffling over whether or not to take the job was one thing when she was sure she'd have it in the end.
 It was entirely different when it might cost her the biggest break she'd ever had.
 She nodded jerkily as she stepped out of the room, already dialing.
 I felt my eyelids drooping by the time she came back.
 "They want me to leave right now.
 She said she's already arranged for a charter plane out of St. George.
 If I leave in the next ten minutes, we can make the flight out of Salt Lake International with something like half an hour to spare."
 We both sat there in silence for a few seconds as everything sank in, and then Mom exploded into motion.
 She ran downstairs to repack her photography equipment, all the while yelling upstairs to verify that I'd packed all of the other essentials she was going to need.
 Almost before I'd even finished assimilating how quickly Alec had pulled everything together, Mom was backing down the lane as I waved goodbye.

Maybe it could've been a painting of Cindi, but not one of me.
 I couldn't possibly be the gorgeous figure he'd brought to life on his canvas.
 I opened my mouth to protest, and then the expression on her face finally registered for me.
 Compassion.
 Acceptance of the viewer, combined with an obvious desire to mend grievous hurts.
 It was exactly how I remembered feeling.
 My questing eyes finally found the last, missing piece.
 There was the gratitude.
 Misplaced on her perfect face.
 Wrong on the features of someone who couldn't possibly need help from a mere mortal, but still there.

 It wasn‚Äôt as if you could get more unoriginal than using the ancient word meaning ‚Äúelf‚Äù, but he certainly hadn‚Äôt needed to follow it with a string of ridiculous, flowery‚ÄîI stopped mid-thought, realizing my tutor was watching me.
 ‚ÄúHey, Junnie,‚Äù I said, forcing a smile.
 ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs on the schedule for today?‚Äù She smiled in return, straightening the deep blue sash that tied her tunic.
 ‚ÄúHow do you feel about studying the lineages?‚Äù She knew I hated trying to memorize endless pages of names and dates, and didn‚Äôt seem surprised by my groan of complaint.
 ‚ÄúWell, let‚Äôs get to it then,‚Äù she said, leading me through the tiny living area toward the back room.
 She didn‚Äôt have or need a great deal of space.
 Much like me, Junnie was practically alone.
 Her family had all received the calling ‚Äúto serve elfkind.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know exactly what that meant, only that the elf usually left with fanfare and seldom returned in fewer than a hundred years.
 It was apparently a very honorable thing, though she never seemed proud.

I showed him a family photo and he identified Thomas as the guy.
 When I searched my house I found liquid Hydrocodone prescribed for horses.
 Thomas had been using my house as his daytime drug den.
 When I confronted him, he denied it, and even went so far as to blame Brandon and Bryce.
 He threw his nephews under the bus to cover his ass.
 Another rift between us.
 I had to protect my boys.
 In their teenage years, Brandon and Bryce were as different as perfect strangers and they were becoming young men.
 As they began to become more independent from me and from each other, they became interested in different things.
 I tried to accommodate them as individuals and stay close to them.

It‚Äôs all sex, right?
 And now I felt like part of the brotherhood.
 I wanted to write more songs‚Äîthat‚Äôs the best part‚ÄîI wanted to create.
 And I wanted more orgasms.
 (laughs) That was freshman year‚ÄîDebbie, she was freshman year.
 And my gigs with my new band.
 Man, everything was happening.
 I started to lose myself when I played, you know, and it was kind of frightening, where I‚Äôd go when I played.
 I wasn‚Äôt even aware of Skippy and Crafty, except as background thunder, a wall I was bouncing off of.
 And, like sex, I was gone, man.

It was simultaneously the scariest and most exciting thing I'd ever experienced.
 Even as I leaned in a little bit myself, my thundering heart seemed to be trying to leap out of my throat solely for the purpose of disrupting what looked very much like it was going to be my first kiss.
 Every tiny hair on my body stood up in a shiver of nervousness as he tilted his head to the side, and then he broke off, shaking himself slightly as he gave me a smile.
 For a second I thought he was rejecting me, that he'd decided not to kiss me because he wasn't interested.
 Only the way he reached out for my hand indicated that he really wasn't repulsed by me.
 It bothered me the entire time I was in History, and then just before I got to Physics it hit me.
 He hadn't stopped because he didn't want to kiss me.
 He stopped because with all of my blushing and near-terror it'd been obvious I wasn't ready to be kissed.
 It was the ultimate act of chivalry.
 I more or less floated through my last two classes.

It sucked a lot more when you didn't have a choice.
 I tried to amuse myself by people-watching with the half of my mind that wasn't paying attention to Britney's chatter as we went back to our lockers.
 We passed one of those gorgeous, skinny redheads who always look good without looking like they spent much time in front of the mirror, then Britney exchanged smiles with a couple of artificial blondes.
 I'd seen the type before in Minnesota, girls who have a perfectly acceptable figure, but who throw money into their wardrobes, makeovers and accessories in an effort to achieve the cutting-edge look, when they'd be much better off just picking outfits that didn't try to compete with the anorexic-looking beauty queens.
 A surprisingly adorable-looking nerd in jeans and a tee-shirt ducked out of our way, and I felt a pang of sympathy.
 He was the kind of boy Mom pointed out when she surfaced from one of her projects.
 She hadn't ever managed to really pique my interest in any boy, but I could see how a few years from now, he'd probably be fairly popular among college girls.
 Britney stopped before one of the top lockers and started spinning the tumbler.
 She was still relating some story about her old school, but suddenly I couldn't hear a word.
 The crowd of students had drifted to the sides of the hall, like worshipers making way for a pair of pagan gods.

He pictured her putting on his t-shirt, holding his handkerchief to her nose, crying as she thought about him.
 He thought about 1927 as long as he could and then remained there, frozen, his mind numb.
 He hoped that he'd been wrong, that he hadn't opened the door to 1927, that any minute now she'd come back to him.
 Finally he looked at his watch.
 It was 11:25.
 It had been 7:45 when they'd come into the garden.
 She was gone.
 CHAPTER THIRTEEN
 Tears were streaming down Marie's cheeks when the fog began to lift.
 She was in her own garden.

Scales that'd been twisted into a mangled mess and then torn into two pieces.
 I'd expected the shallow, narcissistic eyes of a runway model.
 Instead, the eyes that connected with mine hinted at depths I'd never even imagined existed.
 My lips, acting of their own volition, started to pull back in a tentative smile, but before they could complete the action, the heart-wrenching eyes narrowed.
 The emotions swooping across the surreal face were too quick to identify, but the way he turned slightly away as he passed all but proved they'd been a close cousin to distaste.
 Chapter 3 For a moment I was too busy mentally flogging myself to hear Britney's question.
 "Have you been to Vegas yet?"
 "No, we just got here last night."
 And I'd been too busy making doe eyes at gorgeous boys who were completely out of my league to do anything like take a shopping trip.
 Britney perked up at my answer.

The same process of structural transition is repeating itself today and raising the same anxieties.
 Contrary to common belief, the US employment rate, the percentage of total population with jobs, has risen steadily throughout the century from 38 per cent to 46 per cent of the total population and is expected to reach 51 per cent by 2005.
 This trend is true for the industrial nations as a whole.
 Between 1960 and 1992, total employment in OECD countries rose by 110 million jobs or 44 per cent, including a 22 per cent increase in the participation of women in the workforce.
 During this same period, un employment rose by 23 million persons, representing a 259 per cent increase in the overall unemployment rate.
 More people are working than ever before, yet at the same time more people are unemployed, because a larger proportion of the population seek jobs.
 Growing anxiety about employment prospects in the West were aggravated by a sudden 50 per cent increase in unemployment after 1990, which displaced an additional 10 million workers in the OECD and was equalled only by the previous high of 1983.
 This increase is now showing signs of reversal.
 These average figures disguise significant differences in performance of countries within the OECD.
 Since 1950, Japan‚Äôs employment rate has risen from 43 per cent to around 50 per cent, while unemployment has remained in the 1 to 3 per cent range.

I could barely look him in the eyes.
 I attempted every type of magic he could come up with, to no avail.
 I was beyond frustrated.
 Worse, I could tell he was being gentle on purpose, afraid I would break.
 I thought of what he‚Äôd said before, the dangers of messing with the bindings.
 He must have read it on my face.
 ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough for now.
 Rest, Freya.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt argue.
 Ruby came in, as if on cue, and Chevelle excused himself.
 I laid down, but irritation kept me from sleep.

 Already longer than The Crying of Lot 49.
 So, when this comes out, I‚Äôll be vindicated, right, I‚Äôll be made sense of.

 But, hell, why else are we doing this?
 It‚Äôs gotta be a story or people aren‚Äôt gonna read it, aren‚Äôt gonna care.
 It‚Äôs gotta have an arc and that arc has to end with some kind of positive energy, some chi.

 ‚ÄúI would encourage you to be careful on your trip over.
 You did hear about what happened to Ravenhurr?‚Äù asked Taiga.
 Van‚Äôdret almost felt his eye brows rise, ‚Äúof course, but what should I watch out for?
 I heard it was just some sort of accident.
 I was not aware that any of the Knights of the Order were implicated.‚Äù Taiga smiled and waved a hand in a dismissing motion.
 ‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt misjudge my words.
 I did not mean to imply any misdeeds of our valiant Knights of the Soaring Heavens.
 I am not aware of any of them doing much of anything, much less kill an Immortalist.‚Äù ‚ÄúThan what should I keep my eye out for?‚Äù asked Van‚Äôdret.
 He was becoming even more curious to the direction of the conversation.

I wasn‚Äôt allowed any background noise.
 I was parked at the far end of the lot with the front end of my truck against a fence as I was instructed to do.
 I was impatiently waiting when I finally saw one of the scraggly dressed officers wandered by pushing a grocery basket full of bags looking like a homeless person.
 He had an old torn jacket on with a beanie on his head.
 He was unshaven and looked the part of a vagrant.
 We had a moment of eye contact and he had no expression as if he didn‚Äôt know me at all.
 It was a slight reassurance but I still wondered where the rest of them were and how they would get to me quick if things went to Hell.
 I received another call from the officer and he had me speak so they could tune in the wire.
 He said that they needed to occasionally check the wire‚Äîfrom time to time I should say something to reassure them that they‚Äôd end up with a quality recording of the deal.
 The crack-berry rang and it was Ashley.

Most developing countries will have no option but to produce more food and agricultural commodities from less land and water in the twenty-first century.
 The challenge lies in accomplishing this in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner.
 The FAO should launch a co ordinated international effort to extend the principles and strategies of the Green Revolution to eradicate global food shortages within a decade.
 The Green Revolution was originally applied to improving productivity of wheat and rice in high potential areas.
 After the first rounds of phenomenal success, the effort to extend it to other agricultural regions and other crops lost momentum, because the urgent necessity had been eliminated.
 Recognizing the importance of agricultural surplus to rural employment, industrialization and exports, renewed efforts are called for to apply the comprehensive, integrated approach of the Green Revolution to high potential commercial crops and to all regions.
 With the knowledge gained over the past 30 years, greater emphasis can be placed on ensuring that the productivity improvements are not only economically viable but also ecologically sustainable.
 Region-specific strategies should be adopted for mountain areas, high rainfall tropics, uplands and irrigated plains.
 The crops covered should include foodgrains and oil seeds, cotton and jute, sugar cane, fruit, vegetables, dairy, meat, medicinal plants, spices, and agro-forestry for fodder, fuel and industrial raw materials.

Evolutionary Opportunities
 What then is the justification for predicting a bright future?
 There are political, economic, social and technological forces active in the world today that can override the causality of past trends and combine together to make this a time of unprecedented opportunity.
 Intellectual synthesis: War is the result of a conflict that leads to a forceful resolution followed by a fresh period of progress.
 The end of the Second World War marked the defeat of fascism.
 It gave birth to the United Nations, followed by the dissolution of colonial empires and freedom for more than forty subject nations.
 The end of the Cold War marks the end of a seventy-year confrontation between two opposing ideologies ‚Äì capitalist and socialist ‚Äì that reflected a more profound conflict between two fundamental aspects of human existence ‚Äì individual freedom and social responsibility.
 The posing of these two as opposite and mutually exclusive forces has for long limited our freedom of thought and action and prevented us from boldly experimenting with new ways to reconcile them.
 The peaceful termination of this confrontation has lowered the mental barriers.
 It provides us with an opportunity to synthesize these forces in a manner which balances individual freedom with collective action to eradicate the blatant manifestations of poverty, social injustice and inequity.

"Not a show off, just really eager to get you up here so I could watch your face when you first saw all of this."
 Alec had unzipped his backpack and started emptying it while he spoke.
 Working with his usual speed it was only seconds before he had a blanket laid out.
 He handed me a bottle of water and then helped me down.
 "You weren't kidding when you said this place was special."
 Alec smiled and then wrapped me in a light blanket.
 The heat had finally relented slightly.
 Not enough to actually make it comfortable, but this high up it was actually a little chilly.
 If I hadn't spent the last several weeks living in the air-conditioned haven of Alec's house, the cooler temperatures at the top of the mountain would almost have made the trip worthwhile all by themselves.
 "I've been wanting to bring you up here for a while.

She began covering his face with kisses.
 "I was so afraid that I wouldn't be able to get back to you.
 "How long have you been trying?"
 "Just this morning.
 Yesterday it occurred to me that if you were thinking about me the way I was thinking about you, you might open the door.
 I told my parents good-bye last night, but I really didn't know if I'd ever be able to get back.
 But here you were, thinking about me!"
 "I haven't stopped thinking about you."
 And when he'd read the pages about her and realized they hadn't changed, he'd wondered if maybe it was because she hadn‚Äôt stayed in 1927, had come back to 2011.
 Or rather, would come back to 2011.

Just when he was sure that he could not keep his arm still the pain smoothed and stopped.
 As Jordaan relaxed his grip and released him, Rodregas shook his arm and then his body, trying to feel the difference.
 It felt almost like someone had drawn all over him from the inside, but there was no visible difference.
 There was no sign that a bit of his magic had been used up in the creation of a permanent effect.
 Rodregas sat and watched as Doi‚Äôvan and then Imeralda undertook the inscription of the minor sigil.
 From Rodregas‚Äô perspective the next two seemed to withstand the pain a lot better than then he had.
 After all three were completed Imeralda used her magic to inscribe Jordaan.
 The healing sigil was the only sigil commonly used by magic users.
 A few were known to use sigils that improved memory or allowed one to store excess magic.
 After the sensation faded Rodregas felt no different than before.

It has been abandoned for a long time, but it is well made and there is water and lots of fruit trees and berry bushes that must be left over from an old orchard.‚Äù After a moment he added, ‚ÄúI always thought that if I ever needed a place to hide out that it was ideal.
 Of course it will be rough there.
 Outside of what we bring, there will not be much.
 But it will be a good place to rest and‚Ä¶‚Äù he said gently patting his stomach, ‚Äúheal up.

 ‚ÄúSounds like a place that will be hard to find, but is this not territory infested with wild Dire beast?‚Äù ‚ÄúYup,‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚Äúanother reason I think this area is usually hard to find; most people stay clear.‚Äù He continued after a pause to let them think of entering territory known to be the hunting range of feared predators, ‚ÄúI never saw any sign of any Dire beast in the hollows when I was there, but, of course, they probably know of the place.
 Still, I would rather handle a pack of Hellhounds than The Immortal Guards.‚Äù Neither looked pleased at his logic, but both nodded.
 A few hours later it was starting to get dark as Rodregas recognized the spot and turned the wagon left for the final hard assent.
 At this point there was no trail, and common sense would have argued against the path.
 It was hard work.

‚ÄúWhere to?‚Äù he asked instead.
 Qurrah glanced outside the door.
 ‚ÄúThe battle is moving on.
 Follow me.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúLead on,‚Äù he said, trudging after his brother into the daylight chaos.

 Out the window Aurelia stared, frowning as she watched the battle unfold.
 ‚ÄúAurelia,‚Äù called a voice from behind.
 She turned to see a female elf, a friend of hers from many years before she moved to Woodhaven.

‚ÄúMine,‚Äù said Qurrah.
 And then blood poured out from the face of the lone elf.
 The eyeballs hit the ground before the dead body did.
 ‚ÄúHurry,‚Äù the necromancer said.
 ‚ÄúThis is but a taste of what we must do.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúVery well,‚Äù Harruq said.
 He tried to follow but the pain in his side stopped him.
 He clutched his bleeding side and breathed deeply.
 His armor had saved him, but the elf had managed to penetrate deeper than he thought.
 ‚ÄúAre you fine, Harruq?‚Äù Qurrah asked, glancing back and halting his walk.

I was too drained.
 And I was scared.
 I didn‚Äôt know what had happened, what was wrong with me, but I was certain whatever it was, Chevelle would take me straight back to the village.
 We stayed there for some time, a fact for which I was grateful.
 Even though whatever had happened seemed to have passed, neither man seemed in a hurry to go.
 Chevelle glanced at me occasionally but kept himself busy around the fire.
 Steed still played with his feather, eventually entertaining me with it.
 It spun toward me and turned down, tickling my arm and then my nose.
 I giggled despite my wariness, and reached up to rub my nose where the plume had brushed it.
 I noticed the map on my palms.

The voice whispered as faintly as the breeze.
 What, I thought, was that?
 You must stop it.
 I gritted my teeth in annoyance.
 I‚Äôm sick and tired of your riddles, whoever you are.
 Just give me a straight answer or I can‚Äôt do anything.
 It all comes down to this.
 What is coming?
 I cried out in frustration.
 It didn‚Äôt reply to me again, so I continued to walk down the hill.

The elf tried batting the bones away, but he was a fool, unaware of the strength guiding them.
 They shattered his bow, crashed into his slender form, and tore flesh and armor.
 ‚ÄúKill him,‚Äù Qurrah said to the bones.
 They swirled in the air above the elf like a tornado, and all at once they plunged downward, deep into his flesh.
 More shouts.
 He turned north and ran deeper into Singhelm.
 He doubted any humans patrolled the area, not after the defeat of their army.
 If he was to find safety, it would be there.
 In each ragged breath, he gasped, tasting copper on his tongue.
 His back ached, and his whole body revolted against his constant motion.

What‚Äôs that mean?‚Äù I shrugged.
 We hugged stiffly.
 Then we parted and went our own ways.
 A few minutes later, I stumbled into my mom‚Äôs classroom at La Mesa Junior High School, while Billy and Cliff waited in my car.
 My mom was lecturing about prepositions.
 After a minute, she issued a reading assignment, followed me to a patio behind her room, and collapsed onto the picnic bench when I told her Eric was dead.
 ‚ÄúOh God,‚Äù she moaned.
 ‚ÄúNot again.‚Äù Cliff, Billy and I drove to their home.
 We spent an hour or so on an art project they were creating.
 They intended to draw a million small circles, just to see what a million looked like.

I wish I had a better answer to that question.
 Starlings, New York is not the place you‚Äôd expect much to happen.
 It‚Äôs a small quiet town, the kind where everyone knows your name.
 It‚Äôs a place where your parents wouldn‚Äôt even care if you stayed out late biking with your friends.
 Only because everyone felt so safe, so comfy.
 They don‚Äôt know the half of it.
 But I do.
 I know it all and Starlings is not the place where you want to be after dark.
 The only reason why no one knows this is because Jason, Emily, Seth and I have kept it that way.
 I walked along the empty road alone, occasionally waving to passing kids on bikes.

 He only ever says that he tripped.
 He‚Äôs been doing it since he was a kid.
 You know him, he won‚Äôt fight, no matter how he pretends at being evil.
 He always finds a way to wiggle out of trouble.

Throughout their childhoods, we‚Äôve had a good life and a beautiful home, nice cars, good communities, and the best of schools.
 I encouraged their interests by making sure they had the equipment they needed to pursue them.
 For instance, when Brandon showed a real interest in and talent for photography, he received his dream camera for Christmas.
 I have loved my wife and I have shown my children that I love them.
 The boys have witnessed firsthand what a healthy spousal relationship is and that was something I never saw in my childhood home.
 I always believed in teaching my children to respect all people in all walks of life.
 On the holidays I sent my boys out to give freshly baked cookies to the people who collected our garbage.
 I taught the boys how to care for our yard, mowing and edging, and they had household responsibilities and chores (and I never sprayed them with a hose nozzle, at least not to compel yard work).
 I believed they needed to learn good strong work ethics.
 But I never once hit them, and I never abused them, as I had learned ‚Äúwhat not to do‚Äù as a father.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beautiful,‚Äù I said, moving to touch it.
 He held up his other hand up to stop me.
 ‚ÄúTake it.‚Äù I wanted to hold the trinket; I reached forward and concentrated on moving it from his palm to mine.
 It floated shakily across the space between us, which seemed so odd at first I thought Chevelle must have moved it.
 I squeezed my fingers around it, as if to verify it was real, but when I opened my hand again it was only the dull gray rock.
 Disappointment filled my face as I looked back at him.
 He tilted his head toward the stone; I would have to make this sculpture myself.
 I closed my fist around it, mostly because I had seen him do the same, and instantly I knew what I wanted to see.
 I opened my palm up, grinning triumphantly, and exposed my creation for Chevelle to see.
 Balancing there was a slightly misshapen but undeniable sculpture of a small black horse.

Even though I lived on my own, I was still a kid and I knew no better than to live like one.
 I found myself associated with a group at school referred to by some as ‚Äúhot-rodders‚Äù and by others as ‚Äúburnouts.‚Äù The hot-rodders loved and raced every kind of American muscle car you could imagine, and this was what drew me to them.
 As every school has its ‚Äújocks,‚Äù ‚Äúnerds,‚Äù ‚Äúburnouts,‚Äù and other cliques and the reps that go along with them, it is difficult for an impressionable adolescent to avoid.
 The hot-rodders had a ‚Äúbad boy‚Äù reputation affiliated with drug use.
 Many hot-rodders did drugs and many of us sold drugs (usually to the jocks).
 It was the days of cocaine and pot, and I saw and consumed my share of it.
 Thomas became one of the bigger drug dealers in town.
 His house was filled with booze and drugs of all types.
 Cocaine was the most popular, that, and pot; but magic mushrooms and acid were also available.
 It was the late seventies, after all.

She lay there for a few more minutes, but she was too restless to keep lying still, especially with no one to talk to.
 So at last she jumped up and ran into the waves.
 Rick woke up slowly with no idea of how long he'd been asleep.
 It had been an exhausting week, and he'd gotten less sleep than usual.
 Of course, he'd had much more fun than usual too, he thought with a lazy smile.
 He turned to see if Marie was asleep.
 She wasn't there!
 Springing to his feet, he looked around.
 The beach had become crowded while he was asleep, and he didn't see her anywhere.
 "Marie!"

I mean they aren't just going to fight until first blood, are they?"
 Isaac's nod was hesitant, like he knew I was headed towards things he wasn't supposed to tell me.
 "I'm afraid the contest is quite serious, but still nothing for you to worry about."
 That didn't add up in the slightest.
 "I don't believe you.
 At least not the part about it not being anything to worry about.
 You all wouldn't have been so worried about Alec bringing me home Friday night if this was all no big deal.
 None of you have argued with Alec about anything since then, but Friday night James, Jasmin and Jessica were all ready to rip my head off over his express orders."
 The nod I received this time was even slower than the first.
 I waited for Isaac to say something, but he seemed unwilling to give away anything I hadn't already figured out for myself.

I looked around blankly for several more heartbeats before I finally managed to place the noise.
 Wolves.
 There weren't supposed to be any wolves in the area, but there wasn't any ignoring my ears.
 I numbly pulled myself back up, and began stumbling back towards the party, only to stop as another howl echoed down through the canyon.
 It was between me and everyone else.
 I turned and started into a shuffling run.
 Maybe the wolf would be attracted to the noise and light.
 Maybe I'd be able to get far enough away it wouldn't smell me.
 I'd only been moving for about a minute before another howl sent chills running down my spine.
 It sounded like a different wolf, and it was closer than the first one.

 Her life was already on record?
 She was going to have three children?

 At least not with Davis, because she wasn‚Äôt going to marry him.

The protection of the people, of the secrets that guard our nature from the dayborn, represents a law that supersedes any question of territory or dominance."
 The energy suddenly rolling off of the gathered shape shifters nearly drove me to my knees as Alec continued.
 "By their actions Adriana Paige learned of our nature, and it was only by the grace of the Maker that I was able to stop them from killing her.
 Their deaths were an unavoidable price to save an innocent."
 Some of the faces across the circle from me flinched a little, and I had a moment to wonder if Brandon hadn't told them the truth about what'd happened.
 "Her life belonged to me, it was mine to dispose of as I saw fit."
 I opened my mouth to protest, but closed it at a sharp jab in the ribs from Rachel.
 "The ancient laws don't support her life being a disposable commodity, extinguished at your whim.
 Not even the bond of Ja'tell provides you with that right."
 Brandon's grin was wider even than before.

When he slept, I went into the bedroom to see if his chest was inflating with air to assure me he was still alive.
 It reminded me of when our boys were babies and sometimes we would check on them in the night or as they napped and we never left the room until we verified they were breathing just because that is what a parent does.
 Chapter 15: Happy Frickin‚Äô Holidays!
 As Thanksgiving approached, our traditions looked impossible to pull off.
 We were evasive when we called my wife‚Äôs parents to tell them not to come to our house as they usually did.
 We said we had some personal family issues to deal with.
 We could tell their feelings were hurt, but we didn‚Äôt feel we had any other choice.
 We did allow my younger brother Harry in on the whole awful situation and invited him to come to the house as planned.
 I needed my younger brother because he had developed a great relationship with my boys.
 He‚Äôs 11 years younger than me, and in the music business where he works shooting videos for rap artists my sons listen to.

We choose to break God's moral laws.
 We become drunkards or fornicators, selfish, consumed with pride and prejudice and intolerance.
 But the sinful heart can‚Äôt find happiness.
 And God, he assured us, wants his creatures to get happy, which is why Christ said we must be born again, so he could give us new moral natures, new affections, new objectives, and new directions.
 What planted the hook in me was: according to Billy Graham, when you make your decision for Christ, you do it for the sake of the nation and the world.
 Without God, any nation will perish.
 And a nation is only as strong as its people.
 A better world requires better nations of better people.
 Christ can make us into those people.
 Billy Graham had injected some hope into at least one heart often shamed by its selfish and ornery ways.

But best of all, we would walk or sit on the beach for hours talking.
 He was wonderful, and I loved him with all my heart."
 She paused, smiling as she reached out to touch a lock of Marie's hair.
 "Every time we kissed, I felt it all over."
 Marie's eyes flew to her mother's.
 "Why didn't you marry him?"
 Mrs. Tranton's face sobered.
 "He died.
 He drowned trying to save his little cousin."
 She drew in a deep breath.

 Something about my vision has changed, much like it did long ago, first when I got knocked out in Las Vegas and awoke overlooking a heavenly forest, and again on the bank of the Tia Juana river the morning after a Billy Graham crusade, when the world turned brighter.
 Now, during and since my trip north, I often see people more clearly.
 I'm better at seeing God in the sorrow of a destitute fellow, one of those folks Hank Williams called "men with broken hearts", or in the patient nod of a sales clerk as I decide whether to buy a magazine, or in a woman's kind smile.
 When I need a break from work or chores, and sometimes while reading or praying, I sit on the back porch like my mom used to do.
 The view was the reason she gave for not selling the house after I left home.
 As I sit and gaze toward the Mexican border, I think of Eric, and how we used to peer through twilight and try to locate his home in the valley about five miles closer to Mexico.
 Which reminds me of Sylvia and how the cruelty of the world drove her crazy, and I wonder if turning to Jesus might have cured her, if she had let him expel her bitterness.
 Because for those who fail to discover peace and even joy in the midst of the cruelty, going mad is only sensible.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you tell him about me?
 Well?
 Why not?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just embarrassed, all right,‚Äù he finally muttered.

It arced back and forth between us with a fury that jolted me all the way down to the soles of my feet as Vincent and Cassie came into sight.
 The answering surges of power from the two rival shape shifters made my hair stand on end as Jasmin shoved me into the classroom, moving with only slightly more than human speed.
 I probably should have cleared out of the way, but despite there being nothing I could do to help Jasmin if it came to an open fight, I wasn't going to abandon her.
 As Vincent and Cassie got closer, something about them seemed off.
 It is amazing how the mind focuses in on minutia when things get really scary, but I couldn't think of anything else until I realized it was their eyes.
 Cassie's had gone a pale, unearthly green, while Vincent's had deepened into a near black.
 If eyes really were the windows to the soul, he'd become so twisted and warped there wasn't much left that could truly be considered human.
 The halls had emptied remarkably fast, especially considering how much gossip there was for the rumor mill.
 It was almost like some primitive survival instinct had kicked in and steered everyone away from ground zero.
 With the two of them so much closer, I could feel their energy beating at Jasmin and me.

No moving around.‚Äù He told me that in the case of a weapon, they would come in from both sides of the truck with their guns drawn.
 The shooting officers would be on the driver‚Äôs side firing over my head.
 (How comforting).
 What had I gotten myself into?
 I didn‚Äôt want brains splattered all over my truck, especially if they were mine!
 I was then shown pictures so I could verify Ashley and recognize Steve.
 It was her, and his head was practically shaved bald.
 He looked like your typical punk kid, just like Brandon.
 ‚ÄúIs his hair still that short?‚Äù I asked.
 ‚ÄúNot the last I saw.

As Dino walked towards me I could see the crowd of guests rushing in behind him.
 He straddled me and I gathered my legs towards my chest with my arms crossed in front of my face to protect myself.
 He looked like a killer standing over me, his eyes big, his teeth gritted and his right fist well above his head poised to pound me again.
 I straightened my right leg out as a kick upward directly into his crotch as hard and fast as I could.
 His body folded around my foot.
 He fell backwards on the ground exposing the crowd of onlookers who stood behind him.
 I stood up and walked by him, looking down at him curled and rolling in obvious agony.
 I walked through the crowd, which parted as I approached.
 Another defining moment.
 I went to stay with a friend, and I never went home again as long as Dino was alive.

Pretty soon it was right there on albums, you know‚Äîpsychedelia, via the laboratory.
 Psychedelic rock was just acid put to music, you know.
 Suddenly there were drug songs.
 ‚ÄúWhite Rabbit.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAmphetamine Annie.‚Äù ‚ÄúShe Said She Said,‚Äù supposedly.
 Everyone thinks ‚ÄúOpen Channel D‚Äù is about turning on, man, but, no, no, you get the reference.
 I mean, sure, open your mind, yeah, that‚Äôs psychedelia‚Äôs code-word.
 I wrote ‚ÄúStrawberry Fields for a While‚Äù on acid, appropriately.
 I mean, I did it on purpose.
 I wanted to answer John, send him a valentine as it was, and I thought, well, I should be tripping because that‚Äôs such a trippy song, you know?
 So, I did that.

 ‚ÄúWhat does this all mean?‚Äù I asked her.
 She was silent, ‚ÄúI guess the person they‚Äôre talking about is Kojas, but we don‚Äôt know who he is, or if he‚Äôs important.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm thinking he‚Äôs important because these weird dwarfs keep talking about him.
 Maybe he‚Äôs their idol or something.‚Äù I said.

See, Lor, instinctively knew that was the sticking point, that me making music again was the key, but, also my deepest fear‚Äîthat I‚Äôd lost it all.
 That I‚Äôd never write another meaningful song.
 I‚Äôd rather not say which hospital this was.
 Just because of, you know, the privacy thing.
 I think I‚Äôm supposed to be discrete about that.
 CM:  	What turned it around?
 BG:  	I don‚Äôt know really.
 I don‚Äôt know if it really got turned around.
 One day I woke up and I felt pretty good, you know.
 The sun was coming in the window there and I was digging the way the dust motes floated in it, as if they were little living things, and I thought, I‚Äôve had enough of this shit.

We heard Brandon‚Äôs girlfriend, Tiffanie, was afraid to return to the house while our son was in jail and it was probably the smartest thing she had done in years.
 Brandon had accumulated flat screen TV‚Äôs, computers, stereo equipment, guns, you name it and it was all gone.
 Most of it, if not all of it was drug trade merchandise or purchased with drug sale money before his drug habit escalated to the point that his addiction was larger than he could support with his sales.
 The area under the rental house had been dug out and reinforced to grow indoor marijuana.
 It resembled an escape tunnel from a prison movie.
 None of this was intended for the eyes of a parent.
 I don‚Äôt believe mine or Thomas‚Äôs place ever looked half as bad, but if I could see the boxing ring, mismatched couches and the hanging roach clip from where I stand now, who knows what it would look like to me.
 We spent the next 12 hours cleaning, hauling and tossing.
 We rented a local storage unit and brought the furniture and clothes there but we tossed out more than we took.
 We filled nearly fifty large black garbage bags of filth and drug paraphernalia and left them for trash pickup in the alley behind the house.

I was only partly right.
 It took quite a while for me to go to sleep, but this time the culprit was the light outside my window.
 Chapter 14 For the first time in longer than I could remember, I woke up two minutes before my alarm went off.
 I was showered, dressed, and ready to go ten minutes before normal, but after pulling my books together, I just sat down on the sofa.
 Today was the day.
 I hadn't consciously planned it when I went to bed, but circumstances were perfect.
 If I was wrong, Mom was not only home, judging by the noises filtering down the stairs, she was awake and only a few minutes away from coming downstairs.
 Even filled with the near certainty that Brandon's parents, and by extension him, were our secret benefactors, the next fifteen minutes were some of the longest in my life.
 When Brandon's Mustang finally appeared around the bend in the lane, I found myself smiling so hard my face was starting to hurt.
 Breathing silent but heartfelt thanks that Mom was in the shower and therefore couldn't hear the low rumble of the Mustang's engine, I slipped out the front door and skipped down the concrete steps.

Unfortunately my mostly-full bottle of water splashed all over both of us.
 I felt my cheeks go hot.
 Britney gasped and giggled.
 I silently told myself things were as bad as they were going to get.
 I was wrong.
 The boy wasn't as cute as Alec, but he was so close I could hear those cosmic scales being melted down into something useless again.
 Paperweights maybe.
 I didn't want to see the mess my water had made of his shirt, so I started at the top and worked my way down.
 I'd seen better hair in a couple of fashion magazines, but not very many.
 Casually windswept, straight blond hair had become iconic sometime in the last few years, and this boy either spent an hour on his hair each morning, or the wind in Utah was kinder and gentler than the wind in Minnesota.

Even back when I'd had a more substantial appetite, I still couldn't have kept up with the wolves.
 Even the girls packed away more food than I would've believed possible for such slender frames.
 I mentally shrugged and added it to the list of shape shifter benefits.
 Able to eat like a complete pig and still slip into size zero jeans.
 Dominic spent a couple hours after dinner helping me with Spanish.
 She probably would've spent even longer with me, but Mom called, so Dominic slipped out to give me some privacy.
 I fielded something like a hundred questions about school, reassured her two or three times that she wasn't a terrible mother, and promised yet again to stay one hundred percent out of trouble while she was gone.
 I was beginning to wonder if I was ever going to get off the phone when she finally decided, ultra-late shoot tomorrow or not, she'd better go to bed.
 By the time I finally finished up the rest of my studying, decided I was ready for my catch-up test in Mrs. Campbell's class tomorrow, and spent a few minutes with Rachel, I was well and truly exhausted.
 I thought about going back to the Lilac Room, but it would've just been because I was worried about what everyone else was thinking.

‚ÄúChevelle Vattier.‚Äù ‚ÄúVattier, eh?‚Äù I thought I heard the stranger mutter under his breath, ‚ÄúWell, you can call me Bonnie Bell.‚Äù Chevelle waited unmoved for his response.
 He finally held his hand out in return.
 ‚ÄúSteed.
 Steed Summit.‚Äù They shot me a glare as my giggle slipped out.
 Steed stared at me.
 He especially didn‚Äôt seem to think it was funny.
 ‚ÄúOur lineage is long and we breed the best stallions in the land.‚Äù Chevelle spoke up.
 ‚ÄúYes, I have heard much regarding the lines of Free Runner and Grand Spirit.
 Tell me, is that what brings you out this far?‚Äù They carried on the exchange and Chevelle explained we‚Äôd be needing horses.
 I sat back down, defeated.

I mustered a brave smile as I nodded and let him lead me out onto the dance floor.
 It was a slow song this time, and Alec didn't protest when I abandoned all pretense of actual dancing, and just leaned into him hungrily.
 The reassurance I was seeking was weaker than normal.
 The solid feel of his body was just as permanent as always, but there was no tingle where our skin touched.
 Almost as though sensing my thoughts, Alec hugged me tightly and buried his chin in my hair.
 "I know you don't want to hear this, but it isn't too late for you to change your mind.
 Even now, it'd be a relatively simple thing to have you halfway across the country by the time the challenge actually occurs."
 The thought of what was coming filled me with dread, but I shook my head.
 As scary as all of this was, I knew flying away and never knowing what'd happened would be worse.
 Alec was probably going to die, and all of the rest of us with him, but if he didn't, if the pack somehow managed to survive the coming crisis, I wanted to be there.

Donovan's smile had a surprising touch of mischief to it.
 "Actually, you could say that we have two.
 In a manner of speaking."
 I felt a more genuine smile working its way across my face.
 "Could we go to one of them?
 I really should be doing my homework, but I'd much rather just curl up with a good book."
 Donovan picked up the cell phone that I, unsure whether or not it was really mine, had left on the bed, and handed it to me.
 "I believe you'll want to keep this with you at all times.
 Otherwise it won't be able to fulfill its assigned purpose.
 And yes, we can most definitely go to one of the libraries.

I might see some lint on your shirt that needed to be brushed off.
 Like this."
 He turned to face her and reached behind her to brush off the imaginary lint, his arm drawing her close.
 Marie laughed.
 "I think there's lint a little lower on my back."
 Reaching lower meant he had to draw her closer.
 "Hmmm--there's a piece at the top too."
 His free hand slid along her waist and up to her shoulder blade, the result being an embrace.
 "Now you're lint free."
 She laughed again.

I have to do something.
 He's done so much for us."
 He stopped partway through shaking his head.
 "I can't promise he'll even bother to read it, but I'll take it to him if you promise never to talk about this again.
 I don't want to hear even the slightest rumor anything unusual happened in association with this project."
 I nodded, relieved I'd have a chance to jot down a couple of lines, that I'd at least have that much of a link with our protector.
 Mayor Wilkenson waited at the door, almost the perfect picture of a gentleman at his leisure, but his desire to be done with this whole affair was almost palpable.
 I hurried back to the kitchen counter and tore a piece of paper off of the tablet I'd been drawing on.
 Whoever you are thank you so much for what you've done.
 Not just for the job, but for smoothing things over with the bank as well.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said looking at us, ‚Äúwhat are you waiting for?‚Äù She disappeared in the cave.
 Then she poked her head out.
 ‚ÄúCome on!‚Äù We walked slowly into the cave.
 I glanced over at the dragon, which was now asleep and making small puffs of smoke in the rain.
 I sat on the cold stone floor, shivering.
 I was soaked to the skin and my hair was completely plastered to my head.
 Seth sat next to me and I could see he was shivering too.
 Jason slid down the wall across from us with his eyes closed.
 ‚ÄúI never want to walk again,‚Äù he mumbled.
 ‚ÄúNever.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou're going to have to, dude.

‚ÄúEric doesn‚Äôt steal,‚Äù Cliff said adamantly.
 Still, when Coach Gory dropped Cliff from the cross-country and track teams, he got afflicted with anger and confusion, wondering if Eric might‚Äôve been the thief after all.
 For a week or so, he seethed and Eric brooded, ashamed even that Cliff would suspect him.
 They passed each other in the halls without a greeting.
 It took the end of the world to renew their friendship.
 On a Friday night at my house we watched a movie called On the Beach.
 It began with a nuclear war.
 The human race died from north to south, until all that remained of humanity were some outposts in Australia, where foreign Navy ships had anchored.
 One by one the heroes expired, while the band played ‚ÄúWaltzing Matilda.‚Äù Cliff asked if we would go running with him on the cross-country course at Balboa Park, near downtown San Diego, where the previous year he had scored his only first-place finish.
 He wanted to run there one last time, before the end of the world.

The answer was like something you'd expect from a politician.
 It conveyed absolutely no information, and his supreme confidence was infuriating.
 Luckily, I wouldn't have to hold my tongue for very long.
 We were already gliding around the last bend in the road before our lane.
 I expected Alec to slow to a stop and make me walk like James had.
 He slowed, but just enough to make the turn down the dusty lane.
 Rachel jumped out of the car as soon as it slowed down and opened my door for me.
 "Enjoy the rest of your night, and don't lose hope on Les Mis√©rables.
 You never know when you're going to beat the odds."
 Shaking my head in amazement at Rachel's unfailing optimism, I turned to thank Alec for the ride.

Should anybody except Karen want a date with me, she had better tell her friend to pass the word along.
 I wouldn‚Äôt even ask any other girl for a dance without having already gotten the nod.
 Karen had pink, full lips and plenty of curves, and lively unhaunted eyes.
 She read books for fun and spoke softly, humbly, and acted just as nice to the lowly as to teachers or big shots.
 Besides, I had lately spent a day and evening, first at school, then at a community dance, and afterward at the Burger Hut, asking people whether they often felt guilty about something but had no idea what it was.
 I asked thirty or forty kids.
 Only one said no.
 Karen.
 Since then, I had spent many hours dreaming that she and I could run off to live in some woodland cottage.
 Maybe near a golf course, since the smashing of golf balls had become my best means of fighting the grief over losing my dad.

She swung hard at his open side; he had time to block her stroke but his sword shattered when the two swords collided.
 Her sword was at his throat before he could do anything and the officiating knight yelled a stop to the match, handing the yellow band to Karun and the white second place finish to Rodregas.
 Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda met him at the entrance to the cafeteria, Rodregas stalked in without looking at them and stood quietly in line to get his large bowl of stew and chunk of bread.
 They sat down away from where most of the other squires.
 The other two sat quietly until all three had finished the repast.
 ‚ÄúSo how did Geriodon and Nordien finish?‚Äù asked Rodregas.
 Doi‚Äôvan spoke, ‚ÄúGeriodon finished first place which puts him in the total lead with a perfect fifteen points.
 Nordien only got a third place red ribbon so he has only eleven, Karun is now second with thirteen points.‚Äù Rodregas nodded.
 With only nine points he was unlikely to be able to compete in the final championship melee.
 ‚ÄúImeralda, can you do me a favor?‚Äù Rodregas asked.

Her heart tightened.
 "Thank you."
 She tilted her head back to look up at him.
 "Thank you so much, Rick."
 He stroked her cheek with his forefinger.
 "I'd do anything for you, sweetheart."
 When she didn't look away, simply continuing to gaze into his eyes, he slowly lowered his mouth to hers, brushing his lips over hers.
 She didn't pull away.
 Gathering her closer, he kissed her gently.
 Marie's pulse raced as Rick's lips moved over hers.

I knew you were brave and courageous, but now I know where your true magic talent is...‚Äù He looked at her eyes as he spoke and even when he smiled at his own words, he let her see the sincerity of what he said.
 The main rule of flattery with women is to never lie.
 It was a lesson taught to Rodregas by a lost love, and one that had served him well over the years.
 Most women can always tell a lie, especially in such a moment of connection as the talk after good sex.
 Luckily, even with far more normal women there is always something good you can say; with Imeralda he could have gone on for hours.
 Imeralda‚Äôs eyes lit up in pleasure and humor at his words but, of course, he was careful to say nothing of the future, nothing of love.
 Such talk would serve no purpose and would likely ruin the moment.
 To his surprise she also kept such thoughts to herself.
 The rest of the night, the two lovers spent quietly connected and at peace, but they shared few words.
 In the morning after meditation, Doi‚Äôvan pulled forth two wooden staves that he had cut and said with a smile and an exaggerated wink, ‚ÄúApparently you are healed up from your wound now, so I think it is time to stop with these making of shadows like children and time for some more physical training.‚Äù As he finished speaking he tossed Rodregas one of the staves.

I walked through the crowd, which parted as I approached.
 Another defining moment.
 I went to stay with a friend, and I never went home again as long as Dino was alive.
 I promised myself over and over again that if I ever had children, I would never beat them.
 Chapter 7: Now the Truth Comes Out My phone is ringing but this time it is the hands free unit in my ear, my real cell phone number, not the crack-berry.
 I am not here alone, in fact there are about twenty undercover officers with me, but I‚Äôm no cop.
 On the phone is lead undercover narcotics officer Denny White.
 Officer White wants to do a last minute sound check on the wire that I am wearing taped to my back.
 It seems that my lack of noise has caused the undercover officers who surround me in cars, vans and bushes to become concerned that they have lost sound.
 They haven‚Äôt heard a word from me since my last crack-berry conversation with Ashley, the suspect that I have set up in exchange for dropping pending drug dealing charges.

‚ÄúWhat do you say, Doi‚Äôvan, are you ready to learn some magic?
 I saw how you reacted to the ley line; you clearly have some power.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan tilted his head to me and said, ‚ÄúReally, do you think so?
 I do feel something now and then, but I have never been tested.
 People see me and how strong I am, they just assume I don‚Äôt have magic for some reason.‚Äù ‚ÄúWish I had that problem,‚Äù Rodregas said.
 ‚ÄúI mean before, people always used to assume I had neither brawn nor brains.‚Äù With a smile he added, ‚ÄúWhat do you say?
 Shall the three of us set some time aside to teach each other what we know of magic and see what we can learn from these magic books of Ravenhurr‚Äôs?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúI mean, yes, I would like to learn what you can teach me.
 I like to learn,‚Äù he said slowly but carefully.
 The big guy was embarrassed.

I tried to argue but couldn't find the strength.
 A while later the flash of light as James and Isaac lit flares pulled me back awake.
 It took several seconds for my eyes to adjust, and then I started being able to pick out individual shapes in the darkness.
 Alec set me down as Vincent appeared, a towering, furred figure illuminated by the light of the flares that'd been planted on either side of the cleared space.
 His dark eyes drank in the light as he surveyed us with his typical boundless arrogance.
 A horde of shifting figures milled about just outside of the twin circles of light.
 The rest of Brandon's pack and they seemed to have grown in number since the dance.
 Jasmin and Dominic crowded up against me, one on either side, and I let my hands brush against their heads.
 The feel of their fur, one short and soft, the other long and coarse, anchored me before the surreal strangeness of the scene could carry me away.
 The tingle of shape shifter power was as strong as I'd ever felt it, jumping from multiple sources, arcing around me as it unsuccessfully looked for a place to ground out.

He looked down at her with chagrin.
 "I didn't even think about that.

 And I should have shown you how to use the washer and dryer.

 "But we're going to the shore."
 "I'll show you when we get home.
 Come on--let's go buy you some more outfits."
 He insisted on buying her a pair of pants, a dress, two t-shirts, and two pairs of shorts.
 "But Rick, what if I get back to 1927 tomorrow?"

Longswords hung from their belts.
 ‚ÄúMe be Harruq Tun!‚Äù the half-orc said as he stepped further into the light, grinning stupidly.
 ‚ÄúAnd this be me brother, Qurrah!‚Äù
 ‚ÄúGet back you smelly thing,‚Äù the other guard said.
 Both stood to face him as other guards stirred from their blankets and bedrolls.
 They still wore their chainmail, proof something had disturbed them greatly.
 Sleeping in armor was far from comfortable.
 ‚ÄúMe only a little smelly,‚Äù Harruq slurred.

He frowned.
 "You don't want me to be nice to you?"
 "No."
 She sat up and held out her hand for his handkerchief.

 "It confuses me."
 "How?"
 "It just does."
 More tears slid down her cheeks.

The Immortalists are a sore on the world.
 Their use of others‚Äô bodies and power and their very way of life is abhorrent.‚Äù Rodregas looked Doi‚Äôvan in the eyes and said, ‚ÄúThe name I was born with is Rodregas.
 When I decided to kill Ravenhurr, I promised the gods that if they let me survive, I would take on the duty of killing the Immortalists.
 It is a duty that I know will end in my death.
 There are hundreds of Immortalists.
 Some almost as powerful as gods, but it is a good death and one I have chosen.‚Äù Rodregas paused and looked at Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs features.
 They were brutish and rough by human standards, but his instincts said that this man was honest, and he added, ‚ÄúIf for a while you wish to share my duty and fight at my side, then we walk a path bathed in the Celestial light.‚Äù Rodregas had spoken slowly and clearly so Doi‚Äôvan would understand the depth of what he said.
 They stood there gripping each other‚Äôs forearms and then Doi‚Äôvan nodded and replied, ‚ÄúThen let us walk this path together.‚Äù He was speaking in that deep voice; his statement had finality about it.
 It was a good moment, one of those moments when two people realize that they are going to share the path of life and possibly death.
 It did not last long for as they broke their grip Imeralda said, ‚ÄúAll right, you two are pretty tough and all, but don‚Äôt expect me to join in this crazy crusade.

 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better to spar with another, remember?‚Äù
 Aurelia frowned.
 ‚ÄúYou know I am a sorceress.
 My time should be spent studying my craft.
 I only wanted to be proficient with my staff, not a master.‚Äù
 A tiny bit of panic crept into Harruq‚Äôs voice.
 ‚ÄúYeah, but, but, it‚Äôs only an hour or two, and who said you were proficient anyway?
 I could beat you without trying, and so could anyone better than me.

Trying to be as casual as possible, I looked into the art room as I hobbled by, but they'd rearranged their stations, and someone's easel was in the way now.
 The sprained ankle had slowed me down enough that there was no way I was going to make it back to my locker before the bell rang.
 Still, I tried to be gracious when it went off just as I handed Mrs. North the papers.
 Based on the number of classrooms on the second floor, and the narrowness of the stairs, there was no point in trying to wait the crowd out.
 I gritted my teeth and limped out into the surge of bodies.
 Surprisingly enough, there were more familiar faces than expected.
 As I grabbed the handrail on the right, I noticed Isaac several feet ahead of me.
 Of course, it's hard to miss someone nearly six feet tall and almost as well-muscled as Alec.
 Even if he was partially hidden by Vincent, who was strutting along a little higher up the stairs with all of his usual arrogance.
 If Isaac had been the one close enough to reach out and touch, I probably would've tried to get his attention and said hi.

She'd always been nice to Davis, but she'd never treated him like a son.
 But she'd love Rick.
 Rick was so warm and funny, and her mother would feel comfortable with him.
 She stopped, squeezing her eyes shut.
 She couldn't stop thinking about him.
 Even when she thought about her family, Rick somehow surfaced in her mind.
 Rick glanced at his watch.
 She'd been in the garden for 20 minutes.
 It was foggier than usual--was that an indication that there'd be a door or window or whatever back to 1927?
 Now that he'd told her he loved her, had opened his heart to her completely, he couldn't bear the thought that she might not walk back into his arms.

Not in the next two or three weeks at least.
 It felt like my whole world had just disappeared down a drain.
 I didn't suffer any real panic attacks, but more or less spent both days in a kind of despondency that wasn't much better than a full-blown attack.
 By the time Monday morning arrived I had vague memories of doing homework and not much else.
 The only positive from the whole weekend was the way my dream from Friday stayed with me.
 As I got ready for school I idly wondered if it would be possible to recreate the grotto in real life.
 Obviously not with the impossible, glowing water, but with the incredible, lush vegetation and the secluded pool.
 Then again, I'd seen Mom pull off some pretty crazy tricks with her camera, maybe there would be some way to simulate glowing water, some kind of photography trick I'd never heard of.
 I walked downstairs as the eastern sky was just starting to change colors.
 Mom was already gone.

Ravenhurr‚Äôs deep, melodious voice rumbled out, ‚ÄúSpitualu seperatia orgirgia turia,‚Äù and the middle, pale green circle started to burn.
 Rodregas could not pronounce the ancient version of the Eastern Common language Ravenhurr was using, but he thought that he understood the gist of the meaning.
 Rodregas could not believe the man did not try to battle his way out.
 The captain and Dale were both large men but it would have been very difficult to keep such a gifted athlete in the circle, even with clubs, if he was determined to escape.
 However, he was young and clearly lacked battle experience.
 He seemed unsure of what to do.
 Then it was too late; the blue flames of the circle rose high, then inward, and engulfed him.
 The young man started to split in two.
 The physical man stood there, but as he watched, another ethereal version, the man‚Äôs spirit, his very non-corporal essence, was suddenly pulled from his body, and then whipped around and out of the burning circle.
 Rodregas was not sure, but as this ethereal version of the man was pulled apart, Rodregas thought he could see him screaming.

"It's OK.  We have this whole parking lot--you can't hurt anything.
 Just relax and take your time."
 It took a while for her to get the hang of it, but an hour or so later, she was cruising around the parking lot, making reasonably smooth starts and stops.
 Rick was glad to see that her initial difficulties had made her cautious.
 That should curb her excitement when she got out on the road.
 They drove a little the next day, and Monday Rick picked up a booklet at the DMV.
 Marie spent all day Tuesday studying it and was sure that she could pass the test.
 Rick had found out, however, that she couldn't get one without a social security number.
 Marie was disappointed, of course, but Rick wasn't sure it was a good idea for her to drive alone, anyway, and she'd eventually want to do that if she had a license.
 Besides, he was putting together a surprise for her that he knew would take her mind off driving.

Even if that was true, it was becoming evident that she'd somehow stepped out of 1927 and into 2011.
 "Do you have an automobile?"
 "Yeah."
 "If I give you directions, will you take me there?"
 "OK.  Let's go."
 The automobile in the garage was different from any she'd ever seen.

It can only be done by the conscious initiative of government compelled by the expectations and demands of an electorate educated to understand the impact of government on economic life and the scope for increasing employment opportunities in a market economy.
 If society decides that useful jobs must be created, then they will be created.
 Full employment can be achieved by any country that has the will and determination to achieve it.
 This does not mean that every country can accomplish the goal immediately.
 Nor does it mean that governments should try to spend their way out of unemployment by creating artificial jobs for all who seek them.
 But the high current costs of the unemployed certainly suggest that there are more constructive ways to spend available resources to solve the problem.
 Instead, a commitment to self-employment should lead the government to reexamine and where necessary alter the nature of its priorities and policies and the structure of its economic system in order to make achievement of this goal possible.
 The magnitude of the task and the prescription may vary, but the goal and determination can be shared by all.
 Employment Strategies for the Industrial Nations
 In the industrial countries, the phenomena of jobless growth coupled with persistently high rates of youth unemployment and of chronic unemployment among the poorer sections will not be eradicated by even the most optimistic rates of economic expansion or mere incremental adjustments within the context of present attitudes and policies.

Why the sudden bashfulness?"
 My throat seemed to be spending an awful lot of the time lately constricted down to the point where speech was all but impossible.
 It was even worse than usual now.
 I thought maybe he'd have moved on to something else by the time I was able to talk again, but he was still patiently waiting when I managed to make myself look up again.
 It was tempting to lie and tell him I was just thinking about Cindi, the only one in the family who'd ever really had any luck in the dating department, but that wasn't fair.
 Besides, it would only put off the dreaded day.
 Eventually he'd find out what I was really like.
 When the words finally made it out, they seemed to fight me the whole way, clawing at my throat with such force that by the time they finally exited my mouth, they were the barest hint of a whisper.
 "Because I'm worried once you realize just how much of a loser I was back home, how much of a loser I still am, you'll decide you don't belong with me."
 "Why would you not dating very much have any impact on how I feel about you?"

Jim ‚Äì They‚Äôre both healthy active adults.
 They made you didn‚Äôt they.
 Just in case you slept through health class, sex is how babies are made.
 Liz ‚Äì First of all, it‚Äôs disgusting thinking about my parents doing that.
 Secondly, even when they sleep in the same house, they sleep in different beds.
 Jim ‚Äì They sleep in different beds?
 It‚Äôs like a 1950‚Äôs television show.
 Anyways they could push the beds together from time to time.
 Liz ‚Äì They couldn‚Äôt push the beds together though, they sleep in different rooms.
 Jim ‚Äì I‚Äôm surprised that each of them doesn‚Äôt have their own porn collections that rival my dad‚Äôs.

‚ÄúYou bastard!‚Äù he shouted, slamming into the elf without pausing.
 He buried his swords deep into the elf‚Äôs chest as he plowed forward.
 ‚ÄúYou hurt my brother!
 You spineless cowards!‚Äù The other two abandoned their bows and drew their blades.
 ‚ÄúYour brother is dead,‚Äù one elf said.
 ‚ÄúGaelwren waited for your departure.
 He will not find it difficult killing a wounded dog.‚Äù
 The anger inside Harruq consumed him entirely.
 He charged the elf, abandoning any hint of precaution.
 He slammed his blades down with all his might.

The hundreds of petals had been joined by a dozen of their potted sisters.
 Their rich, heavenly scent filled the air from scores of perfect, tall buds, and I found myself leaning forward slightly in Alec's arms in an effort to capture more of its essence.
 Alec circled the pool and then stopped before a wooden easel that'd escaped my notice.
 The subtle tinkling of the tiny waterfall behind us was suddenly joined by a slight, but definitely cooling breeze that dove down into the grotto before making its way back out using the path we'd just followed in.
 It didn't seem fair for things to cool off now when it was so inconvenient after so many weeks of oppressive heat.
 I was still musing over the injustice of it all when Alec shifted me around so I was held in just one arm.
 "There's something I'd like you to have.
 Something I hope will help you remember what you mean to me..." He trailed off, and then seemingly at a loss for words, reached out and lifted the black velvet that'd been covering the painting.
 Another graceful gesture flipped on the set of soft lights surrounding its border.
 As always with Alec's paintings, it took me a second before I could shift my perspective enough to translate the beautiful formations of light into something I could tie to the drab, dreary world I inhabited.

Harruq tried to smile, but a sob came out instead.
 He hugged her, his forehead pressed against hers.
 ‚ÄúHelp me up,‚Äù she said.
 Harruq did as commanded.
 When she was standing, he grabbed his blades and sheathed them.
 She leaned all her weight against him, and such close contact only deepened his guilt and anger.
 He knew she watched him, and he wiped away his tears as quickly and subtly as he could.
 ‚ÄúWhy, Harruq?‚Äù she asked him.
 The half-orc shrugged.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶‚ÄåQurrah‚Ä¶‚ÄåI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

Whatever pain I might receive didn‚Äôt factor; I had wanted to hurt this wicked little redhead since the first time I‚Äôd seen her, since her hand reached out seductively toward Chevelle and collected my ruby.
 My palms lit where they wrapped around her arms.
 I would finally burn her.
 She cocked one eyebrow at me.
 ‚ÄúHalf fire fairy, silly.‚Äù And I flew through the air to land with a heavy thump a few yards away.
 ‚ÄúWell, it was a little unconventional, but at least you‚Äôre thinking on your feet,‚Äù she mused, straightening the material of her skirt.
 And then she giggled as she realized I was, in fact, not on my feet.
 My body ached as I stood and my best skill was useless.
 I desperately wanted to ask her to show me the way, but my ego stubbornly refused.
 Not her.

Harruq and Qurrah played that game well.
 They had grown up on the streets of Veldaren and fought for every scrap of food they‚Äôd eaten.
 They had punched and kicked for every soft, dry bed.
 Then, one day, they finally killed.
 ‚ÄúA fine home is any home that‚Äôs yours,‚Äù Harruq said as he forced back a couple planks sealing a window.
 ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt that right, Qurrah?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWhatever you say.‚Äù
 Once the window was unblocked, the two climbed in.
 They lived in what had once been a large shed.
 The door was still boarded shut, but the window, well‚Ä¶

"What do you mean?
 I've only met her the one time.
 She seemed normal enough.
 I guess a little distracted..." The chuckle I'd been waiting for surfaced, but it wasn't at all like his normal laugh.
 It was as if someone had sucked all of the joy and goodness out of the sound I'd grown to crave on a nearly subconscious level, and left a twisted shell.
 "She's definitely distracted.
 You could even say utterly disconnected from the world.
 Completely free from the present, always living in the past."
 "I don't understand how any of this ties together."
 He looked up at me for the first time, and the tortured look in his eyes made me hold onto his hand as tightly as I was able.

‚ÄúSeth, look!‚Äù I said and pointed to it.
 He came over and bent down, tracing the sign with his finger.
 I waited and finally said, ‚ÄúWell, do you know what it is?‚Äù Seth dropped his finger.
 ‚ÄúIt means, 'slayer of worlds'.
 Does that ring a bell?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow do you know that?‚Äù I asked.
 He shrugged.
 ‚ÄúI don't know how, I just do.
 Maybe that's my power.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, I want to go this way,‚Äù I said and pointed to the entrance.
 ‚ÄúIf something like that is on the entrance, I want to know where this goes.‚Äù ‚ÄúI agree but aren't we supposed to be trying to find Emily and Jason?‚Äù ‚ÄúI have an idea,‚Äù I said and pulled my bow off my back.
 I removed one of my arrows and put my bow on the ground.

‚ÄúVelixar is not who you think he is.
 He isn‚Äôt _what_ you think he is.
 He tried to kill me, Harruq.
 He enjoyed every second we fought.
 I saw many of my friends die at his hand.
 Do you know why he helps you?
 Why he claims to train you?‚Äù
 She gave no pause, no chance for him to answer.
 This was good, for he didn‚Äôt want to.
 Too much was on his mind for argument.

"Let's go in here."
 He led her into a large department store and began searching for ladies' lingerie.
 While Marie looked around at all the lacy, sometimes colorful articles, Rick found a saleslady.
 "My friend over there, for reasons I won't go into, may not know her sizes.
 Will you help her find a couple of bras and some underwear?"
 "Of course--I'll take care of her."
 The lady could tell Marie's underwear size with no problem.
 But when Marie came out of the dressing room complaining that the 32B was too tight, she wondered how she'd missed the girl's bust size by such a margin.
 Marie found that she loved shopping for modern lingerie.
 She liked lace and rich colors and chose black, emerald, fuchsia, and royal blue underwear.

Most importantly, there is hope where there is love and there is love where there is family.
 Within any family and throughout the generations there will be many moments that define you as a person.
 If you are a father or a mother now, there was a day when you were a son or a daughter.
 Perhaps one day you will become a grandparent.
 During all of these periods your experiences and certain moments mold you into who you will be.
 It isn‚Äôt easy to forget the dark places in your past but you can either learn from them and become a better person or repeat the same behavior and have it slowly destroy you.
 I make many mistakes as a father, but I have always tried the best I know how.
 Sometimes no matter what a person does as a parent, children may travel to dangerous places.
 Some will return from those places unharmed and some may never return.
 A family can look perfect from the outside but be quite the opposite on the inside.

It was a goofy smile, and Qurrah recognized the fear hiding behind it.
 ‚ÄúHurry,‚Äù Qurrah said as Harruq climbed, using a windowsill as a foothold.
 Together, they stood upon the roof and gazed over the wall, mesmerized by the sight before them.
 Mere seconds away, hundreds and hundreds of orcs charged.
 Their race could see as well in night as in day.
 That same racial ability allowed the two brothers to watch the approaching orcs, lean muscle bulging underneath their sweat-glistened pale gray skin.
 Some wore mismatched armor, though most had only skulls, straps of leather, and war paint covering their bodies.
 Wave after wave of arrows rained upon them, and those who fell were trampled by the rest, but the masses were not even slowed.
 Harruq pointed past the army to where a long line of men stood in the distance, carrying no light or torch.
 ‚ÄúWhat are they doing?‚Äù he asked.

Sure, Franz Kafka was an office worker and William Blake a printer, but Kafka didn‚Äôt live very long and Blake had no kids.
 Anyway, those guys were geniuses.
 Not me.
 So I worried, would the baby help squash my writer‚Äôs dreams.
 People heard I was going to be a father again and asked, "So how old will you be when the baby turns eighteen?"
 or "What if you die?"
 She‚Äôs a girl, the doctor said, and I reasoned a girl might be quieter, a little more gentle than a boy.
 Knowing her sex made her more real.
 For the first time, I started getting pictures.
 I saw her as thin, pale skinned and strong like her mom, with reddish hair of a peculiar henna-like tint.

I drew in a sharp intake of breath.
 I hadn‚Äôt noticed I had gotten so deeply involved in the story.
 I needed to rest, to finish my recovery and break the bonds.
 But I couldn‚Äôt seem to step away.
 I was unnaturally calm when they finally came for me.
 I knew they would recognize the signs.
 But it didn‚Äôt matter now.
 I walked forward, resigned to my fate.
 What I didn‚Äôt expect was their response.
 The throne room was full.

"I think she'll be fine, but maybe I should get her to the nurse.
 Just to be sure."
 Even as he was talking, Alec was moving towards the door.
 "There's really no need.
 I'm fine.
 I don't need to see the nurse."
 It was obvious he was going to ignore me.
 I tried to thrash around enough for him to put me down, but he restrained my arms with a couple of fingers.
 The motion was so casual I was pretty sure nobody even realized he'd pinned my arms to my stomach with surprising strength.
 I thought about kicking, or even screaming, but that would just leave me feeling like a child and give Alec exactly the kind of attention he was probably hoping for.

I stared in disbelief as the trees split to form a low lean-to.
 He shot me another wink; I couldn‚Äôt be sure he was kidding.
 The tearing and popping noises ceased, and I examined his creation.
 Quite impressive really.
 He didn‚Äôt even seem to be watching, let alone concentrating.
 And no blessings on it, no thanks to Mother Earth.
 It seemed he was just enjoying himself, not being responsible to the magic.
 Magic that I needed.
 That I wanted.
 He was good enough, there was no question of that.

Seconds later, he was startled by a giggle that interrupted their kiss.
 "What's so funny?"
 he demanded.
 "It works!"
 "What works?"
 "I thought about kissing you while I was looking at you, and you kissed me!"
 He shook his head.
 "So you were experimenting.

He lifted open a single eye and glared at the blurry image of his brother.
 ‚ÄúThe sun is almost up,‚Äù Qurrah said, kicking him again.
 ‚ÄúYou need to be as well.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWhat are you‚Ä¶‚Äåawww, damn it.‚Äù
 He sat up straight and shook his head, trying to clear the fuzz that clogged the vast empty space between his ears.
 Qurrah helped by offering a third kick, this one right to the kidney.
 Harruq gasped and staggered to his feet.
 He was outside their little home in seconds, urinating on the grass.
 ‚ÄúHadn‚Äôt pissed yet,‚Äù Harruq shouted to his brother.

The goddess gave them long life and abundant land so quarrels within their race were of the petty sort.
 Then the brother gods came.
 Ashhur of Justice, Karak of Order.
 There are many worlds beyond our own, Qurrah.
 I have seen fleeting glimpses of them in my dreams.
 Karak and Ashhur came from one of those worlds, and Celestia welcomed them.
 To them she gave the grasslands and rolling hills.
 ‚ÄúThese brother gods did not make their own creation.
 Instead, they made man, much the same as man existed in their former world.
 They wanted to make a paradise, one of justice and order.

He had no idea what she was trying to do, but at least they had something to try.
 He needed to keep Van‚Äôdret busy to give Imeralda time to do whatever magic she was going to cast.
 Rodregas turned to Van‚Äôdret and said, ‚ÄúWell, since you are killing us today, how about we make things interesting for both sides?
 I will answer a question of yours every time that you answer one of mine.‚Äù Van‚Äôdret expression darkened and he almost hissed his outrage, ‚ÄúYou would bargain with me, with your life held by a string?‚Äù For some strange reason that Rodregas was sure reflected a very deep character flaw, he felt his face break out in a very large toothy grin as he said, ‚ÄúAnd I have what to lose?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret stared at him for several long minutes before he shrugged and said, ‚ÄúVery well, ask me your question, but then you will answer mine or you die.‚Äù Rodregas simply nodded.
 He had no lack of questions, but was not sure which to ask first.
 He decided going small first would cause a less violent reaction.
 Rodregas said, ‚ÄúHow did you find us down here?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs expression at the question was like he had asked why is the sky blue.
 He nearly sneered his answer, ‚ÄúThrough magic, of course, a simple tracking spell.‚Äù Van‚Äôdret did not go small, ‚ÄúAre you three responsible for the death of the Immortalist Sorcerer Ravenhurr?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes and no,‚Äù responded Rodregas.

When I was blocking about half the strikes successfully, he pocketed the stone and progressed with sticks, water, fire, anything he found on the trail.
 We were still riding too fast and I was exhausted from the mental and physical exertion when he switched to full-body attacks.
 By nightfall I wasn‚Äôt able to fend off anything that came at me and he mercifully stopped the horses beneath another hollow in the mountain.
 I was asleep practically before I slid off my horse.
 The next morning I woke to the sound of rock against rock.
 There was no sign of Chevelle or his horse in the dim stone hollow.
 I sat up, rubbing my sore legs, unable to believe he‚Äôd left me.
 And then the rock wall struck me in the face.
 I cursed, my voice hoarse from sleep.
 The wall came at me again.

BG:  	Oh, yeah.
 That‚Äôs the story, anyway,  He turned away from the engineer in the studio there and faced the corner, like Little Jack Horner‚Äîas a matter of fact, I almost called this ‚ÄúLittle Jack Horner,‚Äù but it didn‚Äôt make much sense.
 Anyway, everyone thought the poor guy was just shy, or hiding his idiosyncratic playing style‚Äîwhich may be partly true‚Äîbut the real reason, so I‚Äôve read, is that he could get an interesting ‚Äúbounce‚Äù from the corner, sort of double-tracking his voice before that was ever heard of.
 So, I laid it down first just on this cassette player‚Äîreally‚Äîand then dumped it to a 16-track, played through a little reverb amp I had at the house.
 Stayed up all night doing that fucker.
 It was a full moon, I remember.
 It was beautiful.
 And at dawn, I brought it to Lorelei and said, baby, this is as good as Buddy gets.
 Is this interesting?
 CM:  	Sure.

 The man in black robes lifted his hand.
 Qurrah saw pale and bony fingers hooked in strange formations.
 Then came the fire, erupting as if those fingers were a crack releasing the melted rock of the abyss.
 The sudden light blinded them both.
 The fire burned through the orcs as a solid beam, melting their bodies and scattering their remains.
 When it struck the wooden gate, it exploded.
 Wood shattered.
 Guards behind the gate howled as molten rock struck them, piercing through their shields and armor.

The so-called ‚Äòshock therapy‚Äô strategy pursued by these countries has been widely criticized for its severity and seeming indifference to social costs.
 But debates regarding the appropriate speed and social cost of reforms divert attention from a more fundamental problem with this approach.
 The essence of shock therapy is a reliance on macro-economic factors to bring about a radical restructuring of the economy and a radical change in the behaviour of individuals and enterprises.
 While monetary policy may prove useful for dealing with short-term adjustment problems within a relatively stable environment, there is no evidence to support its use as the principle instrument for social transition.
 Monetary variables are indicators of the functioning of an economy, but the essential factors which determine the strength and health of an economy are the productivity of its enterprises and its workforce and the material resources of the country.
 Tight monetary policy can generate intense short-term pressure for change in behaviour, but this pressure is applied indiscriminately and often with unexpected and unanticipated results.
 The primary result of premature liberalization of prices was to encourage trade and speculation while discouraging production and investment.
 It distracted attention from fundamental changes in institutions and social attitudes needed for the transition to be successful.
 Macro-level policy measures have to be complemented and supported by parallel micro-level efforts to educate the population about the new economic system, to generate a free flow of information ‚Äì not just freedom, but the actual exchange of information, which is still severely limited in these countries ‚Äì to develop new distribution systems, to impart appropriate business and managerial skills, to provide access to credit, to build up new social institutions and to en courage and promote new enterprises.
 In most cities of the former Soviet Union, for instance, there is not a single whole sale market for food.

The elf whistled.
 From the night sky came the sound of soft wing beats.
 Then a white, winged horse swooped down, landing in front of Dieredon.
 ‚ÄúCome, Sonowin,‚Äù the elf said to his cherished companion.
 ‚ÄúLet us leave this place while it is still in peace.‚Äù
 The beautiful creature neighed in agreement.
 Dieredon mounted Sonowin, needing no reins or saddle.
 Antonil saluted the elf just before his mount leapt into flight.
 ‚ÄúStay safe, friend,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúYou as well, friend.‚Äù

If anyone knows where Oreintvenir is; it is Taiga‚Äù ‚ÄúMy lovely Gracella, you are an Immortalist of impressive power and intellect.
 But we are Immortalist, time is on our side and Grand Master Oreintvenir has been gone for less than a year.
 It is not unusual for one of his power to be gone for such a length of time.
 He could be anywhere on this world or beyond it.
 There is no need to be in such a... rush to ask questions.‚Äù ‚ÄúVan‚Äôdret doesn‚Äôt play your word games with me, you know, and I know that this is not a normal disappearance.
 Not with one of the great cosmic alignments coming in such a short time.
 Neither of us would be surprised if Taiga had killed him and taken his place.
 But, then he would simply have called a concave and be elected Guild Master if that was the case.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not suggesting that Taiga is involved in some foul play against the Grand Master are you?‚Äù asked Van‚Äôdret his tone equally outraged and surprised.
 Gracella almost physically jumped at the suggestion and could not help herself from a quick glance around the hall before responding.
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Taiga has any interest in becoming Guild Master, or he would be Guild Master.

Harruq had abandoned him, true, but perhaps he remained nearby, waiting for him.
 Then there was Velixar, no doubt furious at the elves‚Äô victory.
 Where did Karak‚Äôs prophet linger now that the battle had ended?
 There was only one way to find out.
 He would have to escape the town, regardless of the patrols that swarmed the area.
 He waited until nightfall.
 Even in the dark the elves still patrolled, carrying no torches for their keen eyes had no trouble seeing in the starlight.
 The longer he hid and watched, the more Qurrah was convinced they searched for him.
 The Neldaren troops were long gone, Harruq with them.
 He knew he was being paranoid, but the only other person they could be searching for was Velixar, and the elves were deluding themselves if they thought they could handle him.

Population, which was perceived as a liability not long ago, now appears to be an asset.
 In reality, population, like nuclear energy and so many other things, is neutral.
 Its value depends on what we human beings make of it.
 Changing Demographic Profile of the West: Demographic studies indicate that steep declines in the growth of population in Europe, Japan and USA will create acute labour shortages and unprecedented long-term demand for migration of foreign workers or transplantation of work to developing countries.
 UN and other studies estimate that Europe would have to accept 150 million new immigrants over the next 25 years in order to maintain the present levels of working population and Japan would need to admit 600,000 immigrants annually for the next 50 years in order to maintain the size of its working population at the 1995 level.
 The US labour force is projected to stop growing by 2013.
 These findings support the view of the India Vision 2020 report that ‚ÄúThis trend will further accelerate the outsourcing of production of goods and services to locations where infrastructure, ease of doing business, quality, costs and availability of labour are most attractive, which will be beneficial for many labour surplus countries like India.‚Äù
 Expanding World Trade: Trade is playing an increasing role in the economic growth of developing countries.
 Economic integration with the global economy has become a compelling necessity for every country.
 The share of trade in global GDP rose from 12 per cent in 1970 to 29 per cent in 2001.

‚ÄúYou lied to me, Velixar,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúYou said you were eternal.
 You said you held the power of a god.
 But you lied.
 You are nothing but dust.‚Äù
 Surrounded by fire and death, the half-orc stripped naked of his rags and donned the robes of his former master.
 Despite all the arrows and heat, they seemed in perfect condition.
 Even the stain of blood was already fading.
 Qurrah held the side of the hood to his mouth and coughed as the smoke grew ever thicker.
 ‚ÄúGoodbye, Velixar,‚Äù he said.

"See if they say anything about the possibilities of time travel and how you'd go about it."
 Marie found the articles fascinating .
 .
 .
 but unbelievable.
 Some were highly theoretical, suggesting that all times existed simultaneously but offering no suggestions on how to move through time.
 Some cited earlier experiments involving time machines.
 Some people claimed to have traveled into the past, but they had no real proof.
 If these scientists were so interested in time travel and believed they'd gone into the past, wouldn't they have known about people like her, people who'd come from the past into the future--their present?
 But there was no mention of that.

A loud crack from beside us made me jump.
 Alec looked at the branch, easily as thick as my arm, which he'd just torn from the tree we were leaning against.
 He stopped shaking as he considered what he'd done to the poor tree.
 "You're saying that because you're worried for me?
 Not because you really want to go back to him?"
 I shook my head, as confused by his reaction, by how close he'd come to losing control, as I was by my not having felt threatened.
 "No, I want to stay, but how can I knowing it will mean you're going to be fighting to the death?"
 Alec tossed the branch away with a sigh.
 "I've spent years learning control, but sometimes I still forget just how breakable everything around me is.
 If you go back to Brandon, you support his claim that you belong to him, and I'd still be forced to challenge him.

I expected annoyance, or possibly some of the disdain I'd endured off and on for the last forty-eight hours.
 I didn't get either.
 I couldn't really interpret the look, but he held my eyes for several seconds, until I finally looked away, my face heating up.
 I tried to run through the entire range of possible emotions, to pin that look down to something that made sense.
 It wasn't attraction, it'd been too neutral for that.
 Envy, fear, friendship, none of them fit.
 Whoever he was, he quietly left the room while my head was still whirling.
 I looked up to find Britney frowning at me.
 "What is your deal?
 I don't think I've ever seen Isaac notice anyone other than his girlfriend.

I actually kind of missed the feel of armed camps.
 My school hadn't been bad compared to some stories I'd heard from California, but there'd still been some kids beaten pretty severely for crossing the wrong group of wannabe gang members.
 Britney had a piece of pizza, and looked like she was eyeing a piece of cake until she noticed I was trailing along behind her without a tray of my own.
 She actually sighed as she passed the cake.
 The urge to giggle was so strong I uncapped my water bottle and turned slightly to the side in an attempt to disguise my amusement.
 It was one of those moments I'd try to reconstruct in my head again and again.
 I think I must have heard the cash register till close, or maybe Britney said something.
 Whatever the reason, I took a step in her direction while still looking away, my bottle half raised, and ran into the biggest junior I'd ever seen.
 My clumsiness would've been embarrassing enough all by itself.
 Unfortunately my mostly-full bottle of water splashed all over both of us.

‚ÄúWhat?
 What did you find?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I was just‚Ä¶ there was a thistle here‚Ä¶‚Äù It was all that had developed, the bulbs and seedlings were undisturbed, and I couldn‚Äôt help but think, Oh, sure, the weed grows.
 Junnie was across the room in a flash.
 She glanced at the changed thistle and then, briefly, me, but when I tried to meet her gaze, it shifted to the wall of books.
 ‚ÄúWell, good for you, Frey.
 Your efforts are finally paying off.‚Äù I stared blankly at her.
 ‚ÄúWhat do you say we wrap it up for today?
 I‚Äôve got some business with Council.‚Äù I stumbled off the stool, half numb from being still so long, and made my way outside into the warm sun, unsure of my direction.
 The idea of lingering within sight of the village center didn‚Äôt have much appeal, but I was in no hurry to get back home to Fannie.
 Choosing instead a rambling, rarely used path out of the village, I found myself wandering idly through the trees and, eventually, into an abandoned, overgrown garden, where I tried to work out what to do with my now empty afternoon.

But Rick had refused every time.
 She hoped that getting him to commit to the benefit dance would at least force him to ask someone out.
 She knew he was lonely, and she couldn‚Äôt stand seeing him shut himself off from any prospect of a relationship.
 Rick would probably have refused to go if he hadn‚Äôt met Sharon this weekend.
 He didn‚Äôt feel particularly attracted to her, but she was a nice girl, and that was a big improvement over his last few experiences.
 That evening he went out to the garden with the book Teri had given him.
 Sharon had been enthusiastic about the dance when he‚Äôd called to invite her.
 He‚Äôd told her he‚Äôd lend her the book, but she said that she already had some ideas about finding a drop-waist dress and a cloche hat.
 Personally, he thought the clothes were rather ugly.
 The dresses were shapeless, and the men‚Äôs pants were baggy.

It was bigger than the dragon we had rode.
 It had the body of a huge cockroach but its tail was a giant stinger.
 Large, bat wings were holding it up in the air.
 ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I asked.
 I turned to Emily and said, ‚ÄúEmily, you know anything about this creature?‚Äù She looked pale.
 ‚ÄúIt's saying, 'Kill half-lings, kill and eat.
 '‚Äú ‚ÄúWell, you better tell it that it's going to have to starve this time because it's not going to be eating anything,‚Äù Seth said confidently and held his sword out.
 She shook her head.
 ‚ÄúThere is no way that I'm going to say that.‚Äù ‚ÄúJazell, can you see its weakness?‚Äù Seth called to me.
 I squinted at the creature, and saw a dark circle under its belly.

 "Are you okay?"
 I shook my head.
 "This is going to be really bad, isn't it?"
 His silence validated my belief, probably even more than he realized.
 "I'd...we'd...spare you it if we could."
 It was my turn to shake my head.
 "No, this is my fault.
 I belong here, not cowering in a corner somewhere."
 Rachel hugged me from one side while Dominic placed a gentle, dark hand on my other shoulder, and then we were off.

I didn't want her to say anything she wasn't supposed to, especially not if Alec was having as hard of a time controlling the anger that seemed to be part and parcel of the new shapes everyone was wearing, but I was desperate to start understanding some of what was going on.
 Dominic must've looked away from the fight long enough to see the questions on my face.
 "It's hard to understand just how important the pack structure is.
 The question of who is dominant and who is subordinate drives so much of what we do.
 Even so, it's not nearly as bad as other packs, other places.
 Alec's established clear dominance to everyone else here, but he still probably couldn't make his gentler rules stick if it weren't for the fact that Isaac backs him almost without question."
 The object of our discussion was currently backing away from James while trying to keep Jessica from circling around behind him.
 I finally realized what I'd always thought of as grace was really an economy of motion.
 It was like he was saving every possible bit of energy because he never knew when he'd find it necessary to burn up his reserves in a blaze of violence.
 Even as I watched, he spun around, plucking Jessica out of the air, grabbing her by the head mid-leap as she sought to find purchase on this throat.

He remained wrapped in the blankets and sheets the two half-orcs had used to smuggle him out of his house.
 The wrappings provided a bit of relief against the growing smell of death that already permeated their home.
 ‚ÄúHis spirit will be bound to mine,‚Äù Qurrah said, sitting on his knees before the body.
 His eyes were closed and his hands atop Ahrqur‚Äôs head.
 ‚ÄúAny question you or I ask he must answer truthfully.
 Do not be disturbed by the sound he first makes.
 Spirits brought back into our world rarely enjoy the journey.‚Äù
 Harruq nodded, dressed in his black armor.
 They did not have much time before Velixar‚Äôs dark cloud arrived.
 They could not rush, but nor could they dawdle.

Not after everything else he'd already done for me.
 Guilting him into helping me more just felt wrong.
 He captured me in his iron grip, stopping me from getting up and running away.
 "Adriana Paige, it isn't that I don't want to be with you.
 I want it more than anything else right now.
 That's¬†why I'm not sure it's such a good idea."
 His face had somehow gotten so close to mine that I could see his eyes, and they were dead serious.
 I'd never noticed how clear his eyes were.
 They were the purest blue I'd ever seen, and looking into them was like trying to plumb the depths of a bottomless spring.
 I could see further into him than I ever could with Brandon, and there wasn't any deception there.

This first foe looked very young.
 He nodded to him like Rodregas should know him.
 Rodregas wondered if this man had been a friend of the previous occupant of his new body?
 He looked like he might speak, but Rodregas simply shook his head.

 Watchers were not allowed around the squares.
 Rodregas knew Imeralda and Doi‚Äôvan were atop the wall, the closest spot allowed for spectators.
 Two contestants had already fought.

Johnny ‚Äì What do you mean for the most part?
 Jim ‚Äì I think he tones it down some.
 I think he‚Äôs gone through worse than I can imagine.
 Johnny ‚Äì Why hasn‚Äôt he told anyone?
 Jim ‚Äì He doesn‚Äôt like to have people pitying him.
 At least that‚Äôs how I think he works.
 Johnny ‚Äì What does that have to do with anything?
 Jim ‚Äì If everyone knew about him it would change how the acted towards him.
 They would treat him like he was special and give him more lee-way.
 Johnny ‚Äì So, where‚Äôs the downside to that?

There's no reason to worry about a concussion."
 "Then why did you tell the sub I'd hit my head?"
 He looked away for a moment, almost as though deciding whether or not to tell the truth.
 "I presumed you wouldn't want to stay and be subject to everyone's questions.
 You seem not to like people prying about your attacks, and you were less happy than usual today.
 I thought you could use the break."
 Apparently he'd decided against the truth option.
 "I¬†looked unhappy today?
 You, who never crack a smile unless you're going to get something out of it, were concerned about the fact I wasn't all smiles and giggles?
 Maybe you should flunk a test or two.

The near total cessation of violence in North Ireland during the past 10 years is proof that rapid progress can be made on issues involving apparently intractable communal sentiments.
 This achievement appears astounding to those who lived through the earlier decades of religious violence and until recently found it nearly impossible to imagine a mitigation of the conflict in the foreseeable future.
 We would do well to examine closely this instance to draw lessons that may aid in addressing those conflicts that continue to defy resolution.
 The most striking lesson of the Irish experience is that rapid development absorbs and dissipates the urge for violence.
 The dramatic economic advancement of the Republic of Ireland ‚Äì whose per capita GDP rose within the past 20 years from less than 60 per cent that of UK to 95 per cent in dollar terms and 130 per cent in terms of purchasing power parity ‚Äì has eliminated the disparity between Ireland and Ulster and fostered among the Irish in both countries a sense of pride, an expansion of employment opportunities, and a more focused channelling of social energies into productive activities.
 Economic growth in the region was augmented by the systematic efforts of the British government to eliminate the active discrimination against the minority Catholic population of North Ireland in housing and employment as well as the segregation of Catholic and Protestant education.
 Violence has subsided, yet a political solution still defies the policymakers, because some of the root causes of the problem buried far in the past have not yet been adequately addressed.
 A steady and concerted effort for permanent solution in Ireland will demonstrate the possibility and provide the knowledge necessary for addressing other intractable communal problems around the world.
 A comprehensive approach to a permanent solution must include social, economic, education and cultural elements.
 The principle illustrated here is that long-standing military conflicts can be resolved by political initiative and obstinate political conflicts can be resolved by economic strategies rooted in the principles of equity and ethics.

"It's true then; he can't win."
 "While it isn't impossible, it's unlikely.
 Alec is a remarkable fighter, to hear Donovan speak of it, he's possibly even almost the equal of his father, but Brandon's strength and speed have not seen a match in centuries.
 It's likely Brandon will emerge the victor."
 Even though, or possibly exactly because it was what I'd suspected, the words sent slivers of ice through me.
 My heart seemed to be having a hard time maintaining a steady rhythm, but I forced myself not to give into the panic attack that was promising temporary relief from the horror of my life.
 With what I'd just been told, I should be able to put some of the pieces together.
 "Once Alec is dead, there'll be repercussions for everyone else?"
 Again the short, reluctant nod.
 I had so many questions I still wanted answered, but it didn't seem fair to get Isaac in any more trouble than he was already in.

But as Rodregas assumed no one had died, he had to smile.
 ‚ÄúIs it that bad?‚Äù he asked.
 Doi‚Äôvan missed his amused tone, or he was simply not in the mood to hear it.
 ‚ÄúThe news is not all good,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan agreed.
 Doi‚Äôvan grabbed the far too small stool beside the bed, which was the only other piece of furniture in the little dorm room that they had been assigned.
 Rodregas knew it was only due to his visitor status and having ‚Äòservants‚Äô that he had his own room, most squires would share housing during the tournament.
 Rodregas watched the stool curiously as Doi‚Äôvan sat to see if it would actually hold the massive weight of the Hellborn.
 His guess was that it would be crushed by the weight.
 To his surprise it held; though it gave a small groan at the weight.
 ‚ÄúWe counted over a hundred here for the melee, all are trained warriors.

 "Good.
 Do you want milk or juice or both?"
 They chatted as they ate, and only when she began loading the dishwasher did she remember that she was going to have to spend the day alone.
 "What should I do while you're gone, Rick?"
 "Whatever you like.
 You can see if I have any books that interest you, or you can watch television.
 There are frozen dinners in the freezer that you can put in the microwave for lunch.
 Just be sure to read the directions and remember not to put anything metal in it.

I clearly wasn‚Äôt welcome there.
 Neither spoke, so I lowered my gaze to the floor, taking the shortest route to Ruby‚Äôs door and closing it hastily behind me.
 Chevelle spoke to his guest and I groaned internally, wishing I‚Äôd heard their low voices earlier.
 Asher, as Chevelle had called the man, was apparently leaving.
 It sounded as if Chevelle was trying to persuade him in some way, but the man was short and cold in his responses.
 Quiet, too.
 I imagined he didn‚Äôt want me to hear them.
 Paranoia, my mind accused.
 I heard the front door close as I flopped onto the bed, only to jolt upright when Ruby‚Äôs door opened a few seconds later.
 It was Chevelle.

The way he talked was eerie and distressing, as if he meant to leave tomorrow and probably never come home.
 On his more effusive evenings, he might offer advice and wrest promises out of me.
 He asked for a promise that I would go straight to college, because a guy as smart as me simply ought to, and it would please my mom, who could use some cheering after her sorrows.
 He had witnessed how any talk of college made her glow.
 Besides, he didn‚Äôt want to see me get drafted.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd have a hell of a time in the service,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúA teacher barks at you, it‚Äôs all you can do not to punch the guy.
 Think of what‚Äôd happen with a drill sergeant.
 You‚Äôd spend all your time locked up.‚Äù Twice he made me promise to watch over Billy, to be like a big brother, since Billy wouldn‚Äôt have him anymore.
 I said, ‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt he have you anymore?‚Äù ‚ÄúI mean after I‚Äôm gone.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre still here,‚Äù I said.

 She turned and threw her arms around him.

I was staying bound.
 I let out a frustrated growl, clenching my jaw shut.
 He was one of them.
 I had to remember that.
 I might have run back to the village right then, but they would never release me.
 I had nothing.
 I glanced down the mountainside.
 I couldn‚Äôt have found my way back if I‚Äôd wanted to.
 I had no idea where I was.
 I stared at my palms, some spell-bought map carved into my skin, and was hit full force with the knowledge that I didn‚Äôt even know where I was going.

And poems, typed and tacked to the wall.
 I remember one, in particular, an Aztec poem, and it began, ‚ÄúRejoice, rejoice, my flower king, you own many jewels‚Äî‚Äú and I thought, wow, that‚Äôs for me, man.
 It was an egotistical reaction, I know.
 Where ‚ÄúFlower King‚Äù comes from.
 And there were these little altars she had constructed, with tiny clay figures and candles.
 And the floor‚Äîwhat there was of it (laughs)‚Äîlike I say, was awash in album covers and books.
 Books stacked in these tottering towers.
 Names I‚Äôd never heard of, at that time: Kis, Malcolm Lowry, Svevo, Madame Blavatsky, Fludd, Dee, Goncharov, Bruno Schulz, Philip Wylie, Whatsername Yates, Blake, Maturin, Borges, Marie-Louise von Franz,  a book called History of Secret Societies, one, I think called On the conjuring of angels.
 It was mind-boggling.
 The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage.

‚ÄúHello girls, come in.
 Emily, dear, can you put your laundry away?
 After you do that, you can hang out in your room.‚Äù Emily nodded and disappeared inside.
 Her mom moved aside so I could walk in.
 I unlaced my sneakers and walked up the stairs, looking at the flower paintings hung along the wall that her mom had painted in her spare time.
 I pushed open Emily‚Äôs bedroom door to see her stuffing her clothes in the drawer and flopping onto the bed.
 She pulled out my bag and threw it to me so I could set up my sleeping bag on her rug.
 Her mom called us downstairs, hopefully for food.
 She held a box of pizza.
 ‚ÄúYou two can eat upstairs or down here.‚Äù She already knew our answer and handed us paper plates.

His shoulder pounded with each heartbeat; his chest screamed with each breath.
 Colors swam across his eyes.
 His ears, incredibly sensitive even compared to other elves, strained for the sound of approaching dead.
 He heard nothing but a strange ringing inside his skull.
 It seemed he had put more distance between them than he first thought.
 A footstep fell beside his head.
 His heart and lungs halted.
 The pain had diminished his skills.
 They were atop him, but he dared not move.
 He sent a silent prayer to Celestia as more footfalls clomped all around him.

But he knew he could make her happy if she stayed here with him.
 She was everything he'd ever wanted in a woman, and he couldn't bear the thought of losing her.
 Surely it would be easier to convince her to stay now that she'd decided not to marry Davis.
 He knew she was extremely attracted to him.
 Her response to him this afternoon had been passionate and unrestrained.
 And now he knew that when she'd said that she couldn't do it, she hadn't been talking about making love with him but about marrying Davis.
 And if he made love to her, she'd feel tied to him and be more likely to stay.
 If he slowly increased the heat of his kisses and caresses, made her so hot that she stopped thinking altogether, made her so wild with desire .

The first half of Rachel's comment finally sank in, and I nearly tripped.
 "Wait, what dance?"
 "Ashure Day.
 It's an...a local tradition.
 Think of it kind of like earth day, but with a dance.
 Kind of like a pagan Prom.
 Or maybe a pagan homecoming since it's still fall."
 Prom was my arch-nemesis.
 There were really only two times a year that the universe managed to penetrate my historical indifference to the opposite sex.
 Prom, and Valentine's Day.

Then who‚Äôs going to pay for the banquet, for all this freedom?‚Äù
 A Big Change
 Though I continued to long for Karen Flagstad, I began to roam.
 For some months after meeting Gloria at the San Onofre campground, I frequently drove to South Gate, just south of L.A., a hundred miles each way, to feast on her grandmother‚Äôs cooking, get scrutinized by her dad and brothers, take her to drive-in movies and smooch until her midnight curfew, then race home so fast the sleepy cops along Highway 101 failed to notice the blur as I passed.
 But Mexican dads like hers expect their girls‚Äô novios to marry or que se vayan a la fregada.
 Meaning scram.
 And after the second time I chose North Beach over her company, Gloria informed me her former boyfriend had returned on leave from the Marines.
 We shouted at each other long-distance and parted.

Rodregas tentatively touched the book and it buzzed slightly of magic.
 It held no foulness so he tossed it into the trunk.
 He added the coin purses to the robe he was wearing.
 He still needed more hard money and some decent clothes.
 Rodregas looked out the window to see a few people leaving the keep grounds, and a few still hanging around the yard.
 He knew he could not leave without everyone seeing him.
 He searched the rest of the study in the daylight.
 He found nothing of real use until he pulled a drawer completely out of the desk and found a false back to the drawer.
 He found it was holding a purple silk purse containing eight pieces of gold and two of silver.
 Now he had the money he needed to be on the run.

Acknowledgments I would like to thank all of the drug and alcohol rehabilitation professionals who choose to tackle the daunting task of attempting to help those in this world who cannot take just one drink but must consume the whole bottle and those who cannot take a prescription pill as prescribed but must crush, snort, smoke or inject these powerful drugs to feed the monster of addiction.
 Many of these counselors and staff who help the addicts in our lives were once addicts themselves.
 They choose to ‚Äúgive back‚Äù because they have either finally come to understand what caused them to want to destroy themselves and are compelled to share this knowledge or they know that they can only continue their sobriety by staying where they found it, or both.
 Either way, they are the students who became the teachers of recovery and only they are bullet proof to the lies that flow so freely from an addict‚Äôs mouth.
 I would like to thank the staff of Narconon and every other facility that helps our addicts attempt to identify and handle the demon they cannot resist.
 I would like to thank Chris Tillman for encouraging me to turn my cathartic writings into a book to share my story with others.
 I would like to thank my mother for being the best mother she could be despite astronomical obstacles that faced a single parent in the 60‚Äôs with no financial support from her first husband and an abusive second husband.
 Mom, we never knew how hard life was for you because you made sure we came first and you protected us the best you could!
 To my son Bryce, I would like to thank you for all of your accomplishments and helping me as a father not have a complete melt down because at least I knew I wasn‚Äôt a complete failure as a Dad.
 You gave me the hope and courage to continue to try to understand your brother and his drug addiction and eventually the addiction of others.

Men of the east no longer trust the elves, and the elves hold little love for our beloved King.
 Of course, thousands died, but what is a little sacrifice compared to such gains?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúThey joined your army, didn‚Äôt they, necromancer?‚Äù Dieredon asked.
 Velixar laughed.
 ‚ÄúYou are wise, elf, and you are strong, but you have sheltered arrogance.‚Äù
 The man in black stood, pulling the hood back from his face.
 His eyes shone a blinding red.
 His face was a pale skull covered with dead gray skin.
 Maggots crawled through the flesh, feasting.
 Dieredon delayed his attack, stunned by the horrific sight.

Disclaimer
 Due to the diversity and complexity of the views examined by the Commission, and the heterogeneous mix of Commission members drawn from a wide range of countries, backgrounds and professions, it has not been possible to arrive at consensus on all the views discussed in this report.
 Five years of research and discussion have created a much greater commonality of perspective, but there are still significant differences among members regarding specific views and recommendations presented in this report.
 However, all the Commissioners agree with the basic emphasis on social and gender equity, job-led growth and human security.
 Members share the conviction that a candid and challenging discussion of these issues is more valuable than representation of a consensus view.
 The Next Millennium
 We are on the threshold of a new millennium.
 All civilizations have recognized the special significance of new beginnings ‚Äì the dawn of a new day, a new year, a new century.
 These are moments of new birth when fresh vision and greater energy are available for setting out in a new direction or accelerating progress along our chosen course.
 The dawn of a new millennium brings with it a tremendous power for renewal and advancement.

 Indeed it is.
 Which is odd since Eugene seems to love Johnny like he was his own little brother.
 Art ‚Äì What irony, if I wasn‚Äôt hip-deep in it, maybe it wouldn‚Äôt make me want to cry.
 Jim ‚Äì Maybe we‚Äôll get lucky.
 Art ‚Äì How so?
 Jim ‚Äì Maybe on the way home today we‚Äôll get into a terrible flaming car wreck and get ourselves rather dead.
 Art ‚Äì How is that lucky?
 Jim ‚Äì It‚Äôs not, but it defiantly beats going home and telling Johnny that Gene is soon to be a member of the family.

Onlookers cackled as they passed, figuring the two were thieves or vagrants caught brawling.
 Their orcish features lent them no kindness, and a few children even threw rocks until the guards shooed them away.
 The whole while Harruq burned with shame and rage.
 They reached the western gate, which remained open during the day.
 Without ceremony, they were kicked through, both falling to the dirt and scraping their knees.
 ‚ÄúGet going,‚Äù one said.
 ‚ÄúSee if somewhere else will take your mutt ass.‚Äù
 It was not just adrenaline that caused Harruq‚Äôs hands to shake, but Qurrah put his hand on his wrist and begged him to calm.
 ‚ÄúNever forget this shame,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúLet it burn in you.

Finally, just before nightfall, he approached a small village.
 It didn‚Äôt look like more than half a dozen structures scattered against the base of a large hill.
 He dropped the simple pack he‚Äôd been carrying beside a tree and hunched down as he slowed his pace.
 The stance mirrored mine, and gave me pause.
 He was sneaking into this village.
 I watched as he crept around the back of a small hut, knowing that if he was hiding, I definitely didn‚Äôt want to get caught here.
 He leapt into a rear window and I followed as low and slow as I could.
 When I reached the last tree I could use for cover, I darted up against the hut and peered through a gap in the twigs that patched it together.
 They were whispering.
 ‚Äú‚Ä¶ mustn‚Äôt let them find you‚Ä¶ shouldn‚Äôt have come‚Ä¶‚Äù It was dim inside, but I caught a glimpse of a figure through the wall.

And I was managing Cody‚Äôs Little League team, hoping he might become a pitcher instead of a ninja.
 Probably because I didn‚Äôt sleep enough, my emotions had shut down, and every day I sensed impending doom.
 Something had to change.
 My kids didn‚Äôt deserve a catatonic dad.
 One late afternoon as I sat on the grass at the University of San Diego, overlooking the harbor and wondering how I could fix my emotions, I mumbled, ‚ÄúOkay, where should I start?‚Äù Then I remembered advice Master Jeong, our Tae Kwon Do instructor, often gave.
 He told us, "Everything begins with the spirit.
 From the spirit come the thoughts.
 From the thoughts come the actions.
 From the actions come the habits.
 From the habits comes the character.

The officers continued to hold their ground and refused to agree to work with me.
 I pushed: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to work with me.
 I just want to know what you would do if I contacted you and told you that Steve was meeting me to buy one-hundred Oxys?
 What is your job responsibility in that case?‚Äù ‚ÄúWe would do our job if someone called and informed us of a drug deal,‚Äù Officer White said.
 ‚ÄúIf I am able to get Steve busted, would that count for my son‚Äôs deal?‚Äù I asked.
 The officer and his sergeant left the room for about ten minutes before returning to tell me that it would.
 ‚ÄúWe are not condoning or encouraging this in any way,‚Äù Officer White insisted.
 That was all I needed.
 Now Brandon and I would need to work out the rest.

Several homes, those with their doors smashed open, had gore smeared on their floors.
 One pained Dieredon‚Äôs heart greatly; amid a great red circle on a wooden floor laid a small, bloodstained doll.
 He said a silent prayer before moving on.
 At the edge of the town, he found many frantic tracks fleeing west.
 He followed them, wincing as some ended in dried smears of red upon the grass.
 Others led far past the others.
 They ended at once in an enormous pool of blood, leaving the town a somber image in the distance.
 Chasing them the whole while were twin sets of tracks, one of enormous weight, the other light as a feather.
 ‚ÄúEvery one of them,‚Äù he said, his hand clutching his bow so tight his knuckles were whiter than the moon.
 ‚ÄúThey slaughtered even those that fled.

I made an effort to consider possible responses in my head, but was coming up blank.
 The nerves were gone.
 I found myself wanting Steed to win and leaned with his strikes, tensing as if they were my own.
 Grey bounded through the air once more, showing off, confident in his evident lead, and then a small rock rose at chest height in front of Steed.
 I was trying to figure out who had lifted it when Grey flashed back into view, hesitating only a moment as he considered the rock.
 At once, his face changed; he knew he‚Äôd been beaten.
 As he‚Äôd paused to study the floating rock, Steed had immobilized him and, just like that, the match was over.
 Ruby leaned into me, voice soft.
 ‚ÄúSteed is stronger than Grey.
 He only needed to catch him.‚Äù Grey conceded, his walk slower, movements no longer jerky as he made his way out of the makeshift ring.

The idea that most of these jobs could be created in the corporate sector or by government-sponsored activities has been put to rest.
 Currently, there are nearly one billion self-employed and unpaid family workers in the world, most of them self-employed farmers in developing countries.
 The self-employed represent 48 per cent of the workforce in low-income economies (less than $500 per capita GDP).
 For any strategy to be successful, it must give central importance to self-employment and entrepreneurship, with emphasis on agriculture, agro-industry and small firms in the informal sector.
 While a single approach will not be applicable to countries and regions of the world in different stages of development, a number of common principles and strategies are widely applicable.
 Agriculture as an engine
 Slightly more than half the world‚Äôs workforce, of whom 30 per cent are women, are still engaged in agriculture.
 Agriculture will remain the largest single occupation for the foreseeable future.
 For too long this sector has been regarded by planners primarily as the source of essential food production.
 Historically, agriculture has also played a major role as an engine for economic growth and employment.

‚ÄúHow will I know where this Ahrqur lives?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI will show you, my disciple, but first I have a gift for my dearest bone general.‚Äù
 Velixar drew out his magical chest.
 He set it beside him and let it grow out to normal size.
 From within he pulled out a suit of armor stained a deep shade of black.
 He threw it to Harruq, who managed to catch it even though his mouth hung wide open.
 ‚ÄúThe first Horde War was caused by a disciple of mine,‚Äù the man in black explained.
 ‚ÄúHe blessed the armor of one of the leaders of the orcish clans.
 I claimed it when he fell on the battlefield.‚Äù
 Harruq examined the suit, turning it over in his hands.

 she'd thought it would be something pleasant.
 Was the harshness of his kiss indicative of what sex would be like?
 She couldn't sleep that night.
 After tossing and turning for hours, she got up and took a long bath.
 By the time she'd dressed, it was dawn.
 She was restless, but she didn't know what she wanted to do.
 Finally she decided to go for a walk in the garden to see if the quiet stroll would help her sort out her thoughts and feelings.
 Davis seemed like a different man since they'd become betrothed.

It went against everything past experience with Mrs. Tiggs had taught me, but I almost believed her.
 Chapter 26 It was amazing how quickly my classes flew by when I had a friend, or at least a protector, with me at all times.
 Then again all of Monday had flown by, not just the school portion of the day, so it really shouldn't have been a surprise today was doing likewise.
 After Spanish, Jasmin had escorted me to Mrs. Campbell's class.
 Telling her I wasn't going to be able to help out at the lab anymore had been one of the harder things I'd ever done, but she'd been surprisingly understanding.
 We'd scheduled my makeup test for the next day and I'd left with the sneaking suspicion she'd guessed more about what was really going on in Sanctuary than either pack would've liked.
 I'd been busy contemplating what Mrs. Campbell might have really figured out as we left the building, only to have Jasmin interrupt my musings with an apology of all things.
 She didn't get into specifics, and it was obvious she was still worried about the coming showdown with Brandon, but I was pretty sure she really was sorry.
 It didn't make us best friends and she was still an enigma, but it was a start.
 It even gave me hope maybe Jessica and James might eventually come around.

 "Thanks--you're terrific.

We‚Äôre going to dress up in period clothes and dance the Charleston.
 It‚Äôs going to be a lot of fun.‚Äù ‚ÄúHmmm.‚Äù ‚ÄúReally.
 I‚Äôm going to drop a book off at your office some time today.
 It‚Äôs got pictures of people from the ‚Äò20s, so you can get an idea of how to dress.‚Äù ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt we still having dinner Thursday?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah.
 But I don‚Äôt want you to use not having enough time to plan as an excuse.‚Äù  In the last few months, she‚Äôd tried to fix him up two or three times.
 Whenever she showed a friend a picture of her gorgeous brother, the girl would immediately ask to be set up.
 But Rick had refused every time.
 She hoped that getting him to commit to the benefit dance would at least force him to ask someone out.
 She knew he was lonely, and she couldn‚Äôt stand seeing him shut himself off from any prospect of a relationship.
 Rick would probably have refused to go if he hadn‚Äôt met Sharon this weekend.

It didn‚Äôt work to bring Brandon back.
 I warned and warned, but no matter how much I warned him, he continued his journey to the dark side.
 He was over six feet tall and weighed less than 140 pounds.
 He was sickly, late to every family event and completely high when and if he showed up.
 He was a constant embarrassment at large family gatherings as he was the last to show and the first to go.
 When our Chevelle was ready for its maiden voyage, he was a no show.
 I delayed starting the car for hours, expecting he might be late, but he never showed.
 That car started for the first time since I had taught the boys to drive, and Brandon missed this moment because drugs were now more important to him than anything or anybody.
 I looked at photos of Brandon growing up and wondered if I would view them in a slideshow at his funeral.
 My marriage suffered because Lisa defended Brandon vehemently; I completely understood, because I had grown up with a similar scenario: my mother‚Äôs unwillingness to see Thomas‚Äôs problem.

But, he came home every night with a grin on his face.
 Ate dinner with us, spot on 4:45, like you could set your fucking watch by it, and then, evenings when he played, he‚Äôd sheepishly pick up his little case, which usually sat in the back closet next to his shoe tree, and he would toss off a sad smile and go play till God knows what hour.
 And Mom would sit and stew.
 That was her m√©tier.
 Stewing.
 Sad stuff, really.
 Don‚Äôt want to think about it.
 CM: 	Your mother disapproved of music?
 Was it a religious thing?
 BG:  	No, no, I don‚Äôt think so.

Me, the person who never won anything, was going to get to see the greatest musical of all time.
 I smiled and thanked everyone who yelled back congratulations, and then turned to find Alec staring at me.
 "Congratulations, Adriana.
 Les Mis√©rables is one of the best.
 I hope you enjoy it."
 I thanked him sweetly, and even managed a smile, but I wanted to tell him he was a jerk.
 I'd been desperate to win a ticket, and he had to take yet another opportunity to rub in the fact that he'd already seen it.
 That he was rich enough to see it anywhere in the world as often as he wanted to.
 Even my desire to tell Alec off wasn't strong enough to overcome the pure joy at having won.
 The next two hours floated by, and before I would've believed it possible, I found myself heading towards the tutoring lab.

Apparently Alec's presence was proof against a second near attack today.
 "I don't know.
 We always used to do the standard kind of stuff.
 Presents, eggnog and the Christmas story.
 Usually Dad made us breakfast Christmas morning and then we'd drive out of the city later in the day and go sledding.
 I hadn't thought about what it would be like this year."
 Alec nodded like he'd just checked a box off on some kind of mental list.
 "So snow's always been a pretty key ingredient sounds like."

Enforcement should be made mandatory and automatic.
 At the same time, it must be recognized that force alone can never eliminate these problems at their roots.
 Aggressive energies must be given constructive channels through which to express themselves positively in economic development.
 Unless and until famine and poverty are eliminated, both in developing countries and in the inner cities of the North, these energies will continue to find negative expression through violence.
 Therefore, a comprehensive approach is called for.
 The measures proposed here must be viewed in conjunction with recommendations made elsewhere in this report to eradicate hunger and unemployment.
 Linkages to commodity trade
 Isolated and independently pursued policies, which appeared highly beneficial at the time enacted, often result in unexpected and unwanted consequences that negate the benefits of the original measures.
 The refusal of high-income nations to meet the demands of developing countries for protection of commodity prices is an example.
 During the 1980s, the debt crisis forced many developing countries to increase exports of basic commodities ‚Äì often at great cost to the environment ‚Äì in an effort to make loan repayments.

I managed a single step before my knees collapsed and the ground jumped up to meet me.
 Consciousness was slow returning.
 When my eyes finally fluttered open, I was surprised to find myself in Alec's arms once again.
 "Are you okay?"
 He tried to set me down, to stand me up on my feet, but I grabbed onto him as tightly as my shaking arms were able.
 "Don't leave me.
 Please don't make me go."
 I didn't realize I was crying until I tried to talk.
 It was embarrassing, but was I too worried about being sent away to care.
 Any amount of ridicule would be worthwhile if it meant being able to stay with Alec.

Most of these others are powerful and dangerous, but a Bunei is more than a simple fighter of the Infernals.
 I am actually surprised to see they‚Äôre with the other beasts.
 I thought them a type of Greater Daemon.
 I think I might see what happens when I touch it,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan said.
 ‚ÄúIs that wise?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 He was not challenging him.
 Doi‚Äôvan was clearly asking himself the same thing.
 He looked over at Rodregas and shrugged.
 ‚ÄúWe both have the power of the Infernal Realm in us.
 Is it easier for us to manage following the path of righteousness to let the power burn free or to take on the form of a greater sigil and bind the Infernal magic to a specific form?

Perhaps more than any other institution, the military has under stood and demonstrated the enormous power of organization to accomplish a goal.
 The Gulf War was a dramatic illustration of the importance of reliable information, perfect planning, logistical support systems, effective chains of command and swift responsiveness to changing situations.
 If humankind could mobilize and apply the same efficiency to the war on poverty and unemployment that it has exhibited in preparing for and waging military wars against each other, very soon there would be no more poverty or unemployment to fight.
 During the Second World War Ford Motors converted from manufacture of cars for the masses to making trucks and airplanes for the military, producing B-24 bombers at the rate of one per hour from a single production plant.
 If conversion from civilian to military production could be carried out by so many countries within one or two years, it must be possible to convert the military from war-based to peace-based applications, and defence industries from military to civilian production, within half a decade.
 That requires human resourcefulness in organizational innovation.
 Organization is the means by which people work together cooperatively to achieve common goals and, in the process, to serve society in a wide range of functions.
 The achievement of food security and full employment depends on the establishment of new types of public and private organizations ‚Äì commercial, financial, industrial, export, research, educational and training.
 These institutions are needed to encourage, support, standardize, regulate and control development activities.
 New institutions lie behind the success of most major development achievements.

‚ÄúPlus I‚Äôm not evil, so why shouldn‚Äôt I help you out?‚Äù ‚ÄúUh thanks I guess.‚Äù This situation was extremely awkward to me.
 She winked and disappeared in a flash.
 I limped over to my body ignoring Seth‚Äôs yells to tell me to sit down.
 I felt the wind pick up and was whisked back to my normal self.
 I felt fine except for the fact it hurt to stretch my left side.
 I would probably be extremely stiff and sore tomorrow morning, but I was used to that feeling.
 We began to walk back towards the park when Jason stopped us.
 ‚ÄúHey can Seth and I catch you guys later?
 We have something to do.‚Äù Jason grabbed Seth and they took off.
 Emily raised an eyebrow, ‚ÄúShould we be concerned?‚Äù ‚ÄúNah they‚Äôre boys, let them do what they have to do,‚Äù I said with a quick sigh.

Translucent silver crept about the wraps.
 Blue smoke floated into the air.
 The blue and silver grew thicker and thicker.
 Qurrah‚Äôs words grew louder, more powerful, and then Ahrqur‚Äôs spirit ripped into the air, a glowing blue-silver form of insanity.
 The spirit looked much as he did in life, except his clothes were different.
 They were silvery robes, beautiful and decadent.
 The spirit wailed.
 It took all of Harruq‚Äôs strength to resist the urge to cover his ears.
 ‚ÄúCease such nonsense,‚Äù Qurrah ordered.
 The spirit immediately hushed.

I only knew from the strain on my legs we were heading up, climbing higher into the gray sky and biting wind.
 Chevelle rode beside me through the day.
 When we stopped for the evening, he pulled me down from my horse and stayed near as we sat on large stones around a fire.
 Ruby was telling stories again and everyone gave her their full attention‚Ä¶ everyone but us.
 ‚ÄúHow do you feel?‚Äù he asked.
 I shrugged.
 ‚ÄúFine, I guess.‚Äù He seemed unusually concerned.
 He was also sitting unusually close.
 He spoke in a low voice, though the others didn‚Äôt appear to be listening.
 I had to strain to hear.

‚ÄúThere were good men and evil men in his abyss after the war.
 The punishment was not to be eternal, not then, but Celestia chose Ashhur over my master.‚Äù Qurrah watched as Velixar‚Äôs hands clenched so tight his nails dug deep into his skin.
 Flesh tore, but no blood surfaced.
 ‚ÄúShe took all who were good out of the abyss and gave their care to Ashhur.
 Left with nothing but thieves and murderers, Karak had no choice but to make it eternal.
 The abyss is dark, Qurrah, and there is fire, but there is also order.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWhat do you wish of me?‚Äù Qurrah asked.
 Velixar‚Äôs face softened into a dark smile.
 ‚ÄúTo fight the war.
 Celestia may have condemned it to continue forever, but she slumbers now.

Steed was watching me, smiling appreciatively, and I realized I was wearing a huge grin.
 And about three pounds of mud.
 The slower pace gave me time to take everything in.
 The ground had leveled off again, clearing to open meadows of low grass and a few scattered trees.
 Large gray rocks dotted the landscape.
 There was a haziness on the horizon but as we rode it began to clear, revealing a mammoth lake ahead.
 It was a hundred times bigger than the tiny forest ponds I was used to, as smooth as glass.
 Behind it the haze thinned just enough I could see the outline of mountains.
 The image was like a punch in the chest.
 Chevelle rode up beside us.

Because he really doesn't think he can win?"
 Mallory pondered for several seconds, before finally shrugging.
 "That may be unduly pessimistic.
 He's detail-oriented enough that part of it's probably just an insurance policy for me in case he doesn't prevail, but there is a kernel of truth to your concern.
 Alec is an incredible fighter, but Brandon's like hasn't been seen in centuries."
 "Why are you telling me all this?
 I've been with the others for almost two whole weeks, and nobody's hinted that there were hybrids with special powers."
 Mallory patted my hand again.
 "I probably wouldn't have complicated things this way save for the fact that for only the third time in my long life, I've looked inside a human, and seen something outside of the ordinary there."

He thanked staff members and students by name, as he looked them directly in the eyes.
 He made amends to all of us and he unsuccessfully tried to fight back the tears as he continued.
 He spoke candidly about all of the lessons he had learned to help him deal with a life without the need for drugs.
 He talked about how he had learned to deal with the nightmares and guilt he once drowned in drugs.
 I never thought such words of wisdom and reflection would ever come out of his mouth but they did.
 We all sobbed uncontrollably as we could now understand what demons he fought and how our son was back.
 We could finally understand drug addiction.
 A group hug involving our entire family erupted during the ceremony as Brandon finished speaking.
 I am sure nobody minded the interruption, as those in all phases of the program were witnessing the healing of a family.
 Perhaps it gave them hope as well, and the thought that one day they could hold their loved ones and heal the hurt they had caused.

As I let go, I realized I‚Äôd gotten blood on my hands, so I headed to the hall and poured water from the pitcher into a ceramic basin.
 Staring into the mirror was not my favorite pastime.
 It mostly made my head hurt.
 But I had to clean the blood from my face and straighten the nest of hair on my head.
 When I leaned forward, a flash caught my eye.
 For a moment I thought the pendant was reflecting light from somewhere in the dark hallway, but my brain must have been still muddled from sleep.
 I examined the stone closer and saw blood had gotten smudged there as well, so I rinsed it clean.
 I lingered there, clutching it tight in my hand.
 It was a comfort to hold.
 It seemed to warm something deep within me.

My being asked out had changed my treatment from almost every girl at school.
 Half the student body, the more sensible portion it seemed, had all decided that I was some kind of massively stuck-up slut.
 The other half had decided they needed to be my new best friend if they wanted to get invited to any of the cool parties ever again.
 It might not have bothered me except the girls who now hated me were the ones I generally would've gotten along with, at least as much as I ever got along with anyone.
 My leaving Brandon's insane bouquet of flowers at the office instead of lugging it around all day should have helped.
 Apparently they all either thought it was a ploy, or were just too stupid to get the message that I didn't want to jump on the popularity bandwagon.
 Whatever the reason, I'd gotten three invitations to assorted parties or other activities before school ended.
 I even got another two as I hobbled back from the office with my roses, which had decreased during their stay there by exactly the number of office ladies.
 I'd politely declined each invitation, citing my need to catch up in Biology and Spanish, and made it to tutoring without further mishap.
 Another usher, this one thankfully no more fawning than the first, pointed me towards my seat, and I felt my second surge of disappointment for the night.

 She played with a curl on his forehead.
 He turned away from her hand, so she tickled his ear with her fingernail.
 His eyes finally opened, and he blinked up at her, smiling lazily.
 "Good morning."
 "Good morning."
 "Time to go walking in the garden?"
 "No--it's too late for that.

Education is the process by which society passes on the accumulated knowledge and experience of countless centuries to new generations in a systematic, concentrated and abridged form, so that today‚Äôs young people can start their lives at the high point of knowledge and wisdom attained by preceding generations.
 Education replaces the slow, subconscious process of trial and error learning with a swift, conscious process.
 This accumulated knowledge is a great power that can be utilized to accelerate human development and abridge the time needed for society to arrive at progressively higher levels of material, social and psychological fulfilment.
 Despite the massive efforts of international institutions to create awareness of the vital role of education in peace, democracy, economic development, population control and environmental protection, progress on extending the benefits of education to all humankind is still grossly inadequate.
 In 1990, 948 million people or about 20 per cent of the entire world population lacked even basic literacy skills.
 Adult literacy rates in the least developed nations still average less than 50 per cent and are less than half that in a number of countries.
 Unless more intensive efforts are made, worldwide the absolute number of the illiterate will decline only marginally by the year 2000.
 Illiteracy is likely to increase by 10 per cent in South Asia ‚Äì home to more than 40 per cent of the world‚Äôs illiterate ‚Äì and by nearly 7 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa.
 Although universal primary education has been a goal for decades and primary education has been made compulsory in most countries, 128 million children living in remote rural areas, urban slums and refugee camps ‚Äì representing 20 per cent of the total school-age population ‚Äì are still excluded from primary education.
 Unless greater measures are introduced, this number may rise to more than 160 million by the turn of the century.

Now I would need to go home and hope my wife‚Äôs level of understanding would allow me to be completely honest with her about what I was doing, and what I had just done.
 I knew Lisa wanted to help Brandon and we both knew my involvement would require a venture into unchartered territory but I needed her to know everything.
 Lisa and I had been married for twenty-four years and we knew what lay ahead would be a bigger test of our commitment than what I had just done.
 We needed to help Brandon and I needed to believe this would also help the kids I was attempting to bust, just as my son getting busted was one step closer to hitting bottom, and hopefully one step closer to getting off of these powerful drugs.
 There was no turning back now.
 Before I got home from my massage, my crack-berry phone rang and it was Ashley.
 She called me to ask if I could bring her a few Oxys to hold her over for the night.
 I, of course, didn‚Äôt have any Oxys so I told her I couldn‚Äôt get out and we could do the whole deal at once.
 I couldn‚Äôt help but feel sorrow for her and guilt for what I was doing but I justified it in my mind that she needed to get away from this guy and that she needed to get help for her drug problem as well.
 I pictured my son and his willingness to do anything to get his next fix.

 BG:  	Me, too.
 As you know, I‚Äôve gone out of my way to squelch such things‚Äîany artist would.
 Except maybe Zappa who seems to embrace the concept of bootleg albums.
 Pete has gone after a few people, but these succubi who produce such things are like mercury.
 You think you have them pinned down and they squirt away.
 CM:  	What‚Äôs on it, and how did these recordings get circulated?
 BG: 	 Well, the how is easy.
 Tapes get stolen, recorders are snuck into concerts.
 From what I‚Äôve seen this puppy is about half live and half rejected studio takes.

So I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs time we ask ourselves if living more like Olga Savitsky wouldn‚Äôt be preferable to the way we are living.
 Olga is a minimalist.
 Though plenty educated (holding a Master of City Planning degree) and able to follow a more lucrative career, she chooses to work cleaning houses.
 She shares an apartment and pays less than $400 for rent and utilities, in a pleasant neighborhood near a commercial district.
 On most of her errands, she can walk.
 When she needs to drive, she uses her 1994 Toyota Tercel.
 She tells me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like a sacrifice.
 I just don‚Äôt need much.
 A person with a family needs more than I do.
 Usually what somebody needs depends upon their function.

I kept catching glimpses of the characteristic soft glow out of the corner of my eye, but hadn't ever actually slipped into a full-blown dream.
 It'd left me feeling very unsatisfied.
 I rolled over and pulled the note out from its hiding place in my dresser.
 I had the words memorized already; the symbol was what I wanted now.
 The note was proof of the existence of our benefactor, but the sigil on the bottom of the page was a clue to his identity.
 It was incredibly intricate and completely different than anything I'd ever seen.
 Once again I traced the sharp edges and smooth swirls with my eyes, marveling at the way it hinted at further complexity lurking just out of sight.
 With a sigh of resignation I hid the note once again and pulled myself out of bed.
 Convinced as I was that Brandon was our benefactor, I no longer felt any qualms about trusting him to come pick me up.
 I waited in the living room until I saw him pull up, and then skipped out to meet him with a smile.

For the first time true anger was in his words, ‚ÄúYou do not know what you are getting in the middle of.
 You are barely more than a squire and yet you would get in a battle of beings so much greater than you?‚Äù The Immortalist went from anger to laughter, but his laughter did not last long.
 His laughter was like all things Immortalist, beautiful but cold.
 When it ended he said simply, ‚ÄúTime for the three of you to die.‚Äù What Rodregas did next he knew was meaningless, but he hoped it would give Imeralda a last chance to act.
 He reached inside where he used to find his ‚Äòitch,‚Äô except his former little magical power was now a raging volcano.
 He had learned from Imeralda a new spell to make light; he waved his hands,  mumbled the incantation, and then threw all his power, and sent it straight at Van‚Äôdret in a stream of energy that felt like a river of lava flowing from his hands.
 In fact there was not so much as a flicker of light.
 Rodregas lacked the discipline to channel the power.
 Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs senses were acute on things arcane and he felt the coming flood of power as if it was a real physical thing.
 Van‚Äôdret spread his hands and made a frantic move that sent a corona of power around him.

Suspension of voting rights or of the privileges of membership should be the ultimate penalty for the failure of governments to comply with this condition within a reasonable period of time.
 The affirmation of democratic principles cannot and will not stop with the domestic governance of member countries.
 It is inevitable that the same principles be extended to the relationships between the nations that make up the international community.
 The present structure of the UN system is a product of the Second World War, just as the League of Nations was of the First.
 The Allied powers conceived it at the height of the war and evolved its structure to reflect the immediate post-war realities.
 Russia, the USA, France and the UK emerged from the war as the arbiters of the world order.
 The defeated Axis powers, Germany and Japan, were relegated to the back ground.
 Mainland China had become communist and was therefore excluded from the power structure.
 India and the other colonies had not yet gained their freedom.
 In recognition of the mutual suspicions between Russia and the Western powers, the rule of unanimity usually adopted by political conferences was applied to decisions made by the five major powers that became the permanent members of the Security Council.

They were mostly silent the rest of the day, until we stopped for the night.
 The group split after dinner as Anvil and Grey positioned themselves on rocks at the perimeter of our camp.
 Ruby hung out by Grey and Steed busied himself as Chevelle paced stiffly around the camp.
 I was bored again, with everyone entertaining themselves, so I leaned back against a rock and pulled my pack to my lap.
 I wrapped my cloak loosely around me and positioned my legs so I could place the book there and, hopefully, not be found out.
 I wondered how many more days of traveling we‚Äôd have.
 I didn‚Äôt see a peak‚Äîdidn‚Äôt even know if we were going to the peak of the mountain we were on‚Äîbut I was too cowardly to ask, to think about what had happened, so I distracted myself in the journal.
 My sister hasn‚Äôt spoken to me since our mother passed.
 I wish she was‚Ä¶ different.
 Not merely a different personality, but different altogether.

It turned her words into my nightmares.
 Watchers and trackers, tassels and robes, Chevelle‚Äôs furious gaze as he pushed me from the cliff again.
 Chevelle.
 My watcher.
 ‚ÄúFrey.‚Äù Ruby woke me at dawn, urging me to stand for a few moments before we were back on the horses.
 I was exhausted again, so I hung back from the group as we rode.
 Steed slowed to ride with me as I watched Ruby and Grey banter ahead.
 ‚ÄúSteed, why aren‚Äôt they together?‚Äù He sighed; I didn‚Äôt think he enjoyed discussing his sister‚Äôs personal life.
 ‚ÄúRuby.
 She doesn‚Äôt believe she can get close to anyone‚Ä¶ that way.‚Äù I considered the way she was with me, as if she wanted us to be friends, the way she touched Steed, sat near him.

The one that missed sailed until it hit ground and bounced.
 The hilt of the one that did not smacked him hard in the forehead.
 The elf staggered back, swiping at Harruq as the half-orc charged.
 A thin line of blood appeared on the half-orc‚Äôs forehead, but he was oblivious to it.
 His hands were around his enemy‚Äôs throat and his strength at its greatest.
 The crunching flesh underneath his fingers was all that mattered.
 The elf behind him retrieved his sword and attacked, his right arm hanging useless, his left stabbing desperately.
 Harruq flung the dying body around by the neck.
 The sword buried up to the hilt in the makeshift shield.
 Harruq dropped the dead elf and lashed out.

More than 40 per cent of US exports now go to developing countries and two-thirds of the increase in US exports in recent years has gone to these nations.
 The rising expectations and upward mobility of millions of people in developing countries represent a vast potential source of demand, higher incomes and jobs for the West.
 Increasing incomes among the poorest countries has the greatest multiplier effect on global aggregate demand, because even small increments in per capita income can lead to large increases in the number of households with incomes above the threshold for buying consumer goods.
 Asia is expected to generate half the growth in gross world product and world trade during the 1990s.
 This region will have one billion consumers of televisions, refrigerators and motor vehicles by the year 2000 and a rising appetite for both imported consumer and capital goods.
 East Asia alone, excluding Japan and China, will spend about $900 billion on infrastructure between 1992 and 2000.
 During this decade, China and India will add 21,000 megawatts of electricity generation every year and more telephone switching capacity than the United States and Japan combined.
 Latin America‚Äôs annual requirements for investment in power, water and sewage, telecommunications and transport infrastructure are estimated at $60 billion.
 Rising incomes and increasing exports to the dynamic economies of Asia and Latin America could generate as many as 1.7 million jobs by the end of the decade in the United States alone.
 The growth of the developing economies could provide the major impetus for economic expansion and job creation in both developed and developing countries.

 We all wanted her because, hell, she had that skin, you know, translucent and freckled and white like yonder waning moon.
 But, she was Crafty‚Äôs, sort of.
 It‚Äôs funny.
 Everywhere they went men hit on Kim, no one could help it, and Crafty was so insecure, you know?
 He hated it.

They intended to kill us all.
 And without magic, bound as I was, I didn‚Äôt stand a chance.

 ‚ÄúNo more dust.‚Äù I stood.
 ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just get back.
 Back to training.‚Äù They didn‚Äôt argue, though they were plainly concerned.
 We went to the ridge with the others, but we didn‚Äôt train.
 In fact, I was fairly certain Ruby and Chevelle were avoiding me.
 I waited through the morning and finally‚Äîaround midday‚ÄîI gave up and relaxed onto the ground, staring up at the sky.

It is amazing how the mind focuses in on minutia when things get really scary, but I couldn't think of anything else until I realized it was their eyes.
 Cassie's had gone a pale, unearthly green, while Vincent's had deepened into a near black.
 If eyes really were the windows to the soul, he'd become so twisted and warped there wasn't much left that could truly be considered human.
 The halls had emptied remarkably fast, especially considering how much gossip there was for the rumor mill.
 It was almost like some primitive survival instinct had kicked in and steered everyone away from ground zero.
 With the two of them so much closer, I could feel their energy beating at Jasmin and me.
 It was all I could do now to remain motionless as they entered what even I knew was striking range of Jasmin.
 "Awfully exposed out here, aren't you, precious?"
 Vincent's voice was a low, unnatural thing, pitched so it was just barely audible for humans.
 Cassie's expression made my stomach tighten up and my gorge rise.

 Finally, Harruq voiced his thoughts.
 ‚ÄúYou think Velixar knew it when he sent us to kill him?‚Äù
 Qurrah stretched, letting out a small sigh as his back popped.
 ‚ÄúYes, I do,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúAlthough I don‚Äôt know why.
 A test of some sort perhaps?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúGetting tired of tests,‚Äù Harruq said.

 This was wrong.
 I would return to him tomorrow, set things right.
 As I ran, I realized I was still carrying the dress with me.

 I rolled it up, tucking it under my arm as I approached the castle.
 My prison.
 Prison.
 I pushed the book into my pack and finally slept.

‚ÄúWhere is everyone?‚Äù he asked Doi‚Äôvan.
 Doi‚Äôvan did not look up from the ground where he was trying to straighten out a shield without doing more damage and said, ‚ÄúI wondered that myself.
 Apparently most drop out by this point.
 A lot have been injured, especially during yesterday‚Äôs sword and shield competition, and many simply quit due to not having any points yet.
 If you are going into the most dangerous part of the competition to be injured or killed and you have only one or two points, why bother?‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan said.
 ‚ÄúTo be honest, I am surprised how many are left.
 There are still quite a few young fools out there.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo how many are left now?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúFifty-four, on my last count,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan said.
 Rodregas was a little worried about his shield and wondered if he should jump in and rescue it from the powerful grip of the Hellborn, but he held his tongue and let Doi‚Äôvan handle the equipment.
 ‚ÄúI see you are employing the forces of the Infernal Realm to aid you in the joust,‚Äù said a voice behind Rodregas.

Both turned to see an elf raise his bow and fire.
 ‚ÄúLook out,‚Äù Aurelia said, shoving Harruq aside.
 The arrow hit her breast and reflected off as if hitting stone.
 She glanced at Harruq, her face a mixture of anger and fear.
 ‚ÄúOthers have seen you kill, haven‚Äôt they?‚Äù she asked.
 Harruq could only shrug.
 More shouts came as two other elves turned the corner.
 Aurelia swore as she heard what they said.
 ‚ÄúThey call me traitor,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúI protected you, and now I am a traitor.‚Äù

I smelled something odd and glanced down.
 The meat I was holding had burnt in my hand.
 I cursed, dropping it onto the plate.
 When I looked back to them, Steed was watching me, smiling.
 I tossed the burned meat onto the table, considering going back to bed.
 Ruby laughed and it made my hair stand on end.
 No, I‚Äôd stay.
 She might be our host now but I‚Äôd get my chance.
 I‚Äôd fix her.
 She shifted and the markings on her leg caught my attention.

I tripped just before I hit the first step, and almost went crashing down the flight that led to the basement.
 Luckily I was just quick enough to grab the banister and save myself from a broken neck.
 I didn't quite manage to avoid twisting my ankle though, so I limped all the way up to the second floor.
 Trying to be as casual as possible, I looked into the art room as I hobbled by, but they'd rearranged their stations, and someone's easel was in the way now.
 The sprained ankle had slowed me down enough that there was no way I was going to make it back to my locker before the bell rang.
 Still, I tried to be gracious when it went off just as I handed Mrs. North the papers.
 Based on the number of classrooms on the second floor, and the narrowness of the stairs, there was no point in trying to wait the crowd out.
 I gritted my teeth and limped out into the surge of bodies.
 Surprisingly enough, there were more familiar faces than expected.
 As I grabbed the handrail on the right, I noticed Isaac several feet ahead of me.

"Look, I'm sorry about how I reacted yesterday.
 I shouldn't have left you here like that."
 Britney's voice was coated with sincerity, but it was the thinnest of layers, one which poorly disguised all kinds of nasty little feelings.
 On the other hand, it distracted my mind from the string of thoughts I'd otherwise have followed all the way down to a full-blown panic attack.
 It was a small thing in the grand scheme of the universe, but it was just enough to tilt the balance in her favor.
 I still didn't like her any more than she really liked me, but I was willing to tolerate her.
 To pretend we were friends so that neither of us had to face the scary world entirely on our own.
 "Okay, apology accepted.
 It wasn't very nice, but I suppose everyone makes mistakes."
 Britney's eyes grew bright, even after such a short acquaintance, I knew she was about to launch into a blow-by-blow account of the last twelve or so hours.

He was halfway down the alley when he heard a voice call out.
 ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù
 Harruq kept going.
 He was used to harassment and verbal abuse from the guards.
 Once out of sight, though, he was usually out of mind.
 He relied on that as he turned a corner into the small space around their shed.
 Qurrah, who had been resting on the shallow grass, hurried to his feet at Harruq‚Äôs approach.
 ‚ÄúWhat is the matter?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúNothing, but you might want to hide in there.
 Quick!‚Äù

 June walked towards me until she was standing right in front.
 I could almost see through her body, which was really starting to freak me out.
 ‚ÄúYou have to get back Seth,‚Äù she whispered.

A single elf approached.
 He was dressed in a long green cloak, silvery armor, and he bore his bow openly.
 Antonil could barely make out his features, since he was so far down the street.
 The elf halted, drew an arrow, and fired it into the air.
 It smacked the dirt an inch from Antonil‚Äôs foot.
 Sergan shook his head and stared in wonder at his commander.
 The man had not flinched.
 ‚ÄúI shall take that as your answer,‚Äù Antonil shouted to the town.
 ‚ÄúWoodhaven desires death.‚Äù
 He drew his sword and spoke softly.

Buddy got his first musicmaker, a ukulele, when he was a sapling, six years old, a first-grader at Idlewild Elementary.
 He hung onto that uke as if it was his lifeline, time and time again having it taken from him on the playground where he would serenade a few curious classmates with his bewailing renditions of old Hank Williams songs.
 The end of most schooldays found little Buddy in the principal‚Äôs office explaining why he should get his instrument back and vowing never to bring it again.
 Until tomorrow.
 At twelve Buddy had graduated to electric guitar, a gift from his father, Al Gardner, who had played clarinet with a dance band called Dick Delisi and the Syncopators, at the Vapors Supper Club in his own mis-spent youth.
 Buddy‚Äôs mother, Elise, could only pull at her hair and clap dishpan hands over her ears when the noise emanating from Buddy‚Äôs room began.
 To her it sounded like the can-opener on warp speed.
 Buddy drew from everywhere, listening with equal fervor to Woody Guthrie, Odetta, Hoagy Carmichael, Django Reinhardt, Coleman Hawkins, Bill Haley, Lonnie Donegan, Howlin Wolf, Eric Dolphy, Skip James, Shostakovich.
 Music fed Buddy the way most of us grew up on oatmeal and peanut butter.
 And he absorbed it all, filtering it through his sensitive system to come out his delicate fingertips as liquid electricity, a sound even today many guitarists cannot duplicate and few can even explain.

It was so real, and she gripped the edge of her seat as she waited to see what would happen after he fell into the water.
 The villain jumped up on the platform to make his bows with the rest of the cast.
 Marie raised wide eyes to Rick's face as they stood to leave.
 "Was that man who was on fire hurt?"
 "No.
 He'll do another show in a couple of hours."
 "How do they do that?"
 "The jacket is made out of some kind of special material."
 That was the most amazing stunt she saw that day, but there were dozens of special effects and props that filled her with wonder.
 They took a tour of the movie lot, and Marie was excited to see the sets of some of the movies Rick had rented for her.

There are no true capitalist societies in the world.
 There are no free markets.
 The free market system is highly regulated and controlled by the very state over which it claims victory.
 But although in reality both systems are dead, the ideology of the capitalist system lives on and casts an illusory impression of supremacy.
 Rather than searching for a victor and vanquished, the urgent need is to find a successor that combines and synthesizes the enlightened values of both systems ‚Äì freedom and equality, liberty and security.
 It has been amply proved that the authoritarian state is incapable of exerting a benevolent authority over the people without imposing severe restrictions on freedom, stifling human energy and creativity, leading sooner or later to rising discontent and a loss of social vitality.
 It is also abundantly clear that money as an institution operating through the free pricing mechanism of the market system ‚Äì although it does succeed in generating high levels of energy, creativity and productivity ‚Äì regards people as a purchasable commodity or a potential market, but is otherwise indifferent to human values and welfare.
 Neither the determinism of the state nor the determinism of the market can be adequate in themselves to achieve the goals of peace and prosperity that we strive after.
 It has been generally assumed that the transition now taking place in Eastern Europe will sooner or later lead these countries to adopt forms of government and economy identical to those prevalent in the West.
 But for those raised in a society that offered a great measure of social security, the poverty and insecurity of the Western system are gross inadequacies.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll both go,‚Äù she pushed, forcing a polite tone.
 The rest of the group was quiet, watching us, and Ruby eyed Steed as we turned and headed toward the house.
 As soon as we were out of earshot, though I was still being dragged by the arm, I asked Chevelle, ‚ÄúDid something happen with the twins?‚Äù Ruby laughed.
 We both stared at her.
 ‚ÄúTwins,‚Äù she scoffed.
 ‚ÄúRight, well, you know what I mean,‚Äù I said, embarrassed.
 Chevelle‚Äôs tone softened.
 ‚ÄúNo.
 Everything is fine.‚Äù Ruby chimed in, ‚ÄúIt is fine,‚Äù and I was knew it was intended for him.
 He relaxed his grip on my arm and slowed our pace as he directed an almost imperceptible nod at Ruby.

A flex of his muscles cracked bone, and the sword fell from a limp hand.
 Harruq let him go, bellowed at the first elf, and then hurled both his blades.
 They turned end over end through the air, one missing, one not.
 The one that missed sailed until it hit ground and bounced.
 The hilt of the one that did not smacked him hard in the forehead.
 The elf staggered back, swiping at Harruq as the half-orc charged.
 A thin line of blood appeared on the half-orc‚Äôs forehead, but he was oblivious to it.
 His hands were around his enemy‚Äôs throat and his strength at its greatest.
 The crunching flesh underneath his fingers was all that mattered.
 The elf behind him retrieved his sword and attacked, his right arm hanging useless, his left stabbing desperately.

 "You won't be.
 I think it'll be fun."
 She smiled then.
 "Can we watch television today?"
 That pleasure was only one of many that day.
 First she loaded the dishwasher while Rick supervised, and she poured in the soap and started the machine herself.
 After a shower, she had lessons on the use of the food processor, the blender, and--delight of delights--the microwave oven.
 "I can make lunch now," she proclaimed happily.

 Just eat some meat and vegetables first, and then you can eat the whole thing if you want.‚Äù She took another bite and then wrapped the bar up.

 I don't really like it when people shorten my name.
 Bad associations with nicknames and all that."
 Britney's smile was only a pale imitation of the brilliant thing she'd flashed a few moments previously, but it signaled a willingness to try and make small talk at least.
 "How did you know my name?"

This growth could have been considerably more impressive but for constraints placed on it by both tariff and, particularly, non-tariff barriers.
 The latter have proliferated in recent decades and affected almost half of OECD imports during the 1980s.
 By the end of 1990, there were more than 200 export-constraint arrangements involving product groups of impor tance to developing countries.
 The incidence of anti-dumping cases against developing countries rose substantially in the late 1980s.
 The more recent effort by the industrial nations to impose 'fair labour standards' on exports from developing countries could well become another form of constraint, unless carefully formulated to focus on the basic rights of workers, rather than on arbitrary minimum wage levels.
 Efforts to accelerate the dismantling of both trade and non-trade barriers should be viewed as a central element of a global strategy to stimulate employment generation.
 6.Debt repayments: The debt problem is a major obstacle to the development and welfare of at least 60 heavily indebted, developing countries, including two-thirds of the world's poorest nations.
 Most of these countries suffered a decline in per capita income over the past decade and are now in arrears with more than 20 per cent of their debt obligations.
 The debt burden discourages new foreign investment and lending to these coun tries and prevents them from stimulating economic growth through additional domestic savings and investment.
 International debt relief has helped ten, mostly middle-income, debtor countries significantly reduce their commercial debt.

It could also be a reason that the gods answered my prayers and helped me succeed against Ravenhurr.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo the Gods might not be against all Immortalists, but just the ones who are tapping into the Infernal power?‚Äù asked Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúAll Immortalists deserve to die for their crimes,‚Äù Rodregas answered.
 His angry response did not surprise the others.
 ‚ÄúAgreed,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan, raising his hand in a calming gesture, ‚Äúbut it might be helpful to understand what the gods will support us doing.‚Äù ‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù Rodregas added.
 ‚ÄúDoi‚Äôvan, do you remember the names of the other Immortalists who were interested in purchasing you for their rituals?‚Äù ‚ÄúI heard no names,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan answered, ‚Äúbut I heard one of them referred to as ‚ÄòThe Ambassador.‚Äô They treated him with great respect.
 I understood he was a very important person.‚Äù ‚ÄúI wonder if that is Ambassador Van‚Äôdret?‚Äù asked Jordaan.
 ‚ÄúHe is a powerful Immortalist and said to be very close to Taiga.
 Some claim he is one of the few people that Taiga both respects and trusts.‚Äù ‚ÄúAmbassador Van‚Äôdret?‚Äù Rodregas responded thoughtfully.
 ‚ÄúHe visited Ravenhurr about five years ago.
 Ravenhurr seemed eager to have him visit, which was unusual for him.

I even cut off some dates long before Liz's midnight curfew to come home and read.
 My room became Raskolnikov's basement garret.
 If my mom dared enter to bring me a sandwich, I grabbed the plate, shooed her out, shut the door, and usually didn't bother to eat.
 Early in the novel Raskolnikov is in a tavern with a drunk, Marmeledov, whose daughter Sonia has prostituted herself for the money to feed her destitute step-mother and brothers and sisters.
 Marmeledov tells of a dream in which God sets straight the wise men who object to his accepting Sonia into glory: "Here is why, oh you wise, here is why, oh you of understanding‚Äî-her sins which are many are forgiven for she has loved much."
 I jotted the quote on a slip of paper and kept it in my wallet until it disintegrated.
 The only time in my rather lengthy existence I have so treasured an idea.
 Liz wanted more attention from me than I wanted to give.
 But we played fairly well together until, one Sunday evening, I wanted to go to a certain dance, which was held weekly and at which I always danced with other girls in addition to Liz.
 This time, Liz wanted me to myself, at her place.

However, that child was born in 1936, so it is highly unlikely that she had a terminal infection for five years.
 Rumors at the time suggested that her husband had transmitted a venereal disease to her."
 Rick was shocked.
 He had a hard time picturing the young woman in the picture as a victim.
 Of course, even today women stayed with men who abused them, and it would have been much harder for a woman in the 1920s to escape.
 But why had she married him?
 Had she not seen what type of man he was?
 He turned back to the picture.
 The article had said that she‚Äôd been vibrant and fun-loving in her youth, and he could see those qualities in her eyes.
 He would have liked to have known her.

 I suddenly remembered the pages I had burnt in the briar patch so long ago.
 Burnt before I‚Äôd read them.
 My eyes flashed open.

 I glared at Chevelle.
 It must have been dreadful, because he nodded and backed away, his mouth tight.
 ‚ÄúOh, Frey.‚Äù Ruby‚Äôs voice was low and soothing.
 I grimaced as I turned to her, not at all wanting what I was about to say.

While you may very well have lost your way, it would have been a small matter for one of the others to track you down.
 You have, if I may say so, a very distinctive smell.
 It reminds me of a type of sage brush that hasn't grown here in quite some time."
 His sigh was more felt than heard, and it put me in mind of mountains, redwoods, and other ancient things.
 "Donovan, can I ask you a question?"
 "Of course, mistress.
 I'm afraid there are many which I won't be able to answer, but it would be a delight to share those things which haven't been forbidden me."
 "You're really old, aren't you?"
 His hesitation was brief, so much so I almost thought I'd imagined it.
 "Yes, Mistress Paige, I'm quite old."

‚ÄúThese bastards are trying to take our armor and swords!
 We nearly died because it was the right thing to do to rescue the Nymphs, especially with the children being part of the caravan.‚Äù Rodregas added in a growl, ‚ÄúThere were probably Dire steeds as well.‚Äù ‚ÄúBy the Infernal Daemons, I might be as strong as a Celestial Lion, but we are going to get chopped to little pieces until we have decent armor and weapons.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut why would they keep the armor?‚Äù growled Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúThese people do not seem to be warriors.
 What good would it do them?‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan tossed his wild black mane of hair and his eyes lighted with rage.
 Rodregas suddenly realized that he better not feed the Hellborn‚Äôs rage.
 Those with Infernal blood were known for their berserker rages.
 They seldom survived the rampages, but were nearly unstoppable when they fell into one.
 Rodregas breathed deeply, trying to lower his own anger and frustration.
 Jordaan stepped outside the room Rodregas had been staying in and into the small clearing that was the center of the Nymph Dwello, the tent like structure that they used for houses.
 ‚ÄúGentleman, please,‚Äù said Jordaan.

Rodregas looked back at the sorcerer who actually seemed surprised at watching the oath sworn, ‚ÄúSatisfied, Sir?‚Äù The sorcerer waved his hand and without a word went back to his chair sitting down as a king to his throne.
 The Knight Captain called for a squire, who he commanded to find them a room.
 Rodregas sensed that the Knight Captain was not happy with what had happened, but he said no word of apology.
 As the three were led away, Rodregas asked the boy the name of the sorcerer at the table.
 ‚ÄúThat is the Immortalist Van‚Äôdret, Ambassador to the Knights from the Guild.
 He is very powerful you know.
 We are told to do whatever he commands, but also told to stay as far away from him as possible,‚Äù said the young boy, who could not have been much more than twelve years old.
 Rodregas nodded and said, ‚ÄúSounds like good advice.‚Äù Rodregas looked up as Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda entered the room.
 Doi‚Äôvan looked grim.
 But as Rodregas assumed no one had died, he had to smile.

Qurrah laughed.
 ‚ÄúHe lost,‚Äù he said, pointing to the night sky.
 ‚ÄúAnd he doesn‚Äôt know how badly.‚Äù
 One by one, the skulls‚Äô fire went out and they fell like morbid hail upon the city.
 ‚ÄúLimitless,‚Äù Qurrah said, his smile trembling.
 Blood ran from his nose, and his skin was so pale Harruq could see his veins.
 ‚ÄúThe well is limitless.‚Äù
 His eyes rolled into his head.
 Without another word, he collapsed.
 He dreamt of fire poured into flesh and a man whose eyes were glass.

Then again, I'd seen Mom pull off some pretty crazy tricks with her camera, maybe there would be some way to simulate glowing water, some kind of photography trick I'd never heard of.
 I walked downstairs as the eastern sky was just starting to change colors.
 Mom was already gone.
 The message board was conspicuously empty, so she was either still frustrated with me, angry at our hopeless situation, or wrapped back up in her quest to become a renowned photographer.
 Britney picked me up on schedule and I somehow made it through my first two classes.
 Mrs. Sorenson was still out to prove to everyone I was an idiot, and Heathcliff was still a psychopath despite Mr. Whethers' best efforts to explain the character's motivation.
 Math was actually the high point of the morning.
 Mrs. Campbell was smart enough to put Britney off in a corner surrounded by the kind of kids she'd never even consider talking to under normal circumstances.
 Not having Britney distract me all hour would have been a blessing by itself, but things got even better when Mrs. Campbell complimented me on the homework I handed in.
 "Most excellently done, Miss Paige.

He kissed her temple.
 ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we put all this stuff up and have it tomorrow?
 I‚Äôll take you out to dinner tonight.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to do that.‚Äù ‚ÄúI bet you‚Äôd like to try out one of those buffets I told you about.‚Äù Her eyes widened.
 ‚ÄúA buffet?
 With lots of desserts?‚Äù He chuckled.
 ‚ÄúI know just the place.‚Äù Rick‚Äôs attentiveness calmed her, and she went to bed that night with a full stomach and an odd sense of security.
 Nothing about what had happened to her made sense, but Rick was right.
 If she had to walk out of 1927 into another time, she was fortunate she‚Äôd walked into his time.
 The week went by quickly.
 Marie always began the day with a walk in the garden, and Rick always hugged her and dried her tears when she returned.

As punishment, he shoved a hot poker down my throat, ruining my voice into what you hear now.
 One night tribes of hyena-men stormed his tower, wanting vengeance for the many of their kind he had taken to butcher and maim.‚Äù
 Qurrah kept his eyes low, unable to meet Velixar‚Äôs gaze.
 ‚ÄúI was afraid when they came, but as I watched Master slaughter hundreds of them with his golems and his shields of bone I felt at home amid the carnage.
 I knew then what I was to become.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúHow did you escape?‚Äù Velixar asked.
 ‚ÄúMaster exhausted himself defending his tower,‚Äù Qurrah said, waving a dismissive hand.
 ‚ÄúHe collapsed at the very top.
 I cast a spell upon his throat, filling it with ice.
 I watched him die and then I left that disgusting place forever.‚Äù

Your friend already hurt himself learning that.‚Äù Seth wasn't looking so good.
 He was bent over and was grabbing at his neck.
 I then realized that the snake was now a smaller brown colored snake and had its whole body wrapped completely around his neck.
 I had an awful feeling that I couldn't help Seth without hurting him.
 I was helpless.
 Emily and Jason were farther off fighting their own swarm.
 I could see from here that they were slowly losing too.
 Emily continued to try to fry the creatures or knock them away with air, but it wasn't really working.
 I kept seeing Jason's knives fly off into the woods, or sink into the ground, instead of hitting their mark.
 ‚ÄúAnd now half-ling,‚Äù it whispered with joy, ‚Äúyou die.‚Äù It lunged up at me.

How could I learn without a teacher?
 Chevelle.
 The fire died as I thought of the concern he‚Äôd shown me in the clearing, the tender moment we‚Äôd shared.
 With one word, the flames caught again, burning with a vengeance through the field.
 Watcher.
 None of it had been real.
 He was a watcher, he‚Äôd volunteered to watch me, to keep me in line.
 So I‚Äôd teach myself, take the risk and learn the magic without guidance.
 What did I have to lose?
 The plan was formed: I‚Äôd practice until I was strong enough to return to the village.

 ‚ÄúDrink.‚Äù Yes, I was thirsty.

 I took a long pull and then another.
 I couldn‚Äôt seem to quench the thirst.

 ‚ÄúEnough.‚Äù My stomach roiled and I realized what I had drunk.
 ‚ÄúUgh, cat pee.‚Äù I thought I might hurl.
 How much of that healing crap had I drunk?
 I heaved once and Steed shook beneath me with laughter.

It was more traveled than I would have liked, so I swung wide, through the trees instead.
 The wind shifted and the scent of roasting meat assaulted me, dragging my attention, my feet, its way.
 Despite my concerns about other elves, my stomach tightened, my mouth watering as I followed it through the trees.
 They broke into a small clearing, and there in the center stood a cloaked figure, kneeling down as he turned a meat-covered spit.
 Pressed tight behind an oak tree, I shuffled sideways to get a better view.
 I was sure it was an elf, male, from his size.
 The smell of real food was consuming, and I was watching the cooked meat roll over the flame as I moved again.
 A dry leaf crushed beneath my foot.
 ‚ÄúCome then, there‚Äôs plenty for both of us,‚Äù the figure called.
 I cursed.

 "No.
 For the trip.

 I can't believe you're going to Hollywood just for me."

The first official plenary meeting of ICPF was held in Trieste, Italy, in October 1989, within a few days of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
 Over taken by the staggering pace of developments arising from the end of the Cold War, the world was being altered almost beyond recognition.
 Our ambition to slow the arms race appeared suddenly insignificant in the light of unfolding events.
 While we contemplated strategy, COMECON and the Warsaw Pact were breaking up, the USSR began to dissolve, democratic institutions began to spread, and command economies started transforming themselves into free market systems.
 These monumental achievements were not purchased without cost.
 Peace was accompanied by partial economic collapse in Eastern Europe.
 It was evident from the outset that the transition in these countries would not be smooth or easy and that the destiny of the world in the twenty-first century would be influenced decisively by the outcome.
 Severe food shortages in the Soviet Union, which angered the long-suppressed population and compelled the government to take radical action, once again highlighted the linkages between peace and food.
 Production dropped precipitously as frantic efforts were made to reverse economic decline by radical measures.
 Although these events were closely observed and strongly assisted by top international experts, the world lacked both the conceptual knowledge and the practical experience needed to guide these nations through their crisis.

He held nothing back.
 He weaved his swords through three stabs, feinted a high slash, and then twirled up and around for a low thrust.
 Aurelia fell for the feint and brought her staff up high, leaving her lower half exposed.
 Her slender frame twisted.
 A sword cut a thin line across the green fabric of her dress but did not touch skin.
 She thought Harruq might stop and claim the cut counted.
 He didn‚Äôt.
 Instead he crosscut, his left arm swiping right while the other swept left.
 She turned to one side, using her staff to press one sword into the dirt and knock the second swipe just above her.
 The staff continued twirling, positioning Harruq‚Äôs hands further out of place.

It was blatantly obvious I wasn't welcome.
 Unsure where to sit, I almost spun around and walked back into the hall until Brandon caught my eye and waved me over.
 I had to detour around the tangle of tables that belonged to the closest thing Sanctuary had to real Goths.
 My wandering path brought me around to where I could see what I'd mentally dubbed 'Alec's corner'.
 It was a good thing there was an empty chair nearby.
 The force of Jasmin's stare was almost a palpable thing; my knees got weak so quickly it was like she'd reached out and pushed me.
 I steadied myself and then tried to ignore the way my skin crawled as I crossed the rest of the distance to Brandon's table.
 "The mongrels unnerve you a bit?"
 The scorn on the face that the comment belonged to was unnerving.
 I'd seen him several times before, but didn't have a name to go with his aristocratic features.

 Oh yes, this would hurt.
 I loosed my cloak and pitched it aside, lowering myself in a defensive stance, hands out and ready.

 Blood trickled from the strike point.
 Ruby giggled.

Crap!
 I stubbed my toe on a root, one of the pitfalls of living in a tree.
 It throbbed and I slammed the door in frustration as I left the tree.
 It only took a moment to realize what I‚Äôd done.
 I picked up the pace as Aunt Fannie‚Äôs curses came screaming through the closed door.
 She was determined not to let me forget what a burden it had been to take me in, even if it used every spare ounce of energy to do it.
 My mouth twisted, and I shifted into a run until I reached the little outcropping of rock on the west side of the village.
 I was still thinking about it when I slowed to climb through the tangle of brush in back of Junnie‚Äôs house, but once my fingers trailed the cool rock surrounding the structure, it fell away.
 When it felt as if I could breathe again, I rapped two quick knocks and then one loud knock on the small wooden door.
 It was the one sure way she‚Äôd know it was me.

Dad had always been there to listen when I got into problems like this.
 He'd known how to deal with the world, how to work with circumstances so that what resulted was beneficial, or at least something I could live with.
 And Cindi.
 If she were still here this would all be a moot point.
 I hadn't ever needed any other friends while she was alive, hadn't ever had to really put myself out there where I could get dragged into the kind of stupid infighting I'd read about for so many years growing up.
 Chapter 9 I couldn't bring myself to speak to Britney the entire way home.
 It didn't really matter; she spent the whole time complaining about a dozen different ways in which everyone around her was making her life miserable.
 She didn't need any kind of response from me.
 I had the house to myself again, so I worked on homework until I was too exhausted to continue.
 It wasn't until I was almost asleep that I realized I was hoping I¬†wouldn't¬†have one of the incredible, vivid dreams tonight.

 --@ The hand-drawn symbol on the bottom of the page was so familiar it almost felt like a part of me now.
 He'd saved our house, got Mom a job, and then given me the best birthday present I could've asked for.
 I felt my insides clench and knot, but this time it was happiness that brought tears to my eyes.
 My wavering vision was just up to making out the outline of Rachel's present where I'd left it on the table.
 Feeling incredibly ungrateful and thoughtless, I limped over to the table and tore open the delicate wrapping paper.
 It was a copy of the latest Les Mis√©rables movie, complete with the score from the most recent Broadway production, and a signed picture of the entire cast.

Was this what it felt like to take on a greater sigil?
 Rodregas stood up.
 He felt strength and other things he was not sure how to describe.
 He looked around the room and the dim light now seemed far brighter.
 He started walking over toward where he had left Doi‚Äôvan, and this time he got to see the result of taking on a greater sigil as the dragon reared up.
 All three heads roared and the wings started to beat and the dragon seemed to actually fly for a second.
 For just a brief moment there were two daemon dragons.
 Then one of them fell toward the ground only to sink into the shape of Doi‚Äôvan.
 Doi‚Äôvan staggered and Rodregas reached out and caught him to keep him from falling.
 Apparently, being a three headed daemon dragon did not include a cat-like ability to land from a fall.

 Pete Fucking Townshend, man.
 CM:  	Wow.
 How did you get that sound?
 BG:  	Jim‚Äôs idea.

 Johnny ‚Äì Why are you spying on me?

 Jim ‚Äì What do you mean spying?
 You repeat it over and over while sitting and watching television in the living room.

‚ÄúThe human army is right outside the town,‚Äù Harruq grumbled.
 ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt wait until tomorrow night.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúPatience, brother,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶‚Äåpatience.‚Äù
 Another hour, and still no shadow.
 Harruq stepped back inside and plopped down.
 The other half-orc remained at the door, his eyes not leaving the gray outside.
 ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not sending for us,‚Äù Harruq said.
 ‚ÄúYou are correct,‚Äù said Velixar‚Äôs voice, startling both of them.
 They turned to see their master emerge from the shadows of their home, his red eyes gleaming.

They lived in what had once been a large shed.
 The door was still boarded shut, but the window, well‚Ä¶
 For two such as they, windows worked as well as doors.
 They sat diagonally of each other so they had room to stretch their legs.
 Harruq unhooked his belt and placed his swords in a corner, brushing their hilts against his fingertips.
 ‚ÄúI want to learn how to use them,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúThink anyone will teach me?‚Äù
 Qurrah laughed.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find plenty who‚Äôll teach you how to die by one,‚Äù he said.

Since the charter would bind members and the alliance to eschew the use of force and aggression for any reason, it would represent a stabilizing, non-provocative, non-offensive defence.
 Its charter could also include specific provisions for close association with other international forces.
 Its combined strength and technological capabilities would exceed those of any of its members and constitute a substantial deterrent to aggression against any member country.
 It would significantly reduce the costs of security for members, possibly by up to 50 or 75 per cent, without compromising their legitimate security needs.
 The more members, the lower the defence expenditure required by each, both because the collective force would be larger and because the number of potential adversaries would be reduced proportionately.
 The organization of a World Army, run on well-defined and transparent lines with appropriate mechanisms for control and responsiveness, would help eliminate the need for countries to maintain their own large standing armies.
 Ultimately this could enable other nations to follow the lead of Costa Rica, which abolished its military forces several decades ago.
 National Sovereignty and International Responsibility
 The recent calamities in Rwanda and Somalia following the outbreak of civil and ethnic war, and in Bosnia following the breakaway of several Yugoslav republics, demonstrate the need for substantially improving international mechanisms for war prevention, peacemaking and peace keeping, and for protection of basic human rights both between and within states.
 The effort of the international community to deal with these events has brought to the fore fundamental issues regarding national sovereignty and the responsibilities of the world community.

A novella about a young woman whose Christian parents, when their daughter finds herself in extreme trouble, appear more concerned with remaining in accord with their church than with helping or even trying to understand their daughter.
 Its honesty touches my heart.
 Jaime and I spend a day roaming the city, with an hour stop at the Seattle Mystery Bookstore, which played a role in the final scene of Road Kill, an account of a book tour my friend Alan and I did together.
 At several of the tour stops, including Seattle and Portland, Mike Connelly joined us.
 Since then, Mike has become an international bestseller.
 Alan hasn‚Äôt.
 Neither have I, probably for many reasons concerning craft, background, personality, genre and such.
 But I still have to wonder if God‚Äôs hand might play a role in my lack of whopping success.
 Maybe he knows lots of money would turn me from a rascal into a scoundrel, more self-absorbed than ever.
 I wonder if Brother Lawrence, had he become Pope, would have practiced the presence of God so well.

My eyes opened in horror as I saw the small trickle of blood fall from a hole in the right wing.
 Then we started to fall.
 Chapter 9
 I screamed so loud that my ears felt like they were going to pop.
 We plummeted to the ground, falling closer and closer‚Ä¶ Oh man, I thought and closed my eyes.
 Don‚Äôt look, don‚Äôt look, don‚Äôt look‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúReally!‚Äù Seth yelled at the sky.
 ‚ÄúThis brings new meaning to ‚Äòthings can‚Äôt get any worse!‚Äô‚Äù I gripped furiously to the limp dragon.
 I was falling to my death: so this is how it was going to end.
 I never pictured it this way; I thought I would die a little more heroically, not screaming like a little girl.
 ‚ÄúNot now Seth,‚Äù Emily screamed at him.

That was where Rick found her at 5:30.
 "Hi--how was your day?"
 She turned off the TV and looked at him with wide eyes.
 "Do you know how many women there are who have love affairs with their husbands' brothers?"
 Rick groaned.
 "You've been watching talk shows."
 "There was one woman who was having an affair with her husband's 15-year-old brother!
 And she was 32!"
 "Don't watch that garbage.
 Those people are poor and uneducated and have no morals, and people watch that stuff to be horrified and make fun of them.

We have argued earlier that establishment of effective and lasting peace requires a radical restructuring of the existing institutions for global governance.
 Unless and until the UN comes to embody in its own functioning the principles of representative democracy, it cannot hope to play a leading role in maintaining peace and freedom in the world.
 As government and political leaders know only too well, an organization with responsibility but without authority is doomed to failure.
 Unless UN member states invest international institutions with the necessary authority and meet their financial commitments to support them, the world will continue to drift and flounder, powerless to oppose petty dictators and ruthless aggression.
 Unless a cooperative world military force comes into existence, every country will continue to be burdened with the enormous expense and insecurity characteristic of the old system.
 Perhaps more than any other institution, the military has under stood and demonstrated the enormous power of organization to accomplish a goal.
 The Gulf War was a dramatic illustration of the importance of reliable information, perfect planning, logistical support systems, effective chains of command and swift responsiveness to changing situations.
 If humankind could mobilize and apply the same efficiency to the war on poverty and unemployment that it has exhibited in preparing for and waging military wars against each other, very soon there would be no more poverty or unemployment to fight.
 During the Second World War Ford Motors converted from manufacture of cars for the masses to making trucks and airplanes for the military, producing B-24 bombers at the rate of one per hour from a single production plant.
 If conversion from civilian to military production could be carried out by so many countries within one or two years, it must be possible to convert the military from war-based to peace-based applications, and defence industries from military to civilian production, within half a decade.

Classes, shit man, how could anyone concentrate on classes with that going on?
 Most of my teachers hated me anyway, you know, rock and roll, devil‚Äôs music, my hair was longer than most of my classmates, I insisted on wearing these combat boots, even in summer when sweating in them was like wearing a swamp on each foot, and I had attitude, of course.
 Rock and roll attitude.
 I was unassailable, untouchable.
 Of course the teachers hated me.
 One in particular, tried to get me expelled, suspended, something, because I wore an American Flag on my butt.
 (laughs)  It sounds funny now.
 I had this peace symbol, you know, the two finger symbol made of stars and stripes, and, Jesus, my mother sewed it on the back pocket of my jeans.
 This teacher‚Äîwhat was her name?
 was it freshman year, sophomore?

He tightened his arms around her.
 "I love you, Marie."
 "I love you too.
 And I want to marry you.
 How soon can we get married?
 And where's my ring?"
 He laughed, setting her back to look at her.
 "We'll go inside and get it.
 But you have to tell me what happened.
 You wanted so badly to go home."

 Before the elf took to the sky, however, he paused.
 ‚ÄúAntonil‚Ä¶‚Äåsomething more is at work here.
 Be wary.
 I will not take sides in this conflict, and neither shall the Quellan elves, but if I find who caused this war, I will kill him.
 It is the least I can do.‚Äù
 A great beat of white wings and then the elf was in the air.
 Antonil watched him fly far south, watched until he was a tiny white dot among a blanket of stars.
 Before he stopped watching, however, he saw more than fifty similar white dots line the horizon.

Its calls for a standing world army, for the recognition of full employment as a fundamental right and for the elimination of protectionist trade policies to mention but a few examples will cause some sharp intakes of breath among world leaders.
 Indeed, the report contains many ideas that merit and should stimulate further reflection.
 The situation of the countries in transition in Eastern Europe, high lighted in this report, illustrates perfectly the need for an integrated approach to development considered as a total human process.
 The Commission's report contains specific proposals in this regard as well as an overview pointing to existing domestic assets of various kinds which could help the countries concerned.
 It addresses the topic of job creation with innovative ideas on the roles of technology and trade, and emphasizes the significance of the developing countries and agricul ture in the world economy.
 Its global education programme proposal placing appropriate emphasis on the key issue of girls' and women's education is one that particularly commends itself to UNESCO, which is already actively engaged in efforts along similar lines in conjunction with its UN partners.
 This timely report should help to promote the idea of human-centred development within a culture of peace as a way forward to a better world.
 We are gratified that ICPF should have assigned UNESCO, as the intellectual arm of the United Nations, a prominent role in its recommended agenda for action, and we reaffirm our commit ment to working with all possible partners in pursuit of the goal of global peace and sustainable human development.
 Federico Mayor Director General UNESCO
 The International Commission on Peace and Food began its work at a time of uncommon opportunities for rapid transition on a global scale to democratic ways of life, freedom of the media, and an independent judiciary; food, literacy, health and jobs for all; and sustainable life styles based on harmony between humankind and nature.

Lisa must be thinking all kinds of things, as, being wired, I cannot call her to give her an update.
 I love her so much, and I always return in my mind to the day I met her and then everything is in perspective and nothing else matters but our love.
 Chapter 12: Who‚Äôs Your Daddy Lisa and I discovered ‚Äúwe‚Äù were pregnant about four months into our marriage.
 Even though we had not planned to start a family so early, we were thrilled, excited and anxious at the thought of creating a life conceived by the two of us.
 After passing out during the movie at the birthing class, (yes, really!)
 I was not convinced I was going to be the pillar of strength my wife would need during the birth of our child (and neither was Lisa).
 I remember the movie; it was titled ‚ÄúThe Brazilian Squatting Method.‚Äù Until then, The Exorcist was the scariest movie I had ever seen, and this beat it hands down.
 I excused myself from the room‚Äîwhich was filled with couples huddled together on little mats on the ground‚Äîas I began to pass out.
 I headed down the hall towards the men‚Äôs restroom and I felt myself weakening with every step.
 I pushed on the door and then the next thing I knew, I was waking up on the floor with the restroom door against my side, propping it open like a bag of sand, half of my body in the restroom and half out in the hall.

He had been a volunteer.
 ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just go,‚Äù I said coldly, looking up the mountain.
 We rode wordlessly on as I chewed over this new knowledge.
 As my watcher, Chevelle would have been involved in the binding by Council.
 Maybe Fannie should have been punished for whatever she had done, but how could they assume I would follow in her footsteps?
 So I‚Äôd killed a bird, stolen a few papers from the council library.
 My argument faltered, so I went back to anger, betrayal that he had lied to me.
 And not just him.
 The entire village must have known I was bound, known I couldn‚Äôt perform magic, as they sat and watched me try.
 Sending me to Junnie for lessons, allowing Evelyn to taunt me without recourse, giving me the blame for everything that happened.

 It is the only way you can learn to respond quickly.
 You need to get past that block, to use your defense as instinct.‚Äù I really didn‚Äôt want to play anymore.
 But before I could protest, a black rock hurtled toward me.
 My hand jerked up automatically to swat it away but my arm hit an invisible wall.
 The rock slammed into my face.
 I was fairly certain my nose was bleeding from the impact.
 I tried to slow my horse but no longer had control of him.
 ‚ÄúAgain,‚Äù Chevelle warned.
 The rock was coming for me a second time.

He felt every fiber of his being simply burn.
 Rodregas tried to scream, but no sound could pass his lips.
 CHAPTER 2 FROM THE ASHES
 When Rodregas awoke he was confused about why he was lying on the floor.
 As he opened his eyes he was also alarmed to see Captain Poir looking down at him with a confused and worried expression.
 Captain Poir said, ‚ÄúMaster Ravenhurr?‚Äù It was a question.
 Rodregas wondered why his captain would think he was the Master.
 And then suddenly it all rushed back to him, all the details of the final ceremony.
 ‚ÄúOh my gods he had burned!‚Äù Rodregas thought in alarm.
 He quickly raised his hand to his eyes, but instead of his scarred, wrinkled hand that should have been seared by burns; there was a powerful smooth hand.

It sounded like a different wolf, and it was closer than the first one.
 I tried to run faster, but all that time studiously avoiding exercise was working against me.
 I topped a slight rise and then tripped as the ground wasn't where I expected it to be.
 My jacket saved me from picking up any really serious scrapes this time, but just before I finished tumbling to a stop I slammed my head into a crescent-shaped rock.
 My vision swam in and out of focus, but I struggled to my feet, only to nearly fall again as my right ankle all but collapsed under me.
 They were definitely closer now.
 They'd stopped howling, but I could still hear them.
 I somehow found myself on my back again, looking up at the biggest wolf I'd ever seen.
 TV had given me the impression that a wolf shouldn't be much bigger than a German Shepherd.
 These guys were roughly the size of a small pony, one nearly black, the other more of a gray color, both with yellowish eyes, and lips pulled back to show teeth the size of my fingers.

She might‚Äôve known Eric, but not well.
 Still, when she spotted us, she ran up and clutched one of my hands and one of Cliff‚Äôs.
 She blubbered a minute and finally spat out, ‚ÄúEric‚Äôs dead.‚Äù Suddenly kids rushed us from all directions.
 I felt like carrion under attack from buzzards.
 I broke loose from the girl and hustled into the nearest classroom building and into the restroom.
 I leaned onto the sink and glared at the mirror, where my flesh appeared to peel and shred.
 I kicked the wall and howled.
 A teacher came rushing in.
 He was a large Spaniard who had given me plenty of office referrals for failing to shave or wearing a shirt with tails out.
 This time, when he ordered me to the office, I blasted him with a volley of curses that might have convinced him he should send me to an exorcist rather than to the front office.

 "But not all?"
 "No, not all of them."
 It was getting harder and harder to string thoughts together in a comprehensible manner.

 Alec waited so long to respond that I nearly drifted off.
 "It's always seemed fulfilling.

She abandoned her usual practice of stopping once I missed my first question, and instead continued to grill me, her smile growing each time I failed to answer something correctly.
 My earlier commitment to rededicate myself to school notwithstanding, the weekend hadn't exactly been conducive to mastering the intricacies of our latest subject.
 Her smile was wide indeed by the time the bell finally released me to flee in defeat and embarrassment.
 Alec paced me all the way back to my locker.
 "Is that normal for her?"
 I started to laugh, only to cut the motion short as I realized there was a better than even chance I'd end up crying instead.
 I settled for just nodding as I swapped books and slammed my locker shut.
 Alec pursed his lips for a second and then nodded, not at me, but at whatever decision he'd just made.
 "We'd better get you to your next class.
 Dealing with that will have to wait until later."

 Deeper in the forest, Aurelia stepped out of a glowing blue portal.
 An elf waited there, an ornate bow slung across his back.
 ‚ÄúSo do you think it could be him?‚Äù he asked her.
 ‚ÄúPerhaps,‚Äù Aurelia said.

But, Rodregas, they have Forest and Earth Nymphs and several are children.
 I was raised among AElfin, but these are my people.
 I wish we could do something.‚Äú Rodregas nodded his understanding and said, ‚ÄúI wish we could, but the three of us against a score, the chances of our success is far smaller than the chances of our death.‚Äù He stated in the ‚Äòmatter of fact‚Äô sergeant voice that he knew people would follow.
 Rodregas stood up and started to turn, but while Doi‚Äôvan stood he faced the road and he said, ‚ÄúI have been on this road before, though I did not know then that it was called ‚ÄòThe Princess Road.‚Äô To me it was a road of sorrow.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan was using that flat voice that he used when stating facts.
 ‚ÄúRodregas, you said our odds are bad, but how long shall we wait for the odds to be good?‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs voice dropped the flat tone and started to sound like rocks groaning deep in the earth, as if a great earthquake was coming, ‚ÄúYou believe that a god of the Celestials is behind your survival and that this god wants to see us fight the Immortalists.
 I spent two years of my life in the Menagerie, I swore to myself that given a chance I would see no others be enslaved by the Lord Taiga.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan continued speaking with the same tone as if the earth shook, ‚ÄúI know these caravans.
 The guards will be mostly badly trained human scum armed in leather and with weapons of simple steel.
 The Immortalist scouts are another matter.
 They will be highly trained but still the lowest of the Immortal Guards, mostly with just one or two of the lesser sigils such as strength or one that gives him enhanced senses.
 Against the three of us, a Forest Nymph with a powerful Black Yew bow and a Hellborn Prince of the Orqui and a warrior empowered with a Celestial Lion, are the odds truly that bad?‚Äù Rodregas stood still, surprised by Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs words.

You said last night that your life felt meaningless before I came here, well, mine was even worse.
 The only thing that's kept me sane has been your behind-the-scenes help.
 I want to stay with you.
 I want to be with you."
 Alec studied me for a moment longer, and then nodded, a short, choppy motion with little if any of his usual grace.
 "Very well then.
 It's just after ten o'clock.
 Your mom is about to pull into the driveway.
 Do your best to convince her you spent the night safely at home.
 We'll stay here and watch over the two of you.

The dust would've been plenty bad all by itself, but the heat made things even worse.
 It was only an hour or two removed from the hottest part of the day, and the air was so dry it sucked moisture out of me with each breath.
 I knew it was stupid to walk home.
 My one little bottle of water wasn't going to last me five miles in this oven, but I was tired of always having to be sensible about everything.
 I was going to walk, and that was it.
 Maybe if I passed out on the side of the road and ended up in the hospital Britney would finally realize what a wench she was.
 I was barely out of sight of the school, still vividly imagining Alec and Britney's faces when they found out that they'd put me in the hospital, when I heard a car approaching from behind me.
 Only it wasn't zipping by, it was slowing down.
 Every scary story I'd ever heard about rapists, kidnappers and murderers suddenly flowed through my mind like frayed ropes catching at my insides as they went, pulling out all of the other thoughts and feelings until there was nothing left but a hollow, fear-filled shell.
 I found myself praying for the first time since the accident, pleading with whatever might be out there listening to protect me and get me safely home.

You know him for his albums ‚ÄúRain and Other Distractions‚Äù or ‚ÄúI Was a Child When Smaller.‚Äù  But this is the story of headier days, days when the Overton Park Shell was a magical place, the later rainbow implied.
 When Buddy played lead guitar and sang for Black Lung, a blues rock band with a loyal Memphis following.
 The late Lee Baker, a guitar god himself then, said about Buddy, ‚ÄúHe was the best of us.
 He was a seer, a prophet.
 That later acoustic stuff is crap, of course, but with Black Lung, Buddy was tapped into something other.‚Äù Back then, Black Lung played the Shell regularly, maybe opening for Johnny Winter, or teaming up with Mudboy and The Expanding Head Band for a mini-festival that would start at dusk and stumble into the early morning hours like a dreamer looking for paradise.
 Lot of medicine passed about in those days.
 Lot of prescriptions from the hoodoo man.
 It was the sixties, people, and in Memphis that meant The Strip, The Shell, The Bitter Lemon.
 Buddy was known all those places.
 Hell, Buddy was known everywhere in the River City.

He desperately needed to bandage it but had no time.
 A wave of undead moans reached his sensitive ears.
 Dieredon shuddered.
 ‚ÄúHow many does he command?‚Äù he asked.
 He crouched as he ran, his right arm dragging against the grass.
 Under normal circumstances, he might have been able to hold his own against the undead.
 However, these were not normal circumstances.
 Minutes passed, long and painful.
 The light of Woodhaven beckoned him to his left but he dared not approach.
 Velixar would expect him to flee there, but he was as at home in the wild as he was in any town.

If you were hurt or starved?"
 Marie sighed, wishing she could tell her mother everything.
 But she'd think that Marie had been so traumatized that she'd lost her grip on reality.
 "I wasn't hurt or starved.
 In fact, I was treated very well."
 She pressed her lips together.
 "I accidentally ended up far away from home and couldn't get back.
 I met someone who took care of me and tried to help me.
 We finally found a way."
 "This friend--he was a man?"

Adore through me.
 And if You must, Sweat those drops of blood through me.
 So be it.
 The Danger of Watching Joan of Arcadia
 In Oregon, I‚Äôm speeding alongside one of the many wide and glistening rivers and gazing across at concentric rows of emerald hills at intervals topped with lacy clouds when I catch myself admiring them to such a degree I could call it worship.
 Then something reminds me to turn from worshiping the creation to worshiping its creator.
 To adore a feeling or state of mind, such as the revelation of beauty in nature or the way a lover makes me feel, may involve nothing but selfishness.
 But to adore the creator of that feeling, God for creating nature, a lover for giving me a piece of her heart, or parents for providing warmth and safety, that is appreciation, gratitude, untainted by the selfishness that all sin is made of.
 Maybe if I practice this exercise, try to catch myself in each act of admiration, and turn my worship to the creator, I will gradually learn to adore God the father, and God the spirit.
 But for now, my thoughts drift back to Eric.

I was midway through the first assignment when one of the aides slipped into the room and whispered into Mrs. Campbell's ear.
 There was a kind of muted, collective gasp that made me look up just in time to see the color drain out of her face.
 Before the aide had even finished whispering, Mrs. Campbell was out of her chair and headed towards the door.
 Thirty seconds later we were all still looking around and wondering what had happened.
 It was a testament to our respect for, or in some cases fear of, Mrs. Campbell that nobody spoke in anything above a whisper for an entire five minutes.
 Every terrible thing that could possibly happen to a person flowed through my mind, and all I could do was hope I was overreacting.
 Mrs. Campbell had scared me a little that first day, but she'd been pretty nice since, and she'd always been fair.
 "So what do you think happened?"
 "Britney, what are you doing?"
 "What?

"Payback sucks, doesn't it?"
 Jasmin's complete stillness was an eerie counterpoint to the waves of power still beating at me.
 I somehow knew she was just seconds away from springing when the sound of running footsteps caused all three to turn.
 Alec appeared around the corner, followed by Isaac, just a split second before Brandon sauntered into view from the opposite direction.
 The tingly feeling grew exponentially more powerful with so many more shape shifters present.
 Rubbing my arms did nothing to ward off the feeling that entire colonies of insects were skittering across my skin.
 Mr. Rindell's appearance forestalled what I'd been sure would turn into a full-blown fight.
 He sized up the situation with the canny eye of an educator who'd seen more fights over his career than most gang leaders.
 "Class is about to start, and if every one of you isn't where you're supposed to be before the bell rings, you'll have detention for the next month."
 Vincent's hiss was still almost inaudible.

I will be honest, he is a big ugly brute and not war trained and his Dire blood is marginal.
 But Jordaan thinks he can actually handle Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs weight.
 The Nymphs were not that interested in keeping him because for a Dire steed he is slow.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan said, ‚ÄúA steed that can handle me?
 That would make a nice change of pace.‚Äù Imeralda continued, ‚ÄúHe along with the two best of the slavers‚Äô horses that I claimed.
 That means we now have three decent riding horses.
 Not the Dire war mounts that I know you want, but an upgrade on what we had.
 The local armorer was also able to piece together some steel chain that was decent quality and a good leather harness for Doi‚Äôvan and he was able to repair your armor.
 You now also have some chain that should fit over your leather armor.‚Äù Imeralda added, ‚ÄúI was able to recover only about a score of the arrows, but I have been working with some of the wood nymphs and the armorer and we now have a full set of arrows again.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan, at her motion towards his armor, picked up the pile of chain mail and tried it over his head.
 The opening on top actually fit over his huge head.
 Doi‚Äôvan guessed that it had been the chain of the large overweight slaver that he had killed.

There was no way I could've known that the gray monster who casually sliced through walls and two-by-fours with his wickedly curved claws was Brandon, but I was somehow certain.
 He was built just like Alec had been Friday night, only so much bigger that he had to crouch forward to avoid hitting his head on the unusually high ceilings.
 Donovan faced off against one of the first wolves, but it was obvious he was no match for the grace and power of his opponent.
 The gentle, aging butler was knocked to the ground between one heartbeat and the next.
 I was mercifully spared from seeing the wreckage left when Brandon's wolves moved on, but there was no doubt in my mind that Donovan was dead.
 Screams, distant enough that they had to be coming from the other wing of the house, reached out and pierced my heart.
 There wasn't any way to be sure whether or not it was Rachel or her mother, but ultimately it didn't really matter.
 Brandon was going to kill all of us.
 Another door caved in under a blow from Brandon's fist, and I suddenly realized that he was now standing in the Lilac Room.
 "Spread out and find her."

A word of power sent them flying.
 The elf dropped low, his right leg stretching back as he crouched.
 The bone fragments flew over his head, faster than arrows.
 Then he was up, his bow in hand.
 The string vanished from the bow, spikes pierced the front, and out came the long blades at each side.
 ‚ÄúYou foolish mortal,‚Äù Velixar said.
 His voice was far deeper than before, less like a man and more like a demon.
 ‚ÄúI do not fear your steel.‚Äù
 Pale hands shot upward, hooked in strange formations.
 Dieredon stabbed a long blade straight at the man‚Äôs throat.

Rodregas decided that he would go after Nordien first.
 He would make sure the favorite of Ambassador Van‚Äôdret would not win if nothing else.
 If Geriodon became a knight at least an honorable man had the day.
 Several of the squires were being seen to by attendants making sure everything was secure, and waiting for the start of the match.
 Rodregas thought he was alone until he heard Imeralda speak from behind him, ‚ÄúDid you see who is watching from the Great Hall‚Äôs door?‚Äù she asked.
 Rodregas glanced over, it was Van‚Äôdret.
 He stood tall and handsome, young squires surrounding him ready to serve.
 Rodregas thought that the Immortalist was watching him.
 He would have to leave quickly after the tournament, as the man was growing suspicious of them.
 Rodregas would have loved to kill him, but Van‚Äôdret was a powerful sorcerer capable of magic that made him nearly impossible to kill.

He was reclined on the bench, his feet propped on a low table.
 He didn‚Äôt seem as excited as Ruby had been about our coming trip, so I asked him about it.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just riding the wind, Frey.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, so you don‚Äôt know where we‚Äôre going either?‚Äù He laughed.
 ‚ÄúNo, I know where we are going.
 It‚Äôs only that I don‚Äôt know where we‚Äôll end up.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what was going to happen either.
 I thought of the tracker and realized what a good distraction the book had been.
 ‚ÄúSteed?‚Äù ‚ÄúFrey?‚Äù I smiled but it fell away quickly.

 ‚ÄúWell, there‚Äôs a good chance they‚Äôll be looking for us.‚Äù Of course, and they would all come together.

 Out the window Aurelia stared, frowning as she watched the battle unfold.
 ‚ÄúAurelia,‚Äù called a voice from behind.
 She turned to see a female elf, a friend of hers from many years before she moved to Woodhaven.
 ‚ÄúYes, Felewen?‚Äù
 Felewen stood beside her and faced the window.
 Her hair was tied in a long, black ponytail, her slender figure covered by rare chainmail crafted of the hardest metals known to the intelligent races.
 She had come from deep within Nellassar, the thriving capital of the Dezren elves, as just one of many that had arrived to protect the town.
 ‚ÄúMany are dying,‚Äù Felewen said.
 ‚ÄúThe humans have a spellcaster of their own who repelled our ambush.‚Äù

When I need a break from work or chores, and sometimes while reading or praying, I sit on the back porch like my mom used to do.
 The view was the reason she gave for not selling the house after I left home.
 As I sit and gaze toward the Mexican border, I think of Eric, and how we used to peer through twilight and try to locate his home in the valley about five miles closer to Mexico.
 Which reminds me of Sylvia and how the cruelty of the world drove her crazy, and I wonder if turning to Jesus might have cured her, if she had let him expel her bitterness.
 Because for those who fail to discover peace and even joy in the midst of the cruelty, going mad is only sensible.
 I imagine Eric sitting beside me, wearing the same face as after he pinned me to his living room floor, just before he coached me to believe in myself no matter the evidence that I was a loser.
 Then the expression changes to the one I imagine him wearing when he told Kenny they needed to leave for the desert without Billy and me.
 I get a crazy idea I have never considered before.
 Because Eric and Olga would have loved each other, I bring Olga out of the air and onto the lounge chair beside Eric.
 I give her the face of her last whole day, while she reclined on the couch in the office we were using as a church.

Rodregas thought her name was Tory or Torin, he could not remember which.
 She was an older horse, in her early twenties, and was known for her mild manor.
 She was saddled and ready to go, evidently she was Korin‚Äôs planned mount.
 Rodregas took a deep breath and calmly walked out of the keep and over to the stables.
 It was not large, ordinarily holding only about a dozen horses.
 He looked around to find that it was emptied out, except for the two carriage horses.
 They must have been left in case Ravenhurr wished to travel, which would be unlikely with all his guards and servants scattered over the town, but good servants did not take their master‚Äôs transport from him.
 In the open central area, he saw both the small carriage and the supply wagon that Ravenhurr used for traveling and carry supplies back and forth to the keep.
 He looked at it and smiled.
 With the carriage horses and wagon he could strip a lot of useful items out of the keep.

Mallory tenderly accepted the letter he produced from a pocket somewhere, and then waited while Alec knelt in front of her.
 I felt a tingle of power as Mallory reached out and placed her hands on either side of his face.
 The power surged, and Alec's heavy, cool power was joined by something light and laughing.
 Several seconds later, Mallory released Alec with a sigh and fell back in obvious exhaustion.
 Alec watched intently until she shook her head, and then the mask fell for just a second before he locked it back in place, hiding the disappointment that for the slimmest of moments had been plainly written on his expression.
 Mallory reached out, as if to take Alec's hand, but he gently set her hands back on her lap.
 "Nothing's changed.
 We'll just proceed as before.
 Rest now, and should the worst come to pass I'll send Donovan to you."
 A few seconds later Alec and I were outside the cabin, walking back in the direction of the waiting motorcycle.

Art ‚Äì Well you dangled me on a hook for all that time, only to build up the suspense for your great cure-all concept and then feed me with some nonsense about faith.
 Telling me that I am unconditionally loved by that a man several centuries dead is supposed to cure all my ills?
 How does that work?
 Ned ‚Äì When you realize that Jesus loves you, you will know that all of life‚Äôs problems can be overcome by faith in God, that is how it helps.
 And if you take Jesus into your heart, then God will know that you are ready to receive his help and you will be saved from hell.
 All human discomfort is just a test of strength to sort out the unworthy and separate the wheat from the chaff.
 All humans really need in life is faith!
 Art ‚Äì Humans don‚Äôt need than faith.
 Faith is just a crutch to lean upon.
 A way to convince yourself that there is some reason for all the pain and humiliation.

One in ten jobs is now replaced in OECD countries every year.
 This makes the strengthening of job placement systems a crucial element in any full employment strategy.
 Lack of access to information about job or training opportunities retards re-employment.
 Sweden operates one of the most extensive and efficient employment services, in close cooperation with business, that is responsible for filling 60 per cent of total job vacancies.
 Improve labour market information systems within and between countries by increasing the accuracy and comparability of data, requiring mandatory reporting by businesses of all sizes, and freely exchanging information between cities, states and countries on successful employment-generating strategies.
 8.Raise minimum standards for education: Higher education increases productivity, raises personal expectations and consumption, and generates additional jobs in education and elsewhere.
 Lack of qualifications, inadequate and out-dated skills commonly characterize the long-term unemployed.
 There is a strong positive correlation between higher education and higher incomes.
 The employment rate for college graduates in the United States is 75 per cent versus 48 per cent for high school drop- outs; at the height of the recent recession, 3.2 per cent of college graduates were unemployed compared with 11.4 per cent of high school drop-outs.
 Only 57 per cent of 18-year-olds in the OECD countries are pursuing formal education.

The Dire Cats where magnificent beasts.
 He had no desire to hurt them, and less to be killed by them; but was unsure of how they could share the farm with them.
 Like the barn, the house was made of perfect cut stone that looked almost new; everything else had gone back to nature.
 Rodregas circled around to the back where the stone steps led to the cellar.
 He was sure that originally that there had had doors covering the entrance, but of course, they were long gone.
 Rodregas smelled what he would find well before he came around the corner.
 Next to the entrance was the corpse of a large bear which had recently been killed and partly eaten.
 It had been a magnificent creature, the largest of the local black bears that he had ever seen.
 Rodregas realized that it had been a Dire beast, drawn here by the safe magical energies.
 Next to the dead bear were the two Dire Cats.

‚ÄúI freed them from the dungeon before I left, and then I thought I saw them yesterday.
 Apparently, everyone in the dungeon is following me,‚Äù he said with a chuckle.
 ‚ÄúYou saw them?‚Äù asked Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúNot exactly‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúI saw movement a few times.
 I just thought it might be them.
 I did not know for sure,‚Äù he explained.
 Doi‚Äôvan asked Imeralda, ‚ÄúDid you know they were tracking us?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I had no clue.‚Äù she said looking embarrassed.
 She then added, ‚ÄúI am not really a great tracker.
 I mean, our Paladin was easy enough to find but tracking Dire Cats through the forest, that would require true skill.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut you did not sense them at all?‚Äù asked the Hellborn again.

 Red eyes watched from afar, their owner relishing the carnage amid the dying torchlight.
 A smile grew on his ever-changing face.
 ‚ÄúBeautiful,‚Äù Velixar whispered as the number of dead grew.
 Shifting sighs and mindless moans drifted from behind.
 Velixar glanced back at his companions, who now numbered in the thousands.
 ‚ÄúSurround the town,‚Äù he commanded them.
 The nearest nodded, the movement swinging the entirety of his rotting face.
 He moaned to the others, sending them in motion.

 He did as commanded, and that fact disturbed him greatly.

‚ÄúYour voice or your life,‚Äù Qurrah said, danger flaring in his eyes.
 The half- orc pushed him away and got to his feet.
 He glanced around, trying to orientate himself, when he felt a sharp pain stab into his back.
 He spun, his whip lashing out as it burst into flame.
 It wrapped around the man‚Äôs neck, choking out death cries as his flesh seared and smoke filled his lungs.
 The only noise Qurrah heard was the sound of skin blistering and popping in the fire.
 At last the man crumpled, the bloodied shard of glass from the bottle still in his hand.
 ‚ÄúDamn it,‚Äù Qurrah said, wincing as he touched the cut on his back.
 It was wide but not deep.
 Painful too, he noticed as he took a few steps.

Brandon's expression was confident and a little smug, and I somehow didn't doubt in the slightest that he'd expected Alec to calmly hand over two people to be executed.
 Alec hadn't even flinched at the demand.
 "Your wolves were lawbreakers who were executed before they could break further laws.
 The protection of the people, of the secrets that guard our nature from the dayborn, represents a law that supersedes any question of territory or dominance."
 The energy suddenly rolling off of the gathered shape shifters nearly drove me to my knees as Alec continued.
 "By their actions Adriana Paige learned of our nature, and it was only by the grace of the Maker that I was able to stop them from killing her.
 Their deaths were an unavoidable price to save an innocent."
 Some of the faces across the circle from me flinched a little, and I had a moment to wonder if Brandon hadn't told them the truth about what'd happened.
 "Her life belonged to me, it was mine to dispose of as I saw fit."
 I opened my mouth to protest, but closed it at a sharp jab in the ribs from Rachel.

At the same time, this incredible advance has been accompanied by events that have destabilized the political and economic systems of the entire region, led to the break-up of the USSR, war in Bosnia, the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the COMECON trade system, a massive brain drain and the threat of huge waves of economic refugees.
 These changes, too, have had implications for all nations within the region and beyond ‚Äì severely affecting trade around the world, from the tea estates of Sri Lanka and India to the wheat fields of the United States, Australia and Argentina.
 So, too, the further course of this transition will have a profound impact on all nations, both developed and developing.
 The future of world peace, the world political system and the world economy hang in the balance.
 A successful rapid transition will open up new markets to stimulate a new round of growth for the sluggish economies of the West, much as the Mar shall Plan stimulated American prosperity in the 1950s.
 It will equally present economic opportunities for developing countries unable as yet to meet the quality requirements of highly competitive Western markets.
 Failure of the transition holds the danger of economic collapse and political instability within Eastern Europe, which could even lead to renewed political tensions and an other economically devastating arms race.
 Already ongoing wars are being fought in the Balkans, the Caucasus and several other regions of the former Soviet Union.
 Crime is on the rise.
 Ominous signs have appeared that the authoritarian past is not yet fully buried and could once again arise, if the forward momentum of the transition process does not quickly improve the lives of people within the region.

He burned so deeply that no scream crossed his lips.
 He felt every fiber of his being simply burn.
 Rodregas tried to scream, but no sound could pass his lips.
 CHAPTER 2 FROM THE ASHES
 When Rodregas awoke he was confused about why he was lying on the floor.
 As he opened his eyes he was also alarmed to see Captain Poir looking down at him with a confused and worried expression.
 Captain Poir said, ‚ÄúMaster Ravenhurr?‚Äù It was a question.
 Rodregas wondered why his captain would think he was the Master.
 And then suddenly it all rushed back to him, all the details of the final ceremony.
 ‚ÄúOh my gods he had burned!‚Äù Rodregas thought in alarm.

His eyes burned with intensity; they seemed even darker now.
 Dark‚Ä¶ like mine.
 I looked away.
 Steed broke in through the trees, gesturing toward the direction he‚Äôd come from.
 ‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt far.
 Ready and able for a morning adventure.‚Äù As he approached, he glanced at me and then Chevelle, still close beside me.
 ‚ÄúWe can get an early start.‚Äù He lifted a pack from beside the fire and said, ‚ÄúBluebell?‚Äù I stood, following this stranger without question, not missing the irritation on Chevelle‚Äôs face.
 He unclasped the pack to roll the blankets out with a flip, smiling and nodding good evening before stepping away from my hastily constructed hut.
 I unlaced my vest and threw it down, kicked off my shoes and fell into the blankets, stretching happily to finally have something like an actual bed.
 The conversation outside quieted and I slipped off to sleep, trying not to think about my capture and coming return to the village.

 The pages hadn't changed since the last time he'd read them.
 There was no mention of her life after age 23.
 He read the material more carefully, and then he reread it.
 He was actually rather relieved that he didn't have to read about her husband and children, but it seemed odd that the pages hadn't changed when she'd gone back.
 He snorted, shaking his head.
 What was really odd was that the pages had changed to begin with, that the information about her marriage had disappeared when she'd walked into 2011.
 And that, of course, had been the biggest oddity of all.

While under the spell of that malady, I came upon 1 John 4:18 in the King James version: ‚ÄúThere is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment.
 He that feareth is not made perfect in love.‚Äù I can testify that fear has torment, even that fear is torment.
 And since I suffered and recovered from panic attacks, I feel qualified to offer a remedy.
 Back then, I often read The Daily Word, which frequently repeated the message, ‚ÄúLet go and let God.‚Äù What we churchgoing folk might call surrender.
 Surrender is the remedy, at least for panic attacks.
 Maybe for everything.
 As I pass the turnoff to my former home in Chico, I think, surrender must make perfect sense to anyone who adores God like Brother Lawrence did.
 When we are around someone we adore, our defenses cave in, because the only thing we fear, the only thing that needs defending, is the communion with the one we adore.
 If we adore God and live in His presence, we are in constant communion with the eternal, way beyond death.
 So, what‚Äôs left to fear.

It was an art gallery.
 One covered in pictures that were eerily familiar, all with a circular signature at the bottom right hand corner.
 They were mostly of mundane kinds of things, landscapes, or people, but there were overtones that caressed a hidden chord inside my soul.
 Everything was done in drab, painfully boring colors, overlaid with incredibly vibrant, hues that were almost unreal in their perfection.
 It wasn't until I'd moved around a corner and entered what looked like a new phase for the painter that I figured out why the paintings looked so familiar despite the fact that I'd never seen any of the places or people depicted.
 The realization hit with such force that it distracted me from the familiarity of the signature.
 The new pieces were all breathtaking.
 The drab colors were gone, leaving scenes made up of multi-hued strands of light.
 It was like waking up and having someone tell you they'd been reading your mind.
 The pieces weren't of specific places or events from my dreams, but they were an exact match for how they'd looked and felt.

What would you like to buy?"
 They wandered around, and what caught her eye was not all the silver, gold, turquoise, and leather that the natives thought an American tourist would want but the colorful things like serapes and bajas--Mexican blankets and pullover jackets.
 She found a pink and turquoise baja that she fell in love with.
 The price was ten dollars, and Marie talked the owner down to six dollars.
 "I did it!"
 she exclaimed, taking her baja from the bag.
 "You did a good job."
 "This is fun.
 Why don't we get you one of these?"
 After buying Rick a baja, they bought a multi-colored blanket and a leather purse.

Did he like being kissed on the neck as much as she did?
 Just the memory of his kisses made her heart race.
 They had coffee and dessert in the living room.
 "What a pretty sculpture," Marie said, admiring a small porcelain garden filled with flowers and a water wheel.
 "Clap your hands," Teri told her.
 "What?"
 "Clap your hands."
 Marie did so, and music played as water began to make the water wheel turn.
 "Oh!
 It's a fountain!

Ruby offered Chevelle a drink and he sat in a chair beside mine.
 She prattled as she enjoyed the wine, and I tried to focus on her stories instead of the occasional glances he threw my way.
 And then he grabbed my arm.
 I flinched, afraid at the quickness and strength of the move, but he only trailed an index finger gently down my arm, over the design, to stop in the center of my palm.
 My arm relaxed into his grip.
 ‚ÄúYou like it?
 Ruby did it.
 It‚Äôs beautiful, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù His finger stayed on my palm as he looked up at me.
 His eyes lingered on my mouth for a moment and then met mine, piercing.
 ‚ÄúA hawk?‚Äù It seemed like an accusation, but I had no idea why.

Elves battled in the street, horribly outnumbered.
 They were skilled, though, and a steady stream of arrows from homes continued to weaken the human forces.
 ‚ÄúHalt here,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 To their right was a two-story elven home.
 Three bowmen fired from the windows at a party of fifteen soldiers.
 The men of Neldar had their shields raised high, but the synergy between the elves in the home and the elves on the street was superb.
 The Tun brothers watched the sword wielders on the ground dance in, make a few precise swings to change the positioning of the shields, and then dart away.
 Arrows quickly followed these maneuvers, biting into exposed flesh.
 Qurrah motioned to the building housing the archers.
 ‚ÄúGo inside.

‚ÄúIt seems it may have taken your magic completely this time.‚Äù This time.
 I concentrated on keeping my head straight, to look like I was listening properly, acting properly.
 My attempt at concentration must have come across as anxiety.
 ‚ÄúYou found a way to break their bonds before.
 You will again.‚Äù I nodded.
 My nose was itchy.
 I wiggled it.
 ‚ÄúRest now,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúWe have time.‚Äù I reached forward, ready to ask him to stay, but he wasn‚Äôt leaving.
 He only settled in.

‚ÄúHow much detail do you want?‚Äù I giggled.
 He smiled as he started into the subject, explaining what he‚Äôd been taught about breeding techniques and dominant traits when he was young.
 His father had imparted to him all he had learned in his lifetime and all their ancestors had passed down before.
 They bred the animals methodically, striving to combine certain traits, bring them together in a single horse.
 With each generation, they strengthened the line, even bringing in new breeds from other lands to add to the list of desired attributes.
 Smoother gait, better endurance, stronger health, longer life.
 I faded off somewhere during the part about bloodlines.
 I woke late in the evening when Ruby switched places with Steed.
 She had brought some meat back with her and we supped together before I headed off to bed.
 Ruby didn‚Äôt question why I would be sleeping again so soon.

He'd just started listing microwave products in his mind when Marie returned.
 He rose and went to hug her.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, immediately kicking himself for his hypocrisy.
 She sighed, letting herself be comforted by his embrace.
 August was just around the corner now, and she and her mother normally spent August at Cape Cod.
 Her father joined them on weekends.
 They wouldn't go there this year‚Äînot with her still missing.
 She'd been gone five weeks now.
 Five weeks and two days.
 And they had no idea what had happened to her.

"Monster Lake."
 Every single birthday I could remember had involved some kind of trip out to Monster Lake.
 Picnics had swapped off with treasure hunts and then been replaced by other activities depending on Dad's mood and my age.
 My subconscious had keyed in on the one scene guaranteed to make me feel miserable.
 "Was that close to your house in Minnesota?
 I..." Whatever else Alec was saying was lost to the roar in my ears, caused as always by my racing heart.
 I didn't even have a chance to try and fight the attack.
 By the time I realized I was in trouble, papers were flying off my desk and the floor was racing up to meet me.
 Rather than swimming around in blackness like I normally did when collapsed, this time there was just nothing.
 One second I was falling, the next I was opening my eyes and looking up at Alec.

He gulped the swirling blue-silver contents and then tossed the vial.
 Ripping the other arrow out of his side, he felt a warm, soothing sensation fill his body.
 ‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù he heard a raspy voice ask from atop the stairs.
 ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm fine.
 Just had to take care of something here.‚Äù
 He trudged down the stairs to where Qurrah waited.
 ‚ÄúHow many did you kill?‚Äù the necromancer asked.
 ‚ÄúJust two,‚Äù he replied.
 His skeptical brother raised an eyebrow.
 ‚ÄúThat is a lot of blood for just two.‚Äù

I could use some magic, I had lost some memories.
 No, that isn‚Äôt true, is it?
 I couldn‚Äôt really remember anything from before the village.
 Anything except the dreams.
 ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm sure you want to be unbound?‚Äù Why is that a question?
 ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù He nodded as if he were going down a checklist.
 ‚ÄúWe know council has bound you.‚Äù I waited for the next detail, my fingers curling into my palms.
 ‚ÄúAnd we know they must be the one or ones to unbind you.‚Äù Some part of me realized the seriousness of the conversation, but all I could do was listen.
 ‚ÄúThey are, obviously‚Ä¶ unwilling.‚Äù The breath I drew was too sharp.

‚ÄúA present from a half-orc,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúShould I be worried?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúNope.
 Just take it.‚Äù He held out a small brown box.
 It was in poor shape, picked out of a heap of trash, but the elf could see the great care spent attempting to clean and fix it.
 ‚ÄúWhat is inside?‚Äù she asked as she took the box.
 ‚ÄúOpen it,‚Äù Harruq said.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see.‚Äù
 Aurelia pried off the lid and peered inside.
 A small bouquet of flowers lay on the bottom of the box.

A hero‚Äôs welcome awaited me, as my son was so thankful for what I had done for him.
 As I went to bed that night, my mind would not shut off and the events of that evening replayed in my head over and over again.
 I lay awake for hours wondering what would have happened if the dealer hadn‚Äôt run into the cops.
 They both confessed to the drug deal when separately interrogated.
 The officer said they had less than half of the money, which she had attempted to hide in a trash can in the Starbucks‚Äô bathroom, and Steve had a gun, which Ashley admitted they would have used if I didn‚Äôt give them the drugs once I discovered they were short on cash.
 They were going to rob me at gunpoint!
 I had literally dodged a bullet.
 Part II: After the Bust Chapter 21: When You Least Expect It The next morning I woke up before my wife and son.
 After I brewed my morning coffee, I walked down the hall and back into my bedroom where I kept the drug test in my closet.
 I walked into Brandon‚Äôs room and told him to wake up and urinate in the test cup.

It was like he had a split personality.
 When he was thinking about it, he was ultra-careful not to do anything to deepen the Ja'tell bond.
 Other times, usually when he was thinking about something else, he'd unconsciously reach out to me.
 I still wasn't sure which option I preferred.
 Every moment we spent together made me want to touch him that much more, but the idea of being addicted to anyone, even him, was more than a little unsettling.
 "Sure, Rachel tells me I'm entirely unreasonable on at least a daily basis."
 I stuck my tongue out at him, and started back through the book in search of the missing information.
 There were so many other ways I'd rather be spending our time together, but he was adamant I not fall further behind in my classes.
 I looked up to ask for a hint, and found him staring off into space.
 "Penny for your thoughts?"

 "Let's see what's on now."
 "You mean there's another picture now?"
 He laughed.
 "There's something on 24 hours a day."
 "Really?"
 She beamed with delight.
 "Is there something funny playing?"
 He found an "I Love Lucy" rerun listed and changed channels.
 For the next hour he got more pleasure from watching Marie watch the program than he could possibly have gotten from the program itself.

Apparently Alec's presence was proof against a second near attack today.
 "I don't know.
 We always used to do the standard kind of stuff.
 Presents, eggnog and the Christmas story.
 Usually Dad made us breakfast Christmas morning and then we'd drive out of the city later in the day and go sledding.
 I hadn't thought about what it would be like this year."
 Alec nodded like he'd just checked a box off on some kind of mental list.
 "So snow's always been a pretty key ingredient sounds like."
 "I guess.
 It hadn't really sunk in that we wouldn't be getting any of that this year.

I see nothing but black stone.‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Rodregas exclaimed.
 ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt see that door?‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan and he shared a look of confusion.
 The three walked back to the door that Doi‚Äôvan had found, and could clearly see.
 Rodregas waited as Doi‚Äôvan touched the handle but stopped him before he opened it.
 ‚ÄúDo you see anything?‚Äù he asked.
 Imeralda eyes opened wide when Doi‚Äôvan fully opened the doors and revealed the room.
 It was in style identical to the first room of the Celestial Beasts except instead of great beasts on pedestals, it held crouching daemons in pits.
 The previous vague smell of brimstone and hellfire wafted fully into the room.
 Doi‚Äôvan and Rodregas stepped into the room but paused when Imeralda did not follow.

I blinked, and his human body had been replaced with the hybrid form that'd saved my life once before.
 Only this time he wasn't fighting wolves, he was fighting another hybrid, and Brandon towered over him.
 There was another ripple of movement on the other side of the light.
 Jasmin and Dom both pulled away from me, joining the other three, facing outward in preparation for the inevitable attack.
 Vincent's dark form inched slightly closer, but Brandon's growl froze his henchman in place.
 The complete stillness that resulted was suddenly shattered by a flash of heat lightning off to the east, and when the spots cleared from my vision, the two hybrids were a blur of motion.
 Merely human eyes never could've hoped to follow all of the action.
 I got the feeling Alec's technique was superior.
 He moved from spot to spot, motion to motion with the smooth economy of a tree bending before the wind, but if he was a tree, Brandon was the hurricane.
 Flare-light reflected off of deadly claws, and blood splattered the earth as Brandon drove Alec before him.

I raced through the crowds, jumping and ducking.
 I looked over my shoulder and up the hill, wishing I could escape all the bodies that were pressed together in combat.
 Then I rammed into one.
 ‚ÄúWhat the heck?‚Äù I fell on my butt and blinked as Jason picked himself off the ground.
 ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I said and stood up.
 ‚ÄúWatch where you‚Äôre going‚Ä¶ Jazell, look out!‚Äù Jason suddenly yelled.
 I dove onto the ground and felt the monster brush past me.
 I looked up to see Jason rolling on the ground before jumping on the faery jerk‚Äôs back.
 He yelled at Jason right before I saw the knife disappear somewhere in his neck.
 The faery‚Äôs yells turned to screams and then nothing.

‚ÄúI know you don‚Äôt like my servants being a Hellborn and a Nymph,‚Äù he said keeping his voice light.
 ‚ÄúBut they are my sworn men and I trust them; and it is my call.
 Now open the doors.‚Äù At the last part he let a sergeant‚Äôs voice ring out and it was more order than request.
 And like all good soldiers they immediately carried out his order.
 The door had a strange mechanism such as Rodregas had never seen before.
 Gorin lifted a large handle and solid squares of iron slid out of the floor and the ceiling.
 When both the top and the bottom fully released the guard pushed the doors wide.
 The three immediately pushed through and Rodregas said, ‚ÄúYou can close the doors.
 I will pound on them when we are ready to leave.‚Äù And with a nervous nod the doors slid closed behind them.
 As the door closed Gorin hastily added, ‚ÄúRemember not to touch anything until the Grand Marshal is present.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan nodded at the now closed doors and raised his torch.

‚ÄúWhat are these?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúThe human alphabet.

 He protested, but it was a weak protest.
 They went over the alphabet several times until Harruq could repeat most without thinking too hard.
 ‚ÄúI want you to take it home with you,‚Äù she said when they were done.
 To her annoyance, Harruq refused to accept the book.
 ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt want to take it,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWell I, just‚Ä¶‚Äù His face turned a mixture of gray and red.

God I feel good.
 Fantastic weather we‚Äôre having!
 So how was your day?
 Character 2- That was a tic-tac box wasn‚Äôt it.
 What are you trying to pull?

 That was a tic-tac box, yes, but I was only eating them as a symbol of my medicine.

Steve was tasked with introducing undercover officers into the inner circle that would eventually lead to a bust that appeared to be far removed from the original contact with Steve.
 The only problem with Steve is that he was double-crossing the narcotics officers and they had come to discover his deception.
 Steve and his girlfriend, Ashley were highly addicted to Oxy and their combined drug habit made it necessary for him to continue to deal Oxy to the bigger buyers while tossing a few small fish to the officers to appease them and satisfy his deal.
 The officers knew too that Steve was beating his girlfriend and forcing her to perform ‚Äúhappy ending massages‚Äù and sexual favors to support her personal addiction to Oxy.
 Brandon was one of the small fish that Steve provided information on.
 Brandon had become so addicted that he could no longer supply the drug in quantity because he and Tiffanie consumed over $1000 a day by snorting or smoking it.
 Brandon had gone from a large dealer to a junkie who would do anything, say anything and sell anything to get his next fix.
 Brandon had become dispensable to Steve and the other large dealers, as he was now an Oxy addicted con man in constant search of his next dose of this potent drug.
 Brandon could trade prison for setting up the double-crosser Steve.
 Officer White was insistent that the time frame for this deal was short.

My room became Raskolnikov's basement garret.
 If my mom dared enter to bring me a sandwich, I grabbed the plate, shooed her out, shut the door, and usually didn't bother to eat.
 Early in the novel Raskolnikov is in a tavern with a drunk, Marmeledov, whose daughter Sonia has prostituted herself for the money to feed her destitute step-mother and brothers and sisters.
 Marmeledov tells of a dream in which God sets straight the wise men who object to his accepting Sonia into glory: "Here is why, oh you wise, here is why, oh you of understanding‚Äî-her sins which are many are forgiven for she has loved much."
 I jotted the quote on a slip of paper and kept it in my wallet until it disintegrated.
 The only time in my rather lengthy existence I have so treasured an idea.
 Liz wanted more attention from me than I wanted to give.
 But we played fairly well together until, one Sunday evening, I wanted to go to a certain dance, which was held weekly and at which I always danced with other girls in addition to Liz.
 This time, Liz wanted me to myself, at her place.
 Her folks were out of town.

Colors swam across his eyes.
 His ears, incredibly sensitive even compared to other elves, strained for the sound of approaching dead.
 He heard nothing but a strange ringing inside his skull.
 It seemed he had put more distance between them than he first thought.
 A footstep fell beside his head.
 His heart and lungs halted.
 The pain had diminished his skills.
 They were atop him, but he dared not move.
 He sent a silent prayer to Celestia as more footfalls clomped all around him.
 He guessed at least ten.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are searching for a good place to start over,‚Äù he explained.
 I was scrutinizing his blade.
 ‚ÄúOh, well, I‚Äôm hunting.‚Äù He wasn‚Äôt as slow as I had thought, quite capable of conversation.
 I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder, ‚ÄúYou were a bit‚Ä¶ stunned before?‚Äù He flushed a pleasing shade of red.
 ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs just that you are quite beautiful.

So when they got home and Marie put her arms around his neck, obviously ready to pick up where they'd left off, he held her away.
 "We need to talk about this."
 She kissed his chin.
 "About what?"
 "Kissing.
 Touching.
 Let's sit down."
 They sat facing each other on the sofa, and Marie reached out to caress his face.
 "Couldn't we kiss and touch instead of talking about it?"
 He took her hand from his cheek, squeezing it.

Investment in education and training helped Thailand raise labour productivity by 63 per cent during 1980‚Äì5.
 It, too, is moving from a labour surplus to a labour shortage economy.
 An enormous range and depth of physical, technical, organizational, managerial and social skills are needed in order to utilize constructively the freedom which democracy provides, the productive power of new technologies, and the efficiency of modern institutions and systems to achieve greater developmental results.
 These skills admit of constant and continuous improvement without limit, in the same way that technology and organization can always be further improved.
 A comparative survey of the level and quality of skills in any country with those of countries above and below it on scales of economic and human development will reveal the crucial role of skills in development.
 A scale of progression on key skills can help every country identify its relative position, assess the scope for further progress and evolve strategies to fill the gap.
 Raising the skills of society to those of countries higher up on the scale will enable the country to move to that higher level.
 Despite enormous expansion of educational and training institutions, most developing countries suffer from a shortage of quality vocational skills among the huge number of people at lower levels of the society who seek desperately to raise their standard of living.
 This shortage retards the growth in productivity and quality needed to meet domestic needs and achieve international competitiveness.
 The technical training in frastructure in these countries should be expanded by the establishment of craft and vocational training institutes at the local level in every community to impart a wide range of basic technical skills.

Where I'm stuck is: the Brother explains that his desire to live in faithful, relentless companionship with God began with adoration.
 I wish I knew French and could read the original.
 But it has taken me decades to gain a meager command of Spanish.
 So I resort to an English dictionary, look up "adore" and all I find are synonyms: worship; revere, venerate; and one somewhat helpful description: deep, rapturous love.
 That one rings truest.
 According to my vocabulary, if we adore something, we are drawn to it and resist separation.
 Its presence comforts, inspires, provides us with hope and meaning.
 The thought of losing it may terrify or leave us in despair.
 I feel all that about my kids.
 I have felt somewhat the same about a few others, at least for a time.

I pulled out my notes and started reviewing what I'd managed to learn about our project, stalling until he arrived so I could give him a piece of my mind.
 Only he never walked through the door.
 I still had my anger, but it wasn't cushioning me as well for some reason.
 It felt like another attack was on the way.
 My pulse was skyrocketing and the room wavered as my vision dimmed.
 It didn't make sense to be having a panic attack right now, but images of Cindi swam into view, alternating with pictures of Alec and Rachel.
 It was like Alec's cruelty to his sister somehow meant I was failing Cindi.
 I concentrated all of my energy on thinking about Alec, about how much I hated him, about what I was going to say to him next time I saw him.
 Beyond all expectations, it worked.
 My heart rate slowed down to something approaching normal, and the room stopped moving around.

I held my breath for what I was sure was impending, and painful, death, and saw it again.
 I released the breath, which was not, in fact, my last.
 A soft white rabbit loped in front of the bushes I‚Äôd posted for a doorway.
 My stomach was interested, but I‚Äôd never prepared meat.
 I‚Äôd only ever gathered berries and vegetables that someone else had grown.
 I didn‚Äôt have the first idea how to make a bow, let alone shoot one, and I‚Äôd never killed anything.
 Except plants.
 And a bird.
 But I had no idea if an animal killed by magic was edible.
 I thought of the thistle, its black roots, how it had turned to ash.

Unless UN member states invest international institutions with the necessary authority and meet their financial commitments to support them, the world will continue to drift and flounder, powerless to oppose petty dictators and ruthless aggression.
 Unless a cooperative world military force comes into existence, every country will continue to be burdened with the enormous expense and insecurity characteristic of the old system.
 Perhaps more than any other institution, the military has under stood and demonstrated the enormous power of organization to accomplish a goal.
 The Gulf War was a dramatic illustration of the importance of reliable information, perfect planning, logistical support systems, effective chains of command and swift responsiveness to changing situations.
 If humankind could mobilize and apply the same efficiency to the war on poverty and unemployment that it has exhibited in preparing for and waging military wars against each other, very soon there would be no more poverty or unemployment to fight.
 During the Second World War Ford Motors converted from manufacture of cars for the masses to making trucks and airplanes for the military, producing B-24 bombers at the rate of one per hour from a single production plant.
 If conversion from civilian to military production could be carried out by so many countries within one or two years, it must be possible to convert the military from war-based to peace-based applications, and defence industries from military to civilian production, within half a decade.
 That requires human resourcefulness in organizational innovation.
 Organization is the means by which people work together cooperatively to achieve common goals and, in the process, to serve society in a wide range of functions.
 The achievement of food security and full employment depends on the establishment of new types of public and private organizations ‚Äì commercial, financial, industrial, export, research, educational and training.

I had undergone hours of ‚Äúevaluations‚Äù under the scrutiny of Council members.
 Exams and trials and endless questions.
 Black blots on parchment that made abstract shapes.
 ‚ÄúWhat do you see, Elfreda?‚Äù I knew what they wanted to hear‚Äîbutterfly and flower species.
 But I was so resentful toward Fannie for putting me there, I usually saw a black blob of death consuming her.
 ‚ÄúA Monarch,‚Äù I‚Äôd say.
 She looked beyond me at the few inches of open floor, and I took the opportunity to bolt past her down the hall, straight out the door at full speed.
 I ran from the house, ignoring the paths; other elves would be no help to me.
 I kept running until I was certain she wasn‚Äôt coming, and then I collapsed at the edge of a meadow, breathless.
 I dropped my face into my hands, and might have wept if I‚Äôd not been so fueled by fear and adrenaline.

 Antonil stared at the small town, seeing very little motion within.
 No people wandered the streets.
 No traveling merchants hawked their wares.
 He sighed and turned to Sergan, his trusted advisor in war.
 The man was old, scarred, and had dirty hair falling down to his shoulders.
 He had seen many wars, and the axe against his shoulder had claimed more than a few lives.
 ‚ÄúYes, let us end this, one way or the other,‚Äù Antonil said.
 ‚ÄúOrder them to march.

But what is the One Tree?
 It is not a beast of a realm, it is the symbol of the Nymph people.
 It can‚Äôt be a sigil, can it?‚Äù she asked.
 Neither Doi‚Äôvan nor Rodregas answered and the three of them stood there, each caught up in their own thoughts.
 Finally, Doi‚Äôvan spoke, ‚ÄúI am going to see what lies in this Chamber.
 Will you be alright?‚Äù he asked Imeralda.
 She nodded and seemed relieved as she headed right for the doorway of the One Tree.
 Rodregas feared for her.
 He was not sure what the consequences would be if she touched the One Tree.
 He wanted to follow her, but he followed Doi‚Äôvan into the Infernal chamber instead.

The number of people who proceeded to come into the tutoring lab was nothing less than amazing.
 Based on overheard conversations, it sounded like there was a perfect storm of tests.
 Both of the other math teachers were apparently having tests in every single one of their classes, and Mrs. Campbell was having tests in a couple of hers as well.
 The resulting number of questions kept us all jumping.
 I started work half an hour early, and Albert, Peter and Mrs. Campbell all stayed an extra forty-five minutes.
 I was helping out an undersized freshman who was having a really hard time understanding the fundamental concepts of the unit she was going to be tested over tomorrow when Mrs. Campbell stopped by.
 "We're all done.
 Wait until the end of your normal shift, and then go home.
 If anyone complains feel free to suggest that they don't leave it until the last minute next time."
 There was plenty of grumbling when I announced that the lab was over, but nobody actually said anything.

I'll go try the others."
 They bought the bigger pair and two shirts, and Marie wore the jeans and the red and navy shirt from the store.
 "Thank you for the clothes, Rick," she said, smiling up at him.
 "You're welcome.
 Do you like them?"
 "Very much."
 She sighed.
 "But I suppose I shouldn't take them back with me."
 "Why?"
 "I could never wear the trousers."

As I stared at the empty space where he'd been standing just a second before, I felt my chest start to constrict, and my breathing speed up.
 The sense of terror racing along my synapses was completely irrational, and extraordinarily powerful.
 Just as the room began to spin crazily around me, I felt a gentle touch on my shoulder.
 "Mistress Paige, is there anything I can get you?
 Something to eat perhaps?
 Or if you'd rather, I can show you to the theater."
 I chopped off a hysterical burst of laughter just before it managed to emerge full force and totally embarrass me.
 Of course Alec had a theater in his house.
 Probably a pool and a gym too.
 Along with a half-dozen other amenities I'd never think of, but that the ultra-rich simply couldn't do without.

Jesus, says this astute theologian, attempted to give people freedom, when most of them want nothing to do with freedom.
 Their cravings are for food and other comforts, for easy answers to questions no matter how complex or perplexing, and for entertainment, to relieve them of the need to think.
 Eric, like Jesus, loved people too much to usurp their freedom by giving them what their lesser natures wanted.
 The End of the World
 During summer before our senior year, Eric worked as lifeguard at Carmen Ranch Club.
 The first few weeks, on his days off, we hung out at La Jolla Shores.
 While Eric worked, I often helped Cliff and Bill Torrey and their dad rebuild a ‚Äô56 Thunderbird.
 Sometimes I visited my cousin Jill at her Pacific Beach apartment.
 Jill was nineteen.
 One Friday evening, she hosted a party.

Anvil was holding her back, Rune with magic.
 She snapped and they saw her power.
 Some denied the possibility but not my father.
 He has attained his prize, that which he has always coveted.
 I will stop him.
 ~ The plan is forming, but I am unsure whether it will work.
 I know I cannot defeat him, and his guard, alone.
 But I must protect my Freya.
 I must protect us all.
 It is the want of power that will consume us.

 Harruq viciously plucked blades of grass.
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù
 Aurelia stared at Harruq for a while, her eyes probing.
 The half-orc endured the gaze, concentrating fully on his grass-removing project.
 ‚ÄúI would feel better having met your brother,‚Äù she said at last.
 ‚ÄúBut you may take as long as you wish.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúGood.
 Can we spar now?‚Äù

Acknowledgments: A big thanks to all of the fans who are doing so much to help get the word out.
 There are tons of you that I don't know, but I do want to make special mention of a few dependable souls that I'm very grateful to know, and who've helped in various ways with Torn, and who I suspect will continue to go above and beyond with Broken.
 Cassy & Mark, I'm glad you both turned out to be story addicts just like me.
 Thanks for everything.
 Dad, not everyone gets to be best friends with their parents.
 Thanks for all of the feedback and the ongoing support.
 Mimi, thanks for sticking with me long enough to get addicted and to fix some of my biology facts along the way.
 As always, Katie deserves special thanks.
 Without her, Alec and Adri's story never would have seen the light of day.
 Thanks need to be expressed to Obsidian Dawn, www.obsidiandawn.com, for brushes used in the creation of Broken's cover.

 "Well, sort of.

 Most programs are shorter--half an hour or an hour."
 He went to get the TV guide and found the listing for Saturday evening.
 A western had come on at 9:00.
 That would be a good place to begin, since it was set before 1927.
 "I think you'll like this western," he told her, turning on the TV with the remote.
 She stared at the little box in his hand.
 "Did that box make the picture appear?"

‚ÄúAnd make no mistakes.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWe will not,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúHow will I know where this Ahrqur lives?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI will show you, my disciple, but first I have a gift for my dearest bone general.‚Äù
 Velixar drew out his magical chest.
 He set it beside him and let it grow out to normal size.
 From within he pulled out a suit of armor stained a deep shade of black.
 He threw it to Harruq, who managed to catch it even though his mouth hung wide open.
 ‚ÄúThe first Horde War was caused by a disciple of mine,‚Äù the man in black explained.
 ‚ÄúHe blessed the armor of one of the leaders of the orcish clans.

Unfortunately, Mr. Whethers wasn't there.
 The substitute teacher sitting at his desk didn't even take roll; he just shut the door, told us to keep it down, and flipped open a magazine.
 While I was sitting at my desk wondering what to do with the next hour of my life, something I'd read in the physics book suddenly clicked.
 In a perfect world I would've been left in peace to finish reasoning out the answer.
 Instead, Britney leaned over and smiled.
 "So I was really surprised to see you with Brandon.
 I thought for sure he'd be pissed after you made Cassie back down like that."
 "Surprise, surprise, maybe he isn't as shallow and vindictive as you thought."
 The words were mean, but they felt good.
 There were a lot of other, even worse things on the tip of my tongue, things I really wanted to say.

 Art ‚Äì Nope.
 Dad only ever dated one girl, and he ended up marrying her.

They had no idea there was a‚Ä¶ human‚Ä¶ growing in the belly my hands now cradled.
 I listened as their voices began, and then rose, clamorously discussing the news and what it could bring.
 I cringed as their words turned to the possibilities, the power I might pass down, the strength the new one might bring.
 ‚ÄúWe will leave at daybreak,‚Äù Grey informed Ruby as I read.
 Perfect.
 The news brought on nothing but worry, so I went back to the book.
 Eventually, my father did seek to find out who the father was.
 I refused to tell him anything and he could not force me in my condition.
 I could see his plans for it already forming.
 I was almost happy it would not be powerful, half human and unmagical.

He's only a bit past middle age for one of us."
 I nearly protested, but Alec was right, it would take an actual order to get Donovan to slow down, and two days was probably pushing it.
 Donovan somehow managed to respectfully circumvent any order he thought prevented him from taking adequate care of Alec's family.
 "Tell me about Christmas at the Paige house."
 I blinked a couple of times.
 The progress I'd made lately notwithstanding, I half expected the question to drive me into a panic attack.
 Apparently Alec's presence was proof against a second near attack today.
 "I don't know.
 We always used to do the standard kind of stuff.
 Presents, eggnog and the Christmas story.

She'd never had either of those two, and she sighed and rolled her eyes as if she were feasting on ambrosia.
 Since she'd had Coke but never heard of Sprite, he assumed that Sprite hadn't been invented by 1927, but he wondered if maybe the fact that she'd never had onion rings was due to her social class.
 Times had definitely changed where food was concerned.
 You had to be extremely wealthy and travel in very exclusive circles if you'd never had onion rings or-- "Pizza!"
 she exclaimed when she saw a girl walk by with a slice.
 "I've seen the commercials on television.
 Is it really good?"
 "Fantastic.

 "Call and order?"

 "Wait.
 You need to put on shorts and a shirt over your bathing suit."
 "Oh.

 Marie had been to the shore before, but it had been years ago.
 Her father didn't think it was appropriate for a young woman of her position to be parading around half naked.
 If only he could see her now, she thought with a grin as she took off her shirt and shorts.
 There were only a handful of other people on the beach.
 Rick and Marie went for a stroll--or rather, Rick strolled while Marie ran into and out of the surf.

We were far too young to comprehend divorce so there was no reason for her to explain.
 Our dogs, Ringo and Trixie, were caged in the back of the train, surrounded by luggage.
 To get to them, it required passing through a designated men‚Äôs area‚Äîoccupied by men only.
 My mother could not accompany us.
 Smoke filled the air and men of all different types stared at Thomas and me as we huddled together passing through their compartment.
 Our mother told us not to speak or look at them and we obeyed as best we could.
 The ride was long, and I am certain that we were a handful on a train for days on end.
 We moved into a three-bedroom home with my grandparents in Los Angeles, California.
 My Uncle Dan lived there also.
 My grandfather was a very volatile person, a hateful man, and he clashed with his son‚Äîmy Uncle Dan‚Äîoften.

I managed to just give her a smile, and hold off on the tears until I'd gathered up my stuff and made it out of the room.
 Rachel caught up with me before I made it very far.
 "Adriana, are you okay?
 Don't you want a ride home?"
 I turned towards her to respond and just broke down.
 She pulled me into an open classroom and gave me a hug while I tried to explain about the two failed tests, my birthday, and how much I missed my Dad and Cindi.
 The last bit was especially garbled.
 I was pretty sure she wasn't getting any of it, but that didn't matter.
 All that mattered was I was finally able to tell someone.
 I never really got myself under control; my sobs just subsided enough for me to tell Rachel I wanted to go home.

Although this transition is often described in political and economic terms, it is far broader and deeper in its implications.
 These nations are in the midst of a simultaneous multi-dimensional transformation ‚Äì politically, from authoritarian to democratic forms of government; economically, from a centrally planned command system to free market economies; industrially, from defence-oriented to consumer-oriented production; administratively, from highly centralized to decentralized systems; structurally, from state ownership of property to multiple forms of ownership in all spheres; socially, from closed and isolated to open and internationally integrated societies; culturally, from almost exclusive emphasis on values of equity and collective security to strong emphasis on the values of freedom and individual responsibility.
 The transformation of Eastern Europe and the former USSR is of vital concern to all of us.
 Never before in human history has such massive change been carried out as an essentially peaceful revolution.
 The end of apartheid in South Africa and recent progress in the Middle East show that this process continues to have beneficial repercussions around the world.
 At the same time, this incredible advance has been accompanied by events that have destabilized the political and economic systems of the entire region, led to the break-up of the USSR, war in Bosnia, the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the COMECON trade system, a massive brain drain and the threat of huge waves of economic refugees.
 These changes, too, have had implications for all nations within the region and beyond ‚Äì severely affecting trade around the world, from the tea estates of Sri Lanka and India to the wheat fields of the United States, Australia and Argentina.
 So, too, the further course of this transition will have a profound impact on all nations, both developed and developing.
 The future of world peace, the world political system and the world economy hang in the balance.
 A successful rapid transition will open up new markets to stimulate a new round of growth for the sluggish economies of the West, much as the Mar shall Plan stimulated American prosperity in the 1950s.

They weren't towering enough.
 When you pass out on a regular basis, you get used to finding yourself on the floor surrounded by concerned-looking people, but none of these people were looming properly.
 Everyone else having somehow gotten too short suddenly wasn't as important.
 The room was still swinging around, only now it wasn't moving, I was.
 A pair of muscular arms encircled my tingling waist and legs, holding me tightly to a near rock-hard chest as Alec deftly weaved through the approaching crowd of students.
 I closed my eyes as a wave of heat started at my collarbones and rushed up to the tips of my ears.
 I wanted to throw up, except that would be even more embarrassing than being carried out of class by the most popular boy in school.
 I opened my eyes and found we were already out in the hall.
 Alec's stride was so smooth it was hard to believe we weren't still back in the classroom.
 "Put me down, I mean please put me down."

Computerization: The exciting growth of ICT-based service exports by no means exhausts the potential contribution of computers to growth of employment opportunities.
 Computerization is not merely a field or sector of commercial activity.
 The computer is an instrument and a catalyst that can stimulate creation of employment and self-employment opportunities in virtually every field ‚Äì from farming, fishing and textile designing to lean manufacturing, financial services, bio-informatics and genetic engineering.
 While the application of computers has already been extended to all these fields, there has not yet been a systematic effort to assess the employment potential that can be tapped by fully extending and accelerating this movement.
 The recent initiative in India to establish knowledge centres in every Indian village by 2007 is one example of a pioneering effort to harness ICT as a means to catalyze a whole range of on-farm and off-farm rural activities, which will inevitably translate into more and higher productivity and greater employment generation.
 These centres can be utilized to deliver technological expertise to upgrade farm yields, vocational training and education, purchasing and marketing information to raise incomes.
 The experience of India also shows that bridging the digital divide helps to bridge the gender divide in the area of knowledge and skill-intensive work.
 As the construction of rural roads acts as a stimulus to agricultural development of isolated communities by connecting them with sources of inputs and markets in the outer world, ICT can be a catalyst for stimulating the entire gamut of economic activities in rural communities throughout the developing world.
 At the other end of the spectrum, ICT is opening up unparalleled opportunities for self-employment and new business creation for the educated.
 Today more than 50 per cent of American workers utilize computers in their work.

My face started out in the hollow of his neck, drinking in the ambrosia of his scent, and then moved up towards his lips without conscious decision on my part.
 Our lips met, and it felt like a warm, pleasant surge of electricity washed from my head down to the tips of my toes.
 My head started spinning almost instantly, only my hand on his chest, and his arms around my waist kept me from losing my balance completely.
 As it was, I still fell into him, overcome by weakness as my heart stopped beating altogether.
 No more than a second or two of breathlessness could have possibly passed, but Alec pulled away, firmly holding me at arm's length.
 "You need to get some sleep.
 Regardless of how the fight turns out, you'll need to be well-rested."
 My best longing look didn't seem to be having any effect on him, so I finally nodded and relaxed back onto the bed.
 "I guess I did promise to behave myself.
 I don't think I'll be able to sleep, but if you'll tell me another story I'll at least try..." Apparently satisfied by my promise, Alec joined me on the bed and pulled me close.

His hesitation was brief, so much so I almost thought I'd imagined it.
 "Yes, Mistress Paige, I'm quite old."
 "Older than Sanctuary?"
 This time there wasn't any doubt.
 He'd definitely hesitated.
 It stretched out long enough that for a moment I didn't think he was going to answer, but then he nodded, a long deliberate motion that left no question but that it was a confirmation.
 I wanted to ask more, but didn't want to venture into the kinds of things that would get him in trouble with Alec.
 We walked for another minute or so before I was struck with the silliness of someone who was old enough to be my great grandfather calling me 'Mistress Paige.'
 "Donovan, you could just call me Adri if you want."
 "That would hardly be appropriate, mistress."

Velixar flashed an ugly smile.
 ‚ÄúThey are with me always.‚Äù
 As if this very comment brought forth their existence, thousands of decaying, mindless beings surrounded them.
 ‚ÄúHow can you command so many?‚Äù Qurrah gasped.
 ‚ÄúYou will learn.
 Come.
 We must put as much distance as we can between us and Woodhaven.‚Äù
 The hundreds from Woodhaven joined the thousands.
 Flanked in an army of undead, the necromancers trekked north.

Their faces looked like they had seen a dinosaur come back to life.
 Jason scrambled away from Emily but she nailed him so many times it didn‚Äôt matter, he was already soaking wet.
 The last of my water leaked out the back of the gun and we just stood there.
 Jason smiled but you could see he was hiding the anger in his face.
 Seth was emotionless; he didn‚Äôt give any sign on what he was feeling.
 ‚ÄúSo you felt like getting us back?‚Äù Jason asked.
 Emily glared at him, ‚ÄúYou deserved it because you soaked us too.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù he rolled his eyes, ‚Äúyou thought you could just ambush us.
 Have you learned nothing and that we might want revenge now.
 Then you will and so on.

I‚Äôm staring off across the wetlands, connecting with known drug dealers, talking to undercover narcotics officers on my personal cell phone, feeling a wire taped to my body and extending up to my neck, holding a bottle filled with one hundred Oxys in my jacket pocket.
 What brought me here?
 Where did things get so completely fucked up?
 Chapter 8: Boy Meets World I officially moved out of my parents‚Äô home when I was 15 years old, 35 years ago.
 I didn‚Äôt have a driver‚Äôs license yet, but I had a learner‚Äôs permit.
 I had no car and I walked, bummed a ride or hitchhiked if I needed to get someplace like work or high school.
 It was not easy living on my own and finding roommates at such a young age, but I managed.
 After a short stint of crashing on couches or extra bedrooms of several friends, I rented a room at a house with some other kids near my age.
 I was still in high school and I wanted to graduate, but I also needed money to live on.
 Rent, food, utilities and various expenses were all new to me.

Her name was Lisa and she was there to meet her friend who happened to be dating the bartender (who I knew well) so that was a good angle for me to work.
 I was doing pretty well getting to know her when a couple of girls I knew (and who I had hit on earlier) decided to have a little fun and disrupt my progress with this stunning lady.
 The two girls leaned in, their long dark hair flowing down and draping over each of my shoulders.
 They began whispering some very descriptive suggestions in my ears as they stroked their fingers through my hair.
 I can dual task with the best of them, but the offer I was getting in my ears conflicted with the vision across the table.
 I didn‚Äôt take my eyes off of Lisa but that wasn‚Äôt enough to keep the target of my affections seated while I was being propositioned by two beautiful brunettes.
 Lisa stood abruptly, looked rightfully angry and simply said, ‚ÄúIt looks like you are busy,‚Äù and walked away.
 I thought my chances of getting her phone number were gone forever as she gathered up her girlfriend and left.
 Well, I did have ‚Äútwo birds in the hand‚Äù and it was Valentine‚Äôs Day so I managed to do with what I had and I just needed to find a way to track my future wife down .

She hauled me off the bed, supporting me as I stood.
 She was much smaller than I had thought, slipping easily under my arm.
 I kept my head down as we walked, mostly trying not to get ill, but also unable to look Steed in the eyes.
 I watched Ruby‚Äôs heeled boots as she led me through the main room and to the door to her bedroom.
 ‚ÄúA bath?‚Äù I asked, confused.
 She laughed.
 ‚ÄúWell, yes.
 A little cold for lake bathing here.‚Äù She led me to a large basin in the corner of her room.
 Water streamed in from the window and filled it halfway.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôve laid out some clothes for you and there are some lovely soaps on the table.‚Äù She spun and glided out of the room, closing the door behind her, and all I could think was, Lovely soaps.

The minutes click.
 I just want to live through this and see my wife and children again.
 Lisa must be thinking all kinds of things, as, being wired, I cannot call her to give her an update.
 I love her so much, and I always return in my mind to the day I met her and then everything is in perspective and nothing else matters but our love.
 Chapter 12: Who‚Äôs Your Daddy Lisa and I discovered ‚Äúwe‚Äù were pregnant about four months into our marriage.
 Even though we had not planned to start a family so early, we were thrilled, excited and anxious at the thought of creating a life conceived by the two of us.
 After passing out during the movie at the birthing class, (yes, really!)
 I was not convinced I was going to be the pillar of strength my wife would need during the birth of our child (and neither was Lisa).
 I remember the movie; it was titled ‚ÄúThe Brazilian Squatting Method.‚Äù Until then, The Exorcist was the scariest movie I had ever seen, and this beat it hands down.
 I excused myself from the room‚Äîwhich was filled with couples huddled together on little mats on the ground‚Äîas I began to pass out.

That thought filled her with an astonishing sadness.
 Sadness, not just disappointment over Hollywood‚Äî-because she'd miss Rick.
 "Afraid of what?"
 Rick stroked her cheek with his thumb.
 "Hmmm?
 Oh.
 Nothing."
 Standing on tiptoe, she kissed his cheek.
 "I'll go change clothes and be right back."
 She wished she could wear her sneakers, she mused as she roamed through the garden in her bulky black shoes.

"Nothing else would be appropriate.
 Not for you, not tonight."
 As we continued forward I was able to make out the other additions to the grotto.
 The hundreds of petals had been joined by a dozen of their potted sisters.
 Their rich, heavenly scent filled the air from scores of perfect, tall buds, and I found myself leaning forward slightly in Alec's arms in an effort to capture more of its essence.
 Alec circled the pool and then stopped before a wooden easel that'd escaped my notice.
 The subtle tinkling of the tiny waterfall behind us was suddenly joined by a slight, but definitely cooling breeze that dove down into the grotto before making its way back out using the path we'd just followed in.
 It didn't seem fair for things to cool off now when it was so inconvenient after so many weeks of oppressive heat.
 I was still musing over the injustice of it all when Alec shifted me around so I was held in just one arm.
 "There's something I'd like you to have.

She was beginning to think she didn't understand her betrothed at all.
 She'd never seen him get angry before he‚Äôd proposed.
 And she'd thought that being betrothed would mean they'd spend more time together, but they were actually spending less time together.
 He had dinner with her family two or three times a week, but he and her father always retired to her father's study for the rest of the evening.
 And they'd only gone out alone twice.
 Considering the pattern of the past five weeks, Marie was thrilled when Davis told her that he was taking her out to dinner the next Friday evening.
 But it turned out to be completely unlike the night of their betrothal.
 Davis was in an abominable mood, complaining about the food, the service, even the color of the tablecloth.
 And he was too tired to go dancing after dinner.
 "Can we at least go for a walk by the river?"

Chevelle pulled me away from Steed.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take her,‚Äù Ruby offered.
 ‚ÄúNo.
 I‚Äôll do it myself.‚Äù A lot of anger.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll both go,‚Äù she pushed, forcing a polite tone.
 The rest of the group was quiet, watching us, and Ruby eyed Steed as we turned and headed toward the house.
 As soon as we were out of earshot, though I was still being dragged by the arm, I asked Chevelle, ‚ÄúDid something happen with the twins?‚Äù Ruby laughed.
 We both stared at her.
 ‚ÄúTwins,‚Äù she scoffed.
 ‚ÄúRight, well, you know what I mean,‚Äù I said, embarrassed.

Can I trust you?
 _The red eyes flared in laughter._ Can you trust anyone?
 _Qurrah crawled faster, knowing the dream was ending.
 But it couldn‚Äôt end.
 He had to know.
 He had to decide._
 Say them.
 Say them and live.
 My life for you, _Qurrah shouted as the world crystallized.
 A red line slashed across his mind, and as the dream shattered into shards the words of the dark man ripped through him._

Smoke blurred his vision, the smell of his own charring flesh filled his nose, and he dropped his sword to claw at his neck.
 Flesh burned off his fingers.
 He felt the pain fade away.
 Then nothing.
 The whip slithered off his throat and coiled around the half-orc‚Äôs hand.
 ‚ÄúSimply pitiful,‚Äù Qurrah said again, but Jeremiah did not hear it.
 His soul was already on its way.

"I think they do them twice here.
 We missed the first batch, and the second isn't until later."
 I still didn't particularly like lying, but seemed to be doing it more and more often.
 "Anyways, I was just apologizing for leaving you home alone on a weekend again.
 I ran into another trio of hikers, and they told me about a new vantage point for that crooked-looking mountain I keep telling you about.
 It's on the far side, so I'm going to hike as far in as I can while it's still light today so I can make it there tomorrow with plenty of time before sunset.
 I don't want to make the hike again, so I'll probably spend all of Sunday shooting, and then hike back on Monday."
 Mom paused in her preparations to put her hand on my forehead.
 "You're not coming down with anything, are you?
 You've been so listless lately.

In the back of every minibus, in the bathroom of every nightclub, at practice sessions, in the homes of every groupie.
 And Buddy had his groupies.
 The twins used to joke that Buddy played for scrimption and blow jobs.
 This has some truth to it‚Äîthe money wasn‚Äôt great in those days, asking for more money seen as bourgeois or worse‚Äîbut the women were wonderful.
 Buddy, though, let it be said, played for one pure reason in those halcyon days.
 He played for the rush, for the approach to the godhead.
 It was religion to Buddy.
 He sought the perfect note, the one that would bring about rapture.
 One night, after a triple billing at the Shell (Black Lung was the middle act that night, sandwiched between the lesser talents of Rubdown and Barry and the White Panthers), Buddy wandered backstage after his set, still in that trance he seemed to enter when he played, and was greeted by a statuesque blond with eyes the color of the Wolf River at Sunset.
 She stepped into his path like a gunfighter.

 She gazed up into his eyes for a moment.
 "I love you, Rick."
 "I love you too, sweetheart."
 Slowly she backed out of his arms.
 She wanted to say something else .

 but there was nothing else to say.
 Swallowing, she squeezed his hand and turned away.

 She frowned at the blond for a moment and then gasped.

 "Maybe we'll be lucky again!"

The guard was not a big man and with his celestial strength Rodregas simply picked him up and squeezed.
 Rodregas felt the guard‚Äôs neck give under his grip.
 Before the slavers could react, Rodregas went from lifting him up to driving him down into the ground.
 Adrenaline was surging and suddenly Rodregas had a bloody mess in his hand.
 The guard was very dead.
 Rodregas let go of the broken neck and stood quickly, trying to clear himself of the gore.
 Both slavers looked shocked at what had happened and Rodregas moved quickly to take advantage of their surprise.
 He went to the right and slammed his remaining sword into the Orqui.
 The slaver grunted with pain and surprise at his quick change of targets.
 Rodregas‚Äô short sword caught him in the shoulder.

"Okay, you're right.
 I didn't think you'd show."
 "I should be very hurt by your lack of faith, but seeing as how you've been through so much lately, I'll forgive you."
 My heart was suddenly trying to hammer its way out of my throat, which had constricted so tightly I couldn't seem to get any air down to my starving lungs.
 "How did you...nobody knows..." Brandon's hand was on my shoulder despite my inability to remember how it had gotten there.
 "Are you okay?
 I was just kidding, you know, about the near fight and then telling Alec off and having Britney decide she was moving on to greener pastures.
 I didn't mean anything by it."
 The attack was still trying to overwhelm me, but Brandon not knowing the full extent of my weakness robbed it of some of the momentum necessary to roll me all the way under.
 I managed some kind of reply, one that might've even been witty, but which apparently didn't manage to cover up the fact I wasn't really okay.

Harruq folded the armor as best he could and clutched it to his chest.
 ‚ÄúMy thanks, master,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúWe do not deserve what you have given us.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYou will earn your gifts in time.
 Ahrqur is a skilled swordsman.
 The armor, weapons, and strength I have granted you will make you near invincible.
 Do not fail.‚Äù
 Velixar turned his attention to Qurrah.
 ‚ÄúGive me your hand,‚Äù he said, and the thin half-orc obeyed.
 Velixar closed his eyes and whispered a few brief words.

My stomach dropped.
 ‚ÄúThere are a few things you need to remember when using a blade,‚Äù she instructed.
 ‚ÄúFirst of all, always go for the fatal attack.
 If you merely wound someone, well, someone with magic will use the last of their power to stop you.
 Cut off their head or puncture the lung and heart.
 Never mess around.‚Äù I imagined myself decapitating someone.
 I laughed as I realized my mind placed Fannie there.
 Ruby didn‚Äôt look like she could think of anything funny about what she‚Äôd said, but she continued.
 ‚ÄúSecondly, don‚Äôt cut yourself.
 These things are sharp.‚Äù She moved to toss the sword to me but reconsidered and handed it over, making sure I had a good grip.

We'd moved the beds and most of the other heavy items in earlier, which helped explain my exhaustion, but that didn't make the pile of remaining items in the back of the truck any less foreboding.
 I decided to take the easy way out, and picked up a couple of blanket-wrapped mirrors.
 I didn't unwrap either of them.
 That was dangerous too.
 The face that'd look back out of the glass would look almost more like hers than mine.
 Shoulder-length blond hair and blue eyes still seemed to be all the rage, but mine were ruined by pale skin that burned instead of tanning, and a build that had retained its baby fat long after most of the other girls had started slimming down.
 Those extra inches had evaporated recently, but of course it couldn't be a cause for celebration.
 When Mom surfaced enough to notice how much weight I'd lost, she worried I was developing an eating disorder.
 She couldn't seem to understand that I hated the new me more than she did.
 Cindi was the skinny one.

It is a question of choice.
 Evolutionary Opportunities
 What then is the justification for predicting a bright future?
 There are political, economic, social and technological forces active in the world today that can override the causality of past trends and combine together to make this a time of unprecedented opportunity.
 Intellectual synthesis: War is the result of a conflict that leads to a forceful resolution followed by a fresh period of progress.
 The end of the Second World War marked the defeat of fascism.
 It gave birth to the United Nations, followed by the dissolution of colonial empires and freedom for more than forty subject nations.
 The end of the Cold War marks the end of a seventy-year confrontation between two opposing ideologies ‚Äì capitalist and socialist ‚Äì that reflected a more profound conflict between two fundamental aspects of human existence ‚Äì individual freedom and social responsibility.
 The posing of these two as opposite and mutually exclusive forces has for long limited our freedom of thought and action and prevented us from boldly experimenting with new ways to reconcile them.
 The peaceful termination of this confrontation has lowered the mental barriers.

I dosed off.
 Then Cliff joined the rest of us.
 The parked station wagon we rammed might've saved our lives, as it kept the convertible from running up the side of a bank and flipping onto our heads.
 The station wagon was wrecked, Bob's Ford was totaled, and the four of us got cited on account of the case of beer in the trunk, which was meant for the beach party.
 Maybe in consideration of it being our prom-night, the police dropped charges on the condition that Cliff agreed to pay off the station wagon owner.
 I offered to split the pay off.
 Cliff and I postponed our move to San Francisco and went looking for work, which we found at Coffee Dan's restaurant in Grossmont Center, a mall we could see from the front yard of my mom's hilltop home.
 I was a pot washer six days a week, a split shift, 10-2 and 6-10.
 Sundays and late evenings I played with Liz.
 Before work and between shifts, I carried on where Eric had left off reading dark novels.

The distant sound of water trickling down a rock face, of leaves gently caressing each other in the breeze faded away as I took in an amazing wonderland of light.
 The trees I'd been listening to were exactly where I expected them to be, but it took me several heartbeats to recognize them.
 Gone were the sturdy, brown behemoths I'd spent so much time climbing with Cindi.
 Instead, pillars of soft light reached up to the sky, swaying slowly back and forth with the wind, creaking in a rhythm I'd known by heart since I was seven.
 I felt tears collecting in the corners of my eyes as I reached out and touched the nearest tree.
 It was as if the world I'd known my entire life had been simply a moldy cover designed to hide the true nature of my surroundings.
 Now the mask was gone and I was immersed in vivid colors, living lights, and a sense of harmony so strong it nearly overwhelmed me.
 It was impossible to say for certain how long I sat looking at the gentle motion of the tree branches, marveling at the way things made up of light could still cast shadows when silhouetted by the harsher light of the sun.
 Only somehow the sun had disappeared, replaced by the paler, colder light of the moon.
 The trees were still graceful strands of light, but the breeze had changed to a harsh thing, one carrying new scents that somehow represented danger.

Taiga‚Äôs manner continued to be friendly but inquisitive.
 The conversation started with a polite discussion on new spells that Van‚Äôdret was working on, and then moved to his thoughts on the recent political and economic tensions with the Romig Empire.
 Wine and food appeared on the table; Van‚Äôdret never saw it come, or the empty plates go.
 It simply was.
 The food, like everything in the tower, was of the finest quality.
 They were fed incredible grilled silver salmon, greens from the Northern Kingdoms, and small pastries from the Korin Islands.
 Taiga seemed in no hurry to get to any point, Immortalist had nothing, if not time.
 Finally, Taiga brought up the point that Van‚Äôdret believed had gained him the honor of joining Taiga in his solar.
 ‚ÄúSo I understand that you are to journey to the Cathedral of the Heavens for this year‚Äôs open tourney?‚Äù Taiga asked his voice as melodic as one would expect from an elf, but just a tad deeper than one would think.
 ‚ÄúYes, my lord, I leave in the morning,‚Äù Van‚Äôdret replied.

Then a girl passed along a rumor that Liz Pence wanted to go out with me.
 Liz was a beauty.
 We dated a few times before the prom, and she would've preferred that I give Karen notice and take her instead.
 But I was neither that cold-blooded nor that stuck on Liz.
 She might be as pretty, but if she possessed any goodness like what I saw in Karen, she hid it deep.
 Prom night, for reasons more complicated than I can remember so long, Cliff was driving a '49 Ford convertible that belonged to Bob Williams, whom I will visit in Portland a few days from now.
 Cliff's date was Chris Latin.
 Karen and I rode in the back seat.
 Karen had a cold.
 Maybe her reason for keeping her distance, physical and otherwise, was hygienic concern for my health.

We didn‚Äôt often have visitors, and I could count on a new spruce twig the times we‚Äôd had fresh berries.
 Might as well enjoy them.
 I popped a ripe juneberry into my mouth as Aunt Fannie rounded the corner.
 She was on her way into the room, having dashed back to her stash of wine as soon as the visitor had hit the door.
 She peered at me out of the corner of her eye, twisting the cork free of the bottle.
 Maybe it annoyed her to see I was eating her berries.
 Not that she‚Äôd picked them; I was sure she‚Äôd just set a charm on an unsuspecting squirrel to make it perform her manual labor.
 ‚ÄúCompany?‚Äù I was enjoying the bitterness of a spireberry now.
 ‚ÄúIt seems there was some trouble in town today,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúThe elders are in an uproar.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt question any further.

"They could've killed you?"
 Alec shrugged.
 "I came out okay all things considered."
 He was going to have to rethink this deflection thing, but now didn't seem like the time to get pushy.
 I forced a measure of gaiety into my voice and smiled up at him.
 "Well, I'm glad things turned out the way they did.
 Otherwise we'd both be dead."
 Alec flinched slightly, and then looked at the grotto.
 "I suppose I'd better clean this up or Donovan is going to be very unhappy with me."
 "Who's Don...." I felt my mouth drop as I finally recognized my surroundings.

It was a treat she rarely had.
 So he bought her one with the works, along with onion rings and a Sprite.
 She'd never had either of those two, and she sighed and rolled her eyes as if she were feasting on ambrosia.
 Since she'd had Coke but never heard of Sprite, he assumed that Sprite hadn't been invented by 1927, but he wondered if maybe the fact that she'd never had onion rings was due to her social class.
 Times had definitely changed where food was concerned.
 You had to be extremely wealthy and travel in very exclusive circles if you'd never had onion rings or-- "Pizza!"
 she exclaimed when she saw a girl walk by with a slice.
 "I've seen the commercials on television.
 Is it really good?"
 "Fantastic.

‚ÄúAllison All Gone‚Äù and ‚ÄúGoodbye to the Shell‚Äù especially appear to comment on Buddy‚Äôs desire to burn his bridges, leave his Memphis past behind, forget his roots.
 And, of course, then there‚Äôs ‚ÄúBurn my Bridges‚Äù and ‚ÄúForget my Roots‚Äù off the second album.
 Even Buddy‚Äôs skillful acoustic playing can‚Äôt save those albums from their own wallowing, from their stooping to the lowest common denominator.
 Of course they sold.
 They were huge.
 Buddy played with Carole King, with the L.A.
 Session, with Linda Rondstadt.
 He was revered, honored (Grammy for ‚ÄúSong for L. Enos,‚Äù 1971), patted on his self-satisfied back.
 But it was all so vacuous.
 And, what for a Memphis musician is worse, so soulless.

"If you do what you're supposed to do, garden parties and radio and reading and long walks and gossip are the extent of it.

 "I believe you mentioned last night that you fall into the second category."
 "Of course."
 She smiled.
 "Will you be my 2011 cousin?"
 He laughed.
 "Alcohol is legal now, and women can go anywhere men go."
 "Anywhere?"

Since then, I had spent many hours dreaming that she and I could run off to live in some woodland cottage.
 Maybe near a golf course, since the smashing of golf balls had become my best means of fighting the grief over losing my dad.
 Eric patted my head, which riled me.
 We finished the bourbon, then he offered to show me a wrestling hold he had recently learned.
 He was on the wrestling team, second man in the 165-pound class and challenging the first man, who was part orangutan.
 I outweighed Eric by 20 pounds, but he was stronger and faster.
 No matter in what position we started, at his pleasure and with maddening ease, he flipped me over and pinned me.
 Wondering why, after I had spilled my guts, he appeared to revel in my further humiliation, I flew into a rage, sprang to my knees, and socked him in the stomach.
 I pounced on top of him and socked him again, before he caught hold and flipped me, lashed my arm behind my back and shoved my face into the floor.
 ‚ÄúListen,‚Äù he said, without a hint of condemnation, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not really mad at me.

I walked my boys to school, helped with their homework (as much as I could) and I tried to be an important part of their lives as well as a positive influence.
 As I continued to succeed in business, our lifestyle improved.
 Throughout their childhoods, we‚Äôve had a good life and a beautiful home, nice cars, good communities, and the best of schools.
 I encouraged their interests by making sure they had the equipment they needed to pursue them.
 For instance, when Brandon showed a real interest in and talent for photography, he received his dream camera for Christmas.
 I have loved my wife and I have shown my children that I love them.
 The boys have witnessed firsthand what a healthy spousal relationship is and that was something I never saw in my childhood home.
 I always believed in teaching my children to respect all people in all walks of life.
 On the holidays I sent my boys out to give freshly baked cookies to the people who collected our garbage.
 I taught the boys how to care for our yard, mowing and edging, and they had household responsibilities and chores (and I never sprayed them with a hose nozzle, at least not to compel yard work).

 ‚ÄúNo, no you can‚Äôt.

 ‚ÄúEnough,‚Äù Qurrah said.

 The noble‚Äôs jaw dropped, and black veins appeared in his eyes.

Sixth, new educational systems must be evolved to prepare people for life in the twenty-first century.
 Education imparts knowledge of the past and the general ability to deal with the future, but this ability is only in potential.
 It is not fully developed in the form of practically useful knowledge.
 An educational system that endows the individual with the capacity for physical accomplishment, psychological fulfilment and original thinking would enable society consciously to abridge the development process and accomplish goals within one or a few decades that would otherwise take place over the span of a century or more.
 We believe that it is possible to fashion a system that directly prepares students for life in the twenty-first century, because the necessary knowledge already exists subconsciously in society and consciously in a few stray individuals or social groups.
 Materially, the world already possesses the knowledge needed to produce sufficient food and other necessities to eradicate poverty from the earth, but this knowledge is not yet a conscious possession of humanity as a whole that is passed on to every individual, even in the most advanced nations.
 Socially, every culture possesses the knowledge of the essential qualities necessary for lasting success.
 This knowledge, if consciously formulated, can be systematically imparted to the entire population through formal education.
 Psychologically, the right attitudes, values and motives enable the individual to attain a self-existent happiness and inner harmony which nothing can disturb.
 This knowledge too can be consciously formulated and communicated through the educational system of the twenty-first century.

The elf was almost past the trees when he spoke.
 ‚ÄúHey, Aurelia?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYes, Harruq?‚Äù she said, turning to face him.
 ‚ÄúHave you ever killed?‚Äù
 She paused, and then ever so slightly nodded.
 The two parted without another word.

Then he saw she was actually reading one of the Grimoires that she must have had with her.
 Her fingers were making patterns in the air.
 She was too busy to look up at Rodregas, but he almost smiled.
 He had no idea what she was trying to do, but at least they had something to try.
 He needed to keep Van‚Äôdret busy to give Imeralda time to do whatever magic she was going to cast.
 Rodregas turned to Van‚Äôdret and said, ‚ÄúWell, since you are killing us today, how about we make things interesting for both sides?
 I will answer a question of yours every time that you answer one of mine.‚Äù Van‚Äôdret expression darkened and he almost hissed his outrage, ‚ÄúYou would bargain with me, with your life held by a string?‚Äù For some strange reason that Rodregas was sure reflected a very deep character flaw, he felt his face break out in a very large toothy grin as he said, ‚ÄúAnd I have what to lose?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret stared at him for several long minutes before he shrugged and said, ‚ÄúVery well, ask me your question, but then you will answer mine or you die.‚Äù Rodregas simply nodded.
 He had no lack of questions, but was not sure which to ask first.
 He decided going small first would cause a less violent reaction.
 Rodregas said, ‚ÄúHow did you find us down here?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs expression at the question was like he had asked why is the sky blue.

We checked me out.
 We went down to the nurse‚Äôs station and said, room 1324 checking out.
 (laughs)  It‚Äôs funny now.
 But, then, it was like we were doing something extraordinary and perhaps not entirely wholesome.
 We drove home in compete silence.
 And when we got home, we undressed as if it were all scripted, as if this was the end of that chapter.
 And when we were both naked, we fell together into the bed.
 And we fucked and cried and cried and fucked and it was all ok.

Rick opened the door.
 "I saw the light on and wondered if something was wrong."
 He stepped closer.
 "You're crying!
 What's wrong?"
 "Nothing new.
 I-I'm frightened, Rick."
 He gazed down into those huge, shimmering hazel eyes and felt his heart melt.
 "It'll be all right, sweetheart."
 He sat down on the edge of the bed and drew her into his arms.

Vanquish our defensive selves, we are set free.
 One of the songs on my I-pod, "I Surrender All," has long been a favorite.
 I listen, I sing along, I pray the lyrics, I perform the song accompanied by my guitar.
 But somehow all that surrender doesn't quite work.
 Maybe I'll start praying the words of a poem by Olga Savitsky, a friend who adored God.
 She said so often, and she was honest above all, and she lived as much like Brother Lawrence as anybody I know, or know of, maybe excepting some of Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity.
 Here's Olga's poem: Father, heart-melting Father, I have tried to let go of so many things.
 Help me let go.
 If I can of my own do nothing, I can of my own self let go of nothing.
 I ask for the help of the Helper.

It is supposed to be a place of great magic and many myths and stories.‚Äù Rodregas nodded, he could not help smiling.
 He enjoyed the company of the two of them.
 It would be good to continue to travel together.
 The next day Imeralda arranged to send a group of fellow Forest Nymphs back to the farm to put a roof on the old farmhouse.
 It was probably not worth the cost of some of their excess equipment and limited gold, but the three of them all had good memories of the farm and liked the idea putting a roof back on the structure.
 The Nymphs with their connection with nature were the only humanoids unlikely to be attacked by the Dire Cats.
 The biggest surprise came when Jordaan came to say goodbye.
 Rodregas had his stuff all spread out in the room he had been using, organizing what would go where.
 The trunk had been left in the barn back at the farm, but its contents were now in his saddlebag.
 Rodregas had signaled Jordaan to wait a moment as he rolled his gear up.

She walked away, cast a levitation spell upon herself, and then settled in for sleep hovering an inch above the grass.
 ‚ÄúOdd girl,‚Äù Qurrah whispered.
 Harruq forced a laugh.
 To Qurrah‚Äôs eyes, he looked exhausted, and the shrinking of his muscles was glaring.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I left you there at Woodhaven,‚Äù Harruq said.
 ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm sorry you were alone when Velixar died.
 How did it happen?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúElves came and attacked.
 No apologies are necessary, Harruq.
 All is forgiven.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou killed many yesterday,‚Äù the man in black said.
 ‚ÄúDo you feel guilt for their deaths?‚Äù
 Harruq took a deep breath, analyzing every word before he opened his mouth.
 Velixar could surely tell if he lied.
 But what did he believe?
 Did he even know?
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not strong like Qurrah,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúSometimes I can be weak.
 Only after, though.

Ice spread from house to house, walling Velixar off on the other side.
 ‚ÄúFrom dirt to ice?‚Äù Velixar asked.
 ‚ÄúThe end is just the same!‚Äù
 The center of the wall exploded inward, but this time Aurelia was prepared.
 A rolling thunder of sound shoved all the broken shards forward, sending even the remaining chunks of the wall down the street in a chaotic assault.
 Velixar grinned.
 Clever girl.
 The wave of sound and ice slammed his body.
 He flew backward, ice tearing his skin, but no blood came forth from those wounds.
 The larger pieces smashed his body from side to side, which turned limply with each blow.

Rodregas felt more nervous the next day with the archery competition.
 While luckily the knights provided the bows for all contestants, they did not have them available for practice.
 The only bows that the three had were the Black Yews, which Rodregas continued to struggle to use.
 So while Rodregas had learned to shoot the bow when he was trained as a squire, and was proficient in it, he had not shot one in years.
 He trailed behind the others and watched them shoot.
 There were five shots that you had to make: a man shaped target at twenty paces, a crouching man shape at thirty, a standard round target in a hay bail at forty, and another round target at fifty paces and finally there was a round target dragged in hops and jumps across the field with a rope pulled by squires.
 As the first round of contestants lined up behind the rope to shoot, Rodregas watched the technique of the better archers and mentally went through Imeralda‚Äôs advice.
 She was all about breathing; she claimed that keeping your eyes where you wanted the arrow to go and releasing the string at two-thirds of the way through your exhale was the best way to hit your target.
 Rodregas became nervous as he waited.
 He was very impressed by the quality of the archery on display.

‚ÄúPlease, my friend, there is no need for subservience here; let us enjoy a meal together.
 If you don‚Äôt mind, I have a few thoughts I would like to share with you over the food.‚Äù ‚ÄúOf course, my lord,‚Äù said Van‚Äôdret as he stood up he dared to focus on the Guild Dealer for the first time.
 Taiga wore the form of a High Elf male that was slim and graceful, as was most of its kind.
 His hair and eyes were a striking pale violet color, and his skin was a light nut color which made a strong contrast with his hair.
 This was highlighted by the similarly colored silk toga he wore.
 He wore no rings or accessories, his outfit simple, but extravagant.
 Van‚Äôdret suddenly wished he had thought to dress simpler for the occasion his green and emerald outfit with its gold trim seemed garish in comparison; and his human male form that normally seemed attractive and robust seemed ungainly and drab in comparison.
 Taiga‚Äôs manner continued to be friendly but inquisitive.
 The conversation started with a polite discussion on new spells that Van‚Äôdret was working on, and then moved to his thoughts on the recent political and economic tensions with the Romig Empire.
 Wine and food appeared on the table; Van‚Äôdret never saw it come, or the empty plates go.

Nothing is of greater value to humanity‚Äôs quest for progress than an understanding of the development process and the means for consciously directing it more effectively.
 The tremendous economic achievements of Japan during the post-war period, followed during the last two decades by other East Asian economic powers and most recently by China, suggest that the time required for transition can be substantially abridged and the fruits of development achieved much sooner than has been accomplished by nations in the past.
 The rising expectations of people around the globe and the potential risks of failing to heed their call have added a greater sense of urgency to the quest for this knowledge.
 Eastern Europe
 The challenges posed by extremely rapid transition are nowhere more graphically depicted than in the current transition of the countries of Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Cold War and the break-up of the USSR.
 Although this transition is often described in political and economic terms, it is far broader and deeper in its implications.
 These nations are in the midst of a simultaneous multi-dimensional transformation ‚Äì politically, from authoritarian to democratic forms of government; economically, from a centrally planned command system to free market economies; industrially, from defence-oriented to consumer-oriented production; administratively, from highly centralized to decentralized systems; structurally, from state ownership of property to multiple forms of ownership in all spheres; socially, from closed and isolated to open and internationally integrated societies; culturally, from almost exclusive emphasis on values of equity and collective security to strong emphasis on the values of freedom and individual responsibility.
 The transformation of Eastern Europe and the former USSR is of vital concern to all of us.
 Never before in human history has such massive change been carried out as an essentially peaceful revolution.
 The end of apartheid in South Africa and recent progress in the Middle East show that this process continues to have beneficial repercussions around the world.

 Another defining moment.
 I went to stay with a friend, and I never went home again as long as Dino was alive.
 I promised myself over and over again that if I ever had children, I would never beat them.

 On the phone is lead undercover narcotics officer Denny White.
 Officer White wants to do a last minute sound check on the wire that I am wearing taped to my back.
 It seems that my lack of noise has caused the undercover officers who surround me in cars, vans and bushes to become concerned that they have lost sound.

I think I was about 6 at the time, but that hour in front of Dick Delisi and the Syncopators is as fresh in my mind as if it happened yesterday.
 Man, my dad.
 What could he have been?
 Given different times, a different circumstance.
 He said something odd to me one time, he said: ‚ÄúBud, music is a bad demon to have.
 Like hooch.
 If I could have done anything else I would have.‚Äù  And, of course, he did, I mean playing at the Vapors wasn‚Äôt bringing in enough money to support his small family, so he did books for a paint store.
 He had a business degree, was something of a math whiz, I think, and he worked in the back room of this paint store in a strip shopping center, most days.
 Sometimes my friends and I would walk up there and visit him.
 He looked sad, sitting at this shitty little desk, with a calculator and a pencil in his hand, and bad lighting.

I don't think I'll be able to sleep, but if you'll tell me another story I'll at least try..." Apparently satisfied by my promise, Alec joined me on the bed and pulled me close.
 I was still chilled enough from being outside for the warmth of his arms to feel good.
 "Adjam and Inock found that the dayborn had lost all knowledge of their loving mother, and that they reacted poorly to Inock's plague form.
 Neither brother was able to maintain their original forms for more than a few hours at a time, and although Adjam was able to blend in with the animals found in the area, there was nothing like Inock's feline body nearby, and he was chased and hunted by many of the dayborn, for they thought him a demon."
 Alec's breath caressed the back of my neck even as his quiet, velvety baritone reached inside my head and smoothed away the tensions that'd been keeping me from seeking sleep.
 I knew there'd been a reason for being so scared, but I just couldn't bring myself to care about it now.
 "The brothers watched the dayborn for many turnings, but although they learned many things, they found themselves unable to learn the dayborns' language.
 Even worse, the dayborn hunters were becoming ever more skilled at tracking Inock, and they began to press him sorely."
 I felt as though I was drifting.
 The bed no longer mattered, or even seemed to exist.

One swung his sword in a high, round arc while the other stabbed forward, hoping to gut the half-orc because of his charge.
 Harruq‚Äôs charge, though, was far from mindless.
 His speed far beyond the guard‚Äôs, he knocked the stab away, then shifted his weight so that both Salvation and Condemnation blocked the other attack.
 The weaker blade shattered against the magic of the twin swords.
 One weaponless and the other horribly positioned, the two were defenseless.
 Salvation took a throat.
 Condemnation pierced rib and lung.
 Harruq ripped his blade out of the guard‚Äôs chest and shoved the body to the side.
 The dying heap of flesh collided against two other men, knocking them back and delaying their attack.
 He mocked them, adrenaline flooding his veins.

A thought crossed my mind that was darker than the rest, that said maybe I should stay under, but the pressure to draw air stung my lungs.
 I could not drown the desire to breathe.
 I pushed through the water, gasping and cold, struggling to climb from the muck as I stood and walked out.
 I was drenched, the material of the long gown soaked and heavy and more uncomfortable than ever.
 I loosened the wet corset ties and dropped the dress into a pile at my feet, shivering as I stepped free of it and onto a rock.
 I grabbed a shirt from the pile, and then the slim pants, aware of how nice the fabric felt, how good the cut.
 A leather vest laced over the top.
 It seemed they were tailored for me.
 I‚Äôd never had such luck making my own clothes.
 These were trim and fit, made for traveling.

Accelera ting the development of poorer nations and poorer sections of the population in each country is the most powerful instrument and the surest guarantee of continued growth of jobs and incomes for everyone in the next century.
 Strategies for Developing Countries
 For the developing countries as a whole, the most critical question is how to create quickly hundreds of millions of jobs for the poor with limited purchasing power and limited capital for investment.
 The idea that most of these jobs could be created in the corporate sector or by government-sponsored activities has been put to rest.
 Currently, there are nearly one billion self-employed and unpaid family workers in the world, most of them self-employed farmers in developing countries.
 The self-employed represent 48 per cent of the workforce in low-income economies (less than $500 per capita GDP).
 For any strategy to be successful, it must give central importance to self-employment and entrepreneurship, with emphasis on agriculture, agro-industry and small firms in the informal sector.
 While a single approach will not be applicable to countries and regions of the world in different stages of development, a number of common principles and strategies are widely applicable.
 Agriculture as an engine
 Slightly more than half the world‚Äôs workforce, of whom 30 per cent are women, are still engaged in agriculture.

The rest of lunch flew by.
 I'd never realized how much fun it could be to belong to a group.
 Things weren't ideal; I'd never met a group with so many inside jokes.
 Half the time I felt like there was an entire conversation being carried on over my head, but sitting next to Brandon left me with such a tingly feeling all along my right side that I didn't really mind.
 Not even the presence of a pop quiz in History managed to faze me.
 Almost before I knew it I was sitting down in Physics.
 As usual, Alec slipped into class a half second before the bell.
 I was so happy I forgot how arrogant he was, and I smiled at him as he sat down.
 It was like he was looking at something that wasn't even human.
 My insides seemed to freeze and shrink.

 Our friend Kenny Neidermeyer's mom was a Spanish teacher who also volunteered with a Tijuana charity.
 Since June, four of us had been riding with her to Tijuana every Sunday to play a double-header for a ball team the charity sponsored.
 The Liga Municipal, Segunda Fuerza, held its games on a sandlot with a makeshift backstop and a couple of benches along each sideline, one for the players, one for the fans.
 Our teammates were mostly the older sons of squatter families whose homes, made of scraps of tin, wood, and cardboard, balanced on narrow ridges along the walls of the Ca√±on del Sol, which ran down off the mesa to the border.
 Eddie Carmichael and Kenny were swift outfielders who would later play college ball.
 Bob Simmons would one day pitch for the Minnesota Twins.

Heat rose in my neck; I could feel the corded muscle beneath his shirt.
 I had to look away.
 He must have thought I was searching for Junnie.
 ‚ÄúShe left just after dawn, when she knew you were safe.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I breathed.
 Perfect.
 We were alone in the middle of nowhere and I was sitting in his lap.
 My flush deepened and I hastily stood to straighten my clothes.
 He watched me fidget.
 ‚ÄúUm, so I guess we should get going?‚Äù I stammered.
 ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù My breath caught and I forced myself to look at him, still edgy from the closeness the moment before.

Then, no matter how valiant the efforts of healer Durien, he barely kept you two from death‚Äôs door.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo what did I do?‚Äù she asked them.
 ‚ÄúI nearly ran myself to exhaustion fetching Jordaan to heal you.
 I was using my own relationship to rescue you, who I have known less than a season.
 And now that all this effort has been done you are going to get mad‚Ä¶ mad at the only reason you two are alive to complain at all?
 Well to the Infernal with you.‚Äù  With that Imeralda turned and jumped back into the trees.
 The half Nymph‚Äôs anger, though not meant to cool the warriors, had that effect as both men stood in shock at Imeralda‚Äôs normally calm demeanor.
 Doi‚Äôvan wilted like a flower without water in the sun; he literally sat down on the ground.
 Rodregas simply sagged as the truth behind the half AElf‚Äôs words sank in.
 Jordaan simply stood watching the scene, without his normal expression of cheer.
 Finally Rodregas turned to Jordaan and said, ‚ÄúImeralda is right and I apologize for our anger.

Rick drew in a shaky breath, laying his cheek against her hair.
 That one small, hesitant kiss had been so exciting that he knew he'd be lost if she ever kissed him the way he wanted.
 And he knew himself well enough and was honest enough to admit that it wasn't just because she was beautiful and sexy.
 He was in love with her.
 Marie's pulse rate was almost back to normal, but her mind was still racing.
 "Rick," she began without looking at him, "if I told you that your kiss hurt me, what would you do?"
 He tilted her chin up to look at her anxiously.
 "Did I hurt you?
 What did--" "No, no--you didn't hurt me."
 She caressed his cheek.

"Darling, I'm sorry.
 Please come out for a minute."
 She went to open the door.
 "You hurt my feelings.
 And you hurt my arm."
 "I'm sorry.
 I'm under a lot of pressure at work, and I took it out on you."
 He took her hand and raised her arm so that he could kiss it where he'd squeezed it.
 "Better?"
 "Yes," she breathed.

‚ÄúHow will we hide the body?‚Äù asked Harruq.
 ‚ÄúWrap it in cloth and make sure you are not seen,‚Äù Velixar said.
 ‚ÄúAnd make no mistakes.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWe will not,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúHow will I know where this Ahrqur lives?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI will show you, my disciple, but first I have a gift for my dearest bone general.‚Äù
 Velixar drew out his magical chest.
 He set it beside him and let it grow out to normal size.
 From within he pulled out a suit of armor stained a deep shade of black.
 He threw it to Harruq, who managed to catch it even though his mouth hung wide open.

These resources can be applied to environmental monitoring and impact assessment, protection of endangered species, quick response to disasters and accidents, energy conservation, and the minimization and management of waste.
 The appropriate role for the military in these various activities will depend on the country, the urgency of the circumstances, and the cost-effectiveness of military involvement compared with available alternatives.
 In some instances, it may be feasible to establish international ‚ÄòEarth corps units‚Äô, specially trained and equipped to carry out certain types of environmental protection and restoration, such as India‚Äôs eco-battalions, which seek to conserve the Himalayan habitat by restoring tree cover and constructing small dams and canals.
 International development force
 The goals of peace, prosperity and fulfilment for every human being represent formidable challenges ‚Äì intellectual, attitudinal, organizational and technological.
 We cannot hope to reach such lofty achievements if we waste and squander the precious and abundant resources ‚Äì mental, psychological, social and material ‚Äì placed at our disposal.
 A massive reduction in emphasis on weapons production and military establishments, made possible by recent political events and demanded by the pressing unmet needs of people everywhere, represents both a great opportunity and a considerable challenge.
 The opportunity is not only further to reduce the threat of war by reducing the capacity for waging war, but also to redirect and utilize for other purposes the resources now dedicated to war making and prevention.
 The challenge is to do so at a time when rising unemployment and economic stagnation in many countries make further cuts in the size of the military unpopular domestically.
 Since 1990, the total number of military personnel worldwide has declined by two million or about six per cent.

I opened my mouth, still unsure what to say in response to her latest excuse, only to be interrupted by her cell phone again.
 "Yes, this is she.
 Mr. Kard?
 Oh, hello.

 I didn't realize you even had anyone working today."
 Mom listened for several more seconds and then hung up.
 "They just sent the money.

Once we had finished forsaking, we would metamorphose into lions and proceed to slay the dragon called "Thou Shalt".
 After burying the dragon, the lion would die and resurrect as a child, the infant superman, innocent and forgiving, a new beginning, a sacred Yes.
 Then, we could discover and assert our own wills, and use those wills to conquer and change the world.
 On a Sunday morning in January, a few days before my mom‚Äôs release from the hospital, a gang of us high school boys sat naked atop a giant flat boulder in a desert oasis called Palm Canyon, a few miles out of Borrego Springs and a two-mile trek past the end of a dirt road.
 We were a savage crew, six sunburnt white boys, all but one of us bald since we had shaved our heads in protest against a track coach who ordered Bill Torrey, Cliff‚Äôs younger brother, to get his shaggy hair mowed.
 We had been seven until Tom, whose last name I will keep to myself, disappeared on Friday night.
 Steve Havens had invited him along, because Tom was a lonely fellow and Steve was a churchgoing boy with an inclination toward good deeds.
 A half-hour into the trip we all, even Steve, regretted bringing Tom.
 All the way over the mountains, he had criticized us, for opening a window, calling for a pit stop, and choosing the wrong direction at a crossroads.
 In the desert he turned into a pyromaniac, pelted us with fiery sticks and blew one of our sleeping bags to shreds with cherry bombs.

I don‚Äôt mind day jobs or sharing what I earn.
 But my day job performance suffers when my mind veers off to the stories I want to get home and write, and I suspect my stories could be richer, more passionate and imaginative, more intuitive and maybe inspired, if they didn‚Äôt always get interrupted by my day job.
 Sure, Franz Kafka was an office worker and William Blake a printer, but Kafka didn‚Äôt live very long and Blake had no kids.
 Anyway, those guys were geniuses.
 Not me.
 So I worried, would the baby help squash my writer‚Äôs dreams.
 People heard I was going to be a father again and asked, "So how old will you be when the baby turns eighteen?"
 or "What if you die?"
 She‚Äôs a girl, the doctor said, and I reasoned a girl might be quieter, a little more gentle than a boy.
 Knowing her sex made her more real.

It was so foggy this morning that she could barely see three feet ahead.
 Plucking one of the magenta blossoms, she raised it to her nose as she continued her stroll and her thoughts.
 She loved being held.
 Last night was the first time he'd held her except when they were dancing and during their brief kisses.
 And she'd had to trick him into it.
 Didn't he like holding her?
 That was a silly idea‚Äîhe loved her.
 And he certainly liked kissing her.
 Marie frowned.
 Last night‚Äôs kiss hadn't been pleasant at all.

I was just numb enough still to think about such things without immediately collapsing.
 Even so, I felt a pang of dizziness as my mind warned me I'd pushed it too far today.
 I found myself in the kitchen, nearly finished making enchiladas with only vague ideas of why I'd started pulling ingredients out of the fridge.
 I wasn't hungry.
 I knew I should eat something, but that hardly merited putting together anything more complicated than a sandwich.
 What was I trying to accomplish?
 I slowly put the pan in the oven as I admitted to myself that even after more than two days, the odds were better than even that I'd be eating alone, that most of the food would go into the fridge untouched.
 My class work, neglected as it had been all day, really deserved my attention, but I didn't have the heart to pull it out.
 I knew I wouldn't find any kind of refuge there.
 Instead, I pulled out a pencil and a sheet of paper from my notebook, and started sketching.

‚ÄúThen you have no family of your own?‚Äù ‚ÄúI am not expected to pair for quite some time, if ever.
 And children?
 Ha!‚Äù He was visibly perplexed so I kept talking.
 ‚ÄúI have a family as well, though my mother died recently.‚Äù Sadness washed his features.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.
 Was it an imp?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I laughed at the strange idea.
 And for no apparent reason, I told him the truth.
 ‚ÄúShe died of sorrow.‚Äù His brow furrowed.
 We shared the boar and talked further, casually, as if we were old friends.
 He resituated himself on the rock, coming closer to me, and his shirt moved to expose a different color skin where it opened at the chest.

It explained so much about myself.
 Clumsiness, lack of skill, never quite fitting in.
 What took me by surprise was the betrayal I felt.
 All the years I‚Äôd lived in the village, I‚Äôd never counted on anyone the way I had done with this group, Chevelle especially.
 The feeling in my chest was so thick and heavy it burned.
 Struggling with my reactions kept me distracted from the ride.
 It was steep now, rocky, a haze hanging in the few spiky trees.
 When we stopped for the evening, the men quietly set up a perimeter.
 Except for Chevelle.
 He was watching me as I glared back at him.

He laughed to the others and then punched Harruq in the gut.
 As the half-orc doubled over, the guard grabbed his hair and tugged.
 ‚ÄúGot to be a disguise,‚Äù he said.
 Another guard used the hilt of his sword to strike Harruq‚Äôs back.
 The blow blasted the air out of his lungs.
 The leader of the guards tugged all along Harruq‚Äôs face, pulling hair and scratching skin.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúIt is real.

She wasn't wearing it this morning, either.
 He wondered if she realized it but decided not to ask her.
 Setting his cup down, he said, "How would you like another new experience?"

 Her face fell.
 "I could do that in 1927."
 "But have you?"
 "No."

Clear visualization of the before and after states of transition, the existing system, the goals to be sought after, and a detailed picture of the changes that need to occur in behaviour, attitudes and institutions are necessary for deriving the most effective transition strategies.
 With the knowledge the world possesses today, with the example of many successful nations over the last four decades, and with its highly educated and motivated people, surely the nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia can abridge the time required and the hardship of lessons learned by trial and error to a few years.
 But this cannot be accomplished by sweeping remedies or hastened by over-eagerness or impatience.
 It will require application of a profound understanding of the process of development and transition.
 We believe that a properly conceived effort to draw on the best available knowledge and experience of other countries can generate a transition strategy that avoids the dangers and pitfalls of the initial approach to reform and puts in place the essential foundations for the new system to function effectively and generate benefits for the people before the dawn of the new century.
 In the preceding chapters we have tried to draw attention to the uncommon opportunities that the world presents at the dawn of a new millennium for the abolition of war and the eradication of poverty.
 None will question the desirability of achieving peace, democratic freedoms and prosperity for all.
 But many may doubt the practical feasibility of accomplishing these necessary goals.
 Every great endeavour requires a proportionate investment of energy and resources for its accomplishment.
 The realization of peace and prosperity is no exception.

He was quite a ways away, and his lovely eyes were covered by a pair of sunglasses, but I somehow knew he was looking at me.
 He handed Rachel a helmet but continued to look at us, at me, while she put it on.
 I was moving again, but my pulse sped up as Rachel grabbed a hold of her brother and swung her leg over the pillion seat on the bike.
 She seemed to see us for the first time as a cold chill arced down my back and the horizon started to vibrate.
 I managed to raise my hand in response to her wave, but it was an absent motion.
 My attention was still on Alec and his unwavering stare.
 Rachel leaned forward as if to say something to him, and he finally nodded and dropped the bike into gear.
 A few seconds later the pair was screaming out of the parking lot, and my breathing was too labored for it to be anything other than a full-blown panic attack.
 I made it another couple steps, just far enough to grab Britney as I started to fall.
 I had a split second to be grateful I'd lost all of that weight so Britney wouldn't collapse under me, and then the darkness claimed me.

 BG:  	One day, it was, oh about a month after the hospital.
 I‚Äôd been at home just sitting there, you know, letting my mind rot.
 Lorelei was doing a lot of painting and she left me to myself as much as I needed it.
 But, I was doing nothing.
 I was mindless.
 I was watching soaps, for Christ‚Äôs sake.
 Hooked on soaps and dopes.
 CM:  	You weren‚Äôt still using‚Ä¶

Eugene ‚Äì Just like my father.
 My grandmother told me that he was an angry kid.
 Johnny ‚Äì Yeah, but he managed to get married.
 Eugene ‚Äì I wish he hadn‚Äôt.
 Jim ‚Äì If he hadn‚Äôt then you would have never been born.
 Eugene ‚Äì I know, it‚Äôs a paradox.
 Is it better to live, but to live through years of pain and misery?
 Or is it preferable never to have been born in the first place?
 Jim ‚Äì That‚Äôs a hard one.
 I think I‚Äôll go with having been born though.

She began covering his face with kisses.
 "I was so afraid that I wouldn't be able to get back to you.
 "How long have you been trying?"
 "Just this morning.
 Yesterday it occurred to me that if you were thinking about me the way I was thinking about you, you might open the door.
 I told my parents good-bye last night, but I really didn't know if I'd ever be able to get back.
 But here you were, thinking about me!"
 "I haven't stopped thinking about you."
 And when he'd read the pages about her and realized they hadn't changed, he'd wondered if maybe it was because she hadn‚Äôt stayed in 1927, had come back to 2011.
 Or rather, would come back to 2011.

There were no fancy speeches to start the match, a bell sounded and the next round began.
 Rodregas kept his weight low and his hands up.
 Doi‚Äôvan and he had discussed the best approach.
 Both agreed the best strategy would be to use his full strength and speed to be quick and as brutal as he could without killing.
 Doi‚Äôvan suggested body blows were best, as a full strength a punch into the face would likely kill a normal human.
 The boy who faced him was fair haired and smiling, seeming to relish the match.
 His stance was similar to Rodregas‚Äô own.
 Rodregas went slowly but steadily, keeping his guard up.
 The boy kept his hands up.
 When Rodregas went in low he took the blows to his body and went for Rodregas‚Äô face.

I looked down at leg.
 Claw marks ran up my shin and my blue blood was soaking my pants.
 ‚ÄúI had to Seth; it was heading for my house.
 That made me panic a bit.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care Jazell; if I hadn‚Äôt been here I would have found you shredded to small pieces.
 All you had to do was send me a quick text and I would have showed up to help.
 But you didn‚Äôt.‚Äù I sighed in annoyance, not in the mood for this right now.
 Seth was like this sometimes, strict and serious, but he was normally a jokester.
 He‚Äôs strict on the fact that we attack in groups, mostly for the reason that he didn‚Äôt want anything to happen to our group.
 I started to slowly limp back to my body but Seth just disappeared from my side.
 He has this annoying skill to be able to just return to his body without having to be near it, which wasn‚Äôt fair when he wasn‚Äôt the one injured.

With a sigh of resignation I found my place on the page again, and started sorting out another set of variables.
 Forty-five minutes later I'd nearly completed another two sections, and was more than ready for a breather.
 Sometime while I'd been studying, most of the kids had left.
 I hadn't expected all of them to stay until my shift started, but I'd expected more than the two or three I usually had.
 Only it didn't look like that was going to be the case.
 Apparently most of them hadn't been serious about learning the material--they'd just wanted to come to the lab, make a half-hearted attempt, and then leave secure in the knowledge that if they failed the test they could whine to their parents about how hard they'd worked.
 But Mom, I even went to the lab.
 It sort of made sense though.
 If they'd been serious about acing the test, they'd have been here every night for the last two weeks instead of trying to cram a few more morsels of knowledge into their heads at the last minute.
 Mentally shrugging at the stupidity of it all, I pulled out my Spanish and studied my vocab for a few more minutes until Mrs. Campbell came by to wish me goodbye.

There was no nearby fast food restaurant.
 "I mean, tea and cucumber sandwiches would be fine."
 At the tearoom her entrance was greeted with cries of disbelief and happiness.
 Everyone was amazed that she looked perfectly healthy and whole, and they were polite and desperately curious when she said she didn't want to talk about what had happened.
 She'd love to know what rumors were going to be flying about, but she knew none would be as fantastic as the truth.
 Several friends invited her to parties and dinners planned for the weekend, but she declined all of them, saying that she wanted to spend some time with her family.
 The truth was that she felt incapable of simply picking up where she'd left off.
 She loved being with her family again, and she was having a wonderful time with her mother, but it felt as if something were missing.
 And she knew Rick was that something.
 As glad as she was to be home, she felt incomplete without him.

The failure of the transition strategy to produce the anticipated results has given rise to extreme hardship, growing anxiety, frustration and anger within these countries.
 Internationally, it has generated intense debate about the reasons for the failure, the efficacy of ‚Äòshock therapy‚Äô, and the appropriateness and adequacy of Western assistance.
 These questions reflect an inadequate understanding, both within and outside the region, of the stages and process and essential conditions for an effective transition under the circumstances prevalent in Eastern Europe at the time.
 Understanding of this failure holds the key not only to the rapid revitalization of the former Soviet and other Eastern European republics, but also to meeting the challenges of present and future transitions in Africa, Asia and the West.
 This understanding can be summarized in the form of several lessons that can be derived from the general experience of countries in the region.
 1.Multi-dimensional transitions cannot be brought about by uni-dimensional strategies: The economic dimension of transition cannot be viewed and acted upon in isolation from its political and social dimensions.
 The reform programme was developed and guided by domestic and foreign economists who viewed the transition much like a change of clothing ‚Äì the casting off of one set of economic principles and the adoption of another ‚Äì ignoring the critical importance of social and political factors.
 This view could be summed up in the often expressed attitude, ‚ÄòGood economics makes good politics!‚Äô
 Transition is the process by which society moves from one form or level of activities to another.
 While social scientists conveniently divide social activity into several categories ‚Äì political, economic, social, educational, religious, cultural ‚Äì in practice these distinctions are at best only partially true.

I picked up the pace as Aunt Fannie‚Äôs curses came screaming through the closed door.
 She was determined not to let me forget what a burden it had been to take me in, even if it used every spare ounce of energy to do it.
 My mouth twisted, and I shifted into a run until I reached the little outcropping of rock on the west side of the village.
 I was still thinking about it when I slowed to climb through the tangle of brush in back of Junnie‚Äôs house, but once my fingers trailed the cool rock surrounding the structure, it fell away.
 When it felt as if I could breathe again, I rapped two quick knocks and then one loud knock on the small wooden door.
 It was the one sure way she‚Äôd know it was me.
 A wisp of bright blonde hair swirled around Junnie‚Äôs shining eyes as the door swung open, and I decided I must have caught her working; she looked flustered.
 Junnie was older than I, but remained striking with the blonde hair, blue eyes, and thin features that seemed to be standard-issue among the village elves.
 The Council had assigned her as my tutor, citing my advanced age as the reason I couldn‚Äôt learn with the others, but I suspected it was my stunning lack of ability that had landed me here.
 Junnie brushed a lock of hair aside.

Still, I had hoped.
 I mean being a tutor and all, it seemed like a given."
 I stuck out my tongue.
 "Please, like you really do any of those things.
 I in fact happen to know that you're in a band that performs occasionally down in Vegas, so don't go trying to pull a fast one on me."
 Albert looked genuinely startled, but recovered quickly.
 "Hey there, idle, profoundly-untrue comments dropped by Mrs. Campbell in passing conversation don't count.
 I'm absolutely not a member of Fatal Angst."
 "Yes, you are, at least you are until I either decide to dispose of your body, or let your little secret out of the bag because you're not doing your job."
 I hadn't heard Mrs. Campbell approach from behind me, and for a second worried she was really angry, but the way Albert chuckled as he cringed in mock fear alleviated my concerns.

Ravenhurr had looked for the most perfect physical specimen that he could find and Rodregas was now him.
 Over the years Ravenhurr had ‚Äúcollected‚Äù many very gifted young men.
 These men had won athletic contests and were known for their incredible physical gifts, good looks and sharp wits.
 Ravenhurr tested them for strength, reflexes and dexterity.
 Those that succeeded were further tested for the sharpness of their senses, their intelligence and ability to learn new languages.
 The winner of these tests was rewarded with having his soul and mind ripped out and made into a piece of meat to be filled with the mind, personality, and the very soul of Ravenhurr himself.
 However, this time, instead of Ravenhurr, his old guard sergeant had ended up as a new powerful Immortalist.
 As the cold of the stone chilled his back Rodregas thought about his promise to the Celestial Gods that if he were able to kill Ravenhurr and live, then his new duty would be to fight the Immortalists.
 When all and everyone else had failed him over the years, only his duty had kept Rodregas alive.
 He no longer knew what to do without it.

Ignorance and scepticism about new opportunities are characteristic of development at each stage and in every field of activity.
 Information about success stories helps overcome this resistance and spurs people to action.
 Enormous potentials are waiting to catch the attention of the society and take off at this moment.
 Proven technology exists in many fields that await application because people do not know or do not believe that it can be employed successfully.
 Imitation of intensive aquaculture methods commonly employed by farmers in Taiwan and Singapore can raise average fish yields in South Asian, African and Latin American countries 25-fold.
 Advanced methods for micro-nutrient management can double or quadruple fruit and vegetable yields in most developing countries.
 A complete list of proven but untapped technologies and commercial opportunities should be compiled for each country, each region and local area.
 Programmes should be initiated to publicize information about commercialization of agriculture, stimulating industrialization, encouraging self-employment and new business start-ups, improving management practices, etc.
 Role of the media
 Free and well-developed media are vital to democratization and development.

But, as a teenager I served as a squire of the knightly Order of the Soaring Heavens‚Äù.
 At their nod he added,‚ÄùI was never raised to knighthood, as I had neither the noble lineage nor the martial prowess.
 My life as a squire was a good life, one I appreciated more afterwards than when I was living it.
 Both the knights and the squires always started off the day with a prayer to the Celestial Gods.
 I have not done this in over forty years, but I am going to start again and I would like you to join me if you would.‚Äù The two looked at Rodregas, they were very different people, but they both seemed unsure what to say to his request.
 Finally, Doi‚Äôvan nodded at Imeralda and said to Rodregas, ‚ÄúIt has been too long since I have prayed as well, it would be good for the soul.
 Please lead us in prayer.‚Äù Imeralda did not say anything, but she nodded and followed the two of them outside.
 Rodregas knelt in the grass facing the sun, the sign of the All-Father in the celestial heavens.
 He reached out and wove his fingers together; he pulled his thumbs down and opened his woven hands in the ancient symbol of opening oneself to the gods.
 ‚ÄúDear Celestials in the heavens, we open our hearts to you and we accept our duties as your warriors here in the world.

 All throughout Woodhaven rumbled the signal to retreat.
 He gave the signal two more times before clipping the horn back to his belt and hobbling north.

Alec's smile was a bit strained at the edges, but the tenderness on his face was genuine.
 "I don't know what I'd have done without you these last few weeks."
 My heart went pitter-patter, but still mindful of the fact that throwing myself at him would just result in him freaking out and keeping me at arm's length, I managed not to go all gooey on the outside too.
 Unfortunately the effort meant I was slow responding.
 He moved on before I got anything out.
 "How's your homework coming?"
 Now I did frown at him.
 "I think my mind's going to explode if I look at my Biology book even just one more time this weekend.
 Other than that things are great."
 Alec's chuckle seemed to reach out and caress me.

It was all the convincing I needed.
 Slinking out from the branches of the spruce, I crept low along the trees and brush as I followed my watcher north.
 Chapter Six Trails
 Chevelle kept a quick pace and I found myself struggling to keep up.
 Unlike me, he wasn‚Äôt dodging between rocks and trees, bending out of sight and watching the ground to keep from breaking twigs while he tried to keep from being spotted.
 I cursed the formal dress I‚Äôd been dragging as it snagged on a low-lying thicket, flinging another string of beads into the soft dirt.
 I considered dumping it, but didn‚Äôt think it was the best idea to be sneaking around the forest unclothed.
 After crossing a few soggy patches of moss, the hem was damp and darkened.
 I might have ripped some of the excess material off, but Chevelle‚Äôs movement wasn‚Äôt leaving me time for that.
 Finally, just before nightfall, he approached a small village.

My wife‚Äôs family was similar to the 1950s TV Cleavers, and we didn‚Äôt think they would understand, so for now it remained a family secret.
 I selfishly didn‚Äôt want their advice or opinions because I didn‚Äôt expect them to ever understand.
 In their defense, they grew up in such a pure family environment that they were ill prepared for the drama that surrounded my upbringing.
 I have come to understand their view of me as a shady character, and the unlikely marriage of my kind to their perfect daughter, and I have accepted the fact that my past was a freak show compared to their lives.
 Now I had a contemporary freak-drama in my home, and didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd be much help with it.
 My family on the other hand, was pre-disastered.
 I hadn‚Äôt talked to Thomas in several years, except for a few holidays where my mother made it difficult for me not to.
 Despite getting married and having children, Thomas never settled down.
 He had been in and out of rehab for decades.
 Thomas had become very volatile and was making financial demands of us in order to see his children, our nieces and nephews, the boys‚Äô cousins.

Chevelle and the cloaked woman ran toward me and I looked up in panic.
 When my eyes fell again to my arms, they were normal.
 Had I imagined it?
 Was I losing my mind?
 My head came up once more, and the woman gasped.
 It was Junnie.
 Her cloak had fallen, her golden curls a welcome sight.
 Relief flooded me.
 ‚ÄúJunnie!‚Äù ‚ÄúFreya,‚Äù she murmured, reaching out to stroke a strand of my black hair.
 The shock of seeing her disappeared at the reminder.

 The streets were all the same to him, so down them all he wandered.
 The image of Aurelia and Harruq danced in his mind, and conflicting feelings rippled through his chest.
 ‚ÄúShe seems a kind enough elf,‚Äù Qurrah said, talking to himself since he had no company.
 ‚ÄúBeautiful as well.
 Of course Harruq would be attracted to her.
 We have elven blood in our veins, do we not?‚Äù
 The words felt hollow against the constant ache in his heart.
 Hard as he tried, he could not place it.

All that matters is that we protect this town.
 Jason‚Äôs eyes flashed.
 I stood up and leaned over to him.
 ‚ÄúWhat Jason?‚Äù ‚ÄúMonsters, a whole bunch of them.
 I saw the movement near the pond.‚Äù He pointed to the pond that was just nestled in the woods.
 And with that, we were off.
 Running towards the pond to do what we do best, destroy monsters.
 Only this time it was different.
 Chapter 2
 We ran and ducked behind a large boulder, huddling together.

Yet, during this same period total employment in America has expanded phenomenally, from a mere 13 million workers in 1870 to 68 million in 1955 and more than 136 million in 2002.
 In spite of all the automation and all the export of jobs to lower wage economies, the percentage of the American population employed has continued to rise over time.
 Several factors are responsible for this result, among which population growth and technological development are most prominent.
 Rising levels of technological sophistication certainly displace workers in most fields of manufacturing.
 But at the same time they stimulate growth of employment in many different ways ‚Äì increasing demand for the products thus manufactured by a factor of 10, 100 or even 1000 fold as in the case of automobiles, TVs, cell phones and computers; increasing the demand for research workers to support technological innovation and for teachers to meet the rising demand for education; and rising living standards, which increases consumption of other goods and services due to the falling prices made possible by rising productivity.
 Over the past two decades the US economy lost nearly 4 million manufacturing jobs but added a net 37 million jobs through expansion of the service sector, which now accounts for 84 per cent of total employment.
 It is time that we stop resisting or resenting this trend, but rather strive to adapt by shifting our focus toward those fields of employment which are most directly stimulated by technological innovation.
 Export of commercial services already accounts for 20 per cent of world trade.
 The shift from manufacturing to services is a positive and inevitable expression of the elevation of human activity from the physical to the mental level, which is the central reason for the phenomenal rise in global living standards over the past century.
 Rich nations have become rich through a shift of workers from the primary farm sector to value-added, non-farm secondary and tertiary sectors.

Chevelle held his arm out and I wondered foggily if he intended to strike one of us, which made me laugh again.
 He shook his head, plainly disapproving, and a flagon landed in his open palm.
 He knelt in front of us.
 ‚ÄúDrink.‚Äù Yes, I was thirsty.
 So thirsty.
 I took a long pull and then another.
 I couldn‚Äôt seem to quench the thirst.
 He took the container from my hand.
 ‚ÄúEnough.‚Äù My stomach roiled and I realized what I had drunk.
 ‚ÄúUgh, cat pee.‚Äù I thought I might hurl.

He took her hands, his face growing serious.
 "And I swear to you that I'll never go to Hollywood with another woman."
 She turned to reach for a tissue.
 "Please don't make me cry again."
 They went back downstairs and lay on the sofa again.
 They talked quietly until they dozed off and then awoke, talked, and fell asleep again.
 A weak light was filtering into the room when Rick opened his eyes again, his heart heavy.
 In just an hour or so, he'd lose Marie forever.
 Marie opened her eyes to find Rick gazing down at her.
 "Good morning."

A slight rustle to my right brought my head around, and I looked up to find Alec smiling at me.
 I couldn't remember for sure if he'd ever smiled at me before, but I found myself suddenly positive he hadn't.
 I would have remembered such a strangely innocent expression.
 Brandon's smile was one of the most genuine I'd ever seen, the kind of thing that only the most deceptive person could possibly pull off and not mean.
 Alec's smile was like the first bloom on a flower, something so new, so unpracticed that there wasn't any possible way it was anything other than sincere.
 It made me tingle all over, and want to giggle like I was still six.
 Several seconds passed before I realized I'd been unconsciously returning his smile.
 I felt a blush slowly rising past my throat, but I couldn't look away.
 Luckily the bell broke my strange fit of paralysis, and I was able to regain some of my composure while Mrs. Alexander struggled her way through the role.
 "I've been thinking about the fact that I didn't really give you young people a chance to ask any questions that might have come up during the course of your work on our section regarding light.

During normal periods of slow and gradual change, the impact or role of other dimensions operates below the surface and appears minimal.
 Economists studying the results of economic variables tend to overlook the influence of factors from other fields on the assumption that non-economic factors are constant.
 Under relatively stable and static conditions, these economics principles can be employed to predict changes in economic variables to a considerable extent.
 But under circumstances in which underlying economic, social and political conditions are undergoing radical change, the relevance and predictive capacity of purely economic concepts is quite limited.
 This was the situation confronting the states of the region at the beginning of the transition period, and the reason why the actual results of the reform differed so drastically from what had been anticipated.
 The situation in Eastern and Central Europe was further complicated by the disproportionately large size and importance of the defence sector in the economy.
 This necessitates, not only a change from one economic system to another, but also a restructuring of the entire economy from a defence orientation to a consumer orientation.
 This change in structure could not be brought about by reliance on macro-economic policy.
 2.Political and social consensus is essential for rapid social change: In a democratic society, the market cannot be instituted by decrees or authoritarian methods which belong to the old sys tem.
 In the new political climate, reforms will be successful only in the measure that they are understood and accepted by the population.

Several of the most powerful Knights had over the centuries, formed the officer core of The Immortal Guards.
 These Knights traded their honor for near immortality in the Guards.
 The Immortal Guards were all sigil warriors with one or several magical enhancements.
 They also had the best resources of the entire Eastern Realm, the most powerful enchanted armor, the best weapons; their officers rode Dire Beasts for steeds.
 Taking on a sigil warrior would be a huge challenge for Rodregas, or at least he thought it would be.
 He was still unclear of how strong and fast he was.
 His stomach hurt from his wound, but not as badly as it should.
 Clearly, the first step in his duty was to heal up from his wound and relearn how to fight in his new body.
 When he got up, Imeralda was already standing but Doi‚Äôvan remained kneeling in thought.
 He nodded to Imeralda and she quietly followed him back into the barn.

He was being hunted; but hunted because he had finally dealt out justice.
 He had killed two monsters, two who wore faces not their own, and who he could feel no remorse for killing.
 Rodregas had finally escaped to his quiet place in the mountains to rest and, best of all, with two companions who seemed to be good people.
 Clearly, Doi‚Äôvan had a dark side and he knew little of either of his companions.
 But it had been a long time since he had wanted to know more about anyone that he met.
 Rodregas had a new strong and powerful body, and he owed a great debt of guilt for that.
 He had even been able to free prisoners and give them a second chance at life.
 How many times had he dreamed of that while the prisoners had pleaded with him?
 He had turned a stone face to the prisoners; he had refused to learn their names, and had just survived by doing his duty.
 Rodregas pulled out the captain‚Äôs mattress, he hesitated and walked over to where Imeralda was spreading a blanket and with a smile but no words he pulled up the blanket, and unrolled the mattress and laid the blanket on top.

Most of her thoughts, concerns and energies went to her family.
 She was the mom of three wonderful kids and the wife of a loving husband.
 In horror, she returned to intense and persistent prayer, telling God he couldn‚Äôt possibly mean she should leave her family, could he?
 Rather than reply with words, he used silence, like Tae Kwon Do Master Jeong used to do when one of us students offered an excuse for not training often enough.
 For weeks she waited, listened, and prayed God would at last reply that he had only been using the method through which he tested Abraham‚Äôs willingness to obey at any cost.
 Once she declared herself ready to forsake her family, he would release her from the need to do so.
 But he didn‚Äôt release her.
 She gathered together her husband and kids, all of whom she adored and treasured.
 The kids were age 9, 12, and 15.
 She told them she needed to leave.

Brandon had been isolated so long; he just wanted to be with us, just to sit on a bench and talk.
 Before we left I told him that very few people in this world could say they were in the best place in the world they could be and that was exactly where he was.
 I told him that the irony was that the second best place in the world for him would have been prison.
 He agreed.
 As we prepared to leave we were treated with the same long embrace as when we arrived.
 As we drove off down the narrow road, Brandon waved.
 Could we really be getting our son back?
 We knew at least for now, he was exactly where he should be.
 He was far from the streets he once roamed and free from the drugs he once craved.
 Chapter 23: The Where, When & Why of Drugs We talked to Brandon as often as he could and we kept in touch with the counselors weekly.

 Mrs. Tranton gazed down at her for a moment.
 "I'm sorry, darling."
 She kissed Marie's forehead and left.
 Marie curled up next to Rick's t-shirt still clutching his handkerchief.

‚ÄúSeth seriously, stop.‚Äù You can‚Äôt command boys to do anything and to prove that, Seth shot my butt.
 Eventually they stopped, only because three water guns can hold only so much water and Emily and me looked like we could kill.
 We were both completely soaked to the bone and even though in was the middle of summer, we were shivering.
 The boys looked completely satisfied with how we looked.
 After Emily and I gave them a look, they tore down the street and disappeared.
 Emily squeezed the bottom of her shirt, ‚ÄúI hate them so much right now.‚Äù Water gushed onto the street.
 I wrung my hair out.
 ‚ÄúI agree and if we didn‚Äôt need them, I‚Äôd be planning their funeral.‚Äù Emily smiled, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be helping you.
 Do you think they would like pink coffins?‚Äù ‚ÄúTotally,‚Äù I laughed and grabbed my dry bag.

 ‚ÄúI'm defiantly not coming over anytime soon.‚Äù Emily laughed and the boys stopped walking.
 The trees parted to reveal a rock ledge.
 I spotted a small cave, the entrance covered in thick, twisted bramble.
 The sky was getting even darker and more ominous when Seth turned around to face us.
 ‚ÄúWe'll head for the cave and stay there for the night,‚Äù Seth said.
 ‚ÄúThen we'll set off.‚Äù Emily crossed her arms.
 ‚ÄúWho made you in charge?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou have a better idea, Emily?‚Äù Seth snorted.

My voice came out raw and scratchy, like I'd been talking for hours, or possibly just screaming for the last minute or so.
 I wanted to tell him about what had happened, but now that I was awake my fears felt foolish.
 I tried to distract myself by looking around, and then felt my face heat up as I realized I'd fallen asleep in Alec's room.
 "I'm so sorry, Alec.
 Donovan and Rachel told me you had copies of our textbooks in here.
 I was studying and must have fallen asleep.
 Please don't think..." I felt tears start to gather at the corner of my eyes, but there wasn't any way to tell whether they were attributable to simple terror, acute embarrassment, or a combination of the two.
 Alec's arm was back, and he gently hugged me against his chest.
 "It was all just a dream, and you don't have anything to be sorry about.
 I don't mind you being here.

Rodregas could almost smell the fire and brimstone.
 Rodregas met Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs smile with a smile of his own.
 He reached out and grabbed Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs forearm and gripped it in the handshake of warriors and said, ‚ÄúYou have spoken to me honestly.
 I will honor that with my own honesty.
 I don‚Äôt know exactly how I ended up in this body, but I do know that I killed Ravenhurr, and I killed his bastard assistant, Korin.
 The Immortalists are a sore on the world.
 Their use of others‚Äô bodies and power and their very way of life is abhorrent.‚Äù Rodregas looked Doi‚Äôvan in the eyes and said, ‚ÄúThe name I was born with is Rodregas.

 It is a duty that I know will end in my death.
 There are hundreds of Immortalists.

Liz ‚Äì Ah yeah, yes, that‚Äôs it.
 Ten Midgets didja say?
 I‚Äôm going with the angry gang of midgets wielding the pointed sticks they have the numbers and pointed sticks.
 Jim ‚Äì There doesn‚Äôt need to be a lot of dwarves, just one of them is worth like 3 midgets, pointed sticks or no pointed sticks.
 What they lack in quantity they make up in quality.
 I mean these guys are huge and muscular, at least from a midget‚Äôs perspective, and they have those pick-axes they use around the mine.
 The seven dwarves would win hands down.
 Liz ‚Äì you‚Äôre forgetting that the dwarves have just come home after a long day‚Äôs work in the mines.
 They‚Äôre exhausted, they‚Äôre not looking for a fight.
 They don‚Äôt have a prayer of taking on all 10 of the midgets.

It was 1957 and she was impregnated by her boyfriend in the back seat of his parents‚Äô car.
 My mother and father decided to sneak out to a neighboring town and get married after they discovered her pregnancy.
 After their wedding, they returned to their respective homes each night, keeping their secret.
 They did not know how or when they would break the news to their families.
 But they had overlooked a tell-tale sign of their nuptials: The event would be published under ‚Äúwedding announcements‚Äù in that little town‚Äôs newspaper, just a few miles down a rural road.
 Their secret was revealed over the high school intercom when they were both summoned from their classes to the Principal‚Äôs office.
 The announcer, heard by all who attended this rural school in the center of Hoisington, Kansas, called my father‚Äôs name, Richard T. DeHaven, and then my mother‚Äôs newly acquired married name, Karla June DeHaven.
 It echoed through the classrooms, with a collective gasp from students and teachers.
 They were excused from class, walked through the desks that lined the classroom, all eyes following them out the door.
 Their parents stood with the principal ready for their arrival at the office.

He had no desire to hurt them, and less to be killed by them; but was unsure of how they could share the farm with them.
 Like the barn, the house was made of perfect cut stone that looked almost new; everything else had gone back to nature.
 Rodregas circled around to the back where the stone steps led to the cellar.
 He was sure that originally that there had had doors covering the entrance, but of course, they were long gone.
 Rodregas smelled what he would find well before he came around the corner.
 Next to the entrance was the corpse of a large bear which had recently been killed and partly eaten.
 It had been a magnificent creature, the largest of the local black bears that he had ever seen.
 Rodregas realized that it had been a Dire beast, drawn here by the safe magical energies.
 Next to the dead bear were the two Dire Cats.
 Rodregas had gone around the corner thinking they were in the cellar, but instead found himself no more than twenty feet from them.

That was why I needed training.
 To protect myself.
 Because they intended to kill me, not capture.
 They intended to kill us all.
 And without magic, bound as I was, I didn‚Äôt stand a chance.

Kill, as I desire you to kill, and you will find a peace unknown to the mortal realm.
 The time for questioning is over.
 Trust your god as I now trust you._
 _Love me, Harruq Tun.
 Kill for me._
 The dream shattered.
 Amid the haze of red and black, he heard the cries of battle urging him on, offering him a future he had always feared and desired.
 A life of killing and battle.
 A life given to Karak.
 An orcish life.

 All those children, mothers, sisters, fathers‚Ä¶‚Äånothing but a test.
 And all those small bodies he left for his brother to mutilate?
 What was it his swords were accomplishing?
 Every action, every kill, seemed to confirm the words of his brother.
 He was a killer and nothing more.
 His legacy would be one of death and emptiness.
 The ghosts of the village clung to his back and neck.
 His choice was made.
 When he looked to the stars, he saw Aurelia‚Äôs face among them.

I can't say for sure, but they've both killed people before.
 I couldn't take the chance that they weren't just playing around.

 I thought for a moment that my knees were going to collapse on me.
 I carefully reached up and brushed the bandage on his shoulder.
 "They could've killed you?"
 Alec shrugged.
 "I came out okay all things considered."
 He was going to have to rethink this deflection thing, but now didn't seem like the time to get pushy.
 I forced a measure of gaiety into my voice and smiled up at him.

Rodregas tried to get a good hold on his shield.
 It was battered and not looking good.
 The top of its handle was loose.
 His sword was possibly worse with chips and a crack starting high up.
 As the two circled each other, Rodregas‚Äô realized that his first impression, that she was of the blood was clearly true.
 She was both quicker and stronger than a normal human.
 She was also highly skilled, and while not as physically gifted as Rodregas, she was powerful.
 She was also clearly intelligent.
 She must have been watching Rodregas in earlier matches, as she refused to let him close with her shield to shield and let him out muscle her.
 She moved quickly and fluidly, keeping her feet moving and keeping her distance.

Rachel looked down at me, her arms wrapped around her waist as if trying to hold herself together.
 "What are you doing?"
 The words stubbornly tried to avoid making sense, but I reached out with my trembling mind and forced them each into their proper place.
 "Waiting."
 The answer fell out of my mouth of its own accord.
 It took me several seconds to realize it was the truth.
 I didn't have a ride home until Britney finished up her regular studying stint.
 "For Britney?
 Do you want us to give you a ride home?"
 A slight movement, barely seen out of the corner of my eye, gave meaning to the last part of the sentence.

My class work, neglected as it had been all day, really deserved my attention, but I didn't have the heart to pull it out.
 I knew I wouldn't find any kind of refuge there.
 Instead, I pulled out a pencil and a sheet of paper from my notebook, and started sketching.
 The process slowly started pulling me back out of the numbness.
 I wasn't actually any good as an artist.
 Mom had exposed me to enough art for me to realize that early on.
 I lacked some kind of creative spark necessary to achieve any kind of real beauty.
 Still, I occasionally enjoyed trying to recreate something I'd seen.
 This time I didn't try to guide my hand, I just let it create lines and curves at random, until something tugged at my subconscious, and a half-formed memory began to materialize on the page before me.
 I knew that the wavy vertical line off the side was destined to become a waterfall.

 The tears began flowing faster down her cheeks.
 "But I don't belong here.

 A beautiful prison, yes--but still a place where I'm trapped."
 Rick stared at her, his throat thick and sore.

Mana is the raw energy of magic no matter what its source.
 You can use mana from any source to cast spells.‚Äù He looked around at the three of them to make sure they understood.
 Rodregas felt like he was back in a classroom, as he had been as a child in the Cathedral of the Knights.
 In truth all three were very interested, as magic was something that was very much affecting their lives at the moment.
 Rodregas noticed that while Imeralda‚Äôs expression was one of simple enjoyment at refining her knowledge with an expert, Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs seemed almost made of rock.
 It seemed as if he feared that if he moved, his inclusion in the discussion would be challenged.
 Jordaan, apparently satisfied with their attention, continued ‚ÄúOur ability to manipulate the sources of mana seems to be a relationship of our blood connection to a realm.
 Mortals, to a greater or lesser extent; have an ability to tap into the mana that has overflowed into our realm from the Celestial, Infernal and Elemental Realms.
 I, for one, believe that if our connections to these realms were cut,‚Äù Jordaan made a motion like knife cutting a loaf of bread, ‚Äúthat in a few years there would not be enough magic for us to use.‚Äù ‚ÄúLuckily, I can think of no way for such a thing to happen.
 But a mortal‚Äôs ability to use mana that has spilled into the mortal world is very limited.

How, given the world‚Äôs need for such people and his belief that his young wife‚Äôs gifts will make her a mother able to lavish her child with love and wisdom, could a man who, when a novice parent, helped create and develop two such excellent beings as Darcy and Cody decline to make and help raise one more.
 After the exams, written and oral, Pam got euphoric and believed she couldn‚Äôt fail at anything.
 If she wanted to be a mom, she could do it.
 And, she said on account of my kids, it appeared I had good genes.
 So we decided to get to work.
 Mighty pleasant work, which we‚Äôre both apparently competent at.
 According to the pre-natal calculations, our little girl--Zo√´ Ada Fox Kuhlken--got conceived during the week after Pam‚Äôs last exam.
 All my adult life, I have worked to support other people.
 I don‚Äôt mind day jobs or sharing what I earn.
 But my day job performance suffers when my mind veers off to the stories I want to get home and write, and I suspect my stories could be richer, more passionate and imaginative, more intuitive and maybe inspired, if they didn‚Äôt always get interrupted by my day job.

The world that is emerging is one of unprecedented opportunity to tackle the problem of unemployment that emerged with the Industrial Revolution, the massive movement of people from the land into the cities, massive migrations from one country and continent to another in search of economic opportunities, and the lightning speed of technological development that has eradicated traditional occupations while spawning whole new types and fields of human activity.
 Thus, we are faced with the paradox: an employment problem of unprecedented dimension coupled with an opportunity of unprecedented magnitude; a problem that is not going to be eliminated any time soon by the force of market mechanisms alone, but one which can be dramatically diminished by the appropriate action of governments around the world.
 Opportunities, strategies, instruments and mechanisms are not lacking, provided there is a commitment and determination of commensurate strength, a commitment that is best formulated and enshrined by a recognition of employment as a fundamental human right supported by constitutional guarantees, a commitment that must be translated into a determination by all countries to implement a broad spectrum of available strategies to address the issue today.
 Among these strategies, the greatest necessity is for every country to continuously upgrade the quality, quantity and, most importantly, relevance of educational and vocational training programs to equip its citizens with the knowledge and skills needed for productive engagement in a rapidly evolving world.
 Food Security
 The world produces more than sufficient food to amply provide for all of humanity.
 Still, more than 800 million people spread throughout the developing world lack sufficient and secure access to nutritious food and clean drinking water.
 Between 1990 and 2000, malnutrition declined from 21 per cent to 18 per cent of the population of developing countries, but it actually increased marginally among the least developed nations, particularly in Africa.
 Incidence of malnutrition among children under five years of age remains severe in both Africa and South Asia.
 But the problem is more complex than these numbers suggest.

 Harruq drew his sword.

 Aurelia watched as if in a dream.
 She felt magic spark on her fingertips.
 Under no circumstances could she watch him.
 She couldn‚Äôt.
 Nor could she believe it.
 He was so kind to her, so kind.

 Emily was pacing in the background and Jason was standing off to the side, looking very uninterested in the current situation.

 Going half a year without anyone to talk to because my mom was wrapped up with her art and everyone else in the town thought I was stuck-up would be more than I could take.
 The thought was enough to leave me speechless for the entire drive home.
 Brandon seemed content to leave me alone with my thoughts as he sped around the various turns at speeds that normally would've made me protest.
 As I went to leave the car, he grabbed me by my back pocket, which nearly made me shriek in surprise.
 "Hey, you know what you need to put all this in perspective?"
 "No, but then I think it's more than just a matter of my perspective being off."
 My fear of alienating him had almost vanished in the rush of indignation over how he'd grabbed me.
 I wanted to say something even more snarky, but there was just enough worry left to curb my tongue.

There was also the matter of the house, which was a more natural place for the three of them to shelter, but Rodregas was unsure of the Dire Cats.
 They decided to spend the rest of the morning cleaning up the barn for the horses, and then, after lunch, Rodregas would go and see if he could figure out the intentions of the lionesses.
 With the three of them working, they cleaned up the barn quickly.
 While they were able to move the dirt and debris out, it was still just bare walls and stone floors.
 After a brief meal, Rodregas headed over to the main house.
 Rodregas admitted to himself that he was nervous.
 The Dire Cats where magnificent beasts.
 He had no desire to hurt them, and less to be killed by them; but was unsure of how they could share the farm with them.
 Like the barn, the house was made of perfect cut stone that looked almost new; everything else had gone back to nature.
 Rodregas circled around to the back where the stone steps led to the cellar.

The tired, dreamy remnants of my attack were suddenly burned away as I registered the meaning of what Rachel had just said.
 Vague suspicions that people had known about Jasmin's threats vanished, driven away by the truth that Britney had been gossiping about me just the way she gossiped about everyone else.
 Rachel grabbed my arm as I tensed up.
 "I don't know what you're going to do, but maybe you shouldn't get up yet."
 I looked over at Rachel's concerned face and opened my mouth to thank her for whispering, for keeping my secret, only the words didn't come out.
 Instead the image of Alec, the one that had burned itself onto my retinas a few seconds previously just as it had done in physics when I'd looked over to see his broken pencil, flared back into life before my eyes.
 "You knew there was another time.
 Alec told you about Physics."
 Rachel opened her mouth, probably to deny it, but the look in her eyes told me it was true.
 She couldn't possibly be that scared about me putting two and two together if he'd been saying nice things about me.

Once the reason for the marriage was revealed, their parents accepted it as best as they could.
 My father‚Äôs parents arranged for them to live together in a small home while they finished school and awaited the birth of their baby.
 It was the late fifties and a pregnant teenager was an embarrassment.
 Shame followed the couple wherever they went.
 Thomas Richard was born on a cold December day to parents who were children themselves.
 I followed just 13 months later, and another brother was born 14 months later and died almost immediately after his birth.
 My mother at 20 years old had two toddlers and had to accept the death of her third baby.
 Years later, I returned to this town and located the home we first shared.
 The home, which had since been converted into a one car garage, still had the old front door located next to a single car garage door that had been put in place of what was once the front window.
 It seemed impossible that it could have ever have been anything but a garage.

"You knew there was another time.
 Alec told you about Physics."
 Rachel opened her mouth, probably to deny it, but the look in her eyes told me it was true.
 She couldn't possibly be that scared about me putting two and two together if he'd been saying nice things about me.
 He hated me, and she was scared of him, scared of what he'd do if he found out she'd let his secret slip.
 "It's not like that, Adri.
 It's..." I didn't even have to cut her off.
 She couldn't finish her own thought, couldn't come up with a lie that was believable.
 I shook my head and went back to my desk before my invulnerability wore off and she brought on another attack.
 I missed them both so badly.

 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure about the other way around.‚Äù
 Harruq shrugged.
 His mind kept replaying the fight with the orc.
 Untrained and unprepared, he had still won.
 What could he accomplish with training?
 How many might fear him if he had skill to match his strength and steel to match his anger?

"I love you too, darling.
 Where have you been?"
 Marie caught her breath.
 In her misery over leaving Rick, she hadn't gotten around to thinking up a plausible story.
 "I-I'd rather not talk about it."
 "Not talk about it?"
 Mrs. Tranton shot her husband a warning glance.
 Marie had surely been through a very traumatic experience, and they shouldn't make her talk about it until she was ready.
 "Why don't I have Louise make us some breakfast, and we can talk," Mrs. Tranton suggested.
 "If you can take your hands off our daughter long enough."

I wanted to become a writer.
 Eric fetched a pen and paper.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go to bed.
 You write a story.‚Äù Before Sylvia and Richard returned from the jazz club where Richard played, I had finished.
 It was only a few pages, about a fellow who wants peace and security, so he builds a special house with no windows.
 And he decides not to include a doorway.
 Once it‚Äôs done, he can‚Äôt get out.
 In the morning, Eric read it.
 No doubt he could have told me the theme wasn‚Äôt much different from my dream of going off with Karen to a secluded cabin, or from my quitting the baseball team so I could spend afternoons alone smashing golf balls.
 But Eric rarely gave answers to questions we could solve on our own.

"Will you put some on my back?"
 She stretched out on her stomach.
 He ran his hands up and down and around her back, massaging and caressing.
 Her skin was so soft.
 He dropped a kiss onto her shoulder.
 "Does that feel good?"
 "Mmm," she murmured sleepily.
 Moving her hair aside, he kissed the nape of her neck.
 Then he moved down, slowly pressing kisses along the length of her spine.
 Marie's toes curled, her body on fire.

If he lost, it would be much harder.
 Karun would have thirteen and he would have nine points.
 He was not sure how Geriodon or Nordien or the other leading contestants were doing.
 At the bell the two started to circle.
 Karun was a large woman.
 She was tall and unusually muscular.
 She moved with an easy cat-like grace and was attractive, in an about to kick your ass sort of way.
 She was probably of the blood and strong.
 She had her brown hair woven into a tight braid and wore well fitting chain and leather armor.
 Her sword and shield seemed to be of excellent quality.

Instead the stuck-up blonde I'd first met in the office, was squared off against a brunette less than three-quarters her size.
 As Britney pulled us even closer, almost into the dead zone between the two factions, I finally realized the smaller girl was Rachel.
 "You're going to get what's coming to you, you little slut."
 The blonde's voice sounded exactly like I'd imagined, arrogant, vindictive and only barely controlled.
 Rachel on the other hand sounded calm, speaking in tones I shouldn't have been able to hear, except the spectators were unnaturally quiet.
 "I haven't done anything to you, Cassie, and you know it.
 This is all just an excuse."
 I looked around for teachers, but they were still conspicuously absent.
 There wasn't time.
 Even if they arrived right now, someone was probably going to get hurt.

‚ÄúKilling kids is hardly worth a well done.‚Äù
 Qurrah frowned as he glanced from his prize to his brother, who sat against a tree, arms on his knees.
 ‚ÄúTake pride in all you do,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúOnly then will you improve.‚Äù
 Harruq shrugged.
 ‚ÄúYou need me?‚Äù
 The smaller half-orc opened the bag he carried.
 Inside were ashes, roots, herbs, and a sharpened knife: all Qurrah needed to work his art.
 ‚ÄúNo.
 You may go.‚Äù

‚ÄúSeth, oh when will you learn?‚Äù Seth groaned and grabbed at his sword, but Kojas kicked it away.
 Then he slashed his sword across Seth‚Äôs face.
 I saw the thin blue line well up on his cheek.
 Kojas laughed.
 ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt beat me; you can never be safe.‚Äù Seth pushed himself up and dove for his sword, which was off to the side.
 Kojas flicked his sword down and I saw Seth flinch.
 He looked at his arm in amazement where a deep cut had sliced through his clothes.
 He pressed his fingers on his arm to stop the blood and continued to scoot towards the sword.
 Kojas stepped to the side and blocked his path.
 Seth gazed up at him and I saw his eyes blaze in hate.

"Yes--no.

 She was close to tears.
 He took her shoulders and drew her into his arms.
 "What's wrong, Marie?
 Why are you so upset?"
 Her tears spilled over.
 "I don't want any other girl to walk into your garden."
 "None will.
 Honey, what happened was some kind of aberration, some-" "I shouldn't care.

He gulped the swirling blue-silver contents and then tossed the vial.
 Ripping the other arrow out of his side, he felt a warm, soothing sensation fill his body.
 ‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù he heard a raspy voice ask from atop the stairs.
 ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm fine.
 Just had to take care of something here.‚Äù
 He trudged down the stairs to where Qurrah waited.
 ‚ÄúHow many did you kill?‚Äù the necromancer asked.
 ‚ÄúJust two,‚Äù he replied.
 His skeptical brother raised an eyebrow.
 ‚ÄúThat is a lot of blood for just two.‚Äù

We went down several corridors and passed a few doors before finally coming to a large, open arena where the others waited for us.
 Chevelle smiled at me as I passed him on the way to my horse.
 I started to command the horse to kneel, but then Steed grabbed me at the waist and threw me up.
 I took one deep breath before we kicked the horses into a gallop and ran from the fort in a pack.
 Our pace finally slowed as the way became too treacherous.
 Massive rock formations loomed over us, loose stones underfoot causing the horses to stumble.
 The haze was so thick I couldn‚Äôt see anything but the riders in front of me.
 I only knew from the strain on my legs we were heading up, climbing higher into the gray sky and biting wind.
 Chevelle rode beside me through the day.
 When we stopped for the evening, he pulled me down from my horse and stayed near as we sat on large stones around a fire.

Chapter Seventeen A Fitting End
 I was surprised, in my dreams, that I wasn‚Äôt already dead.
 For a long time, there was no sound, only those disjointed images.
 When the sound came, there was something else wrong.
 It was like‚Ä¶ like I wasn‚Äôt alone.
 Someone else was there, dreaming with me, and I could see their dreams.
 They mixed with mine, creating chaos.
 There were faces I didn‚Äôt recognize and those I did.
 I dreamt of Steed, winking conspiratorially‚Ä¶ mine.
 A large and frightening dark-haired man in leather and armor‚Ä¶ not mine.

It shouldn't have mattered.
 I'd known he hated me pretty much ever since I'd met him.
 Somehow it¬†did¬†matter though.
 To have his friendship dangled out in front of me only to be yanked away a heartbeat later was somehow crueler than I'd ever guessed it would be.
 It all fit together though.
 Jasmin had told him I'd overheard her death threats, and he'd decided to use his good looks to convince me to keep quiet.
 Only he hadn't been able to keep the act up for more than just a few seconds.
 I must really repulse him.
 Physics was my own little personal hell for the next forty minutes.
 I absorbed absolutely nothing from the rest of the discussion about calculating mechanical advantage, and when we were finally released into our groups Alec and I didn't even look each other in the eyes.

Her eyes‚Äîmy eyes‚Äîwere dark.
 That muddy fog was gone now and under my black lashes waited deep emerald jewels, flecked with the darkest of browns.
 Chevelle had been right, this did suit me.
 The image in the mirror was stunning.
 It felt odd to marvel over my own reflection, but I couldn‚Äôt pretend I didn‚Äôt like it.
 The changes were still unnerving though, and I tried to remember what I looked like in my oldest memories, to see before, to see my mother‚Äôs face.
 The door opened behind me.
 ‚ÄúAh, yes,‚Äù Ruby purred as she looked me over.
 ‚ÄúLovely.‚Äù Her inflection left no doubt the word was not a compliment, only that she found it lovely she‚Äôd discovered me here.
 I could see Chevelle through the open door behind her, still in the main room and evidently annoyed.

And now I‚Äôd done it.
 Lisa jumped up screaming and crying and yelled, ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù Brandon lay face down and his blood soaked the carpet beneath his head; his hands clutched his face; he moaned and rolled over.
 Blood oozed from between his clenched fingers and ran down his chest when he sat up.
 My wife was hysterical and rightfully so.
 I stood there numb, wondering what I had done and how did my efforts to be the best father I could be turn into this?
 I‚Äôd hit him‚Äîonce.
 But I intended to never hit my child.
 I had promised myself I would never, ever repeat this offense I had endured as a child.
 I just wanted to slap him out of it, to hurt him as we were hurting, because he seemed oblivious to the magnitude of our pain.
 It all happened so fast and when I realized that Brandon was bringing these drugs into our house, while we thought we were detoxing him, it was beyond me.

Karen didn't care to join us for yet another party at Black's Beach, a place only accessible by a trail down a high sea cliff, where police never showed to bust rowdy kids for drinking.
 So around dawn, I rode shotgun while Cliff drove and Lucas Field and Carol Stuhr napped in back.
 We were on Murphy Canyon Road, a two-lane without sidewalks or curbs, bordered by vacant, hilly land.
 I dosed off.
 Then Cliff joined the rest of us.
 The parked station wagon we rammed might've saved our lives, as it kept the convertible from running up the side of a bank and flipping onto our heads.
 The station wagon was wrecked, Bob's Ford was totaled, and the four of us got cited on account of the case of beer in the trunk, which was meant for the beach party.
 Maybe in consideration of it being our prom-night, the police dropped charges on the condition that Cliff agreed to pay off the station wagon owner.
 I offered to split the pay off.
 Cliff and I postponed our move to San Francisco and went looking for work, which we found at Coffee Dan's restaurant in Grossmont Center, a mall we could see from the front yard of my mom's hilltop home.

I was still shaking on my way down the hall.
 By the time I made it into Algebra, I thought I was going to throw up.
 I felt like a complete coward, but I wasn't willing to go back there.
 I rationalized it by saying there wasn't enough time before the bell rang, but I was really just scared.
 Britney gave me a questioning glance from across the room, but I just shook my head.
 I couldn't tell anyone about what'd happened.
 Not yet at least.
 Mrs. Campbell obviously knew something was wrong, but as soon as class ended I dodged out of the room and headed towards the relative safety of the lunchroom.
 Britney's proclivity towards gossip was a complete godsend when you wanted to find out information about someone.

 Davis always had to work during his lunch hour.
 Go to a picture?
 Davis thought they were a waste of time.
 Marie climbed into bed with a frown.
 She and Davis were going to have to have a serious discussion.
 She didn't intend to have a husband whom she saw only at meals and at bedtime.

Actually, scanning wasn't the right word for it.
 I just kind of looked that way and instantly found my eyes drawn to Brandon.
 He was surrounded by people, mostly female, all attractive.
 Taking in all of those lithe, tan bodies, I suddenly felt incredibly inferior.
 All of the impending skin cancer deaths suddenly didn't seem quite so important.
 I looked away before anyone could see me staring.
 Britney was still looking longingly at a pile of fries.
 When I looked up again Brandon was looking back at me with a smile that communicated all kinds of things I'd always thought you needed words for.
 His expression seemed to say he was glad to see me, embarrassed to be the center of attention, and sorry he couldn't get away from his friends to come over and say hi.
 I felt my face go hot with embarrassment.

He cried.
 I stepped out from behind the tree and walked over to him.
 He didn‚Äôt hear me, or look up.
 I wasn‚Äôt mad at him anymore for not telling me what I wanted to know.
 Now I felt bad that I had nagged him so hard that he was breaking.
 I walked over to him and wrapped my arms around his body.
 He stopped crying and I felt him squirm.
 Seth grunted and then mumbled, ‚ÄúGet off me.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, not until you tell me what‚Äôs going on,‚Äù I said.
 He groaned.
 ‚ÄúSeriously Jazell, nothing is wrong.

Information is the most powerful catalyst for this process.
 The speed and extent of knowledge transfer are far from optimal between and within nations ‚Äì even within industrially advanced nations ‚Äì due to lack of information, out-dated attitudes and beliefs, lingering superstitions, and conventional wisdom.
 Ignorance and scepticism about new opportunities are characteristic of development at each stage and in every field of activity.
 Information about success stories helps overcome this resistance and spurs people to action.
 Enormous potentials are waiting to catch the attention of the society and take off at this moment.
 Proven technology exists in many fields that await application because people do not know or do not believe that it can be employed successfully.
 Imitation of intensive aquaculture methods commonly employed by farmers in Taiwan and Singapore can raise average fish yields in South Asian, African and Latin American countries 25-fold.
 Advanced methods for micro-nutrient management can double or quadruple fruit and vegetable yields in most developing countries.
 A complete list of proven but untapped technologies and commercial opportunities should be compiled for each country, each region and local area.
 Programmes should be initiated to publicize information about commercialization of agriculture, stimulating industrialization, encouraging self-employment and new business start-ups, improving management practices, etc.

It was amazing how quickly I could forget his supernatural abilities.
 Most of the time he seemed so normal.
 If you could consider any gorgeous, well-built boy who happened to be interested in me normal.
 Every so often though he'd do something that should be impossible.
 Alec's smile was slightly apologetic.
 "Sorry about that.
 Would you like to listen as well?"
 My confusion earned me a chuckle.
 Alec reached over to the bedside table and picked up a remote that had more buttons on it than most laptops.
 A split second later piano music flooded the room through the myriad of speakers mounted on the ceiling.

The police wanted the time to set up the area of the bust location and they did not want the drug dealer to come early and perhaps see them preparing.
 I was instructed to meet the police over an hour before the scheduled time.
 During this entire time since Brandon was busted, my wife and I had been working to detox him.
 We had him on complete lockdown at the house with no visitors allowed.
 His room and the entire house were still searched daily, including the CD cases and every nook and cranny.
 We used the professional drug tests and we tested him randomly.
 Hopefully he hadn‚Äôt found a way to get this drug into our home (again).
 He finished the worst of the drug withdrawals a couple of days after the disastrous intervention.
 When Officer White called, the bust was on.
 I hugged and kissed Brandon and Lisa as if I was about to ship off to a war.

A little.
 I just hate being such an open book to everyone."
 "Try not to let it get to you too much.
 As hard as it may be for you to believe, Alec's even better at reading people than most of us.
 There are several of the pack there at the house who are nearly as bothered by that as you are."
 The familiar feel to her touch suddenly fell into place.
 It was hard to believe that I'd spent so long with her and not realized that she was a shape shifter until she'd said as much.
 "Ah, and the first question you want to know is how come you didn't realize I was a shape shifter, isn't it?"
 I nodded, surprised at her insight, but more or less resigned to the fact that I was never going to have any kind of secret ever again.
 "Partly it's because I'm so old, but it also has a little bit to do with the fact that I've spent the last couple of decades concealing my presence from others.

As it appears I‚Äôm too attached to the world to live for and with God like Brother Lawrence did, I try to console myself by thinking of one of my favorite writers, Andre Dubus.
 In ‚ÄúA Father‚Äôs Story‚Äù, he tells about Luke, a horse breeder who attempts to live in God‚Äôs will yet finds himself needing to choose between what he believes is right in God‚Äôs eyes and his daughter‚Äôs well-being.
 He chooses for the daughter.
 I confess to finding myself more sympathetic with Luke than with the patriarch Abraham.
 Soren Kierkegaard calls Abraham the Knight of Faith, a fellow so sure of God that even the idea of questioning a command to murder his own son was unthinkable.
 Good for him.
 Honest.
 Luke the horse breeder, I can admire, and Eric I can adore, in part because I know their flaws, their humanity.
 Luke's are exposed in "A Father's Story".
 Eric's I can remember, and for reminders, I have his report cards.

And I had this erection, it was beyond human somehow, hard as anthracite‚Äîyou could hang your coat on it (laughs) and she worked her hand around me like a necromancer casting a spell.
 Just her fingers over me were like cool water.
 Jesus.

 Let‚Äôs just say, that after the preliminaries, which took hours, days maybe, she sat on me, and I entered her, and she was hot like sulfur, like a volcano.
 Tophet.
 Her cunt was hot, and I fell so deeply into her that I haven‚Äôt come out yet.
 Can you dig that?
 I haven‚Äôt come out yet.
 In a way, we are still in that first fuck, that first joining.

I would have remembered such a strangely innocent expression.
 Brandon's smile was one of the most genuine I'd ever seen, the kind of thing that only the most deceptive person could possibly pull off and not mean.
 Alec's smile was like the first bloom on a flower, something so new, so unpracticed that there wasn't any possible way it was anything other than sincere.
 It made me tingle all over, and want to giggle like I was still six.
 Several seconds passed before I realized I'd been unconsciously returning his smile.
 I felt a blush slowly rising past my throat, but I couldn't look away.
 Luckily the bell broke my strange fit of paralysis, and I was able to regain some of my composure while Mrs. Alexander struggled her way through the role.
 "I've been thinking about the fact that I didn't really give you young people a chance to ask any questions that might have come up during the course of your work on our section regarding light.
 Now's your chance, please ask away.
 If I don't know the answer, I'm sure that together we can find an adequate explanation for whatever you might have come across."

"Still a little sore.
 I should have put some lotion on this morning."
 "Go do it now."
 "I'm feeling too lazy."
 "Tell me where it is, and I'll get it for you."
 Following his instructions, she went to his bathroom and got the lotion.
 Opening the bottle, she sniffed it as she descended the stairs.
 It didn't smell as good as the sunscreen, so she wasn't tempted to rub any onto her own skin.
 "Thanks, honey--this'll feel great."
 He rubbed some on his legs and then stripped off his shirt.

They had control over me.
 My thoughts shifted, running through it again, going backwards from where I was.
 Their faces, the chanting from behind me, Chevelle backing away, the dream.
 The water.
 I remembered being trapped underwater just before waking, but I hadn‚Äôt been drowning.
 It wasn‚Äôt a dream.
 I was horrified as more of the memory returned.
 The cloaks who had surrounded my mother, killed her, had been circling me.
 I knew they‚Äôd intended to destroy me, too, though I couldn‚Äôt see why.
 Chevelle had held me, pulled me into the water.

The father of my girlfriend Lori was an executive of a supermarket chain, and he made some calls and got me an interview.
 The manager explained to me that he would love to hire me but he had a hiring freeze on everyone but minorities.
 I had no idea what this meant so I asked, and he explained to me all the types of minorities that he could hire, including, American Indian.
 I said, ‚ÄúHey, my grandfather was half American Indian,‚Äù and he hired me on the spot.
 I have never used my heritage in any way since that day.
 It felt wrong to me that because of my ancestry I could be hired, but I needed a job and this one paid well.
 I worked the 3:00 pm to midnight shift bagging groceries and stocking shelves.
 The money was good and it helped me provide for myself.
 I purchased a 1967 Chevelle SS for $1,000 and I spent a lot of time and money trying to make it faster than the next.
 Hot Rods were as popular in the 70‚Äôs as I remembered them in the days of Bob‚Äôs Big Boy Drive Ins.

My mind writhed with anguish through the night.
 As I emerged from the shelter late the next morning, I was resigned.
 I would continue my journey with him and let him return me to the council without resistance.
 It was all I could do.
 I found him sitting near the shelter‚Äôs entrance, distress apparent in his features.
 ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I said, indicating the shelter.
 He nodded, but his face didn‚Äôt quite return to the serene mask he usually wore.
 My stomach knotted; I hadn‚Äôt eaten since our ride the day before.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get you some food,‚Äù he said.

Everything was silent.
 He listened but heard no signs of approaching guards.
 They had probably heard something but none would question the master, or at least the person they thought was the master.
 He pulled his way in through the shattered remainder of the door; in the middle of the room was a large round table with several books and papers spread out on it.
 Next to the open windows was a very nice desk with a very comfortable looking chair; next to the fireplace were several larger overstuffed and even more comfortable looking chairs.
 There were not as many books as Rodregas had thought there would be; only one wall was covered in shelves and miscellaneous piles of scrolls and other items.
 Next to the desk there was a fancy set of shelves with glass covers to protect them.
 He went over to the glass enclosed shelves; the books looked richly made but old.
 Books of sorcery would sell very well indeed.
 The glass covers were locked, so again he muffled the sound with the blanket and forced the cabinet doors open.

He would have liked to have known her.
 Well, before her marriage, anyway.
 He‚Äôd bet that she‚Äôd been a lot less complicated than the women he knew.
 And she was so beautiful.
 Rick went to bed without having decided anything about an outfit for the dance.
 But for some reason, the young woman from the 1920s was still very much on his mind.

I'd just managed to drop off into a fitful sleep when she came back home and ruined any chance of me catching up on the sleep I'd missed because of the trip.
 I'd never been able to go back to sleep after being woken up in the morning, but I tried anyways.
 By the time I finally gave up and got out of bed I was not a happy camper.
 I was even less so by the time Mom finally woke up.
 Rachel not having been at Les Mis√©rables had been preying on my mind the whole time I'd been studying, and since Brandon wouldn't work for girl talk, I needed to hash it all out with my mom.
 Only she was so far gone, getting anything out of her was all but impossible.
 She interrupted partway through my description of what'd happened to ask if I'd noticed when the light outside my bedroom had stopped working.
 As if I cared when some stupid bulb burned out.
 I tried for another fifteen minutes, but once her mind started focusing on a new project, anything less than the domestic version of a tactical nuke had effectively zero chance of catching her attention.
 Apparently someone decided that having my mom completely ignore me in my moment of need was going a little too far on the divine retribution.

And then she was over it.
 ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs eat.
 I‚Äôm famished.‚Äù She fired a look back at me, her hair flipping in the process.
 ‚ÄúHmm.
 I‚Äôm not supposed to take you outside.
 Not supposed to leave you.‚Äù I stood, waiting.
 ‚ÄúFood,‚Äù she decided.
 She yanked two cloaks from the corner and tied them on, covering our heads, and led me to the wardrobe by her bed.
 I couldn‚Äôt imagine how we could get any more clothes on as she opened the door and started to throw them onto her bed.
 But she leaned out of the wardrobe door to whisper, ‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù She stepped into the cabinet, dragging me with her.

 He sat up straight and shook his head, trying to clear the fuzz that clogged the vast empty space between his ears.
 Qurrah helped by offering a third kick, this one right to the kidney.
 Harruq gasped and staggered to his feet.
 He was outside their little home in seconds, urinating on the grass.
 ‚ÄúHadn‚Äôt pissed yet,‚Äù Harruq shouted to his brother.
 ‚ÄúYou could be a bit kinder, you know.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúAt least you‚Äôre awake,‚Äù Qurrah said back.

I know that you're engaged, and I know--" "But that's it.
 That's what I'm talking about.
 I can't marry Davis."
 His eyes widened, and he seized her in his arms.
 "Oh, sweetheart, that's fantastic!"
 He took her face in his hands and rained kisses on her mouth.
 "I couldn't bear to lose you."
 He threaded his fingers into her hair, nuzzling her temple.
 "L-lose me?"
 she breathed.

Due to his status as a senior sergeant, he knew where the key was kept.
 Once the door was open, he stepped inside.
 Immediately, his eyes went to a long side bench where several new pieces of armor were piled up.
 These would be some of the more recent pieces not yet sorted or sold off for not being of use to the guard.
 Captain Poir had a tendency to leave some of the better equipment there for long periods, just in case they might prove useful at a later date.
 Most of the armor was average civilian crap, but he quickly found several large pieces of leather scale armor that were his size.
 From the good fit he surmised that it had been the property of the original owner of his new body.
 The armor was braided leather with steel scales attached; he quickly tried it on and found it to be a perfect fit.
 It was probably custom made and was solid, if unspectacular, quality armor.
 The braided, lacquered leather reinforced with the steel scales provided decent protection for most fights.

 God I was just kidding.
 Look I‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to offend.
 Now can we get on with the name?
 Liz ‚Äì If you want something big and bad and scary, why don‚Äôt you go with a famous name, that no human has ever used, like Polythemus, or Kraken or even Grendal.
 Eugene ‚Äì Hey, that‚Äôs a good idea, I would never have thought of using a name of a mythological monster.
 Thanks Liz.
 Jim ‚Äì Most of those names aren‚Äôt well known, and the people who do know them would die of laughter rather than of fear.
 Liz ‚Äì Use a modern monster name then, like King Kong or Dracula or something.

She laughed.
 "What happens if these things break?"
 "I call someone to fix them."
 "Oh--so there is somebody who knows how they work."
 "Yeah."
 He grinned.
 "Just not me.‚Äù He turned up the sound on the TV and flipped to the western.
 Marie watched as a beautiful woman listened to a man's heart and then went home to dinner with her family and then kissed her husband when they were alone.
 It was all so real!
 It looked as if they lived in a small western town and were a real family.

 Harruq arrived at the sparring point in the forest less disheveled than the previous day, and he seemed in better spirits.
 ‚ÄúSo what is your surprise for me?‚Äù he asked.
 Aurelia smiled from her seat against a tree.
 She patted the grass beside her.
 ‚ÄúHave a seat.
 How‚Äôs your head?‚Äù
 Harruq grumbled as he plopped down.
 ‚ÄúMy head is fine.‚Äù
 From behind her back, Aurelia pulled out a small blue object.

She suspected that Davis had something special planned for that evening, and when she caught her mother's glance over their teacups, she knew right away that her mother shared her suspicions.
 He took her to a French restaurant in the Back Bay, not far from her house.
 "Is your veal good?"
 he asked her after sampling his own.
 "Delicious.
 And yours?"
 "Fine."
 He seemed preoccupied, so she just concentrated on enjoying her food, the candlelight, and the music.
 The restaurant was a perfect choice.
 She just hoped he was taking her dancing after dinner.

The latter have proliferated in recent decades and affected almost half of OECD imports during the 1980s.
 By the end of 1990, there were more than 200 export-constraint arrangements involving product groups of impor tance to developing countries.
 The incidence of anti-dumping cases against developing countries rose substantially in the late 1980s.
 The more recent effort by the industrial nations to impose 'fair labour standards' on exports from developing countries could well become another form of constraint, unless carefully formulated to focus on the basic rights of workers, rather than on arbitrary minimum wage levels.
 Efforts to accelerate the dismantling of both trade and non-trade barriers should be viewed as a central element of a global strategy to stimulate employment generation.
 6.Debt repayments: The debt problem is a major obstacle to the development and welfare of at least 60 heavily indebted, developing countries, including two-thirds of the world's poorest nations.
 Most of these countries suffered a decline in per capita income over the past decade and are now in arrears with more than 20 per cent of their debt obligations.
 The debt burden discourages new foreign investment and lending to these coun tries and prevents them from stimulating economic growth through additional domestic savings and investment.
 International debt relief has helped ten, mostly middle-income, debtor countries significantly reduce their commercial debt.
 Past actions to relieve the debt burden on low-income countries have been relatively small in relation to the amount of debt, which has continued to rise under the combined impact of accumulated interest arrears on old loans, falling export commodity prices, and new compensatory loans, frequently given on expensive terms.

I didn‚Äôt share her enthusiasm, so I retired to my room and read more of the journal.
 There were many sad passages after the passing of the writer‚Äôs mother, though their bond didn‚Äôt seem traditional.
 It seemed more‚Ä¶ formal.
 And there were many complaints about the additional workload, both with the castle duties‚Äîwhich were described in more detail‚Äîand her training.
 I couldn‚Äôt be sure how much time had passed without the entries being dated, but her mood had definitely shifted.
 Father has been merciless in my practice and testing with Rune.
 Unrelenting sessions are wearing on me.
 I can barely concentrate.
 I don‚Äôt have the energy for the simplest tasks, let alone the new and wild trials he‚Äôs created.
 He thinks he has to test every possible idea he has or else he won‚Äôt know what I might be capable of.

‚ÄúThey are stubborn and will defend their homes until death.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúIt is more than that,‚Äù Velixar said.
 ‚ÄúThe Quellan elves have already been pushed across the rivers by the Mordan people.
 Both races of elves fear for their existence.
 Celestia has grown distant to her clerics.
 Mankind breeds like mice while the elves find themselves gradually dwindling.
 A man fighting an elf is like a grain of sand blowing against a stone, yet strong winds and fields of sand can reduce the sturdiest of boulders to dust.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWhat are we to do?‚Äù Qurrah asked.
 Velixar looked at him and smiled.
 ‚ÄúKill the messenger and the guards that accompany him.

Chapter 12
 The monsters surged up the hill, blocking out Kojas‚Äô delirious laughter.
 Seth shouted, ‚ÄúStay together, don‚Äôt get separated!‚Äù A troll charged at me and I jumped to the side.
 I looked up and saw that Emily, Jason, and Seth had been swallowed by the rushing creatures.
 So much for that plan.
 ‚ÄúEmily!‚Äù I yelled but my voice was drowned out.
 I saw a flash of fire off to the side.
 Emily was fine.
 I twisted around so that the troll charged past me.
 I turned and plunged my knife into its back before it could respond and it fell to the ground.

What if you kissed me so hard that-that my teeth cut my lips?
 What if--" "I would never, ever hurt you."
 He caressed her hair.
 "If I ever do anything that hurts you or that you don't like, tell me, and I'll stop.
 Right away.
 I care about you, Marie, and I'd rather never kiss you again than hurt you."
 She laid her head on his shoulder again.
 She believed him.

She can't really miss him.
 Not like I miss him."
 For a second I thought he was going to argue with her.
 His tired smile had the feel of resignation, of something that'd been well argued over the years.
 "Will you play something for us, Mother?
 Adriana hasn't had the pleasure of listening to your songs."
 I'd rarely seen anyone change moods so quickly.
 "No.
 You know it isn't ready.
 I'll tell you when I've perfected it.

She'd love to know what rumors were going to be flying about, but she knew none would be as fantastic as the truth.
 Several friends invited her to parties and dinners planned for the weekend, but she declined all of them, saying that she wanted to spend some time with her family.
 The truth was that she felt incapable of simply picking up where she'd left off.
 She loved being with her family again, and she was having a wonderful time with her mother, but it felt as if something were missing.
 And she knew Rick was that something.
 As glad as she was to be home, she felt incomplete without him.
 It was as if her whole morning had been a series of peaks and valleys.
 She and her mother would exclaim over a dress that was perfect for her, and then she'd realize that she wouldn't be able to wear it for Rick.
 She'd see an elegant necktie that would be perfect for Rick and then realize she could never give it to him.
 She'd known she'd miss him, but she'd thought that the excitement of being home would lessen that feeling.

She was an older horse, in her early twenties, and was known for her mild manor.
 She was saddled and ready to go, evidently she was Korin‚Äôs planned mount.
 Rodregas took a deep breath and calmly walked out of the keep and over to the stables.
 It was not large, ordinarily holding only about a dozen horses.
 He looked around to find that it was emptied out, except for the two carriage horses.
 They must have been left in case Ravenhurr wished to travel, which would be unlikely with all his guards and servants scattered over the town, but good servants did not take their master‚Äôs transport from him.
 In the open central area, he saw both the small carriage and the supply wagon that Ravenhurr used for traveling and carry supplies back and forth to the keep.
 He looked at it and smiled.
 With the carriage horses and wagon he could strip a lot of useful items out of the keep.
 He went next door to the smith‚Äôs and started gathering up tools, and loading them up into the smith‚Äôs travel trunk.
