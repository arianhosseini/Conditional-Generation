The two thousand obeyed, scattering in a constantly moving jumble of arms and legs.
 “That should help keep our presence hidden for a time,” Qurrah said.
 “They are but distractions.
 The darkness will hide us from their arrows.”
 Before Qurrah could ask what Velixar meant, his master was already in the midst of another spell.
 Inky darkness rose all about his feet, swirling like black floodwaters.
 Chills crept up his ankles as the liquid darkness grew.
 Velixar cried out the final words of the spell, spreading the darkness for a mile in all directions, so high it covered up to their necks.
 “It is cold,” Qurrah said, his teeth chattering.
 “You will not be harmed by it,” Velixar said, watching the approaching army.

The resulting blow had an unpleasant sound and cut right through Doi’van’s sword.
 Unfortunately for the guard, Doi’van stepped forward as he swung and jammed the lower half of the sword into his opponent’s chest.
 The guard flew into the bushes with a sickening crunching sound.
 Rodregas next heard the sound of another of the enemy and spun into the sound using all his speed and strength, hoping to take a guard with either advantage.
 His target proved to be a slaver.
 He had a ragged beard and held a small battle axe.
 Rodregas’ sword blow was too fast for the guard to block and had the strength to stun a guard wearing regulation armor.
 His sword cleaved the guard in half, and a gout of blood and gore splattered him.
 Rodregas pulled his sword free and spun away from the mess.
 As he came to rest the sound of arrows was quiet, part of his mind knew that Imeralda was backing deeper into the forest.

He has no car so he walks about one mile back on the shoulder of the narrow country road in Werner Springs as he talks to us.
 You can hear the crunching sound of the road’s gravel beneath his feet and imagine the gait of his walk from the delay between the sounds.
 The need for material objects is no longer what he desires and either are the drugs he once craved.
 We are touched by his compassion, his love and his maturity.
 We look forward to his call nightly and when we hear sirens, we feel sorrow for the parents whose visions are what ours once were.
 Our entire family welcomes our son back and we all realize that no matter how helpless a situation like drug addiction seems we now know that there is help, professional help.
 Most importantly, there is hope where there is love and there is love where there is family.
 Within any family and throughout the generations there will be many moments that define you as a person.
 If you are a father or a mother now, there was a day when you were a son or a daughter.
 Perhaps one day you will become a grandparent.

In earlier ages, people revolted when their most basic needs were not met, when they were denied rights or oppressed.
 Today, vast sections in developing countries are stirred to action because their expectations are not fulfilled.
 Economic liberalization has unleashed people’s expectations: witness the rush of Chinese peasants to invest in the stock market and the increasing demand of Indian villagers for a range of consumer goods.
 The same movement continues in the West as increased physical and social mobility, the growing demand for higher education and the widespread urge for greater recreation and travel.
 These expectations are the seed and driving force for social progress.
 They provide the energy and create the openness and willingness for change.
 But they also increase the danger of frustration, disappointment and violence.
 The end of the Cold War was expected to usher in an age of peace, but actually violence is on the rise in both developing and developed countries because of the widening gap between human expectations and achievements.
 This growing gap between expectations and achievements is at the root of contemporary turbulence worldwide.
 The popular and some times violent demand for freedom and participatory democracy, the return of religion in politics, surging ethno-nationalism and intolerance, and rising urban crime are disparate expressions of this phenomenon.

“If you had been mine at the age of nine…‌ my previous apprentice Xelrak held but a shred of your strength.”
 Qurrah straightened at the name.
 “I have heard of Xelrak.
 He toppled the Citadel.”
 Velixar smiled as he remembered a cherished memory.
 “Indeed.
 It was his finest hour, and a significant victory for Karak.
 The paladins of Ashhur are all but crushed.”
 “What happened to him?”
 His burning eyes held no kindness when the man in black spoke.

Jeremiah Stoutmire walked through the village of Cornrows, the hair on his neck erect.
 The cool spring breeze was weak compared to the ice that locked his spine.
 He held a torch in one hand and a shortsword in the other.
 At first, he had thought himself foolish waking in a full panic from a nightmare he could not remember.
 Then he saw others about, lit torches in their hands, and he knew his fear was justified.
 A young, fat-nosed farmer saw him awake and approached.
 “Couldn’t sleep either, Jeremiah?” he asked.
 “Aye, had the worst nightmares.” Jeremiah glanced at the sword in the farmer’s hand.
 “You feel the same, don’t you?”
 The farmer nodded.

The painting revealed beneath was in fluid motion, an artwork of death and fire.
 He saw a city burning, people fleeing in the streets, and then he saw himself dressed in black armor that oozed power.
 Salvation and Condemnation waved high above his head, both drenched in blood.
 He looked like a god among men, and the way the soldiers fell at his feet made him think he might have been one.
 This red-dream self looked straight at him and spoke, but Harruq could not understand the words.
 The sound of his own voice chilled him, though, for it was dark, it was dangerous, and it was exactly like Velixar’s.
 _A god among men,_ said a second voice, one he had never heard before.
 It was darker than any shade that haunted his nightmares.
 There was only one it could be, and it was no mortal.
 _Protect your brother, and I will grant you a kingdom.

 Johnny – I just meant that, I’d rather be hit by a speeding train than to talk to the king of idiots again.
 Liz – Why didn’t you just say that in more simple terms in the first place?
 No need to lead us on.
 We got all excited about knowing our future, and here you go and do that.

What more could she do?
 Well, one thing she wasn’t going to do was give up, she determined as she played with the hem of her dress.
 She’d strolled through her garden countless times without walking into 2011, so who knew how many times she’d have to walk in the garden to get back to 1927?
 She wasn’t going to give up.
 Rick, still concerned about Marie, left work at 4:30, making a quick stop to pick up a surprise for her.
 To his dismay, he found her huddled in a corner of the sofa, still wearing her 1927 clothes.
 “Hi, sweetheart,” he greeted her, going to sit beside her.
 “Are you feeling better?” “I’m all right.” “I brought you something.”  He handed her a plastic bag.
 She took it and reached inside.
 “Wow!” she exclaimed as she withdrew the 16-ounce Hershey bar.

Several factors are responsible for this result, among which population growth and technological development are most prominent.
 Rising levels of technological sophistication certainly displace workers in most fields of manufacturing.
 But at the same time they stimulate growth of employment in many different ways – increasing demand for the products thus manufactured by a factor of 10, 100 or even 1000 fold as in the case of automobiles, TVs, cell phones and computers; increasing the demand for research workers to support technological innovation and for teachers to meet the rising demand for education; and rising living standards, which increases consumption of other goods and services due to the falling prices made possible by rising productivity.
 Over the past two decades the US economy lost nearly 4 million manufacturing jobs but added a net 37 million jobs through expansion of the service sector, which now accounts for 84 per cent of total employment.
 It is time that we stop resisting or resenting this trend, but rather strive to adapt by shifting our focus toward those fields of employment which are most directly stimulated by technological innovation.
 Export of commercial services already accounts for 20 per cent of world trade.
 The shift from manufacturing to services is a positive and inevitable expression of the elevation of human activity from the physical to the mental level, which is the central reason for the phenomenal rise in global living standards over the past century.
 Rich nations have become rich through a shift of workers from the primary farm sector to value-added, non-farm secondary and tertiary sectors.
 Poverty and hunger persist so long as a majority of the population depend upon the routine operations of farming for their livelihood.
 This is also the cause of the growing feminization of poverty in developing countries.

He glanced back to the shed, cursing his idiocy for not retrieving his weapons while he had the chance.
 “The coin,” demanded a guard to their right.
 “Hand it over.”
 “No,” Harruq said.
 The leader rammed his fist into the half-orc’s face.
 Harruq staggered but held his ground.
 Blood ran down his face, and he spat some away from his mouth.
 He waited for another punch, but nothing came.
 The man was staring in total disbelief at the weapon he held.
 As he had stepped closer to punch, the gem at the end had shimmered a soft green.

And she should have asked Rick to set an alarm for her so that she could have walked in the garden this morning.
 She shouldn't skip any mornings; she never knew which day might be the one when she'd find herself back in 1927.
 When she went downstairs, Rick was watching television.
 "Want to watch `Bonanza'?"
 he asked.
 "OK." He glanced at her, bemused, when she sat down on the far end of the sofa.
 "You can come closer.
 I don't bite."
 "I'm not worried about being bitten."
 "So you're worried I'll try to kiss you again?"

Steed shot me a mischievous wink.
 “Well?” I was speechless, mouth agape.
 The thing seemed as large and black as a starless night.
 Steed was pleased with my reaction, but Chevelle’s eyes rolled heavenward.
 He didn’t comment, though, simply holding out a hand to help me mount before swinging onto his own.
 “I will ride with you as far north as Naraguah and then make my way east to trade with the imps at Bray,” Steed told Chevelle.
 I swung a shocked look at my watcher, who simply nodded.
 Steed saw my confusion and gave a disapproving glance in Chevelle’s direction.
 He sat straighter, leaving me alone with Chevelle as rider and horse shot past us, a long black tail whipping in their wake.
 I stared at Chevelle.

After knocking the brush away from my shelter, I slung the pack over my shoulder and trudged north once more.
 There was an abundance of streams running through the hills, and a few patches of fat, amethyst berries along the way, so I couldn’t complain.
 And the route was undemanding; the ground was smooth, nothing too overgrown to make passage difficult, none of those nasty snarls that could form from a maze of thorn trees or the network of vines that could tangle your legs.
 The grass was tall, but soft, so it rolled over, hiding no more than the occasional field mouse or vole.
 Sporadic wildflowers dotted the hills, small sprays of pinks or spiky yellowbird.
 The sky was cloudless and blue, the sun a constant companion as I carried on through the days and hills.
 Each new day was something unexpected, and the trip became less daunting than it might have otherwise been.
 I was moving every moment of light, and so exhaustion pulled me into sleep every moment of darkness.
 I concentrated on each step, breathing in the new scents, counting trees, anything I could to keep myself on task and the past out of mind.
 I was counting fallen catclaw seeds when I crested another hill and spotted a bridge in the valley.

“I am going to choose lion, but it would be great to have a pride, or maybe the Moon Wolf or the Mountain Bear.” Doi’van nodded and walked over to the bear.
 It was a kind of bear that Rodregas had not heard of in the mortal world, even larger than ‘his’ lion.
 The bear actually had a thick tail and its teeth seemed far larger than any bear he had heard of.
 Doi’van stood there looking up at the great beast for a long moment.
 Then he cocked his head; his nose went up as if he smelled something.
 He stepped around the great bear and headed toward the back wall.
 The score of statues, while separated, were clustered in the middle of the great room.
 The four walls of the room seemed to be set back with the ceiling gently coming down in the form of great arches.
 In one of the great arches was the door they had entered.
 The stone around the door was the gray of the local granite.

“Why do you flee?” Harruq roared when her crying eyes glanced back at him.
 “This life is pain, suffering!
 I’m here to end it, end it all!”
 The woman ran faster and her child cried louder.
 It didn’t matter.
 Harruq rammed her with his shoulder.
 To protect her child, the woman rolled so that her side took the brunt of the fall.
 As the half-orc’s blades twirled in the air, the mother kissed her child one last time before curling up around the joy of her life.
 Then the blades fell.
 On the half-orc ran.

Her folks either enjoyed our company or preferred to have their daughter at home even if she brought the whole gang with her.
 Their family room had a pool table and a stereo.
 While most of us played eight-ball or listened to Sunday’s dad, Ivan, an engineer, explain how things worked, Eric listened to the Messiah.
 I knew he loved Christmas, which was near.
 Besides, I had given up surprise at anything he might do.
 So I hardly noted the changes in his obsessions and moods, until Christmas day.
 It was the second anniversary of losing my dad.
 After the family party at my Aunt Evangeline’s place, where my dad had eaten his final meal, I drove to pick up Eric.
 He wanted to go to Sunset Cliffs, near Fort Rosecrans where his dad was buried.
 His dad, Carl Curtis, was an Army Air Force pilot who crashed during a test flight while Eric was still a baby.

 "Rick," Marie finally began, "maybe I should wait another day."

 "It won't be any easier tomorrow.
 And I can't promise I'll be able to stop myself if we start-start kissing again."
 He was right.
 And she didn't think she'd stop him even knowing that they would end up making love.
 Half an hour later Marie sat up.

“Excuse me.
 I didn’t mean to interrupt.” She seemed pleased she had.
 Chevelle’s hand dropped and I could see out of the corner of my eye his face was hard.
 Ruby continued, “Steed said you had a guest so I just used the back…” She trailed off when his stare didn’t soften, but she smiled.
 “You know, you do have your own room.” He stiffened and stood, not at all amused by her implication.
 Ruby began gathering things as she spoke, pretending she hadn’t noticed his attitude.
 “So how did it go?” He relaxed a little but his mood didn’t rise in the least.
 “We shall see.” “Indeed,” she purred.
 “Indeed.” He didn’t look back at me as he left the room, simply directing Ruby to take me with her when she’d finished.
 She seemed more than happy to comply and I was in no doubt we would be training again.

I'd just finished identifying the raging beast to the right as James, when Brandon stepped into the light.
 He looked like some kind of pagan god, smeared all over with blood, an uneven circle drawn on his chest, filled with sharp, angry lines that didn't mean anything to me, but which made the wolves around me tense and growl.
 "While I appreciate the sentiment, it really is far too late to secure absolution by bringing me the girl."
 His voice had changed, becoming deeper and harsher, with elements that didn't sound like they could come from any human throat.
 He stepped forward, and I felt my chest seize up.
 The transformation I'd sensed the beginnings of at the dance had run its course now and any question as to why someone as cultured as Brandon would associate with a near-psychopath like Vincent was put to rest.
 He was shaking now, quivering with the need to kill, and I realized that it didn't matter whether the darkness inside Brandon had created Vincent or just attracted him to orbit in his sphere like a small moon.
 It was enough to know that Vincent's was the lesser evil.
 "Adri is here solely as a witness."
 Alec's voice was huskier than normal, but still carried most of its velvety perfection.

I started towards the back seat, only to feel Rachel's surprisingly-firm grasp guide me towards the front seat.
 She got me settled and then slipped in behind me.
 James pulled out of the parking lot with a rush of acceleration that pinned me to my seat.
 Normally I'd have gripped the door hard enough to make my fingers creak, but I was still strangely unconcerned with the possibility of dying.
 For the first time in months I simply slouched down in my seat and enjoyed the ride.
 The little Accord zipped around corners faster than I would've believed possible, its tiny engine howling as the turbos wound up in between shifts.
 My bemused state was interrupted by Rachel leaning forward and tapping me on the shoulder as she gestured for James to turn his music down.
 "I almost forgot.

It’s his voice alright, but there’s an anger there, a tension, that surprised me.
 Buddy Gardner, when I knew him was a sweet, soft-spoken man, a man driven by ambition, sure, but, underneath that, there was a humility and a human heart .
 It’s all here in these tapes, so enough said.
 Three weeks after these interviews were concluded, Buddy Gardner was found dead in his home, with a needle in his arm.
 Lorelei had disappeared.
 These tapes somehow also disappeared until 1999, when they were found in a stockroom in an abandoned studio in Los Angeles by a technician there who, with some heaven-sent Extra Sensitive Perception, sent them to Camel Jeremy Eros, c/o City Lights Bookstore, where for a while I was taking my mail, while recovering from a broken relationship, one that emasculated me, silenced me, did me up a treat.
 These tapes were a godsend—they took me out of myself, out of the self-pity I was wallowing in.
 Many thanks to John Wender, editor extraordinaire, who recognized what we had here and ran them in his celebrated periodical.
 Hence, they ran first, almost in the form represented here, in three installments in Big City Magazine.

"We'll buy you some."
 She'd been so depressed the day after their conversation about lovemaking that he'd told her they'd go shopping tonight and to the beach tomorrow--and even Sunday, if the sunscreen worked.
 She went to him, looping her arms about his neck.
 "Thank you," she said, raising her lips to his.
 She seemed to have recovered, Rick mused as he watched her try on white sandals half an hour later.
 He never would have believed he could enjoy shopping, but he loved watching her discover new styles and new toys.
 He'd bought her a pocket calculator on the way to the shoe store.
 They were going to Teri's for dinner the next evening, and Marie showered and put on her new white dress and sandals when they got back from the shore.
 "How do I look?"
 she asked Rick when she joined him downstairs.

Now we have to figure out what it means.” Emily walked up to the edge of the hole and looked down.
 “I have a feeling that we have to go down there.” Jason sighed.
 “I guess we’re jumping down.” “Why would we do that?” “Because,” he said and sat on the side, “we don’t have a rope.” Then he jumped.
 *** Life is good when you don’t have to worry about anything and everything is calm and peaceful.
 Well that’s not my life.
 My life isn’t peaceful by any standards.
 It involves lots of smart remarks and bad decisions involving life or death.
 It also involves a bad choice of a place where you roll around pretending like your life could be normal for a second.
 Yeah… Seth sat up quickly and looked around.
 He must have heard it too.

One after another the deft strokes came in, and one after another Antonil batted them away using the methodical style that had helped him rise to his place at the top of the Neldaren army.
 His opponent, a young elf whose swordplay was raw compared to most of his brethren, tried to give him no reprieve.
 The guard captain didn’t falter in the slightest.
 “You sacrifice planning and thought for sheer speed and reflexes,” he said, his breathing steady and practiced.
 He assumed the elf spoke the human tongue, and the sudden killing lunge proved him correct.
 Antonil pulled his head back, the point stopping just shy of drawing blood.
 An upward cut took the blade from the elf’s hand.
 Antonil’s sword looped around, thrust forward, and buried deep inside flesh.
 The elf fell, gasping for air from the fatal wound.
 Blood pooled below him.

This whole thing with Jasmin is really crazy; we've got to figure out how best to handle it.
 Maybe it really said all of those things, or maybe I was completely deluded, but it was definitely a smile.
 That alone was enough to make my heart skip a beat, and send a warm tingly feeling lapping through me like a wave of distilled happiness.
 I was halfway through History before I realized there'd been something odd about the discussion at Brandon's table.
 Luckily, Mr. Simms started out the class in usual form.
 It was virtually guaranteed we wouldn't learn anything which was fortunate or I might have missed something.
 Once my mind latched on the question of what had been different than normal, I didn't hear a word anyone else said.
 It wasn't until I was back at my locker and midway between switching out my History book for my Physics notes that I finally realized what it was.
 Normal juniors didn't sit at a lunch table and figure out what to do about anything.
 They complained, they gossiped, they boasted about what they were going to do, but it was all just an exercise designed to reinforce the social order.

All that time, all those killings, and this was how he would fail.
 “Karak!” he shouted, all his power fleeing him.
 His undead minions collapsed, their souls released.
 The gates to the abyss opened before his eyes, and he felt the pull on his soul.
 The dark fire already burned.
 He saw the face of his master, and the sick grin there horrified him.
 “I will not die!” he shrieked.
 “I will not die!”
 His flesh burned in fire, his bones blew away as dust on the wind, and only an empty robe remained of the being that was Velixar.
 Yet, still haunting the wind, was his final cry, a promise to the world of Dezrel.

 “They would kill me because of the pendant, the library?” “No, Frey.
 You have broken some of your bonds.
 They will not risk trying to bind you again.” I struggled with an intake of breath.
 He stood and started toward me, about to speak again—just as the door swung open.
 Chevelle’s face flushed with anger.
 “Elfreda!” Steed was through the door and to me in three long strides.
 He grabbed me at the waist, picking me up and spinning me so that my cloak swirled behind.
 The shock and exuberance of his greeting was too much and I couldn’t help but let out a breathless laugh.
 He put me down but kept me close, his hands still at my waist.

“It is a tan… from the sun.” He pulled the laces and lifted his shirt over his head, throwing it aside to show me his bare chest.
 The bronzed color of his face extended there, but was a lighter shade.
 I examined him closer, taking his hand and turning his arm.
 The inside of his wrist was lighter still, close to the shade of my own skin.
 I was still studying him when he spoke softly.
 “May I kiss you?” His breath hit my face; I hadn’t realized how close I had gotten.
 It surprised me, as did his request.
 I had a perverted desire to let him.
 I smiled thinking of it.
 He took that as an invitation, leaning closer, his hand raised to touch my face.

I don't understand any of this junk, so you can explain it to me now and then we won't have to spend as much time in that stupid tutoring lab."
 The old me would have told Britney she was a self-centered wench, but the new me, the one that was all too aware of how much it would suck to go through the next two years of school without a single friend, just forced my face into something approximating a smile and tried to explain why drawing something at random from a bag with replacement was different than drawing something from a bag without replacement.
 It was a fairly straightforward concept that we'd seen twice now.
 I was pretty sure Britney was capable of understanding, she just didn't care, which was the one thing virtually guaranteed to make me mad.
 Stupidity was bad enough; laziness would be a hundred times worse.
 Still, by the second time through I'd clarified a couple of points I'd been a little fuzzy on, and was almost ready to believe Britney might actually apply herself to listening.
 I was so caught up in what I was doing, and the ever-so-slowly growing light of interest in Britney's eyes, that the rest of the class had fallen silent for a full twenty seconds before the drop in noise registered for me.
 "I want everyone back to their regular desks and hard at work on their assignments."
 Mrs. Campbell wasn't as pale as she'd been when she'd left, but she still looked unsettled and more than a little unhappy, presumably with both whatever had caused her to leave so quickly, and the fact that she'd come back to a class where almost nobody had been doing anything productive.
 I had a couple of heartbeats to hope she'd realized I'd been trying to help Britney with her homework, and therefore not deserving of any punishment.

All I want is to be with you, and if we're as likely to all die as you seem to think we are, then the state of my mind after you're gone is hardly something worth wasting worry on.
 I accept your invitation.
 As much as I hate the very thought of going to any formal dance, I can think of nothing better than going with you."
 "That's the addiction, the Ja'tell bond talking."
 Now that I knew his concerns, it was hard not to notice just how distracting the feel of his lips under my fingers was.
 Just how pleasant it was to have his hand cupped over mine.
 It was with an incredible amount of regret that I let go of him, and put several inches of empty air between us.
 It didn't help much; I could still feel his energy caressing the exposed pieces of my skin.
 "There, I'm not touching you, and I still want to go to the dance with you.
 Want it more than anything else."

He looked down at Aurelia with a mixture of anger and embarrassment.
 “Sorry,” he said.
 Blood ran from a busted lip.
 The skin on his cheek was already blackening.
 “I don’t know what just happened,” she said, the quiver in her voice belying her calm speech.
 “But I know I don’t like it and will not accept it.
 Ever.
 Is that clear?”
 “Yeah,” Harruq said.

This place feels very good.
 The last few years the only time I was in a place rich in magic, I was also a prisoner.
 It is good not to hunger for magic and be FREE!” Rodregas was, of course, curious about the Hellborn’s background but had been hesitant to ask.
 You do not want to piss off one of the Hellborn.
 Hellborn were not necessarily chaotic and sadistic beings, like actual daemons or Greater Daemons, at least unless they voluntarily chose to become one of Hell’s Chosen.
 Rodregas did not think even one of the Immortalists would choose to mess with one of Hell’s Chosen.
 Hellborn on the mortal world were welcome among the Orqui much like those of Celestial blood were among the humans and the AElves.
 The Orqui mated with Daemons and their offspring became its races noble house, just as the blood of Celestials flowed in the noble houses of Humans and AElves.
 Of course, here in the Eastern Realms true ruler ship was not by the demi-gods of the noble houses anymore but by the Immortalists and their Guild of the Celestial Path.
 Often those of Celestial blood, instead of being rulers, were prey to the Guild for their rituals.

The elf grabbed the shaft of the arrow, and that sick anger filled his face.
 “How many of my kin died to your hand?” he asked.
 A twist of his hand sent spasms of pain all throughout Qurrah’s body.
 He coughed violently, and blood ran down his lips and neck.
 “Don’t feel like answering?” the elf mocked.
 “Why did you kill them?
 For money?
 Power?
 How many died to better your miserable excuse of a life?”

If he did make that apparently loco remark, I would bet he was trying to express the beauty to which communion with God can lead us.
 Like today, when I find myself delivered far beyond the ordinary, into a realm where the glory of simple hills and pastures, of cows and bluebirds, is such that I know why the prophets described heaven as jeweled and paved in gold.
 Father Zossima in The Brothers Karamazov relates this kind of beauty.
 Before his conversion, in the aftermath of a duel, “’Gentlemen,’ I cried suddenly, speaking straight from my heart, ‘look around you at the gifts of God, the clear sky, the pure air, the tender grass, the birds; nature is beautiful and sinless, and we, only we, are sinful and foolish, and we don’t understand that life is heaven, for we have only to understand that and it will at once be fulfilled in all its beauty, and we shall embrace each other and weep.’”
 Darkness
 For the first time in weeks, a deep sadness grips me.
 Where is it coming from, I wonder?
 After a while, I give up wondering and pray for an answer.
 When no answer arrives, I decide to track my thoughts backward, which leads me to the source, which was a recognition that I had lived much of my life in the aftermath of a grievous mistake.
 If I hadn't been so stubborn, if I had trusted God from the time I first believed, I might've spent all these years in a richer world, maybe not living every moment in the kingdom of heaven, but residing close enough so I could visit more regularly.

It’s quite a tangled web.
 Steve had been busted some time ago and released when he agreed to work with the narcotics division of the police department.
 Steve’s bust was kept a secret so he could fold back into the drug world unnoticed and collect information on drug dealers like my son and share that information with the officers so they could set up these dealers.
 Steve was tasked with introducing undercover officers into the inner circle that would eventually lead to a bust that appeared to be far removed from the original contact with Steve.
 The only problem with Steve is that he was double-crossing the narcotics officers and they had come to discover his deception.
 Steve and his girlfriend, Ashley were highly addicted to Oxy and their combined drug habit made it necessary for him to continue to deal Oxy to the bigger buyers while tossing a few small fish to the officers to appease them and satisfy his deal.
 The officers knew too that Steve was beating his girlfriend and forcing her to perform “happy ending massages” and sexual favors to support her personal addiction to Oxy.
 Brandon was one of the small fish that Steve provided information on.
 Brandon had become so addicted that he could no longer supply the drug in quantity because he and Tiffanie consumed over $1000 a day by snorting or smoking it.
 Brandon had gone from a large dealer to a junkie who would do anything, say anything and sell anything to get his next fix.

 I ran into her at lunch downtown, and I invited her out for drinks that evening.
 She's good, Rick.
 It was the first time I'd been alone with her--you know, without you and my own date--and it took her less than ten minutes to figure out that I'm not exactly the marrying type.
 I still don't know how I gave myself away.

 At least that’s the advice that you’ve given to me for the last ten years.
 Art – I mean I haven’t been on a date in over twenty years.
 I don’t have a clue what I should wear on a first date.
 Jim – Why don’t you just go in the same kind of thing you’re wearing now?
 Art – Won’t she think that I’m a slob?
 Jim – Why are you asking me that?
 I don’t know her, and to be honest women confuse the hell out of me.
 All I know is that the only way to appease them is to offer sacrifices of flowers.
 Art – The flower trick is important, but it doesn’t always work.

Britney seemed to be getting suspicious that I wasn't really listening, so I had to make a lot of eye contact over the next few minutes.
 When I finally got a chance to look back up, Alec and his friends weren't at their table.
 Cassie caught my eye before I looked down, but she was definitely glaring.
 Not the typical I-hate-you-and-I'm-going-to-do-everything-I-can-to-smear-your-reputation-and-get-you-in-trouble-because-we're-in-high-school-and-that's-all-I can-really-do type glaring.
 Instead her eyes seemed to warn me never to go out alone at night because if she ever found me somewhere without any witnesses, they were going to have to hospitalize me.
 I felt a chill run through me, and dropped my eyes out of involuntary reflex.
 I probably would've started shaking if someone hadn't grabbed my shoulder and startled some kind of twisted cross between a shriek and a gasp out of me.
 I turned to give whoever it was a piece of my mind, but Brandon's laughing gray eyes made the words tangle up before they made it down to my tongue.

One big event was when our son received a call from another friend of his while we were away on a family vacation.
 The friend told Brandon that his best friend, Tom, had been in a horrible car accident and was near death.
 Our son, like Tom, just sixteen years old, was hysterical, and we returned home immediately.
 It seemed like half of the high school was holding a vigil at the hospital when we arrived.
 Tom was paralyzed from the waist down in the accident.
 Car washes were held as fundraisers for this handsome and popular young man whose family had no health insurance.
 Tom was always such a bright spot and had an infectious personality.
 As time went on Brandon never stopped being his best friend.
 At sixteen years old Brandon was helping his young friend with everything from carrying him into a car or up the stairs to helping him on the toilet or into a bath.
 They would race down our hallway in the wheelchair laughing and carrying on like nothing was amiss.

It worked.
 He threw his hands up, covering his face, screaming.
 But he did not attack me.
 As I rose back to find my next target, I saw the wolves.
 They were also not being attacked, fighting with no opposition.
 And then I remembered what Chevelle had said.
 They would not kill the animals.
 As I laughed, the hawk screeched, and Chevelle and Steed glanced up at the sound.
 They were fighting, almost back to back, the bodies of councilmen strewn around them.

Davis had never rearranged his schedule for her.
 Rick spent every moment of every evening with her.
 He'd even refused to play racquetball tomorrow with a friend who called last night because he wanted to spend both Saturday and Sunday with her.
 Marie blinked back tears of confusion.
 She was betrothed to Davis.
 But it was getting harder and harder to remember why she'd fallen in love with him.
 He didn't spend much time with her, didn't hold her very often, didn't do anything really fun.
 And he wasn't nearly as handsome as Rick.
 Rick had beautiful blue eyes and-and a broad, muscular chest that she got to see every morning if she woke up before he did.
 In her dreams, he never had on a shirt, and he was always smiling.

After that we wandered around and talked to a couple of ghosts.
 We did a lot of running away from scary noises.
 Especially after I tried hitting that one ghost over the head with a fire poker, it didn’t care for my intent.
 Finally we just met back up with Gene and Johnny.
 Liz – Did they find anything cool?
 Jim – Yes, they were playing video games on this enormous television in the living room.
 Art finally sees Liz and approaches her.
 Liz – Jim, you need to seek help.
 Jim – Probably, but I won’t.
 Art – Excuse me Liz, but have you seen Jim about here?

Time slowed down for me as he hit the railing and started over it.
 His feet came up and his torso was hanging in the void when someone reached over and grabbed his arm.
 I heard a grunt of effort, saw him stop moving, and only then realized it was Ben who'd nearly died.
 In the split second between Ben being gently placed back on the stairs, and everyone starting to breathe again, I followed the arm that'd saved him back to see who the hero was.
 Isaac met my gaze as he let go of Ben and then he looked up at Vincent with a stare that was somehow both calm and challenging at the same time.
 "What are you looking at, freak?"
 It was hard to believe Vincent could be so nonchalant after having almost killed someone.
 It'd been an accident obviously, but still that wasn't the kind of thing you just shook off.
 All of the kids that'd been rushing forward to congratulate Isaac for his heroic save started backing away.
 Anxious to avoid the fight, I tried to move with the crowd, but felt a flash of pain as my abused ankle protested.

Though it might take him months to graduate, he said he was anxious to clean things out, to get prepared, ready to move.
 On the evening of Valentine’s Day, 1963, I stopped by his house and he showed me a sack half full of small candy hearts, with slogans like, “I love you” and “Hey, sweetheart.” He picked out a half dozen that asked, “Why not?” and gave me the rest of the bag, along with instructions for tomorrow at school.
 He said, “Give one to every girl who looks like she didn’t get a valentine.” I passed some around, though not half as many as Eric would have done.
 That was Friday.
 I picked him up from work.
 We stopped at a hamburger drive-thru and at a liquor store where the proprietor had more avarice than scruples.
 On Point Loma, in Fort Rosecrans, Eric’s dad’s grave lies in a clearing with no shrubs or trees nearby to mark the spot yet, even in the dark, Eric walked right to it.
 He knelt beside it.
 A couple feet down from the headstone, he dug out a piece of sod, dropped a candy heart underneath it, and replaced the sod.
 We left the cemetery and parked just outside, and sat on the ground with our legs hanging over, about fifty feet above where the waves flooded the tide pools.

 “For now,” Qurrah said.
 “Yes.

 “I won’t like it,” he said.
 “But I’ll do it for you.”
 “We are better than them,” Qurrah said, standing so he could look through the cracks of the boards across the broken door.

They were already being hunted by the Immortalists, and gaining some allies was not a bad idea.
 But their luck would only hold so far.
 Doi’van spoke now, trying hard to be quiet, “Only men you would swear have a strong sense of honor and no one who would serve the Immortalists.” Karun glanced around the room nervously at Doi’van’s voice; it was just not made for covert conversations and his words were very dangerous.
 Then she nodded thoughtfully and the four quickly agreed that they would share the sigil with anyone who were skilled, honorable and had no love for the Immortalist Guild.
 They returned to their rooms that night tired; they had tracked down twelve more squires.
 All had at least two ribbons; and all swore secrecy at the source of their sigil.
 The biggest surprise was probably Geriodon, who had beaten Rodregas earlier that day.
 Rodregas could not argue against sharing the minor sigil as he clearly fit the description of a worthy candidate.
 Geriodon was more than happy to swear that he had no love for the Guild and that Justice should be dealt to all equally.
 But before accepting the sigil he wanted to be sure that any Shadow Order he joined was mostly about secrecy to protect themselves, and that he would still be able to compete for true knighthood in the Order of the Soaring Heavens.

It’s the most godawful honest music on the planet.
 In the end, I think that’s what has kept it so powerful, its honesty, its lack of guile.

Mrs. Campbell's class served as another safe haven.
 There were still plenty of looks, but nobody dared gossip, and Britney was safely seated on the other side of the room.
 I took a little bit of sick satisfaction over the fact that everyone else was frantic about our test tomorrow.
 I actually couldn't have been happier.
 This was the first section where I'd been in a position to sit for the exam with everyone else.
 Our lecture essentially consisted of an extended review, which I quickly realized I didn't need.
 I broke out my book and started in on one of my catch-up assignments instead.
 At the rate I was going I'd be able to take my makeup exam way ahead of schedule.
 It was a pretty lame thing to be excited about, but just having something going well for a change helped compensate for the rest of my life.
 Amazingly enough, the satisfaction from having accomplished so much shielded me for most of the rest of the day.

She just watched him.
 Rodregas knew she was wondering about his intentions.
 Did he want to share the mattress with her?
 He did of course, but this was a time of new beginnings.
 Rodregas would live and die like he had always meant to.
 He walked back to the wagon, grabbed another blanket and put it down far enough away from Imeralda to show his honorable intentions.
 But not too far in case there was trouble.
 With a big smile he laid down and slept, like he had not slept in a very long time.

 Mr. Paterson was still too new to know what he was dealing with.
 For a moment it looked like Brandon was going to let Vincent knock the teacher into a wall, but then he gestured Vincent back.
 Brandon's pack relaxed slightly, and then, presumably acting on a signal from Alec that I couldn't see, Dominic and Jasmin fell back to help Jess and I.
 Even with Dominic under my right arm, I couldn't hop along without jostling my ankle, and I felt tears gathering in the corners of my eyes again.
 Alec carefully lifted me into his arms before I took more than two or three hops.
 Jasmin had her cell phone out before she'd even made it to the stairs, and the sound of a massive engine under hard acceleration heralded the arrival of our limo.
 I leaned back in my seat as everyone else settled into their spots.
 Alec pulled out his pocket square and used it to dab away my tears.
 "I'm sorry.

 I opened my mouth to ask him what he meant, only to be distracted by the sound of the Jeep's engine as it rolled to a stop on the cement pad.
 As I looked back, Alec's eyes captured me.

Is our pride in danger?” Blodeuwedd nodded, “Yes and yes and yes.
 In their great quest for power, The Immortalist Taiga and his followers, such as that vermin Van’dret, must all be stopped.
 They do not understand that if they upset the balance that the final battle between Infernal and Celestial could destroy all.” She paused and then added in a voice that he almost thought he sensed fear in, “I think the sword Caledfwlch must be found.
 The other gods won’t like it.
 They might even oppose finding it, but it might be our only hope.” The great head nodded, and the Goddess stepped away and was gone, but the roar that followed could be heard across the grasslands and into the forest and to the peaks of the mountains beyond.
 For a moment the Heavenly Realm was silent.
 All the creatures knew the roar.
 The great Celestial Lion was on the hunt and when he found his prey, there would be a battle to shake all the realms.
 As the roar faded in the heavens, a new Knight Captain, a chosen Champion of a Goddess, stood in the great Cathedral of the Heavens.
 He heard the roar because it was his.

I hoped I looked appropriately abashed.
 As I finished the second serving, he stepped closer to sit on the misshapen rock that rose through the earth beside me.
 He held his hand wide and a canteen flew up from a pile of things on the other side of the fire.
 He passed it to me, and I tilted it back, expecting cool water.
 I almost choked when warm wine hit my throat.
 He leaned forward to get a better look at me as I lowered the container.
 He looked as if he thought I might spook, otherwise I guessed he had plenty to say hidden beneath that smirk.
 It didn’t stop him from moving uncomfortably close, though, or eyeing me with what I was certain was the same look I’d just given my meal.
 I cleared my throat, thinking I’d made my sense of discomfort clear when he started to move, but he only stood, which brought him even closer.
 Well, parts of him.

The military in many developing countries possesses the organizational capabilities and experience with intensive training to assist with this task.
 An institutional gap exists in agricultural training systems.
 In most developing countries, agricultural colleges, universities and polytechnics train researchers, government, bank employees and extension officers, but not farmers.
 Producing more food with less water, less chemicals and less soil erosion requires high levels of skill.
 The chain of agricultural training needs to be filled out at the lower level by establishing thousands of village-level farm schools as proposed in the chapter on food security.
 The switch from centrally planned to market-oriented economic systems in Eastern Europe cannot be successful until the population has acquired the skills needed to function effectively in the new economic environment.
 Under the communist system, emphasis was placed on education and training in technical subjects with little attention to marketing, organizational, commercial and interpersonal skills, which are essential requirements for functioning in a market economy.
 A detailed inventory should be compiled of the types and levels of skills needed for transition to the market, covering areas such as entrepreneurship, management, national and international marketing, strategic business planning, finance, quality control, product development, production technology, design, and human resource development.
 Intensive training programmes need to be introduced to impart these skills on a massive scale.
 Even in the most advanced industrial nations there is vast scope for upgrading skills to improve productivity and to keep pace with rapid technological development.

 Steed took some food to Anvil, Grey and Ruby made their way to the front window, and I found myself sitting alone with Chevelle.
 “How do you feel?” he asked.
 “Better.
 And worse.” Better because the dust was clearing.
 Worse because I was fuzzy again, bound.
 He nodded.
 He was closer now, sitting opposite me, and I had the disconcerting feeling that I’d lost the bit of time when he’d moved there.
 He reached out and took my hand in his, his fingers gentle as he turned it palm up to place a pebble there.
 “Can you do anything with this?” “No.” Frustration was clear in my voice.

She felt queer walking out in these clothes, but after having seen how women of this decade dressed, she knew she'd draw more attention in her Egyptian-motif dress than in this outfit.
 "Rick," she said, drawing his attention away from the people browsing in the store, "is this what they're supposed to look like?"
 His eyes grew big as he stared at her.
 The jeans revealed slender thighs, smoothly rounded hips, and, as she turned just a bit, a perfectly shaped little derriere.
 He started to reply to her question but found he had to clear his throat before he could speak.
 "You look great."
 "Really?
 Are they supposed to be this tight?"

You have elven blood in you as well.
 I wouldn’t be surprised if you lasted a couple hundred years yourself.
 This is assuming someone doesn’t kill you, which I find rather unlikely.”
 Harruq gasped at the thought.
 He had always felt akin to man and orcs, whose lives burnt out so quickly.
 The idea of living two hundred years was…‌well, more than he could handle.
 “Strange,” he said.
 “Guess I have plenty of time to learn to read, don’t I?”
 Aurelia laughed.
 “You do, but I would prefer we not take too many years.

Rodregas was pretty sure this match would decide who got the yellow first place ribbon and who would get the white.
 If Rodregas won it would give him ten total points after three competitions.
 It would give Karun twelve points if she once more came in second.
 If he lost, it would be much harder.
 Karun would have thirteen and he would have nine points.
 He was not sure how Geriodon or Nordien or the other leading contestants were doing.
 At the bell the two started to circle.
 Karun was a large woman.
 She was tall and unusually muscular.
 She moved with an easy cat-like grace and was attractive, in an about to kick your ass sort of way.

Can you hear me?”
 Only the calm, scattered sounds of the forest returned his call.
 “Damn elf,” Harruq grumbled, crossing his arms and looking all about.
 “She’s probably not here.
 He just sent me out here to look stupid yelling at trees.”
 “And what elf would that be?” asked a familiar voice from behind.
 Harruq whirled, his heart jumping as Aurelia stepped out from behind a tree.
 To his eyes, she was even more beautiful in the streaming daylight.
 Long auburn hair trailed past her shoulders, curled, and ended in several thin braids.
 Her face and eyes were small, the curve of her bones soft and elegant.

“It is time I met your brother,” Velixar said as the clouds rolled above, obscuring the waning moon.
 He had trained with Qurrah for almost two months, and over that time the half-orc had grown greatly in power.
 “King Vaelor’s nightmares have never been stronger, and he will act upon them soon.”
 “I am not sure Harruq is ready,” Qurrah said.
 “It is difficult enough bringing me here.
 The two of us sneaking out each night might be noticed.”
 “You will draw no attention,” Velixar said, ending the debate.
 “Bring him.
 Let him swear his life to me.”
 “As you wish, my master,” Qurrah said with a bow.

I spoke in barely a whisper, “Igneeria, that’s your world isn’t it?
 What does Kojas want?” The dwarf seemed to be getting extremely excited now, “He wants your world and all other worlds because he is a mighty king who wishes to expand his kingdom.” “So how would we help him do that?” I asked, stalling.
 “We just exterminate the pests.” “You’re a half-ling!
 You’re the bridge to our world.
 Now if you don’t mind we would like to finish you now, and bring you to the King.” The dwarf said politely and snickered, approaching me.
 I backed up slowly.
 “Uh, I mind a lot actually.” I said quickly but I guess they didn’t really want my opinion.
 Emily jumped out from behind the trees and lifted a flame.
 She twirled it around with the movement of her hands and shot it at the nearest dwarf.
 That started what seemed like a war.

“Which way do we go?” Harruq asked.
 “Follow me,” Qurrah said.
 The two rushed past the elaborate elven homes toward the sound of combat.
 They kept to the back alleys, and because of this, they met their first target: three elves fleeing toward them, hoping to use the lesser-known pathways to avoid the overwhelming numbers of their opponent.
 “Bring them down,” the necromancer said.
 “With pleasure,” Harruq said.
 He raised his blades and charged.
 The closest elf realized the half-orc was an enemy and cried warning before rushing ahead, his longsword ready.
 “Come on, pansy-boy,” the half-orc warrior roared.
 The two collided in a brutal exchange of steel.

Lie to me if you must, just don’t expect me to believe it.
 Forgive me for hoping you could trust me.”
 The vines released, freeing the half-orc who smacked against the ground.
 By the time he picked himself up, the vines had pulled into the dirt.
 “I have something new planned for tomorrow,” she said.
 “Don’t be late.”
 “You’re going to pay for that,” he grumbled, rubbing his sore wrists after she was gone.
 His heart was not in it, though.
 More than anything, he was embarrassed and frightened about losing control.

My mouth twisted, and I shifted into a run until I reached the little outcropping of rock on the west side of the village.
 I was still thinking about it when I slowed to climb through the tangle of brush in back of Junnie’s house, but once my fingers trailed the cool rock surrounding the structure, it fell away.
 When it felt as if I could breathe again, I rapped two quick knocks and then one loud knock on the small wooden door.
 It was the one sure way she’d know it was me.
 A wisp of bright blonde hair swirled around Junnie’s shining eyes as the door swung open, and I decided I must have caught her working; she looked flustered.
 Junnie was older than I, but remained striking with the blonde hair, blue eyes, and thin features that seemed to be standard-issue among the village elves.
 The Council had assigned her as my tutor, citing my advanced age as the reason I couldn’t learn with the others, but I suspected it was my stunning lack of ability that had landed me here.
 Junnie brushed a lock of hair aside.
 “There you are, my Fredora!” She was always trying out new nicknames for me.
 It was no secret I despised my given name: Elfreda Georgiana Suzetta Glaforia.

When his eyes returned to mine, he smiled.
 He liked playing with fire.
 And then he shoved the fireball toward me with frightening speed.
 I threw both hands in front of me, palms out, and forced the largest mass I could in response.
 Chevelle flicked his wrist and the flame dodged up and angled back toward me.
 I shook my hands frantically, spitting sharp bullets of heat at it, hoping to break it up.
 But he pulled his hands apart and the thing split, each side curving toward me; there were two now, closing in fast.
 I leapt forward just as they collided where I’d been standing and lost my footing while I watched the fireworks behind me.
 Spinning into a tumble to keep from landing flat on my face, I rolled to my feet, still thrilling from the fire play.
 From magic.

My two kids lived with me and cost plenty.
 So I started teaching all around.
 One semester, I taught nine classes at four colleges, about 90 hours a week, which left me too weary to write, or so I thought.
 My son Cody and I went to Tae Kwon Do classes twice a week.
 And I was managing Cody’s Little League team, hoping he might become a pitcher instead of a ninja.
 Probably because I didn’t sleep enough, my emotions had shut down, and every day I sensed impending doom.
 Something had to change.
 My kids didn’t deserve a catatonic dad.
 One late afternoon as I sat on the grass at the University of San Diego, overlooking the harbor and wondering how I could fix my emotions, I mumbled, “Okay, where should I start?” Then I remembered advice Master Jeong, our Tae Kwon Do instructor, often gave.
 He told us, "Everything begins with the spirit.

This is the all-powerful driving force that has so radically transformed the social landscape during this ‘century of the common man’.
 This is the ultimate ‘rationale’ behind the inevitable claim of the poor everywhere that will be made with ever-growing insistence and impatience until it is finally granted – as the birthright of every human being – freedom, food, education, employment, prosperity and fulfilment for all.
 Perspectives for the New Millennium
 The individual effect, complex linkages, mutually supportive interactions and consequent cumulative impact of these two revolutions and the nine other factors propelling global change are incalculable.
 They make this a rare moment in history for a quantum leap forward, which many have dreamed about but few believed achievable.
 Seizing this opportunity requires, most importantly of all, a change in awareness, attitude and perspective.
 Several ideas will be of abiding value in our endeavour to make the most of this rare moment.
 Our present problems and future potentials can only be understood when viewed from a wider historical perspective that avoids getting lost in the media-driven drama and intensity of momentary crisis and short-term trends.
 As recent global action to protect the environment amply demonstrates, public awareness and understanding are growing too rapidly and becoming too important in global affairs for us to rely on the present positions of governments or current public sentiment as gauges of what may be achieved in the near future.
 More reliable indices of what is possible are the underlying currents that are rapidly raising the value of the human being, bringing nations together in ever-closer co-operation and mutual interdependence, and pressing the international community to raise its goals.

She righted it, twisting the blade for me to see.
 My stomach dropped.
 “There are a few things you need to remember when using a blade,” she instructed.
 “First of all, always go for the fatal attack.
 If you merely wound someone, well, someone with magic will use the last of their power to stop you.
 Cut off their head or puncture the lung and heart.
 Never mess around.” I imagined myself decapitating someone.
 I laughed as I realized my mind placed Fannie there.
 Ruby didn’t look like she could think of anything funny about what she’d said, but she continued.
 “Secondly, don’t cut yourself.

The elves broke formation as the barrage approached.
 The first ten, however, were too close to have hope.
 Bone shredded wings and scattered feathers.
 The elves that were alive when their horses landed died by the clawing hands of rotted flesh.
 Dieredon looped in the sky, his confidence shaken at the sight of so many of his dying friends.
 He fired arrows three at a time, his quiver never approaching empty.
 He ordered Sonowin lower, shouting out the command as another barrage of bone pelted four more elves to their deaths.
 Skimming above the darkness, Dieredon fired volley after volley behind him.
 When they were past the undead, he pulled Sonowin high into the air to observe the battlefield.
 The ranks of the undead were half of what they had been, yet still he could not see the lowered black hood he so badly needed to see.

He simply nodded toward Rodregas.
 Rodregas left the square and the knight sent the next two in.
 By mid morning Rodregas had cleared out his square without major effort.
 He noticed that all the other squares were still going on.
 His matches had ended faster than the others.
 His body’s balance of strength and speed were at full advantage in hand-to-hand fighting.
 He fought three others at the end of the afternoon; all three had won their group of matches.
 Rodregas thought that they might have been tough opponents if they had not been so beaten up.
 Between the natural durability of his body and the minor Sigil of Healing though, he was feeling fine.
 The knights were clearly trying to find the best five among the competitors.

“You stay here.
 No moving around.” He told me that in the case of a weapon, they would come in from both sides of the truck with their guns drawn.
 The shooting officers would be on the driver’s side firing over my head.
 (How comforting).
 What had I gotten myself into?
 I didn’t want brains splattered all over my truck, especially if they were mine!
 I was then shown pictures so I could verify Ashley and recognize Steve.

As soon as Rodregas started to drink it, he realized he was starving.
 “I need more,” Rodregas croaked as he finished the bowl.
 The Nymph, an older man who unlike any Nymph Rodregas was familiar with, had his hair pulled back in a pony tail, nodded but said, “Slowly, too much right away is not good for you.” Rodregas nodded and cleared his throat; which was dry and felt like it had pebbles in it.
 While the bed was normal enough, the walls of the room were strange and seemed to be made of woven branches and some sort of hide or dark canvas pulled between tree branches to form an oval shape.
 “Doi’van and Imeralda, do they live?” he got the words out, though it hurt his throat to speak.
 “Oh, yes, Imeralda is fine,” the Nymph healer responded.
 “She was not hurt at all.
 Doi’van was injured pretty badly, but not as badly as you are.
 You both should be dead from your wounds several times over.
 I thought at first you both had a sigil of healing, that would be the only way for you two to be alive, but Imeralda says that you are both ‘of the blood.’ You are a lucky man, even with your blood, to be alive.” “May I speak to them?” Rodregas asked as he looked around the room or tent.

I started college and rented an apartment with Kenny Niedermeyer who was suffering more than any of us over Eric’s death, since the car was his and Sylvia blamed him.
 She would call and scream “Murderer!” and accuse him of stealing the twenty dollars Eric took with him that day.
 Here's something she wrote and sent him: Jingle for Rope Jumpers Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear, Eric's dead.
 They pushed him, and they beat him and they smashed him in the head.
 He gurgled and he growled, he suffered and he bled.
 Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear, Eric's dead.

 Bob Williams often hung around our apartment.
 About half way through the fall semester, President Kennedy got bushwhacked.

I mean, coming into humanity, opening the door that we all have to open, and then making something of your feelings, your flow, well, that’s what was going on with me at 14.
 And Debbie, well, she was just so young and lovely.
 The first time she took my cock out was in her backyard, leaning against her house, her mother moving around in the kitchen right over our heads—this is what you did back then.
 Were parents oblivious?
 I don’t know.
 Anyway, she takes it out---and this is like the first time either of us has bared anything except our souls and she was just fascinated with it.
 And I don’t know where this knowledge comes from but she knew immediately how to do what needed to be done.
 She was jerking on me so expertly—well, hell, maybe anything feels right the first time—and, very quickly—I was young---I squirted all over both of us.
 It was a surprise.
 I don’t know what she expected to happen but there was this like fountain, as if I had stored it up for a decade, and there was some on her hand, her forearm, her shirt.

“You need me?”
 The smaller half-orc opened the bag he carried.

"Hmmm?
 Oh.
 Nothing."
 Standing on tiptoe, she kissed his cheek.
 "I'll go change clothes and be right back."
 She wished she could wear her sneakers, she mused as she roamed through the garden in her bulky black shoes.
 But she couldn't very well walk into her house wearing shorts and sneakers.
 She did, however, have on black lace underwear that she'd gotten at the mall.
 No one would know about that, and it would be a reminder of her adventure in 2011.
 She wandered full circle and, for the first time, wasn't disappointed when she saw Rick's fountain.

The air was still as he inclined his head toward Chevelle and then turned, a long, dark braid whipping behind him as he disappeared into the brush.
 This seemed to mean something to the group, something like relief.
 I stared after him, but Anvil stepped forward, thumping his balled fist against his chest in a gesture I didn’t understand.
 Grey followed, repeating the action and adding a single nod, and Ruby clasped her hands, bouncing excitedly from heel to toe.
 I felt myself drawing back together, tied by the knots in my stomach and mind.
 A tandem wolf howl sounded in the distance.
 My stomach swam in unease.

That energy surged out of the circle and swirled around inside the larger outer circle.
 Every hair on Rodregas’ body stood at attention.
 Then the blue flaming energy was sucked into the pale green circle.
 There the prisoner, now empty of his own essence, stood still.
 As the blue fire was sucked into his body, the corporal body suddenly seemed more solid than before.
 Once more Ravenhurr yelled out in his melodious voice the trigger words for the next part of the ritual, “Mana faria podia ricoria.” It was now or never for Rodregas to strike.
 Rodregas raised his arm up and threw his club forward with all his strength.
 There was no time to see if his club hit Junnit or if the half AElfin maiden ran.
 Rodregas half ran and half jumped to the next circle, where Ravenhurr stood with raised arms.
 Ravenhurr was focused on his inner magic and was not prepared for his own guards’ sudden action.

Though I couldn’t yet fathom how the simple fact that I was me, amongst all the billion people on earth, should give even a moment of solace, it did.
 Shortly before Easter, my Aunt Woody invited my mom for a Las Vegas weekend.
 Eric and I decided to join them.
 All night we sped across the desert.
 My mom and aunt were dressed for breakfast by the time we arrived, to their surprise and dismay.
 They loaned us their room until evening.
 Room service delivered bourbon and ginger ale.
 Around noon, we adjourned to the pool, on the lookout for showgirls.

I sensed someone close to me, Ruby no doubt.
 She would drug me.
 I didn’t want that.
 I didn’t want that ever again.
 I slid from the pain, reaching out.
 I found nothing but the horses, but I would take it.
 I left my body completely.
 My entry was so furious it startled the horse.
 I held him there, but when he raised his head from grazing, he was facing them.
 They were standing, kneeling, surrounding my limp body.

Another thought came to him.
 “Or was it you, Qurrah Tun?”
 He raced back to Woodhaven, his mind decided.
 It was time he had a talk with one of the brothers Tun.

 Harruq arrived at the sparring point in the forest less disheveled than the previous day, and he seemed in better spirits.
 “So what is your surprise for me?” he asked.

Some of them, I’m still proud of.
 I still love “Sandra Leathers.”  And I like Cocker’s version of “Sins of Monk Casaba.” “Satori at the Bitter Lemon,” “Call it the End of Enchantment,” “ Drudge’s Questions,” “The Dotage of a Fairy Tale Hero”…
 LE:  	It was Cassava, dear.
 BG: 	Yeah, right.
 I don’t remember them all.
 For obvious reasons.
 I still like “Overton Park Picnic” especially Soft Machine’s version.
 “Peace is Declared,” “We Bombed in New Haven,” “Wear your Nehru,” “Iris,” “Art Kane’s Jazz Photograph,” uh, “Chloe’s Ancient Face,” “Jack and Neal and Martin Milner”—(laughs), that one for Tiny Tim.
 That still makes me laugh.

Peace is the social dividend of democracy.
 Peace is not merely the absence of war.
 It is a settled, stable, secure condition which thrives on a foundation of political maturity, social freedom and economic well-being.
 A world in which all major military powers – with the present exclusion of China – have democratic governments removes the ideological basis and political pressure for confrontation between states.
 If it is maintained, the adoption of democratic forms of government by the nations of Eastern Europe and the developing world will help ensure peaceful relations between states, which is the most fundamental precondition for accelerated economic development.
 The marriage of democracy and disarmament can transform the world – abolishing wars, eliminating nuclear arsenals, liberating hundreds of billions of dollars for building a better common future.
 In economic terms, the shift to democratic government presents an opportunity for more rapid development in these countries.
 During the post-war period of technology-driven industrialization, there is a strong correlation between a representative form of government and rapid economic development.
 This relationship is reciprocal.
 In democratic countries freedom of expression and exposure to independent media awaken people to expectation of a better life and encourage them to take initiatives that lead to prosperity.

Safety Nets: Long-term solution to the problem of food security requires efforts that will make people food self-sufficient.
 But until those efforts can be put in place and made effective, continued reliance will have to be placed on public programmes such as India’s highly successful Mid-Day Meal scheme for school children and Food for Work programs that combine employment and food security.
 The traditional concept of Food for Work needs to be enlarged to include skilled work related to human and social development.
 A Global Food Guarantee scheme should be put in place, which combines Food for Work and Employment Guarantee in a systematic manner.
 Human Development
 Development is a human process.
 It is the result of human aspirations turned into action, human energies expressed in thought and work, human imagination and creativity turned toward the upliftment of life, the invention of processes and products to enhance human productivity, the accumulation of knowledge and wisdom passed on from one generation to another, the acquisition and perfection of skills transmitted from parent to child, the conversion of talents into capacities, the pursuit of ideals, an ever widening of attitudes, and the evolution of more complex and productive forms of organization.
 As this evolutionary process unfolds, each element of human personality -- physical skill, vital relationship, mental understanding, spiritual values – is enhanced in a progression without end, bringing with it greater material fruits, richer life experience, and higher knowledge.
 The unfolding and flowering of the human being is at once the source and the goal of development.
 Thus, in all our efforts to elevate human society, our primary endeavour must be to enhance these human endowments and expand individual freedom of self-expression.

“ _Seventy?_ ”
 The elf laughed.
 “Don’t be too shocked.
 You have elven blood in you as well.
 I wouldn’t be surprised if you lasted a couple hundred years yourself.
 This is assuming someone doesn’t kill you, which I find rather unlikely.”
 Harruq gasped at the thought.
 He had always felt akin to man and orcs, whose lives burnt out so quickly.
 The idea of living two hundred years was…‌well, more than he could handle.

 I mean, coming into humanity, opening the door that we all have to open, and then making something of your feelings, your flow, well, that’s what was going on with me at 14.
 And Debbie, well, she was just so young and lovely.
 The first time she took my cock out was in her backyard, leaning against her house, her mother moving around in the kitchen right over our heads—this is what you did back then.
 Were parents oblivious?
 I don’t know.
 Anyway, she takes it out---and this is like the first time either of us has bared anything except our souls and she was just fascinated with it.

I opened my mouth, but just simply didn't know what to say.
 The horror of being trapped in a body that was riddled with old injuries was something thousands of people faced every day, but it seemed even more of a shame for someone who'd once been so vital and strong.
 Mallory's smile held only the faintest hint of regret.
 "No need to feel sorry for me.
 I've had a good run.
 A much better one than most of my friends did.
 If I haven't managed to accomplish what I was sent down to do in the course of almost a hundred and fifty years, then I've nobody to blame but myself."
 "Still, I'm sorry.

This view could be summed up in the often expressed attitude, ‘Good economics makes good politics!’
 Transition is the process by which society moves from one form or level of activities to another.
 While social scientists conveniently divide social activity into several categories – political, economic, social, educational, religious, cultural – in practice these distinctions are at best only partially true.
 Economic activities in any society take place on the foundation of the political system, social values and customs, and the psychological aspirations and attitudes of the people.
 During normal periods of slow and gradual change, the impact or role of other dimensions operates below the surface and appears minimal.
 Economists studying the results of economic variables tend to overlook the influence of factors from other fields on the assumption that non-economic factors are constant.
 Under relatively stable and static conditions, these economics principles can be employed to predict changes in economic variables to a considerable extent.
 But under circumstances in which underlying economic, social and political conditions are undergoing radical change, the relevance and predictive capacity of purely economic concepts is quite limited.
 This was the situation confronting the states of the region at the beginning of the transition period, and the reason why the actual results of the reform differed so drastically from what had been anticipated.
 The situation in Eastern and Central Europe was further complicated by the disproportionately large size and importance of the defence sector in the economy.

 Brandon looked up as I walked into the cafeteria, and waved me over.
 As I threaded between a pair of closely-set tables I noticed that Alec's table seemed unusually unsettled.
 If a shouting match could be conducted in whispers, it was being done by Jasmin and James, neither of who looked like they were happy about whatever was being discussed.
 Alec wasn't talking, but from the way he was scanning the room, he didn't want to be there anymore than the rest of them.
 I made it to Brandon's table, and was still pulling my meal replacement drink out of my bag when the loudspeaker clicked on with the obligatory burst of static.
 "This is Principal Gossil and I've got an exciting announcement.
 The school is sponsoring a trip to Las Vegas to see the production of Les Misérables that just started.

 It was like someone had rifled through my mind to pick out my biggest disappointment in recent days, pulled it out and rubbed salt on the wound before cramming it back inside me.

His call unheeded, the United States has been forced to spend billions of dollars fighting drugs crimes and expanding prisons due to the rapid increase of drugs consumption in America.
 By a strange circuitous mechanism, the savings to consumers in developed nations by the refusal of their governments to negotiate international commodity agreements favour able to developing countries has cost these governments and their economies tens of billions of dollars in the form of loan write-offs and crime fighting.
 If an international commission in the 1970s had tried to point out this linkage between low agricultural incomes in Colombia and drug-related crime in New York, London or Moscow, it would have been readily dismissed.
 But this is the type of understanding and perspective needed by governments and international agencies today to formulate effective policy measures in an interdependent world.
 Cooperative Security
 Eliminating nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles and small arms proliferation are practical measures whose time has come.
 But by themselves these steps will only mitigate the most pernicious threats to international security.
 They will not provide an effective system for ensuring the peace and security of all nations that is so vitally needed, and now so imminently possible, as a basis for accelerating the political, economic and social development of humankind.
 The end of the Cold War provides us with the opportunity, and pressing global issues provide the urgency, for more significant measures.
 These measures cannot be conceived within the perspective of international security that has dominated our thinking in the post-war period, or from a half-hearted desire to modestly improve what to some still appears an adequate and acceptable system.

I think that’s right.
 Funny thing is, you know, she was kind of a fox.
 Too foxy to try and control a roomful of libidos.
 She dressed like a stewardess, I remember.
 Anyway, she took one look at this patch on my ass and drew in her breath as if I had a picture of a couple fucking on my jeans—she literally turned white.
 And sent me to the office, with a note recommending my suspension.
 I laugh now, but, hell, I was a little frightened.
 I mean, I hated school, right?
 but I didn’t want to be kicked out of it.

“Choo!” I glanced up at Evelyn through the jagged line of my bangs.
 “A… a… choo!” she wheezed.
 Elves didn’t sneeze.
 Fairies sneezed.

 I giggled.
 Evelyn shot a glower at me.
 And then she whirled, storming away, and as she glanced back, her parting expression was so priceless I wished I could see it again.

All he could think of was wielding his swords in battle.
 “Which way do we go?” he asked.
 “I know the way,” Qurrah said, his eyes lingering on the whip curled about his right arm.
 “Their nightmares are crying out to me.
 You have prepared them, haven’t you master?”
 The man in black nodded.
 “They know death is coming.
 So go.”
 Qurrah bowed once more and then began walking west.
 Harruq followed.

 He turned back to look at her.
 "Would you rather I didn't?"
 She smiled.
 "I'd rather that you did."
 He returned with a novel that he pretended to read.
 His mind was replaying all the day's events, and he kept peering at Marie over the top of the book.
 She'd washed her makeup off, and she looked like a child, her lashes dark against smooth, rosy skin, one small hand beneath her cheek.
 She was such an innocent young woman and was, as he’d read, vibrant and fun-loving.
 Even her natural fear of having walked into the future was more often than not suppressed by her sense of adventure.

It turned out they did.
 An arrow flew across the room and pierced his shoulder when he reached the second floor.
 He bellowed, letting the pain spark his rage.
 One archer continued to fire out the window, believing his companion capable of finishing a single warrior.
 He believed wrong.
 The elf fired only one more shot before Harruq crossed the room.
 The arrow lodged into Harruq’s side, and then Salvation tore through his bow and into flesh.
 A kick sent the remains tumbling out the window.
 The other archer pulled back and fired at point blank range.
 Harruq roared as he felt a sharp pain bite into his neck.

Down the steps and across the quad, his legs churned faster than the eye could register, like a propeller.
 The previous fall he had broken our school record for the 50-yard dash.
 The coach and a few ROTC kids gave chase.
 They all disappeared into a stand of eucalyptus.
 Most of the teachers and ROTC tailed behind.
 Others returned to the basketball game, leaving Billy, Eric and me unguarded.
 We slipped away, into the shadows beside a row of classrooms.
 As we stood there assessing our options, Eric said, “Get Billy out of here.” He pointed to a parking lot.
 “Go down there and hide till you can hitch a ride.” “So, you’re going to find Kenny?” I asked.
 “Or what?” Staring at his feet, kicking the dirt, Eric said, “I’m going to stay and take my punishment.” “For what?

By then, several more of his friends had died from an OD or were in rehab or prison.
 We chatted and the officers said that they called Brandon the “one percent kid” due to his progress through recovery.
 They also joked about how I was still the talk of the narcotics and uniform officers as this crazy father who went undercover to save his son’s ass.
 It was an odd gathering but I know the officers enjoyed it and I know they appreciated that their efforts had a positive result on someone.
 While we had Brandon home for this brief time we also attended a family wedding.
 The four of us, Brandon, Bryce, Lisa and myself, drove together several hours north to a coastal town in northern California.
 We all stayed in the same quaint roadside motel near a popular camping spot called Patrick’s Point.
 It was woodsy and cool and we shared a two-bedroom unit with a common kitchen and a family room with a fireplace.
 It wasn’t much but it was everything to my wife and me.
 We took long walks as a family and we talked like we hadn’t in years, or possibly ever.

“I’ll be,” he said.
 “It is real.
 No illusion and no disguise.
 You two cretins have god-damned elf blood in you.”
 “You jest,” Qurrah said, hanging back and showing no sign of aggression.
 The soldiers clearly thought Harruq the more dangerous of the two, and he was more than willing to let them continue thinking that.
 “No jest,” the guard said.
 “You two are leaving this city, now.”
 “My things,” Harruq said, his voice coming out as a weak croak.
 “I don’t see anything,” said the guard, scooping down and retrieving the scattered coins Harruq had dropped.

I spit out the clump of wiry hair that had somehow found its way into my gasping mouth.
 I felt a searing pain as the Thrasher raked my left leg.
 I closed my eyes against the pain, trying to focus myself against the dull throb in my shin.
 Then the thrasher went limp against me.
 It was hauled off of my body and I found myself looking up into the face of a very unhappy dark blue haired boy.
 His sword was gripped tightly in his clenched fingers and a look of amusement, or many it was anger, shone on his face.
 I swallowed and collected my weapons from the ground, not daring to look at my leg.
 “Hi Seth, this is unexpected.” Seth glared at me and pulled me up.
 He was definitely angry at me.
 I tried to place weight on my leg but winced as pain shot up it.

In the studio it’s all just overlaying now, you know, so some of these cats, I don’t even know their names.
 I hate that.
 I hate that I sing a song and then they come in and lay some harpsichord or Jew’s harp or whatever behind it.
 But, that’s the times, man, I gotta go with the times.
 Still, I insist on a certain honesty, a certain interplay in the studio, and this places me solidly on the outside.

By the same equation, the more we love ourselves, the more inclined to evil we are, while the more we love God and others, the more we may achieve good.
 As I pull back onto Highway 101, I concluded the greatest evil must be done by those totally in the grip of self-love, and the greatest good by those closest to the annihilation of self.
 I can't find any flaws in that equation, except as regards finding the way along the path away from self-love.
 Dostoyevski maintained our nature compels us to strive toward the love of God and others.
 But preachers often argue that striving does us no good whatever, that in order to grow toward love we need to surrender our selves to God and ask him to lead us.
 Some preachers would contend we can count on God's direct leading, through prayer and messages we will receive if we listen.
 Others would tell us to rely on God indirectly, by reading and following the example of Christ and the principles he gave.
 In the Sermon on the Mount alone, Christ urges us to keep our desires in check, speak the truth, give sacrificially, set aside worries, pray, withhold judgment except about our own thoughts and actions, and ask for good gifts such as wisdom.
 Mostly to slow my whirling mind, I speak a prayer, a request I have often made, asking God to help me love better.
 And what comes is a reminder of something I've been told more than once.

From where there was nothing something now exists: songs, recordings, an album.
 The making of Turntable Poison was a liminal time, a time of congruity, or grand passion.
 The melding of the three (sometimes four) musicians was a Synchronicity.
 It can happen more than once but it happened at least once for Black Lung.
 It’s there on that vinyl circle, waiting for the needle like a junkie.
 And for anyone lucky enough to find that masterpiece in someone’s garage sale, in some second-hand record shop (where I hear it can go for upwards of a hundred dollars or more), at some friend’s apartment, there is knowledge passed.
 Because anyone who hears Turntable Poison hears right away what could have been, what should have been.
 What was.
 The album smokes.
 It tears down ceiling tiles.

“Why did she do that?
 She could have run faster without the child!”
 No, he knew that answer.
 She would not abandon her child just as he would not abandon Qurrah.
 Then what was bothering him so?
 He fell to his knees and stabbed the old weapons into the dirt.
 The faces of those he had killed danced before his eyes, especially the mother and her child, and the young girl holding her little sister.
 The fear in their eyes.
 The screams.
 The panic.

Right?”
 Aurelia shrugged.
 “We’re outnumbered four to one.
 We might win, but we’ll still suffer many deaths.
 If I am needed, I will fight.”
 “No,” Harruq said, running up and grabbing her arms.
 “No, you must understand, you can’t fight.
 You can’t!”
 “Why?” she asked as tears formed in her eyes.
 “I can’t lose you, Aurelia.

His eyes passed over Rodregas to glance at the prisoners.
 He nodded without a word and went back to peering through the tube.
 Rodregas had never understood how the stars in the night sky could make the world closer or farther away from the Celestial Realm, where the Gods lived, or how that could affect magic, but he knew the placement of the stars was critical to the success of the ceremony tonight.
 Ravenhurr was an attractive man, like most of the Immortalist Sorcerers.
 After all, if you can pick your body, why would you ever choose an ugly one?
 Rodregas looked over again at the man that he had brought up the stairs.
 With the ability to select your body you would choose someone like that: attractive, talented and a natural athlete.
 Rodregas stood to the side waiting for Ravenhurr’s signal.
 Ravenhurr raised his head up from the tube again and scanned the rooftop making sure all the parts of the ceremony were in place.
 Rodregas had always thought that it was only Ravenhurr’s eyes that gave away the fact that what was inside him was not as attractive as his exterior.

Keep a few guards at the gate, but only the minimum needed.
 But that does remind me.
 Release any remaining prisoners and make sure they are fed and clothed, and allow them to make their way back to their homes.” “That has some danger to it,” said Captain Poir hurriedly, his expression returning to a look of concern.
 “True,” he replied.
 “But do as I command,” Rodregas stated in his firmest voice.
 Captain Poir nodded and immediately said, “As you command, master.” Rodregas started to open the door to the stairway when another thought hit him, and he turned back to the captain, and said, “I need time to adjust.
 Make sure that I am not disturbed in my quarters tonight, but tell Adapt Korin that before he leaves to celebrate, to come up to my room for some last minute instructions.” Captain Poir responded with his very military, “Yes sir.”  Rodregas had to admit while most of the guards were no better trained than a ruffian off the street the captain had served with The Immortal Guards and he was highly trained and disciplined.
 Rodregas had always wondered what had brought a man of his obvious military background to serve Ravenhurr; thank goodness he clearly did not understand the simplest things about magic.
 On the other hand, the AElf maiden clearly had some ideas.
 He was glad she was gagged and not able to speak, and the guards knew better than to release a mage from her bindings until they had to.

Barrels of who-knows-what lined the side of our back fence.
 I guess the rent is cheaper when you live next to a toxic dump!
 We had a yard for our dogs and new friends to meet and we settled into this little house.
 My brother and I still shared a room, as we always had, and we still had each other despite another change in schools and friends.
 At dinner sometimes, Mom wouldn’t eat.
 She would say she wasn’t hungry or offer some excuse.
 I would later realize that she fed us first because she was so broke she couldn’t afford to feed herself.
 In all the years after the divorce, she had never received a dime in child support from my biological father, Richard.
 There were times at this house when my mother would have us hide in the closet with her.
 This would happen when the rent was past due.

As the roar faded in the heavens, a new Knight Captain, a chosen Champion of a Goddess, stood in the great Cathedral of the Heavens.

Her hand formed the wildlife, and to tend her creation she created elves.
 The goddess gave them long life and abundant land so quarrels within their race were of the petty sort.
 Then the brother gods came.
 Ashhur of Justice, Karak of Order.
 There are many worlds beyond our own, Qurrah.
 I have seen fleeting glimpses of them in my dreams.
 Karak and Ashhur came from one of those worlds, and Celestia welcomed them.
 To them she gave the grasslands and rolling hills.
 “These brother gods did not make their own creation.
 Instead, they made man, much the same as man existed in their former world.

You’ve never read the special edition series or Sumo Assassin, it’s even worse than most tabloids, they don’t even bother to make full sentences or finish thoughts.
 Which is damn near impossible to accomplish without trying to do so.
 Karen - But if you can show that much loyalty to something so terrible for so long, well Elizabeth is a lucky woman.
 Art – Lucky to have won the loyalty of a dork like my son.
 Jim – You’re telling me.
 She must have accumulated some bad Karma?
 Karen – Well aside from reading Sumo Assassin, what do you enjoy doing?
 (Liz enters, carrying one last serving bowl behind Karen and Art, Jim can see her)
 Jim – Well, I like sitting and lying down on this couch, watching television, playing video games, and when she lets me, touching Elizabeth’s breasts.
 Liz – Which won’t be any time soon if you keep this up.

He ran his fingers over it, enjoying the feeling of pure gold.
 When he covered the second half, he paused.

 He kept his hand where it was.

It was like… like I wasn’t alone.
 Someone else was there, dreaming with me, and I could see their dreams.
 They mixed with mine, creating chaos.
 There were faces I didn’t recognize and those I did.
 I dreamt of Steed, winking conspiratorially… mine.
 A large and frightening dark-haired man in leather and armor… not mine.
 My room in the old tree, my mother’s pendant casting rainbows on the bed… mine.
 A long, damp stone corridor lit with torches… not mine.
 There was Junnie, her blonde hair shining in the sun as she greeted me at her door on the west side of the village.
 And Junnie, mysterious under a hooded cloak, fighting with magic and weaponry, killing members of the council guard.

I felt the tiny hairs on my neck stand up as the feeling redoubled yet again.
 The darker, more vocal of the two opened his mouth and got the first part of a swear word out before ending in a hiss of pain that was almost completely drowned out by a crescendo from the orchestra pit.
 Alec leaned forward, whispered something in each of their ears, and then finally let both of them go.
 I expected them to turn around swinging, or at least swear at him.
 I didn't expect them to remain in their seats stunned and shaking like trauma victims.
 An usher finally arrived to see what all of the commotion was about.
 The older boys shook themselves and then looked for a second like they were going to try and get Alec kicked out of the theater.
 The sense of being caught in some kind of electric sandstorm momentarily intensified, and then faded away as they got up and left.
 I felt my mouth drop open again as they scurried out of the theater without once looking back.
 Alec, who I'd always figured had the depth of an old-style Mickey Mouse cartoon, had just faced down two older boys, and singlehandedly saved my Les Misérables experience.

The object of our discussion was currently backing away from James while trying to keep Jessica from circling around behind him.
 I finally realized what I'd always thought of as grace was really an economy of motion.
 It was like he was saving every possible bit of energy because he never knew when he'd find it necessary to burn up his reserves in a blaze of violence.
 Even as I watched, he spun around, plucking Jessica out of the air, grabbing her by the head mid-leap as she sought to find purchase on this throat.
 He tried to spin back around to meet James' rush, but the smaller hybrid knocked him down with a crash.
 Isaac and Jasmin were there in a blink, tearing the other two wolves off of Alec before the conflict could turn deadly.
 I couldn't breathe until the dust settled, and Alec rolled back up to his feet, dripping blood from a large gash in his side.
 Dominic heard my sudden gasp and reached over to reassure me.
 "He's okay.
 We heal fast, and he heals faster than most."

 All human discomfort is just a test of strength to sort out the unworthy and separate the wheat from the chaff.

 Art – Humans don’t need than faith.
 Faith is just a crutch to lean upon.
 A way to convince yourself that there is some reason for all the pain and humiliation.
 Rather than grasping reality and actually doing something to help the world, people with faith just wait for luck to see them through.

The battle was over…‌but would the man in black obey the call?
 She thought not.
 Suddenly a hand closed about her mouth.
 The foul smell of sweat and dirt filled her nostrils.
 An arm reached around, pinning her staff and hands against her chest.
 “We may have to leave,” a voice growled into her ear, “but I’m not leaving without something to remember.”
 Aurelia felt her stomach churn.
 Her assailant turned her around and flung her back against the wall.
 She glared at a pock-marked soldier bearing the crest of Neldar.
 “You’re a pretty one,” he said, his smile missing several teeth.

Seth was emotionless; he didn’t give any sign on what he was feeling.
 “So you felt like getting us back?” Jason asked.
 Emily glared at him, “You deserved it because you soaked us too.” “So,” he rolled his eyes, “you thought you could just ambush us.
 Have you learned nothing and that we might want revenge now.

Values are a powerful instrument to spur development.
 They are goals or standards that set the direction and mobilize the collective cultural energies of the society for great accomplishment.
 They prompt us to strive for the maximum that is conceivable, rather than the mini mum that is achievable.
 Values form the basis for the tremendous developmental achievements of the past two hundred years, such as the Japanese commitment to teamwork and consensus, the American devotion to enterprise and innovation, the German dedication to quality, and the Dutch commitment to partnership with other people, rather than exploitation.
 Development is retarded by the slow pace at which new values are acquired, which normally requires a change of generation.
 But values can also be consciously transmitted through education in order to abridge the time needed for transition.
 The efforts over the last ten years to implement the value of environmental security illustrate the range of knowledge, information, attitudes, institutions, systems, and skills needed to achieve any high value in life.
 The recommendations presented in this report are intended to form a basis for identifying and providing the values, attitudes, organizations and skills needed to achieve peace and prosperity at the dawn of the third millennium.
 It is well known that societies which are able to harness their cultural energies for development tend to progress very rapidly.
 Yet at the same time, we know that cultural factors can also be a barrier to rapid progress.

 He walked silently at her side.
 When they were back inside, she didn't go upstairs to change.
 Instead, she went to the living room and sat in a corner of the sofa, erecting an invisible wall between them.
 Bewildered and a little hurt, he sat down on the opposite end and turned on the TV.
 After a few minutes of channel surfing, he pressed the mute button.
 "What's wrong, sweetheart?"
 he asked, turning toward Marie.
 "Are you homesick?"
 "Don't call me that."

“I would have it no other way,” Velixar said.
 A hand touched his forehead.
 All the anger that had raged inside Harruq roared like a fire suddenly loosed upon a dry forest.
 Sweat poured from his skin.
 His head jerked upward, his eyes soaking in the white of Velixar’s hand and the dim glow of the stars.
 Power flowed into him, his muscles stretching and tightening in a chaotic manner.
 “Rise, Harruq Tun,” Velixar said.
 “Revel in the power of Karak.”
 “By the gods, brother, if you could see yourself,” Qurrah said, his voice full of shock and wonder.
 “Just one god, Qurrah,” Velixar corrected.

The world needs a coherent intellectual framework for understanding and dealing with radical transitions.
 High priority should be given to developing a fresh conceptual approach that is not en cumbered by allegiance to existing theories and systems.
 Transitions should be regarded as social transformations which depend on and result in corresponding changes in the political, economic and other spheres.
 Efforts to guide a multi-dimensional social transition through uni-dimensional strategies, particularly those limited to manipulation of macro-economic policy, are unlikely to yield the anticipated results.
 Even those transitions which are apparently confined to economic activities within a stable political context necessarily depend on changes in social attitudes and in social institutions which can be dealt with most effectively by assuming a wider perspective of the process.
 Clear visualization of the before and after states of transition, the existing system, the goals to be sought after, and a detailed picture of the changes that need to occur in behaviour, attitudes and institutions are necessary for deriving the most effective transition strategies.
 With the knowledge the world possesses today, with the example of many successful nations over the last four decades, and with its highly educated and motivated people, surely the nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia can abridge the time required and the hardship of lessons learned by trial and error to a few years.
 But this cannot be accomplished by sweeping remedies or hastened by over-eagerness or impatience.
 It will require application of a profound understanding of the process of development and transition.
 We believe that a properly conceived effort to draw on the best available knowledge and experience of other countries can generate a transition strategy that avoids the dangers and pitfalls of the initial approach to reform and puts in place the essential foundations for the new system to function effectively and generate benefits for the people before the dawn of the new century.

Rodregas flexed his shoulders.
 He had the physical power of a Celestial Lion, but blows from mounted lancers had the power to hurt.
 “I think I need to change shields,” he said.
 Doi’van glanced at what remained of Rodregas’ shield and simply nodded and handed him one of their other shields.
 It was not in great shape, but it was whole.
 Rodregas watched a few of the other matches before it was his turn again.
 Except for him, everyone remaining wore full plate.
 Rodregas’ next opponent was shining in the sun in his steel; which was better than him having to face Night Bronze plate, but still not very reassuring.
 The flag fell and Rodregas dug his heals into Doom Hoof’s side and the mount plodded forward.
 His opponent’s horse looked almost as powerful, but much faster.

Global Survey
 A survey of unemployment in different regions of the world makes evident the reason for the mounting concern over this issue.
 Unemployment in the industrial countries is at its highest level since the Great Depression.
 The official figure is around 6.4 per cent in the United States, but the actual number, including those who have given up seeking jobs, is probably above 10 per cent.
 More than 35 million Americans, constituting 14 per cent of the population, are living on incomes below the poverty line, including 30 per cent of all blacks and Hispanics.
 Western European unemployment rates are at the highest level in 30 years.
 They are projected soon to reach 12 per cent or 18 million people and remain high throughout the decade, prompting the outgoing European Union President, Jacques Delors, to call employment Europe’s ‘Achilles heel’.
 Youth unemployment rates (aged 16–19) in the European Community average nearly 20 per cent and nearly 50 per cent of the unemployment is long-term (more than one year).
 The emerging situation poses a challenge to the European concept of the welfare state.
 Employment in Eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union has been severely disrupted by the break-up of COMECON, the dissolution of the USSR and the movement of these countries from centrally planned to market economies.

The attacks started up a couple of months ago.
 They...remind me of a really terrible thing that happened, so when people make a big deal out of them it's like it's all happening again."
 Rachel nodded slowly, her wonderfully expressive face full of sympathy.
 "I'm sorry to have pried like that.
 If I'd known it would make you feel bad, I wouldn't have asked."
 I tried to shrug indifferently, but she seemed to see through my pretenses.
 "I normally wouldn't have said anything, but knowing what I know now, I wouldn't want you to go through the next several days hurting inside because you think everyone looking at you out of the corner of their eye is ridiculing you."
 Confident she didn't really need help, and eager to avoid further reminders of just how broken I was, I'd been standing to return to my desk.
 The words were plenty foreboding, but they had an impact all out of proportion from what they should have.
 I sank back into the chair and turned towards Rachel.

 Johnny – You’re more of an Idiot, house-boy.
 Eugene – It is a house damn it.
 Johnny – No it looks like a mountain.
 Eugene – Prove it!
 Johnny – Alright, let’s go get the letter!
 (Johnny and Gene exit from the stage still arguing about the letter)
 Jim – How long has that been going on?
 Liz – Since the letter came.

I could see it in his eyes.
 Funny how I'd never realized how expressive they were.
 "Don't lie to me."
 Alec sighed, and then shrugged.
 "I'm not sure what to tell you.
 There's so much you don't know, and most of it I can't tell you.
 More importantly, you're better off not knowing."
 I waited for several seconds, expecting him to go on, and then finally realized the matter was closed as far as he was concerned.
 "Hold on there.
 You can't just leave me in the dark about all of this.

So, he writes this piece of surrealistic poetry and he sings it, man, in this voice as old as the shepherds.
 Well, “Hell in Denmark” started that way.
 It’s code, man.
 But, you know, I don’t hide anything from my Love.
 I don’t know, I started out writing this song because I had fucked this chick, see, when I was on tour, when Lor was back here.
 And she sort of followed me around for a couple of gigs, and it was like a lost week, there, I was all screwed up.
 I wasn’t thinking about Lorelei or what this would mean to her, if anything.
 I just wanted to keep balling this chick, right?
 She was blond and willowy and looked like a pixie and I just couldn’t get enough of her.
 Some of my roadies, and Pete, man, God bless him, he was like ‘Buddy, drop this chick, she’s trouble, man.’  He was thinking of Lor.

In India irrigation accounts for 80 per cent of total water usage.
 A comparison of cotton cultivation under similar climatic conditions in California and South India, both utilizing extensive methods of irrigation, revealed that on average the Indian farmer consumes 35 times more water per unit of cotton produced than his counter-part in California.
 Water productivity can be enhanced by raising crop productivity as well as by adoption of deep chiselling technologies that enhance water retention in the soil.
 It can also be improved by shifting to more water efficient crops, such as replacing sugarcane wherever possible with sugar beet, which consumes 60 per cent less water per unit of sugar produced.
 Safety Nets: Long-term solution to the problem of food security requires efforts that will make people food self-sufficient.
 But until those efforts can be put in place and made effective, continued reliance will have to be placed on public programmes such as India’s highly successful Mid-Day Meal scheme for school children and Food for Work programs that combine employment and food security.
 The traditional concept of Food for Work needs to be enlarged to include skilled work related to human and social development.
 A Global Food Guarantee scheme should be put in place, which combines Food for Work and Employment Guarantee in a systematic manner.
 Human Development
 Development is a human process.

I suddenly knew that this dwarf was much braver than we had given him credit for.
 I suddenly felt awful because I knew who the thing was.
 Kojas.
 Chapter 7
 “The little traitor thought he could fool us,” Kojas announced, “but he was wrong.
 His death does not matter to me but what matters is what he could have said and done against us.
 He may have spilled too much.
 “But it does not matter!” he continued, his voice flowing with reassurance.
 “I have knowledge that the half-lings have entered our world and our grasp.
 The dwarf may have done us a favor, bringing them here, without knowing it.

There is a rumor that she might be an actual direct descendent of a God, though no one knew who that God might be.” “Really?
 That is rare if true.
 What is your gut instinct about her?” Rodregas asked.
 “Well, I am not sure if I am just doing the girl power together thing, but while she would not talk to me, I kind of like her.” Rodregas nodded, he had a similar impression.
 “Thank you for looking into their backgrounds, Imeralda.
 You should go get some sleep; the joust should be going on for hours.” She nodded as he got in the saddle.
 But before he could ride out she asked, “I don’t suppose you want to explain why you wanted to know about them?” “I am not sure, just thinking about options,” he answered.
 Then he pulled Doom Hoof through a wide turn and tried to get him moving and warmed up.
 If the beast felt any excitement or nervousness he was not showing it.
 Which Rodregas admitted was better than the opposite reaction.

It wasn’t hard to find because of its new size, but if I hadn’t been half expecting, half fearing the excessive growth, I might not have recognized it.
 Each of the strains I had grown the day Evelyn choked was flourishing.
 Noxious weeds were taking over the meadow.
 As I stood there, frozen before this changed garden, I was overwhelmed by the scene, overtaken by emotion, and had to press my eyes closed.
 Light rain began to fall and I raised my head to the sky, drawing in a deep breath.
 The cool water trickled down my face, calming the heat of my pulse.
 But it didn’t clear my head.
 I still couldn’t understand.
 A painful fear shot through me, and I tilted my head forward to run through the growth.
 Vines, thorns and leaves turned to muddy ash as they touched my outstretched arms, wet with rain.

“I guess not.” “Are you going to get mad at me?” I pouted.
 She play punched me in the arm.
 “No, I'll let it slide.” She winked at me.
 I looked over at Seth, trying to catch his eye but he avoided my gaze.
 Jason started talking to Seth and the two whispered so we couldn't hear.
 Emily rolled her eyes.
 “So did you find anything?” I asked and traced the dirt with my foot.
 Emily shook her head.
 “Nothing, we're alone.
 Maybe we can try to get somewhere without bad guys jumping out at us.” “We should move, before something does find us.

These real and significant gains have been offset and to a large extent obscured in our minds by the persistence and aggravation of problems that constitute the other side of the post-Cold War ledger.
 Far from vanishing, the nuclear danger has been aggravated by the continued proliferation of nuclear weapons, the increasing danger of these weapons falling into the hands of terrorists, and the stubborn refusal of the existing nuclear powers to seize the opportunity to totally eradicate this pernicious arsenal of self-annihilation.
 Reduced confrontation between nation states has been followed by an aggravation of internal conflicts within countries as well as a dramatic increase in threats of violence by disenchanted minorities.
 Violent local conflicts continue to flare around the world.
 Terrorist acts have intensified against civilian populations on every continent.
 While the worst fears about rising unemployment in the West have been dispelled, the challenge of generating sufficient employment opportunities for all people around the world remains a pressing concern.
 The rich-poor divide has increased within and between nations.
 Inadequate job/livelihood opportunities resulting in inadequate purchasing power have now become the most important cause of endemic and hidden hunger.
 Most regrettable has been the failure to enhance the powers and strengthen reliance on effective multilateral institutions.
 The emergence of the USA as the sole superpower has brought with it a reduction in the role and influence of the UN in international affairs, precisely at a time when the world should be striving to build a viable multilateral cooperative security system.

“How long was I out?” I asked, blushing brighter.
 Except I couldn’t pin down the reason why.
 Seth frowned, “I don’t know but it seemed like forever.
 You scared us, Jazell.” “Especially Seth,” Emily piped up behind him.
 “He was the one going crazy to bandage you and was worrying more than the rest of us.” Seth’s face reached a new undiscovered level of red, “I didn’t want to lose a friend.” “Right…” Emily trailed off and smirked at him, wiggling her eyebrows.
 Seth squirmed slightly and avoided her gaze.
 I started to laugh but in morphed into a cough instead.
 I clutched my midsection to find it was covered in bandages.
 “What exactly happened?” I questioned.
 Seth glanced at Emily and back at me, “I don’t really know.

“First of all, once you enter, there is a chance that you won’t be able to leave for a while.” My heart fell at this.
 “Second, Igneeria is wild and offers little protection.
 Especially at a time like this.” He gave us a hard stare.
 “You might get seriously injured, or you might almost die.
 You must be ready for this.” I felt my stomach do sick flip-flops.
 I wasn’t ready.
 “Anyway,” the dwarf said quickly, obviously seeing our surprised faces, “I think all of you can deal with that.
 Shall we go?” Seth shrugged, “I guess.
 The answer to that question doesn’t really matter.” The dwarf held his hand out, “Shall we go then?” I shrugged, “Lead the way, shorty.” The dwarf gave me an annoyed look and walked towards the arch.
 I expected him to go right through but he disappeared in a swirl of black mist.

"But I didn't get as many opportunities as I would have liked.
 Still, I love my father very much.

 Rick leaned forward to take her hands.
 "I'm sorry, honey.
 I know it's hard for you.
 But I bet you'll walk back into 1927 when you least expect it."
 That thought depressed him.

I thought for a moment that my knees were going to collapse on me.
 I carefully reached up and brushed the bandage on his shoulder.
 "They could've killed you?"
 Alec shrugged.
 "I came out okay all things considered."
 He was going to have to rethink this deflection thing, but now didn't seem like the time to get pushy.
 I forced a measure of gaiety into my voice and smiled up at him.
 "Well, I'm glad things turned out the way they did.
 Otherwise we'd both be dead."
 Alec flinched slightly, and then looked at the grotto.

I know, she said.
 I said, well, shit, you know, in the restaurant, I’m sorry, I didn’t remember who you were, and I thought, damn, this is embarrassing, but, I thought you were staring at me, you know, to get my attention, to get my heterosexual attention.
 And, well, then I remembered, of course, that I knew you through the Tickles.
 And she said, I wasn’t just looking at you because I expected you to remember me.
 You know, you’re not bad to look at.
 I could have looked all night, she said.
 Well, shit, I thought, ok, yeah.
 I can dig this chick, because I mean, she had this body, well, the kind you dream about.
 And she was this novelist’s daughter and so she was cool and kind of bohemian and had this apartment in Midtown, upper floor, with a nice view of Poplar.
 So, I just showed up there one evening.

What else did he know?
 What else could he be?
 He thought of Aurelia only once before he spoke.
 Her face was a white knife in the darkness of his mind, and he buried her deep within his heart as he yielded to the wisdom of his brother.
 “Yeah,” Harruq said.
 “I understand.”
 “Good.
 Now come.” The two resumed traveling up the small hill.
 They stopped again, however, for from their vantage point they could see the village.
 “See the torches?” Harruq asked, pointing.

"You fell asleep," he whispered, his face moving closer to hers.
 "Yes."
 "Me too."
 His lips brushed over hers.
 "Your lips are red from the sun."
 "Mmm."
 Her hand slid to the nape of his neck, gently pulling his head closer.
 He kissed her again, enjoying the sweet warmth of her lips, the eagerness of her response.
 He felt her slender fingers stroking his neck, and remembering how she'd run her hands over his chest yesterday evening, he wished he'd taken off his shirt.
 Marie sighed into Rick's mouth.

 No adult, no matter how many years older than me, could tell me I was wrong.
 I knew I was very much in love with Eric.
 I thought of marriage, and that was when I saw what Eric was.
 He was the wind.
 You can't tie the wind up and put it in a house and make it love you.
 How I wanted to be with him until we were so old and fragile that I would have broken had he put his arm around me.
 "Even though I never had that, we had something much finer.
 We went to the beach many times and talked until we were too hoarse to say anything.

They thought I'd been kidnapped at first, but when there was no ransom request, they were afraid I'd been murdered.

At least if Brandon's pack does come after us there, we're within our rights to do something about it."
 I opened my mouth to comment on the fact that Brandon's pack was roughly twice the size of ours, only to realize that scurrying back home kind of precluded continuing to help out at the tutor lab.
 "What about helping Mrs.
 Campbell?"
 It shouldn't have surprised me that Alec thought it over for several seconds before shaking his head.
 Whatever else he was, he wasn't the thoughtless jerk Brandon had proven himself to be.
 "I'm sorry, Adriana.
 I wish we could, for Rachel's sake as well as yours, but it's just too risky.
 Fewer witnesses means more chance Brandon's people will try to arrange for something to happen.
 There are just too many of them for us to meet them in a stand-up fight and come out unscathed."

 Anyway, Lor knows all this—it’s cool, it’s cool.

 I mean, it hurt her, yeah, she’s human.
 But, she knew I wouldn’t do anything like this lightly.

Brandon's gray eyes twinkled as he made a show of checking me over.
 "Looks like you're not sick."
 I didn't know it was possible to blush and smile at the same time.
 "Nope, not sick."
 After such a beginning, my day could hardly be anything but great.
 One class after another rolled by, and all of the things that normally would've bothered me just went whipping past without managing to stick.
 I couldn't remember the second phase of cell division in Biology.
 I'd forgotten to reread the last chapter of Wuthering Heights, and Britney went out of her way to snub me.
 The only thing I cared about was making it to lunch so I could see Brandon again.
 I dawdled on my way to Algebra, so much so I was nearly late for class.

The bitter taste of fear along the back of my tongue was surprisingly strong, but even so I found my thoughts dwelling on the sheer pleasure of having my arms wrapped around Alec's rock-hard upper body.
 The high-pitched scream of a performance engine pulled me away from my absurd musings.
 James' blue and white Accord passed us doing the better part of twice the legal speed limit, and then flipped around with the distinctive squeal of overworked tires.
 Alec veered up onto the road as I looked back to find that even as fast as he was running, the Accord was still gaining on us at a prodigious rate.
 As the car pulled even with us, Alec smoothly reached over, pulled the passenger door open, pried me off of his back, and slid me into the front seat without losing even a single step.
 If everything had happened at something approaching normal speed, I probably would've started hyperventilating, but it was all so quick my mind didn't have a chance to fully register what was going on before I was safely ensconced next to James.
 Jasmin and Isaac appeared alongside the road, materializing where there'd only been trees a half-second before.
 Faster than I would have believed possible, all three of the shape shifters piled into the moving car, and then James stomped on the gas hard enough to break triple digits before slowing slightly for the first turn.
 The mirror on my side of the car was perfectly positioned for me to be able to see three or four flashes of tawny brown sliding through the trees before the winding road carried us out of sight.
 Alec nodded as I looked back and met his eyes.

“Shut up and start telling me more about yourself.”

“It will pass.” I hoped she was right.
 Chevelle was watching me, anxious now.
 “Is everyone all right?” I asked.
 My throat was raw, my voice sounded as if it had been through a grater.
 “Are you?” he replied in a low tone.
 I couldn’t be sure.
 He hesitated, almost not wanting to ask the question he knew he must.
 “Can you tell me your name?” “Elfreda,” I answered immediately.
 He waited for the rest.
 But I had two answers, didn’t I?

 I just couldn't let you go after her."
 The immediate crisis past, I could have lost myself looking at his features, but a slow smile suddenly reminded me of the only other person I knew that could pack so much pain in such a simple gesture.
 "What about Rachel, Alec?
 Where is she?"
 I hadn't thought his expression could become anymore bittersweet.
 I was wrong.
 "Rachel doesn't have anyone either, but she's still suffering from a deeper hurt.

Of course, Rachel was so inherently good, and Brandon was so reasonable about everything.
 If I could get the pair of them to spend some time together it would probably go a long ways towards patching up the stupid feud Alec seemed so determined to keep alive.
 I thought about broaching the idea with Rachel, but discarded the notion immediately.
 She would just clam up, just like she always did whenever anything relating to her brother was mentioned.
 I'd have to be sneaky to get the two of them together.
 Mrs. Campbell needed a little bit of reassuring when she stopped by my desk, which I did happily now that my personal universe was looking up once again, and then I dug into my homework with near-normal gusto.
 Time flew by all too quickly.
 Soon it was just me holding down the fort and trying to take care of a trio of freshmen girls who seemed to be at least slightly ahead of the normal cramming curve.
 I was glad they weren't waiting until the day before the test to come in for help, but it was looking like tomorrow wasn't going to be any fun.
 Maybe I'd get lucky again, and most of the lazy ones would give up before my shift started.

It was a small snake, its white belly confirming it was nonvenomous, its frame no thicker than my pinkie, but it would do.
 I slid the tip of the sword across the skin above the man’s knee, making a narrow incision.
 His expression did change then, giving way to uncertainty.
 I smiled at him as the sword tip rested against his leg.
 In measured movements, I placed the snake on the base of the blade, letting it slide toward its mark.
 I closed my eyes to relax, settle into the snake as I had the bird.
 My knees buckled as I released too much and I had to back off, giving myself just enough to control it.
 As it entered the wound, the tracker gasped and my smile stretched wickedly.
 I wormed my way blindly up his leg, intent on getting the information I needed.
 They’re getting closer.

It smacked the dirt an inch from Antonil’s foot.
 Sergan shook his head and stared in wonder at his commander.
 The man had not flinched.
 “I shall take that as your answer,” Antonil shouted to the town.
 “Woodhaven desires death.”
 He drew his sword and spoke softly.
 “So be it.”
 Elves appeared in the windows of every building that lined the center.
 Full quivers hung from their backs.
 Sixty more elves joined their lone companion on the street and readied their bows.

 An apparition swirled before him, blacker than the shadows, red eyes smoldering.
 Its rank claws touched his face, turning the sweat on his brow to ice.
 The arrow squirmed deeper.
 Qurrah focused every bit of his will upon it, desperately seeking to repulse it.
 His well of energy, which he’d thought empty, burgeoned and over-flowed.
 The arrow snapped, banishing the necromancer’s presence, but leaving a solitary impression squatting at the back of Qurrah’s mind:

 But, I didn’t know who she was until I was inside her and she was moving like God’s immaculate machine.
 Damn, she could ball.
 And, I was, I thought, in love, for only the really second time in my life.
 I wasn’t thinking, like, I gotta leave Lor, it’s gonna be painful, I want to be with this woman, this white light.
 I wasn’t thinking, period.
 Anyway, Lor knows all this—it’s cool, it’s cool.
 Lorelei, you gotta understand, is amazing, she’s like so together, and she understands human nature and sees it for the shoddy stuff that it is, and she accepts everything, man, like all human interaction is innocent, you dig?
 I mean, it hurt her, yeah, she’s human.
 But, she knew I wouldn’t do anything like this lightly.

I stood there woodenly for several seconds, unsure whether or not she was through.
 She finally made a shooing motion and turned back to grading papers.
 Predictably, there were still a half-dozen other kids in the classroom.
 They all turned back to the door and started filing out again, but by tomorrow half the school would know exactly how badly I'd just been humiliated.
 I found myself just outside the tutor lab with no recollection of having stumbled to my locker, or going by Physics to grab the stuff I'd left there.
 Still, somehow my Spanish book had disappeared, replaced by my math book.
 My knees started shaking as I entered the room, but I made it safely to my normal table before they gave out.
 "Adri, Adriana?
 Excuse me."
 I didn't recognize the girl standing across from me, but based on her uncomfortable expression and the fact that more than one person had turned for the sole purpose of watching us out of the corner of their eyes, she'd been standing there longer than I'd realized.

 Horror.
 “I do what I have to do,” he said again.
 But did the villagers have to die?
 All those children, mothers, sisters, fathers…‌nothing but a test.
 And all those small bodies he left for his brother to mutilate?
 What was it his swords were accomplishing?
 Every action, every kill, seemed to confirm the words of his brother.
 He was a killer and nothing more.
 His legacy would be one of death and emptiness.

 There was a story there, but I wasn't about to ask now and expose myself to further ridicule.
 Britney was oddly quiet as we entered the lunch room.
 I was a little hungry, but the pangs were a distant kind of discomfort.
 The real suffering for not eating wouldn't come into play until we hit the tutoring lab.
 Oh well, when I got home ravenous and ate a decent-sized meal Mom would probably be ecstatic.
 Or too wrapped up in some project to even notice.
 It was hard enough anticipating what I was going to do from day to day.
 Trying to figure Mom out was truly futile.

He finally shrugged and wrote his name on the scroll in front of him.
 Rodregas’ heart froze as the sorcerer stood and strode over to the table.
 He reached out and casually touched the shoulder of the Knight Captain.
 “Captain Intreg, do you mind asking a few questions to confirm his status?” The Knight seemed uncomfortable under the hand of the sorcerer but nodded and said to Rodregas, “What is the eighth law of Chivalry?” “Thou shalt never offer combat to someone who is not equal in strength, unless in defense of the honor of the Order, for Justice for the oppressed or in defense of the weak,” he answered.
 Captain Intreg nodded and then asked, “A question of law: two messenger couriers stop at a keep with priority messages and switch out horses.
 The local lord finds that both horses are lame and are no longer any good.
 One of the messengers is from a neighboring lord and one from the Guild of the Celestial Path.
 What rights does the lord have in this situation?” Rodregas noticed the sorcerer seemed to stiffen at the question.
 Rodregas’ mind swirled.
 The first questions had been easy, but it had been a very long time since he had studied law.

 And the music, each note contained all kinds of harmonies, all at once.
 And the instruments sounded like giant bells, big as mountains, far away.” Eric had sat up.
 His eyes bored into mine.
 “Were you scared?
 What’s it feel like there?” “You know when you’re away from home and no matter how great a time you’re having, you’re still a bit uneasy, so when you get home you always feel relieved?
 You unwind, your heart slows.
 Nothing can hurt you now.
 That’s how it felt.” “You’re a lucky guy,” Eric said, in a more wistful tone than I had ever heard him use.

Then came the fire, erupting as if those fingers were a crack releasing the melted rock of the abyss.
 The sudden light blinded them both.
 The fire burned through the orcs as a solid beam, melting their bodies and scattering their remains.
 When it struck the wooden gate, it exploded.
 Wood shattered.
 Guards behind the gate howled as molten rock struck them, piercing through their shields and armor.
 The orcs roared at the sight, not at all upset at their own losses.
 The way into the city was clear.
 Axes and swords held high, they rushed the opening.
 “A minor skirmish,” Qurrah chuckled, echoing the elf’s words.

At the same time there are a number of positive factors that offer opportunities to increase productivity significantly in the near to middle term.
 Closing the productivity gap
 A survey comparing the levels of productivity for major crops between countries reveals a wide disparity between proven technological potentials and actual field results for every crop.
 Cereal yields in Western Europe and North America average 4.5 tons per hectare, compared to three tons in Asia, 2.3 tons in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, two tons in Latin America and slightly more than one ton in Africa.
 The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) projects a 40 per cent increase in wheat yields in 92 developing countries, excluding China, by 2010.
 In rice, countries with widely differing climatic conditions, such as Australia, Korea, Egypt, Spain, Japan and Italy, achieve average yields nearly double the world average and two to three times the yields achieved in countries such as India, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.
 Total rice yields in 92 developing countries are expected to rise to 37 per cent by 2010.
 Maize yields in Greece, Chile, Austria, Italy and Germany average more than double the world average, and five to six times the averages achieved in large maize-producing countries such as India.
 Even comparing areas under irrigated maize, average yields range from 1.5 to 8.4 tons per hectare.
 New varieties of maize are under development that yield 30 per cent more grain in a drought season than conventional varieties.

While Doi’van had seen a lion’s head on another man-like shape in the distance, and of course Doi’van’s dragon had a lion’s head, he felt drawn to this shape.
 While he was not as attracted as he had felt with the Celestial Lion, he guessed that this was as good a match as he would find among the Infernal Daemons.
 Rodregas looked back toward Doi’van, but could no longer see him.
 He knew he should check on him and Imeralda, but he also knew that they had all chosen to walk this path.
 It had ended up being a more interesting path than expected, but they all wanted to see where it went.
 He reached up and petted the powerful black head of the creature.
 Its ears had the only hint of non-black on the beast, a slight touch of silver.
 The fur was not as soft as it looked and was actually rough to the touch.
 Rodregas realized his hand was sinking into the skin.
 He tried to pull back but felt himself being drawn into it.

He could see the tips of their arrows sticking out, glinting in torchlight.
 Two adjacent homes were already ablaze, their occupants still inside.
 Qurrah turned and grabbed the frame of the door.
 “Burn!” he shouted, loud enough for the elves to hear.
 The wood blackened, smoke billowed from his hands, and then the entire building erupted as if bathed in oil.
 Qurrah laughed, untouched by the heat.
 He could not say the same for the elves, and as their pained screams reached his ears he only laughed louder.
 The half-orc ran as people flooded the streets, calling out for buckets and water.
 Too many homes were aflame.
 They could no longer cower within them and hope to be spared.

“Where’s the dwarf?” she asked quickly.
 “Climbing the slide.
 Weird huh?” I almost tripped but I caught myself.
 She pushed us into the woods, “We got to move fast before someone gets hurt.
 Make sure no one is around.” In a matter of seconds, I had an arrow in my bow, Seth had his sword in his hand and Jason had his hands full of knives.
 The dwarf was sitting on the edge of the slide, looking like an ugly version of a toddler, and a few more came out of the woods to join him.
 We tried to sneak up without being spotted but one of the dwarves turned his head and saw us.
 He immediately launched himself onto Emily.
 She screeched and I thought I saw one of the kids turn around.
 He crawled up to her ear and whispered something that I couldn’t hear.

When I devoured the first piece, he laughed and threw me another.
 I hoped I looked appropriately abashed.
 As I finished the second serving, he stepped closer to sit on the misshapen rock that rose through the earth beside me.
 He held his hand wide and a canteen flew up from a pile of things on the other side of the fire.
 He passed it to me, and I tilted it back, expecting cool water.
 I almost choked when warm wine hit my throat.
 He leaned forward to get a better look at me as I lowered the container.
 He looked as if he thought I might spook, otherwise I guessed he had plenty to say hidden beneath that smirk.
 It didn’t stop him from moving uncomfortably close, though, or eyeing me with what I was certain was the same look I’d just given my meal.
 I cleared my throat, thinking I’d made my sense of discomfort clear when he started to move, but he only stood, which brought him even closer.

He started rambling something about how I didn’t like him or respect him and I quickly claimed I did.
 I was a lanky fifteen year old, probably about 5’8’, 140 pounds.
 He stepped towards me as I obeyed his wish for me to come to him.
 He hit me so fast I didn’t see it coming, and I flew backwards onto the desktop.
 All four legs of the desk broke beneath the impact of my body.
 I lay there stunned on my back.
 As Dino walked towards me I could see the crowd of guests rushing in behind him.
 He straddled me and I gathered my legs towards my chest with my arms crossed in front of my face to protect myself.
 He looked like a killer standing over me, his eyes big, his teeth gritted and his right fist well above his head poised to pound me again.
 I straightened my right leg out as a kick upward directly into his crotch as hard and fast as I could.

Rodregas had known that fact, but had not really thought about it.
 “So what you are saying is that Imeralda forms a life bond like a AElf.
 But while a normal AElf has only one she can form multiple bonds, and she has a bond with you and a bond with me?” he asked.
 “Yes, I know of few other cases like this.
 She will always know where you are.
 And my guess is if you are open to the bond, you will be able to know where she is.
 But, there are also deeper implications.
 The mating bond is one of the great sources of power for the AElf peoples,” he said.
 Rodregas did not understand fully what Jordaan meant but he suddenly added, “Then, if Imeralda is bonded to me, she will always try to keep her connection with me?” He asked a question, but he thought he already knew the answer.
 Jordaan nodded.

In 1993, the average market price of the debt was about 30 cents on the dollar.
 This market discount was a major factor in the decision to scale down the debt of Latin American countries by an average of 15 per cent and of Egypt and Poland by 50 per cent.
 The aggregate debt of the 61 debt-affected countries with low and lower-middle income is roughly equal to that of the half-dozen mostly middle-income countries assisted under the Brady Plan.
 Scaling down the debt of these poor countries by an average of 70 per cent would be appropriate in view of their economic plight, though the actual reduction would have to be negotiated on a case by case basis.
 In order to be of sufficient magnitude, debt reduction should be applied to all three major classes of creditors: bilateral official creditors, private sector lenders and international organizations.
 Debt reduction should be linked to each country's specific programmes for poverty eradication and meeting the minimum needs of the people.
 7.Commodity prices: The problem of debt is closely linked to that of international commodity prices.
 The majority of developing countries are dependent on the export of primary products for their welfare and growth.
 These products account for 80–90 per cent of the exports of African countries, and 65 per cent in the case of Latin American nations.
 The extreme price volatility of commodity markets is especially damaging to low-income countries, which, regardless of the price, are forced to sell their products to meet minimum needs and pay debts.

Chevelle moved to stand beside me, he too intent.
 Grey wagged his eyebrows at Steed, taunting him to make the first move.
 “Come on, blossom,” Steed teased back, “let’s see what you’ve got.” At that, Grey disappeared and then, in a flash, was behind Steed, reaching up to smack him in the back of the head.
 The instant before he struck, Steed ducked into a squat and spun, taking Grey’s legs out from under him.
 I flinched.
 Grey was gone again, this time reappearing midair in a flip above Steed’s head, reaching down to tag him on the way by.
 It was a loud smack.
 I was sure it had stung.
 Steed stood still, focused on the spot where Grey had landed and was flickering in and out of view.
 I made an effort to consider possible responses in my head, but was coming up blank.

Can we foster love of diversity and pluralism in terms of religion, race, language, colour or political belief?
 In our view, there are uncommon opportunities now to find the solutions to these basic challenges facing contemporary human society.
 We have tried to deal with them in a concise manner in this report, which concludes that commitment to the principles of democracy and human diversity, equity in terms of gender, economic condition and sustainable lifestyles, is fundamental to achieving both a better common present and a better future.
 Personally, it has been a privilege working with a highly distinguished group of women and men, whose sole concern has been a better life for all.
 I wish to thank every member of the Commission, as well as the many others who have helped us, for their time and vision.
 The Member Secretary, Mr Garry Jacobs, however, merits a special mention for his total dedication to the principles which inspired the setting up of ICPF.
 Throughout the last five years, he has devoted his time and extraordinary talent to the work of the Commission.
 He has been the principal catalyst of the Commission's work.
 In his heavy responsibilities, he has been ably supported by Robert J. Macfarlane and Robert van Harten.
 I wish to record our sincere gratitude to this unique trio.

'Cool' people don't sweat tardiness and Britney really wanted to be cool.
 A slender, frumpy-looking woman looked up from her desk as Britney and I walked in.
 I held up my form, which she took without reading it.
 "No doubt something to ensure I know you're my newest student.
 Sit over there where you won't distract Britney from just how poorly she's doing in my class.
 There's an extra book on the shelves in the back."
 Britney rolled her eyes as she went to her assigned desk, but I suspected she was actually relieved we'd been split up.
 Mrs. Campbell didn't seem like the kind of teacher you could get away with ignoring, so I retrieved an algebra book from the back of the room and sat at my desk.
 Any thoughts about finding out why hiking was off limits quickly melted away once class started.
 Math had never been my favorite subject.

We attacked them with a pool, and they threw water balloons at us while we were on bikes.
 It was pretty simple, but the whole time all I noticed was Seth.
 He wasn’t the same to me anymore; he always had this mask on his face, hiding himself from the rest of us.
 I had to find out what was wrong, and soon.
 “Jazell, are you paying attention?” Emily’s annoyed voice broke my day dreams.
 I snapped back to attention, “Uh yes, I am Emily.
 Just for the record, what are we talking about?” “Jazell you’re hopeless!
 We’re talking about what to do next,” she scowled.
 “Wait,” an idea jumped into my head, “how about we meet under a truce.” Emily stared at me.
 “A truce?

I think it was really starting to sink in that she wasn't going to be able to get out of continuing to spend most of her afternoons here.
 Albert, Mrs. Campbell, and the other tutor all waved goodbye as they left.
 One of the cheerleaders, a particularly whiny specimen named Jackie, wanted help, which I was happy to offer, even in my current state.
 Unfortunately she thought that meant I'd just hand over all the answers.
 We spent a good ten minutes with her trying to offer a variety of covert bribes ranging from the insignificant to things she couldn't possibly deliver.
 I kept telling her I wasn't interested and that she'd just have to do the work.
 Surprisingly enough, once she accepted that, she actually buckled down.
 It only took another ten minutes to explain the Pythagorean theory to her.
 By the time I stood up from Jackie's desk, there were only four of us left.
 Britney was staring sullenly at her book.

A Thrasher pack had at least six or seven but there must have been more than ten monsters total.
 It was scary.
 Right then, right at that very moment, I knew something was terribly wrong.
 They all stopped in front of us, all those pairs of angry eyes staring at us.
 They made me confused, from the warm feeling the Frost Beasts gave me to the cold feeling the Thrashers inflicted.
 They exchanged some sort of signal, including grunts and yips, and slowly advanced on us.
 The dogs stalked toward the four of us looking like a animals about to attack their prey.
 The cute look was gone and all that was left was hunger.
 The dog nearest to me jumped at my chest and landed on my stomach.
 I managed to push it down before it breathed on me.

God is me, in me, you know?
 That’s what she’s saying.
 That’s what she’s always been saying, but people couldn’t hear her, for whatever reason.
 They wouldn’t listen.
 Just like I say in “Burn my Bridge”, you know?
 “There’s a black and white photograph/On my finger is a tiny bird.”  You know?
 It’s like they can’t hear me now, after they all were so intent on being Black Lung acolytes, or whatever.
 Now, these same cats, these same sycophants and hangers-on, they’re up there, pronouncing on me, on Lor, on my new stuff as if I’m not a human being, too.
 As if I can’t be hurt, am impregnable, a force instead of a feeling, bleeding child, you know?
 Like we all are.

Growing environmental concerns in the West have generated pressure for reducing fertilizer consumption in developing countries, when in most instances fertilizer application levels are lower than those in Western Europe by a factor of five or ten times.
 Increased, rather than reduced, use of chemical fertilizers will be essential to the expansion of agriculture in these countries and can considerably increase crop yields.
 Total fertilizer consumption by developing countries is expected to double by 2010.
 Furthermore, replacing macro-nutrients lost during intensive cultivation does not compensate for the depletion of more than a dozen micro-nutrients that also determine the quantity and quality of crops.
 Even in such agriculturally diverse countries as the United States and India, it has been demonstrated that better management of micro-nutrients can raise productivity substantially – in some intensively cultivated areas by as much as 50 to 100 per cent or more in a wide variety of crops – without significant changes in the structure or method of cultivation.
 Greater attention is needed to conserving and applying organic sources of manure and raising nitrogen-fixing crops, as well as to the use of bio-fertilizers.
 Unlike the creation of new irrigated lands, the application of such environmentally sustainable field practices is neither very costly nor technology-intensive, and can be widely propagated through improvements in agricultural training and extension.
 Increasing exports
 Over the next six years, the agreements reached during the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations are expected to reduce the tariffs levied by the industrial nations on agricultural products by 37 per cent and on tropical food exports by 43 per cent.
 Developing countries will cut agricultural tariffs by an average of 24 per cent.

Taiga’s manner continued to be friendly but inquisitive.
 The conversation started with a polite discussion on new spells that Van’dret was working on, and then moved to his thoughts on the recent political and economic tensions with the Romig Empire.
 Wine and food appeared on the table; Van’dret never saw it come, or the empty plates go.
 It simply was.
 The food, like everything in the tower, was of the finest quality.
 They were fed incredible grilled silver salmon, greens from the Northern Kingdoms, and small pastries from the Korin Islands.
 Taiga seemed in no hurry to get to any point, Immortalist had nothing, if not time.
 Finally, Taiga brought up the point that Van’dret believed had gained him the honor of joining Taiga in his solar.
 “So I understand that you are to journey to the Cathedral of the Heavens for this year’s open tourney?” Taiga asked his voice as melodic as one would expect from an elf, but just a tad deeper than one would think.
 “Yes, my lord, I leave in the morning,” Van’dret replied.

 Hours later, they finished and said their goodbyes.
 “See you tomorrow,” Harruq called, sheathing his blades.
 The elf did not reply as she vanished behind the trees.
 He stared after her for a bit, then turned toward home.
 Before he could take two steps, a sudden weight crashed into his side.
 He tumbled best he could, his shoulder absorbing much of the impact.
 His legs tucked underneath him and pushed, shooting him back to his feet.
 Out came his swords.
 Standing before him was Dieredon, his bow held in both hands like a staff.

He flipped onto his stomach, closing his eyes in anticipation.
 Ahhh.
 Those soft, slender hands imitated what she'd felt him do to her, rubbing and caressing.
 He only wished he could get her to do his chest as well so that he could gaze up at her as she ran her hands over him.
 Marie liked touching him.
 He was big and muscular, and she'd thought that just looking at him without his shirt was a great pleasure.
 But that was before she'd gotten to run her hands over him.
 After a few minutes she stopped and lay down with a sigh.
 The beach was beautiful, and the air smelled so good.
 She liked being here with Rick.

“Here Jazell, use this to keep your hair out of your face,” she opened her hand and dropped something in my palm.
 I held it up.
 It was a thin, vine that was about a foot long.
 It felt like a ribbon to me and I shrugged.
 I don't usually wear ribbons and bows; that was Emily's style.
 I pulled my hair back and tied the vine.
 It kept my hair out of my face and acted like a rubber band.
 “Thanks Emily,” I said.
 She finished tying her hair back.
 “No problem.

When she looked up, she smiled nervously.
 She had no family present.
 She told everyone how her mother told her how ugly she was her whole life and told her she was worthless, how she attempted to numb the pain with the drugs she took.
 How she became addicted to the drugs, and prostituted herself to pay for her habit.
 She said that she took all the drugs she could because she knew she would never be alive to see her twenty-first birthday.
 She smiled and announced that she was now twenty-one.
 She thanked one staff member after another and one student after another, each for something specific they had contributed to her healing.
 She said she now felt worthwhile, beautiful and confident.
 She had learned how to manage the demons in her head.
 She was beautiful and it shocked me that she had ever considered anything else and to the point that she tried to destroy herself.

They establish orderly and peaceful processes for conflict resolution within society.
 In addition, elected governments find it extremely difficult to win public support for initiating and sustaining wars in which the country’s own citizenry must fight, except in order to rebuff or forestall external aggression, as illustrated by domestic opposition to America’s role in Vietnam.
 War is the engine of dictatorial power.
 Peace is the social dividend of democracy.
 Peace is not merely the absence of war.
 It is a settled, stable, secure condition which thrives on a foundation of political maturity, social freedom and economic well-being.
 A world in which all major military powers – with the present exclusion of China – have democratic governments removes the ideological basis and political pressure for confrontation between states.
 If it is maintained, the adoption of democratic forms of government by the nations of Eastern Europe and the developing world will help ensure peaceful relations between states, which is the most fundamental precondition for accelerated economic development.
 The marriage of democracy and disarmament can transform the world – abolishing wars, eliminating nuclear arsenals, liberating hundreds of billions of dollars for building a better common future.
 In economic terms, the shift to democratic government presents an opportunity for more rapid development in these countries.

 queen.
 But she was back now.
 Davis was her fiancé, and she had no business kissing Rick, no business sitting in his kitchen in nothing but his pajama top.
 Reddening, Marie set her glass down and headed for the stairs.
 “I’m going to take a shower.” She couldn’t believe what she’d done.
 She could almost excuse herself for kissing Rick in Hollywood, say that he’d been part of the dream.

I remember he would carry a rare $1000 bill and attempt to pay his bill with it to shock the waiters, who would say, “We can’t change that!” My mom was wearing fur coats and new jewelry all the time.
 Dino was “in the import-export” business; we would later find out that he was involved in a criminal enterprise and during this time was smuggling diamonds.
 It was not unusual for Dino’s associates to come to the house with weapons inside their jackets.
 When they played poker, stacks of hundred dollar bills spilled across the table, and one of the requirements to sit at the table was to put your gun in a pile of weapons across the room.
 I guess they didn’t want the loser to play his trump card with a pistol!
 My brother and I hustled drinks for them for small tips.
 After we were told to go to bed, we would hide behind the counter that blocked the table where they played cards.
 We could stay there late into the night and hear details of these shady lives.
 They all had odd nicknames.
 One man was called “The Painter” and I have no idea where the name came from but I did know that if they needed someone’s house “painted” that this man was going there to kill them.

Imeralda followed him as did all the squire’s attendants.
 It was time for the final match.
 Rodregas left his shield and mace relaxed at his side and strode over to Nordien, who stood with shield and mace at the ready.
 Instead of attacking he asked the big man, “So, are people right, do you plan to serve the Immortalists if you gain the greater sigil?” The squire looked around a little confused.
 He was clearly not expecting a conversation, but no one was near enough to hear.
 “The Immortalists are the true power of the realm.
 To tie ones self to them is only smart,” Nordien responded.
 “So, you do not deny it,” said Rodregas.
 “It is not to a squire that I am going to either admit or deny such claims.
 Now fight me.” His voice was smooth, but the end was more a growl than anything.

He reached out and took my hand in his, his fingers gentle as he turned it palm up to place a pebble there.
 “Can you do anything with this?” “No.” Frustration was clear in my voice.
 I had already tried.
 “And no fire?” “No.” “So nothing works?” The implication was there, but I didn’t know what it meant right away.
 And then it occurred to me.
 The horse.
 I had thought he had shown up because I’d impressed upon him to follow before I blacked out, but I had already been bound again at that point.
 Should I tell Chevelle?
 I didn’t know why I felt so protective of this secret.
 Chevelle drew a section of moss from one of the stones on the wall and it replaced the pebble.

Mortals, to a greater or lesser extent; have an ability to tap into the mana that has overflowed into our realm from the Celestial, Infernal and Elemental Realms.
 I, for one, believe that if our connections to these realms were cut,” Jordaan made a motion like knife cutting a loaf of bread, “that in a few years there would not be enough magic for us to use.” “Luckily, I can think of no way for such a thing to happen.
 But a mortal’s ability to use mana that has spilled into the mortal world is very limited.
 The Immortalists have overcome this limitation by incorporating certain people’s direct connection to these realms.
 “So,” Jordaan continued, “if a mortal can add a Celestial’s ability to directly tap the Celestial power, he becomes far stronger.
 If the magic user can also tap into the Elemental powers, he again becomes far more powerful.
 Of course, the end goal of the Immortalists is to become a god.
 There are limitations; if an Immortalist were to incorporate a celestial ant’s connection to the Celestial, he would gain in power.
 But if he were to try to incorporate a thousand ants, he would only gain the same connection as that single ant.
 So instead he might try a butterfly to gain the power of its greater life essence.” At this point Jordaan paused and he went from an expression of lecturing to one of fearfulness.

The squire who claimed that shield and made it to the Cathedral’s main hall with it would be knighted on the spot by the Knight Commander of the Order.
 This day would decide Rodregas’ fate.
 It was likely to end in defeat.
 He stood flexing his sore shoulders, waiting for the flag to drop.
 Across from him was Geriodon who was standing tall and ready in his Night Bronze armor.
 He looked to have gotten much more sleep than Rodregas, and of course, now he also had a minor Sigil of Healing.
 So what little advantage Rodregas might have had was no longer.
 Directly to Rodregas’ left stood the tall graceful figure of Nordien, he was as tall as Rodregas if not quite as muscular and his armor was spectacular.
 Geriodon had a full suit of Night Bronze armor which was plain and serviceable looking.
 Nordien’s armor was a work of art.

I was too detached to care.
 The knock on the door at least brought me back to myself enough to wonder how long I'd been on the floor.
 My ankle hurt so bad, it was all I could do to get myself standing and then hobble the fifteen feet to the door.
 When I finally managed to get the door open and found empty space where there should have been a person, I almost swore.
 Then I saw the incredibly beautiful rose on our porch.
 I picked it up, trimmed the bottom inch or so off with a knife, and got it into some water acting out of nothing more than pure habit.
 Dad had always kept at least a pair of rose bushes alive.
 He'd loved nothing more than giving Mom roses.
 Once I'd safely done my part to help prolong the future life of the gorgeous specimen, I got down to really examining it.
 I was far from an expert on roses, but I'd looked through pictures of hundreds of different kinds of tea roses, and never seen anything quite like this one.

Ravenhurr had a suit of Mithril chain; he could feel his heart start to beat in excitement.
 Mithril, a rare magical metal that was stronger than steel but much less heavy and made one of the best light armors.
 AElves, who are not physically as strong as other people, loved the metal.
 Rodregas held it up to himself and then, as excited as he had become, his heart sank as he realized that the suit was both too short and much too slim for him to wear.
 While there were straps to adjust it, his new body was very large and he would never wear the beautiful armor.
 He threw the armor on the bed.
 It might not work for him to wear, but he could get a good amount of money selling such fancy armor.
 It was the first item of real worth that he had found.
 On a shelf above it was another small pile of the silver chain.
 When he pulled it up he saw that it was a helmet, a solid Mithril skullcap with sides of chain mail designed to be connected at the bottom.

Jim – You got his hair perfect, but I don’t think he’d stoop to something that low-tech and effective, knowing Gene, he’d probably build a catapult and try to coax the elephant onto it, and then see how far an elephant can fly when it’s launched through the air by a weapon of war.
 Liz – Also knowing Gene, he’d build the catapult way too small, or he would launch himself on accident, but with his luck he wouldn’t die.
 The poor old lady that he’d land on would break his fall.
 But what Gene would try to do in real life doesn’t really matter, as that drawing isn’t literal.

 It’s just seems so cheerful and happy, it really cheers me up.

I was wrestling with these things, absurd things, but I couldn’t see clearly.
 All I saw was blackness, the blackness of dried blood.
 I don’t know what Crafty and Skippy thought—I didn’t even leave them a note.
 I feel bad about it now—and this, finally, I think, was what pissed Crafty off and led him to hire a lawyer for himself, to try and, you know, basically, steal my material.
 It was like, if you’re not gonna represent yourself well, we’re gonna take away your soul, all your work, all your history.
 Shit.
 That shark he hired---what a bastard.
 But, I was oblivious at the time.
 God bless Pete.

 I quietly entered the house, hoping to slip right into my room, but there she was, smack in the center of the sitting area, drunk as a two-day jamboree.
 She stopped me on my way through and forced me to sit, her audience.
 I watched her as she rambled.
 She had the same dull blonde hair and muddy-brown eyes as me, though my eyes were specked with green.
 After a long evening ducking her verbal jabs and listening to her theories on the Council’s secret conspiracies, I finally made it to my room.
 A flick of my fingers and light flooded the tiny space.
 I took a quick inventory: the seal on my wardrobe was intact, my drawings were still scattered across the floor, and the stash of cheese remained on the table beside my bed.
 My mother’s pendant hung from a woven leather chain above my pillow, shooting refracted beams across the bed, and I smiled as I sat beneath it.
 Scanning the pages I’d brought home from the library, I tried to find some order.

Their skin was shriveled and grey, and hung off their bodies like cold clothing.
 Their eyes were a bright yellow that matching their teeth and their fingers looked like gnarly old trees.
 And the smell; it was awful.
 They grabbed my feet, back and tugged at my hair.
 “Why does everything always happen to me?” I complained.
 No one heard me.
 The ugly creatures continued tugging at me like annoying two year old, which made me get really annoyed.
 “Get off me ugly looking toad dwarfs.
 Hey, that’s what I’ll call you, toad dwarfs.” I smiled at my quick thinking.
 I could be clever sometimes.

Were you dreaming?” I asked.
 He shook his head.
 “Just a bunch of nonsense I don't even remember.
 Why, did you get another vision?” “Yes,” I said.
 “It was with the same voice that was in my last dream.
 Only this time, I talked to the ghost girl.” “You did?
 What did she say?” “She hinted that she knew who made us this way and who attacked us that day,” I said.
 “She also said that Kojas would use our emotions against us and try to get us to come to him.” Something dark crossed Seth's face.
 “She also said that we were chosen because of our strong bond, but she said, not to test it,” I continued.
 “She also told me not to go into the shadows.” Seth stretched.

While his upper body was covered, nothing stopped the arrow from flying underneath and piercing through the metal greaves protecting his shins.
 Antonil stumbled, pain flaring up his right leg.
 He forced himself to continue running.
 If he could close the gap, the bow would prove no match for his longsword.
 Another arrow struck an inch from his left foot.
 His leg was aflame, yet he continued to charge, pulling back his shield so his sword could lash out.
 But the elf was not close enough, and he was more skilled with a bow than in just firing arrows.
 He snapped the wood up, cracking Antonil across the bottom of his hand, which held firm to his blade.
 Undaunted, the elf stepped closer, ducked underneath the guard captain’s return swing, and then kicked at the arrow still lodged in his shin, finally making Antonil drop his blade.
 The elf stood, drawing an arrow as he did.

“I don’t know,” Harruq said.
 “Did you cast a spell on yourself or something?
 Look like one to me.”
 She stood and took up her staff.
 Instead of grabbing his swords, Harruq ducked behind a tree.
 “Don’t hurt me,” he shouted.
 His face poked around the tree, his long brown hair falling down past his eyes.
 Much as she tried not to, Aurelia burst into laughter.
 “Get over here,” she said.
 A small silver dagger appeared in her hands.

Johnny – Did I miss something?
 Jim – Uhh…Not really, we were just discussing who would win in an all out fight, a gang of angry circus midgets wielding pointed sticks, or the seven dwarves after they find out that Snow White is missing.
 Liz – Ah yeah, yes, that’s it.
 Ten Midgets didja say?
 I’m going with the angry gang of midgets wielding the pointed sticks they have the numbers and pointed sticks.
 Jim – There doesn’t need to be a lot of dwarves, just one of them is worth like 3 midgets, pointed sticks or no pointed sticks.
 What they lack in quantity they make up in quality.
 I mean these guys are huge and muscular, at least from a midget’s perspective, and they have those pick-axes they use around the mine.
 The seven dwarves would win hands down.
 Liz – you’re forgetting that the dwarves have just come home after a long day’s work in the mines.

 No answer.
 “Aurelia!

 Only the calm, scattered sounds of the forest returned his call.
 “Damn elf,” Harruq grumbled, crossing his arms and looking all about.
 “She’s probably not here.

He had to believe his brother was still alive.
 He had to help him.
 Qurrah took out his last healing potion, popped the cork, and then held it before him.
 Blood was beginning to fill his throat once more.
 His stolen energy was quickly fading.
 He had no time to waste.
 He tilted his head as high as the arrow in his neck allowed, positioned the mouth of the vial against his lower lip, and then closed his hand around the arrow shaft.
 One last hissing breath.
 One tremble of his fingers.
 He yanked the arrow out.

The guard’s long sword gave him better reach.
 Rodregas swung at him and retreated.
 The two shared several blows.
 The third time that he retreated after taking a blow, the guard went for the kill.
 The guard extended his whole body out in a lunge, thrusting his long sword out to its full length.
 The guard saw Rodregas’ braided leather armor and steel sword and thrust with the point.
 The lunge was perfect, the guard went for dead center, and even though Rodregas had been waiting for a similar move, the thrust almost caught him off guard.
 The guard had only one problem, one that he could not have anticipated.
 Rodregas had been taking easy swings, not revealing his true speed.
 Once the guard committed, Rodregas brought both of his swords down and met the lunging blade.

Brandon nodded at Britney, who stood there with her mouth slightly open, as he walked away.
 After a second or two of both of us staring blankly after Brandon, Britney grabbed me by the hand, the one holding the new, unopened water bottle, and pulled me over to a table in the corner.
 "Oh my gosh, you just poured water all over Brandon Worthingfield the Third.
 And then he talked to you.
 This is so incredible."
 I more or less fell into my seat, staring at my new bottle of water as Britney's chatter poured over me.
 It was pointless to try and pay attention to anything she was saying.
 It was all I could do to remember to nod when she paused and looked at me expectantly.
 Lunch passed all too quickly.
 Before I knew it we were back at Britney's locker and she was promising to give me a ride home from school after Spanish.

These resources can be applied to environmental monitoring and impact assessment, protection of endangered species, quick response to disasters and accidents, energy conservation, and the minimization and management of waste.
 The appropriate role for the military in these various activities will depend on the country, the urgency of the circumstances, and the cost-effectiveness of military involvement compared with available alternatives.
 In some instances, it may be feasible to establish international ‘Earth corps units’, specially trained and equipped to carry out certain types of environmental protection and restoration, such as India’s eco-battalions, which seek to conserve the Himalayan habitat by restoring tree cover and constructing small dams and canals.
 International development force
 The goals of peace, prosperity and fulfilment for every human being represent formidable challenges – intellectual, attitudinal, organizational and technological.
 We cannot hope to reach such lofty achievements if we waste and squander the precious and abundant resources – mental, psychological, social and material – placed at our disposal.
 A massive reduction in emphasis on weapons production and military establishments, made possible by recent political events and demanded by the pressing unmet needs of people everywhere, represents both a great opportunity and a considerable challenge.
 The opportunity is not only further to reduce the threat of war by reducing the capacity for waging war, but also to redirect and utilize for other purposes the resources now dedicated to war making and prevention.
 The challenge is to do so at a time when rising unemployment and economic stagnation in many countries make further cuts in the size of the military unpopular domestically.
 Since 1990, the total number of military personnel worldwide has declined by two million or about six per cent.

 Harruq and Qurrah waited anxiously at their door.
 They were fully armed and ready.
 The half-orc’s sister swords were sharpened and gleaming.
 Wrapped around his arm, Qurrah’s whip writhed hungrily.
 Their eyes rarely blinked, but as hour after hour passed and no blanket of shadow came to them, their patience wore thin.
 “The human army is right outside the town,” Harruq grumbled.
 “We can’t wait until tomorrow night.”

 The mood in Woodhaven grew somber as dark rumors spread.
 First came word that troops were on their way to enforce an edict evicting all elves from the city.
 The more this rumor spread, the more elves seemed to arrive.
 Elven men and women with camouflage and great longbows patrolled the city.
 Even more lingered in taverns and the homes of kin.
 Many humans left for the homes of family and friends, wanting no part of the coming conflict, while others spent hours whispering with the elf men in the bars.

She was beautiful, but Harruq did not see it.
 To Harruq, she was the young girl cradling her sister.
 Aurelia thrust her right hand forward, her fingers spread wide and stiff.
 Words of power poured from her lips, and without hesitation the forest obeyed.
 Vines shot from the earth and wrapped around Harruq’s arms and legs.
 Down he went.
 Aurelia gave him no chance to recover.
 She raised her outstretched hand higher.
 More and more vines appeared, covering the half-orc’s arms and legs with green.
 They lifted him into the air, his boots dangling two feet above the ground.

“This is confusing, why don't you understand that?” There was a pause.
 “I do understand; I hated it too.
 All the annoying riddles but that's the way it's supposed to be.” Then the voice said stronger, “Look behind you.” I turned back around to see the inside of the cave.
 A girl was walking towards me, the same one I saw last time.
 She didn’t like it because I was staring at her, but I couldn't help it.
 She stopped in front of me.
 “You're not supposed to see me yet,” she said and sighed.
 “Oh well, I never was one to follow the rules.” “Who are you?” She shook her head.
 “I can't tell you yet.
 That's one rule I'm not going to break.” I opened my mouth but she shook her head.

Mother has been too ill lately for guests.
 I have not been able to see her.
 The tedium of my duties is getting to me and Father has been relentless with my studies, pushing me harder and harder to strengthen my control.
 My sister has been exploring the mountains.
 I see her bring in all sorts of interesting finds, but she refuses to tell me where she got them.
 I wish there were a way to sneak out.
 I would follow her or force her to show me, but Father is keeping a close eye on me, making certain I stick to a strict schedule.
 This morning he brought in a detailed list for Rune, giving him direction through a series of tasks.
 Rune is supposed to grade me on them, see which I excel most at so they can pick a specific field to concentrate on.
 I don’t know how extensive it was, but I saw ‘wind,’ ‘water,’ ‘growth,’ ‘transfer,’ ‘fire,’ and ‘foresight’ written as it passed between them.

I think you need to go there now.” Rodregas nodded.
 “Can I bring you two into the Chamber as my advisors?” “That does seem to be allowed,” said Imeralda, “Traditionally that is more about fathers with sons, not half bloods and Hellborns, but I think we might have a bigger problem.” She stopped speaking mid sentence, and Rodregas curiously looked back at her, but she was staring ahead.
 A figure stood there tall and graceful.
 He had appeared out of nowhere, as if by magic.
 It was Van’dret.
 “Ah, I see the three of you are all together and far away from the others, how convenient for me.” Van’dret casually reached out toward the side wall and they could vaguely hear him mumble a few words.
 A second later the sound of doors slamming and bolts and locks sliding closed echoed from every direction.
 “I hope you don’t mind, but I don’t think I want to be interrupted.” Rodregas reached for his sword, but found he did not have one.
 He froze for but a second, unsure of what to do.
 Then Van’dret spit on the ground and spoke a guttural sound.

I was only gone for about 30 minutes or so and the next thing I know when I came back Gene is talking with these people about God and Jesus and eternal salvation and stuff.
 He’s nodding along, and looking as if he is really interested in eternal damnation.
 They lead him inside to talk more, and I don’t see him for several days.
 Art – I thought I kept up with the wild and wacky adventures of Gene, but I don’t remember any of this happening.
 Jim – It was during the divorce.
 Gene’s response was to protest God.
 Art – He is a creative kid, too bad his energies aren’t focused to a better cause.
 If he’d apply himself he would make a fantastic fiction writer.
 Ah well, Gene is Gene, doubtful that he would ever change.

Rachel let out a high-pitched sound that had all of the surprise of a squeal, but none of the excitement.
 Apparently Alec knew how to interpret it.
 He turned back and caught me again before I could hit the ground.
 "There isn't anything to worry about now.
 Go ahead and catch your breath."
 As pleasant as it was to be in his arms again, I was starting to worry he'd get tired of it.
 I pushed him away as soon as I was reasonably confident my knees would support me.
 "What's going on?
 Why are they so scared of Brandon?"
 Alec shook his head.

Her last words confirmed it.
 “No one knew to check.
 How would they?
 I mean, a new species.
 A new breed.
 And lethal.
 Poison to her mother.
 They couldn’t even know that was what had happened until the others.
 Until the pattern became patent and they found the source.” I stared at Ruby, imagining the nameless “others” who’d been taken by her venom before they discovered its root.
 But it was not the idea of those strangers that tightened my chest.

I didn’t think I blamed him—he seemed to be involved by chance—but I hadn’t fully decided yet.
 As we rode wordlessly through the cold stone landscape, my thoughts twisted and writhed as if a pit of vipers.
 In the end, I’d decided I wasn’t really that shocked about being half-human.
 It explained so much about myself.
 Clumsiness, lack of skill, never quite fitting in.
 What took me by surprise was the betrayal I felt.
 All the years I’d lived in the village, I’d never counted on anyone the way I had done with this group, Chevelle especially.
 The feeling in my chest was so thick and heavy it burned.
 Struggling with my reactions kept me distracted from the ride.
 It was steep now, rocky, a haze hanging in the few spiky trees.

 Harruq’s anger and frustration simmered and swirled in a dying fire.
 He could not argue with her, not about that.
 Even he could see what she had sacrificed to save his life.
 “Where do we go?” he asked, his voice revealing his defeat.
 “We’ll figure it out in the morning.
 For now, we travel north.
 Your brother will be fine, I promise.”

“Well, yes.
 A little cold for lake bathing here.” She led me to a large basin in the corner of her room.
 Water streamed in from the window and filled it halfway.
 “I’ve laid out some clothes for you and there are some lovely soaps on the table.” She spun and glided out of the room, closing the door behind her, and all I could think was, Lovely soaps.
 I examined the room as I undressed.
 A large bed topped with decorated pillows and colorful blankets centered the opposite wall, twice the size of the one I’d been using.
 A tall rack in the corner was draped with materials—deep violet and emerald-green silks, dark wools, and a rainbow of patterned scarves.
 Shelves alongside were filled full with curiosities and a few books lay on the bedside table near a lantern.
 I stepped into the tub, sinking down as lavender-scented steam rose to dampen my face and hair.
 I breathed deep.

Her eagerness to touch his body made him feel a little put off.
 It was good to be touched, in fact, he craved it.
 But her eagerness highlighted to him that the body she wanted to touch was not really his.
 It was the body of Gerald, not Rodregas.
 Her body was everything that he had thought it would be, both wonderfully hard and lush.
 To say she was the most beautiful woman he had ever enjoyed touching was a ridiculous understatement.
 Imeralda reached up to his neck and pulled herself up on top of his lap.
 She wrapped her legs around him and hoisted herself up like she was climbing the trunk of a tree.
 He had wanted to take his time and explore her with his hands and lips, but clearly she was in no mood for foreplay.
 Rodregas in turn was in no mood to stop her now that his own passion was building, and there was no reason to think that they would not be repeating this experience.

I was just kidding, you know, about the near fight and then telling Alec off and having Britney decide she was moving on to greener pastures.
 I didn't mean anything by it."
 The attack was still trying to overwhelm me, but Brandon not knowing the full extent of my weakness robbed it of some of the momentum necessary to roll me all the way under.
 I managed some kind of reply, one that might've even been witty, but which apparently didn't manage to cover up the fact I wasn't really okay.
 We drove in silence the rest of the way into town, and by the time we turned into the school parking lot I'd come back to myself enough to be desperately looking for something else to say.
 I needed something cool enough Brandon wouldn't write me off as a lost cause.
 Wish-granting fairies somewhere were working overtime, because as Brandon turned off the engine, I saw a mob of people over by one of the smaller entrances to the school.
 "Wow, I wonder what's going on over there."
 We were both out of the car now, and it seemed the most natural thing in the world to grab Brandon's arm and tug him over to the crowd.
 It wasn't until I felt the iron-hard muscles under my now-tingling hand that I realized what I'd done.

I wasn't entirely satisfied, but nodded, and followed her to algebra.
 Mrs. Campbell shot us both a glance that didn't bode well for any attempt to get out of class without a stern reprimand, but allowed us to go to our respective seats without comment.
 I pulled out the two assignments I'd done the night before, and passed them up with everyone else's homework.
 Realizing the lecture wouldn't do me any good, I pulled out my book, and started reading the next section in my self-appointed study regimen.
 Mrs. Campbell either understood what I was trying to accomplish, or was saving up all her venom for after class.
 She didn't call on me even once.
 Britney wasn't so lucky, and I caught a nasty look from her each time I surfaced from my textbook.
 The glares angered me more than I'd expected.
 I was having to catch up on a month's worth of assignments; she didn't have any right to get pissy just because she wasn't prepared.
 The third time it happened, I stopped pretending not to notice and shot Britney a sugar-sweet look of my own.

“So you felt like getting us back?” Jason asked.
 Emily glared at him, “You deserved it because you soaked us too.” “So,” he rolled his eyes, “you thought you could just ambush us.
 Have you learned nothing and that we might want revenge now.
 Then you will and so on.
 You’ve started a really long war.” “Who says the penguins can’t win a war, huh?
 We just won right now,” Emily said.
 “The penguins?” “Does that really matter?” she hissed.
 “You’re on.” Jason smirked, “Alright then, penguins, if you want a water war, you got one.” “You’re on too!” This whole time Seth didn’t say a word, which was strange.
 Usually Seth did all the talking while Jason stood watching but now Jason was doing all the talking and Seth was the one watching.
 He stood there and seemed unmoved from being soaked by my water gun.

He was a little worried that she would have trouble handling his size, but she literally started bouncing on his lap and his own groans joined hers and he stopped thinking and gave himself to the pleasure of the moment.
 Afterwards, well… after several afterwards, they were curled up on her mattress.
 Rodregas was very happy he had salvaged the mattress from Captain Poir.
 He had had no way to know that the mattress was going to come in so handy.
 He lay there with Imeralda's head laying on his shoulder and her body half draped on his own and half on the mattress, he was thankful that Doi’van had clearly heard what was going on.
 Rodregas assumed he must have slept back in the barn.
 Doi’van walking in unaware of the situation would have been very embarrassing.
 Rodregas had suggested to Imeralda that they should stop in case Doi’van walked in, but she had shown no signs of caring and quickly took the thought away from him with her actions.
 Rodregas wanted to ask her what this encounter had meant, but he knew that while such questions were natural they were never helpful.
 Two people fresh from their first lovemaking were in no place to talk about a relationship.

 Johnny – It’s not worth reading, he just writes about his ‘thoughts’.

You, me, most of the rest of the school, we survive by staying neutral.
 For better or worse, we aren't attractive, cool, or rich enough to get in with Alec or Brandon.
 Once you piss one of them off though, you'd better hope you're in with the other one, because that's the only way you've got any kind of protection."
 It was starting to sound like organized crime or something.
 Of course they could make my life miserable socially, but it wasn't like they were going to really hurt me.
 I opened my mouth to try and calm Britney down, but she cut me off.
 "You don't understand how much influence they have.
 Three years ago someone tried to start a newspaper in Sanctuary.
 Things were going along just fine until he pissed off Alec's mother.
 The city condemned the building and refused to change the zoning laws so he could get another place.

 “An elf came, killed several nobles, and took the king’s ear.
 Then his cousin is slain bearing a message to this town, his head left at the gate of our city.
 Paranoia it might be, but it is justified.”
 Antonil quieted.
 Dieredon watched him, amazed just how young the man could still look in the moonlight.
 He was a year beyond forty, yet he commanded the entire Neldaren army.
 Publicly, he handled the weight wonderfully, but when prying eyes were gone, his all-too-human fear and doubt showed.

I'd been so busy watching the byplay behind Rachel that I'd missed the last two exchanges between her and Cassie.
 Whatever had been said must have been bad though.
 Rachel was shaking, and the blonde looked like someone about to pull the wings off a butterfly.
 I could feel my heartbeat climbing, slamming away at my ribs with all the energy of a full-blown panic attack, but I wasn't dizzy, just scared.
 The cafeteria workers had all turned around so their backs were facing us, a sight which kindled the first spark of anger, an emotion that burned brighter because of the fear still coursing through me.
 There was a gasp as Cassie shoved Rachel, a misleadingly casual motion that sent the smaller girl stumbling back into Alec's chest hard enough to leave bruises.
 The typical catcalls were still absent, it was as if nobody viewed this as a normal fight, like there was somehow more at stake.
 I'd been waiting for someone to intervene on Rachel's behalf.
 It was obvious she knew nothing about fighting.
 Cassie wasn't the kind of girl to fight just to prove a point and then forget about the incident afterwards.

Britney was trying to cater to my supposed fear of being in a speeding car.
 Only, my supposed fear was actually a very real fear, just not for the reasons Britney thought.
 Chapter 11 Brandon arrived just in time to pick me up before I got on the bus.
 As expected, he teased me about not waiting for him at my house, but it was a small price to pay for not having to worry about how I was going to get to school if he didn't show up.
 We made small talk and all too soon arrived at school.
 As we pulled into the parking lot I was desperately looking for something witty or insightful to say.
 I needed to give him a reason to stay interested in me, but nothing came to mind.
 As we pulled to a stop, the quiet hum of a cellphone on vibrate broke the strange paralysis that'd gripped me for the last twenty seconds.
 Brandon's grin was more than a little sheepish as he fished his phone out of a front pocket and checked to see who was calling.
 I didn't need his groan to know it was one of his friends.

Our hotel is right off the highway--we're almost there."
 "When will we see the movie studios?"
 "One tomorrow, one Tuesday.
 We'll get some brochures at the hotel and see what else sounds good to you for the rest of the week."
 They pulled up to the hotel minutes later.
 They checked into their rooms, which were side by side, and Rick suggested that Marie unpack while he ordered a pizza.
 "I don't feel like unpacking and sitting around.
 Can't we go out for dinner?"
 "Aren't you tired?"

"Thank you."
 Alec shrugged and gave me another smile.
 "You must have driven your parents crazy with that refusal to back down."
 "I suppose I might have frustrated them a time or two."
 "And to think Rachel says I'm stubborn."
 I started to smile, but stopped as he cocked his head to the side in what was unmistakably a listening posture.
 "What's the matter?
 What do you hear?"
 "Jasmin just left."
 "What's wrong with that?"

He looked about sixteen.
 His haircut might have come from a Marine base.
 He wore glasses and a smile I interpreted as phony.
 He passed out a Bible tract, a directory of churches, and a card with his name and phone number.
 I thought, call you for what?
 This kid, I believed, had spent more time in church than outside in the real world.
 He hadn’t attended a dozen funerals, known anyone like Eric, read Nietzsche or Dostoyevski.
 Most of all, he wasn’t Billy Graham.
 Besides, I glanced to the right of the kid and saw the babe with auburn curls.
 She stood with hands folded at her waist and creamy white legs quivering below the hem of her flowered sundress.

The painting was still wet, right down to the signature which had been done in the palest green.
 The scene was from the point of view of someone looking into a bedroom window, darker than most of the later stuff I'd just looked at.
 The centerpiece, done in a dimmer light than what I remembered from my dreams, was the sleeping figure.
 She was delicate-looking.
 A tiny figure, a being of light temporarily clothed in flesh, one who seemed almost at the point of breaking out of her mortal husk.
 She was so breathtakingly beautiful it was several seconds before I noticed the other, nearly unformed details of the room.
 They were so indistinct it took me a full minute to place them.
 Once I did, my eyes darted back to the sleeping figure, the gorgeous one whose features I now recognized as Cindi's.
 Only it couldn't be Cindi because the room was mine, the one here in Sanctuary.
 My pulse racing, I refused to look at the signature again.

Ok, I wrote “Burn my Bridges” on speed, which is an angry drug, and it’s such an angry song.
 I don’t know, it’s not one of my favorites now, even though it’s newish.
 I wrote it one night—I think Lor and I had had a fight,  a rare fight, and she had gone to a girlfriend’s house and I just thought, fuck it, I’m gonna do speed and stay up all night.
 I didn’t plan on writing.
 I thought, I’ll just speed and watch late night TV—there was some John Agar movie on—You dig John Agar?
 No?
 Don’t know him?
 Anyway, I was sitting there and there was a legal pad on the coffee table because earlier in the day I had tried writing a song about my mother—don’t ask—and it was sitting there like an invitation and I was speeding like a hell-rooster, man, and I just picked up the pad and this big fat marker, I mean I was writing these huge thick letters on the  page (laughs) and I just started, “You were mean to me/Leave me alone, let me sit in my tree/You were a snake, I needed you then/you were like bad heroin.”  And I ripped the whole thing off in about an hour.
 And I recorded it that night in my living room, fingers tearing over my strings till they bled, I was playing so hard, like Richie, and that song, that was recorded in my home—it sounds like it.
 But it was born of anger, and so, well, it’s not one of my faves.

9.Disseminate information: Encourage the establishment of new institutions, programmes and systems to speed and extend the dissemination of practically useful information as a powerful catalyst for more rapid social progress.
 Encourage a national climate of open-mindedness to foreign ideas, influences and success stories.
 10.Increase the velocity of money and other transactions: Increase the speed of commercial transactions, especially money flows, in the economy by streamlining government and banking procedures, ensuring rapid utilization of funds by all government agencies, setting strict limits on the time taken for bank transfers, introducing agencies for credit verification and collection of unpaid bills, and improving the telecommunications infrastructure.
 11.Revamp higher education: Educational systems which 'manufacture graduates' compound the problem rather than alleviating it.
 The problem of the educated unemployed is not so much the amount of education they receive, but the type of knowledge and attitudes imparted.
 Reorient the educational curriculum at all levels, especially higher education, to impart the knowledge and attitudes needed to promote self-employment and entrepreneur ship rather than salaried employment.
 12.Employment planning: Studies of Japan and the NIEs indicate that conscious employment planning is an essential requirement for generating full employment.
 Place the employment objective high on the national agenda and evolve a comprehensive plan to achieve full employment by identifying untapped growth potentials in agriculture, industry, exports and services.
 Launch a nationwide programme to implement all employment-related strategies on a highest priority basis.

My body had already started spiraling down to an attack again, but before I could get too wobbly, I made it inside the house.
 Mom met me at the bottom of the creaking stairs with a big smile on her tired face.
 "The view from the rooms as the sun starts to set is even better than I thought it would be.
 Coming here was the best idea we've ever had."
 Normally Mom's enthusiasm was fairly catching.
 You expect that kind of energy in a child; when it comes from an adult it's hard not to react in kind.
 It didn't manage to infect me this time, but it did help focus me on the here and now.
 I figured I owed her for that, so I tried to suppress my generally ungracious nature.
 I even let her lead me up the creaky stairs to show me the 'amazing view' for the third time.
 Mom pulled the mirrors out of my hands as soon as I reached the larger bedroom, and nudged me towards the window.

“It seems there was some trouble in town today,” she said.
 “The elders are in an uproar.” I didn’t question any further.
 Town trouble was usually of no interest to me.
 Actually, I couldn’t think of the last time the town had had trouble… She huffed and I knew it was best to indulge her.
 “What sort of trouble?” “Apparently, Evelyn of Rothegarr came into town from the meadows at full speed wheezing and sneezing.
 She reached the village center, grabbed her throat, and fell to the ground without a breath.
 Dying.” I stopped chewing, my mouth gone dry.
 Fannie continued, “They found a common thistle caught in her airway.” My stomach curled into knots.
 I whispered, “A thistle?” “Mmm.
 Council thinks she must have been working a spell that went awry.” Fannie peered at me; I might have turned pale.

 "But you've never loved him like you did Andrew."

 "Yes, I understand.
 But--" "No.

 She cried against her mother's shoulder until her tears were exhausted.

 Was he sorry he'd made it possible for her to go home?

Not for long anyway.” He knew me better than I did.
 I had told him some part of me blamed myself for my dad’s first heart attack, the one that weakened him and probably set him up for the big one.
 On a sweltering summer day, I had teased him about being old when he declined to volunteer to keep score at a golf tournament I played in, though I knew all about his angina.
 He must've wanted me to believe in his strength.
 So he changed his mind and walked the course, and landed in the hospital.

So, anyway, this beautiful woman followed me from city to city—she was a gypsy—and she dressed like a gypsy—I can’t tell you her name cuz you’d know it, man.
 Her heart is a legend.
 But, I didn’t know who she was until I was inside her and she was moving like God’s immaculate machine.
 Damn, she could ball.
 And, I was, I thought, in love, for only the really second time in my life.
 I wasn’t thinking, like, I gotta leave Lor, it’s gonna be painful, I want to be with this woman, this white light.
 I wasn’t thinking, period.
 Anyway, Lor knows all this—it’s cool, it’s cool.
 Lorelei, you gotta understand, is amazing, she’s like so together, and she understands human nature and sees it for the shoddy stuff that it is, and she accepts everything, man, like all human interaction is innocent, you dig?

He knew he wouldn't be able to bear it if he went home and found that she had disappeared.
 After nearly four hours of trying to concentrate on his work, he gave up and told his secretary that he wasn't feeling well and was going home.
 On his way there, a shop window caught his eye, and he slammed on his brakes, causing the driver behind him to lean on his horn.
 He circled around and dashed into the store.
 Marie had just sat down in front of the TV with a dish of ice cream when she heard the garage door open.
 How odd--why would Rick come home in the middle of the day?
 Remembering how he'd seemed to feel ill yesterday, she set her ice cream down and ran to meet him.
 Rick was just getting out of his car.

 Liz – Which won’t be any time soon if you keep this up.
 Jim – Ah, well.

"Be prepared, OK?
 I think you'll find them a little immodest."
 She tried to prepare herself, but she was shocked by the outfits she was shown.
 The material was thin, and they all had plunging necklines, and some were cut so that the edge of the leg hole was almost as high as the arm hole.
 But she managed to find two, one red and one black with pink flowers, that were less shocking than the others and took them to the dressing room.
 These weren't going to work.
 She'd chosen the two with the least amount of décolletage, and they still wouldn't work.
 They wouldn't completely hide her chest binding.
 She left the dressing room shaking her head.
 "These don't fit, Rick."

Billy, like his brother Cliff, had a gift for drawing.
 On Sunday morning about nine, I phoned Kenny to tell him Billy was at my house and ask when he meant to pick us up.
 Things weren’t decided yet, he said, because Eddie Carmichael and Mike Beatty wanted to go along, except not to Laguna Beach.
 They wanted to drive to the desert, to the Indio Date Festival, which they claimed was a good party.
 Billy and I didn’t favor the idea of six guys, including big Mike Beatty, riding 150 miles over the mountains and back in Kenny’s mom’s Volkswagen.
 Still, I asked Kenny to call us when the plans were settled.
 He promised to.
 But he didn’t.
 Eric told him not to, I would learn the next day.
 Eric, whom no one recalled having done a single mean act, or said a single mean word, had told Kenny to leave us behind.

She mistook my reaction.
 “Oh, don’t be silly.
 I wouldn’t play the same design twice.” I relaxed, but only a little.
 “Besides, I will let you in on a little secret… the fairy’s breath isn’t really breath.
 Can you imagine if it were?
 Why, everywhere we go we’d cause a terrible ruckus.
 It’s a blend, is all.
 We keep it in a tiny capsule in our cheek and when we need it…” She chomped her teeth together with a click, the look surprisingly feral.
 And then she smiled, her face melting back into something very near adorable as she held a finger to her lips, protecting the secret.

I closed my eyes as a wave of heat started at my collarbones and rushed up to the tips of my ears.
 I wanted to throw up, except that would be even more embarrassing than being carried out of class by the most popular boy in school.
 I opened my eyes and found we were already out in the hall.
 Alec's stride was so smooth it was hard to believe we weren't still back in the classroom.
 "Put me down, I mean please put me down."
 Those clear, deep eyes met mine for a second, seeming to look past the surface and all the way down to the bleeding mental gash that'd just triggered my most recent collapse.
 I was trying to marshal my arguments, but his eyes wiped my mind clean.
 I couldn't form another coherent thought until he shook his head and looked away.
 "You need to see the nurse."
 My mind hiccupped for a second.

The thought slipped away like sunlight skipping across water a split second before the storm arrived.
 The attack was a bad one.
 I lost more time.
 I must have slept at some point, but the next time I surfaced it was Saturday morning and I was sitting in front of an empty bowl with an unopened box of cereal and a gallon of milk waiting in the wings.
 At some point I realized I wasn't hungry.
 I put everything back away and went upstairs for a shower.
 It didn't help.
 By the time I was done, I was clean but just as emotionally numb as before.
 At least I'd turned the water all the way to cold there at the end.
 I came out shivering, but it was a welcome change from the oppressive heat.

Gorin lifted a large handle and solid squares of iron slid out of the floor and the ceiling.
 When both the top and the bottom fully released the guard pushed the doors wide.
 The three immediately pushed through and Rodregas said, “You can close the doors.
 I will pound on them when we are ready to leave.” And with a nervous nod the doors slid closed behind them.
 As the door closed Gorin hastily added, “Remember not to touch anything until the Grand Marshal is present.” Doi’van nodded at the now closed doors and raised his torch.
 The three gazed around the room in wonderment.
 In response to the torch the room seemed to respond with a vague light of its own, which came from all directions.
 The chamber was large with a tall vaulted ceiling like some temple, but no rows of seats or prayer mats did this temple hold.
 Instead it was filled with beasts; lions and wolves and the great mythical animals of the Celestial Realm.
 Most of these he recognized as the great totems of the Celestial Realm, each representing great power.

In a fair fight no mortal was a match for one of the Immortalists.
 “Luckily,” thought Rodregas, “I have no intention of playing fair.” The two female Dire Cats that had been used to lure the Celestial Lion to the tower had fascinated Rodregas since Ravenhurr, at the expense of a very large part of his fortune, had been able to purchase them from the Immortalist Guild dealer Taiga.
 When Rodregas looked into their eyes he had seen a greater understanding than that possessed by mere animals.
 When they growled, it felt like the earth trembled.
 When Rodregas had seen the Dire Cats in their cage he had not been able to imagine a more powerful lion.
 The Celestial Lion was simply breathtaking; almost twice as large as the Dire Cats and even more powerfully built.
 It was not simply size that set him apart however.
 It was a way of moving, a grace that spoke of perfection.
 To look at a Celestial Beast made Rodregas wish he could write poetry like some noble in one of the high western courts; it made him struggle for words that he simply did not have.
 And what did this marvelous beast do?

He leaned over, working on something in the palm of his hand, a steady scratching accompanying the movement of his wrist.
 I started forward and my boot scuffed the floor, alerting him to my presence.
 As he glanced up, he slid whatever he’d been working on into a pocket at his hip.
 It dawned on me then that the main room had only the entrance and two other doors.
 If we were staying with Ruby then the second room must be hers.
 I meant to offer Chevelle my room to sleep in, but the look on his face was so unnerving I could not stop myself from offering something else.
 “You don’t… you don’t have to protect me.” I hoped it was true.
 “I can turn myself in, take myself to the village, or…” I was trying to say Grand Council, but the words stuck in my throat.
 No part of me wanted to surrender to my mother’s killers, but I could not make Chevelle suffer more than he already had.
 My hands trembled and I tightened them into fists.

Alec drew the blinds, which didn't do anything to muffle the principal's raised voice.
 Fifteen minutes later, after the unmistakable feeling of Alec's power had crested to the point where it almost felt like there was a breeze blowing from the office, we were all sitting down with the bewildered school counselor and playing musical classes.
 Only it turned out Rachel and I were the only ones not changing our schedules.
 I started to protest being treated differently than everyone else, only to feel my mouth click shut as Rachel shook her head at me.
 It wasn't until Alec was walking me to Biology that I finally got an explanation.
 "You and Rachel are the ones who need the most sleep, ergo you don't change classes."
 "That's crazy."
 I would've stopped.
 You can't really have a good disagreement while you're walking down the hall, but we happened to be holding hands, which he used to keep me moving along.
 And here I'd been so excited back in the councilor's office when he'd taken my hand.

Our son proudly toured us around the grounds and introduced us to everyone we passed.
 He was so enthusiastic and so different.
 Although he was excited to see us, he was calm and collected.
 He was respectful to all and excited to show off his family, he seemed to know everyone.
 We met many of the people who we spoke with on the phone and got to put their faces with their names.
 Every worker we met was a recovering drug addict and a one-time student of Narconon.
 People from all walks of life, from all over the country and all ages; it was a mosaic of America’s addicts trying to change their lives.
 The longer the students were there, the more naturally they mentored the new arrivals.
 After about a half hour visiting the center, the facility had transformed for us— from a roadside dive motel to an oasis of healing.

They are essentially synthetic heroin, and much sought after by the drug addicts who litter your streets, work alongside you and perhaps sit next to you at a family dinner.
 They are daughters or sons or parents.
 The street price for these pills could reach up to $80 each while the co-pay at the pharmacy for the insured who are prescribed these pills could be as little as $10 for a quantity of ninety.
 That is quite a tidy profit for all involved, and the sellers do not care what casualties wait.
 That is about all that stays the same in the drug world decade after decade.
 The pill commonly referred to by the street name “Oxy” does not get swallowed by addicts in the way the pharmaceutical companies intended.
 To intensify the effect of the drug, they consume the pills in alternative ways: First, they remove the time release coating that covers the pill by either scrapping it off with their fingernail or using a wet paper towel.
 Then, they crush the tablet into a powder and snort it.
 When snorting the Oxy begins to clog up and destroy their noses, or just isn’t getting them high enough, the addict places the pill whole, without the coating, onto a small square of aluminum foil, and holds a lighter underneath.
 The addict rolls the pill around the foil in an odd balancing act so as not to lose the pill off the edge of the hot foil, or to leave it in one hot spot too long.

He headed right for Doi’van and was behind Rodregas before he could do anything.
 Doi’van must have seen him coming from his position and he dropped his bow and pulled his great sword.
 The guard must have been thinking “Forest Nymph” due to the nature of the archery attack from the forest because he was unprepared for the strength of the blow.
 Like the one Rodregas had hit, the sword failed to cut armor.
 The guard, with the speed of his sigil, blocked it.
 But he blocked it sword to sword instead of using the momentum and speed to simply guide the sword away from his body.
 The resulting blow had an unpleasant sound and cut right through Doi’van’s sword.
 Unfortunately for the guard, Doi’van stepped forward as he swung and jammed the lower half of the sword into his opponent’s chest.
 The guard flew into the bushes with a sickening crunching sound.
 Rodregas next heard the sound of another of the enemy and spun into the sound using all his speed and strength, hoping to take a guard with either advantage.

Still I invited her to the prom.
 She accepted.
 Then a girl passed along a rumor that Liz Pence wanted to go out with me.
 Liz was a beauty.
 We dated a few times before the prom, and she would've preferred that I give Karen notice and take her instead.
 But I was neither that cold-blooded nor that stuck on Liz.
 She might be as pretty, but if she possessed any goodness like what I saw in Karen, she hid it deep.
 Prom night, for reasons more complicated than I can remember so long, Cliff was driving a '49 Ford convertible that belonged to Bob Williams, whom I will visit in Portland a few days from now.
 Cliff's date was Chris Latin.
 Karen and I rode in the back seat.

 “Are you sure?” Harruq asked, raising an eyebrow and gesturing to her completely unarmored figure.
 “I’ll only end up hurting you.”
 “You won’t,” she said.
 “Here.

 The half-orc’s jaw dropped a little.
 “You’ve lost your mind?”
 “I said hit me, orc!” Aurelia shouted.

 Jim – What do you mean?
 I thought Art was going to start right away.

 Jim – Isn’t Gene old enough to get around that?
 I thought that the adoption was only a formal thing we were doing.

Suddenly Rodregas’ and the others’ feet were stuck to the ground, and no matter how hard they pulled their feet would not move.
 “You know there is a reason that the Immortalist Sorcerers rule this land.
 I have a few questions for you though before I leave your dried up husks behind for the rats.” Rodregas growled to himself and pulled the only weapon he had, a small dagger, out and threw it hard straight at Van’dret.
 A second dagger flew almost in the same heart beat from Doi’van.
 The sorcerer simply waved in the air and both daggers flew to the side and clattered off the wall.
 The sorcerer smiled, standing tall, and Rodregas had to admit he seemed very relaxed and in control.
 His expensive black and gold robes were perfectly cut, his dark hair was slicked back.
 He might be wearing the body of a twenty year old, but he showed all the self confidence of a man who counted his age in decades if not centuries.
 Van’dret’s voice reflected the articulation and grace of a man who had all the time in the world to enjoy the finer things in life.
 “So let us dispense with the silly games and lies.

But the growing demand for low-cost vehicles generated explosive growth for the industry, creating tens of thousands of new jobs in the process.
 Globally, production rose from less than 250,000 vehicles in 1910 to 42 million in 1980.
 Nine decades later, the automotive industry is still the largest manufacturing industry in the world and the single largest source of jobs in the American economy.
 Every job created in automotive manufacturing has spawned roughly ten more in related occupations.
 Thus, about 9 per cent of the USA’s entire workforce is employed in occupations directly related to automotive manufacture, sales and services, road construction and maintenance, and transport of freight and passengers.
 Globally, 7 to 9 million workers were employed in automotive manufacturing in 1980 and perhaps as many as 50 to 80 million in related occupations.
 In addition, the spread of automotive technology has had tremendous impact on the growth of other industries stimulated by the greater mobility of the public – retail trade, hotels, restaurants, tourism, recreation – and indirectly on agriculture, as well as every other service and manufacturing industry that benefits from lower cost and greater speed of passenger and freight transport.
 Advances in technology provide society with greater conveniences and in the process endow the society with greater creative and productive abilities.
 Over time, these new abilities spur the creation of new activities in many different fields distantly related to the original point of innovation.
 The process results in improvements in health, which raise the level of physical energy; higher standards of education, which raise the level of mental energy and culture; and higher levels of social skills and organization, which raise the energy level of the entire society, making it ever more creative and productive.

He struggled to lift a single numb hand, then flopped it down on top of the dead elf’s leg.
 Qurrah took as deep a breath as he dared and then spoke the words of a spell.
 Each syllable was slow torture, garbled in blood and born of pain most horrid.
 Thankfully, the spell was not complicated, and the words were few.
 He finished the spell mere seconds before his mind succumbed to the sleep that crawled at his eyes.
 Even though he was dead, life energy still swirled inside the elf’s body.
 Normally this energy would be consumed by the earth in burial, but Qurrah had other plans.
 His spell took in this life energy through his hand, filling his body with it, healing his wounds and clearing his mind.
 The darkness fighting for control in his head subsided, a shred of strength returning to his limbs.
 There was still the slight problem of the arrow lodged in his throat.

She leaned in close to my ear with her mouth, her young body firmly against my back, and then asked me seductively if I would sell her the Oxy.
 I told her I would find out how many I had and we could probably work something out and sell them to her.
 She then asked me to turn over and she sat on me, barely above my crotch.
 I immediately noticed a tattooed first name of “Steve” on her flat stomach, just right of her belly button.
 I tapped the tattoo and ask her if that was her boyfriend’s name.
 She leaned into me and whispered that it is just some guy who treats her like crap but she keeps going back to him.
 The fact that she chose to whisper that bit of information convinced me he was outside the open door.
 As we talked I described to her that I had a very controlling wife and two young children at home.
 I told her this because I needed to set some restrictive boundaries; I knew I would need to work within the confines of the narcotics officers, and this would allow me to put her off, buy some time, if I needed it.
 She talked with me and continued to massage my chest as she straddled my naked body.

I gasped and pointed to his leg.
 “Seth, you’re bleeding blue!” He just blinked at him, glancing down at his leg.
 He didn’t answer as he tugged at me to start walking back towards where we had last seen ‘ourselves’.
 We could still see our bodies sleeping peacefully, but this time I noticed that we were all faintly glowing blue.
 I could see the rise and fall of my chest as I breathed.
 So I really was alive, which made this situation even creepier and stranger.
 I had two bodies!
 How was this even possible?
 “What do we do?
 Seth, do you any ideas?” She frowned when he didn’t answer.

“Well, looks like we are going to have to start using these books,” he said.
 Doi’van was clearly listening; his huge body very still, but he had not said anything.
 “What do you say, Doi’van, are you ready to learn some magic?
 I saw how you reacted to the ley line; you clearly have some power.” Doi’van tilted his head to me and said, “Really, do you think so?
 I do feel something now and then, but I have never been tested.
 People see me and how strong I am, they just assume I don’t have magic for some reason.” “Wish I had that problem,” Rodregas said.
 “I mean before, people always used to assume I had neither brawn nor brains.” With a smile he added, “What do you say?
 Shall the three of us set some time aside to teach each other what we know of magic and see what we can learn from these magic books of Ravenhurr’s?” he asked.
 “No,” said Doi’van.
 “I mean, yes, I would like to learn what you can teach me.

 One after another the deft strokes came in, and one after another Antonil batted them away using the methodical style that had helped him rise to his place at the top of the Neldaren army.
 His opponent, a young elf whose swordplay was raw compared to most of his brethren, tried to give him no reprieve.
 The guard captain didn’t falter in the slightest.
 “You sacrifice planning and thought for sheer speed and reflexes,” he said, his breathing steady and practiced.
 He assumed the elf spoke the human tongue, and the sudden killing lunge proved him correct.
 Antonil pulled his head back, the point stopping just shy of drawing blood.
 An upward cut took the blade from the elf’s hand.
 Antonil’s sword looped around, thrust forward, and buried deep inside flesh.
 The elf fell, gasping for air from the fatal wound.

Vincent slowed down a little more as I was busy taking in the incredible pinks and purples that were dominating the western sky.
 It was like someone had splashed glowing paint across a window and then gone back and painted in picture-perfect clouds to complete the scene.
 I'd seen plenty of amazing sunsets back home, but there was something about the rugged, almost hostile, skyline here that gave this one a spectacular level of depth.
 Maybe Mom was right about the west after all.
 Sure, it was hotter than Satan's kitchen, and a dermatologist's worst nightmare, but the skylines were amazing.
 Brandon opened his eyes as I let out a sigh of contentment.
 "Bored already?
 We're only halfway there."
 As I opened my mouth to respond, Vincent turned off the road onto a trail that hardly looked wide enough for a Geo Metro let alone his monster truck.
 I let out a yelp as we dropped down a small hill and then started climbing up the other side of the gully with a small bounce.

We’ll be leaving soon.” I didn’t know if I was that much better.
 “Don’t worry.
 It is safe.
 They will not attack again so soon.” “When?” I could hear the worry in my tone, despite his assurance.
 “We will protect you, Frey.” Sure.
 I might have rolled my eyes.
 “We knew they were following before.
 Our mistake was in assuming they meant a physical attack.
 We will not allow them so close again.” “So they’re still following?” Panic.

So he climbed the bark over to the other branch and then walked on the top, which was very easy.
 He followed Imeralda out on the branch until it started getting thin and began swaying.
 Then he sat on the branch.
 He did not know what to do next.
 His body relaxed when he heard Imeralda’s voice.
 “Are you trying to kill me?” she asked, “and are you really trying to rescue a Forest Nymph from a tree?” The laughter that followed was pure and open and even he had to laugh with it.
 “So,” he asked, “what are you doing?” “Well, I decided that if this was a greater sigil I should touch it.
 Even though I do not want a greater sigil to consume my magic, this is the One Tree.
 And well, I am a Nymph.
 So I reached out and touched the tree and nothing happened.

She was determined not to let me forget what a burden it had been to take me in, even if it used every spare ounce of energy to do it.
 My mouth twisted, and I shifted into a run until I reached the little outcropping of rock on the west side of the village.
 I was still thinking about it when I slowed to climb through the tangle of brush in back of Junnie’s house, but once my fingers trailed the cool rock surrounding the structure, it fell away.
 When it felt as if I could breathe again, I rapped two quick knocks and then one loud knock on the small wooden door.
 It was the one sure way she’d know it was me.
 A wisp of bright blonde hair swirled around Junnie’s shining eyes as the door swung open, and I decided I must have caught her working; she looked flustered.
 Junnie was older than I, but remained striking with the blonde hair, blue eyes, and thin features that seemed to be standard-issue among the village elves.
 The Council had assigned her as my tutor, citing my advanced age as the reason I couldn’t learn with the others, but I suspected it was my stunning lack of ability that had landed me here.
 Junnie brushed a lock of hair aside.
 “There you are, my Fredora!” She was always trying out new nicknames for me.

"I brought some."
 He went to take a bottle from a drawer.
 "I'm not as red as I was last Saturday."
 "Do you-do you want me to-to rub some on you?"
 He glanced up, on the verge of asking her why, since it was only his arms, not his back, that needed the lotion.
 Instead, he silently handed her the bottle.
 Marie squeezed some lotion into her hand.
 Starting at his wrist, she rubbed his arm, working her way up.
 When she reached the tan line where his sleeve began, her hands glided up to the red spot just below his neck.
 "You-you must not have put sunscreen here.

She bounced back over to Jason's side and waited for me to continue but there was nothing else to say.
 I had told her everything I needed to tell her.
 Did she somehow know that I wasn't telling her the whole story?
 I looked at Seth out of the corner of my eye and saw him doing the same.
 We needed to talk longer and more in depth about the situation we were sharing.
 “So,” Emily said and tapped her fingers on the cave wall, “is that all?” “Yes.” “Well then,” she looked us in the eyes, “what are we waiting for?
 Let's get a move on and leave this small, damp cave.” I shrugged and followed her out.
 The sky was lit but still had a gloomy feeling mixed in with the warmth.
 I felt a sense of dread as we entered the never-ending forest again.
 A few rays fought their way through the thick canopy of trees, making it possible to see what was around you.

"You're the most beautiful woman in the world, Marie."
 This evening was a wonderful end to a wonderful day.
 Like the day before, what Rick had enjoyed most was seeing Marie's pleasure.
 She'd wanted to see everything, experience everything they'd let her try.
 Everyone had treated her like an eager tourist, little realizing that she was seeing it all from the perspective of someone who'd seen debuts of Hollywood's earliest offerings.
 "Would you like to go dancing?"
 Rick asked as he paid the bill.
 "I don't think so.
 I'm rather tired, and I think I'd just like to relax and think about all that happened today."
 "And dream about your debut?"

I know that Davis--" "Don't be sorry.

 Marie was too stunned for a moment to move.
 Finally she walked into her father's embrace, glancing at her mother, who simply smiled at her.
 Apparently she'd prepared her father and brother well.
 They decided to leave for Cape Cod two weeks from Friday.
 Marie thought about the bathing suit Rick had bought her.
 Her father would kill her if he ever saw her in such a thing, she mused with a smile.
 "What are you smiling about?"
 John asked her.

He wants to use me, I don't know how yet.
 They're going to do whatever they can to bring me to him; I'm going to have to be extra careful.

 Seth looked up at his best friend.
 “Seth,” Jason repeated, “you aren't alone.
 Kojas isn't going to get a chance to use you because he's going to have to get through me first.” “And me,” Emily added.
 “Don't count me out.” I stood up and faced Seth with Emily and Jason.
 “And he's going to have to get through me too.” Seth smiled and stood up.
 He sighed in relief.
 “Well, that's a load off.” “I don't know whether I should be mad at you for not telling us or be happy that we're all on the same page,” Emily said thoughtfully.

Was it possible to be both shy and confident at the same time?
 If it was, Dominic's fluid, expressive face pulled it off.
 "Nonsense.
 Once we undo all of the damage from her teaching you, you'll do so well even she won't flunk you."
 It went against everything past experience with Mrs. Tiggs had taught me, but I almost believed her.
 Chapter 26 It was amazing how quickly my classes flew by when I had a friend, or at least a protector, with me at all times.
 Then again all of Monday had flown by, not just the school portion of the day, so it really shouldn't have been a surprise today was doing likewise.
 After Spanish, Jasmin had escorted me to Mrs. Campbell's class.
 Telling her I wasn't going to be able to help out at the lab anymore had been one of the harder things I'd ever done, but she'd been surprisingly understanding.
 We'd scheduled my makeup test for the next day and I'd left with the sneaking suspicion she'd guessed more about what was really going on in Sanctuary than either pack would've liked.

I couldn’t have completed this without you!
 Part I: Defining Moments Chapter 1: The Medicine Cabinet I sit alone in my new quad truck with its 22-inch rims; it looks like some 20-year-old spoiled brat has decked it out.
 I am tucked away in a remote parking space at a retail shopping center.
 No one would normally park this far from the grocery store, which anchors an array of businesses, at least not this late at night in this sparsely populated lot.
 I know this place well, as this is where my wife and I buy our groceries.
 It is in an upper class neighborhood serving the wealthy residents who live in their posh homes nearby.
 The front of my truck faces a short decorative fence, which borders a greenbelt area, and I stare across the wetlands that the railing protects.
 As I sit, I think about the circumstances in my life that brought me to this spot.
 I am alert to my surroundings but distracted by my thoughts.

I reached the sword tip back to his leg and made another incision to release the snake.
 It jerked and coiled free of the wound, flicking blood over the tracker’s pristine white robe.
 Behind me, a low voice ordered, “Kill him.” I glanced down at the sword, still in my hand.
 The sword I was supposed to take someone’s head off with.
 I didn’t know who the order had been intended for, but it wasn’t me.
 This man was going to die.
 I knew he didn’t have more than a moment before their magic broke him.
 They would take his life because he was after us.
 After me.
 I didn’t hesitate, just pulled my arm up and swung hard, backhand.

Brandon still fights the demons that call to him in his darkest moments.
 Prescription drug abuse is an epidemic which claims the lives of our youth.
 photo by Devin DeHaven, 2011
 I hope that this book and the website http://www.rxdrugaddict.comcan help addicts better understand that they are not just destroying themselves but also their family and friends.
 I hope they can see that they could have long and productive lives if they chose to feel life instead of numbing it.
 I also hope this can help people to think about their defining moments and to never give up on their addicted loved ones.
 Expecting someone to just stop being addicted is as absurd as asking someone to stop having cancer.
 These addicts need professional help from those who are trained in this field.
 We are ignorant and ill prepared to help and understand an addict and that ignorance could be deadly.
 We can only pray that these addicts can overcome their addiction and start living a clean and sober life one day at a time.

 Things like this only happened in science fiction books.
 Marie took a step backwards.
 “I-I should see if I can find my way home.” “Wait.

By the Celestial gods she is half AElf and half Nymph, who knows what to expect.
 Humans and Orqui are both in the middle of their two extremes and becoming emotionally involved with either always ends with heartbreak.” Doi’van’s deep voice was just stating a fact, if an unpleasant one.
 Rodregas nodded, he agreed but he was not the young man he looked.
 “I do understand that, and I expect nothing from her.”  He smiled and said, “But I do plan to enjoy what we do have for as long as it lasts.” “And when she takes other lovers?” Doi’van asked.
 Rodregas responded with the only answer he had, “I will do my best to handle it and not get jealous,” he said.
 Rodregas knew it would be hard, but he was a hard man and he would have to manage.
 Doi’van nodded, then glanced over to see Imeralda walking over with several of the Grimoires and he added, “I was not angry, in fact, by my people’s standards I was being very easy on you since you are human and can’t handle pain like an Orqui.
 Without pain, you will not reach your potential for quickness and reflexes.
 On the practice field such quickness means fewer bruises.
 On the battle field such reflexes means life and death.” Rodregas nodded, his words held the ring of truth, but he was not looking forward to days of practices and days full of bruises.

As some countries have already proven, high productivity does not necessarily require large tracks of land or high levels of mechanization, but it does require quality inputs, adoption of advanced cultivation practices, efforts to improve the productivity of water, access to credit, infrastructure for storage, producer-oriented marketing and industries for processing.
 Information Empowerment: The poor quality, slow speed and inadequate reach of extension services is the bane of farming in many developing countries.
 ICT can be harnessed to provide farmers with access to state-of-the-art technical advice, quality inputs and market information.
 The proper analysis and replenishment of soil nutrients by itself can double or triple crop yields.
 Utilizing ICT, it is possible to deliver custom-tailored instructions for soil improvement in a timely manner at low cost.
 It can help to promote quality and trade literacy among farm women and men.
 Organizational Linkages: In much of the developing world, agriculture suffers from intense fragmentation of land holdings among small and marginal farmers.
 These farmers tend to have lower levels of education, poor access to technology for upgrading productivity, less access to quality inputs and credit, poor access to storage and processing facilities, and higher losses due to post-harvest crop spoilage.
 Their problems are further aggravated by environmental degradation due to soil erosion, deforestation and depletion of water resources.
 Lack of effective organization and management is a common denominator linking all these deficiencies.

“Easy kill,” another agreed.
 “No challenge,” something else piped up.
 “The King under estimates our abilities.” It laughed.
 A voice hissed, “We will show him.” This was seriously starting to freak me out.
 It was like the dead were talking to me, and I shivered.
 Then I saw them.
 They slithered from the shadows of the trees and bushes.
 There hundreds of them, each easily my height.
 They were covered in black, grey green scales that were each the size of my hand.
 They were layered on its body like plated armor.

Seeking to break the tension, I pointed to his phone.
 "You got a call too?"
 "Yes.
 I'm afraid something has come up.
 Will you be okay here for a few hours?"
 Normal human response was to make a little white lie, but I got the feeling I wouldn't be able to get away with lying to Alec.
 "I rather suspect whatever 'came up' is important enough I'll just have to be okay."
 He flinched a little, like maybe my aim had been a little too true.
 He looked for a moment like he was going to say something, but then his phone started vibrating again, and he simply nodded as he turned and walked away, moving much faster by himself than he did when I was with him.
 As I stared at the empty space where he'd been standing just a second before, I felt my chest start to constrict, and my breathing speed up.

Now I was completely ashamed of my actions the previous night.
 I closed my hand around it and noticed the painting on my wrist.
 A hawk.
 I knew I had to face him.
 This might be a peace offering.
 It might be my last chance.
 I stood and walked into the main room, clutching the figure in my fist for courage.
 Chevelle was not alone.
 A statuesque elf with pitch-black hair and eyes rose as I came into view.
 Not in the respectful ‘a lady entered the room’ way, but in a way that led me to believe he wasn’t happy to have me, or anyone, find him there.

Uncle Fenton.
 My other grandma.
 And three high school friends including my best friend Eric.
 After Eric died, I took a vow.
 I would love nobody.
 Then neither death nor desertion could hurt me.
 The attitude worked, except it doomed my marriage and helped make me crazy.
 When Darcy arrived, the sight of her instantly flushed my heart of that vow against loving.
 I would sooner have risked any torment than given up my bond with that perfect little girl.
 I became a different fellow.

The horrifying thought gripped his mind.
 "If we'd made love, you might have gotten pregnant and then gone back to 1927, and I would never have known that I had a child."
 That thought cooled his desire faster than anything else could have.
 He thought she might have changed her mind about staying if they'd made love—but what if they'd made love and she hadn't?
 Marie began sobbing.
 "I'd love to have your baby."
 "I couldn't bear wondering.
 And you'd be shamed.
 In 1927 you'd-you'd have a hard time finding a man to marry you and raise the baby as his."
 He squeezed his eyes shut but was unable to keep tears from seeping out at the thought of Marie married to someone else.

He's done so much for us."
 He stopped partway through shaking his head.
 "I can't promise he'll even bother to read it, but I'll take it to him if you promise never to talk about this again.
 I don't want to hear even the slightest rumor anything unusual happened in association with this project."
 I nodded, relieved I'd have a chance to jot down a couple of lines, that I'd at least have that much of a link with our protector.
 Mayor Wilkenson waited at the door, almost the perfect picture of a gentleman at his leisure, but his desire to be done with this whole affair was almost palpable.
 I hurried back to the kitchen counter and tore a piece of paper off of the tablet I'd been drawing on.
 Whoever you are thank you so much for what you've done.
 Not just for the job, but for smoothing things over with the bank as well.
 I wish there was some way I could repay you for everything.

One month she would talk about our child-to-be.
 The next month, she would find any such talk distasteful and contend that that her schoolwork was all her mind could process.
 No kid until she passes her exams, I resolved.
 Last October, she passed them with distinction.
 The dissertation would take a year or two but, hoping she could read and write a little while pregnant and while caring for a baby, I suggested that now was the time, if ever.
 Sure, celebrities and other billionaires father kids when they’re ancient, but they can afford nannies who take screaming babies for walks in the park, and they can ship the kids off to boarding schools when as teenagers they metamorphose into demons.
 My big kids are great, and I mean great in the most literal sense.
 Darcy, the artist who could draw better at three years old than I could when she was three and I was thirty three, majored in painting and photography in college and graduated then worked as a newspaper designer but soon turned to teaching.
 She teaches fifth grade kids so underprivileged that not one in her last year’s class of twenty-seven had ever participated in an organized sport.
 She loves the kids, so she’s always developing some new method, like creating a bi-weekly newspaper and having them write columns on their favorite subjects or assigning them to design their dream house and using the assignment to teach basic geometry.

The half-orc shrugged, for some reason embarrassed.
 “I don’t know.
 I just hack it off with a sword if it ever gets to be a bother.
 Been awhile, though.”
 “It shows.” The elf motioned to the grass before her.
 “Sit, and tell me another of your wonderful stories while I make you look less like an animal.”
 Harruq grumbled, but when she frowned and crossed her arms the normal defiance in him melted away.
 He plopped down and sighed.
 “Something must be wrong with me,” he said.
 “Shut up and start telling me more about yourself.”

 He swallowed.
 “Do you know what year this is?” She frowned.
 “What year?” “Yes.
 You know, 1850, 1875, 1900 .
 .

 This year is ...” “1927.” Rick groaned, dropping his head into his hands.
 Things like this only happened in science fiction books.
 Marie took a step backwards.

“Sonowin,” he shouted to his steed.
 “There, you must get to them!”
 The horse snorted, banked around, and dove straight for the approaching hands.
 A quick spiral avoided the first wave.
 Dieredon clutched his bow and held on for dear life, his eyes locking on the man in black who stood perfectly still, his arms at downward angles from his body.
 The rest of the elves were in full retreat.
 He was the only one left.
 Qurrah watched Dieredon’s approach with a gnawing fear in his chest.
 It seemed no hand could touch this one, the horse possessing dexterity beyond what any creature that size should have.
 Velixar showed no sign of being aware of their approach.

“Early morning.”
 Harruq nodded, his whole body fidgeting.
 Now that he’d found her he wanted nothing more than to escape.
 He was supposed to thank her and go, not be mocked and ordered around.
 “Go on home,” Aurelia said.
 “I’ll be waiting for you.”
 He did as commanded, and that fact disturbed him greatly.
 Qurrah was awake when he returned.
 “Where have you been?” he asked.
 “I went out to train,” Harruq said.

“Everyone think!” “How can I think,” I screeched back, “when the ground is rushed towards me at full speed?” “I don’t know Jazell, just think if you want to live,” she said quickly.
 I let out another scream as my body tipped towards the edge of the dragon.
 I felt someone wrap their arm around me and I gave a grunt as I was pulled upright.
 Seth held me, his arm stiff and somewhat uncomfortable.
 I was frozen in fear, realizing that I hated falling.
 This was worse than my fear of rollercoasters.
 “Calm down,” Seth said to me.
 “You’re not going to fall-” “What do you mean, Seth?” I said in a panicked voice.
 “We’re freaking falling right now!” Emily looked at us and she tried to hide the fear in her face.
 “The dragon is going to pull its wings around us to protect us from falling but it’s going to make us fall faster.

These people I was helping, though not on my own but as a paid reporter, were blessing me.
 Like Curly did at Chapters Books.
 And like Mother Teresa blessed me.
 One Saturday a few years back, my friend Diane called.
 As a lay Missionary of Charity, she knew, and whispered to me, that Mother was around, visiting the MC houses in Tijuana and San Diego, in secret like she did, since she preferred not to get mobbed.
 The MCs rise early.
 Diane said Mother would attend Sunday mass at St. Jude's church at 7 a.m. After a late night at a birthday party up the coast, I staggered from bed to my car and blearily followed Diane's directions.
 St. Jude's is near downtown San Diego, in an old flatland neighborhood of two bedroom homes, vintage Chevrolets so lowered so that sparks fly from underneath, plentiful thrift stores, corner groceries and at least one storefront church on every block.
 Mother Teresa's secret had gotten out.
 People in orange vests directed traffic.

Will you be alright?” he asked Imeralda.
 She nodded and seemed relieved as she headed right for the doorway of the One Tree.
 Rodregas feared for her.
 He was not sure what the consequences would be if she touched the One Tree.
 He wanted to follow her, but he followed Doi’van into the Infernal chamber instead.
 “Was it his own Infernal power calling him?” He wondered.
 Rodregas and Doi’van circled the chamber.
 Rodregas was not as familiar with the daemons of the Infernal Realms as he was the great beasts of the Celestial Realm.
 He sat looking at a wolf with the tail of a serpent but with large beautiful white wings.
 Then he slowly walked next to a great bull with bat wings and a head that appeared to be very human.

Expanding programmes for management training, small business education and counselling, marketing assistance and financial management can bring down the failure rate dramatically.
 3.Voluntary part-timism: Increasing the flexibility of working hours will serve the interests of both businesses and workers.
 Encouraging voluntary part-timism by removing the artificial barriers to job sharing created by employment laws, social security tax laws, administrative procedures and trade unions would raise the morale and productivity of those who prefer to work less, while creating openings for many who are now without jobs.
 In the Netherlands, voluntary part-timism has been identified as the biggest single potential for creating new jobs, capable of reducing the country's unemployment by up to 50 per cent.
 Proportionately reducing working hours and salaries can spread the existing work more evenly over more people.
 Evidence suggests that reduced working time can raise productivity significantly.
 Extending vacation time and medical leave in the United States nearer to levels which the Europeans enjoy would create many more job openings.
 Work or job sharing is not an ultimate answer in itself, but it can have a beneficial short-term impact, allowing time for longer-term measures to take effect.
 As a minimum, governments should remove the artificial barriers to job-sharing created by employment laws, administrative procedures and trade unions.
 Social security tax systems should also be modified to remove the in-built bias that increases the taxes of those who hold multiple, part-time jobs, rather than one full-time job.

It was fairly gentle as teasing went, but I hated how my skin looked when I was blushing which meant I blushed more than any two other people.
 Not only that, I couldn't ever come up with anything good to say when someone teased me.
 Brandon seemed to sense my unease, and flashed another gentle smile.
 "I just wanted to find out if you had a way home tonight after you finished up with your math stuff."
 Britney was almost jumping up and down.
 "Oh, don't worry, Brandon, I'll give Adri a ride home.
 The poor thing lives all the way out in the Anderson home.
 I've been giving her a ride into school and home almost every day since she moved."
 Brandon was still smiling, but I got the feeling that it was a little more forced.
 "Perfect.

 "Would you like some more broccoli, Marie?"
 Marie shook her head.
 "No, thank you."
 "She's too excited about seeing me again."
 Tom grinned at his favorite cousin.
 She smiled at him.
 "So you're saying you've made me lose my appetite?"
 "I wouldn't phrase it like that."
 She loved seeing Tom again.

He rocked backward, the color draining from his face.
 “No, I didn’t mean to, I didn’t…‌I didn’t…”
 Aurelia tried to say something, tried to comfort him, but no noise came from her throat.
 She was dying.
 “No!” Harruq shouted.
 He pulled out one of his healing potions, yanked off the cork, and forced the contents down Aurelia’s throat.
 The elf gagged, retching up half of it onto her neck and chest.
 Harruq got out his last potion but could not open it for the shaking of his hands.
 Desperate, he put it down, picked up one of his swords, and shattered the top of the vial.
 He flung the potion back to Aurelia’s mouth, nearly shredding her lower lip on the broken glass.

“I do as I wish,” Qurrah whispered back.
 He felt a touch of cold on his fingers, like the fleeting kiss of a corpse lover.
 _You ally with the city of men?_
 “Again, I do as I wish,” Qurrah whispered.
 “Who are you talking to?” Harruq asked.
 “Qurrah, what’s going on?”
 “Nothing,” Qurrah said.
 He tore his gaze back to the fight.
 More orcs had pushed inward, leaving them bunched in a wide circle.
 They flung themselves against the surrounding guards.

Part of the reason she felt like she could be gone so much ever since the accident was the fact that I always did the responsible thing.
 If she started thinking I was cutting class, she was going be furious.
 It would be like I was behaving irresponsibly and taking away her ability to pursue her art, all at the same time.
 It was past time for the bus to arrive, and she still wasn't here.
 A car zipped around the corner driving way too fast, just like Britney always did, but it wasn't white.
 I looked past it, hoping to see another one following it.
 My mouth nearly hit the ground when I recognized the throaty roar and dark paint job of Brandon's Mustang.
 "I knew you'd be sitting here worrying she wouldn't come."
 It took a minute for the words to make sense.
 "Fine, but that doesn't shed any light on why you're all the way out here."

You will focus on the front of the caravan and also focus on the regular slavers.
 Don’t start shooting until Doi’van does, hold steady until they get close and then use your Forest Nymph skills to fade back into the trees well away from the fighting.” Then he said very carefully, so she would understand, “Don’t get yourself killed.
 But if you can stop and turn, take a few more shots.
 If they again turn and charge, you run and don’t stop running.
 Forget the horses; you will be much harder to track without them.” He was about to ask Imeralda how long until they would arrive, when Rodregas started to hear noises from up the road.
 The party carrying the captives had arrived.
 Rodregas held a finger to his lips and waved Imeralda deeper into the trees.
 With any luck she would be safe; it was hard to catch a Forest Nymph who was trying not to be found in the trees.
 Doi’van stepped partly out of the shrubs and got behind a tree to give him cover against return fire.
 There was a good-size tree not far in front of the two of them.

So guess what?

 The glow of the spirit faded.
 It looked back and forth, shaking and moaning.
 “You cannot be bastard children of mine,” Ahrqur said, his voice weak and distant.
 “Celestia cannot hate me so.”
 “Celestia has nothing to do with this,” Qurrah said.
 “It is truth.”
 Almost all the spirit’s glow was gone.
 Only hatred and disgust lingered in his eyes.

I got the feeling Alec's technique was superior.
 He moved from spot to spot, motion to motion with the smooth economy of a tree bending before the wind, but if he was a tree, Brandon was the hurricane.
 Flare-light reflected off of deadly claws, and blood splattered the earth as Brandon drove Alec before him.
 Gashes appeared on both leaders, wetly glistening in the green light, but they were more numerous on Alec than on Brandon.
 I expected the unseen plane to mirror the fight I was so desperately trying to track with my inferior vision.
 There should have been titanic clashes of power, ants marching up and down my skin from being far too close to ground zero, but there weren't.
 Brandon's energy beat down on Alec, beat down on all of us, but although I could feel the answering flare of power from the rest of the pack, Alec remained silent, dancing away from the worst bursts of metaphorical death at the same time he dodged Brandon's fangs.
 The flares were almost dead, but there was just enough light for me to see the smaller figure reel away from the larger as a vicious slash sank home in Alec's chest.
 Time stretched and pulled like taffy, and I had plenty of time to watch Alec fall, to feel splatters of hot liquid even standing so far away.
 A scream ripped itself free from my throat, and it suddenly seemed we really were caught up in a hurricane.

 Well your father has been cheating on me too, with his secretaries, since just a little while after you were born.
 Liz – I’ve got pictures of that as well.
 It all makes for a wonderful family album to show my children one day.
 ‘Look kids, here’s your grandmother and another one of her “friends”.’  ‘Mommy, grandma sure had a lot of friends,’ ‘yes sweetie she did, but so did your grandfather.’
 Cleo – And when do you ever plan to have children hmmm?

"Did you have a good time tonight?"
 "Mmm."
 She leaned over and kissed his cheek.
 Rick was glad that the trip home was long enough to give him a chance to cool down.
 If they'd been alone at home instead of leaning against his car in his sister's driveway, he would have had a hard time stopping.
 So when they got home and Marie put her arms around his neck, obviously ready to pick up where they'd left off, he held her away.
 "We need to talk about this."
 She kissed his chin.
 "About what?"
 "Kissing.

“Only elves?” His mocking smile widened.
 “Only elves.” They thought killing an animal with magic was evil, dark, but they were hunting us down.
 To burn us.
 I considered the alternative—pierced through with arrows, blessed with a prayer—and I laughed.
 His eyes were intense as he reached to gently cup my neck, fingers resting at my spine, thumb grazing the base of my ear.
 I felt him urge me forward, and my breath caught, heart stuttering into a broken lope.
 And then Ruby was beside us from out of nowhere, her words startling me back to the cold, dull room.
 “They’re coming in.” Chevelle leaned back, his fingers brushing my collarbone when he pulled away.
 I bit my lip at the tingle that ran through me, and the corner of his mouth turned up into a different kind of smile.
 He stood to walk from the room and I stared at the stone entry, struggling to keep my thoughts from spinning out of control.

With an eager stride, Van’dret climbed up the stairs to the rooftop solar of the Guild Dealer Taiga’s tower fortress...
 He was excited by the honor to dine with the great Immortalist.
 He followed a servant dressed in expensive silks of a drab brown color through the well lit passageways and stairs, all the while nervously straightening his own expensive wardrobe.
 As they approached the top of the tower, the servant silently stepped aside and, with an open palm, waived Van’dret forward.
 The top of the stairs had a small platform where two massive Immortal Guards stood.
 At first they showed no signs of movement, though Van’dret could feel their eyes on him as they weighed his right to enter the private solar of their master.
 In their full plate Night Bronze, the two guardsmen who stood perfectly still at full attention looked to be more statues than actual men, and something that was not beyond the magic of the man was whose door they guarded.
 The double doors leading to the private solar were also of Night Bronze, however the door was covered in intricate wards and symbols.
 The guardsmen's armor was less decorated and held only an engraving of their sigil animals.
 The guard on the right had an engraving on his Pauldrons, the piece of armor that protects his shoulders of the Celestial beast know as The Stag while the man on the left had an engraving of The Mastiff.

But a half mile or so later, I came upon a suitable hollow in a low embankment guarded by the curling roots of a sycamore.
 It wasn’t a bad start, but I gathered some shrubbery to cover the entryway, the bitter stench of its sharp green leaves giving me a little more security—or at least the feeling of it.
 The sun hadn’t set when I’d finished lining the floor with vines, but I went ahead and settled in, sitting so I could see through an opening in the frond-covered entry.
 It was quiet, harder to fight the thoughts that were trying to creep in.
 I began to run songs through my head for distraction, mangling the lyrics and humming through the parts I couldn’t remember at all.
 My fingers tapped soundlessly into the dirt, until a flicker of movement just outside stopped me.
 I held my breath for what I was sure was impending, and painful, death, and saw it again.
 I released the breath, which was not, in fact, my last.
 A soft white rabbit loped in front of the bushes I’d posted for a doorway.
 My stomach was interested, but I’d never prepared meat.

“Settled then,” Aurelia said.
 “You two are going to have to play along when we get there, though.” She glanced at the sky, which was still speckled with stars even though dawn fast approached.
 “We’ll wait until morning.
 I could use a bit more sleep.”
 She walked away, cast a levitation spell upon herself, and then settled in for sleep hovering an inch above the grass.
 “Odd girl,” Qurrah whispered.
 Harruq forced a laugh.
 To Qurrah’s eyes, he looked exhausted, and the shrinking of his muscles was glaring.
 “I’m sorry I left you there at Woodhaven,” Harruq said.
 “And I’m sorry you were alone when Velixar died.

 "Good idea."
 She sprayed the car, but no rainbow appeared, so she adjusted the nozzle to make a wider spray.
 Inspired by the fine drops that shot out, she pointed the nozzle straight into the air.
 "Rain!"
 "Hey!"
 Rick backed out of the spray.
 Laughing, Marie pointed the water at him.

I cursed the formal dress I’d been dragging as it snagged on a low-lying thicket, flinging another string of beads into the soft dirt.
 I considered dumping it, but didn’t think it was the best idea to be sneaking around the forest unclothed.
 After crossing a few soggy patches of moss, the hem was damp and darkened.
 I might have ripped some of the excess material off, but Chevelle’s movement wasn’t leaving me time for that.
 Finally, just before nightfall, he approached a small village.
 It didn’t look like more than half a dozen structures scattered against the base of a large hill.
 He dropped the simple pack he’d been carrying beside a tree and hunched down as he slowed his pace.
 The stance mirrored mine, and gave me pause.
 He was sneaking into this village.
 I watched as he crept around the back of a small hut, knowing that if he was hiding, I definitely didn’t want to get caught here.

 Still, I love my father very much.

 Reluctantly he took the ring, pocketing it as he watched her rise and head for the bathroom.
 She didn't know what he did—that she could go home tomorrow.
 She'd calm down, and then things would go back to normal.
 Eventually she'd accept that her life was here now.
 She'd have to accept it.

 Marie wanted to make Rick a special meal that evening.
 She felt terrible for having rejected his proposal.
 She looked through the two recipe books he'd bought her but couldn't find anything that appealed to her.

“More dead for his army,” Qurrah surmised.
 “No,” Harruq said.
 “With you.”
 Qurrah nodded, knowing he disrespected his brother to think he might not have noticed.
 “He wanted my name,” Qurrah said.
 “I did not give it.
 I have served a master once.
 I will not do so again.”
 Harruq frowned but said no more.
 Together they climbed down from the wall and returned home.

No longer can non-combatants sit quietly on the sidelines or work productively undisturbed.
 War both between and within states has come to involve and affect all of society.
 Infrastructure and production facilities have become a principal target of military action.
 Food supplies are frequently the first major casualty and most lethal weapon.
 A single explosion can paralyze a major metropolis or contaminate an entire region with toxic material, dwarfing the devastation caused by the industrial accidents at Chernobyl and Bhopal.
 The disruption of trade resulting even from regional conflicts such as the Gulf War or the war in Bosnia, impacts not only on the economies of the belligerents, but also on neighbours, trading partners and global economic performance.
 Neither the victor nor the victim can any longer afford to resolve conflicts violently.
 Political states may still be able to survive wars, but developmental achievements can not.
 So long as the benefits of development are confined to one or a few sections of society, the costs of militarization and war may not prevent economic and social progress.
 But when the need is to fulfil the rising expectations of the masses by extending the benefits of development to the entire society – thus enabling the society as a whole to move to the next higher level of collective affluence and fulfilment – every social resource must be garnered and harnessed for this purpose.

I kept the tears back until the door was shut, and then they came in a hot rush that left me depleted and sore.
 It was like Mom had already forgotten about the other half of our family.
 Chapter 2 The sound of my alarm pulled me from an uneasy sleep, full of dreams where I was running in terror from some unseen horror.
 I couldn't decide whether I was happy to be free of them, or mad I had to get up.
 My radio hadn't been in any of the boxes we'd unpacked last night, so I knew I'd have to get ready in silence.
 I forced myself out of bed regardless.
 Mom wouldn't be in to wake me up; she might not even be home.
 It still wasn't light by the time I finished showering.
 The fact that my body was, at least partly, still on Minnesota time should have helped, but the morning was just as unbearable as normal.
 Fighting back a yawn, I flipped on my bedroom light and examined the half-dozen boxes that might contain my clothes.

Knowing which way they would walk to the office from their auto shop class, around behind the football field, I took that route.
 The teacher was engaged with a carburetor and didn’t notice me trespassing in his class.
 I found Billy and Cliff wearing goggles, huddled over the head to a Chevy, grinding the valves.
 They had decided Mrs. Bole and whatever trouble they were in could wait.
 They had one more valve to grind.
 Then we stepped out into the sunlight.
 While I gave them the news, Cliff kicked gravel with both feet.
 Billy stared at the sky.
 His chin trembled.
 A college boy guarded the parking lot.

Education – both formal and public – is the best means for rapidly communicating and imparting the benefits of integration to the largest numbers of people.
 In order fully to harness cultural potentials for development, we need to understand better the natural process of value formation in society, to discover the circumstances and conditions under which new values are accepted, and the factors that retard or facilitate this process.
 In other words, we need to evolve a theory of value formation which will ultimately enable us to consciously identify and instil values that are most conducive and supportive of a peaceful, prosperous life for all humanity.
 The collective progress of humankind will achieve its maximum velocity when we have discovered how to consciously accelerate the process of values acquisition.
 The role of the UNESCO Commission on Culture and Development can make a valuable contribution to our understanding of this most important issue.
 Strategies for Developing Human Resourcefulness
 The following strategies can be carried out by both govern mental and non-governmental agencies at the national and international level to achieve the goals set forth in this report:
 International level
 1.Shift resources from defence to human resource development: Worldwide, massive investment is needed to improve the quantity and quality of education and training.
 A substantial portion of these resources will have to come from reduced military spending.

We are gratified that ICPF should have assigned UNESCO, as the intellectual arm of the United Nations, a prominent role in its recommended agenda for action, and we reaffirm our commit ment to working with all possible partners in pursuit of the goal of global peace and sustainable human development.
 Federico Mayor Director General UNESCO
 The International Commission on Peace and Food began its work at a time of uncommon opportunities for rapid transition on a global scale to democratic ways of life, freedom of the media, and an independent judiciary; food, literacy, health and jobs for all; and sustainable life styles based on harmony between humankind and nature.
 The end of the Cold War and the consequent shift of expenditure from defence to development, the onset of the Information Age and the organization of information superhighways, the growth of mechanisms for regional cooperation, a renewed faith in the United Nations, and commitment to multilateral negotiations and action all provided new opportunities for achieving global peace and prosperity.
 Rapid progress in the application of science and technology in agriculture, industry, and human health strengthened the hope that the concept of 'food, education, health and employment for all' can be converted from rhetoric into reality, provided the peace dividend can be deployed to achieve these goals.
 ICPF had the advantage of building on the work of earlier independent commissions, particularly those chaired by Willy Brandt, Gro Harlem Brundtland and Julius Nyerere.
 We began our work with the conviction that, as Willy Brandt said, 'the problems created by men can be solved by men'.
 The ancient Indian scripture, Bhagavad Gita, expressed the same sentiment by stressing, 'Whatever man aspires to, that he can accomplish.'
 The achievement of food self-sufficiency by India in a period when famine threatened millions of lives through the power of political will and scientific action in a democratic society illustrates this truth.
 In spite of such uncommon opportunities for a better common present, during the last six years the world has been witness to an escalation of ethnic and mini-conflicts, growing intolerance of diversity, the spread of small arms, an increase in violence starting with violence to oneself through drug addiction and damage to the life support systems of land, water, flora, fauna and the atmosphere.

She wanders idly around the castle, no practice, no duties, no formal gatherings.
 Magic practice, castles, who was this girl?
 I read the entries for hours.
 Ruby must have thought I was sleeping.
 I had no idea what in this journal could be of interest to Chevelle unless he knew the woman, and that kept me reading.
 It continued on—her father’s rigorous schedule, their distaste for her sister—and then the entries got more detailed and frequent.
 Mother has been too ill lately for guests.
 I have not been able to see her.
 The tedium of my duties is getting to me and Father has been relentless with my studies, pushing me harder and harder to strengthen my control.
 My sister has been exploring the mountains.

Eugene – Hey, that’s a good idea, I would never have thought of using a name of a mythological monster.
 Thanks Liz.
 Jim – Most of those names aren’t well known, and the people who do know them would die of laughter rather than of fear.
 Liz – Use a modern monster name then, like King Kong or Dracula or something.
 Eugene – Hey great!
 I know, Godzilla.
 It’s perfect.
 GODZILLA!
 Jim – Godzilla is just a guy in a dinosaur costume.
 You’d do about as well taking the name Barney.

I have not changed the brothers’ actions.
 Instead, I have tried to show a bit more into their thoughts, their hearts, and their souls.
 I have had people call Harruq and Qurrah evil.
 Perhaps you agree.
 Much of what they have done certainly is evil.
 I will not sit here and justify the deaths of children, and to do so would paint me a psychopath and my characters sick beings.
 I view Velixar as sort of a recruiter, the kind of man who’d be right at home at a Nazi rally filling confused kids with bigotry, anger, and murder.
 He is gone, for now anyway, and in The Cost of Betrayal these two brothers will get a chance to live on their own.
 For once Harruq has not only felt regret but done something about it.
 For once Qurrah has seen that the darkness he follows is not the absolute power it claims to be.

Antonil’s sword looped around, thrust forward, and buried deep inside flesh.
 The elf fell, gasping for air from the fatal wound.
 Blood pooled below him.
 Antonil pulled his sword free and saluted him with the blade.
 “Well fought,” he said.
 An arrow clanged against his sword and ricocheted off.
 “A warning for your honor,” said a camouflaged elf as he stepped out from behind a door.
 A second arrow followed the first, thudding against Antonil’s shield.
 “A second out of respect.” He drew a third.
 The guard captain charged, his shield leading.

Chapter 5
 The water war continued with us getting them and them getting us.
 We attacked them with a pool, and they threw water balloons at us while we were on bikes.
 It was pretty simple, but the whole time all I noticed was Seth.
 He wasn’t the same to me anymore; he always had this mask on his face, hiding himself from the rest of us.
 I had to find out what was wrong, and soon.
 “Jazell, are you paying attention?” Emily’s annoyed voice broke my day dreams.
 I snapped back to attention, “Uh yes, I am Emily.

I was used to awaking shaking and scared countless times during the course of a night, but I'd never felt that level of pure, bestial fear.
 I stumbled into the bathroom and flipped on the light, only to groan at how ghastly I looked.
 I was even paler than normal, with dark circles under my eyes that only a crack addict could possibly find attractive.
 A hot shower did a little to make me more presentable, I tried to hide the shadows with some makeup, and then finally gave up after botching the second application, and just put on some mascara and eyeliner.
 The mundane process of getting ready for the day wore away some of the edge to my nightmare.
 It was already starting to seem more like a normal, safe dream.
 I put on jeans and a button-up shirt, and then all but stumbled downstairs with my backpack in hand.
 Sometime during the night Mom had put our message board up on the fridge.
 Went shopping, food in the fridge, don't forget breakfast and lunch.
 See you tonight after school.

His feet came up and his torso was hanging in the void when someone reached over and grabbed his arm.
 I heard a grunt of effort, saw him stop moving, and only then realized it was Ben who'd nearly died.
 In the split second between Ben being gently placed back on the stairs, and everyone starting to breathe again, I followed the arm that'd saved him back to see who the hero was.
 Isaac met my gaze as he let go of Ben and then he looked up at Vincent with a stare that was somehow both calm and challenging at the same time.
 "What are you looking at, freak?"
 It was hard to believe Vincent could be so nonchalant after having almost killed someone.
 It'd been an accident obviously, but still that wasn't the kind of thing you just shook off.
 All of the kids that'd been rushing forward to congratulate Isaac for his heroic save started backing away.
 Anxious to avoid the fight, I tried to move with the crowd, but felt a flash of pain as my abused ankle protested.
 For a second I couldn't think about anything other than the agony.

I tottered and he steadied me, but didn’t move away.
 He leaned closer.
 “You smell… like morning.” I bit my lip, heat rising up my neck, but he lingered, breathing in the scent.
 “Ruby,” I said.
 He looked confused.
 “Soap.” I had been reduced to one-word sentences.
 “Oh.” He nodded, leaning back.
 “She does have a way with potions and such.” “I enjoy the mixing,” Ruby said, startling me again as she entered the house.
 “But not to worry, I keep it contained to elements and minerals, no breeding.
 I leave that to Steed.” She laughed at her own words as she passed us on the way to her room.

“Do you have the strength to heal a few others?
 I think we will lose several more otherwise.” Rodregas could not tell if the healer believed Imeralda’s story or recognized what was going on and was going along with it to save his patients.
 “I would be happy to help them, but I have to do it as privately as possible,” said Imeralda.
 The healer did not seem to take the odd request as being unusual and simply stepped away after leading them to two more patients.
 The healer thanked Imeralda for her healing work and the three were heading out the door when a frail voice called out, “Rodregas, may I speak to you?” Rodregas turned around and noticed for the first time the tall shapely form of Karun who had defeated him with sword and shield.
 She had propped herself up now on the bed and waved them over.
 Her arm was clearly broken and her side was bandaged.
 She looked bad, but her complexion looked good and he did not think her seriously hurt.
 His heart froze though at her quiet whisper.
 “You share a minor sigil very freely for being in the great Cathedral itself,” her voice was but a whisper, her eyes more curious then challenging.

 “Do we have any mages with us?” Antonil asked.
 Sergan shook his head, flinching as an arrow aimed straight for his eye bounced away, its shaft broken.
 The guard captain nodded, raised high his sword, and then turned to his army.
 “Stay calm, and do not move from where you stand!” he shouted.
 The men quieted and listened to their commander.
 “I do not know what blessing we have received, but when it ends…”
 His voice drifted off.
 Movement behind his army caught his eye.
 He shoved a few men aside, tore through the center of his army, and then emerged at the back.

“Fine,” the leader said.
 “Go and get whatever the abyss you can carry.”
 Harruq climbed into the shed, throwing Qurrah a worried look before he did.
 When he came out holding his sheathed swords to his chest, the guards tensed, readying their weapons.
 “Drop those right now,” they ordered him.
 Harruq clutched them tight, and the look on his face was clear.
 He would fight, and die, before he gave them up.
 The lead guard, already having their coin as well as the bonus of having found elves in hiding, was willing to let it slide.
 “You draw them, even fiddle with them in their sheaths, you die, that clear?” he told the half-orc.

I need it.
 You must give it to me.”
 Harruq crossed his arms and stared into the corner.
 “People die every day here,” he said.
 “Shall I find their bodies and bring them to you?”
 “For now,” Qurrah said.
 “Yes.
 If the death is fresh, the power should still linger.”
 Harruq reached out, grabbed his brother’s wrist, and clasped his hands in his.
 “I won’t like it,” he said.

What is the responsibility of the international community for preventing or alleviating crises within societies?
 What should be the limits placed on international involvement in the internal affairs of countries that, at least momentarily, are unable to help themselves?
 The sanctity of the sovereign state, like the sanctity of private property in a capitalist society, is a fundamental principle of the nation state system on which the present world community is based.
 Like the protectors of private property, the guardians of the sovereign state vigorously resist each attempt to limit its scope or qualify its power – although in both instances there are obvious and well-recognized limits and qualifications.
 The sensitivity over the issue of sovereignty – especially among former colonies and victims of imperialist aggression – is quite understandable in view of the fact that the emergence of modern nation states over the last two centuries occurred during a period when imperialist wars and colonial conquests were accepted as part of the normal conduct of international relations.
 It is a measure of the world’s progress in this century that this standard of conduct is no longer tolerated by the international community.
 The formulation of current policy on racial memories of past exploitation or persecution is no more appropriate or conducive to human progress, however, than the false conception of policies based on an exaggerated sense of pride or egocentric self-importance derived from the glory of forceful conquest in the past.
 In both instances, attitudes of the past must give way to fresh attitudes oriented to the future.
 Some member states are understandably wary of raising these issues, out of concern that their re-examination could become an excuse for outright political interference in the internal affairs of sovereign nations, a concern which is reinforced by the non-representative character and lack of impartiality of the Security Council.
 Other nations are reluctant to assume the greater responsibilities that a clearly enunciated doctrine might impose on them.

Anger swelled in me.
 I wasn’t sure if I had given it to Chevelle because I’d trusted him, or because he was my captor, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of betrayal.
 I couldn’t fathom why he would be giving my family heirloom to this woman.
 The ruby had been in the vault with my mother’s possessions, along with the map that had brought us here, and now he was giving this Ruby my ruby.
 I shook my head; there must be a connection, some reason it would end here.
 Ruby drew a package from her cape and handed it to Chevelle, smiling a temptress’s smile.
 It was about two hands in size, wrapped in light brown cloth.
 He slid it under his cloak and it disappeared from my view.
 I couldn’t imagine what she had given him, but it must have been in trade for my stone.
 As I peered through the gap in the doorframe, the stranger’s eyes flicked to mine and I was sure she somehow saw me.

 The leader rammed his fist into the half-orc’s face.
 Harruq staggered but held his ground.
 Blood ran down his face, and he spat some away from his mouth.
 He waited for another punch, but nothing came.
 The man was staring in total disbelief at the weapon he held.
 As he had stepped closer to punch, the gem at the end had shimmered a soft green.
 “Of all the dumb luck,” he said, a grin spreading across his face.

 In fact, I believe you'll find the smaller one quite satisfactory.

 There were more turns than I had any hope of ever remembering, but eventually we made it to a familiar-looking door.
 At a nod from Donovan I pushed it open, and then as the furnishings registered, I turned back around.
 "This is Alec's room.
 I couldn't possibly..." Donovan shook his head.
 "Young Mr. Graves instructed that you were to have every convenience.
 I'm sure that included access to what we all jokingly call the second library.

As he looked over, Rodregas saw that Junnit and Dale had re-bound the AElf maiden with iron and replaced her gag so that she could not use magic on them.
 While they guarded her they also kept her at a distance as if she was somehow strange now.
 To them she was supposed to have been consumed by the ritual, and they seemed a little put off to have the AElf maiden standing there.
 Both were watching their prisoner but also throwing quick concerned looks over to where Rodregas now crouched on the tower roof.
 Captain Poir looked hesitant but then nodded.
 He walked over to the table and gathered up the robes.
 “Damn, Rodregas thought” he had said “please.” Master Ravenhurr ordered something done; he did not say “please” to his guard captain.
 As Rodregas stood, Captain Poir held the robe open and he clumsily put it on.
 His movements were awkward in this new larger body.
 His angle was wrong, Rodregas felt like he was standing on a crate.

Steve and his girlfriend, Ashley were highly addicted to Oxy and their combined drug habit made it necessary for him to continue to deal Oxy to the bigger buyers while tossing a few small fish to the officers to appease them and satisfy his deal.
 The officers knew too that Steve was beating his girlfriend and forcing her to perform “happy ending massages” and sexual favors to support her personal addiction to Oxy.
 Brandon was one of the small fish that Steve provided information on.
 Brandon had become so addicted that he could no longer supply the drug in quantity because he and Tiffanie consumed over $1000 a day by snorting or smoking it.
 Brandon had gone from a large dealer to a junkie who would do anything, say anything and sell anything to get his next fix.
 Brandon had become dispensable to Steve and the other large dealers, as he was now an Oxy addicted con man in constant search of his next dose of this potent drug.
 Brandon could trade prison for setting up the double-crosser Steve.
 Officer White was insistent that the time frame for this deal was short.
 Brandon was very ill detoxing, and the fact that he had been busted and he was on lockdown at his parents’ house was common knowledge on the street.
 There’s no easy way to bluff if everyone sees your cards.

Qurrah laughed.
 “You’ll find plenty who’ll teach you how to die by one,” he said.
 “I’m not sure about the other way around.”
 Harruq shrugged.
 His mind kept replaying the fight with the orc.
 Untrained and unprepared, he had still won.
 What could he accomplish with training?
 How many might fear him if he had skill to match his strength and steel to match his anger?
 “I know of a way,” Qurrah said, pulling at one of many loose strands of his robes.
 “A way for you to practice.

“And, if you ask nicely, I will even leave you a few supplies to get to the nearest town if you promise not to tell anyone that you saw me.
 And you will promise that in the name of the All-Father, or you will die at my hand.” Rodregas did not smile now, nor did they.
 “So you think you could kill all of us?
 Put your sword down now!” demanded Audrian.
 Rodregas stepped forward and buried just the tip of his right-handed short sword into Audrian’s chest, hitting the ribs but not shoving the blade through.
 Audrian gasped in surprise and fell back.
 “Swear you will keep my secret and you live, do not and you die.
 Choose!” Audrian just stood there looking at him.
 Then he nodded and said, “In the name of the All-Father, Lord of Sky and Earth and Water, I swear that I will keep your secrets.” Rodregas nodded and relaxed slightly; few would dare break a promise to the All-Father.
 Rodregas decided that Brit and Geor were like pale shadows as they quickly followed suit.

“I am sorry,” was all he said before handing Harruq his weapons.
 “Get ready.
 When the fighting begins you will forget all about her.”

And to Qurrah.”
 “I would have it no other way,” Velixar said.
 A hand touched his forehead.
 All the anger that had raged inside Harruq roared like a fire suddenly loosed upon a dry forest.
 Sweat poured from his skin.
 His head jerked upward, his eyes soaking in the white of Velixar’s hand and the dim glow of the stars.
 Power flowed into him, his muscles stretching and tightening in a chaotic manner.
 “Rise, Harruq Tun,” Velixar said.
 “Revel in the power of Karak.”
 “By the gods, brother, if you could see yourself,” Qurrah said, his voice full of shock and wonder.

She smiled at Harruq, and then nodded to his brother.
 “Care to introduce me?”
 “Oh yeah, this is—”
 “Qurrah Tun, my lady,” Qurrah said with a bow that sent Harruq’s jaw dropping.

A loud crack from beside us made me jump.
 Alec looked at the branch, easily as thick as my arm, which he'd just torn from the tree we were leaning against.
 He stopped shaking as he considered what he'd done to the poor tree.
 "You're saying that because you're worried for me?
 Not because you really want to go back to him?"
 I shook my head, as confused by his reaction, by how close he'd come to losing control, as I was by my not having felt threatened.
 "No, I want to stay, but how can I knowing it will mean you're going to be fighting to the death?"
 Alec tossed the branch away with a sigh.
 "I've spent years learning control, but sometimes I still forget just how breakable everything around me is.
 If you go back to Brandon, you support his claim that you belong to him, and I'd still be forced to challenge him.

My Uncle Dan would take us there at night to visit her and she could sometimes sneak us some food.
 We would watch her roller-skating from car to car and back inside to retrieve her food orders.
 Uncle Dan was a hero to us as he was the only consistent male figure in our life.
 The drive up stations at Bob’s Big Boy were filled with a variety of Hot Rods and they were in all shapes, colors and sizes.
 The engines revved and the tires squealed consistently as the parade of cars cruised through.
 It was an exciting place and a formative moment for both Thomas and me, and helped to cement our lifelong love of muscle cars.
 We were so proud of our mother and we loved to tell our friends where she worked.
 Our friends would openly wonder why a mother would be working at all.
 It was very unusual in that time period not to have a father.
 Our friends were puzzled by our missing parent, our working mother, and our home with our grandparents.

Then, no matter how valiant the efforts of healer Durien, he barely kept you two from death’s door.” “So what did I do?” she asked them.
 “I nearly ran myself to exhaustion fetching Jordaan to heal you.
 I was using my own relationship to rescue you, who I have known less than a season.
 And now that all this effort has been done you are going to get mad… mad at the only reason you two are alive to complain at all?
 Well to the Infernal with you.”  With that Imeralda turned and jumped back into the trees.
 The half Nymph’s anger, though not meant to cool the warriors, had that effect as both men stood in shock at Imeralda’s normally calm demeanor.
 Doi’van wilted like a flower without water in the sun; he literally sat down on the ground.
 Rodregas simply sagged as the truth behind the half AElf’s words sank in.
 Jordaan simply stood watching the scene, without his normal expression of cheer.
 Finally Rodregas turned to Jordaan and said, “Imeralda is right and I apologize for our anger.

Translucent silver crept about the wraps.
 Blue smoke floated into the air.
 The blue and silver grew thicker and thicker.
 Qurrah’s words grew louder, more powerful, and then Ahrqur’s spirit ripped into the air, a glowing blue-silver form of insanity.
 The spirit looked much as he did in life, except his clothes were different.
 They were silvery robes, beautiful and decadent.
 The spirit wailed.
 It took all of Harruq’s strength to resist the urge to cover his ears.
 “Cease such nonsense,” Qurrah ordered.
 The spirit immediately hushed.

Maybe it wouldn’t work, but I could try.
 I wasn’t sure I felt anything, but after a few minutes I imagined my right hand might have tingled a little.
 I grabbed a close volume and leafed through it.
 It was a legacy of the Viridian Forest clan.
 I pulled another volume down.
 A diary of Momar the Ancient.
 I sighed.
 This was going to be like trapping a greased pixie.
 I sat for hours exploring the early texts, stories of the river clans and their battles with the Imps of Long Forgotten, firsthand accounts of the Trials of Istanna, and the long lineages of the eldest families.
 A whisper roused me from my studies and I realized it was late, so I decided to give up and start again the next day.

We sat by the fireplace and cooked meals together in this tiny motel kitchen.
 We hiked one day through the forest and climbed a small mountain where we stood together and looked out at the beauty of the nature that surrounded us.
 When your children are young you have many special moments and they pass by so fast because they are so frequent.
 People always warn you how fast your children will grow and one day it happens and you realize that you were warned.
 When your children get old enough to move out of your home, you have very few opportunities to have special family moments and that makes them even more wonderful.
 We returned to our home after the trip and we went to bed late that night.
 I woke that morning before my wife and my sons.
 I brewed my morning coffee and I walked into Brandon’s room.
 I woke Brandon and I handed him one of the drug tests we still had from our failed attempt to rehabilitate him.
 It wasn’t because I didn’t trust him--it was because I did.

I can't be blamed for just trying to keep my head down and survive.
 We were already pulling into the parking lot.
 He must have been driving even faster than normal.
 That should have triggered another panic attack, but the tension in the black Mustang was high enough to distract my subconscious for now.
 Brandon smoothly pulled the bulky car in between a pair of SUVs and cut the engine before turning and hitting me with the full force of his gray eyes.

His arms whipped around her.
 "Then don't leave me."
 She looked up at him, her eyes filling with tears.
 "I have to.

 They stayed locked in each other's arms, her tears soaking into his shirt, his tears dripping into her hair.
 At last, Rick, feeling weak and shaky, took Marie's hand and led her to the living room.
 They sat down on the sofa, and he drew her close.
 "I love you more than anything in the world," he whispered into her hair.

The staff whirled around him a blur, and the length of the weapon made full use of his height and size.
 But he also had complete control of the weapon as he highlighted that morning by whizzing past Rodregas’ clumsy blocks and bruising every part of his body until even the smallest movement hurt.
 Rodregas was used to being better trained than others, but with the staff he was starting from scratch; even holding it properly was new to him.
 Doi’van showed him to keep one hand at the center of the staff and one hand between the center and the end.
 One always gripped the staff in thirds.
 When it was held horizontally in front, the right palm faced away from the body and the left hand faced the body, enabling the staff to rotate.
 The power for generated strikes was held by the backhand pulling the staff, while the front hand was used for guidance.
 When striking the wrist is twisted, the same as when one turned the hand over when punching.
 Rodregas’ eyes were quickly opened to the weapon and it was fun to learn something so new, but he was much worse for the lesson.
 After lunch he limped over to the great oak which they sat under most days for their magical training and reading.

Britney caught me registering the fact she was driving under the speed limit for the first time I could remember, and broke off recounting Amy Stevens' supposed fling with one of the football players just long enough to blush.
 "I figured I should be more careful of how fast I drive.
 You know, my dad keeps threatening to take away my car if I get any more tickets.
 With everything else going on right now he just might do it."
 It was actually pretty plausible.
 I probably would've believed it if not for Rachel's description of the new rumor floating around school.
 Britney was trying to cater to my supposed fear of being in a speeding car.
 Only, my supposed fear was actually a very real fear, just not for the reasons Britney thought.
 Chapter 11 Brandon arrived just in time to pick me up before I got on the bus.
 As expected, he teased me about not waiting for him at my house, but it was a small price to pay for not having to worry about how I was going to get to school if he didn't show up.

 It was hard to believe what I was watching was anything less than an all-out bid to kill each other.
 Isaac ducked a vicious swipe from James, and then knocked the smaller hybrid over with a backhand blow I was pretty sure would've crushed rock.
 Dominic winced a little as the blow landed and her boyfriend hit with earth-shattering force.
 "Are you sure?
 I mean, it looks pretty real to me."
 "They're definitely being careful not to kill each other.
 Isaac could've connected with his claws instead of his fist."
 Jasmin and Jessica were circling each other now.

“Which way do we go?” Harruq asked.
 “Follow me,” Qurrah said.
 The two rushed past the elaborate elven homes toward the sound of combat.
 They kept to the back alleys, and because of this, they met their first target: three elves fleeing toward them, hoping to use the lesser-known pathways to avoid the overwhelming numbers of their opponent.
 “Bring them down,” the necromancer said.
 “With pleasure,” Harruq said.
 He raised his blades and charged.
 The closest elf realized the half-orc was an enemy and cried warning before rushing ahead, his longsword ready.
 “Come on, pansy-boy,” the half-orc warrior roared.
 The two collided in a brutal exchange of steel.

There wasn't really any bitterness in her voice, but there was something, maybe the same kind of longing I felt when I talked about Prom.
 "You're probably right.
 That would fit with what I know of Britney so far."
 "Do you need us to give you a ride?"
 I looked over and saw that James was once again glaring at me, somehow having approached to within a few feet without making any noise.
 "I should probably make sure she isn't waiting somewhere for me.
 That's probably half of why she's so mad.
 I was so out of things yesterday I didn't think to let her know I was headed home with you."
 Rachel looked for a moment like she wanted to disagree, but she nodded, in the kind of noncommittal way people use when they don't really agree, but are ready to let you make your own mistakes.
 Rachel pulled her books together, and then followed me through the door, James two steps behind, and looking, amazingly enough, even more surly than he had a few seconds before.

 "Thanks for telling me about Les Misérables.
 I mean, I should have said thanks yesterday, but I really do appreciate you thinking of me.
 It was really nice."
 Rachel's eyes lit up brighter than I'd seen them in a while.
 "You're welcome.

I felt myself tense up in worry, but he waved my worries away.
 "In answer to the core of your question, Jasmin thinks it's because I've finally gone over the edge, that in essence I've snapped due to the stress, and this, 'obsession,' as she terms it, is merely a novel way of committing suicide."
 My heart started racing again, but he wasn't done.
 "The other school of thought is that I'm more of a healer than anyone realized, and that I couldn't resist your obvious need."
 He'd lost me there.
 "Wait, what do you mean?"
 Alec paused for several seconds before answering.
 "You glow.
 All of the time.

I felt like a complete coward, but I wasn't willing to go back there.
 I rationalized it by saying there wasn't enough time before the bell rang, but I was really just scared.
 Britney gave me a questioning glance from across the room, but I just shook my head.
 I couldn't tell anyone about what'd happened.
 Not yet at least.
 Mrs. Campbell obviously knew something was wrong, but as soon as class ended I dodged out of the room and headed towards the relative safety of the lunchroom.
 Britney's proclivity towards gossip was a complete godsend when you wanted to find out information about someone.
 "Jasmin?
 I don't know, people don't say very much about her.
 She's got an incredible temper though."

You don't know how to get back home, anyway.
 Just trust me a little."
 She didn't want to.
 But he was right--she didn't know how to get home.
 Slowly she rose, not taking the hand he extended but following him inside.
 "This is a microwave oven," he told her, patting a white and brown box.
 "It cooks things really fast--it can heat something like rice in less than a minute."
 When he saw her incredulous stare, he opened the refrigerator and took out a bowl of mixed vegetables.
 "Feel."
 She touched the cold food.

I was completely ignorant of where I was.
 I had apparently lost part of my memories and magic because I had been bound, was still bound.
 I realized Chevelle was watching me, waiting for the stone.
 Shaking free of the thoughts, I removed the pouch from my pack to untie the lacing.
 I reached inside, wondering momentarily what else might be written in the ancient language on the scroll.
 I handed the dark red stone to Chevelle, who only nodded as he took it from me, not examining it before he slipped it into a pocket to hide it away.
 There was a sound at the door and his fingers slid over my lower back, urging me into my room.
 I was closed in just as the main door opened, giving me no more than a glimpse of deep red curls.
 I tried not to be annoyed about being closed in a room.
 I was a prisoner after all.

Jim – And let me guess, a good kisser.
 Eugene – We never actually got to the kissing point of the relationship.
 Johnny – I didn’t want to know that!
 Jim – And that’s why it’s so damned funny.
 Besides, you’ll need some knowledge about such things if you ever manage to talk some girl into spending time with you.
 Johnny – Well, so what if I haven’t been out with a woman yet…
 Jim – You scare them Johnny.
 In fact you make most people uncomfortable.

Everyone from Jagger—who copped his singing style—to The Animals to Jimmy Page have accorded him a special place in their learning.
 And I knew him, man.
 Knew him as teacher/mentor/friend.
 It was as if I’d been sanctified.
 Another father.
 He taught me “Don’t Let the Sun Pull Your Pants Down,” “Piggly Wiggly Blues,” “She Caught the Katy,” “Her Ass Moves I Moan.”  Underground stuff, stuff from the adult’s table, from the back room.
 And I lapped it up.
 And Tennessee paid me the high compliment, man.

She hoped they died instantly, but she knew better.
 They had suffered tremendously.
 “You monster,” she shouted.
 “What meaning does this battle hold to you?”
 “Everything,” Velixar shouted, hurling a flaming ball of fire from each hand.
 “I desire panic and bloodshed all across the east!”
 Aurelia summoned a magical shield about her body.
 The fireballs thudded three feet from her body and detonated.
 The two nearest buildings crumpled, their walls and roofs blown back by the power.
 The elf winced, nearly knocked to her knees by the force.

They went over the alphabet several times until Harruq could repeat most without thinking too hard.
 “I want you to take it home with you,” she said when they were done.
 To her annoyance, Harruq refused to accept the book.
 “I really don’t want to take it,” he said.
 “Why not?”
 “Well I, just…” His face turned a mixture of gray and red.
 “Qurrah doesn’t know I’m doing this.”
 Aurelia sighed and set the book down beside her.
 “Why don’t you tell him about me?

Information promotes political freedom, economic development and social justice.
 The transforming power of information under glasnost opened up Soviet society to events in the outer world and created widespread awareness of the alternative approaches and achievements of other nations.
 Information brought down the Berlin Wall, ended the Cold War and ushered the world into a new era.
 Information about economic opportunities and potentials is an essential ingredient, a catalyst, of the development process.
 In the past, development strategies have tended to place too little emphasis on the power of public awareness to release people’s energies and initiative on a massive scale.
 The vast accumulation of knowledge and new technology for rapid dissemination of information that the world possesses today can be utilized to increase the speed of change, eliminate many false starts and wrong turns and much unnecessary suffering.
 The goals and strategies recommended in this report aim to accelerate the process of political, social and economic development by creating greater public awareness of desirable and achievable objectives and releasing the initiative of individuals and institutions to pursue them more vigorously.
 Information is the most powerful catalyst for this process.
 The speed and extent of knowledge transfer are far from optimal between and within nations – even within industrially advanced nations – due to lack of information, out-dated attitudes and beliefs, lingering superstitions, and conventional wisdom.
 Ignorance and scepticism about new opportunities are characteristic of development at each stage and in every field of activity.

He'd desperately wanted to keep her with him, to marry her, and he could have kept his discovery to himself and never told her he knew how to help her get home.
 But he'd wanted what was best for her.
 Hanging the housedress in the closet again, she stripped off her dress and extra set of underwear and put on Rick's t-shirt.
 Curling up on the bed, she stroked one sleeve.
 She wondered what Rick was doing right now.
 Had he gone to work?
 She suspected that he'd been too upset to work.
 He'd probably sat in the garden until he'd known for sure she was gone.
 He might even still be there, hoping she hadn't gone back, that she was lost somewhere in 2011 and would eventually call out to him to come find her.
 Tears began to run down her cheeks.

Marie's eyes widened, but then she turned her face away.
 "Yes."
 Her mother nodded.
 "When I was 17, I met a young man named Andrew.
 I was staying with my aunt on Martha's Vineyard for the summer, and his family had a cottage not far from my aunt's.
 He was a student at Harvard during the year, and he was planning to be a doctor.
 We were inseparable from the moment we met.
 We went out to dinner, went to parties, sometimes just sat quietly reading together.
 But best of all, we would walk or sit on the beach for hours talking.
 He was wonderful, and I loved him with all my heart."

My headshake seemed to unnerve him a little more.
 Presumably he was having a hard time believing in a world where people didn't have fixed schedules, where moms didn't let their daughters know when they'd be back from their outings.
 "The message really is quite urgent.
 Are you positive you don't have a way to contact her?
 Well then, I suppose I've no choice."
 Most people say they don't have a choice rather flippantly, but he seemed rather more like he had his back against the wall than I expected.
 "You know, I presume, that there was some confusion regarding the tourism project she bid out for the city?
 Well, I've managed to get to the bottom of the situation and it appears we did indeed award the contract to her."
 The news seemed too good to be true.
 "You mean she's got the job?"

Brandon told me that the easiest way to buy pills is from people who are prescribed them for chronic pain and intentionally demand more than they need from their doctors so they can resell them at an enormous profit.
 Brandon told me that the Holy Grail for an Oxy dealer was to find an “old guy with a script” (prescription); so I decided this would be who I would become.
 I went to a Wal-Mart and purchased a pre-paid cellular phone that I would use as my undercover phone.
 I didn’t need my last name popping up on a caller I.D.
 I nicknamed the phone my “crack-berry.” After getting crucial information and doing a bit of research, I found the Craigslist classified advertisement with a picture of a young blond girl offering massages with a contact phone number that matched the drug dealer Steve’s number.
 The pictures in the ad were racy and the price per session was about twice the normal cost for such services.
 I called to set up a “massage.” I told her I got massages often for my ailing back but I thought it would be fun to get a massage from a pretty young lady.
 We scheduled an appointment for later that same day.
 I’ve had back problems in the past, as many 50 year olds do, so I dug up a back support and I wore it to the appointment.
 I had a basic plan and an obvious goal but how it would unfold was a mystery.

The vast inequalities in living standards that persist within both developing and industrial nations, and between the most and least economically developed countries, result in an enormous global loss of incomes and jobs.
 Accelera ting the development of poorer nations and poorer sections of the population in each country is the most powerful instrument and the surest guarantee of continued growth of jobs and incomes for everyone in the next century.
 Strategies for Developing Countries
 For the developing countries as a whole, the most critical question is how to create quickly hundreds of millions of jobs for the poor with limited purchasing power and limited capital for investment.
 The idea that most of these jobs could be created in the corporate sector or by government-sponsored activities has been put to rest.
 Currently, there are nearly one billion self-employed and unpaid family workers in the world, most of them self-employed farmers in developing countries.
 The self-employed represent 48 per cent of the workforce in low-income economies (less than $500 per capita GDP).
 For any strategy to be successful, it must give central importance to self-employment and entrepreneurship, with emphasis on agriculture, agro-industry and small firms in the informal sector.
 While a single approach will not be applicable to countries and regions of the world in different stages of development, a number of common principles and strategies are widely applicable.
 Agriculture as an engine

Illustrations and descriptions matched what I had seen.
 I know I took a risk extending Rune’s spell further, but I did not want to get caught, definitely not followed.
 I wondered if my sister was still at the original camp.
 Surely she wasn’t bright enough to figure it out.
 And apparently she wasn’t willing to tell anyone.
 I was returning to the spot I had found the humans the previous day when I ran across one of them alone.
 I hid myself behind a patch of brush to watch him.
 He had a lovely complexion with a hint of bronze and cropped dark brown hair with a few tiny streaks of blond just around his face.
 He looked less like the others I had been watching.
 He was built like the elves, strong and muscled, but still lean.

For a second I was torn between complimenting her on it and asking her what cielos meant.
 I finally just settled on faking a smile and thanking her.
 She smiled at me.
 "No need to thank me.
 My name is Dominic by the way."
 A few seconds later I was standing alone, nervously facing my house.
 Alec suddenly appeared at my side.
 I jumped a little at the surprise.
 "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."
 I shrugged as my breathing started to slow down again.

 She sighed and leaned back.

He simply rode as he always did, with intermittent glances in each direction, as if I weren’t even there.
 In truth, he hadn’t appeared to notice my behavior at all.
 When I finally broke the silence, we were navigating a narrow pass.
 “How long will we be riding?” I wasn’t specific in my question, not wanting to reveal I had no idea where we were headed.
 If he’d been under the false impression he’d had to take me, I wasn’t about to mess that up only to be dragged back to the village.
 Especially after everything that had happened.
 My horse quickened his pace to ride alongside his and I made a mental note to learn how to control the horse on my own.
 The constricted path forced us close together, our stirrups and legs brushing as we rode.
 Chevelle nodded at my hand and I held it out, palm up.
 Chevelle indicated a spot on one of the mountains.

It was not just adrenaline that caused Harruq’s hands to shake, but Qurrah put his hand on his wrist and begged him to calm.
 “Never forget this shame,” he said.
 “Let it burn in you.
 Let it be a reminder of what I have always said.
 We are better, superior.
 Never feel guilt at what we do to them, for you see what they would do to us.”
 Harruq stood, brushed some dirt from his pants, and then offered Qurrah a hand.
 Together they trudged west, without food, water, or blankets.
 The guards watched them go, smirking all the while.

“The wolves are out there.” Each person in the room turned to me.
 Ruby finally spoke.
 “What do you know about the wolves, Frey?” “Are they hurt?” “We don’t know.
 They did not return.” “Rhys and Rider?” “They are attempting to locate them.
 They will not rejoin us until they do.” I started to draw a map for them with magic and then cursed when I realized I was no longer able.

 Ruby had been right to drug me; I didn’t think I could have handled it otherwise.
 They were watching me, unsure what I was doing as I sat helpless and swearing.
 “I need something to draw with.” Ruby pulled a piece of charcoal and scrap of paper from her bags.
 I rushed to sketch the path I remembered from my dream, focusing on the ring of trees with the most detail.

So I resort to an English dictionary, look up "adore" and all I find are synonyms: worship; revere, venerate; and one somewhat helpful description: deep, rapturous love.
 That one rings truest.
 According to my vocabulary, if we adore something, we are drawn to it and resist separation.
 Its presence comforts, inspires, provides us with hope and meaning.
 The thought of losing it may terrify or leave us in despair.
 I feel all that about my kids.
 I have felt somewhat the same about a few others, at least for a time.
 But I would be lying if I claimed to feel all that about God.
 My problem invites the question: how can I adore God when I don’t quite know what to make of him?
 I hear and read that he’s a person, and a spirit, who resides everywhere, outside and in us.

When I set out to write Broken, I never expected that I was going to end up writing the same story from Alec's point of view, but I'm pleased with how both Broken and Torn have turned out, both individually and as a combined work.
 They are done in very different styles, but ultimately that was exactly what I was after.
 I think there is plenty of cross-over of guys reading paranormal romance, and girls picking up more action-packed stories.
 Ultimately I think most of us just want a compelling story, but sometimes the labels that get applied to books get in the way of us discovering them, rather than helping as they are meant to do.
 I think one of the things that made the Harry Potter books so successful was the fact that the whole family could share in the series.
 I remember as Twilight came out thinking that there were plenty of guys who would enjoy Twilight if they ever sat down and read it, but most of them wouldn't ever give it a try.
 My hope with Broken and Torn is that the two stories combine into something that both guys and girls can enjoy.
 The girls are likely to start out with Broken, while guys are likely to pick up Torn and enjoy the extra action there.
 Either way, my biggest hope would be that the guys can introduce their wives and girlfriends to Broken, and the girls can introduce their husbands and boyfriends to Torn.
 We've included excerpts for both Torn and Splintered (the sequel for Broken and Torn) below.

"Any slower and you'd have been cut off from the rest of us by those mutts."
 My confusion must have been obvious.
 Dominic looked up from Jess.
 "Vincent and Cassie cut Jess and Isaac off from the rest of us."
 Rachel leaned in so she could whisper.
 "Jess is terrified of what Vincent and Brandon will do to her if they get a chance.
 She collapsed, and then everyone stormed the area."
 The limo hit a particularly nasty bump, and a wave of pain drove questions about what exactly Brandon had threatened out of my mind.
 I'd never noticed how bad the roads between school and Alec's house were.
 Each jostle sent waves of agony up my leg, and Jess's quiet sobs kept time to my suppressed gasps.

 "Why don't you close your eyes and just think about home?

 She thought about her mother and father and brother and how they'd laughed and talked at meals before her brother had been disowned.
 She thought about Tom and the speakeasy.
 She opened her eyes to see Rick watching her anxiously.

 “What exactly happened?” I questioned.
 Seth glanced at Emily and back at me, “I don’t really know.
 We turned around to see you being mauled by a Thrasher.
 Before either of us could do anything, some light appeared out of nowhere.
 When it died down, we found you lying on the ground unconscious.
 That’s basically it.” “We don’t know what the light was.” Emily added.
 “But whatever it was, it saved your life.” “Uh I have a feeling I should thank it, but I don’t know how you thank light.” I muttered.
 “You thank it like you would thank anyone else,” A voice said.
 I almost jumped to the moon in surprise.

Heat crept into my cheeks for no good reason, and I picked up my pace to the old tree that housed the library.
 I knew my shoulders were drawn in and I was glancing around too often, but I couldn’t seem to help it.
 It felt illicit.
 Twice I imagined a set of dark eyes on me, a pricking sensation running over my spine.
 I was going to have to pull myself together.
 I was being ridiculous.
 At this rate, I’d be fawning and flipping my hair like Evelyn by sundown.
 When I finally walked into the library, I remembered why I didn’t go there to study lineages.
 There must have been a thousand volumes and tenfold more scrolls in the main level alone.
 And I had no magic to lead me in the right direction.

Screams of pain and the sound of clashing of metal on metal flowed into the city.
 Harruq watched an orc wielding two swords cut off the arm of one soldier, and, as the blood from the limb splattered across his face, he turned and decapitated another with two vicious hacks.
 The orc roared in victory only to die as a soldier shoved his sword in his side and out his back.
 “Will they make it through?” Harruq asked, in awe of the display.
 Qurrah glanced over the wall and then back to the main combat.
 Archers continued eviscerating the orc forces.
 If they could push into the city, their arrows would be a nuisance at best, but it seemed they had underestimated the human soldiers.
 “They are running out of time,” Qurrah said.
 “But they might.”
 He glanced back to the necromancer, and then he saw his eyes, just hints of red underneath the hood of his robes.

She teaches fifth grade kids so underprivileged that not one in her last year’s class of twenty-seven had ever participated in an organized sport.
 She loves the kids, so she’s always developing some new method, like creating a bi-weekly newspaper and having them write columns on their favorite subjects or assigning them to design their dream house and using the assignment to teach basic geometry.
 In summer, at the Boy’s and Girl’s Club, she teaches art to teenagers, most of them troubled or in trouble.
 Darcy’s great because her giant’s heart is open and she uses her brains and imagination in generous ways.
 And Cody’s one of those most-rare people who have all the tools.
 He’s strong, smart, industrious, and even handsomer than his dad.
 He’ll graduate with a B.A.
 next year with near-perfect grades and two minors, in Latin and Spanish.
 Still, his greatness, the character trait that makes me hope someday we’ll find a President like him, is his devotion to do whatever is good and right, though it might be the hardest way.
 A question.

Anvil was holding her back, Rune with magic.
 She snapped and they saw her power.
 Some denied the possibility but not my father.
 He has attained his prize, that which he has always coveted.
 I will stop him.
 ~ The plan is forming, but I am unsure whether it will work.
 I know I cannot defeat him, and his guard, alone.
 But I must protect my Freya.
 I must protect us all.
 It is the want of power that will consume us.

It is said that Dire meat makes you strong.
 Not sure if that is true though.” His voice, in contrast to Imeralda’s, sounded completely normal.
 “Don’t you care that he did something so stupid?” asked Imeralda.
 “Well,” Doi’van replied slowly, “the cats are obviously connected to him due to his Celestial lion essence.
 He freed them and now he has found a rich place for them to rear their young if they are pregnant from the mating.
 But with beasts like that, you are either in charge or you are game.
 I think that he probably did the right thing.
 No way to know for sure, but they did not rip him apart, so we will say he was very brave and not very stupid.” Then he added, “Of course, if you had asked me before hand, I would have said that taking food from a Dire Cat was a very stupid idea.” He finished with a smile full of sharp teeth almost a match for the lions and in a casual movement lowered his horned head in what Rodregas thought might be his equivalent of a shrug.
 The next morning they repeated the Morning Prayer and meditation ritual.
 This time while Doi’van joined in, Imeralda mostly watched.

Mrs. Tranton gazed down at her for a moment.
 "I'm sorry, darling."
 She kissed Marie's forehead and left.
 Marie curled up next to Rick's t-shirt still clutching his handkerchief.
 She felt so empty.
 She didn't sleep well that night but woke up early nevertheless.
 After bathing, she put on her emerald underwear and a simple white dress and went out into the garden.
 It didn't look so different from Rick's, she decided.
 They didn't have any white roses like he did, nor an electric fountain, but they had red roses and azaleas, just as he did.
 She wished she'd brought back a picture of him.

Chapter 2 The sound of my alarm pulled me from an uneasy sleep, full of dreams where I was running in terror from some unseen horror.
 I couldn't decide whether I was happy to be free of them, or mad I had to get up.
 My radio hadn't been in any of the boxes we'd unpacked last night, so I knew I'd have to get ready in silence.
 I forced myself out of bed regardless.
 Mom wouldn't be in to wake me up; she might not even be home.
 It still wasn't light by the time I finished showering.
 The fact that my body was, at least partly, still on Minnesota time should have helped, but the morning was just as unbearable as normal.
 Fighting back a yawn, I flipped on my bedroom light and examined the half-dozen boxes that might contain my clothes.
 I debated searching through them all, but it would just mean another fight if I did find them.
 With a sigh of resignation I walked over to the chair where I'd left my selections from the night before, and pulled the faded jeans up my frail-looking legs.

He steals this knighthood from more deserving squires,” Van’dret said.
 At this Rodregas saw many people nodding, but he remained silent.
 It was not his turn to answer any question other than from the Grand Marshal.
 The Marshal Faurrenida voice made his displeasure and his dislike of arguing with a non-knight clear as he said, “While a knight has the full right to enter both the Lesser and Greater Sigil Chambers and take and sigil as his level of magic might allow, it is not a sigil he earns today.
 It is knighthood.
 Now, the discussion is over.” growled Marshal Faurrenida.
 To forestall any further argument, the Grand Marshal stepped forward quickly and drew his sword.
 The sword gleamed of the highest quality blue steel and red fire seemed to run its length.
 Marshal Faurrenida laid the sword on Rodregas’ right shoulder and said, “Squire, you come to us this day.
 Think well and be sure on your decision to swear these oaths.” Faurrenida paused for a second and then slowly added.

I knew it was going to be bad, could feel it in a sickening, only-seconds-away-from-vomiting kind of way, but couldn't follow the chain of logic through to the very end.
 I let Jasmin help me pull my books together, and then numbly followed her out to the hallway.
 Alec and the rest of the pack were waiting for us at my locker.
 Jasmin calmly opened my locker and put my things away while I was still trying to come to terms with everything.
 Alec took my hand.
 "Are you okay?"
 I shook my head.
 "This is going to be really bad, isn't it?"
 His silence validated my belief, probably even more than he realized.
 "I'd...we'd...spare you it if we could."

Jason threw knife after knife, hitting its mark every time.
 When the creature went down, Seth stood and took a breath.
 Then another tackled him to the ground.
 I didn’t know what to do and Jason didn’t either.
 Emily ran forward and pointed to Seth who was clawing toward his weapon.
 “Do something!” she screamed.
 Before I could reply, fire shot from her finger.
 The thrasher yelped and jumped off Seth and ran toward Emily.
 She smiled wickedly and held both hands out, pelting the creature with fire.
 I pulled Seth up in time to see the Thrasher buried entangled by roots shooting from the dirt.

My dirty, ripped jeans and shirt had been replaced with clean clothes that were only a little too small.
 That last fact should have alarmed me more than it did.
 Somehow being stripped down by a stranger paled in comparison to a near-death hallucination involving wolves and a monster straight out of a science fiction movie.
 The bedroom was possibly the nicest room I'd ever been in.
 A movie star or millionaire would have had a hard time topping this place for sheer decadence.
 The walls were paneled in some kind of rare, doubtless expensive imported hardwood.
 The bookcases that covered the majority of the wall space seemed to be made out of the same kind of wood, and were filled with more books than I'd seen in the local bookstore the one time I'd convinced Britney to stop by on our way home after school.
 They were all hardbound, with leather bindings and engraved covers.
 There was a stereo system off in one corner, hooked up to a laptop and some kind of portable music player.
 I had to look around the room twice before I finally spotted the speakers to the system.

The growth of agricultural incomes in developing countries is critically important to global job creation and economic growth.
 The expansion of agricultural exports under the new GATT agreement is likely to exacerbate the falling commodity price syndrome to the great detriment of the entire world economy, unless effective mechanisms are introduced to stabilize international commodity prices.
 Of the many efforts in the past, some were tried and failed, many were proposed but never implemented.
 The recent success of coffee-producing countries in lifting prices from a disastrously low level has been an exception to the rule.
 Collective and coordinated international action is essential to address this problem.
 Despite past failures, new efforts must be made to revive international commodity agreements, preferably covering both producing and consuming countries.
 This will be possible only if developing countries first arrive at a consensus approach among themselves, including the economic costs and benefits, and a financing plan.
 Financing for international commodity stocks could be supplied partly by producer countries in the form of building national stocks under collective supervision.
 Partly, it could come from bank commercial loans against commodity collateral, loans from regional development banks, the World Bank and IMF's Buffer Stock Facility, which has remained almost unused.
 8.Technology transfer: Accelerate transfer of technology to and between developing countries.

He went to take a bottle from a drawer.
 "I'm not as red as I was last Saturday."
 "Do you-do you want me to-to rub some on you?"
 He glanced up, on the verge of asking her why, since it was only his arms, not his back, that needed the lotion.
 Instead, he silently handed her the bottle.
 Marie squeezed some lotion into her hand.
 Starting at his wrist, she rubbed his arm, working her way up.
 When she reached the tan line where his sleeve began, her hands glided up to the red spot just below his neck.
 "You-you must not have put sunscreen here.
 It's really red."

Rodregas had gotten too comfortable with his opponents not being able to match his strength.
 This guard did.
 The Immortal Guard had already launched himself forward and Rodregas’ own speed worked against him.
 As Rodregas’ short sword hit nothing but air, he felt the sharp agony of the guard’s blade piercing his thigh.
 Rodregas used his speed to throw himself back.
 But as he did, he felt another sharp cut hit his upper arm.
 The other men were moving in now that he was off balance.
 Rodregas twisted as he fell and grabbed one of the slavers and brought him down.
 With a quick stab into his groin, Rodregas took the slaver out of commission.
 Rodregas rolled off his squirming body and threw himself up to a standing position.

He had on pajama trousers but no shirt.
 She stared in fascination at his broad chest.
 She'd never seen a half-naked man before.
 "Let me get on some shoes and shorts."
 She waited downstairs for him, anxious about her attempt to get back.
 She'd looked outside and seen that it wasn't very foggy out.
 Would that make it impossible to get back?
 Was it-- "Ready?"
 She jumped.

Apparently I was supposed to have waited?
 I sighed and flipped open my book.
 As I finished up my second assignment for the day, I realized I was parched.
 My trusty water bottle was empty when I reached for it, so I quietly stood and left the room.
 I thought I remembered where the closest drinking fountain was.
 Even so, I planned on getting a little lost before I found it.
 I didn't, however, plan on nearly colliding with Alec as he slowly rounded the corner in front of me.
 The tension of the near-fight earlier had distracted me from just how incredible-looking he was.
 There was no such refuge now.
 For a moment I couldn't think of anything other than how the dark blue of his shirt brought out his tan complexion.

But no problem, you guys have to destroy him now.” She must have seen me shaking because she added, “No pressure.” “No pressure?” I practically squeaked.
 “You just put the fate of both worlds on my shoulders.” “No,” she said, “I put the fate of both worlds on all four of your shoulders.” “Alright, is that all?” I asked, eager to leave.
 June nodded and I turned to open the door.
 I was just about to turn the handle when she said, “Jazell, don’t be scared to bring out your emotions.
 They make you stronger.” I looked over my shoulder to see June standing stiffly.
 “Thanks,” I whispered.
 “Thanks June.” “Good luck, Jazell.” I opened the door and saw that Emily and Jason were also coming out of their rooms.
 Emily looked a little shaken but she gave me a thumbs-up.
 Good luck, June’s voice whispered one more time.
 Yeah, I was going to need it.

 Beside him, Qurrah Tun stood mesmerized by the sight.
 Hundreds of skulls bathed in purple fire sailed over the walls of Veldaren like dark comets.
 Gaping mouths shrieked mindless wails, their voices bone-chilling and unrelenting.
 A few soldiers fired arrows, but most hid behind their shields.

Despite my disbelief, I somehow managed to act quickly, stashing the papers in my shirt before attempting a casual exit to read them at home.
 I made it out of the library and almost to the gate when I noticed a dark figure behind Virden Day’s tree.
 It was Chevelle.
 He was speaking with Virden when he turned his head slowly toward me… and I was staring into his eyes again.
 Oh, give me a break; he’s halfway across the village from you.
 But I was staring.
 Despite my resolve, color rose to my cheeks once more as I turned away.
 I couldn’t understand why he was affecting me this way.
 The pages stuffed in my shirt felt like fire against my skin.
 I quickened my pace, caught my toe on a root, and stumbled.

I didn't know much, but fraud wasn't the kind of thing you associated with a slap on the wrist.
 If the worst happened and Mom was going to serve jail time then we had bigger problems than even what she was admitting to.
 ** It looked like the sun must have set hours ago, but it wasn't really dark.
 The full moon seemed oddly brighter than normal, edging the landscape with a silvery tracing.
 The cool illumination was strangely complemented by the warm tendrils of light trying to escape from the greenery surrounding the area.
 I let my gaze drop, and found an unearthly pool of liquid light at my feet.
 The quiet murmur of falling water to my right kindled a burning thirst I hadn't realized I'd been feeling since I opened my eyes.
 Looking towards the waterfall, I found a shimmering ribbon of light working its way down the rock face.
 The sight was so incredibly beautiful it took me several moments to realize the tendril was the waterfall I'd been looking for.
 I reached into the dancing pool of light at my feet and smiled as my cupped hands came away filled with water that lit up my palms.

For months I lived in abject fear.
 Of losing my mind.
 Of my heart giving out.
 I remembered the faces my dad used to make as he fumbled in his pocket for his stash of nitroglycerin, with every muscle straining at once as if the strain was all that held him together.
 Panic attacks work like this: adrenalin kicks in when it has no business doing so.
 Because it’s so unwarranted, the fight or flight response it unleashes causes a paralyzing sort of fear, which spirals upward into what feels like the beginning of eternal torment.
 While under the spell of that malady, I came upon 1 John 4:18 in the King James version: “There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment.
 He that feareth is not made perfect in love.” I can testify that fear has torment, even that fear is torment.
 And since I suffered and recovered from panic attacks, I feel qualified to offer a remedy.
 Back then, I often read The Daily Word, which frequently repeated the message, “Let go and let God.” What we churchgoing folk might call surrender.

The real constraint on job creation in the industrial nations is not the price of labour, but the need for increased capital investment, partly to counter the effects of reduced military spending and the drastic fall in output and demand in Eastern Europe.
 Increasing public investment to stimulate employment is constrained by widespread concern about rising levels of public debt.
 Recent reports state that the gross debt of OECD countries has risen from 35 per cent of GDP in 1970 to 70 per cent in 1993.
 But this figure is of questionable significance.
 The gross debt includes the debt held by government departments and public agencies as well as by private institutions and individuals.
 When the government-held portion is deducted, the actual net debt of these countries is approximately half the gross debt, which means the net interest burden for servicing the debt is also only half.
 Furthermore, it is not clear that a comparison of debt to GDP is a very meaningful index.
 Debt is a cumulative measure of stock, while GDP is an annual measure of flow.
 When the total debt of OECD countries is compared to the total capital stock of these countries, the debt is equal to a relatively modest 15 per cent of the current capital stock of these nations.
 In contrast to the recommendations made by the OECD, the Delors Plan for stimulating employment in Western Europe, which was recently rejected by member countries of the European Community, called for a large increase in public investment in expensive communication and transportation infra structure projects as a means of creating more jobs in the near term and increasing the competitive ness of European economies by improving their infra structure.

Much as she tried not to, Aurelia burst into laughter.
 “Get over here,” she said.
 A small silver dagger appeared in her hands.
 Harruq eyed it warily.
 “What’s that for?” he asked.
 “When was the last time you cut your hair?” Aurelia asked.
 The half-orc shrugged, for some reason embarrassed.
 “I don’t know.

Seth walked out from behind a tree.
 But he was normal Seth.
 He had his dirty blonde hair back and was wearing his dirty jeans and shirt from school.
 No dark red hair, no glimmering sword, no bleeding wound.
 His warrior self was nowhere to be seen.
 “Seth how’d you do that?” I asked.
 He whirled around.
 “Who’s there?” “Me, you idiot!” I snorted.

If it was, Dominic's fluid, expressive face pulled it off.
 "Nonsense.
 Once we undo all of the damage from her teaching you, you'll do so well even she won't flunk you."
 It went against everything past experience with Mrs. Tiggs had taught me, but I almost believed her.
 Chapter 26 It was amazing how quickly my classes flew by when I had a friend, or at least a protector, with me at all times.
 Then again all of Monday had flown by, not just the school portion of the day, so it really shouldn't have been a surprise today was doing likewise.
 After Spanish, Jasmin had escorted me to Mrs. Campbell's class.
 Telling her I wasn't going to be able to help out at the lab anymore had been one of the harder things I'd ever done, but she'd been surprisingly understanding.
 We'd scheduled my makeup test for the next day and I'd left with the sneaking suspicion she'd guessed more about what was really going on in Sanctuary than either pack would've liked.
 I'd been busy contemplating what Mrs. Campbell might have really figured out as we left the building, only to have Jasmin interrupt my musings with an apology of all things.

Shortly before Easter, my Aunt Woody invited my mom for a Las Vegas weekend.
 Eric and I decided to join them.
 All night we sped across the desert.
 My mom and aunt were dressed for breakfast by the time we arrived, to their surprise and dismay.
 They loaned us their room until evening.
 Room service delivered bourbon and ginger ale.
 Around noon, we adjourned to the pool, on the lookout for showgirls.
 At least that was my motive.
 The pool featured a high dive like the one at Carmen Ranch Club where Eric worked part-time as an apprentice lifeguard and trampoline instructor.
 He climbed, sprang, jackknifed and got a few cheers from spectators, including several showgirls.

And I was tied to a wall.
 Why hadn’t they killed me already?
 I waited for the flames.
 What came instead was far more excruciating.
 I expected to collapse as my body disconnected from my mind, but the vines held me in place.
 I saw a few final flickers of the battle before my eyes looked toward the sky, rolling back into my head.
 I had no way of forming a coherent thought or I might have been afraid.
 Chapter Seventeen A Fitting End
 I was surprised, in my dreams, that I wasn’t already dead.

 My head cleared, but Chevelle still held me around the arms.
 My neck flushed, my eyes shooting to my lap.
 I couldn’t look at him.
 What am I doing?
 The door opened and Chevelle’s hands dropped as he stood to face the newcomer.
 “They are here.” It was Steed’s voice, but I didn’t raise my head, the blood still hot in my cheeks.
 “Take her to the ridge, I will meet you after…” Chevelle stopped midsentence.

"Her notes say you're all supposed to be able to work on some kind of group project.
 Just keep it to a dull roar."
 It was like releasing a bunch of kids in a candy store and telling them to sample whatever they wanted.
 Every single girl in the classroom but me made an instant beeline towards Alec's desk.
 The guys were a little slower, but not by much.
 For a while I tried to ignore all of the poorly disguised gushing about how brave Alec was, or attempts by the guys to recreate exactly what Alec would've done if Vincent had gone ahead and thrown a punch.
 After fifteen minutes I finally gave up, closed my book and flipped open my notebook.
 Our physics class was about the most sedate, nerdy group of people I'd yet met.
 If they were this worked up about the fight, it was a good thing I didn't share any other classes with Alec.

 Even I could tell that I wasn't doing a very good job pretending I believed him.
 Alec recaptured one of my hands in his, and then leaned back, lazily exuding confidence.
 "It's okay that you don't believe me yet, I'm equal to the challenge of convincing you."
 He smiled at my shrug, but now that we weren't arguing about the inevitable fact he was eventually going to leave me, my mind was free to start working again.
 "Don't do what?"
 For the first time ever, I'd managed to catch him by surprise.
 It took him several seconds to figure out what I was talking about.

 “Wake up, Qurrah.”
 The half-orc lifted his eyelids to see the thoroughly unwelcoming sight of Velixar frowning down at him.
 “Yes, master?” he asked, puzzled, for it was still before dawn.
 He had slept no more than a few hours, he figured.
 “Who is it your brother travels with now?” Velixar asked.
 “You say he has abandoned you, but to whom?”
 “An elf named Aurelia,” Qurrah said as he sat up.
 He rubbed his eyes, still feeling groggy.
 “Why do you ask?”

They'd nearly triggered a full-scale blowup.
 Mom thought I just wanted new clothes.
 I knew we couldn't afford a new wardrobe just because I was temporarily skinny.
 I didn't mind wearing my old stuff, I just didn't want to wear Cin...wear her clothes.
 My near attack ended the conversation, albeit with my old clothes still packed away in some anonymous box.
 Mom's enthusiasm couldn't be damped for long though.
 It had fully returned by the time she turned my light off.
 "Have a good night, Adri...ana.
 You'll see, tomorrow will be like the start of a whole new life."
 I kept the tears back until the door was shut, and then they came in a hot rush that left me depleted and sore.

 Johnny – What does that have to do with anything?

 They would treat him like he was special and give him more lee-way.
 Johnny – So, where’s the downside to that?

“Rise.
 Let us begin.”
 Velixar taught until the stars retreated from the obnoxious sun.
 Qurrah returned home, his eyes sagging and his mind exhausted.
 When he climbed into bed, he fell asleep instantly.
 Not long after, Harruq rose, took his swords, and left for his own meeting.

 Harruq shrugged and held out two branches he had whittled into crude imitations of swords.

 “Never say his name unless you’re sure he’s not around.

 “I don’t have to be told a million times.

 He stared at me happily.
 “Oh you have to come to Igneeria, miss.” “Wow wait, hold it!” I held my hands out.
 “Buddy, you just show up talking about some destiny that we don’t know about and then you say that we have to come to some place that’s not here, and you expect us to go?

I tried on a variety of jeans, blouses, shirts, skirts, dresses, and just about every other article of clothing imaginable.
 I drew the line at a swimsuit, since there was no way on earth I'd ever wear one, and then felt so bad at how crushed Rachel was that I let her drag me into a store full of formals.
 It was a mistake because I soon found myself being zipped into a delicate, green dress that I was absolutely positive wasn't going to survive the experience of trying to wrap itself around me.
 "Oh, it's perfect, Adri.
 We have to get it."
 I avoided looking at the mirror.
 It seemed like a crime to defile such a pretty dress, and I wanted to remember it like it had looked on the hanger, all shimmery and wispy.
 I did risk a look down at the price tag.
 My heart actually skipped a beat.
 That was more than some people spent on their first car.

How could she have become so much a part of him in only five weeks?
 He'd been engaged to a woman who hadn't been as deeply imbedded in his heart and soul as Marie.
 How could his life ever be complete again without her?
 He wondered if she was feeling the same way.
 Was she finding that home wasn't the same as it had been before she'd fallen in love with him?
 Did she wonder how she could ever feel complete again?
 But no--she was dead!
 The agony of that realization pierced his numbed heart.
 This was 2011; she'd gone back to 1927, been reunited with her family, probably gotten married and had children.
 Now she was dead.

The attack was still trying to overwhelm me, but Brandon not knowing the full extent of my weakness robbed it of some of the momentum necessary to roll me all the way under.
 I managed some kind of reply, one that might've even been witty, but which apparently didn't manage to cover up the fact I wasn't really okay.
 We drove in silence the rest of the way into town, and by the time we turned into the school parking lot I'd come back to myself enough to be desperately looking for something else to say.
 I needed something cool enough Brandon wouldn't write me off as a lost cause.
 Wish-granting fairies somewhere were working overtime, because as Brandon turned off the engine, I saw a mob of people over by one of the smaller entrances to the school.
 "Wow, I wonder what's going on over there."
 We were both out of the car now, and it seemed the most natural thing in the world to grab Brandon's arm and tug him over to the crowd.
 It wasn't until I felt the iron-hard muscles under my now-tingling hand that I realized what I'd done.
 I felt a surge of heat wash over my face and neck.
 Brandon for once didn't have an easy comeback to defuse the awkwardness.

“You are so beautiful, your skin so soft,” Rodregas said.
 “You are the complete woman; beautiful, intelligent, brave.” He reached down and placed his finger below her chin and raised it up to be equal in height to his.
 “I have wanted you since I first saw you,” and with that straight forward statement, he reached down, and holding her face steady with his single finger, he slowly, softly kissed her.
 For a moment she tried to pull away, but he kept the pressure of his finger steady and firm so she could feel his desire.
 He made his lips eager but light, not too forceful.
 He was strong and he let her feel his strength, but he also gave her plenty of leverage so that if she truly wanted to pull away she could.
 He was making his desire clear, but the decision was hers.
 He cared for her too much, and was so determined to walk the path of righteousness and he was determined to be very careful.
 A younger man would have been in a hurry.
 But Rodregas was lost in the softness of her lips, the look of her eyes, and the beauty of her spirit.

 Britney nodded emphatically.

 You and I will destroy this world side by side.
 We will lay waste to all life and put absolute order upon every last soul.”

 "It's so beautiful.
 I don't know what to say.
 Are you sure you want to give it up?"
 Alec looked back up at me, and his eyes were filled with incredible need.
 I was suddenly struck by the similarities to the me he'd painted, and what I saw written on his face.
 It seemed impossible he would be unsure, that a glorious being like him could ever need anything I could provide, but I couldn't deny it was there.
 There was no way of knowing what it was, but I didn't care.
 Whatever it was he needed I wanted to give him.
 I opened my mouth to say as much, but my vocal chords wouldn't cooperate.

“You’ll need to learn protection spells.” “I… I can’t…” “We won’t tell Francine or the Council,” he promised, and I didn’t miss that he’d used Fannie’s real name.

 When we’d distanced ourselves from the tree line, he stopped and turned back to me, still holding my right hand.
 My eyes followed his as he looked down at our clasped hands and a cool blue flame lit on my right sleeve.
 Immediately, my free hand jerked up to extinguish it.
 Chevelle took it to keep me from smacking at the flame, which had already disappeared.
 “No,” he said, “use the magic.

Political states may still be able to survive wars, but developmental achievements can not.
 So long as the benefits of development are confined to one or a few sections of society, the costs of militarization and war may not prevent economic and social progress.
 But when the need is to fulfil the rising expectations of the masses by extending the benefits of development to the entire society – thus enabling the society as a whole to move to the next higher level of collective affluence and fulfilment – every social resource must be garnered and harnessed for this purpose.
 The colossal cost of armaments and the catastrophic destruction of war are incompatible with the achievement of prosperity for all.
 Peace has become the fundamental imperative for development.
 War as an Instrument of Policy
 Humanity has lived with war for so many millennia that it is difficult to imagine a world without it.
 Even in the four decades of ‘peace’ following the Second World War, approximately 160 inter-state and intra-state wars, including 100 major conflicts, have been fought in developing countries, leading directly to 20 million deaths – half of them caused by the armed forces of developed countries in Korea, Indochina, Algeria and other anti-colonial wars – and to another 20 million war-related casualties.
 These massive casualties during a time of ‘peace’ are roughly equal to the total casualties incurred by all the countries of the world during the last world war.
 An equally disturbing phenomenon has been the expansion of violence within society for political purposes.

She jabbed her staff upward, pushing the two attacks high and giving her room underneath.
 Ducking forward, she tried to strike the half-orc’s leg.
 She badly underestimated Harruq’s new speed though, and one blade looped around to block the attack.
 The other went straight down, the edge smashing hard against the top of Aurelia’s skull.
 While it did not draw blood, the jolt of it knocked the elf to one knee and gave her a dull ache in her head.
 “Have you lost your mind?” Aurelia asked as she rolled away.
 Harruq’s mad charge was her answer, and it sparked fear in her heart.
 Sword strikes assailed her impossibly fast.
 Any thought of the fight being practice left Aurelia’s mind.
 It felt too real.

The horrifying thought gripped his mind.
 "If we'd made love, you might have gotten pregnant and then gone back to 1927, and I would never have known that I had a child."
 That thought cooled his desire faster than anything else could have.
 He thought she might have changed her mind about staying if they'd made love—but what if they'd made love and she hadn't?
 Marie began sobbing.
 "I'd love to have your baby."
 "I couldn't bear wondering.
 And you'd be shamed.
 In 1927 you'd-you'd have a hard time finding a man to marry you and raise the baby as his."
 He squeezed his eyes shut but was unable to keep tears from seeping out at the thought of Marie married to someone else.

Development is widely regarded as the cause of moral decline and increasing corruption, crime and violence.
 These negative consequences are primarily due to the fact that freedom has been extended to vast sections of the population which were confined in the past by rigid social barriers and minimum expectations, so they never had need or occasion to embrace the values they now eschew.
 The earlier self-restraint has been replaced by a self-assertion that has not yet acquired the productive values needed for achievement.
 Rising expectations enhance this tendency.
 While it is true that corruption is more prevalent today than ever before, it is also true that the entire global economy functions on the basis of a faith, honesty, openness and tolerance that would have been inconceivable in the past.
 We mourn the loss of cloistered values, which were very often accompanied by narrow rigidity and provincialism, while failing to recognize the enormous growth in positive human values that has made possible the incredible progress of the past few decades.
 In past centuries cultural values were handed down to future generations through the family.
 Education, which now focuses on the transfer of information, ideas and mental skills, can also impart development-oriented values such as open-mindedness, initiative and innovation.
 Integration and tolerance of diversity are crucial values for the further development of the human community.
 Yet the increasing speed of globalization has accentuated a contrary tendency toward increasing fragmentation.

They're all monsters, but you aren't."
 Alec finally let his eyes fully meet mine.
 "How can you know that when sometimes I'm not sure myself?"
 Almost without realizing it, I moved my hand from his arm to his stomach, and then wrapped both arms around him and pressed my face into his rock-hard chest.
 "Thank you for saving my life.
 Were those wolves some of Brandon's friends?"
 I felt him nod.
 "Simon and Nathanial."
 "I didn't know them that well, they mostly ignored me, but I didn't think they'd kill me."
 Alec finally put his arms around me.

“Good morning!” she said and twirled around.
 “Hello bare ground that has no forest!” “You seem to be in a good mood today,” I mused and watched her twirl.
 She stopped and her face crinkled up in thought.
 “I think it's because I didn't wake up to be in a never-ending forest.
 Plus, last night Jason got so sick of arguing with me he just gave up.

 “That's only because I was too tired to keep arguing with you,” Jason said and he sat down next to Seth.
 “If it was morning, it would have been different.” Emily sighed and shook her finger.
 “Excuses.” “Listen guys,” Seth said, “I have something to tell you.” He looked at me and I nodded.
 Emily twirled her hair.

 On his way back home, the threepence jingling in his hand, Harruq spotted a patrol of guards approaching.
 He glanced to the right, where the small alley led back to their shed.
 If he hurried, he might be able to make it before they noticed…
 He was halfway down the alley when he heard a voice call out.
 “Hey!”
 Harruq kept going.
 He was used to harassment and verbal abuse from the guards.
 Once out of sight, though, he was usually out of mind.
 He relied on that as he turned a corner into the small space around their shed.

I knew I wouldn't find any kind of refuge there.
 Instead, I pulled out a pencil and a sheet of paper from my notebook, and started sketching.
 The process slowly started pulling me back out of the numbness.
 I wasn't actually any good as an artist.
 Mom had exposed me to enough art for me to realize that early on.
 I lacked some kind of creative spark necessary to achieve any kind of real beauty.
 Still, I occasionally enjoyed trying to recreate something I'd seen.
 This time I didn't try to guide my hand, I just let it create lines and curves at random, until something tugged at my subconscious, and a half-formed memory began to materialize on the page before me.
 I knew that the wavy vertical line off the side was destined to become a waterfall.
 The scene was starting to take shape, but for the first time in ages I still couldn't place it.

Leaving would have sufficed, but it felt like running, felt like escape.
 And I knew I was trapped.
 Someone would stop me.
 Yes, I was running.
 My head swung to locate a noise at the edge of the clearing behind me.
 Long robes… two council members.
 My throat went dry and Chevelle grabbed my shoulders as he spoke in a low voice.
 “Home, Freya.
 Run.” I didn’t hesitate, I sprinted straight home without looking back.
 The house seemed empty but I didn’t check.

And in that condition, the world transforms before our eyes.
 For passing out food, clothing or loving concern we always get blessed, and while we live with a blessed attitude, the most bedraggled people may appear possessed of astonishing beauty, as God must see them.
 When we follow the example of Jesus, through his blessing we begin to perceive the glorious reality of all creation.
 In other words, we enter heaven in all its beauty.

 James 4: 17 in the King James declares, “Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.” The New International Version reads “Anyone, then, who knows the good he ought to do and doesn’t do it, sins."
 The New American Standard’s version is, “Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin.” Put these translations together, they insist that to do good is the right thing and what we ought to do.
 But even in consort, they don’t explain why we ought to do good or why we should avoid sin.
 We could infer we should do it because God said so, but to some of us, that answer feels unworthy.
 Pastor Ed Noble suggested an answer that rings more complete.

Not wanting to out-and-out lie, I ducked into the nearest restroom.
 It was empty except for a mousy brunette I'd only seen a couple of times before.
 I smiled and started to open my mouth to say hi, but thought better of it.
 This was Sanctuary.
 She wasn't going to acknowledge the new girl was even breathing, let alone sentient.
 It should have bothered me, but I just shrugged it off and went to the far stall.
 A split second after I'd closed the door I heard the heavy wooden outer door open.
 Normally that wouldn't have caused me to even pause in my normal routine, but it suddenly felt as if the stall was too small.
 "I told you to stay away from him, you stupid whore."
 I didn't recognize the voice for all that I felt like I should.

Only handfuls live within these walls, and they are just diplomats and messengers.
 Our king is a spiteful, paranoid one.”
 “Not my king,” Harruq muttered loud as he dared.
 He meant to say more but stopped as another man neared the fountain.
 He was large, well-muscled, and scratching at a long beard that stretched down to his belt.
 In a massive voice, he shouted to the mulling throngs.
 “The royal guard is in need of able-bodied men to help rebuild the walls of the city,” he shouted.
 “The work will be hard, but we offer a threepence of copper a day.
 Come to the castle and ask for Alvrik.”
 He repeated the message three more times and then wandered back north.

The doors were large enough that the three of them could have entered abreast through the threshold and the doors were solid enough, looking as if they were made out of whole trees.
 Bound in iron, they looked like they could handle a battering ram better than even the front gates.
 A group of knights stood tall next to the doors, but their heads tracked the presence of Rodregas and his two companions.
 Rodregas vaguely remembered one as Gorin, an older man who under more prosperous times for the knighthood would now be enjoying his retirement.
 “Gorin!” Rodregas yelled boastfully, “Open the doors, the Grand Marshal says that I may review the choice I must make.” Rodregas walked over and slapped the knight in the arm, laying it on heavy.
 Luckily, his success on the field had him in a good mood.
 Rodregas waved at the heavy doors as if wiggling his fingers could open them.
 “Sir Rodregas, you look good for having just completed the tournament this day,” said Gorin.
 “I would not expect you to be moving around much yet.” Rodregas nodded.
 He could not explain that he already had a minor sigil of healing.

While he had seen the two interact for some years, he really did not know what was appropriate for him to say in such a circumstance.
 Rodregas knew that he did not have the skills for pretending he was a powerful Immortalist sorcerer, so he said, “How many people have you killed during the past year Korin?
 And how many others have you raped or tortured?” he asked, trying to keep a calm voice.
 Now Korin looked very surprised and he started looking around.
 Rodregas saw that Korin noticed the study door, though he was working hard to not show it.
 “How many?” Rodregas repeated his question.
 “I am not sure,” Korin said.
 “For us to truly become divine we must of course develop our skills.” As Korin answered the question he took a step back.
 Rodregas quickly stepped forward and pushed him hard against the wall.
 Korin hit with a hard smack and slid to the ground, hurt, but not badly.

And she was conniving.
 When I’d first come to live with her she had sent me to Council repeatedly, complaining of my behavior.
 I had undergone hours of “evaluations” under the scrutiny of Council members.
 Exams and trials and endless questions.
 Black blots on parchment that made abstract shapes.
 “What do you see, Elfreda?” I knew what they wanted to hear—butterfly and flower species.
 But I was so resentful toward Fannie for putting me there, I usually saw a black blob of death consuming her.
 “A Monarch,” I’d say.
 She looked beyond me at the few inches of open floor, and I took the opportunity to bolt past her down the hall, straight out the door at full speed.
 I ran from the house, ignoring the paths; other elves would be no help to me.

I was instructed to get as much incriminating conversation as I could, including the price, quantity and name of the drug; anything beyond that would be helpful but gravy.
 The main thing was to get the money for the drugs.
 Then I was shown the contents of a small white plastic bottle: One hundred Oxys poured into the officer’s hand.
 They were smaller than I thought they would be and an odd green color.
 He gathered the pills back into the bottle and handed them to me, telling me to put them in an easily accessible jacket pocket.
 The officers were all gathered around, but my focus was now entirely on the lead man, Officer White, the same undercover officer who had busted my son, had screwed up by giving Brandon the wrong phone number and with whom I had negotiated this deal.
 He was cocky and his ego always front and center, but I completely understood this demeanor.
 A person who does this for a living should have a high level of confidence, and that translates into what one might call “a strong personality.” I was listening as if my life depended on these men.
 It did.
 I was told that I would also be arrested in a mock arrest so that the dealers would think we were all busted.

I closed my eyes as a wave of heat started at my collarbones and rushed up to the tips of my ears.
 I wanted to throw up, except that would be even more embarrassing than being carried out of class by the most popular boy in school.
 I opened my eyes and found we were already out in the hall.
 Alec's stride was so smooth it was hard to believe we weren't still back in the classroom.
 "Put me down, I mean please put me down."
 Those clear, deep eyes met mine for a second, seeming to look past the surface and all the way down to the bleeding mental gash that'd just triggered my most recent collapse.
 I was trying to marshal my arguments, but his eyes wiped my mind clean.
 I couldn't form another coherent thought until he shook his head and looked away.
 "You need to see the nurse."
 My mind hiccupped for a second.

I was so busy worrying how I'd deal with Cassie when I saw her that it took me a minute to realize the car had slowed as it approached.
 "Wow, I drive all this way, and then you deprive me of the pleasure of the last hundred feet."
 The deep, smooth voice was unmistakable even if the light was still too poor to make out anything else.
 I slipped inside the Mustang with a grin playing at the edge of my lips despite my best efforts to remain cool and collected.
 "Well, I didn't want to start your day off too well, or everything else would be anticlimactic."
 "Really?
 You weren't just worried I wasn't going to show up?
 Because you understand how someone could've been thinking you'd walked down your lane so you could catch the bus if I'd forgotten about you?"
 I'd been giving Brandon my crinkled-nose glare for a solid three seconds before his easy laugh made me realize what I was doing.
 I hadn't done that to anyone in months, it'd been my trademark expression for when a family member had made me mad.

Well, it was like the music held me there—she could have been gone for hours.
 I was riveted.
 And there was my dad, looking cool, and blowing beautiful, liquid melodies out of that licorice stick.
 Sweet stuff.
 “Canadian Sunset,” “Old Brown Jug,” “St.
 Louis Blues,” “Blues for Allen Felix.”  It was a revelation.
 But, never to be repeated.
 I think I was about 6 at the time, but that hour in front of Dick Delisi and the Syncopators is as fresh in my mind as if it happened yesterday.
 Man, my dad.
 What could he have been?

 "Does it fit?

“Did his tongue die with him?” Harruq asked.
 “I haven’t told him he can speak yet,” Qurrah responded.
 His eyes flicked back from Harruq to the spirit.
 “You may talk, spirit, but keep it quiet.”
 “You take my life, and now you dare keep me from eternity?” the spirit moaned.
 “For what reason do you torment me?
 I have never harmed you, never said a cursing word, but now this?”
 “Just a few questions and you may return to your slumber.”
 Qurrah paused, a smile growing across his lips.
 “Tell me, did you ever sleep with an orcish woman?”

Jasmin just looked like she'd rather be anywhere than on babysitting duty.
 Rachel had explained that Alec didn't want us delicate, fragile girls traveling alone, so he'd assigned us bodyguards, who happened to also be female and delicate-looking, but who weren't nearly as fragile.
 Also, it turned out we weren't going to Sanctuary, or St. George, or even anywhere in Utah, a fact I didn't realize until we'd been on the road for twenty minutes.
 "Oh, Adri, don't be silly.
 You can't do real shopping in Sanctuary.
 Besides, Alec wouldn't have let the four of us go alone if we'd been planning on staying so close to Brandon's territory.
 Vegas was definitely the best option given the time restrictions we're under."
 I'd settled in for a long trip, only to realize as we crossed the state line that Jasmin was positively shattering the speed limit.
 I managed to limit myself to a single gulp, when I saw just how fast she was going, but everyone else was so relaxed that I finally managed to unclench my fists and join back in the conversation.
 It helped that the Mercedes was so smooth, and that I knew Jasmin had reflexes and reaction time that would've made any Indy racer insanely jealous.

He tore his gaze back to the fight.
 More orcs had pushed inward, leaving them bunched in a wide circle.
 They flung themselves against the surrounding guards.
 Again he felt a cold chill, this time creeping across his arms like frost spiders.
 The sensation of being watched was unbearable.
 “We need to move,” he said.
 “If the guards falter we might suffer.”
 “We’re already high up,” Harruq said.
 “We’re perfectly safe…”
 “I said now!” Qurrah shouted.

Liberal democracy and economic opportunity for all are essential ingredients for winning the war against terrorism.
 Accepting the spiritual principle which tells us that there is an element of truth even in the most outrageous or misinformed viewpoint, we must not only vehemently condemn but also sincerely recognize the unaddressed issues that underpin the urge for violence.
 In this sense, terrorists crudely expose the mental insincerity prevalent in international politics.
 Those who wield national power must come to realize that force of compulsion will not bring about a permanent reconciliation and amelioration of relationships in human affairs.
 Superior power must bring with it a superior sense of fairness and a commitment to constructive dialogue and action to attack the root causes of terrorism.
 It must shed its own accretion of mental insincerity cloaked as diplomacy.
 Then and then only these movements of violence will shrink and finally disappear.
 The period following September 11th, as US National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice put it, is one “not just of grave danger, but of enormous opportunity.”
 Resolving Local Conflicts: The Commission concluded that the end of the Cold War made it possible to successfully resolve problems that had resisted solution for decades, such as the many violent communal and ethnic conflicts occurring in the world.
 The near total cessation of violence in North Ireland during the past 10 years is proof that rapid progress can be made on issues involving apparently intractable communal sentiments.

Chevelle answered slowly, “There has to be a way.
 You broke them before.” I tried to remember how.
 The first magic I could recall was the thistle in the back room at Junnie’s.
 It seemed so far away now.
 Ruby was speaking to him.
 “Maybe it was just the length of time…” What did she know about how long I was bound?
 “If we can find a way to test without endangering—” He stopped.
 “Don’t worry about it, Frey.” I wondered if I’d looked frightened.
 “We will figure it out.” How reassuring.
 I meant to smile at him, but only succeeded in pressing my lips into a flat line.

She put her shoulders back, which caused her firm, rounded breast’s to thrust out.
 Rodregas didn’t think she meant the gesture to be sexual, but he hesitated at the sight of her superbly shaped body.
 Rodregas ignored his own rush of hormones and pushed her high on the shoulder and she stumbled back.
 “Now,” he said, “lower your center of gravity.
 Bend your legs, but keep them loose.” She followed his instructions, and he thought this would make her look less striking, but she went from a statuesque dancer to a crouching feline.
 He breathed in through his nose and tried to ignore his newly youthful hormones.
 This time when he pushed her shoulder she went back but did not stumble.
 “See, you stayed in control.
 You stumble in a fight and you are dead.
 With your center low you have control.

The young man started to split in two.
 The physical man stood there, but as he watched, another ethereal version, the man’s spirit, his very non-corporal essence, was suddenly pulled from his body, and then whipped around and out of the burning circle.
 Rodregas was not sure, but as this ethereal version of the man was pulled apart, Rodregas thought he could see him screaming.
 Rodregas pulled his eyes away from the horrifying vision as the corporal man went from looking confused and unsure to having no expression at all, like an empty piece of meat.
 Rodregas’s eyes flinched away from the terrible sight as he felt he might scream in horror and fury at what was happening.
 Then Ravenhurr yelled out, “Spirea faira podia turiana,” and the circle holding the Celestial Lion started to burn in the same blue flames, the blue flames that make up the creation forces of life that can only be called up when the Celestial Realm was close.
 Suddenly the sleeping lion looked up in surprise and started to growl and then he started to burn.
 Rodregas had seen enough of lesser versions of the ritual to expect it, but to watch it was amazing.
 The circle blazed with an intense heat that blasted his face and the magnificent creature inside blazed with blue creation fire.
 It was a sudden and violent and primal process.

The guard saw Rodregas’ braided leather armor and steel sword and thrust with the point.
 The lunge was perfect, the guard went for dead center, and even though Rodregas had been waiting for a similar move, the thrust almost caught him off guard.
 The guard had only one problem, one that he could not have anticipated.
 Rodregas had been taking easy swings, not revealing his true speed.
 Once the guard committed, Rodregas brought both of his swords down and met the lunging blade.
 Rodregas could not meet his sword edge to edge, but it was thrusting out and he caught it and pushed it down and to the left.
 At the same time he moved his body to the side and in close.
 Rodregas then dropped his right sword as he kept his left engaged, pushing the blue steel sword away.
 Rodregas moved in and thrust out with his open hand with a speed the guard simply could not match nor have expected.
 Rodregas had the guard’s throat in his grasp before his opponent knew what was happening.

 “Forgive me, master,” Qurrah said, bowing.
 His teeth chattered in the cold.
 Velixar waved a hand.
 The dwindling fire between them swelled to a healthy blaze.
 “The two brothers were arrogant to think they could create a paradise with a creature so full of faults as man,” Velixar continued.
 “I saw the battle waged in the small town of Haven, there in the center of the delta.
 It is an awesome thing to watch gods duel.
 Ashhur fled before either could strike a killing blow.

For the developing countries as a whole, the most critical question is how to create quickly hundreds of millions of jobs for the poor with limited purchasing power and limited capital for investment.
 The idea that most of these jobs could be created in the corporate sector or by government-sponsored activities has been put to rest.
 Currently, there are nearly one billion self-employed and unpaid family workers in the world, most of them self-employed farmers in developing countries.
 The self-employed represent 48 per cent of the workforce in low-income economies (less than $500 per capita GDP).
 For any strategy to be successful, it must give central importance to self-employment and entrepreneurship, with emphasis on agriculture, agro-industry and small firms in the informal sector.
 While a single approach will not be applicable to countries and regions of the world in different stages of development, a number of common principles and strategies are widely applicable.
 Agriculture as an engine
 Slightly more than half the world’s workforce, of whom 30 per cent are women, are still engaged in agriculture.
 Agriculture will remain the largest single occupation for the foreseeable future.
 For too long this sector has been regarded by planners primarily as the source of essential food production.

“So, let, me, fix, that, for, you!”
 She stopped when he passed out from the pain.
 She turned his head to the side so he wouldn’t choke on his own blood, a strange gesture of kindness considering what was left of his manhood.
 “Glad to give you something to remember the town by,” she said.
 After a flirtatious flip of her hair, she started down the street.
 Aurelia froze, her blood as cold as when she had sensed the man in black.
 This time no magic could be blamed, and no sense of death.
 No, it was just the sight of Harruq, dressed in black armor and wielding ancient blades dripping with blood.
 Just the sight of him massacring an elven warrior.
 “Oh, Harruq,” she whispered.

 If she'd met him in 1927, she'd probably have felt every bit as much confusion as she was feeling now.
 He took her hand, pressing his lips into her palm.
 "If you belonged in 2011, things would be different."
 He stroked her fingers thoughtfully.
 If she belonged here, he would be pursuing her relentlessly.

 I tried to smile, but I found it more than a little unnerving.
 Big city life hadn't been so intrusive.
 I hadn't even known my neighbors growing up.
 In Minneapolis the people you lived next to and the people you associated with were always kept properly segregated.
 I tuned back into what Britney was saying just in time to answer a question with something safely non-committal.
 She didn't seem to need much in the way of responses to keep her talking.
 Probably for hours if she could get away with it.
 "I'm glad you feel the same.

“For ages, I will make you suffer.”
 “Try it,” said Dieredon.
 Two more arrows flew, but they halted in mid-air.
 Velixar stood, his hand outstretched, gripping the projectiles with his mind.
 The elf fired two more volleys but all the arrows froze beside the others.
 “Fool,” Velixar hissed.
 At once, the arrows turned and resumed their flight, straight at Dieredon.
 The elf dove, rolling underneath the barrage.
 Not an arrow had hit earth before the elf tucked his feet and kicked.
 The blades sprang from his bow.

 "So this isn't normal?"
 Dom shook her head again.
 "No, in most packs, any confrontation ends in violence.
 Generally there are a whole host of dominants who want to become the alpha.
 This would usually turn into a real dominance fight, with the other two doing their very best to kill him before turning on each other to fight over the spoils."

Britney looked like she was having a hard time getting enough air.
 She gasped a couple more times, and then managed to get some words out.
 "I'm so sorry.
 I didn't realize you'd care.
 I thought it would be okay."
 I pinned her in place with my eyes for several seconds to prove I didn't believe her, and then shrugged.
 "I don't suppose it matters all that much.
 I just know now that I can't trust you with those kinds of things."
 Mrs. Campbell's class served as another safe haven.
 There were still plenty of looks, but nobody dared gossip, and Britney was safely seated on the other side of the room.

I wish I could come right out and say it while you're awake.
 I don't want that life anymore.
 I don't really want any life that doesn't involve you."
 Part of me wanted to scream for joy, to jump up out of my bed and wrap myself around Alec as tightly as I could, but I was just too far gone.
 I half thought I was dreaming it all.
 As I finally let sleep pull me down into darkness, I almost thought I heard Alec say one last thing.
 The tone was so vulnerable and hesitant he almost sounded like another person.
 "The truth is, I've fallen well and truly in love with you."
 Chapter 23 Someone was calling my name, but I really didn't want to wake up.
 I was still so tired, and I'd had the most wonderful dreams.

Most women would never again speak to a man who had rejected her touch.
 But most women would have known exactly what they were doing.
 Marie had simply been yielding to the pleasure of his kisses and touches with no intention of giving up her virginity.
 He'd never known a woman so passionate.
 When they walked out into the garden, Marie headed for the fog without a backward glance.
 Rick grabbed her hand.
 "Marie, wait."
 He pulled her close, gazing down at her.

Three arrows pressed against the string of the bow, their tips dipped in holy water.
 His quiver, as was the quiver of every elf flying alongside him, contained water given to them by their clerics of Celestia.
 When their arrows bit into dead flesh, it would be like fire on a dry leaf.
 “Let no life lost this night be in vain!” Dieredon cried as they descended like a white river, raining arrows into the darkness.
 More than two hundred moving forms halted after that one pass, but a thousand more swayed in their sick, distracting dance.
 “One free pass,” Velixar said, observing the flight of elves as they swarmed overhead.
 They banked around, still in perfect formation, and then dove again.
 “Kill them now!” he ordered, his fingers crooking into strange shapes.
 “ _Hemorrhage!_ ” Qurrah hissed, pointing at the nearest horse.
 Blood ruptured from the beautiful creature’s neck.

If you haven't read Torn yet, please go check it out.
 When I set out to write Broken, I never expected that I was going to end up writing the same story from Alec's point of view, but I'm pleased with how both Broken and Torn have turned out, both individually and as a combined work.
 They are done in very different styles, but ultimately that was exactly what I was after.
 I think there is plenty of cross-over of guys reading paranormal romance, and girls picking up more action-packed stories.
 Ultimately I think most of us just want a compelling story, but sometimes the labels that get applied to books get in the way of us discovering them, rather than helping as they are meant to do.
 I think one of the things that made the Harry Potter books so successful was the fact that the whole family could share in the series.
 I remember as Twilight came out thinking that there were plenty of guys who would enjoy Twilight if they ever sat down and read it, but most of them wouldn't ever give it a try.
 My hope with Broken and Torn is that the two stories combine into something that both guys and girls can enjoy.
 The girls are likely to start out with Broken, while guys are likely to pick up Torn and enjoy the extra action there.
 Either way, my biggest hope would be that the guys can introduce their wives and girlfriends to Broken, and the girls can introduce their husbands and boyfriends to Torn.

He's the kindest, most thoughtful man I've ever known."
 "Is he the reason you ended your betrothal?"
 "In a way.
 I didn't have a chance to tell you about the last time I was with Davis.
 You and Father were out, and we came here to listen to the radio.
 He kissed me, which was wonderful at first.
 But then he started kissing me so hard that my teeth cut into my lips, and I tried to push him away, but he wouldn't stop.
 And he put his hand under my skirt to touch my leg.
 I was finally able to push him away, and all he said was to make sure that you told me what my duties would be once we were married."

He leaned closer.
 “You smell… like morning.” I bit my lip, heat rising up my neck, but he lingered, breathing in the scent.
 “Ruby,” I said.
 He looked confused.
 “Soap.” I had been reduced to one-word sentences.
 “Oh.” He nodded, leaning back.
 “She does have a way with potions and such.” “I enjoy the mixing,” Ruby said, startling me again as she entered the house.
 “But not to worry, I keep it contained to elements and minerals, no breeding.
 I leave that to Steed.” She laughed at her own words as she passed us on the way to her room.
 I found myself reevaluating her now that I knew she was Steed’s sister.

She wasn't properly his.
 There was no bond of Ja'tell, and consequently we have no obligation to return her to him."
 Jasmin opened her mouth to say something else, but a tiny brunette, probably Jessica, interrupted her.
 "Alec, we have to do this.
 None of us are stupid; we know what's going to happen.
 You killed two members of his pack."
 There was steel in Alec's voice that I'd never heard before.
 "Still unacceptable.
 You've all aired your opinions; you can retire to your beds now."
 James looked up from where he'd been slouching against the wall, and I suddenly realized that he wasn't shaking from cold.

She stood up and walked the couple of feet over to me and stopped.
 I pushed myself up and leaned against the tree.
 Emily gave me a light smile.
 “Good morning!” she said and twirled around.
 “Hello bare ground that has no forest!” “You seem to be in a good mood today,” I mused and watched her twirl.
 She stopped and her face crinkled up in thought.

The Polish fellow began goading me, first about my clothes, then about the beard I had grown, then about what losers were all us from California.
 I attempted patience, since I was their guest and because I remembered Tony’s stories that placed him in the low range of this crowd’s toughness.
 But at last I mouthed a comeback.
 The Polish fellow threw a punch that landed square on my jaw.
 I staggered.
 He tackled me.
 I fell and my head whacked the concrete floor.
 The next I knew, several guys were pounding various parts of me.
 I couldn’t seem to move from the waist up.
 Maybe one or more of them held me down.

As a soldier’s body collapsed at the end, the two stopped, and Harruq swore.
 “The orcs made it through,” he said, to which Qurrah nodded.
 “This could be bad.”
 An orc stepped into the alley, blood splashed across his gray skin.
 He held a sword in each hand, dripping gore coating both.
 Shouting something in a guttural language neither understood, the orc charged.
 “Get back,” Harruq ordered as he shoved Qurrah to one side.
 He slammed himself against a house, barely dodging a downward chop of the blades.
 The orc attacked again, all his strength behind the swing.
 Harruq ducked, narrowly avoiding decapitation.

I didn't like his tone, but he did have a right to be mad.
 Luckily, I was saved by Mrs. Alexander's appearance at the door, a dry-erase marker behind one ear, a pencil behind the other.
 The rest of the class period should have been enjoyable.
 My group had the right answer, which I'd come up with on my own, and we were now learning about leverage, mechanical advantage, and friction, all of which were actually pretty interesting.
 I studiously ignored Alec, even though I could all but feel him glaring at me the entire time.
 When the bell finally rang, Mrs. Alexander looked up from her white board with a startled expression.
 "I suppose that's it then.
 Don't forget to turn in your assignments on your way out."
 Anxious to make sure I got credit for all the work I'd done, I hurried up to the front of the class before Alec could get to his feet.

The way he talked was eerie and distressing, as if he meant to leave tomorrow and probably never come home.
 On his more effusive evenings, he might offer advice and wrest promises out of me.
 He asked for a promise that I would go straight to college, because a guy as smart as me simply ought to, and it would please my mom, who could use some cheering after her sorrows.
 He had witnessed how any talk of college made her glow.
 Besides, he didn’t want to see me get drafted.
 “You’d have a hell of a time in the service,” he said.
 “A teacher barks at you, it’s all you can do not to punch the guy.
 Think of what’d happen with a drill sergeant.
 You’d spend all your time locked up.” Twice he made me promise to watch over Billy, to be like a big brother, since Billy wouldn’t have him anymore.
 I said, “Why doesn’t he have you anymore?” “I mean after I’m gone.” “Well, you’re still here,” I said.

I tried to help her, and she gave me plenty in return, most of it dark, but nevertheless worth pondering.
 Each time we got together, we talked about books and ideas.
 Here is the conclusion of her favorite poem, "The Night They Burned Shanghai":
 Tonight Shanghai is burning, And we are dying too.
 What bomb more surely mortal Than death inside of you?
 For some men die by shrapnel, And some go down in flames, But most men perish inch by inch, In play at little games.
 Sylvia helped me remember to vow I wouldn’t go down that way.
 A while ago, a woman I enjoyed hanging out with accused me of being "serious."
 I don't think it was a compliment.
 I like to laugh, hear jokes and funny songs, whack golf balls back and forth across a fairway, cheer for teams and bring pleasant news wherever I can.

Too many rock lyricists—you can think of them as well as I can, say, that guy with Procol Harum, or that Emerson Lake and Palmer shit, or some of Jim’s stuff, which, to be honest, I can’t stomach, all that lizard king shit—they’re purposely making with the lit-rock attitude, you know?
 They want you to study their lyrics.
 I mean, “An idiot reigns in the ancient trees of the night,” or whatever the hell he says.
 Shit.
 What I’m saying, in a song like “Love for Lorelei” or “The Golden Apples of the Song”—new stuff, you haven’t heard it yet-- is that, here are my words, man, here’s my life in words.
 What I’m saying is what I mean.
 If I sing “I love you” over and over, that’s truth, man, that’s where I’m coming from, because I mean it, because I’m singing to Lor, and I love her, there’s no secret to it, there’s no murkiness, no florid touches, it’s just raw, like art should be, raw, simple, full of emotion.
 “I Want to Hold Your Ass While You Move”—I wrote that after a particularly beautiful night of lovemaking.
 I don’t care, you know.
 I don’t care if people think it’s too personal, too open, too—what?—minimal or plain and straightforward.

 "The reason I like dancing so much is that I like you to hold me."
 He smiled at the pretty rosiness in her cheeks.
 Taking her hand, he leaned close to whisper, "One day--one day soon--I plan to arrange things so that I can hold you all night long."
 Her blush deepened.

Economic policy recommendations failed adequately to anticipate either the impact of the programme on the people or their reaction to it.
 In the early stages of reform, the public exhibited an incredible degree of patience, tolerance and endurance under conditions of growing hardship.
 Gradually public resentment and personal suffering (especially for the aged, children and new entrants to the work force) became so severe in some countries that no government could have sustained the programme without facing political upheaval or violent revolution.
 There is some truth in the argument that ‘shock therapy’ did not fail in Russia and other countries, because it was never actually implemented.
 At each crucial juncture either the central bank or the government pulled back from enforcing the necessary fiscal discipline.
 But it is equally true that ‘shock therapy’ never could have been implemented by a democratic government, when it imposed such enormous hardship on the people and generated a polarization and fragmentation of political forces within the country.
 Where similar strategies have succeeded in other parts of the world, it has usually been under authoritarian governments, such as in Chile.
 Where force is not possible, the only viable alternative is to build social consensus in support of the reform strategy.
 Ultimately, the success of the reform measures will be determined by one factor – the extent to which the people understand, accept and are motivated to act under the new system.
 Before introducing any new measure, maximum effort should be made to communicate its purpose and nature to the people and win their understanding and approval.

It seemed more… formal.
 And there were many complaints about the additional workload, both with the castle duties—which were described in more detail—and her training.
 I couldn’t be sure how much time had passed without the entries being dated, but her mood had definitely shifted.
 Father has been merciless in my practice and testing with Rune.
 Unrelenting sessions are wearing on me.
 I can barely concentrate.
 I don’t have the energy for the simplest tasks, let alone the new and wild trials he’s created.
 He thinks he has to test every possible idea he has or else he won’t know what I might be capable of.
 He’s gone much more often lately, but Rune doesn’t let up in his absence.
 I wish there was a way to handle him, some way he’d give me a break when Father was away.

It is Ashley and she is trying to move me to a Starbucks that is on the other side of the same parking lot.
 I resist and ask her if that was her that stopped next to me in the red Dodge Charger.
 She says it was but she would rather meet at the Starbucks where there are some people around.
 I tell her to just come to my truck and let’s get this deal done.
 Ashley states she is suspicious that I won’t drive a hundred yards to meet her.
 I make a judgment call that I know will not make the undercover narcotics team happy but she is right, what is my great reason justifying not driving a short distance?
 I tell her I will drive right over and park by the Starbucks.
 I hang up with her and I state into my wire that we are moving to the Starbucks and to deal with it.
 My head set rings from my personal cell phone and the lead officer is a combination of irritated and understanding but he warns me to drive slowly and not to get too far in front of the van which will be coming in behind me.
 I am already backing up as he speaks to me.

“The bars had gaps between them.”
 Harruq gestured to the room.
 “Amazing no one ever robbed this guy before,” he said.
 Qurrah shot him a glance, his meaning clear.
 The half-orc shrugged, drew his swords, and began walking.
 A sleek staircase led to the upper floor, while through the hallway they could see a room with an iron stove and shelves for storing food.
 “Which way do we go?” Harruq asked.
 “Up,” Qurrah said.
 “And quiet, before you wake him.”
 “Too late,” said a voice from the stairs.

 I was empty man, as empty as a skull.
 And Lor brought me back.
 Love.
 That’s what saved me, moved me on down the road.
 That lost time in Arkansas, that was the crux, the fulcrum that my life turned on.
 That was the deciding time, the time I became something different.
 Something better.
 I believe that, dad, I was reborn in that cabin.
 I was reborn at my woman’s breast.

I gave Mom a wan smile, exactly the kind I used when I was really sick, and helped her finish packing.
 I wasn't sure whether I helped because I was feeling guilty, or because I was worried Brandon would show up before she'd left.
 Maybe I was just hoping to kill two birds with one stone.
 It wasn't until she was finally in the Jeep and backing down our lane that I finally stopped worrying that Brandon was going to pop around the corner.
 He'd been smugly confident he wouldn't show up before she was gone, but had refused to tell me how he planned on pulling up at my house five minutes after the coast was clear.
 Half of me was strongly tempted to dawdle for fifteen or twenty minutes, but with my luck he'd really manage to show up within the next few minutes, and I'd have to scramble to get ready while he waited for me.
 With a sigh I ran up to the bathroom, brushed my teeth, gave my hair the once-over, and grabbed a light jacket as I left my room.
 It wasn't even remotely as cold here as I would be at home by this late in the year, but the oppressive heat had finally started to wane a little.
 Knowing my luck, if I left it home tonight would be the first time it snowed in Sanctuary in the last two centuries.
 More and more excited about the prospect of going to my first real party, I bounced down the stairs and into the kitchen for a drink.

I realized someone was standing there and distractedly glanced up to see who.
 My instinct to breathe deserted me.
 It was Chevelle Vattier.
 Chapter Three Black Roots
 Chevelle stood there, staring down at me, as I leaned halfway across the table of documents concerning the northern clans.
 Researching him.
 I tried not to betray myself by glancing down at the papers, but the only other place to look was into his eyes, and it felt like that was all I’d found myself doing since I’d first seen him.
 He didn’t look away.
 I had no way of knowing if he’d read the documents before I realized he was there, and I stared at him, frozen for what seemed like an eternity.
 But I was unable to decipher his expression, or guess how I should explain having the documents.

Brandon nodded, staring off in the distance for a second.
 "Yeah.
 It sounds pretentious, but a lot of people depend on my family.
 Half the businesses in the town are owned by my family, the other half are owned by Alec's mother."
 The revelation was a bit of a shock.
 I'd known all along they were both ridiculously rich, but them owning the livelihood of nearly every person in the town was mind-boggling.
 Brandon seemed to know where my thoughts were headed.
 "Pretty amazing, huh?
 Anyways, I've been raised to believe I have an obligation to the town, to the people who work for us.
 Part of that includes making sure other people with substantial resources don't abuse their power."

He had been safe from the bounty on his head and for the most part.
 His life was more boring than anything else.
 He approached the door to the tower roof with the prisoners.
 Instead of formulating a plan of action his mind kept going back to the horror of last week's practice when his master, Ravenhurr, demanded a rehearsal of the ritual ceremony with the senior guards.
 At the time he assumed they would merely walk through the procedure.
 Ravenhurr, however, was the kind of man who demanded perfection.
 He demanded it both in himself and from those around him.
 That perfection required no less than an exact replication of the ceremony.
 As usual, he acceded to his master's wishes and did as he was told.
 He knew the value of following orders and it had kept him alive so far.

“Seth is there something wrong?” I whispered.
 He didn’t answer me again.
 He continued to stare at the woods as if he expected a flying deer to leap out, wearing pink socks.
 “What the heck Seth, are you deaf now?” I waited for a sign that he heard me to appear on his face, but it remained blank.
 Emily huffed loudly, “Expect something from Jazell and me soon Jason.
 We’re out of here.
 See you around.” She grabbed my hand and pulled me away.
 Seth turned to see me leave and the look gave me a dark feeling inside.
 His face was masked with one emotion, one that made me vow to myself that I would find out what he was hiding, what he was keeping a secret.
 That emotion was not Seth, not the one I knew.

I have never had much to give you as an offering of wealth to your temples, nor have I done great deeds in your names, but if any of you hate these life-stealing Immortalists as I do, then let me know your favor.” Rodregas could not help but add a selfish plea to his desperate prayer, “If by your grace I live, then I promise you gods that I will make it my life’s duty to fight the Life Stealers.” Rodregas doubted his prayers would do any good, but if nothing else he was a practical man and when you are pushing the odds it never hurts to call in divine favor.
 Rodregas knew things would start moving quickly now.
 Ravenhurr had been preparing the circles for months, feeding them with unearthly energies.
 Ravenhurr had not wanted the prisoners up on the tower roof until the last moment, lest their fear lead them to take desperate action.
 Ravenhurr started to speak the final words of the spell, setting off months of careful preparations.
 Rodregas knew that sorcerers use ancient languages so that others who might be watching cannot understand what they are saying and guess their intent beforehand.
 During the practice walk-through the week before, Ravenhurr had spoken the same words that he started to utter now.
 Ravenhurr’s deep, melodious voice rumbled out, “Spitualu seperatia orgirgia turia,” and the middle, pale green circle started to burn.
 Rodregas could not pronounce the ancient version of the Eastern Common language Ravenhurr was using, but he thought that he understood the gist of the meaning.
 Rodregas could not believe the man did not try to battle his way out.

Guess what, Les Misérables is coming to Las Vegas.
 Not just a local cast, an actual touring cast out of London.
 It's gotten excellent reviews all over the U.S." I stared at her blankly, unsure where she was going.
 Some of her enthusiasm wilted in the face of my incomprehension.

 You said you loved the music, that it was what made you want to read the book.
 It's playing for more than a month, so there's plenty of time to make arrangements.

 It seemed impossible that she'd be so insensitive to my situation.

The Japanese economy is once again growing and creating new jobs, both at home and abroad, especially in China, which has become the largest destination for Japanese foreign investment and a key supplier base for Japanese manufactured goods.
 China’s economy continues to expand at more than eight per cent annually and India’s may soon achieve that rate of growth.
 Fuelled by very rapid expansion of automotive, financial services, IT, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications, India has emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in the world, the third largest destination for foreign investment, and a key player in IT and IT-enabled services.
 According to a recent study, by 2040 China and India will be the first and third largest economies in the world.
 Together with Russia and Brazil, they could account for a larger portion of world GDP than today’s six largest industrialized nations.
 Population, which was perceived as a liability not long ago, now appears to be an asset.
 In reality, population, like nuclear energy and so many other things, is neutral.
 Its value depends on what we human beings make of it.
 Changing Demographic Profile of the West: Demographic studies indicate that steep declines in the growth of population in Europe, Japan and USA will create acute labour shortages and unprecedented long-term demand for migration of foreign workers or transplantation of work to developing countries.
 UN and other studies estimate that Europe would have to accept 150 million new immigrants over the next 25 years in order to maintain the present levels of working population and Japan would need to admit 600,000 immigrants annually for the next 50 years in order to maintain the size of its working population at the 1995 level.

 Qurrah was in no hurry as he left the city behind.
 The grass was soft and tall, and it felt good under his feet after so much sprinting down stone roads.
 Stars filled the sky, and he smiled to them often.
 In the distance, he spotted a small fire, and he knew to whom it belonged.

CHAPTER FIVE
 Marie woke up with a pounding heart.
 She wanted to go home--she had to get out to the garden right away.
 Jumping out of bed, she dressed as quickly as she could and ran downstairs and into the garden.
 It was just past dawn and not as foggy as it had been yesterday.
 She made herself stop running, certain that speed had nothing to do with going 84 years backwards.
 She began walking in the direction from which she'd come yesterday.
 Or from which she thought she'd come, anyway.
 How would she know if she'd gotten back?
 Surely she'd be able to recognize her own home.

A college boy guarded the parking lot.
 We had to get a note from the office before he would unlock the gate and let us out.
 My gas gauge read empty, and between us we hadn’t enough change to finance the trip to the hospital, which was almost to the mountains, a dozen miles or more.
 So we drove to Cliff and Billy’s house to bum gas money.
 Their mom, Evelyn, called the hospital and learned that Eric was in the operating room, and that no visitors could see him that day.
 She tried to feed and comfort us.
 After those attempts failed, she gave us ten dollars and a shopping list.
 After we staggered through the aisles at the grocery store and delivered the bags to Evelyn, we drove up Mount Helix to the highest place in our town and paced around the big cross in the mountaintop park, staring all around at Mexico, the Pacific, and the Laguna Mountains.
 Every few minutes one of us would offer a reason why Eric couldn’t possibly die.
 He was the strongest person we knew.

 CM:  	Ok, um, the next song on Rain and Other Distractions, the penultimate song, before the finisher, “Goodbye to the Shell,” is this odd little folk song, “Right on Poplar Avenue.”
 BG: 	Yeah, that’s Lor’s song, actually.
 Well, I mean, she didn’t write it, except in the sense that she’s inside my head like no one else.
 That song stems from a conversation we were having about the past, about the future.
 You know, it’s so damn hard to live in the moment, isn’t it?
 I mean, it’s that Zen thing, you know?
 You wanna stay present, but the past keeps intruding.
 “Right on Poplar Avenue,” pun intended, is about this girlfriend I use to have—well, she wasn’t really a girlfriend, I guess—she was one of those people you come up against in your life where you’re just beating your head against a wall.
 For whatever reason you just aren’t connecting.

The remaining elf swore as his eyes grew red and watery.
 He backed away from the half-orc, his sword held defensively before him.
 “What demon magic is this?” he asked.
 “Mine,” said Qurrah.
 And then blood poured out from the face of the lone elf.
 The eyeballs hit the ground before the dead body did.
 “Hurry,” the necromancer said.
 “This is but a taste of what we must do.”
 “Very well,” Harruq said.
 He tried to follow but the pain in his side stopped him.

 He fell sideways, ricocheted off the rail and landed on asphalt.
 Scraped and bruised all over, he went home with Carol, who lived nearby.
 Her parents were gone.
 Whatever they did that afternoon, Eric wouldn’t say.
 But something went wrong, and it sent him into a funk so deep, he gave up the job and asked did I want to go camping up the coast.
 We borrowed surfboards, drove to San Onofre, and pitched a tent on the cliffs.

You haven’t even lived with your family for years now.
 Eugene – Fredric beat me.
 At first he just yelled at me, and beat mom.
 Then after mom disappeared he turned his full wrath to me.
 I think I was five at the time.
 It was like a week after she didn’t come home, he blamed me for it, I don’t remember much after the first few kicks.
 I think I passed out.
 When I woke up it was days later, I think, hard to be sure.
 He just left me to fend for myself, he didn’t care enough to do anything to help, he just left me lying on the floor.
 I still have some of the scars, most have faded, except for some of the burns he gave me.

Man, I wish I could get away with that.”  See, he’s sick of “Like a Rolling Stone.”  He’s trapped, he feels trapped.
 In a way, in one way.
 In another it’s part of him so he can’t deny it, like you can’t deny your arm, or your soul.
 No, I’ll never play, “Young Avenue Blues” again, though it’s a great song.
 And I won’t let anyone else play it like it’s theirs.

 That’s why I got Pete around.
 He’s a demon man, he’s a fucking Cannibal Spirit.

“He has abandoned me,” Qurrah said, pulling at his robes.
 He glanced back to the town, hoping to change the topic.
 Velixar’s gaze followed his, and together they noticed the smell floating in the breeze.
 “There are bodies nearby,” Qurrah said.
 “Hundreds.
 I can feel them.”
 “Elves do not bury their kin,” Velixar whispered.
 “The few tombs they do build house nothing but ash.
 Instead, they pile the bodies of the dead to burn, but not tonight.
 Tonight they mourn.” He stood erect, stretching out his arms as if relishing the warmth of sunshine.

“Well, there’s a good chance they’ll be looking for us.” Of course, and they would all come together.
 It was clear we were too strong for one or two, they would need to attack as a group.
 Or pick us off one by one.
 I wondered how large their force was.
 “Frey?” “Steed?” It wasn’t as funny this time.
 “How did you do it?” I raised my brow, unsure what he was asking.
 “The snake,” he clarified.
 “Oh.
 I… I don’t know.” “Was it transfer magic?
 Did you simply push it there?” I didn’t know how I’d controlled it, but it wasn’t from the outside.

She seemed to have brought together two of the most attractive parts of the AElves and the Nymphs: the slim athletic body of the AElf with the full curves of a Nymph.
 Her skin had a smooth, light golden brown color that often shined with sweat during their practices and looked so soft that it was hard not to reach out and touch it.
 “Did you need something?” asked Imeralda.
 Rodregas had not realized that she had noticed him watching her.
 There was a tease to her voice and expression that said she knew what he was thinking and that she did not mind.
 Rodregas was an experienced man but he was not sure if he had ever seen a woman as beautiful as her, much less thought that he ever had a chance with such a woman.
 He had to smile, amused by his own reaction, as he felt his heartbeat speed up and a rush of heat.
 He had not felt such hormonal surges in a long time.
 He made a decision in his head.
 He had carefully been a gentleman now for several weeks and had not tried anything with the beautiful half AElf, but her teasing expression left him an opening.

You understand, don't you, sweetie?"
 I nodded, and managed a fairly convincing smile.
 "Okay, then.
 Well there's a present for you in the living room, but since you didn't want to celebrate until after school, you'll have to wait to open it."
 I could definitely hear the rumble of a high-performance engine.
 I nodded again, and turned to go, hopeful that I could avoid the inevitable question of why Brandon was coming to pick me up in the mornings as well as dropping me off most afternoons.
 Unfortunately, Mom's hearing was nearly as good as mine, and she was walking towards the windows before I managed to get the door open.
 "Adri, who's that?"
 It was obviously one of those leading questions designed to see whether or not I'd try to lie.
 I shrugged.

He’d bet that she’d been a lot less complicated than the women he knew.
 And she was so beautiful.
 Rick went to bed without having decided anything about an outfit for the dance.
 But for some reason, the young woman from the 1920s was still very much on his mind.
 CHAPTER THREE
 "I said no!"
 Marie stared at her betrothed.
 All she wanted to know was why they couldn't at least have dinner together tonight.
 He'd said he had to work, but it was Friday, and he had to eat anyway.
 But her persistence had made him lose his temper, and now she was rapidly losing hers.

“There,” he said.
 “He returns.”
 Robed in black, the figure approached unseen by the guards.
 He lifted his hands, which shone a pallid white in the fading moonlight.
 So very slowly their color faded, from white, to gray, to nothing, a darkness surrounding and hiding them.
 “What’s going on?” Harruq asked.
 He pulled one of his swords out from its sheath, pleased by the feeling of confidence it gave him.
 Qurrah said not a word.
 His eyes were far away, and his lips moved but produced no sound.
 “Qurrah?” Harruq asked again.

I felt a tap on my shoulder and I looked over.
 Emily held her hand out.
 “Here Jazell, use this to keep your hair out of your face,” she opened her hand and dropped something in my palm.
 I held it up.
 It was a thin, vine that was about a foot long.
 It felt like a ribbon to me and I shrugged.
 I don't usually wear ribbons and bows; that was Emily's style.
 I pulled my hair back and tied the vine.
 It kept my hair out of my face and acted like a rubber band.
 “Thanks Emily,” I said.

"Hold on there.
 Do you always skip breakfast now?"
 Mom had somehow spontaneously developed these weird memories featuring me as a morning person.
 I personally couldn't remember a time when I'd actually liked getting up.
 I didn't necessarily hate the mornings, but we weren't really on a first-name basis.
 More like acquaintances than friends.
 "You both used to be down in the kitchen eating breakfast at the crack of dawn almost every morning.
 Now it's like you don't even want to roll out of bed."
 She used to like mornings.
 I'd tagged along just because it hadn't seemed right to put a damper on such enthusiasm.

 Don’t trust me on that shit.
 I hate that album.
 There’s some good stuff on it.

 But, I’m moving in a totally different direction now.
 I don’t even understand that album, to be honest.
 Have you listened to I Was a Child When Smaller?
 That’s some of my best stuff and what are people saying?
 That it’s self-indulgent.

Rodregas walked over to the bear corpse and as he approached, both cats seemed to fully wake up and took on a crouch stance.
 He pretended to ignore them and pulled one of his short swords out, in a casual way.
 Rodregas kept his focus on the bear; he knew that lionesses in prides do most of the hunting and the alpha males simply ate after the kill was done.
 He started to cut away a large chunk of the bear’s haunch to take back to the barn for their dinner.
 One of the lionesses growled and bit down on the haunch not far from him.
 His heart stopped for a moment.
 Rodregas thought she was going to take his hand for a second.
 With his free hand he made a fist and slammed the side of her head.
 Not with all his strength, but still a serious hit.
 She grunted and let go, growled and stepped over the bear’s body.

Faster and faster the two figures changed places, and then they disappeared.
 It was like my mind was a computer that'd overheated and had to reboot.
 I opened my eyes and met Rachel's worried gaze.
 My pulse was still elevated, and I was breathing too hard.
 It seemed impossible for Britney and Jackie not to hear and realize something was up, but a quick look verified that they were still lost in their respective inner worlds.
 "You just had another fainting spell, didn't you?"
 I felt my eyes go wide.
 Nobody here was supposed to know about that.
 The more people who knew, the more pity I'd see in everyone's eyes.
 All that pity would then make it hard to want to continue fighting, hard to want to do anything other than just curl up in my room so I could avoid them all.

 CM: 	Well, run us through the specifics.
 What happened after the album?
 BG: 	Ok, so we got a local reputation, a sort of groundswell, that started small and then ran along the faultline that runs under the Bluff City.
 We were what they call an underground success, what Memphis specializes in.
 We were talked about but you had to be part of the cognoscenti, the insiders.

My whole body tingled where it touched him, and his cologne, so faint as to be almost imperceptible, was like nothing I'd ever smelled.
 Almost against my will I found myself pressing up against him so I could drink in the scent.
 The music was still way too loud, everyone around us was still ridiculously drunk, but suddenly I couldn't care less.
 Someone tried to come up and talk to Brandon as the next song started, but he waved them off, not even pulling his eyes away from mine.
 I'd thought my heart couldn't race any faster than it already was, but when he started moving his face down closer to mine, it felt like it was going to tear itself free from my chest.
 It was happening.
 I'd fantasized about kissing even back when I thought boys had cooties.
 I wasn't sure I was any more ready than I'd been out in the parking lot, but I could tell by the way he was moving that he wasn't going to abort this time.
 The tingling was even more intense now as I brought my hand up and cupped the side of his face, and then our lips met.
 It wasn't like I'd imagined.

I've been worried all day someone would stump me on something right out of the gate on my first day."
 Rachel looked up at me through dark lashes as I stood.
 "I've wanted to say thanks for a while.
 I really appreciate you making Cassie back down yesterday.
 Nobody else has ever stood up for me like that.
 At least not people that I didn't already know."
 Based on what I'd seen less than thirty hours ago, it didn't look like her friends stood up for her either.
 "No worries, it just seemed like the thing to do at the time.
 Why did she want to hurt you anyways?"
 Rachel looked down, but somehow it wasn't a gesture that conveyed guilt.

I turned toward the fire, tugging the pack tight against my shoulder as I prepared for a graceful exit.
 For departure from food and warmth.
 I jumped a little when the first tree uprooted across the clearing.
 It was only a sapling, but the second and third tree followed.
 “You look like you’ll need shelter, sunshine,” he explained.
 I stared in disbelief as the trees split to form a low lean-to.
 He shot me another wink; I couldn’t be sure he was kidding.
 The tearing and popping noises ceased, and I examined his creation.
 Quite impressive really.
 He didn’t even seem to be watching, let alone concentrating.

 The other two I did not meet until afterwards.” At Rodregas’ response Van’dret stared at him, “You killed an Immortalist Sorcerer by yourself in his tower?
 You truly claim that?” Rodregas almost laughed.
 He did chuckle a bit as he said, “First, you want me to admit that I killed an Immortalist Sorcerer, and when I do, you don’t believe me.
 An old soldier like me just can’t win.” Van’dret was too smart not to pick up his hint, “An old soldier?” he asked very quietly.
 “My turn to ask a question,” said Rodregas.
 “How did you connect the three of us to these crimes?” Van’dret shrugged and smiled and said, “To be honest, I did not really think you were the ones.
 I simply did not like you, and the way you hung out with non-Celestials.
 It is unnatural.
 Now, it is my turn to ask a question.” “Actually,” interrupted Rodregas, “you already asked me about being an old soldier.

 They had two days left, and Marie chose to spend Thursday wandering around downtown Los Angeles, buying trinkets in the shops and the Farmer's Market on Fairfax and watching glamorous people walk by as she and Rick ate lunch at an outdoor café on Rodeo Drive.
 But her choice for their last day in California was quite a change from that: she wanted to go to Disneyland.

Is it right, just, meet?
 What’s the difference?
 At some point, at some fulcrum point, I understood.
 Today, Bob Dylan remains a force in my life, though now, he’s also a pal.
 And I can go to him—to his songs--when I am blue, when I am feeling that the world is a place of malefaction and discommoded energy, when I am feeling that there is nothing to be said for the human race, and I can be readjusted.
 How this happens, why this happens, is secondary to the fact that it does.
 I can listen to “Frankie Lee and Judas Priest” or “Visions of Johanna” or “On the Road Again” or “Clothesline Saga” or “Watching the River Flow” and feel that there are angels within humankind.
 I can feel that we are not all lost in the caliginous wastes of our hopelessly chaotic lives.
 Art redeems us.
 This is the seed I’m seeking, the truth I’m trying in my clumsy way to impart.

Unless you really didn't ever want to go, and were lying to me all along."
 Rachel shrank in on herself a little.
 It almost looked like she was going to cry, which should have made me feel bad, but I was too mad to care.
 I'd been miserable the whole way there, and especially the whole way back, and then she wanted to just pretend like none of it had happened.
 Rachel's lip trembled slightly as she finally managed to get a response out.
 "This isn't like you.
 Why are you doing this?"
 Cindi used to do the exact same thing.
 Her 'woe is me, I don't understand what is happening act' had usually worked with Dad, and it'd always infuriated me.

It wasn't important though.
 Not compared to the first thing I'd faced in hours that had the potential to hurt me.
 I could feel the edge, razor sharp, cleanly parting some of the layers of gauze that'd been wrapped around my emotions.
 It didn't make sense.
 Alec was barely even civil.
 He most definitely wasn't part of the support structure that'd been holding my world in its normal orbit, but suddenly my defenses were in danger of being breached.
 He looked up disinterestedly as I sat in my desk, and even that was enough to send little shivers of near pain coursing through my system.
 It wasn't real pain; I was still too cushioned from the world for that, but my body shied away from it just the same.
 I wanted to run screaming from the room, to jump through a window, to do anything to avoid coming into further contact with someone who so obviously hated me.
 The urges were all very real, but it was like I'd been drugged to the gills.

I got more than friendly with Gloria Valenciana, who was down from Los Angeles camping with her family.
 Her dad made her turn in early.
 When I joined Eric at our campfire, I asked him why he didn’t seem interested in girls.
 “Half of my friends are girls,” he said.
 “You know what I mean.
 Don’t you get horny?” “Yeah,” he said.
 “Only, for me, it’s too soon.
 I’ve got a bunch more to learn.” The last couple months of that summer, while I smashed golf balls, played baseball in Mexico on Sundays, and visited my cousins in Pacific Beach, Eric ran around with Margaret Beasley, Pam Greenman, and Lane Campbell.
 Margaret had been my friend longer than anyone except my cousins.

His best friend was dead.
 Brandon blamed himself for not being there to take care of Tom.
 One of Brandon’s confessions during rehab was that almost all of his friends decided to get as high as they could to attend Tom’s funeral.
 It was the beginning of his excessive drug abuse.
 Chapter 24: Let The Healing Begin As Brandon approached his fifth month as a student at Narconon, he called us and told us he was nearing graduation from the program.
 He also told us he had applied for an internship at the facility and that he wanted to become a drug counselor.
 Brandon told us he wanted to give back and stay on to help others and told us how much better equipped he felt to deal with the world which surrounds us all, but silently haunts a select few.
 The counselors at Narconon had such a profound impact on him that he wanted to have the same impact on others.
 We felt as though we were getting our son back!
 We made the long drive to attend the graduation ceremony with our younger son, Bryce, my mother, my in-laws—who were no longer in the dark— and my brothers.

“Well…” Again he stopped, obviously uneasy about what he wanted to say.
 “It was still dead, but it was moving now.
 That make sense?
 Qurrah could make it do whatever he wanted.
 He let it run off and die, that first one he showed me.
 He was pretty shy about it.
 Don’t think he had any idea how I would react.”
 Harruq suddenly stopped and laughed.
 “You should have seen us, Aurelia.

That is, if I was even a half-ling like the dwarfs claimed I was.
 They laughed and sat in a tight circle mumbling things I didn’t catch.
 My hand slipped to my knife but Emily grabbed my hand to keep me from drawing it from its leather case.
 “No Jazell not yet, maybe we can learn a little more from them.” Her voice was a hoarse whisper.
 “But Emily, it’s awful to listen to.
 Can’t we just destroy the camp?” I went for my bow instead.
 “No,” she said a little more clearly.
 “We have to wait and see what happens.
 Plus, we can’t just randomly attack them.” I didn’t really care.

The United Nations has, over the years, devoted great time and attention to the issues before the Commission on Peace and Food.
 In the research, analysis, debate, consensus-building and actual operational activities of the United Nations System, the issues of peace, develop ment and democratization have been at the forefront.
 The Members of the International Commission on Peace and Food have interacted closely with the United Nations Funds, Programmes and Specialized Agencies.
 This report brings together many of the issues which are central to the reflection on development which the United Nations is trying to encourage, leading to the World Summit on Social Development to be held in 1995.
 Boutros Boutros-Ghali Secretary General United Nations
 The report of the International Commission on Peace and Food focuses on the 'uncommon opportunities' that have arisen as the world shifts into new alignments.
 These include the chance to tackle the problems of hunger and injustice at the root of so many of the global challenges confronting us not the least, the overriding challenge of nurturing a worldwide culture of peace.
 The Commission has put people first, recognizing that the greatest potential for change is within us, that with education and information we can mobilize the vast amounts of energy and skill which are currently wasted in the scramble for survival.
 It, nevertheless, also accepts that there are no easy solutions and that concerted action is necessary on many fronts in order to untangle the tortuous connections between, for instance, defence spending and food security, for no country can truly be said to be at peace while the violence of hunger blights the life of its citizens.
 ICPF has no hesitation in putting forward ideas that are bound to unsettle, and it should be encouraged since imagination and daring are precisely what we need at the present time.

A painful fear shot through me, and I tilted my head forward to run through the growth.
 Vines, thorns and leaves turned to muddy ash as they touched my outstretched arms, wet with rain.
 When I reached the edge of the onetime garden, I stopped to kneel, digging my fingers deep into the soil to form a trench.
 When I saw the bared roots, black and rotted, I was suddenly exhausted.
 It was too much.
 It took me to that familiar, mindless place, and I turned to walk toward home, void of any sensation save the slow rain on my skin.
 When I entered the house, Fannie was there, but I only trudged past her on the way to my room.
 I barely took notice of her expression, her tight grin and suspicious eyes as she took in my mud-streaked clothes, dripping hair.
 I didn’t speak; I was spent and I just couldn’t make myself care.
 In the dark of my room, I collapsed onto the bed, dropping asleep to the thrum of falling rain.

While it didn't sound like anyone was out-and-out yelling, they weren't the calm voices of friendly conversation.
 I quickly reversed direction, and found an external door less than a minute later.
 The voices had faded away to nearly nothing as I'd gotten further away from them, but all of a sudden they peaked into a full-blown yelling match, punctuated with an incredible crash that sent a tremor through the entire house.
 Any thoughts I'd had about trying to find a phone and calling 911 vanished as full flight instinct took a hold.
 A few seconds later I was outside and running.
 The moon was so obscured by clouds it provided only minimal light, but even the poor visibility couldn't convince me to slow my flight through the near jungle waiting outside the house.
 I could barely make out the stone path that led through the garden, but I stumbled along it as quickly as I could with my sprained ankle, deciding between branches in the path completely at random.
 I'd only been running for a few seconds when lightning tore its first gash in the night sky and opened up the way for a monsoon-like rainstorm.
 Within a few seconds the cold rain was falling so hard that I couldn't see even a few feet ahead of me.
 I started shivering instantly.

 As the two brothers left, another soul traveled in the dark.
 He made not a sound as he moved.
 Any attempts at tracking his passage would be utterly futile, for not a single blade of grass remained bent when his foot stepped away.
 He was Dieredon, Scoutmaster of the Quellan elves, and few souls could match his silence, speed, or skills with blade and bow.
 When the village came into view of his eagle-like eyes, his gut sank.

Harruq flung the dying body around by the neck.
 The sword buried up to the hilt in the makeshift shield.
 Harruq dropped the dead elf and lashed out.
 His backhand broke the elf’s jaw.
 Reeling, the elf staggered back, only able to raise his meager arm above his head.
 Harruq smashed an elbow into his chest, followed by knuckled fists atop his skull.
 “Stay down,” Harruq said.
 He retrieved Salvation and Condemnation from the dirt, and then stomped over to the beaten, bloody elf warrior.
 “Mercy, I am beaten,” the elf gasped as Harruq lifted his head by the hair.
 “No such thing,” he said.

His brother nodded.
 “Velixar’s nightmares have pulled them from their slumber.

 “Are you ready, brother?”
 “I am,” he lied.

The sheer shock at still being alive prevented my mind from working very well.
 It took several minutes before all of the other relatively inconsequential details started filtering in.
 My hands were bandaged, as was my elbow and right calf.
 My dirty, ripped jeans and shirt had been replaced with clean clothes that were only a little too small.
 That last fact should have alarmed me more than it did.
 Somehow being stripped down by a stranger paled in comparison to a near-death hallucination involving wolves and a monster straight out of a science fiction movie.
 The bedroom was possibly the nicest room I'd ever been in.
 A movie star or millionaire would have had a hard time topping this place for sheer decadence.
 The walls were paneled in some kind of rare, doubtless expensive imported hardwood.
 The bookcases that covered the majority of the wall space seemed to be made out of the same kind of wood, and were filled with more books than I'd seen in the local bookstore the one time I'd convinced Britney to stop by on our way home after school.

Though the two fanciest robes both heavily embroidered and of Western Silk, also went to the bed.
 Next, he went to the trunk which was made of High Cedar wood and which matched the large wardrobe, but was much more portable.
 Unfortunately, the only items of use in it were several blankets of good quality wool.
 The remaining contents consisted of drawings, pictures and other personal items.
 Rodregas dumped the trunk contents on the floor, sandwiched the armor in the blankets and loaded up the trunk.
 How he was going to cart the trunk out of the tower he did not yet know.
 He went to the door and listened; it seemed to be getting quieter.
 It was the middle of the night and the stir from the ceremony seemed to have subsided, but it was only hours until dawn when everyone would be heading out to celebrate the new ‘birth’ of Ravenhurr.
 Not a true celebration for most; as their lord and master, ‘he’ was more feared than loved.
 Rodregas locked the door to prevent a surprise.

Rodregas took off his harness and boots and grabbed the ridges of the bark.
 He had climbed walls where you stuck your toes in the crack left by old mortar worn away.
 The bark of the tree, like the rest of the tree, was on an epic scale and actually provided good leverage for climbing.
 He did not look at how high he had to go, but instead simply started to climb.
 The climb took far longer than he hoped and he could not see Imeralda as he climbed.
 He was finally getting close to the first of the branches of the tree when he heard Doi’van yell.
 “Rodregas, what in the name of the Celestial Winds are you doing?” He paused in his climb, his toes caught in the bark.
 Rodregas could feel the wetness of blood on his toes and he felt like he was going to slip at any moment.
 He breathed deep and yelled, “I am climbing the damn ‘One Tree,’ what does it look like?
 Now, shut up before I fall.”  He continued his climb, finally reaching a branch.

Alec shrugged.
 "A paltry sum if it helps ensure a perfect night for you."
 "You've done so much.
 I mean the dress, the shoes, and now this.
 Thank you, but you really shouldn't have."
 His smile was back, and for some reason it nearly pulled tears out of me.
 "I'm glad you like it.
 The fact that everyone else gets to participate is nice, but really it's all for you.
 Of course I did make a couple of stipulations."
 The music started up before I could ask what he meant.

It bothered me, and I didn’t think it was because of my conscience.
 When he reached the end of the book, it returned to its home on the shelf and he stood, placing a hand briefly on the top of my head.
 It was only a momentary touch, but electricity surged though me.
 A flash of confusion or frustration passed over his features, too fast to identify.
 He looked into my eyes one last time as I sat, stunned and speechless, my skin still tingling from the contact.
 “Enough for today,” he said, nodding as he turned, his long strides taking him too quick from my view.
 I sat motionless as I watched him go, and remained so for some time after.
 I hadn’t realized how exhausted I’d been.
 When I finally rose to leave, I stashed a few more of the northern clan documents from the table under my shirt.
 My head was swirling with all that had happened, not simply my new tutor but the magic.

As my watcher, Chevelle would have been involved in the binding by Council.
 Maybe Fannie should have been punished for whatever she had done, but how could they assume I would follow in her footsteps?
 So I’d killed a bird, stolen a few papers from the council library.
 My argument faltered, so I went back to anger, betrayal that he had lied to me.
 And not just him.
 The entire village must have known I was bound, known I couldn’t perform magic, as they sat and watched me try.
 Sending me to Junnie for lessons, allowing Evelyn to taunt me without recourse, giving me the blame for everything that happened.
 Because they expected me to turn.
 The horses slowed to a stop, irritating me further.
 I didn’t even have control over that.

At the same time there are a number of positive factors that offer opportunities to increase productivity significantly in the near to middle term.
 Closing the productivity gap
 A survey comparing the levels of productivity for major crops between countries reveals a wide disparity between proven technological potentials and actual field results for every crop.
 Cereal yields in Western Europe and North America average 4.5 tons per hectare, compared to three tons in Asia, 2.3 tons in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, two tons in Latin America and slightly more than one ton in Africa.
 The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) projects a 40 per cent increase in wheat yields in 92 developing countries, excluding China, by 2010.
 In rice, countries with widely differing climatic conditions, such as Australia, Korea, Egypt, Spain, Japan and Italy, achieve average yields nearly double the world average and two to three times the yields achieved in countries such as India, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.
 Total rice yields in 92 developing countries are expected to rise to 37 per cent by 2010.
 Maize yields in Greece, Chile, Austria, Italy and Germany average more than double the world average, and five to six times the averages achieved in large maize-producing countries such as India.
 Even comparing areas under irrigated maize, average yields range from 1.5 to 8.4 tons per hectare.
 New varieties of maize are under development that yield 30 per cent more grain in a drought season than conventional varieties.

The process of sorting the books and then getting them to burn took several hours and he started to feel how long it had been since his new body had slept.
 The sound of the tower was changing, the first sounds of the kitchen crew getting ready for the morning.
 Still he kept at it, though there seemed to be nothing else of wealth in the room.
 He was determined to see the evil books burn.
 They held the secrets to the Immortalist art and other dark magic.
 Leaving them would only lead to another person rising in Ravenhurr’s place.
 Several of the foulest books seemed to refuse to burn but the flames eventually consumed all, just as they had consumed Ravenhurr.
 Finally, the last of the dark books of magic were burned, and the few remaining books that felt of magic but lacked the evil stench of the others were packed in the trunk.
 Only six volumes had been free of the stench, while over forty were burned.
 The sun was now streaming into the room and he was feeling the lack of sleep.

Harruq ripped his blade out of the guard’s chest and shoved the body to the side.
 The dying heap of flesh collided against two other men, knocking them back and delaying their attack.
 He mocked them, adrenaline flooding his veins.
 “Is that all you can do?” he screamed.
 “Where’s the fun in this?”
 “Here’s your fun,” one said, stabbing at Harruq’s side from behind.
 The blade punctured the black armor and bit into flesh.
 The half-orc roared, and then twisted so fast it left the expert guard breathless.
 His upper body jerked left to prevent the sword from going in any further.
 Salvation swung around, ringing against the blade.

After all, you can't really expect to do everything by yourself.
 Occasionally a helping hand is exactly what's called for."
 The words reached inside me, pulling on something that was already bleeding, tearing it further.
 The classroom rocked back and forth at the same time my legs lost the ability to support my weight.
 Alec lunged toward me, moving incredibly quickly as my mind spun away back to our kitchen table.
 I was fourteen and trying to understand geometry proofs.
 Mom had given up trying to help me with homework about the time I turned twelve, so she kept telling me to just read the book and figure out what they were doing in the examples.

It’s called ‘A Weekend in Nirvana’ and is the artist’s idea of what Heaven might feel like.

 Sorry, I thought you were talking about me again.
 What is odd about that painting?
 Karen – Well, it seems like most people would paint what they think Heaven would look like, clouds and angels and harps and buildings that look like Greek Temples.
 People don’t usually touch on what it might feel like.
 That painting looks bright and warm, I like it.

 Ruby came through the door, in a movement that could nearly have been classified as whirling.
 “Come on, Steed.
 We need to set you up outside of town.
 Chevelle is afraid we’re causing a scene in the village.” She laughed lightly.
 It seemed like she was having fun.
 I wondered if that meant she was causing trouble.
 “Don’t think he trusts you with the girl,” Ruby added, smiling playfully.
 “I prefer the outdoors anyway.” Steed dipped toward me, his hand folding his waist in a bow as he stood to go.

 “I’m afraid we will have to use your anger,” she said, a smile creeping into the corner of her lips.
 “It seemed to work with your lunch.” I remembered the meat I had burnt and flushed.
 “Yes, this will do,” she hummed with a sly grin.
 “Let me see… yes, I’ve got it.” She began stepping a slow circle around me, talking as she moved, suddenly cat-like.
 “The dreams you had after the fairy dust, do you remember them?” Oh.

He was covered by many of the Mid-South’s biggest stars.
 And later by some of the country’s:  Elvis Costello did “Lemmy Caution’s Incubus.”  Van Morrison made “Blues for Sid and Shirley” a staple of his live performances.
 Led Zeppelin, for God’s sake, did “Procapé All Night,” Jimmy Page being an early fan, as is written.
 Just for the record Buddy wrote these hits for other stars:  “Buttermilk Thighs,” “Blues for Sandra Leathers,” “Wrong for the Right of Way,” “Arcade Late-Night Blues,” “Open Channel D,” “The Sins of Monk Cassava,” “They Bribe the Lazy Quadling,” “Patience Hell, I’m Gonna Kill Something,” “The Nice and the Good,” “Strawberry Fields for Only a Little While,” “Take me for Granted, Please,” “Surfing the Big Muddy,” “The Rules for Hide and Seek,” “Young Avenue Blues,” “Picnic in Overton Park,” “Chin-Chin in Eden,” “Turn on Your Love Lights but Turn that Damn Stereo Down,” and on and on.
 Buddy and the boys were off and running.
 Soon they were one of the most sought after acts, playing gigs everywhere the area offered, in clubs, at outdoor festivals (happenings), and, of course, their famous half-aborted rooftop gig on top of the Sterick Building downtown.
 Officer Mike “Mooncalf” Milton, one of the arresting officers, recalls to this day how polite Buddy and the band were as they were being ushered into police cars while the mob roared.
 “Buddy Gardner was a gentleman in a jerk business,” Officer Milton remembers.
 This mildness, this Southern gentleman perception, follows Buddy to this day.
 It’s hard to find someone to speak ill of him, even those he later abandoned or stepped on on his way to the top.

When Britney stomped over and asked if I was done, I considered telling her I needed ten more minutes.
 Her being an attention hog didn't justify me being petty though.
 I just nodded instead and packed up my stuff.
 The ride home was completely uneventful, and mercifully brief.
 Britney was one of those people who drive fast normally, and even faster when they are pissed off.
 Apparently having to stay after school to study merited twenty-five over the speed limit.
 I normally would have complained--I'd become much more sensitive about speeding in the last couple of months, but I was anxious to get home, and very much not feeling like there was anything particularly special to live for.
 Not that I was suicidal, contrary to Mom's unvoiced, but obvious fears.
 I just didn't have much of anything to look forward to.
 It wasn't until Britney's Saturn was nearly out of sight that I realized our Jeep Cherokee was parked in the driveway.

 “I’m doomed,” Harruq said, ignoring her.
 “Oh, the agony.

 “Never thought a half-orc dying could be so adorable.”
 His eyes flared wide.
 “I’m not!” he insisted.
 She slid over beside him, her long hair cascading toward his face.
 “Oh, but I think you are,” she said.

The elf nodded.
 “Is it a safe assumption that you don’t know how to read?”
 Harruq frowned at the book.

She was still in 2011.
 "Rick!"
 She could hear him hurrying toward her, and she turned to meet him.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, hugging her close.
 Tears rolled down her cheeks, and she choked back a sob.
 She missed her mother.

I'd been amazed at its lush beauty the couple of times I'd snuck back during the daylight.
 Neither of those compared to what greeted me now.
 Soft light came from dozens of floating lamps that'd been placed in the pool, all of which gave off an aching, white luminescence that seemed perfectly matched to the brilliant white of the rose petals scattered over the surface of the water.
 It wasn't until we got closer that I could make out the purple edging to the petals.
 "Lagrimas."
 Alec's voice was husky.
 "Nothing else would be appropriate.
 Not for you, not tonight."
 As we continued forward I was able to make out the other additions to the grotto.
 The hundreds of petals had been joined by a dozen of their potted sisters.

Jim – Tabloids?
 You’ve never read the special edition series or Sumo Assassin, it’s even worse than most tabloids, they don’t even bother to make full sentences or finish thoughts.
 Which is damn near impossible to accomplish without trying to do so.
 Karen - But if you can show that much loyalty to something so terrible for so long, well Elizabeth is a lucky woman.
 Art – Lucky to have won the loyalty of a dork like my son.
 Jim – You’re telling me.
 She must have accumulated some bad Karma?
 Karen – Well aside from reading Sumo Assassin, what do you enjoy doing?
 (Liz enters, carrying one last serving bowl behind Karen and Art, Jim can see her)
 Jim – Well, I like sitting and lying down on this couch, watching television, playing video games, and when she lets me, touching Elizabeth’s breasts.

My brother Thomas and I had become very good at yard work and chores as we learned to perform them with perfection or pay the price of Dino’s disappointment.
 Every weekend was filled with hours upon hours of yard work at Dino’s command.
 If we ran out of work to do, Dino would have us move a scrap woodpile from one end of the backyard to another, then back again if he wasn’t done with us.
 Sometimes Dino would stand in the backyard and direct us with a garden hose nozzle, spraying us from one chore to the next.
 Dino was sick.
 We never knew when we were going to get knocked across the room.
 We were often treated like unwanted animals.
 We wondered why this was happening to us but at the same time we wondered if the same thing was happening in the families across the street.
 Our half-brother, Harry (named after Dino’s father) was soon born.
 Then, my stepfather had even less regard for us as we were now second-class citizens to his “real” son.

 The dream shattered.
 Amid the haze of red and black, he heard the cries of battle urging him on, offering him a future he had always feared and desired.
 A life of killing and battle.
 A life given to Karak.
 An orcish life.
 The icy fingers left his forehead.
 “It is a select few who have received such a gift,” Velixar said in the quiet night.

 Jim – Well… A Journal… A diary… Journals aren’t pink.

“I thought I'd get some support from you, Seth.” He crossed his arms.
 “You might be next, you know.” Seth shrugged.
 “Maybe, but I don't care.
 We all need a good laugh to keep our spirits up and if that means scaring the crap out of me, I'm fine with it.” “So you'll be fine with me dragging you outside while you were sleeping and leaving you in the rain?” Emily asked.
 Seth narrowed his eyes.
 “No, I'd be cold, wet and annoyed.
 You can do that if you feel like having me be grouchy all day.” “Nah,” Emily said.
 “I don't think it would be worth it.” “Are we just going to sit here and talk or are we going to get a move on?” I asked.
 “Alright then,” Emily said and walked out of the cave.
 “If you want to go in the dreary woods so bad, we'll go.” Jason walked after her, shoulders hunched.

Soaked in blood, Harruq turned to the remaining guards and bellowed like the mad beast he was.
 The remaining two facing him were trained well.
 They held firm when Harruq charged, and stayed close together.
 Because of this, they managed to survive the initial onslaught.

Now that she'd finally broached the subject, Britney was unstoppable.
 "It had to have been a mountain lion, there isn't anything else around here that's both aggressive and big enough to kill people, but neither of them had been gnawed on at all, which was strange enough by itself.
 Everyone refusing to talk about it would've been enough to make it X-Files weird, but when the coroner threw such a fit, it entered a class of its own."
 Britney looked around again to make sure nobody was in hearing range, and then leaned in even closer.
 "He said the wounds weren't made by anything in the cat family.
 He wrote up a whole paper on how the teeth marks were made by some kind of new, previously undiscovered predator."
 The chills were back, and they'd redoubled in intensity.
 It was like the howl from my dream was echoing through my soul.
 "Did he say what it was like?

His attackers backed off, confused by the fact that he had gone from being their prisoner to suddenly rising.
 The person pinning Rodregas’ left arm got too far away.
 This gave Rodregas the leverage he needed to pull the arm free.
 He punched his assailant hard in the face.
 The attacker flew back and Rodregas jumped sideways to get more space.
 Rodregas rested his right hand on the knife blade still sticking out of his stomach.
 He was relieved to feel that it was not too deep.
 He had not taken off his armor.
 Although the knife had pierced the leather weave, the tip penetrated less than an inch.
 Rodregas gritted his teeth and pulled the knife free.

I didn't even want to guess at how much weight was in each basket, but as Alec cleared the door it was obvious that the slow speed that he'd been moving at had only been due to him not wanting to hit anything.
 He moved like they weighed no more than a couple of pillows as he crossed the cabin and set them down in front of what must be the food pantry.
 "That was almost as quick as normal."
 Alec nodded in response to Mallory's observation.
 "I've been lifting weights for a while, but present circumstances dictated a more aggressive program."
 He opened the door to the pantry, and started putting cans away, but Mallory waved him off.
 "You'll put them in the wrong spots.
 Just leave that, and I'll put it away later.
 Don't go all mulish on me, I may be old and feeble, but I'm still able to move a can of food.
 Come over here and let me look at you."

"Yes," she breathed.
 He'd never kissed her arm before.
 When he was gone, she dropped onto her bed with a smile.
 But it slowly became a frown.
 She was beginning to think she didn't understand her betrothed at all.
 She'd never seen him get angry before he’d proposed.
 And she'd thought that being betrothed would mean they'd spend more time together, but they were actually spending less time together.
 He had dinner with her family two or three times a week, but he and her father always retired to her father's study for the rest of the evening.
 And they'd only gone out alone twice.
 Considering the pattern of the past five weeks, Marie was thrilled when Davis told her that he was taking her out to dinner the next Friday evening.

 I’m confused, it’s usually either one or the other.

"You're still here."
 "You sound disappointed.
 Do you want me to leave?"
 His expression had taken on the guarded blankness I still hadn't learned how to read, so I wasn't sure whether he was joking or not.
 "No, not disappointed, just surprised.
 I figured I'd wake up and find everything had just been one amazing, crazy dream."
 I'd hoped that my reassurance would make the mask drop, but if anything Alec was looking at me even more seriously.
 "Would you prefer things to take that course?"
 It took me several heartbeats to understand what he was getting at, long seconds in which his face grew increasingly remote.
 "No, how could you think that?

The floors were a gorgeous marble which drew the eyes to the nearest golden-white wall, and up the elaborate gilded trim towards vaulted ceilings.
 It was like walking into a palace, complete with painted, spun-sugar clouds, and burgundy drapes made out of rich velvet.
 If it wasn't for the press of people pushing me from behind, I probably would've stayed in the front entryway right up until the sound of the orchestra filtered down to me.
 As it was, I only got a few hurried looks before being rushed along with the rest of the students.
 Seeing all of my classmates looking utterly bored as they allowed themselves to be herded through the most amazing building I'd ever seen brought me back to my original train of thought.
 I hadn't actually spent every waking moment thinking about Les Misérables.
 A fair number of those seconds had been spent with Brandon.
 He'd already been picking me up from school every morning and dropping me off most days.
 We now spent every lunch together, and he'd started lingering when he dropped me off.
 It was still only on the days when Mom wasn't home, and I hadn't quite mustered the guts to invite him in, but it'd still been really nice.

To her delight, she saw that he was going to kiss her.
 She closed her eyes, savoring the anticipation and then the sweetness of his lips on hers.
 When, after a few seconds, he didn't end the kiss, her heartbeat sped up.
 He'd never kissed her this long before.
 But her eyes flew open when she felt his hand slide under her skirt to squeeze her thigh.
 Panicking, she tried to push him away.
 But he pinned her against the back of the sofa, his mouth becoming rough.
 She tried to break away from him because he was kissing her so hard that her teeth were cutting into her lips; she could taste the blood.
 But he wouldn't let her go.
 And then he pushed his tongue into her mouth, and shock and disgust fused with the pain to give her the strength to shove him away.

Four of us split off, two up the canyon, two down.
 When we got beyond his range, we climbed, intending to circle above him.
 Such a fury possessed us, we might have stoned him to death.
 Except Eric and Steve had gone straight up the hillside.
 At first they dodged the barrage Tom threw.
 Then he stopped raging, held still for a moment, and sank to kneeling on the ledge.
 Probably he hadn’t slept in two nights.
 Because Eric and Steve had shamed us with their courage and merciful hearts, we let them bring Tom down the hillside to the shade of the grotto.
 Later I heard Eric coaching Tom that he should refuse to stuff the pain of his hurt feelings inside, because in there, it had no choice but to fester or explode.
 When the hospital released my mom, she could hardly cook, wash dishes, or attempt disciplining me.

“Well, and then I got lost.
 Sorry.” Aunt Fannie was incensed, her curses flying out in a rant that felt as if it would never end.
 The years of listening to it seemed to coalesce, and I was suddenly exhausted.
 “I think I’ll go lie down.” “Do you think you can just sleep when you want to sleep?
 Whose tree do you think this is?
 You’ll lie down when I say you’ll lie down…” I bit down on a groan, eyes running over the wood grain of the table as I tuned her out.
 I knew the outcome if I didn’t, and I was already in trouble enough.
 Shortly after her tirade insisting I stay until I had earned permission to leave, the one-sided argument ran its course and Fannie tired of looking at me and sent me on my way.
 I trudged out of the kitchen, through the main sitting area, and into my room.
 It was dark except for a small beam of light from a knothole in the wall.

He has had a solid relationship with both of our boys and that could translate into communication.
 This Thanksgiving we had an agenda that didn’t include turkey and all the trimmings.
 Agenda Item One: Get our son’s belongings out of his rental house.
 The landlord met me, Lisa, Harry, Harry’s wife Anabel, and a shaking miserable Brandon at the house, and I felt sorry for the owner of this home.
 He was a deeply religious man accompanied by his mousy wife and perfectly groomed daughter, all dressed in their Sunday best on their way home from church.
 He had believed all of Brandon’s lies, trusted my son and his roommates and ended up landlord of a drug den.
 He was devastated to see the condition of his property but he was strangely calm and understanding.
 He simply wanted our help to get Brandon’s belongings out of his house and fix things as best we could.
 He gave us an offer we couldn’t refuse.
 If we would get everything out by the evening and pull out all of the carpet, he would not pursue damages.

This is of particular importance where regional peace and stability is at stake, as in the Middle East, over the question of access to water supplies.
 Where national environmental resources may lead to dispute and conflict, agreements should be drawn up between potential belligerents and the good offices of the UN's specialized agencies used to anticipate and avert future conflict.
 Peace and democracy can provide only the foundation for stable and productive social life, not its fulfilment.
 For that, political security has to be complemented by economic security and a blossoming of individual and cultural potentials.
 Yet here our optimism seems to flag.
 Our thoughts of the new millennium do evoke images of greater peace and stability internationally, more individual freedom and democratic rights, growing international co-operation, exciting new technologies, increasing cultural interaction.
 But they also evoke images of more people and less work – meaning fewer jobs!
 No sooner has the threat of nuclear annihilation receded, than the spectre of chronic unemployment and unrelenting poverty has risen to replace it, giving renewed justification to humanity’s deepest anxieties by transferring them to a new source of apprehension.
 In recent years, unemployment has emerged as a major cause of concern for governments around the world.
 In industrial countries, the subject evokes pessimistic prophecies of a fast-approaching future in which tens of millions of people will never find jobs, technology eliminates the need for human labour, cheap imports replace domestic jobs, welfare systems collapse under an unbearable burden, children have less economic opportunity than their parents, a widening abyss divides the rich and poor, and both markets and governments are powerless to do anything about it.

I glared at Chevelle’s back, but he was already galloping away.
 I reached out with magic, drawing Steed’s head around to press him back to me, climbed up, and clicked my heels hard to catch Chevelle.
 He was riding too fast again and I was not looking forward to the day, sure it would be worse than the already miserable morning.
 I rode up beside him, planning a snide remark about the trick, but was distracted by a black stone in his hand.
 It was odd-shaped and just smaller than my balled fist.
 Onyx, I thought, though I’d never seen the stone that big.
 His gaze was intent.
 “Be prepared at all times.
 This will come at you from every direction.
 It is the only way you can learn to respond quickly.

“Are you in pain?” “No.
 Not anymore.” He nodded.
 “What do you remember?” “I was—” I faltered.
 I didn’t know why, but I felt protective of this secret.
 I didn’t want to tell anyone I was in my horse’s mind.
 I started again, aware of my annoyed tone.
 “I don’t know.
 I was just following you guys and then wham!” That pretty much summed it up.
 “Just pain and screeching.” Ruby and Steed bolted to their feet as someone came in, but it was only Grey.
 “What is it?” Chevelle said, still kneeling over me.

I wandered toward the briar patch, finding it easily.
 It hadn’t been far, despite my exhaustion.
 I crawled through the narrow path I’d made the previous time.
 It hadn’t seemed such a tight fit in only pants.
 I settled in, jerking a length of skirt free from the thorns with a spray of colorless beads.
 Brushing the loose dirt off the papers I had buried, I laid the soiled documents across my lap and untied the laces binding them together.
 I stared at the words on the ancient parchment, unable to believe what I was reading was true.
 It had to be; it was signed with the official seal, staring back at me from the smudged white fabric of my skirt, the letters on the page as real and words as patent as they could be.
 The documents held the details of a trial, and not only a trial, a punishment.
 The punishment of Francine Katteryn Glaforia, found guilty of practicing dark magic.

His thoughts had traveled in a similar direction.
 “I have been thinking about what you said about it making sense for me to get a greater sigil.
 I have more magic than I need.
 There is only one other group besides the Guild that has is allowed to give sigils, the Knights of the Soaring Heavens; from who the Gods choose their champions.” Imeralda and Doi’van had both become quite intrigued by what Rodregas was hinting at.
 He continued, “I was a squire in the Knighthood who was never raised.
 As you probably know most squires are not raised, only those of the most noble blood and those of greatest talent in both magic and the arts of a warrior.
 I was neither.
 I had thought that I would make a career in the army,” he paused after admitting that.
 His time as a squire was like magic to him, and his time in the army had been a living nightmare.
 “Once a year directly after the new group of knights is raised, a great competition is held; a five days open tournament.

Severe fiscal constraints have forced governments to reduce drastically budgetary allocations to research institutions, leaving most of these institutions with little or no source of revenues to support their activities.
 High priority must be given to developing a detailed plan for preservation of the scientific research infra structure during the difficult transition period and for restructuring it so that it can be integrated effectively into the emerging market system.
 The drain of talents must be stopped by a concerted national effort to exploit each country's competitive advantage in science by marketing these capabilities internationally, and particularly by linking up with other countries in the region and with developing countries that can most benefit from the region's scientific and technological capabilities.
 Search for a New Model
 Ironically, despite all the international debate about transition, thus far the actual goal of the transition process has never been clearly spelled out.
 It is widely presumed to be to some form of capitalist system, but which variety – the Swedish?
 The Japanese?
 The American?
 Although the ostensible goal of transition has been to economies based on private ownership, three years after the initiation of transition programmes, very little privatization has actually taken place in most countries of the region.
 It is widely believed that acceleration of this process will lead to rising unemployment and a widening gap between the rich and the poor, leading to the creation of a huge under class that had been virtually eradicated in previous decades.

 The foot smashed the bottom of Harruq’s chin, the same sore part Dieredon had hit.
 Harruq staggered back, his sword swinging wildly.
 The elf charged in, knowing he outmatched the half-orc in speed and skill.
 The kill would be his.
 “ _Hemorrhage._ ”
 A sudden purging of blood vessels exploded across Ahrqur’s side.
 The force smashed him into a decorative table.
 He rolled off the broken thing and glanced down at the blood soaking his robe.
 Despite the wound, no cut or hole was visible in the cloth.

Developing countries will cut agricultural tariffs by an average of 24 per cent.
 In addition, North American and Western European countries have agreed to cut agricultural subsidies by one-third.
 Together these cuts are expected to result in a 20 per cent rise in exports of agricultural and processed foods by 2005.
 The share of developing countries in this increase has been estimated at $20 billion to $60 billion annually.
 Increased trade can act as a strong stimulus to the growth of agricultural, agro-industrial and rural employment, provided that these countries respond dynamically to the opportunity by raising productivity and strengthening rural infrastructure for storage, processing and distribution.
 However, rising demand within developing countries themselves will limit overall growth of exports, and increasing exports will push up domestic food prices, unless much greater priority is given to matching production with opportunities for home and external trade.
 Increased private investment
 The modernization of the farm sector greatly needs the investment, technology, professional management and marketing expertise which private firms can bring.
 Wherever land reforms have resulted in the division of farms into small parcels, farmers need to be supported by well-organized services, particularly for post-harvest handling, provided either by companies or co-operatives.
 Economic liberalization offers expanded opportunities for private enterprise to work with small producers in a wide range of agro-industries to combine the social benefits of small holdings with the economies and marketing expertise of corporate management.

I had plenty to think of besides the questions that had seemed so important the previous day.
 I’d been convicted of practicing dark magic.
 I had thought it was a mistake.
 The images rolled through my mind as we continued up the mountain.
 The lifeless body of a small gray bird.
 A garden of weeds with roots as black as soot.
 The faces of council as their speaker struggled to breathe.
 A thistle growing in Evelyn’s throat, slowly choking off her airway.
 Chevelle’s face when he had asked who had showed me to fuse the crystal with blood.
 His expression as he’d looked down at me the night before.

Johnny – The beatings.
 I mean.
 With all the crap that mom pulled, well, she never once hit me.
 She was never that bad.
 I hate her for what she did.
 But, compared to what Gene’s dad did it isn’t worth complaining about.
 Jim – Yep.
 Johnny – How long have you known?
 Jim – About what?
 Johnny – About Gene and his asshole father.

Harruq thrust out his chin and squinted.
 “This was how that Perry guy looked.
 Seen dogs look more human.
 He was strong, and I think he was the strongest before I showed up.
 I told him about this contest me and Qurrah made up, some arm wrestling thing.
 Guy was drunk out of his mind, so when I told him we could win four gold coins he should have figured something was off.
 “We met after work, just past sundown, and I led him straight to Qurrah, who cast a spell on Perry then, kind of like you did with the guards.
 He shouted until his head turned purple but made no sound for the effort.
 Then Qurrah cast another spell that made him go all tough and rigid.
 Felt like I was holding a stick.

Spanish went about like I'd expected.
 There was a brief discussion on a new grammar concept, some vocabulary, and a whole lot of television.
 Britney caught up with me at my locker, still complaining that she was going to have to start doing her homework instead of trying to flirt with football players.
 "It's completely unfair.
 Nobody else's parents get called.
 It's like I'm back in grade school and have to deal with parent-teacher conference every month.
 I thought the whole point of high school was to give us the chance to start making some of our own decisions."
 I grunted something noncommittal as we turned the corner.
 It probably wouldn't have been good enough to save me from having to actually say something, but Brandon was leaning against a wall.
 "I thought it much safer to stay in one place and wait for you rather than wander around and risk getting knocked down."

“Yes, well, that would have been easy enough.” “And Junnie prefers to hunt… for sport?” He had that look again and I wondered why he would be so cautious.
 Because I was dangerous?
 A practitioner of dark magic?
 “No.
 Some prefer the meat not to be tainted by magic.
 They feel it is more… pure.” He pronounced ‘tainted’ with an edge.
 “Is it?
 Tainted I, mean?” “I have lived on it for—” His words caught midsentence and he said, “Well, it doesn’t seem to be, but to each his own.” He turned back to the fire.
 Junnie came back into view, a large animal slung over her shoulders, bow in hand.
 She dropped her burden on a smooth gray rock near the fire and whispered a short thanks before removing the arrow to skin the animal.

The tracker screamed; it had reached his thigh.
 My eyes flicked open.
 The body of the snake made a lump under the skin of the tracker’s leg.
 His face was contorted in agony, but that wasn’t what had done it.
 It was the fear.
 He had cracked.
 Chevelle released the tracker’s hand long enough for the man to scribble a few words of a spell, not allowing him to speak or cast magic.
 He slumped after his surrender, confident the worst was over.
 I reached the sword tip back to his leg and made another incision to release the snake.
 It jerked and coiled free of the wound, flicking blood over the tracker’s pristine white robe.

The club rented a storefront next door to the post office, where they held parties and conspired on plans for retaliation against the gangs from other neighborhoods.
 Everyone in the club was Italian, except one fellow.
 He had a Polish name.
 They all were sharp dressers.
 To them, my traveling wardrobe marked me as a hick and slob.
 So when I arrived in my jeans and flannel shirt at a party to which they hadn’t invited girls yet they still dressed in alligator shoes and polished chino slacks, at least a few of them took offense.
 The Polish fellow began goading me, first about my clothes, then about the beard I had grown, then about what losers were all us from California.
 I attempted patience, since I was their guest and because I remembered Tony’s stories that placed him in the low range of this crowd’s toughness.
 But at last I mouthed a comeback.
 The Polish fellow threw a punch that landed square on my jaw.

More often than before, I noticed hummingbirds, horizons, occotillos.
 Spring was the most glorious in years.
 I was feeling more all the time.
 In 1945, the year I was born, my grandma, Mary Durham Garfield, wrote this poem:
 LIVING MONUMENTS Far rather would I pass away And leave a noble son of mine Whom I had taught to love the fine, The just and honest, in his day To serve the world with courage bold, Than have my life on granite told.
 I’d rather feel when death is near That in my children I shall live.
 No monument of stone can give Me greater glory, year by year, Than sons and daughters going on In truth and honor, when I’m gone.
 Who leaves a noble son on earth, A noble daughter, sweet and pure, Has monuments that long endure.
 No shaft can give her greater worth.
 The luster of her children’s deeds Is all the monument she needs.

"No, the monthly full moon 'kegger' happened last weekend.
 This is just a party to blow off some steam.
 We have them sometimes to celebrate things."
 "Like what?"
 Brandon shook his head as he pulled me back down into my seat.
 "Nope, if you want to find out, you'll have to come to it with me."
 "You know, I don't usually leave conversations midway through.
 You really can let go of me."
 "Maybe, but I'm enjoying holding onto you."
 I forcefully removed his hand as I shook my head.

There were no toll free hotline numbers to call to safely report abuse and we knew better than to tell anyone what was happening behind closed doors.
 If we kept our mouths shut we would hopefully avoid making him even angrier.
 He weighed over 200 pounds and he could do some damage any way he beat us.
 The primary goal when getting beaten by a person nearly twice one’s size is to limit injuries and not escalate the violence because there is no winning.
 I had seen this tactic with my grandfather and my uncle, and my brother and I were now in a similar situation.
 When someone saw the marks or bruises on our bodies we lied so we didn’t get a repeat performance.
 Gym teachers or other kids during showers after PE class asked the most questions.
 We just blamed it on each other as a fight between brothers.
 We just learned to live with it and survive.
 We became quite the fighters at school and other kids learned not to screw with us or we would beat them down.

Chevelle led me to the base of an old willow tree and I slumped against the trunk, sliding down to lie on my back.
 Chevelle reclined against the tree, his legs coming to rest just above my head in the soft grass.
 I gazed through the immense mass of leaves and branches overhead and breathed deeply.
 I felt the need to explain the welt, and my eyes rose toward him as I lightly touched my cheek.
 “I was searching for my mother’s things…” He didn’t respond, staring straight out into the meadow, so I returned to watching the canopy of leaves.
 “I can’t remember her,” I said.
 I hadn’t discussed this with anyone before, but once I started talking, I couldn’t seem to stop.
 Without his response, I kept on, explaining my dreams—purposefully leaving out the part I had read about the northern clans—and closed my eyes in an attempt to see them clearer.
 I was recalling the details, her dark hair blowing in the wind, the feeling of being trapped, when my thoughts faded into the blackness of sleep.
 I woke in my own bed, the room lit by the dim light of a single flame suspended above my table.

Drawing lessons from the Swedish model, introduce a comprehensive programme of education and vocational preparedness for the unemployed, compulsory retraining for those who are unemployed for more than six months, and a strictly managed penalty system for unemployed persons who refuse successive job offers and do not seek retraining.
 7.Improve labour market information and job placement systems: Labour markets are becoming more and more fluid.
 One in ten jobs is now replaced in OECD countries every year.
 This makes the strengthening of job placement systems a crucial element in any full employment strategy.
 Lack of access to information about job or training opportunities retards re-employment.
 Sweden operates one of the most extensive and efficient employment services, in close cooperation with business, that is responsible for filling 60 per cent of total job vacancies.
 Improve labour market information systems within and between countries by increasing the accuracy and comparability of data, requiring mandatory reporting by businesses of all sizes, and freely exchanging information between cities, states and countries on successful employment-generating strategies.
 8.Raise minimum standards for education: Higher education increases productivity, raises personal expectations and consumption, and generates additional jobs in education and elsewhere.
 Lack of qualifications, inadequate and out-dated skills commonly characterize the long-term unemployed.
 There is a strong positive correlation between higher education and higher incomes.

“Try it,” said Dieredon.
 Two more arrows flew, but they halted in mid-air.
 Velixar stood, his hand outstretched, gripping the projectiles with his mind.
 The elf fired two more volleys but all the arrows froze beside the others.
 “Fool,” Velixar hissed.
 At once, the arrows turned and resumed their flight, straight at Dieredon.
 The elf dove, rolling underneath the barrage.
 Not an arrow had hit earth before the elf tucked his feet and kicked.
 The blades sprang from his bow.
 He crossed the distance between the two in a heartbeat.

I woke late in the evening when Ruby switched places with Steed.
 She had brought some meat back with her and we supped together before I headed off to bed.
 Ruby didn’t question why I would be sleeping again so soon.
 She was busy being excited about her upcoming trip.
 I didn’t share her enthusiasm, so I retired to my room and read more of the journal.
 There were many sad passages after the passing of the writer’s mother, though their bond didn’t seem traditional.
 It seemed more… formal.
 And there were many complaints about the additional workload, both with the castle duties—which were described in more detail—and her training.
 I couldn’t be sure how much time had passed without the entries being dated, but her mood had definitely shifted.
 Father has been merciless in my practice and testing with Rune.

Again the short, reluctant nod.
 I had so many questions I still wanted answered, but it didn't seem fair to get Isaac in any more trouble than he was already in.
 "Will you be okay?
 I mean with Alec.
 He's not going to torture you or anything for telling me, is he?"
 Isaac's smile somehow completed his face.
 Funny how I'd never thought there was anything wrong with it before, but after finally being rewarded with something more than his normal, serious countenance, I had the first hint why he was one of Rachel's favorites among the pack.
 "It's likely I'll be exceedingly sore for the next few days, and my ego, such as it is, will likely take quite the beating, but our Kir'shan, our Alpha as you would say, isn't a bad sort."
 That was a relief.
 It also meant I knew exactly what I was going to do when I saw Alec next.

“Go ahead and get cleaned up.
 I’ll be back in a few moments.” I tried to pull myself together as he strode away, but I felt so drained.
 I stood, easing my clothes off, soiled and tattered from the days of batterings.
 The damage on my bare skin was minimal.
 I had imagined much worse as I’d failed to block so many of the strikes.
 I satisfied my ego by giving the cat pee-smelling elixir more credit than was probably due, but some part of me knew the training had not been hard because it was physical.
 It had been the use of magic.
 I put the new shirt on, made of soft black leather and corseted tight around my waist.
 Slim, dark wool pants and tall boots went on next and I wondered at the village we’d be entering where black was appropriate.
 I could think of no one at home who had worn black; I envisioned the dainty blond elves dancing around in dark leather and giggled.

"Have a drink!"
 "Marie!"
 He tried to run away, but she chased him.
 Thoroughly soaked, he changed tactics and ran toward her.
 She screeched and started to run, but he seized her around the waist and grabbed the hose.
 "You're in trouble now."
 He released her and then squirted her.
 Laughing again, Marie twirled in the spray.
 "This is fun!"
 Rick shook his head, grinning.

"Don't worry; I'm sure it's nothing.
 I'll force him to take a couple of days off and I'm sure he'll be fine.
 He's only a bit past middle age for one of us."
 I nearly protested, but Alec was right, it would take an actual order to get Donovan to slow down, and two days was probably pushing it.
 Donovan somehow managed to respectfully circumvent any order he thought prevented him from taking adequate care of Alec's family.
 "Tell me about Christmas at the Paige house."
 I blinked a couple of times.
 The progress I'd made lately notwithstanding, I half expected the question to drive me into a panic attack.
 Apparently Alec's presence was proof against a second near attack today.
 "I don't know.

While I was still struggling to get thoughts to coalesce into words, Alec smoothly went down onto one knee, and picked up my left foot.
 The work of art he slipped onto my foot was so beautiful I felt bad letting it touch the ground.
 I held it up for a second, admiring the way the lights played off its gentle curves while I convinced myself nobody was going to throw me into jail for defiling it by using it for its intended function.
 Glass, or possibly something else perfectly transparent.
 It was hard to tell for sure what it was from so far away, but it wasn't plastic.
 The cool ovals where the sole had been cut away to reveal the material underneath told me that much.
 Whatever it was, it'd been created in layers.
 The outermost material was achingly clear, while the inner layers seemed increasingly less so.
 Alec waited, another smile playing about his lips, while I came to terms with the shoes.
 He then deftly slipped the other shoe onto my right foot, and steadied me as I tried to adjust to suddenly being almost six inches taller.

“Ow,ow,ow, get the heck off me!” I slashed downward and the frost beast let go of my leg.
 It zipped between my legs and launched itself at my left leg.
 I stepped to the side and slammed my foot on the beast’s back.
 It yipped and went still.
 I raced through the crowds, jumping and ducking.
 I looked over my shoulder and up the hill, wishing I could escape all the bodies that were pressed together in combat.
 Then I rammed into one.
 “What the heck?” I fell on my butt and blinked as Jason picked himself off the ground.
 “Sorry,” I said and stood up.
 “Watch where you’re going… Jazell, look out!” Jason suddenly yelled.

“Yesterday… the council trackers…” Trackers?
 I tried to focus on what he was saying and not let my mind run wild with the new information.
 “They will send someone for what I have done.” I thought of the councilman’s face, distorted in pain.
 “We should continue your training.” “Training?” Even I could hear the dread in my question.
 “Practice.
 You should be able to protect yourself.” I remembered his words from before the revelation that ended my magic lessons.
 Fighters.
 A chill ran down my spine as I nodded my assent.
 I’d skinned out of a few run-ins with council and it was no secret how they operated.
 I might be safe enough with Chevelle, but if the others retrieved me… “We will work again at first light and possibly as we ride.” Part of me wanted to argue, As we ride?

We had killed him.
 And they were worried about my stupid binding?
 The circling cloaks from my dreams were back, filling my head.
 My thoughts were twisting, getting out of control.

 They would kill us.
 That was why I needed training.
 To protect myself.
 Because they intended to kill me, not capture.
 They intended to kill us all.

He closed his fist around it and when he opened it a moment later, the stone was floating a half inch above his palm, slick black and shaped to form a tiny hawk sculpture.
 “It’s beautiful,” I said, moving to touch it.
 He held up his other hand up to stop me.
 “Take it.” I wanted to hold the trinket; I reached forward and concentrated on moving it from his palm to mine.
 It floated shakily across the space between us, which seemed so odd at first I thought Chevelle must have moved it.
 I squeezed my fingers around it, as if to verify it was real, but when I opened my hand again it was only the dull gray rock.
 Disappointment filled my face as I looked back at him.
 He tilted his head toward the stone; I would have to make this sculpture myself.
 I closed my fist around it, mostly because I had seen him do the same, and instantly I knew what I wanted to see.
 I opened my palm up, grinning triumphantly, and exposed my creation for Chevelle to see.

They then dragged the body outside to where the deceased elf had kept a private garden.
 Thick brick walls guarded against any prying eyes.
 They dug a large hole in a corner and then bled the body dry, letting the fluids soak into the dirt.
 Occasionally, they would halt and listen, worried their violent struggle had reached unwanted ears.
 No curious investigators arrived, however, and they continued with their dark deed.
 When the blood dripping from the elf’s wounds became but a trickle, they filled the hole and moved on.
 Using the clothes and robes from upstairs, the two brothers wiped away as much of Ahrqur’s blood as they could.
 They tossed the bloody clothes, the table, and the pieces of glass they into the fireplace and burned them.
 Harruq wrapped the body in spare blankets he found in a closet.
 “Grab the sword,” he said as he hoisted the dead elf onto his shoulder.

 You could learn to write movies, and still get home in a couple hours if your mom needs you.
 But you don’t want to go.” “State College is almost free.
 I’m not going to let my mom pay for some expensive place.
 She’d have to keep teaching those screwy eight-graders forever.
 Besides, we were talking about you.” “What about me?” “Weren’t you going to say what you guess the real big change will be?” He brushed the sand off his hands.
 “I don’t know.
 Maybe something great and happy.” He looked up and attempted a grin.
 “Or maybe it’ll be terrible.
 All I know is, it’ll make getting expelled and the rest look like kid stuff.” The next day, Saturday, according to Sylvia, he spent reading Heart of Darkness for the second straight time.

I had thought it was a mistake.
 The images rolled through my mind as we continued up the mountain.
 The lifeless body of a small gray bird.
 A garden of weeds with roots as black as soot.
 The faces of council as their speaker struggled to breathe.
 A thistle growing in Evelyn’s throat, slowly choking off her airway.
 Chevelle’s face when he had asked who had showed me to fuse the crystal with blood.
 His expression as he’d looked down at me the night before.
 How could you not know?
 That image haunted me the most.

"I mean, tea and cucumber sandwiches would be fine."
 At the tearoom her entrance was greeted with cries of disbelief and happiness.
 Everyone was amazed that she looked perfectly healthy and whole, and they were polite and desperately curious when she said she didn't want to talk about what had happened.
 She'd love to know what rumors were going to be flying about, but she knew none would be as fantastic as the truth.
 Several friends invited her to parties and dinners planned for the weekend, but she declined all of them, saying that she wanted to spend some time with her family.
 The truth was that she felt incapable of simply picking up where she'd left off.
 She loved being with her family again, and she was having a wonderful time with her mother, but it felt as if something were missing.
 And she knew Rick was that something.
 As glad as she was to be home, she felt incomplete without him.
 It was as if her whole morning had been a series of peaks and valleys.

The AElf maiden just looked at Rodregas quietly and thoughtfully.
 The Hellborn Orqui smiled, but with a look that said he did it because the other men smiled.
 Rodregas had a feeling that Doi’van lacked much of a sense of humor.
 The other three men simply shook their heads at his idiotic statement.
 Not that his statement did not have a hint of truth to it.
 Rodregas was sure everyone here had lost a loved one, at some point, to an Immortalist.
 But, no Paladin of the Gods had ever come to their rescue.
 The truth was that even if one of the gods was backing Rodregas, it was more likely to be some god who was pissed off at the Immortalists; one looking for a chosen champion for their own selfish reasons.
 As a child Rodregas had dreamed of being such a champion, but Paladin’s were always chosen from the ranks of the Order of the Soaring Heavens, and while Rodregas had once served the Order as a squire he had never came close to achieving knighthood.
 “All right, Sir Paladin, I have to admit I have talked to the Sorcerer Ravenhurr a few too many times, and you definitely don’t seem to be him.

She said it clearly expecting him not to have anything.
 Rodregas did, have a bow.
 He had two very nice bows wrapped up in the wagon.
 But, while the short swords he handed them were dangerous, they were common and easy to replace.
 On the other hand, the Black Yew bows were rare and powerful.
 He also thought about the chain mail that he had found in Ravenhurr’s wardrobe.
 While it was way too small to fit him it would fit Imeralda just fine.
 But to give this woman he barely knew such fine armor and weapons was not something to do casually.
 It made a lot of sense sitting there on the foothills of the Arida Mountains, worrying about Gobelyn and Dire Cat attacks, but they were a great gift; no one had ever given him such a gift.
 “What?” she asked me “You are looking at me like I asked you for your first born child,” she stated in a surprised voice.

By thirteen he had his own band, made up of less-skilled classmates at Snowden Elementary.
 They called themselves Regulation Footwear and soon were playing gigs at high school dances and other social occasions, at Clearpool, even at an end-of-school year rally at the Overton Park Shell, foreshadowing later triumphs.
 Clearly, it was Buddy people came to see, Buddy who garnered them engagements with older audiences.
 Regulation’s drummer, poor Gyp Leach, could barely keep time on his Sears drumset, taking lessons after school at Guitar & Drum City, just progressing past a four-four beat.
 But word was spreading about this precocious guitarist who sounded like a coup de foudre, this scrawny, pimply 8th grader with licks like a junkyard dog.
 Buddy Gardner.
 It was Jim Dickinson who dubbed Buddy “Slipshod,” not because Buddy was a sloppy player but because he put together such sloppy groups around him.
 It mattered not to Buddy who was playing behind him.
 He was lost in the ether, playing for his own private gods, letting the Lydian reverberation carry him away, the sound coming from his own self, you see.
 Oh, of course, he knew when the bassist was faking it, or the drummer tripping over himself to keep up, or the rhythm guitarist playing the same three chords over and over, hoping his stroking would be lost in the thunder.

I could sense some dark black area on the neck just like a target dot.
 I stabbed it and the creature gave a dying hiss, falling to the ground too.
 Seth rubbed his neck and grabbed his sword.
 “Thanks Jazell.” “No problem,” I said.
 “Want to rescue the others?” Seth grinned, “Sure, Jason isn't going to be happy about me saving his butt.” “Well he can deal,” I said and walked quickly towards Emily and Jason.
 “We better hurry.” I reached Emily in a few, quick strides, stabbing some syphons that were trying to attack her.
 She looked up at me and opened her mouth to ask me how the heck I did that but I shook my head.
 I'd explain the unexplainable later.
 “Aim for the neck!” I shouted to the both of them.
 “It's their weak point.” They both nodded in agreement.

If humankind could mobilize and apply the same efficiency to the war on poverty and unemployment that it has exhibited in preparing for and waging military wars against each other, very soon there would be no more poverty or unemployment to fight.
 During the Second World War Ford Motors converted from manufacture of cars for the masses to making trucks and airplanes for the military, producing B-24 bombers at the rate of one per hour from a single production plant.
 If conversion from civilian to military production could be carried out by so many countries within one or two years, it must be possible to convert the military from war-based to peace-based applications, and defence industries from military to civilian production, within half a decade.
 That requires human resourcefulness in organizational innovation.
 Organization is the means by which people work together cooperatively to achieve common goals and, in the process, to serve society in a wide range of functions.
 The achievement of food security and full employment depends on the establishment of new types of public and private organizations – commercial, financial, industrial, export, research, educational and training.
 These institutions are needed to encourage, support, standardize, regulate and control development activities.
 New institutions lie behind the success of most major development achievements.
 India’s Green Revolution was as much a product of new quasi-governmental organizations created for supplying inputs, warehousing and marketing as it was of new farm technology.
 India’s dairy revolution was propelled by the rapid proliferation of producer cooperatives.

While Eric worked, I often helped Cliff and Bill Torrey and their dad rebuild a ’56 Thunderbird.
 Sometimes I visited my cousin Jill at her Pacific Beach apartment.
 Jill was nineteen.
 One Friday evening, she hosted a party.
 I drank several beers, then invited somebody who reminded me of Karen Flagstad to join me for a cruise up the coast road to La Jolla.
 Her name was Kris.
 She would go with me, she said, if not for a babysitting job she had that night.
 After she left, I drank more beer.
 Then I drove to a Jack in the Box on the coast road and found Kris there, in a Ford, hanging onto my cousin Jill’s boyfriend, Jimmy Dixon.
 Jimmy was one tough fellow.

But he is also clearly very honorable.
 And when I asked him why he wanted to be a knight…” she paused then added, “he said that some ‘Infernally damned knights’ have to stand up and fight.” “So you think he is a good man?” Rodregas asked.
 “I think Geriodon is a ‘holier than thou’ stick in the mud, who needs to learn to bathe and not mumble when he speaks.
 And yes, he is probably one of the only men here that actually deserves knighthood.” Rodregas nodded and said, “What about Nordien?” “Nordien is the polar opposite to Geriodon; smooth and friendly… and tried to have sex with me within our first conversation, which was also the only decent thing he said during our conversation.
 He seems to really dislike Geriodon and Karun.
 He comes from a strong blood line and rich family and feels he should already be a knight and not be forced to be in the tournament.” “So, why is Nordien in the tournament and not knighted?” Rodregas asked.
 “From what I can gather, Nordien is very friendly with the Immortalists, including the Ambassador Van’dret, and most people believe that he only wants to be knighted so that he can then leave the knighthood and join the Immortal Guard.” Rodregas nodded.
 That was not too surprising; since such ex-knights are usually made officers.
 Greater sigils were much more rare in the Guard than the knighthood, not to mention the officers of the Immortal Guard lived in much nicer style than the knighthood.
 “The Knight Commander might not be willing to stand up to the Immortalists, but he would be more than willing to skip over giving knighthood to someone who was planning to leave anyhow,” said Rodregas.

Today was no different, which was a good thing since I probably wouldn't have done a very good job of explaining anything.
 Mrs. Campbell shut everything down before my shift started, and sent me home with a concerned look in her eye.
 Rachel skipped over to my table while I was still trying to get my books put away.
 "Guess what.
 I'm bringing pizza on the bus so we'll have something to eat on the way to Les Misérables.
 I can't wait.
 My first time going to Les Misérables, and my first road trip on a bus."
 "You've never actually been on a school bus before, have you?"
 Rachel blushed a little bit.
 "Well, no not really.

Neither logic nor self-interest justify a detached attitude or a half-hearted effort to address this issue.
 As in the case of the recent global response to the threat of global warming from depletion of the ozone layer, it simply is not acceptable for us to remain indifferent or claim that we are powerless to act where the entire world’s vital self-interests are at stake.
 When war threatens a nation’s borders, technology threatens its environment or unemployment threatens the livelihood of its people and the fabric of its social existence, there is only one acceptable response – that is, action.
 The greatest achievement of this century has not been technological, economic or political, but rather the growing concern and intolerance for the slaughter, persecution or impoverishment of other human beings.
 This marks the awakening of our collective, human consciousness to the full value of human life and the consequent rejection of physical strength, political power and money as the governing values of society.
 This evolution of consciousness has led to monumental changes in the accepted rules of social existence.
 Slavery and colonialism were abolished because society evolved to the point where it would no longer tolerate them – not for economic reasons, but because they were a disgraceful blot on the conscience of humanity.
 Similarly, the acceptance of famine, poverty and unemployment as necessary or inevitable by-products of economic life should no longer and need no longer be tolerated.
 Social charity and welfare were necessary inventions to mitigate the worst effects of economic development over the past few centuries, but they are signs of a defective system that humiliate the recipients and deprive them of self-respect, rather than equipping them with the capacity and self-confidence to help themselves.
 As freedom has finally been recognized as an inalienable right of every human being, we are fast approaching the time when society must recognize and ensure the right of every individual to gainful employment.

After reading about a drive from Big Sur into Monterrey, I go online and look up pictures of the two real people (to whom the book gives other names) on that drive, Kerouac and Neal Cassady.
 Both men were remarkably handsome, some of God’s finest art, I think.
 Then I remember a character from Ken Kesey’s Sometimes a Great Notion, and I realize that Kesey may have used Neal Cassady, a fellow of wild intellect and passion, and a legendary womanizer, as a prototype for his character Joe Ben.
 Only he revised, changed his life, and made Joe Ben a real hero.
 Remembering that Kesey and Cassady were friends, I look up some dates.
 Sure enough, they met while Kesey was writing that novel, two years before it came out.
 And no doubt he had read Kerouac's novels featuring Cassady, a.k.a.
 Dean Moriarty et al.
 In Sometimes a Great Notion, Joe Ben used to be, as a teen, so handsome and so enthralled by girls, he never could have stayed true to any one of them.
 But a motorcycle crash disfigured his perfect face.

If the school was paying for the tickets I should just be glad I hadn't been stuck with a standing room only spot.
 Still, as disappointing as it was that the performers were only barely going to be visible, it wasn't as bad as the nagging worry that Rachel wasn't coming after all.
 We'd spent almost every second together talking about how much fun we were going to have seeing Les Misérables together.
 She'd even still been excited about the bus ride.
 Given everything she'd said, I'd anxiously waited for her to show up at the departure point.
 It'd seemed impossible, but as Mrs. Alexander had gently herded me onto the bus, there'd still been no sign of her.
 "Maybe she's driving instead of taking the bus down.
 I seem to remember someone saying her brother had purchased a ticket.
 He isn't here, so possibly they're going down together."
 It'd been a fairly slender thread upon which to hang my hopes.

“Oh.” I decided I’d let them work it out, heading instead to Ruby’s room.
 “I’m going to take a bath.” As I closed the door, Ruby said, “It’s time to tell her.” I didn’t hear a response.
 I was soaking in hot water, my eyes closed, not even considering getting out when she knocked on the door.
 “What, Ruby?” She giggled.
 “How did you know it was me?” No one else is that annoying.
 “Can I come in?” “No.” The water streamed from the tub and out the back window.
 I swore.
 “Fine, I’m getting dressed.” I dried off, gathering clothes from a pile I assumed was for me, too large for Ruby’s petite frame.
 I opened the door and knew right away I would regret whatever they were about to tell me.
 Ruby commanded me to sit.

I didn’t know what to do with myself.
 I had nothing outside of home, outside of the village.
 I didn’t even know where to go, didn’t know where I was.
 It was just another clearing outside of the only town I’d ever known, the only town I remembered knowing.
 I wandered toward the briar patch, finding it easily.
 It hadn’t been far, despite my exhaustion.
 I crawled through the narrow path I’d made the previous time.
 It hadn’t seemed such a tight fit in only pants.
 I settled in, jerking a length of skirt free from the thorns with a spray of colorless beads.
 Brushing the loose dirt off the papers I had buried, I laid the soiled documents across my lap and untied the laces binding them together.

 He hooked them through the air as he repeated his question.
 “Was it willing or not?” he demanded.

The three talked little as they traveled.
 Rodregas set a hard pace and Imeralda sat in the back of the wagon.
 Doi’van weighed too much to ride in the overburdened wagon or to ride the horse, so he jogged next to the wagon.
 He had impressive endurance.
 Right before dark Rodregas was watching carefully and found the faint signs of the rocky trail that he remembered.
 He turned the cart onto it, and after going down the path a bit he came across a good place to camp for the night.
 As Doi’van and Rodregas set up camp, Imeralda went back, doing her best to erase their tracks.
 After dinner they all took turns sleeping and keeping watch.
 Rodregas took the first watch and several times he thought he saw something.
 It was not the men they had left behind, but some animal that never came close.

As we pulled into the parking lot I was desperately looking for something witty or insightful to say.
 I needed to give him a reason to stay interested in me, but nothing came to mind.
 As we pulled to a stop, the quiet hum of a cellphone on vibrate broke the strange paralysis that'd gripped me for the last twenty seconds.
 Brandon's grin was more than a little sheepish as he fished his phone out of a front pocket and checked to see who was calling.
 I didn't need his groan to know it was one of his friends.
 A selfish urge to try and make him ignore the call and continue to focus on me momentarily flared up, but I suppressed it.
 It was such a petty thing to do, and even worse was probably the quickest way to demolish whatever interest he might have towards me.
 I might be almost completely naive when it came to dating, but anyone who'd read more than a couple books, or sat through eight or nine chick flicks, totally knew that the quickest way to drive a guy off was to become controlling and manipulative.
 Unless maybe you were a cheerleader and you were talking about a guy who was used to dating cheerleaders.
 Which while I wasn't even close to the former, the latter actually described Brandon almost perfectly.

“I never want to walk again,” he mumbled.

 She mumbled something and squeezed her sleeves.

I hadn’t done so since the incident and my head spun.
 I wobbled, and Chevelle was suddenly there, steadying me.
 I shook off his look of concern.
 “I’m fine.
 Really.” He shifted closer and I became wholly aware of his hands at my waist.
 The grip he’d used to steady me became softer and yet, at the same time, his fingers tightened around me.
 My breath hitched as he pulled me against him, the length of our bodies touching.
 My throat went dry, black spots swirling in my vision.
 I fought to stay focused on his face, so close.
 His eyes grew troubled and then he blurred out of vision as I went limp in his arms.

Inock killed the first hunter and would have done likewise to the second, but Adjam sprang upon his brother, knocking him away before the second man could be harmed."
 Alec's fingers slowly caressed my stomach as he spoke.
 It should have tickled, but instead it lulled me even further towards oblivion.
 "And thereby the full effect of the Earth's curse was felt.
 Trapped as they were in their beast forms, neither brother could talk to the other, and the resulting confrontation quickly spun out of control.
 Hours later Adjam was left bleeding and broken as his brother disappeared into the night."
 Alec's soothing voice continued on, but I'd lost the ability to listen.
 My mind floated off into visions of a battered wolf who dragged himself over to a brook before collapsing on the bank, streaked with mud.
 Just before the blackness carried me completely away, a willowy girl appeared from behind a thicket of trees and timidly approached the bleeding figure.
 Chapter 30 The cool night air dimpled my skin despite the warmth of Alec's chest.

_Maybe Harruq more than Qurrah._
 The day passed, and it was thankfully uneventful.
 She was almost ready to leave when Qurrah pulled Harruq closer and began whispering.
 Aurelia cast a spell over her ears, heightening her already sharp hearing.
 A pall settled over her as she listened.
 “…‌must resume,” Qurrah was saying as her spell enacted.
 “It’s dangerous,” Harruq said.
 “I thought you were learning enough from Velixar.”
 “Exactly,” said Qurrah.
 “But I must practice what I learn.

 "Do you think we have everything we need?"
 "Yes.

When Richard wasn’t plunking on it, weaving garrulous runs around the melodies of old standards, he gawked at TV horror movies.
 Eric, Sylvia, and I discussed religion and books.
 She attended no church but disdained atheists.
 Lord of the Flies she called propaganda by which teachers could argue the superiority of adults.
 Catcher in the Rye she applauded because Holden Caulfield appreciated jazz and was nearly as cynical as herself.
 She dismissed Nietzsche as a syphilitic blowhard.
 While we gabbed, Richard might eye us as though he had something to say.
 But the moment would pass, and he would turn back to gawk at the tube until Sylvia ordered him to fetch her cigarettes, or made him stand still while she straightened his tie, or checked to see that he had zipped all the way.
 Observing them made us recommit ourselves to becoming supermen.
 One Friday night, I arrived just as they were leaving for a jazz club.

The elf grabbed the shaft of the arrow, and that sick anger filled his face.
 “How many of my kin died to your hand?” he asked.
 A twist of his hand sent spasms of pain all throughout Qurrah’s body.
 He coughed violently, and blood ran down his lips and neck.
 “Don’t feel like answering?” the elf mocked.
 “Why did you kill them?
 For money?
 Power?
 How many died to better your miserable excuse of a life?”
 Another twist.

“Yes,” he exalted.
 He raised his arms above his head to construct a massive circle of blazing heat.
 When his eyes returned to mine, he smiled.
 He liked playing with fire.
 And then he shoved the fireball toward me with frightening speed.
 I threw both hands in front of me, palms out, and forced the largest mass I could in response.
 Chevelle flicked his wrist and the flame dodged up and angled back toward me.
 I shook my hands frantically, spitting sharp bullets of heat at it, hoping to break it up.
 But he pulled his hands apart and the thing split, each side curving toward me; there were two now, closing in fast.
 I leapt forward just as they collided where I’d been standing and lost my footing while I watched the fireworks behind me.

He easily cradled me in one arm, while carefully picking up my painting with his free hand.
 A short time later, we were back inside the house and headed towards his room.
 Cuddled up against his chest with the familiar, warm tingle caressing my skin, my system apparently decided I was completely safe, and started shutting down.
 I was doing a fairly respectable job of hiding my drooping eyelids, but all my efforts were undone by the prodigious yawn that ambushed me as he set me down on the bed.
 "I'm not tired, I promise."
 His eyebrow arched in disbelief as I pulled him down onto the bed, and I found myself admitting the truth.
 "Okay, I might be a little tired, but it isn't a big deal.
 I want to spend as much time with you as possible.
 After all, it isn't like I'm going to be able to really get much rest between now and whenever we need to leave for the challenge."
 His wonderfully expressive face froze into the stony mask he wore so often with the rest of the world.

Employment is not a zero sum game.
 Computerization: The exciting growth of ICT-based service exports by no means exhausts the potential contribution of computers to growth of employment opportunities.
 Computerization is not merely a field or sector of commercial activity.
 The computer is an instrument and a catalyst that can stimulate creation of employment and self-employment opportunities in virtually every field – from farming, fishing and textile designing to lean manufacturing, financial services, bio-informatics and genetic engineering.
 While the application of computers has already been extended to all these fields, there has not yet been a systematic effort to assess the employment potential that can be tapped by fully extending and accelerating this movement.
 The recent initiative in India to establish knowledge centres in every Indian village by 2007 is one example of a pioneering effort to harness ICT as a means to catalyze a whole range of on-farm and off-farm rural activities, which will inevitably translate into more and higher productivity and greater employment generation.
 These centres can be utilized to deliver technological expertise to upgrade farm yields, vocational training and education, purchasing and marketing information to raise incomes.
 The experience of India also shows that bridging the digital divide helps to bridge the gender divide in the area of knowledge and skill-intensive work.
 As the construction of rural roads acts as a stimulus to agricultural development of isolated communities by connecting them with sources of inputs and markets in the outer world, ICT can be a catalyst for stimulating the entire gamut of economic activities in rural communities throughout the developing world.
 At the other end of the spectrum, ICT is opening up unparalleled opportunities for self-employment and new business creation for the educated.

For my part, I hope to have the continued pleasure of your company for a very long time."
 I felt myself blushing.
 I hated how easily my face heated up, but a little thing like my imminent death was hardly going to change that.
 "Thanks, Donovan.
 Not just for that either.
 I haven't properly thanked you for how nice you've been to me."
 Donovan waved away my thanks.
 "That is no more or less than my duty to a member of the family, and with that, we've arrived."
 The Graves estate was cradled between two spurs, and we'd finally traversed the length of the estate to arrive where the spurs joined the mountain.

“Will you kill me, too?”
 “I asked you not to fight, but here you are.
 Qurrah made it simple, Aurry.
 Either I love you or I kill you.”
 Sparks rained down as he clanged his swords together.
 “Is that how you feel?” she asked.
 The tears in her eyes ran down her cheeks, not to be replaced by any more.
 “So be it.” She took up her staff and held it defensively.
 “You are a fool, Harruq.
 May you die as one.”

"No."
 He turned the key, put the car in reverse, and backed out of the garage.
 She gave him directions, trying not to notice how different all the houses in the neighborhood looked.
 "There--over there!

 She jumped out before he could stop completely and ran up to the front door.
 Rick dashed after her, grabbing her arm before she could open the door.
 "We'd better knock."
 "But this is my house."

I wondered if I could figure out a way to locate them without seeing where they were first.
 I thought of the wolves.
 If I had an animal trained, I could call it to me to use at my leisure.
 I had no idea where they were now.
 Besides, the thought of entering those massive, vicious-looking animals made me uneasy.
 Maybe I could get in on the hunt tonight, find something away from the clatter of rocks under horse hooves.
 At the lack of options, I closed my eyes again to fall into Steed’s horse.
 It felt similar to my own, though I could tell he had more power, more confidence.
 I pulled back and experimented with each of the other horses.
 Anvil’s seemed slower, fatigued.

 While driving I’m inclined to find fault with others who have the gall to use the same road I do at the same time.
 Especially if they are these fellows who have surrouned me on I-5 north of Vancouver, Washington.
 In the rain, with their semis, they spray torrents at my windshield.
 But recalling that yesterday I got blessed for choosing not to judge, I begin to practice understanding these truck drivers’ concern for time and distance.
 Soon I notice that when I go into critical mode, my awareness of the proximity to God shuts down.
 Praise, love, adore, perhaps even admire or commiserate with someone, God joins in.
 Condemn, I’m on my own.
 So, I have found a new rule to live by: the more I criticize or judge, the less the Holy Spirit cares to hang with me.
 Who could blame her?

"I was in bed too--and desperately needed to get out.

 Rick shook his head.
 Dirk, at 28 three years younger than Rick, was as leery of marriage as Rick, but for different reasons.
 He liked having a variety of women to choose from, frequently juggled more than one relationship--if you could call them that--at once, and sometimes seemed to enjoy getting caught at it so that he could put his charm to a real test.
 "I ran into Kim the other day."
 Dirk hit the ball.
 "Kim who?"
 Rick had to run to get it.

In each area, a study should be conducted of resources and economic potentials, existing institutions and infrastructure, current levels of skill and social attitudes regarding the market system.
 Detailed strategies should be devised to educate the public about untapped opportunities, strengthen the institutional infrastructure, impart needed skills, establish catalytic demonstrations and encourage multiplication of successful new activities.
 A plan should be adopted at the forthcoming UN Social Summit for establishing model district programmes in Eastern and Central European countries.
 Plans for transition should cover all of the factors listed above, providing trained personnel to assist in the establishment and initial operation of new institutions and systems.
 7.Plan for institutional development: An assessment of the type and functioning of existing institutions and economic systems should be compiled to identify missing links that need to be provided to support the transition.
 Based on this study, a master plan should be drawn up for establishing the necessary institutions and systems in each country.
 In order to prepare a cadre of managers for private sector industry and institutions, specialized institutes of management should be set up in each country.
 8.Launch a massive programme to impart new skills and attitudes to the population: In countries where private enterprise was extinguished for decades, entrepreneurial, financial and marketing skills can be extremely limited.
 An analysis should be undertaken of the types and levels of skills needed for transition to a market system, covering areas such as entrepreneurship, management, national and international marketing, strategic business planning, finance, quality control, product development, production technology, design, and human resource development.
 Experience in former colonial nations where entrepreneur ship was also stifled for a long period indicates that a profound change in attitude is necessary before people will risk leaving or forego seeking salaried and pensioned jobs in favour of self-employment, even when the salaried jobs are scarce or unavailable.

Steed stood still, focused on the spot where Grey had landed and was flickering in and out of view.
 I made an effort to consider possible responses in my head, but was coming up blank.
 The nerves were gone.
 I found myself wanting Steed to win and leaned with his strikes, tensing as if they were my own.
 Grey bounded through the air once more, showing off, confident in his evident lead, and then a small rock rose at chest height in front of Steed.
 I was trying to figure out who had lifted it when Grey flashed back into view, hesitating only a moment as he considered the rock.
 At once, his face changed; he knew he’d been beaten.
 As he’d paused to study the floating rock, Steed had immobilized him and, just like that, the match was over.
 Ruby leaned into me, voice soft.
 “Steed is stronger than Grey.

Kill if needed.

 Ahrqur nodded, his eyes seething.
 Velixar reached out and placed his hand on the elf’s forehead.
 Qurrah watched as smoke rose from their contact, yet neither flinched.
 When the necromancer drew back his hand, a strange symbol lay overtop the faint scarring of the slanted Y.
 It was of a fallen man wreathed in flame.
 “When you fall, the enchantment upon your forehead shall burn your body to ash.

 So, to try and instill in it some of the eternal verities, well, it seems pretentious.
 But it also seems meet and right that one should try.

 I mean, I’d never question his authority.
 But, we still try, right?
 He still tries, God bless him.

He scowled at the chicken as he took it from the oven.
 How was he going to help her get back?
 He didn't have much faith-- Marie's scream almost made him drop the chicken.
 Depositing the pan on the stove, he ran to the living room.
 She was sitting up, gasping for breath, a look of terror on her face.
 "What's wrong?"
 he asked, hovering over her.
 "I want to go home!
 I don't belong here--I want to go home!"
 Her heart was beating wildly, and she was having a hard time catching her breath.

The tears finally made their escape as I crumpled back onto the bed.

 Guilting him into helping me more just felt wrong.

Rodregas met Doi’van’s smile with a smile of his own.
 He reached out and grabbed Doi’van’s forearm and gripped it in the handshake of warriors and said, “You have spoken to me honestly.
 I will honor that with my own honesty.
 I don’t know exactly how I ended up in this body, but I do know that I killed Ravenhurr, and I killed his bastard assistant, Korin.
 The Immortalists are a sore on the world.
 Their use of others’ bodies and power and their very way of life is abhorrent.” Rodregas looked Doi’van in the eyes and said, “The name I was born with is Rodregas.
 When I decided to kill Ravenhurr, I promised the gods that if they let me survive, I would take on the duty of killing the Immortalists.
 It is a duty that I know will end in my death.
 There are hundreds of Immortalists.
 Some almost as powerful as gods, but it is a good death and one I have chosen.” Rodregas paused and looked at Doi’van’s features.

 She took her toothbrush and put toothpaste on it.
 "I understand.
 But that doesn't make it any easier."
 Tossing his washcloth into the clothes basket, he picked up a brush, and when she straightened after having brushed her teeth, he began smoothing her hair with long, slow strokes.
 Marie closed her eyes, tears seeping from them.
 She stood still for as long as she could, but finally, unable to bear the tenderness of his touch, she turned around and took the brush from him.

As the construction of rural roads acts as a stimulus to agricultural development of isolated communities by connecting them with sources of inputs and markets in the outer world, ICT can be a catalyst for stimulating the entire gamut of economic activities in rural communities throughout the developing world.
 At the other end of the spectrum, ICT is opening up unparalleled opportunities for self-employment and new business creation for the educated.
 Today more than 50 per cent of American workers utilize computers in their work.
 The growth of the World Wide Web has given rise to on-line global markets in which individuals can bid for a broad range of projects involving activities such as research, translation, technical writing, proofreading, desktop publishing, and business consulting.
 A new publication identifies a few hundred self-employment opportunities of this kind.
 The future of work will offer increasing opportunities for people throughout the world to match their specialized knowledge and skills with specialized employment opportunities wherever they may originate.
 Meeting the Skill Shortage: Perhaps the single greatest opportunity for employment growth lies in addressing the growing mismatch between the skills of job seekers and the skills required for expanding economies.
 In both industrial and developing countries, workers may be in surplus, but the skills needed are in deficit.
 In the most prosperous nations, the deficit is concentrated in high technology and professional sectors, in electronics, biotechnology, health care, pharmacology, mathematics, marketing, financial services, and the like.
 The adoption of new technologies even in traditional occupations has resulted in a growing demand for higher skill levels in these fields as well.

I dropped my face into my hands, and might have wept if I’d not been so fueled by fear and adrenaline.
 “Freya?” a soft voice asked.
 I looked up, startled.
 Chevelle stood just in front of me.
 He dropped to his knees and reached out to touch the mark across my cheek.
 Shame flooded me, and I turned my head to hide the evidence, but his hand cradled the side of my face.

 “Freya,” he repeated in a softer voice as he lifted my chin.
 He appeared to have real concern as he glanced from what I was sure was now a welt to my eyes, and I struggled to keep the tears that were welling up from falling.
 I’d not had a caring touch from anyone for so long I didn’t know how to react.

In recent years, unemployment has emerged as a major cause of concern for governments around the world.
 In industrial countries, the subject evokes pessimistic prophecies of a fast-approaching future in which tens of millions of people will never find jobs, technology eliminates the need for human labour, cheap imports replace domestic jobs, welfare systems collapse under an unbearable burden, children have less economic opportunity than their parents, a widening abyss divides the rich and poor, and both markets and governments are powerless to do anything about it.
 In developing countries, it dashes hopes of ever conquering hunger, eradicating wide spread rural and urban poverty, and bridging the gap that separates these nations from the prosperous West.
 The very same deterministic mentality that until recently made us feel that a nuclear war was inevitable now leads many to conclude that rising unemployment, chronic poverty and social alienation are unavoidable.
 Yet the enormous gains of peace and democracy that we contemplate cannot be secured and brought to fruition if this other apprehension is allowed to become a settled reality, as war between nations has been during past millennia.
 The peace and security we seek internationally depend directly on our ability to promote and maintain domestic peace and tranquillity within nations, which in turn are dependent on the ability of countries to provide food and economic security to their people.
 Poverty and unemployment are closely linked to most instances of social unrest – tribal wars, civil wars, urban crime, drugs and violence.
 There is clear evidence from the US and UK that crime is economically related to lack of job opportunities.
 Unemployment is also a major cause of massive migrations, both to urban areas within countries and across borders, which has become a highly destabilizing factor in many regions.
 Without sufficient purchasing power for food and other material essentials and non-essentials, there can be no assurances of lasting social peace and political stability.

Bob’s out front, as usual, but, I think the movement is going to be toward simpler things.
 I mean, we’ve been there, right?
 We’ve been to Strawberry Fields.
 We’ve seen the Walrus.
 I’ve got a new song—you haven’t heard it, yet—it’s called, uh, “Bookstore Blues”—
 LE: 	“Burke’s Book Store Blues.”
 BG:  	Right.
 Anyway, it’s just me and Lor.

We both stopped shivering as we stared at the sky.
 “Seth, I’m scared,” I whispered.
 “What happens if something goes wrong?” “Nothing will go wrong,” he said fiercely.
 “I won’t let it happen.” I closed my eyes.
 “I keep seeing what happened that night.” “It’ll go away,” he said.
 There was a long silence.
 “This is too awkward and I don’t like the silence.
 It’s not normal for us.” I laughed.
 “Someone make a joke quick!” “Okay,” he said.
 “This feels like those weird movies where the boy puts his arm around the girl and then something comes out of nowhere and eats them both.” I laughed so hard I gagged.

Globally, 7 to 9 million workers were employed in automotive manufacturing in 1980 and perhaps as many as 50 to 80 million in related occupations.
 In addition, the spread of automotive technology has had tremendous impact on the growth of other industries stimulated by the greater mobility of the public – retail trade, hotels, restaurants, tourism, recreation – and indirectly on agriculture, as well as every other service and manufacturing industry that benefits from lower cost and greater speed of passenger and freight transport.
 Advances in technology provide society with greater conveniences and in the process endow the society with greater creative and productive abilities.
 Over time, these new abilities spur the creation of new activities in many different fields distantly related to the original point of innovation.
 The process results in improvements in health, which raise the level of physical energy; higher standards of education, which raise the level of mental energy and culture; and higher levels of social skills and organization, which raise the energy level of the entire society, making it ever more creative and productive.
 A comprehensive study of this wider process of job creation and destruction arising from technological innovation is needed to develop specific coefficients for measuring the impact of technological advances in different fields on total employment.
 Eventually, we may hope to dispel the widespread fear and sense of helplessness that this issue evokes.
 The notion that there are a fixed or inherently limited number of jobs that can be created by the economy is a fiction.
 It is not just advances in technology that work in this fashion.
 Every major advance in social attitudes, institutions, values and lifestyles has a dual effect on employment, creating jobs in some areas and destroying them in others.

My wandering path brought me around to where I could see what I'd mentally dubbed 'Alec's corner'.
 It was a good thing there was an empty chair nearby.
 The force of Jasmin's stare was almost a palpable thing; my knees got weak so quickly it was like she'd reached out and pushed me.
 I steadied myself and then tried to ignore the way my skin crawled as I crossed the rest of the distance to Brandon's table.
 "The mongrels unnerve you a bit?"
 The scorn on the face that the comment belonged to was unnerving.
 I'd seen him several times before, but didn't have a name to go with his aristocratic features.
 "That's enough, Vincent."
 A trace of rebelliousness flared up at Brandon's chastisement, but Vincent buried it so quickly I almost didn't have enough time to classify it before it disappeared.
 Interestingly enough, I could see Cassie out of the corner of my eye, and she didn't look any happier than Vincent.

That I couldn’t leave.
 “You’ll need to learn protection spells.” “I… I can’t…” “We won’t tell Francine or the Council,” he promised, and I didn’t miss that he’d used Fannie’s real name.
 Then, softer, “We won’t even tell Junnie.” I didn’t understand.
 The cold, wet ground seeped through the material covering my legs, and I shifted, fidgeting as I looked up at him.
 “I mean I can’t do magic, just useless stuff… lighting candles…” “Then we start with fire,” he said.
 Chevelle lowered his hand to mine and stood, pulling me up and toward the center of the clearing.
 When we’d distanced ourselves from the tree line, he stopped and turned back to me, still holding my right hand.
 My eyes followed his as he looked down at our clasped hands and a cool blue flame lit on my right sleeve.
 Immediately, my free hand jerked up to extinguish it.
 Chevelle took it to keep me from smacking at the flame, which had already disappeared.

"They were pretty close.
 There weren't that many of them, but they could've decided to push the issue regardless."
 I spent the rest of the trip, expecting someone to jump out of the trees, but faster than I'd have believed possible, the wrought iron gates I'd noticed on our trip out last night were swinging open, and we were turning off onto Alec's asphalt lane.
 A distinguished-looking gentleman in his fifties was waiting for us as we screeched to a stop.
 His slightly disapproving frown hinted at decades of practice letting his 'bosses' know when they'd just crossed some kind of line, all the while never crossing any himself.
 The shape shifters all exited the car, most before it had even stopped moving, and then Jessica and Dominic both appeared as I made my comparatively slow way out of the vehicle.
 "...everyone's okay.
 I was somewhat worried about taking so much of our strength away.
 I'm glad it worked out."
 Alec turned towards the older man as I made my hesitant way over to the group.

When my head nicked the board, the day went black.
 I don’t remember falling.
 Probably the water revived me.
 As Eric helped me out, I got more cheers than he had.
 Later he would explain I had made a neat flip while careening into the pool.
 He led me inside, wetted a washcloth and dabbed the wound on my forehead until I faded.
 I awoke on the outskirts of heaven, gazing across a chasm at the enchanted forest.
 The air resonated with music, clean and simple melodies, at once ardent, tender and joyful.
 Maybe it was a dream.
 Or a premonition.

So I tracked him down and called him.
 Richard was living in Arkansas and had been for many years.
 We talked on the phone and upon discovering he would be near our homes on a business trip, arranged a meeting at a hotel—with Thomas too.
 Thomas begged out at the last minute, and without contacting Richard I brought my friend Bill with me for the drive into the bay area.
 When I knocked on the door of the hotel room, my father opened the door looked at me, called me Thomas, and then he looked at Bill and called him by my name.
 He didn’t even know what his own kids looked like.
 We spent a brief time in the hotel room getting our names and heritage correct then we were off to dinner.
 During the dinner, Richard asked if I could “score some toot” which I discovered meant find cocaine.
 Well, I didn’t need to look much past my pocket to score, so we ended up getting drunk and snorting toot to commemorate our father and son reunion.
 At the time, it seemed like, “Wow, my dad is cool,” but I later realized how sick it all truly was.

Or lunch.
 She had no idea what time it was.
 She went to brush her teeth and take a shower.
 She decided the shower could wait until after breakfast, though, when her stomach began rumbling.
 She hoped Rick was making pancakes too.
 He was in the hall when she opened the door.
 “Morning.” She smiled up at him sleepily.
 “Good morning.” She was wearing only his pajama top and looked unbelievably sexy.
 Drawing her close, he bent his head and kissed her.
 Marie sighed with pleasure as she returned Rick’s kiss.

This was good, for he didn’t want to.
 Too much was on his mind for argument.
 He remained quiet and listened.
 “He wants to change you, turn you into what you know he is.

 Without conscience.
 A living weapon to be used however he wants you to be used.”
 Harruq’s heart sped up a few paces as Aurelia rose and walked over to where he sat.
 She knelt down and rubbed a soft hand against his face.
 She finally looked into his eyes.

Marie decided she’d ask Grace to make her a waffle this morning.
 She’d like cherries and whipped cream on it.
 She’d go shopping with her mother and maybe have lunch in town.
 After lunch she’d come home to take a nap.
 The house would be hot in the afternoon.
 “Don’t forget to pick up the dry cleaning!” Marie jumped, looking up to see who’d yelled.
 A car door slammed, and she saw a sleek gray car back out of a driveway.
 She’d wandered far from Rick’s house .

 It happened several years ago.
 Karen –I didn’t mean to drudge up old pain.

 Karen – How could have it gotten worse than that?
 Art – She could have told me that I was evil incarnate and that I turned her into a lesbian.
 I don’t know how long it would have taken to have gotten over that.

"A field trip sounds great.
 Except I have to be back at least three hours before the dance, or Rachel and Jasmin will eat me.
 At least that's what they said, and I tend to believe them."
 Alec crossed over to me and ran a finger down the side of my face.
 "Only you could manage to make a joke out of having fallen in with monsters."
 I shrugged.
 "What else is a girl to do?"
 Alec's reply shrug mirrored mine exactly and yet still turned the movement into something far more graceful and eloquent than what I'd managed.
 "Be that as it may, I think you don't give yourself enough credit for just how amazing you are."
 I felt myself start to blush as Alec disappeared into the bathroom.

Give us half an hour, and then ask Donovan to show you the way."
 I felt my face break into a huge smile, but he held a hand up to forestall my thanks.
 "This is all still very much against my better judgment, but I'm finding it increasingly hard to refuse you the things you want the most."
 "Somehow I find that hard to believe.
 Even if it were true, you're hardly the type to give away the upper hand by coming out and telling me so."
 Alec's eyes had taken on the serious, resigned expression that'd become disturbingly commonplace lately.
 "I know.
 I think that last part bothers me the most, but I find myself doing so nevertheless.
 Make sure you wait at least half an hour.
 There's a definite element of danger to all of this."

If he was my watcher, I’d be his responsibility, and she was the only one who knew me at all aside from Fannie.
 He was a good fifty yards farther as I considered.
 My feet were moving before I’d actually decided to follow him.
 My determination faltered.
 How far should I go?
 What if he wasn’t going to find Junnie?
 And then I thought, What else do you have to do, sit here and blow up frogs?
 It was all the convincing I needed.
 Slinking out from the branches of the spruce, I crept low along the trees and brush as I followed my watcher north.

For a moment it looked like Brandon was going to let Vincent knock the teacher into a wall, but then he gestured Vincent back.
 Brandon's pack relaxed slightly, and then, presumably acting on a signal from Alec that I couldn't see, Dominic and Jasmin fell back to help Jess and I.
 Even with Dominic under my right arm, I couldn't hop along without jostling my ankle, and I felt tears gathering in the corners of my eyes again.
 Alec carefully lifted me into his arms before I took more than two or three hops.
 Jasmin had her cell phone out before she'd even made it to the stairs, and the sound of a massive engine under hard acceleration heralded the arrival of our limo.
 I leaned back in my seat as everyone else settled into their spots.
 Alec pulled out his pocket square and used it to dab away my tears.
 "I'm sorry.
 I didn't mean to set you down so hard."
 Jasmin interrupted before I could say anything.

He fell sideways, ricocheted off the rail and landed on asphalt.
 Scraped and bruised all over, he went home with Carol, who lived nearby.
 Her parents were gone.
 Whatever they did that afternoon, Eric wouldn’t say.
 But something went wrong, and it sent him into a funk so deep, he gave up the job and asked did I want to go camping up the coast.
 We borrowed surfboards, drove to San Onofre, and pitched a tent on the cliffs.
 Between our assaults on the surf, I told Eric stories about my exploits in Pacific Beach.
 Though he chuckled about my status as top dog, he said, “I hope you know that’s not what being Superman’s about?” “Aw, give me a little credit, will you?” I snapped, annoyed that he had seen through me.
 I got more than friendly with Gloria Valenciana, who was down from Los Angeles camping with her family.
 Her dad made her turn in early.

You’re breaking your own rules.
 Why were you out?” Emily can be very demanding sometimes, I actually felt a little bad about involving her in my interrogation.
 Just a little.
 He mumbled something under his breath.
 “I can’t hear you.” Emily snapped.
 “I WAS OUT SCOUTING!” he shouted, “Now can you hear me?” “Yes, and now you’ve made me deaf!” Emily yelled back.
 “Why were you out scouting in the first place?” I asked calmly, trying not to shout it out like Emily.
 Seth gripped the handlebars and I knew he was losing his temper.
 “I was being cautious so we didn’t have to worry last night,” He said through gritted teeth.
 He was lying and both of us knew that.

I suddenly had a hard time breathing.
 The idea of lying alone in the dark, in the very room I'd just seen Brandon demolish, sent my heart into an erratic rhythm.
 If there'd been an EMT present they'd have already been charging up the defibrillator.
 Alec turned around while I was still trying to get my throat to work again.
 "You stopped breathing.
 What's wrong?"
 The tears his touch had dried up a few seconds before were back, and just seconds away from escaping the corners of my eyes by the time I finally pulled myself up onto my knees and managed to speak.
 "Please don't send me there.
 Not after my dream."
 There was just enough moonlight trickling into the room for me to see his expression change.

 I despise the day that Arthur asked me to marry him.
 I despise myself for ever happily agreeing.
 Obviously I was blinded to the truth, but now I it, as my father had always insisted.
 My biggest failure in life was not having listened to his wise words.
 But I have paid for the arrogance of ignoring his wisdom with my very youth.
 You’re all going to hell.
 I won’t bother praying for you because it wouldn’t help.
 Now I need to spend the rest of my life scouring my soul clean of the taint that you have put on it.

Painful too, he noticed as he took a few steps.
 Furious, he turned back to the corpse of the drunken man and smashed a fist against its chest.
 The body shriveled into dust, only the bones remaining.
 “Halt!” shouted a voice from far down the street.
 Qurrah glimpsed an elf carrying a bow.
 Just one, the half-orc noticed, but that would quickly change.
 “Perhaps you’ll have some use after all,” Qurrah said to the bones.
 He whispered words of magic as the elf took a few steps closer and notched an arrow.
 A purple fire surrounded the bones, pulled them into the air, and then hurled them in a giant wave.
 The elf released his own arrow, but Qurrah was faster.

 "Unacceptable.

 Harruq relaxed and enjoyed the heat while his brother tightened his robe and leaned toward the fire.
 “Things are more dangerous now, aren’t they?” Harruq asked after a pause.
 Qurrah nodded, his thoughts distant.
 “They’re ready for us.
 Many elves will be lurking inside the woods as they hunt for the Forest Butcher.” Again Qurrah chuckled at the name his brother had earned.

 “So, how old are you?” “Twenty-two,” he said, almost shamefacedly.
 At first, I was shocked at the number; I thought maybe I’d misunderstood.
 But I remembered reading the human lifespan was very brief.
 I’d have guessed ten times that number if he were an elf.
 “Why the hint of embarrassment?” “They tell me I should have a family by now.” “You have none?” “A mother and father but none of my own.
 No wife, no children.” “You are expected to have a wife and child after just two decades of life?” He laughed for some reason I could not see.
 “Then you have no family of your own?” “I am not expected to pair for quite some time, if ever.
 And children?
 Ha!” He was visibly perplexed so I kept talking.

My last summer in Chico, I was sorely depressed, living too far from my family and confused about most everything.
 And I discovered the best I could do to relieve depression was turn my thoughts and concerns from myself to others.
 Even the feeling like a rock in my belly went away.
 Love heals.
 Along with The Practice of the Presence of God and some mysteries, I have been reading about Feodor Dostoyevski's philosophical positions, because the issues he tackled a century and a half ago are still remarkably current.
 In Dostoyevski the Thinker, I discovered a passage written following the death of his first wife.
 Since I have the book with me, I pull into a turnout overlooking the Pacific, find the passage and reread it.
 "To love someone as oneself, in accordance with Christ's commandment, is impossible.
 The love of personality is binding on earth.
 The self stands in the way.

Already there are growing signs of impatience, disappointment and frustration arising from the greater hardships that have come in place of the greater benefits that all expected.
 It is essential that these energies be channelled into constructive pursuits that generate tangible improvements.
 Otherwise they may recoil from the effort and look backwards to a failed system or be guided by false prophets on a path that once again poses a threat to other nations.
 The phenomenon of growing violence in an age of increasing affluence seems to contradict the thesis that poverty is one of the major causes of violence, until we realize that the increasingly visible signs of prosperity the world over raise the expectations and aggravate the sense of deprivation and revolt among those that have been by-passed by the general progress.
 Greater political and social freedom can only further magnify this tendency.
 This suggests that violence at the international, national and community levels cannot and will not be eradicated before poverty itself has been abolished, and that, if poverty is left unaddressed at its source, further economic progress is likely further to aggravate conflict in society, unless we are able to extend the benefits of progress to everyone.
 This realization would be quite disconcerting were it not for the fact that we are fast approaching the time when both these persistent ills of humankind can be banished forever – the way slavery and colonialism were banished in the past.
 The recognition that it is neither desirable nor possible to go backwards adds urgency to our efforts to move forward.
 Revolutions of the past have been partial and localized negative reactions against an existing social order, and benefited only a small part of society that, in turn, blindly resisted change.
 They resulted in war and usually much destruction.

By the same equation, the more we love ourselves, the more inclined to evil we are, while the more we love God and others, the more we may achieve good.
 As I pull back onto Highway 101, I concluded the greatest evil must be done by those totally in the grip of self-love, and the greatest good by those closest to the annihilation of self.
 I can't find any flaws in that equation, except as regards finding the way along the path away from self-love.
 Dostoyevski maintained our nature compels us to strive toward the love of God and others.
 But preachers often argue that striving does us no good whatever, that in order to grow toward love we need to surrender our selves to God and ask him to lead us.
 Some preachers would contend we can count on God's direct leading, through prayer and messages we will receive if we listen.
 Others would tell us to rely on God indirectly, by reading and following the example of Christ and the principles he gave.
 In the Sermon on the Mount alone, Christ urges us to keep our desires in check, speak the truth, give sacrificially, set aside worries, pray, withhold judgment except about our own thoughts and actions, and ask for good gifts such as wisdom.
 Mostly to slow my whirling mind, I speak a prayer, a request I have often made, asking God to help me love better.
 And what comes is a reminder of something I've been told more than once.

6.A cooperative collective security frame work must be evolved that is inclusive of all nations and guarantees their security against acts of external aggression.
 A standing international military force or World Army should be established under a democratic framework to provide unconditional security guarantees to member countries against aggression by other nations.
 If such a force cannot be established at the present time under the UN, then there is need for a separate organization similar in constitution to NATO but open to all nations that practise democratic principles of national governance, contribute financial and defence resources to a common armed force, accept ceilings on national defence expenditure and eschew the possession of nuclear weapons.
 The army should consist of both a directly recruited standing force and forces placed on call by member nations.
 7.The use of nuclear weapons should be declared by the UN a crime against humanity.
 First use by any nation must automatically invoke the strongest collective security measures by the UN Security Council.
 Based on the precedent of the Chemical Weapons Treaty, the proposal for a universal ban on the possession of nuclear weapons by any nation should be placed before the Security Council for a vote.
 The five permanent members should agree to the suspension of their veto power on this issue so crucial to the future of humanity.
 8.The danger to all nations of unexpected and unprovoked attack from near or distant powers can be vastly reduced by declaring an immediate ban on the use of ballistic missiles of all types, including those carrying conventional war heads.
 This would eliminate the discriminatory provisions that deny missile acquisition to some while preserving the right of others to maintain and develop this purely offensive capability.

 I glanced around and realized everyone had been listening.

Recognition of opportunities releases fresh energy and constructive initiative.
 Setting goals to achieve minimum needs ensures that the minimum is the most we will accomplish.
 Seeking to tap the maximum potentials challenges us to strive unceasingly for higher goals.
 The world possesses the technology, resources and organizational abilities needed to eradicate poverty from the globe.
 Positing material constraints becomes a justification for non-action.
 The true constraints are not material, but psychological and social.
 Recognizing the real barriers will help us overcome them.
 Human beings are our most creative, productive and precious resource.
 Human capacity increases the more it is drawn upon.
 It can never be exhausted.

1.Multi-dimensional transitions cannot be brought about by uni-dimensional strategies: The economic dimension of transition cannot be viewed and acted upon in isolation from its political and social dimensions.
 The reform programme was developed and guided by domestic and foreign economists who viewed the transition much like a change of clothing – the casting off of one set of economic principles and the adoption of another – ignoring the critical importance of social and political factors.
 This view could be summed up in the often expressed attitude, ‘Good economics makes good politics!’
 Transition is the process by which society moves from one form or level of activities to another.
 While social scientists conveniently divide social activity into several categories – political, economic, social, educational, religious, cultural – in practice these distinctions are at best only partially true.
 Economic activities in any society take place on the foundation of the political system, social values and customs, and the psychological aspirations and attitudes of the people.
 During normal periods of slow and gradual change, the impact or role of other dimensions operates below the surface and appears minimal.
 Economists studying the results of economic variables tend to overlook the influence of factors from other fields on the assumption that non-economic factors are constant.
 Under relatively stable and static conditions, these economics principles can be employed to predict changes in economic variables to a considerable extent.
 But under circumstances in which underlying economic, social and political conditions are undergoing radical change, the relevance and predictive capacity of purely economic concepts is quite limited.

 This will not be tolerated any longer.

 As they approached the top of the tower, the servant silently stepped aside and, with an open palm, waived Van’dret forward.

 Jason attempted to distract him by running around throwing knives at him but I think Jason was too busy ducking the black stuff that shot out of Kojas’ hands.
 I ran right past all of them and towards Seth.
 I knelt down and smacked him across his good cheek.
 “Ow, what was that for?” he grunted.
 “I don’t have enough bruises for your liking?” “That’s for being a jerk and not telling us you were going to fight Kojas on your own,” I said angrily.
 “Hey in my defense, he found me first.” I opened my mouth to say something smart, but I hear Emily scream.

It was like the stage set for some damn O’Neill play, you know, all whites and grays and shadows.
 But, he greeted us like we were the best thing he’d seen all day.
 And his boss, Mr. Waddell, was a nice guy, a heavy set, crew-cut, ex-Marine, with a face like a catcher’s mitt, and he’d always give us this big, fake hello and hand us all bubble gum.
 Where I first saw Bazooka Joe.
 In Mr. Waddell’s paint store.
 And when dad said goodbye to us, he put a hand tentatively on my shoulder, before letting me go.
 It was the most he ever touched me, you know, that generation, those dads, not the down-on-the-carpet kind of parents.
 But that crappy paint store.
 Man.
 It was killing him, boring him silly.

"You won't be.
 I think it'll be fun."
 She smiled then.
 "Can we watch television today?"
 That pleasure was only one of many that day.
 First she loaded the dishwasher while Rick supervised, and she poured in the soap and started the machine herself.
 After a shower, she had lessons on the use of the food processor, the blender, and--delight of delights--the microwave oven.
 "I can make lunch now," she proclaimed happily.
 "Do you like to cook?"
 "Yes."

“One darn day...” “Emily, are you okay?” I asked.
 Her head shot up and she gave me a big smile.
 “Yup, never better.
 I'm just having a minute to myself.” “Okay...” I trailed off.
 Seth walked over to join us.
 “We should get moving and find somewhere else to stay.
 If we stay and argue in the forest, something worse is bound to find us.” “Right, lead the way,” I said and pushed off the tree.
 Seth nodded and I walked beside him as he led us, once again, through the woods.
 Emily and Jason were talking quietly about something which gave us both the opportunity to talk.
 “You think Kojas sent them?” I mumbled to him and pushed a branch away.

Doom Hoof was barely into a trot before the new opponent came into range.
 Rodregas knew he could not hit straight up against the more heavily armored and mounted opponent.
 So he dropped away from his opponent’s side with speed that his opponent could not match and then stood up in his stirrups and swung his lance into the man.
 That move was similar to one of the moves Doi’van had taught him with the quarterstaff.
 A normal lancer did not have the strength to use the heavy lance in such a way.
 His blow landed high and Rodregas drove his lance into the man’s shoulder.
 Shattered pieces of wood filled the air.
 His opponent flew out of the saddle, an ungainly sight, and landed hard on the arena floor.
 He did not get back up.
 After a few minutes the official signaled Rodregas’ victory.

Sometimes I visited my cousin Jill at her Pacific Beach apartment.
 Jill was nineteen.
 One Friday evening, she hosted a party.
 I drank several beers, then invited somebody who reminded me of Karen Flagstad to join me for a cruise up the coast road to La Jolla.
 Her name was Kris.
 She would go with me, she said, if not for a babysitting job she had that night.
 After she left, I drank more beer.
 Then I drove to a Jack in the Box on the coast road and found Kris there, in a Ford, hanging onto my cousin Jill’s boyfriend, Jimmy Dixon.
 Jimmy was one tough fellow.
 According to rumor, while fighting in the Golden Glove tournament, he had knocked another light-heavyweight into a coma.

Like your brother is any better."
 I turned and went out through the exterior door.
 I was all the way out to the parking lot before I realized that I didn't have a way home.
 I was still trying to figure out what to do, when I heard the deep roar of a high-performance engine.
 Brandon was clear over at the other end of the parking lot, but somehow he saw me and flipped his car around.
 "You're looking just a little stranded."
 "That obvious?"
 His smile was just as radiant and reassuring as always.
 "Only to someone who happens to know your entire schedule, and who just saw what looked like Rachel and James leave without you."
 It was my turn to try and hide a trembling lip as I responded.

“But you better not keep anything else from us or Kojas won't be your problem.” She winked at him and set off with Jason on her heels.
 I think they were going to start arguing about the water war.
 “Great job Seth!” I said and hugged him.
 His eyes seemed to widen in surprise but he didn't tell me to get off.
 I pulled away, blushed, and started to follow Emily's tracks.
 Seth followed behind me and there seemed to be a new spring to his step.
 I couldn't even keep the smile off my face.
 Everything seemed a lot better to me.
 At the top of the hill, Emily and Jason were waiting for us.
 A shadow formed behind them and I screamed for them to turn around.

 Chapter 7: Now the Truth Comes Out My phone is ringing but this time it is the hands free unit in my ear, my real cell phone number, not the crack-berry.
 I am not here alone, in fact there are about twenty undercover officers with me, but I’m no cop.
 On the phone is lead undercover narcotics officer Denny White.
 Officer White wants to do a last minute sound check on the wire that I am wearing taped to my back.
 It seems that my lack of noise has caused the undercover officers who surround me in cars, vans and bushes to become concerned that they have lost sound.
 They haven’t heard a word from me since my last crack-berry conversation with Ashley, the suspect that I have set up in exchange for dropping pending drug dealing charges.
 They are not my charges.
 They belong to my son.

Lousy song, but it brings back memories, and how they got a hold of it, I can’t imagine.
 A really, rough, live “The Sun Also Rises.”
 CM:  	I don’t—
 BG:  	Fever Tree.
 I’ll educate you, yet.
 We used to try to work up a version of “The Sun Also Rises” because I could make my voice sound like his raspy delivery—likewise Sky Saxon of The Seeds.
 Which is why “Can’t Seem to Make Her Mine” shows up on the bootleg, also.
 A better version of it, than “Sun”—actually part studio, part live, if you can dig that.
 At least, whoever put the fucker together had some chops, knew a thing or two—it’s a fairly seamless melding of two different versions of the song, incorporating a blistering solo I did on it live with a somewhat coherent rendering we put down at Ardent.
 “Can’t Seem to Make Her Mine” should have been huge for The Seeds, yet it only charted, barely.

 Don’t tell me about Nixon, Crafty or his reptilian lawyer.

Already ongoing wars are being fought in the Balkans, the Caucasus and several other regions of the former Soviet Union.
 Crime is on the rise.
 Ominous signs have appeared that the authoritarian past is not yet fully buried and could once again arise, if the forward momentum of the transition process does not quickly improve the lives of people within the region.
 The whole world has an immense stake in the successful outcome of the transition in Eastern Europe.
 Initial Results of Reform
 The pre-existent conditions, the starting point of the transition, the timing, speed and extent of the reforms introduced during the past five years varied considerably among the 25 nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
 But, with few exceptions, they were founded on the same general principles and on the policy recommendations of Western proponents of rapid transformation to total free-market liberal capitalism, based on a simultaneous shock strategy encompassing macro-economic stabilization, prices and property rights.
 Western governments and the international financial institutions, led by the IMF, strongly advocated this approach and linked financial assistance to its adoption.
 The strategy called for rapid deregulation of prices, privatization of farms and industry, introduction of a convertible currency, and balancing the budget to reduce the high fiscal deficits, primarily by reducing military expenditure and subsidies to producers and consumers.
 The assumption was that a programme with these elements would result in a significant increase in production, efficiency and the availability of consumer goods within a short time.

Something to eat perhaps?
 Or if you'd rather, I can show you to the theater."
 I chopped off a hysterical burst of laughter just before it managed to emerge full force and totally embarrass me.
 Of course Alec had a theater in his house.
 Probably a pool and a gym too.
 Along with a half-dozen other amenities I'd never think of, but that the ultra-rich simply couldn't do without.
 I pulled my erratic, pointless thoughts back into a compact, nearly sensible ball, and shook my head as I did my best to give him a genuine smile.
 "No thanks.
 I probably won't be hungry for several hours still.
 Is there a library in the house perhaps?"

Repeatedly.
 I felt all kinds of defeated before we’d gone half an hour.
 After watching us for a while, Steed stepped in to save me.
 “Frey”—he’d converted to the nickname the others used in place of the sunnier ones—“why don’t you take a break for a while?
 Let us spar so you can watch.
 We’ll give you a few pointers.” I didn’t know if I liked the idea of the group sparring, whether it gave me a break from the torture or not, but Grey stepped forward and my opinion no longer mattered.
 “Just watch and learn.” I backed away and sat cross-legged on the ground.
 Ruby joined me; I could tell she was excited.
 It seemed everything excited Ruby.
 Everything that makes me nervous, I amended in my head.

I decided that I didn’t want to be shredded like some old rug, so I moved out of his path.
 That was the worst mistake I made, without even realizing it.
 At the same time another Thrasher was heading in my direction, and by moving out of the way from the first one, I had placed myself in the path of the second one.
 It slammed into my side at such a great force I tasted blood in my mouth, when I hit the ground.
 Then I felt pain, saw blood, and then nothing at all.
 Chapter 4
 I heard muffled voices around me as I regained consciousness.
 My head throbbed slightly, and so did my side and my tongue.
 That explained why I had tasted blood; I must have bitten it.
 For a second I thought I had returned to my human self when I heard a blast of fire that probably came from Emily.

Slinking past Fannie’s room, I headed for her makeshift vault.
 She kept all the things I wasn’t allowed to touch in that room; it was supposed to be off limits.
 Not that I’d bothered trying much, because there was a large flat stone—covering where it hid in the floor—that I’d never been able to move.
 But that was before.
 I wasn’t sure how the magic had worked with the bird, but I knew it had, so I dropped to my knees, held my hands above the stone, and closed my eyes, concentrating with everything I had.
 Nothing happened right away, and my mind wandered a bit with thoughts of what might be inside, how I wanted to see and needed to touch my family heirlooms.
 The things that belonged to my mother.
 The stone lid scraped across the floor as it shifted.
 It didn’t go far, but I hadn’t needed much.
 I reached down and drew out a small leather pouch, its bronzed decorations weathered and worn.

They heard my sobs.
 I was aware of their eyes on me before they uncomfortably turned away again.
 Chevelle approached me warily as I lay curled in a ball on my blankets, the book positioned in front of me.
 He tossed it aside but I no longer cared.
 He sat behind me and pulled me into his arms, holding me as I wept.
 It was more right than anything had been in a long, long time.
 I woke with new resolve.
 I stood, prepared to make things right, but something was… off.
 The group surrounded me, tense.
 I glanced around but couldn’t see why.

“What is inside?” she asked as she took the box.
 “Open it,” Harruq said.
 “You’ll see.”
 Aurelia pried off the lid and peered inside.
 A small bouquet of flowers lay on the bottom of the box.
 She lifted them up, smiling at the violets, blues, and reds.
 “That’s sweet Harruq, but why?”
 “Just to, you know.” He kicked a rock.
 “Wanted to thank you for sparring with me,” he said.
 “They’re beautiful,” Aurelia said as she inhaled the aroma.

“Oh my gods he had burned!” Rodregas thought in alarm.
 He quickly raised his hand to his eyes, but instead of his scarred, wrinkled hand that should have been seared by burns; there was a powerful smooth hand.
 Rodregas reached up and touched his face.
 “Dear Gods,” he thought in amazement, “the trigger words had worked.” He had done what he had learned to despise and hate most of all; he had switched into the body of an innocent man.
 “I am an Immortalist,” thought Rodregas in dismay.
 It had been his only shot at survival, and the young man had already been dead in all ways that mattered, but still it was an act of incredible repugnance to him.
 He thought, “Once again I have done what I needed to survive.” As Rodregas lay on the floor he looked up at the stars and the looming figure of the captain.
 He had to think quickly.
 It was instant death for anyone to interfere with an Immortalist Ascension ceremony.
 It was the most stringent rule enforced by the Guild of the Celestial Path, and therefore the most enforced rule in the Eastern Realm.

The rest of the elves were in full retreat.
 He was the only one left.
 Qurrah watched Dieredon’s approach with a gnawing fear in his chest.
 It seemed no hand could touch this one, the horse possessing dexterity beyond what any creature that size should have.
 Velixar showed no sign of being aware of their approach.
 His eyes had rolled back into his head as he controlled the multitude of magical hands.
 “Be gone,” Qurrah said, firing several pieces of bone.
 All pieces missed.
 He tried to cast another hemorrhage spell but the words felt heavy and drunk on his tongue.
 His mind ached, his chest heaved, and when the spell finished it created nothing but a wound the size of an arrowhead in the side of Sonowin.

It guaranteed that the squires stayed focused during meditation.
 Doi’van and Imeralda looked at him as he knelt in the grass with the sword naked on his bare arms.
 Rodregas spoke carefully so as not to tip the sword and said, “It is called sword meditation.
 My instructor would start us out with the prayer and then we would meditative on our duty.” “For how long?” asked Imeralda.
 “Until you are sure of what your duty is,” Rodregas replied, hearing the voice of his old drill Knight Captain.
 All the instructors had been retired knights who enjoyed teaching the squires.
 He did not think the two would join him for this but both pulled their weapons and imitated his position, Doi’van with his large great sword balanced on his powerful arms, Imeralda grabbed her bow instead of a short sword, which with her lack of training was probably a good idea.
 Rodregas focused inwards and resumed his meditation.
 He was finding it wonderful to do the meditation again; Rodregas had a lot of good memories from his life as a squire, before everything had gone wrong.
 Part of him felt uncomfortable for doing this again, like he no longer had the right.

The councilman’s body was disposed of, and the group bustled around the clearing.
 I slid my sword into its sheath, careful not to touch the blade.
 I hadn’t comprehended what the flourish of activity meant until Ruby grabbed my arm to conduct me.
 “Come on, we have to pack.” She dragged me along as she rushed back to her house.
 She threw things around her room, sorting and gathering.
 I didn’t really have anything to assemble.
 There was only the pack I’d acquired months ago, nothing in it but that stupid white dress and the pouch… The pouch.
 I hurried from the room, explaining to Ruby I would be getting ready for the trip.
 “I already put your pack in the front room for Chevelle.” “I’ll just check it,” I said.
 “Thanks.” I found the pack with some of Chevelle’s things.

He was not challenging him.
 Doi’van was clearly asking himself the same thing.
 He looked over at Rodregas and shrugged.
 “We both have the power of the Infernal Realm in us.
 Is it easier for us to manage following the path of righteousness to let the power burn free or to take on the form of a greater sigil and bind the Infernal magic to a specific form?
 I think we must choose carefully.” Doi’van said and added, “For me the Bunei seems right.” Doi’van paused in that thoughtful way he had, considering all sides before taking action.
 “If it consumes my Infernal power I would gain its strengths.
 If I am lucky, what magic ability I have left will be mortal or Celestial in nature.

And then I laughed, because I couldn’t even trust myself.
 I expected him to look at me like I was mad.
 Instead, he looked like it was… endearing.
 He stood and walked over to me, taking my hand to help me up.
 When he touched me, I tried to fight the heat that ran up my neck.
 I couldn’t and embarrassment caused my cheeks to color as well.
 I peered up at him through my now-dark bangs and could have sworn it amused him.
 I laughed at myself.
 The silly romance I’d been reading in the diary must have been affecting me.
 I tried to stop my thoughts from returning there as we practiced, but it was near impossible.

“Doi’van, Imeralda,” he said getting their attention.
 “I have not told you much about my past.
 But, as a teenager I served as a squire of the knightly Order of the Soaring Heavens”.
 At their nod he added,”I was never raised to knighthood, as I had neither the noble lineage nor the martial prowess.
 My life as a squire was a good life, one I appreciated more afterwards than when I was living it.
 Both the knights and the squires always started off the day with a prayer to the Celestial Gods.
 I have not done this in over forty years, but I am going to start again and I would like you to join me if you would.” The two looked at Rodregas, they were very different people, but they both seemed unsure what to say to his request.
 Finally, Doi’van nodded at Imeralda and said to Rodregas, “It has been too long since I have prayed as well, it would be good for the soul.
 Please lead us in prayer.” Imeralda did not say anything, but she nodded and followed the two of them outside.
 Rodregas knelt in the grass facing the sun, the sign of the All-Father in the celestial heavens.

 Still dressed in summery type clothing.
 Still smiling and enjoying the weather.
 Greg walks up to her, looking unkempt and hunted.

 Cindy:  oh it’s absolutely beautiful.

“Um,” I choked out in surprise as I was squeezed, “I wanted it to be…uh…a surprise.” I managed to get the words out and seem intelligent.
 My mom released me from her clamp-like hug, “Well I am surprised, and very proud!” “Thank you?” I said slowly.
 This must have been the dwarf’s plan.
 Would have been nice if he had warned me, I thought bitterly.
 My dad got up and glowed happily behind my mom.
 “We are very proud, Jazell.
 You’re supposed to leave tomorrow, so you better pack.” “I’m going to go do that.” I said quickly, while I backed up towards the stairs.
 As soon as I reached them, I shot up so fast you would think I was running for my life.
 I closed the door, locking it behind me and then dialed Emily’s cell phone as fast as I could.
 I sat on my bed as the phone rang three times before I heard it click.

Rodregas looked up from his examination of a strange bull daemon and looked for Doi’van.
 He must have been more familiar with the powers of the various creatures.
 Doi’van had walked past many of the figures until he stood at one toward the back.
 The shape was a powerfully built dragon with wings partially spread as if getting ready to fly.
 But unlike a real dragon this one had three heads at the end of long serpentine necks; one was that of a wolf, one was of an eagle and one was of a lion.
 “What is it?” he asked Doi’van.
 “A Bunei.
 They are powerful fighters, but also lead packs of daemons in combat and have powerful magical abilities.
 Most of these others are powerful and dangerous, but a Bunei is more than a simple fighter of the Infernals.
 I am actually surprised to see they’re with the other beasts.

"Now I won't have to wash my clothes every night."
 He looked down at her with chagrin.
 "I didn't even think about that.

 I'll do that tomorrow."
 "But we're going to the shore."
 "I'll show you when we get home.

Even as Doi’van nodded he slapped his open palm against Van’dret’s mouth and used his other hand to grab one of the sorcerer’s free hands.
 Rodregas grabbed the other.
 “Put him on the ground and kneel on him,” Rodregas said to Doi’van.
 The Hellborn nodded and pushed the sorcerer down on the cold stone ground.
 He next straddled the man with his knees, pining his shoulders.
 “I am going to ask him a few questions.
 If either of you think he is going to cast a spell, kill him.” The other two nodded at Rodregas.
 Rodregas reached down and slid the blade under the sorcerer’s chin and said, “One spell and you die,” he then nodded to Doi’van and the Hellborn lifted his hand a few inches from Van’dret’s mouth.
 Van’dret whispered, “Please, I am bleeding.
 I need to see a healer.” Rodregas stared at the sorcerer in disbelief.

She kissed him, her hands moving restlessly over his chest.
 Nuzzling his ear, she told him, "It's probably wrong for me to tell you these things.
 But I want to tell you everything.
 I want you to know how I feel."
 Rick pulled her onto his lap and began devouring her mouth.
 If he didn't know better, he'd swear she was the most cunning seductress he'd ever known.
 Her innocence combined with her confession was a powerful aphrodisiac.
 She was so trusting and yet so passionate, her mouth as hungry as his, her hands caressing and clutching and clawing at his chest and shoulders and neck.
 Hadn't she understood a word he'd said?
 Rick let the embrace go on for as long as he could.

 Art – Are you sure?
 Because given some time I can actually sound like I have a clue what I’m talking about.
 It’s not as useful per-say, but it sounds a lot better if you ever decide that you need a quote for a newspaper advertisement.
 You could have a picture of a handsome male model smiling and giving a thumbs-up sign with the line ‘Art says: this stuff is terrifatastic!’
 Liz – I’m sure.
 I need some feedback on my work, and mother isn’t saying anything but ‘mmmmm hmmmm, I like that’ and ‘no no no no, that would never sell Darling.’  So far my mother is the only person who I’ve talked to about it, and she only thinks about my work in a monetary fashion.
 It’s hard to grow without any criticism to help me light my way.
 Art - Terrifitastic, the best parts of terrific and fantastic all rolled into one super term.
 I think I’m actually going to use that from now on.

 “Excuses.” “Listen guys,” Seth said, “I have something to tell you.” He looked at me and I nodded.

As soon as she went to bed, he’d get the article out and reread it.
 Rick heard a sniffle.
 He looked in time to see Marie take a swipe at her eyes.
 “Please don’t cry, sweetheart,” he said, taking the knife and mushroom from her and drawing her into his arms.
 “It’s just so confusing and frightening.”  She hid her face against his chest.
 “I don’t know how I got here, I don’t know why it happened, and worst of all, I don’t know how to get back.”  Her body shook with sobs.
 Rick’s heart broke for her.
 “I’m sorry, sweetheart,” he murmured, stroking her hair.
 As her sobs began to subside, he tightened his arms around her and pressed his lips to her ear to whisper, “Maybe you came to 2011 because there’s someone here to help you and care about you.” She pulled back a little and managed a small smile for him.
 “At least that’s an explanation I can live with.”  She took the handkerchief he offered her.

With his arm around her shoulders, he eased her down onto the sofa.
 She writhed beneath his weight, moaning.
 She'd never be able to leave him once they'd made love.
 His mouth ravaged hers as he pressed her deeper into the cushions.
 Panting, he raised his head and pulled back enough to unbutton her blouse.
 Marie gazed up into his eyes.
 "I love you, Rick."
 He froze.
 Her eyes were clear and loving and .

They dug a large hole in a corner and then bled the body dry, letting the fluids soak into the dirt.
 Occasionally, they would halt and listen, worried their violent struggle had reached unwanted ears.
 No curious investigators arrived, however, and they continued with their dark deed.
 When the blood dripping from the elf’s wounds became but a trickle, they filled the hole and moved on.
 Using the clothes and robes from upstairs, the two brothers wiped away as much of Ahrqur’s blood as they could.
 They tossed the bloody clothes, the table, and the pieces of glass they into the fireplace and burned them.
 Harruq wrapped the body in spare blankets he found in a closet.
 “Grab the sword,” he said as he hoisted the dead elf onto his shoulder.
 “I have it,” Qurrah said, retrieving the elven blade and its dark green sheath from the floor.
 They gave one last look around.

It turned out they did.
 An arrow flew across the room and pierced his shoulder when he reached the second floor.
 He bellowed, letting the pain spark his rage.
 One archer continued to fire out the window, believing his companion capable of finishing a single warrior.
 He believed wrong.
 The elf fired only one more shot before Harruq crossed the room.
 The arrow lodged into Harruq’s side, and then Salvation tore through his bow and into flesh.
 A kick sent the remains tumbling out the window.
 The other archer pulled back and fired at point blank range.
 Harruq roared as he felt a sharp pain bite into his neck.

“We will kill the elves,” Harruq said.
 The man in black nodded and then dismissed his bone general.
 “Go.
 Patch your wounds.”
 The half-orc bowed and then joined his brother.
 The two journeyed across the hills and then snuck inside Woodhaven.
 When they reached their home, Harruq removed his armor and began wrapping strips of old cloth around his wounds.
 Qurrah watched him for a moment before speaking.
 “You know what you must do, should it come to it,” he said.
 Harruq nodded, knowing exactly what he meant.

However, preservation of physical security against external aggression is a primal instinct of nation states that cannot be rationalized away.
 Nations will continue to arm themselves as long as that is the only effective means to ensure their security.
 What is needed is a quantum shift from the competitive security paradigm to a cooperative security system in which countries mutually and collectively agree to refrain from acts of aggression and to protect each other from such acts by any nation.
 This principle served to protect the NATO and Warsaw Pact countries in the past, but on an exclusive basis which promoted a polarization of alliances into military blocs and, most importantly, left more than one hundred countries outside the security orbit and vulnerable to proxy wars.
 It should now be restructured on a global basis as a collective security system that offers protection to all nations from external aggression.
 A whole range of new security challenges is rising to confront the global society.
 The increasing number, complexity and unpredictability of security threats cannot be managed effectively and in time without international cooperation based on a fundamental change of attitude.
 We are now at an historic crossroads: one path leads us back to a static, unstable and exclusive competitive security paradigm; the other leads to a far more stable and dynamic cooperative security paradigm inclusive of all nations and responsive to future needs and challenges.
 A global cooperative security system is needed that seeks to strengthen national security without increasing the insecurity of other states.
 It should be based on the fundamental principle that force will no longer be tolerated by the international community as a legitimate instrument of national policy.

I studiously ignored Alec, even though I could all but feel him glaring at me the entire time.
 When the bell finally rang, Mrs. Alexander looked up from her white board with a startled expression.
 "I suppose that's it then.
 Don't forget to turn in your assignments on your way out."
 Anxious to make sure I got credit for all the work I'd done, I hurried up to the front of the class before Alec could get to his feet.
 "Oh, Adriana.
 It looks like you've been busy."
 She took my handwritten report, and then held out a hand as Alec approached.
 "Somehow I rather suspect you both have the same answer, Alec just used twice as many words to get there."
 I shot Alec another dirty look, but it slid right off the armor of his arrogance.

Brandon was very ill detoxing, and the fact that he had been busted and he was on lockdown at his parents’ house was common knowledge on the street.
 There’s no easy way to bluff if everyone sees your cards.
 Officer White cooked up a scheme.
 He gave Brandon a phone number and a story for him to give to Steve.
 Hopefully this story would explain Brandon’s bust, now known by all of his associates: He was to acknowledge his bust and tell Steve that the cops didn’t catch him with drugs because no one would front him the Oxy he was to bring to the deal.
 Brandon owed everyone, including Steve, so that would not be difficult to believe.
 In fact, that part was the truth!
 He was then supposed to tell Steve that he needed help supplying one of his regulars while his parents were holding him with a tight leash and ask him if he could do it.
 All Brandon was asking for in return for this connection was a few Oxy pills dropped at our house as a referral fee.
 Brandon asked Steve to just put the pills on his windowsill so he could get high unbeknownst to his parents.

The tedium of my duties is getting to me and Father has been relentless with my studies, pushing me harder and harder to strengthen my control.
 My sister has been exploring the mountains.
 I see her bring in all sorts of interesting finds, but she refuses to tell me where she got them.
 I wish there were a way to sneak out.
 I would follow her or force her to show me, but Father is keeping a close eye on me, making certain I stick to a strict schedule.
 This morning he brought in a detailed list for Rune, giving him direction through a series of tasks.
 Rune is supposed to grade me on them, see which I excel most at so they can pick a specific field to concentrate on.
 I don’t know how extensive it was, but I saw ‘wind,’ ‘water,’ ‘growth,’ ‘transfer,’ ‘fire,’ and ‘foresight’ written as it passed between them.
 We had already done months of fire.
 Pass it through water, see how large a flame I can create, see how hot I can go, test me on this, test me on that.

The tent is ripped from the ground and tumbles away leaving a clear view of the black helicopter that is lowering itself closer to the ground.
 The helicopter is about thirty feet above the ground, and now just behind the podium, over the limos.
 The side door slides open revealing two men in black suits.
 Everyone starts to dive for cover.
 I am seated next to Grandpa but I am now flat on the ground with the rest of the crowd attempting to duck the flying flowers, tripods, and debris, expecting a shower of bullets.
 Chairs are scattering as they tip over and who knows what those two men in the helicopter are going to do?
 I look up and the only man standing is Grandpa who has his arms in the air as the wind from the copter pounds him and ripples his suit like a flag in the wind.
 This deeply religious (and senile) old man proclaims loudly “the lord has come to take my son!” and he continues to repeat this line as if he is a TV preacher in a revival tent.
 I have an eye on the copter and a hand on Grandpa’s leg as I attempt to pull him to the ground with the rest of us.
 People are barely audible but they are screaming and crying and in total panic.

“I believe so.
 He tests us again.”
 Harruq patted his swords.
 “So be it.
 What’s the plan?”
 Qurrah could see two men positioned on either side of the campfire.
 They kept their backs to the fire and sat far enough away so their eyes would not fully adjust to its light.
 They camped within a sparse copse of trees, the trunks not nearly thick enough to hide their approach.
 “They are wise and alert,” he whispered.
 “Perhaps I can get close enough to cast a spell on one or two.

A cook in a monastery.
 Even if I can't let go of Zoë, I could more thoroughly rid myself of ambition.
 Maybe I should give up writing.
 Or hand over Perelandra College to someone.
 Spend more time growing vegetables and cooking from scratch, like Brother Lawrence did.
 Toni Torrey could give me gardening and cooking lessons.
 For lessons in devoting myself to communion with God, besides contemplating Brother Lawrence, I can turn to Olga.

My mind filled with thoughts of my son going to prison with my inability to deliver Steve to the narcotics officers to satisfy Brandon’s deal with them.
 The call from the officer came in on my headset and it was to the point; I was instructed to head back to the spot where I was wired (“home-base”) so I began my short journey back, completely disappointed.
 The entourage of police came out of parking spots and the marked cars came from behind the building and out of nowhere.
 It was as if a sudden parade had emerged from nowhere folding in behind me as I exited the parking lot.
 I arrived at the original briefing spot and I got out of the truck and the lead officer immediately began to tell me this was a good first contact and that I would get them.
 I tried to interrupt him with my feelings of distress but he would have no part of it.
 He complimented me on holding my ground so firmly.
 In fact, he and his partner asked me if I had done this before because I was so stern with her and refused to bend.
 I guess they were accustomed to dealing with strung out drug addicts.
 I was still completely disappointed and I told them so.

He was on the wrestling team, second man in the 165-pound class and challenging the first man, who was part orangutan.
 I outweighed Eric by 20 pounds, but he was stronger and faster.
 No matter in what position we started, at his pleasure and with maddening ease, he flipped me over and pinned me.
 Wondering why, after I had spilled my guts, he appeared to revel in my further humiliation, I flew into a rage, sprang to my knees, and socked him in the stomach.
 I pounced on top of him and socked him again, before he caught hold and flipped me, lashed my arm behind my back and shoved my face into the floor.
 “Listen,” he said, without a hint of condemnation, “you’re not really mad at me.
 You’re mad at yourself, because you think you’re nobody, but you’ve got it all wrong.
 It doesn’t matter if I wrestle better.
 Wrestling’s my sport.
 What if you and I were playing golf or baseball and you clobbered one out of sight, but I hit this little dribbler, then started whining?

Somehow the porch light didn't reach out as far into the yard as I'd remembered.
 Alec appeared on the edge of the light with such suddenness that a startled yelp escaped me despite my best efforts.
 "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you."
 Strangely enough, I believed him.
 He was moving with the same, over-controlled care I'd seen him use around Rachel.
 "It's okay, it must be really limiting to always have to pretend you're slow and normal."
 His expression took on an alien cast, as he shrugged.
 "Actually I've spent so much of my life trying to hide the unusual aspects of my nature, it's usually effortless.
 For some reason, I forget myself around you."
 There was something to his voice, but even after he'd hinted at having strong feelings for me, it was hard to really believe it all.

The soldier instinctively pulled his hand back, giving Aurelia the opening she needed.
 She squirmed out from beneath, gripped her staff, and then whirled.
 The wood cracked against the back of his skull, knocking him against the wall just as hard.
 Blood splattered from his broken nose.
 “You’ll pay for—”
 The end of her staff dislodged two more of his teeth.
 The soldier panicked and turned to run, but found his feet entangled.
 Aurelia marched over, remembering how difficult it had been to strike Harruq and how strong a blow he could take without showing pain.
 “Are you as strong as a half-orc?” she asked.
 Her staff collided with his ribs.

I finished early, but I should have started on one of the catch-up assignments.
 I just didn't want to get into a whole new subject with only ten minutes left."
 Her smile was much more understanding than normal for a classroom situation.
 It took the sting out of the words that were probably just for the people close enough to overhear.
 "Don't you worry, Miss Paige, I'll let you know when I don't think you're keeping up.
 Seeing as you are done though, would you please run something over to Mrs. North?
 I'd do it, but I need to go to a special projects meeting today during lunch."
 As quickly as that, my books were in my backpack and I was on my way to the second story of the school, which housed music, sketching, and all the other forms of art lesser mortals like me would never master.
 The journey would've been completely unremarkable except that I happened to glance into one of the classrooms just before I found Mrs. North's room.
 Even a brief glance screamed art students.

I think I can arrange it so neither of you will be back for a year or two.
 That should be more than enough time for this all to resolve itself one way or another."
 I felt my eyes go wide with panic as I realized what he was proposing.
 "Wait.
 No.
 You can't do that."
 I tried to grab a hold of his arm, but he'd already taken several steps away.
 The pleasant tingly feeling was gone, but that loss was nothing against the sense of cold abandonment rushing through me.
 I tried to step forward, tried to follow him, but my vision was dimming and my heart felt like it was about to explode.
 I managed a single step before my knees collapsed and the ground jumped up to meet me.

I had so many questions I still wanted answered, but it didn't seem fair to get Isaac in any more trouble than he was already in.
 "Will you be okay?
 I mean with Alec.
 He's not going to torture you or anything for telling me, is he?"
 Isaac's smile somehow completed his face.
 Funny how I'd never thought there was anything wrong with it before, but after finally being rewarded with something more than his normal, serious countenance, I had the first hint why he was one of Rachel's favorites among the pack.
 "It's likely I'll be exceedingly sore for the next few days, and my ego, such as it is, will likely take quite the beating, but our Kir'shan, our Alpha as you would say, isn't a bad sort."
 That was a relief.
 It also meant I knew exactly what I was going to do when I saw Alec next.
 Half an hour later, I was following him down the hall towards Physics and wishing I'd had more time to prepare.

 He’s to continue my practice.
 Chevelle approached during his pacing and I slid the book into my pack, pretending to examine the beading on the material of the dress.
 This seemed to disturb him.
 He avoided pacing near me the rest of the evening, throwing me odd glances now and again.
 I shrugged it off and went back to reading.

“Yes, well, that would have been easy enough.” “And Junnie prefers to hunt… for sport?” He had that look again and I wondered why he would be so cautious.
 Because I was dangerous?
 A practitioner of dark magic?
 “No.
 Some prefer the meat not to be tainted by magic.
 They feel it is more… pure.” He pronounced ‘tainted’ with an edge.
 “Is it?
 Tainted I, mean?” “I have lived on it for—” His words caught midsentence and he said, “Well, it doesn’t seem to be, but to each his own.” He turned back to the fire.
 Junnie came back into view, a large animal slung over her shoulders, bow in hand.
 She dropped her burden on a smooth gray rock near the fire and whispered a short thanks before removing the arrow to skin the animal.

Chevelle brought me a plate of food, settling in beside me.
 There were berries and roots, and a rich, savory meat that dripped onto my hands as I tore into it.
 It was a feast compared to what I’d been eating.
 And even though he was my watcher, my captor, I had to admit I felt less alone with Chevelle there.
 Steed pulled his own ration from the spit and sat on my other side as we all watched the surface of the lake.
 And beyond it, mountains.
 The mountains at dawn were so much more intimidating and I was hesitant to leave our camp.
 Everything had begun to seem real.
 I tried to distract myself as we rode east around the lake, attempting to name the species of plants as Junnie might have made me, but there were so many I had never seen that it started to remind me of the difference rather than distract me from it.
 So I bantered with Steed regarding horses and imps and everything I could come up with to keep him talking.

he asked her after sampling his own.
 "Delicious.

 "Fine."
 He seemed preoccupied, so she just concentrated on enjoying her food, the candlelight, and the music.

 "Ready for dessert?"
 Davis asked her as the waiter removed their plates.

I thought at first you both had a sigil of healing, that would be the only way for you two to be alive, but Imeralda says that you are both ‘of the blood.’ You are a lucky man, even with your blood, to be alive.” “May I speak to them?” Rodregas asked as he looked around the room or tent.
 He was amazed that somehow they had found a safe place to recover from the battle.
 “Of course, but let’s get something just a bit more hardy in you and maybe we can move you around a bit.
 Your body has sat still too long.
 Then, you will take a nap.
 “When you awake I will get you Imeralda.
 Doi’van is doing better than you, but I don’t think he is up to doing any visiting yet.” Rodregas nodded in relief at his words and soon enough he was once again sleeping.
 The next day, sometime around midmorning judging from the light coming in through the opening that seemed to function like a window, Imeralda entered along with a young handsome Nymph.
 He was tall with green hair and with a confident bearing to his presence.
 He greeted Rodregas with a very bright smile.

 So, sophomore year was Birdie Burton.
 Shit.
 Should we use real names here?
 I guess, it’s ok.
 I don’t want Debby’s name here, that’s all—her real name, just because.
 Just out of respect for my first love, you know, and the first heart I broke.
 I broke her heart.
 And with Birdie I lost my virginity.

The eyes that stared back at me in the reflection grew large as they took in her mastery.
 Gone was the girl I’d been in the village.
 This woman, dressed in leather and dabbed with war paint, was striking, imposing even.
 Her dark gaze might have been fierce if it weren’t round with astonishment.
 Ruby was thrilled at my response.
 She bounced twice and clapped her hands at her success.
 And then she was over it.
 “Let’s eat.
 I’m famished.” She fired a look back at me, her hair flipping in the process.

It was there, leading my horse and seeing through his eyes, that the pain struck.
 It came on instantaneously, hitting me like a blade, cutting, shearing.
 It was accompanied by sharpness of sound as well.
 My ears were in excruciating pain.
 The horse dropped, his head smacked to the ground and I watched through his eyes as he hit.
 The animal’s senses stilled, not panicked as my own.
 I didn’t understand what was happening, couldn’t quite form a thought.
 I yearned to retreat into the horse, run from the agony, but the severity of it tore me back and kept me there in my own head.
 It felt and sounded like metal bands inside my mind, inside my ears, screeching.
 I hadn’t opened my eyes again and now I couldn’t.

 “So that’s how you always showed up behind me,” he said as he got to his feet.

 “That magic blue thingie is a portal,” Aurelia said, her arms crossed over her chest as she held her elbows.
 “And yes, that is how I did it.”
 Harruq shrugged, glancing about as he tried to get his bearings.
 A thought hit him, harder than any whacks of Aurelia’s staff.
 “Qurrah!” he gasped.
 “You’ve got to send me back.”
 “I can’t,” Aurelia said, her eyes fixed west.

 "Just a minute."
 Seconds later his door opened, and he blinked down at her sleepily.
 "You're already dressed?"
 "Yes."

Much like me, Junnie was practically alone.
 Her family had all received the calling “to serve elfkind.” I didn’t know exactly what that meant, only that the elf usually left with fanfare and seldom returned in fewer than a hundred years.
 It was apparently a very honorable thing, though she never seemed proud.
 Just off the living area was the study, larger than the front room, stuffed full of documents and lit by a pair of dim oil lanterns.
 Dust covered the decrepit scrolls and books lining the walls, but aside from a well-used worktable, the room was clean.
 Settling onto my usual stool, I leaned forward, elbows on the carved edge of the table to prop my head up for the monotonous hours to come.
 It was hard to say how long I sat so, looking down on a huge volume entitled The Great Elves of Varkenshire, pretending to read.
 But my eyes had wandered from the page to a small thistle where it rested among some other potion ingredients.
 It had begun to extend its leaves.
 I was startled; Junnie was preoccupied with a lengthy scroll across the room and couldn’t have possibly been the source, and I had never made anything grow.

I was halfway through my class before I realized Mr. Simms had been shooting me dark looks for the last twenty minutes.
 They weren't the obvious nasty looks that kids shoot each other of course.
 They were subtle and infrequent but there was something about the set of his mouth that made it clear he wasn't pleased I was in his class.
 I shrugged it all off and gutted my way through class, eagerly planning what I'd say to Alec when I saw him in physics, only when I finally stalked into Mrs. Alexander's class Alec wasn't sitting in his corner desk.
 I pulled out my notes and started reviewing what I'd managed to learn about our project, stalling until he arrived so I could give him a piece of my mind.
 Only he never walked through the door.
 I still had my anger, but it wasn't cushioning me as well for some reason.
 It felt like another attack was on the way.
 My pulse was skyrocketing and the room wavered as my vision dimmed.
 It didn't make sense to be having a panic attack right now, but images of Cindi swam into view, alternating with pictures of Alec and Rachel.

In a region as vast and diverse as this and in countries such as Russia, which extends over eleven time zones, no single model or pattern will be widely applicable.
 Therefore, several areas in each country representing different economic and social conditions should be selected for establishment of model transition programmes.
 In each area, a study should be conducted of resources and economic potentials, existing institutions and infrastructure, current levels of skill and social attitudes regarding the market system.
 Detailed strategies should be devised to educate the public about untapped opportunities, strengthen the institutional infrastructure, impart needed skills, establish catalytic demonstrations and encourage multiplication of successful new activities.
 A plan should be adopted at the forthcoming UN Social Summit for establishing model district programmes in Eastern and Central European countries.
 Plans for transition should cover all of the factors listed above, providing trained personnel to assist in the establishment and initial operation of new institutions and systems.
 7.Plan for institutional development: An assessment of the type and functioning of existing institutions and economic systems should be compiled to identify missing links that need to be provided to support the transition.
 Based on this study, a master plan should be drawn up for establishing the necessary institutions and systems in each country.
 In order to prepare a cadre of managers for private sector industry and institutions, specialized institutes of management should be set up in each country.
 8.Launch a massive programme to impart new skills and attitudes to the population: In countries where private enterprise was extinguished for decades, entrepreneurial, financial and marketing skills can be extremely limited.

And the frog that had exploded on my white gown—I had been there for a mere instant.
 Their minds were so small, so simple, it was like nothing.
 The horse was different.
 It was watching for predators, concentrating on the path, its steps, carrying a load.
 I tried to find another animal to experiment on.
 Our group wasn’t exactly small or quiet, so I was sure we’d scared most of the larger animals off.
 I wondered if I could figure out a way to locate them without seeing where they were first.
 I thought of the wolves.
 If I had an animal trained, I could call it to me to use at my leisure.
 I had no idea where they were now.

“It doesn’t matter!” Jeremiah shouted.
 “Tell the others!”
 The man went to do as ordered.
 He had not the heart to argue, not with the fear of his nightmare still lingering.
 He spread the word to the rest searching the town.
 “Ashhur help us,” Corren suddenly whispered.
 “Hurry.
 I feel they have arrived.”
 A warcry rolled from the east, a primal, mindless roar that shook every man in the village.
 “Flee west,” Jeremiah ordered Corren.

“And Grey.” The wiry man bent and straightened, his movements too quick.
 I drew in a startled breath as two more figures came into view.
 A pair of slender elves stepped in sync as they stopped just outside the group.
 They were tall and lean, dressed in robes the color of ash that only accentuated their shocking silver hair.
 I was convinced the moonlight must have been exaggerating it.
 And then I jumped again as, on either side of them, two beasts walked forward to stand just in front of the twinned elves.
 Steed brushed an arm against mine, mumbling under his breath, “Yeah, they’re not from around here.” I felt myself leaning on Chevelle for support.
 “Rhys and Rider Strong,” he said from behind me.
 They nodded and I was surprised the small gesture also seemed in step.
 A strange whine emanated from one of the dogs as they shifted to sit on their haunches.

My pout met with just as much success as it usually did.
 After a second or two I gave up and nodded.
 "Okay, I promise to be good and concentrate on getting better, if you'll come keep me company."
 The flash of emotion, barely visible in Alec's eyes, was a source of hope and despair all at once.
 Eagerness, desire.
 Both curbed by the same iron will that'd continued fighting long past where most people would've given up and died.
 I patted the bed next to me, wincing slightly as even that simple motion pulled on things that weren't meant to be pulled on.
 He stared at me for several seconds, and then sat down on the bed.
 I waited, and then when I was sure that was as close as he planned on getting, I slid closer, resting my head on his arm.
 As long as I was careful not to go too far, not to touch too much of him, I could get away with that much.

My Freya has grown into a stubborn and willful child.
 She’s prone to fits of screaming or crying.
 The emotion frightens the elders.
 It comes from her father, yes, but I can’t see how it will harm her.
 The humans seemed to live their lives fine, controlling it well enough.
 ~ I received a visit from my mother’s sister today.
 News of the child had reached her and she felt she needed to call on me, now that my mother was not here to guide me.
 I was in my room when she arrived.
 I heard the two quick raps and then one loud knock from her visits during my childhood and instantly knew it was her.
 “Aunt Junnie!” I gushed as she came in.

When she found herself at the edge of it, she veered right, seeing that it extended farther in that direction.
 She deliberately tried to lose herself, since that was how she'd gotten to 2011.
 And she knew that Rick would find her if she didn't get back to 1927.
 It wasn't working.
 She could tell--there wasn't enough fog to hide anything, and she could see that nothing had changed.
 She was still in 2011.
 "Rick!"
 She could hear him hurrying toward her, and she turned to meet him.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, hugging her close.
 Tears rolled down her cheeks, and she choked back a sob.

He stood back, seemingly a bystander as the words flowed from his barely moving lips.
 Then he ran.
 Confusion again as Junnie followed after him.
 Chased him.
 Ruby’s whip cracked in front of me and I knew the advance had gotten too far.
 And I was tied to a wall.
 Why hadn’t they killed me already?
 I waited for the flames.
 What came instead was far more excruciating.
 I expected to collapse as my body disconnected from my mind, but the vines held me in place.

The other half-orc remained at the door, his eyes not leaving the gray outside.
 “He’s not sending for us,” Harruq said.
 “You are correct,” said Velixar’s voice, startling both of them.
 They turned to see their master emerge from the shadows of their home, his red eyes gleaming.
 “How did you get in here?” the warrior asked.
 “Listen to me,” Velixar said, ignoring the question.
 “I have little time.
 The elves have erected barricades near their homes.
 Surely you have seen them.
 Slip past their defenses and wait.

It held a tone that let everyone simply know that a decision has been made.
 Imeralda seemed glued to the books, but Doi’van and Rodregas went to work on cleaning up the rest of the barn.
 They would not be able to do much more without getting some timber.
 They all worked or read until it was too dark and than they fell asleep quickly.
 The next morning, after they had finished Morning Prayer, Rodregas said, “Alright, are you two ready for a little fighting practice?” At their nod he added, “It is always good to start with the basics.
 I thought we would go over some fighting forms.
 Are you two familiar with learning forms, also known as Kata?” he asked.
 He was expecting Imeralda to shake her head but was a little surprised that Doi’van did as well.
 He clearly knew how to fight.
 Rodregas started to explain, “Forms are a series of motions that mock fighting, but also give you an opportunity to work on balance and to visualize and understand your actions and responses to different fighting situations.

I would hand him a bottle of water and tell him I would wait.
 He was never truly clean.
 When he slept, I went into the bedroom to see if his chest was inflating with air to assure me he was still alive.
 It reminded me of when our boys were babies and sometimes we would check on them in the night or as they napped and we never left the room until we verified they were breathing just because that is what a parent does.
 Chapter 15: Happy Frickin’ Holidays!
 As Thanksgiving approached, our traditions looked impossible to pull off.
 We were evasive when we called my wife’s parents to tell them not to come to our house as they usually did.
 We said we had some personal family issues to deal with.
 We could tell their feelings were hurt, but we didn’t feel we had any other choice.
 We did allow my younger brother Harry in on the whole awful situation and invited him to come to the house as planned.

When Cody was two months old, we moved to Arizona for a teaching job I was offered.
 Two years later, we moved to Chico, California for a job with more security, which we craved on account of the little ones.
 But security only exists as a craving.
 Even though the college in Chico gave me tenure, so they couldn’t have fired me unless I kidnapped the president or his wife or daughter, I had to leave it behind because Laura and I split apart and my kids, whom I loved more than life, health, art or anything, went to live in San Diego.
 I tried commuting (1000 mile weekend trips) for a while but, feeling what I imagine was a similar emptiness to that of Mexicans who labor up here for their families in Mexico, I chucked the best job I’ll probably ever have and returned to San Diego.
 In those first years back, the times I lived for were coaching Cody and the team during practices and ball games at Kuhlken Field, home of La Mesa National Little League.
 Named after my dad since he had been president and organized the renovation of the field.
 During our games, pulling for Cody, I came to understand why a father I knew dropped dead in the stands, when his heart failed while his son was pitching.
 As teenagers, my kids carried on the family tradition of abject rebellion, to the degree that I wrote a Reader story about the Tough Love group I was attending weekly.
 The year my kids began to climb out of the mud, I met Pam.

Therefore, we have proposed that the UN adopt a number of districts in different regions of the world, including crime-ridden inner cities or impoverished rural areas in industrial countries, to evolve and apply strategies for their rapid transition to a higher level of development.
 Six Goals in Education
 Once formulated, this knowledge needs to be imparted through education.
 Education is the greatest known civilizing force and the single most powerful lever for human development.
 Training imparts skills, but education increases the capacity of the individual at a more basic level, making the mind more active and alert, converting physical energy into mental energy, training us to see things from a wider perspective, to question and challenge the status quo, to think and imagine, to innovate and invent, to make decisions for ourselves and to act on our own initiative.
 Education is the process by which society passes on the accumulated knowledge and experience of countless centuries to new generations in a systematic, concentrated and abridged form, so that today’s young people can start their lives at the high point of knowledge and wisdom attained by preceding generations.
 Education replaces the slow, subconscious process of trial and error learning with a swift, conscious process.
 This accumulated knowledge is a great power that can be utilized to accelerate human development and abridge the time needed for society to arrive at progressively higher levels of material, social and psychological fulfilment.
 Despite the massive efforts of international institutions to create awareness of the vital role of education in peace, democracy, economic development, population control and environmental protection, progress on extending the benefits of education to all humankind is still grossly inadequate.
 In 1990, 948 million people or about 20 per cent of the entire world population lacked even basic literacy skills.

I'd thought it'd been breathtaking two weeks ago bathed in the light of the full moon.
 I'd been amazed at its lush beauty the couple of times I'd snuck back during the daylight.
 Neither of those compared to what greeted me now.
 Soft light came from dozens of floating lamps that'd been placed in the pool, all of which gave off an aching, white luminescence that seemed perfectly matched to the brilliant white of the rose petals scattered over the surface of the water.
 It wasn't until we got closer that I could make out the purple edging to the petals.
 "Lagrimas."
 Alec's voice was husky.
 "Nothing else would be appropriate.
 Not for you, not tonight."
 As we continued forward I was able to make out the other additions to the grotto.

If I thought that I weren't going home--"  Her voice caught.
 "I understand."
 Rick nuzzled her temple.
 "But now that you're not going to marry Davis, will you at least stop feeling guilty when we kiss?"
 She smiled.
 "I like your kisses."
 "I like yours too."
 He pressed his lips to hers.
 Marie nestled close to him, hoping he'd kiss her like he had last time.
 But then she hiccupped.

Hoping it would just go away or that he would grow out of it like I did didn’t seem likely.
 His grades were terrible, and he kept getting in trouble for being in the wrong place at the wrong time or with the wrong person.
 For instance, he was put on probation for being in a car with someone who was in possession of a replica firearm.
 He looked like total shit, and when we confronted him about it he was feeling bad enough that he confessed: He was addicted to the pain pill known as Oxy.
 He told us that he needed our help to get off of it.
 We never thought to find the reasoning behind the drug abuse, we just thought he had tried it and grew to feel dependent on it.
 He was always a tough kid to raise and he was often a handful and we felt this problem could be handled like any other.
 But we were novices when it came to helping someone kick drug addiction.
 We did our best to assist him and we attempted to detox him at home.
 We called Brandon’s real doctor (not the ones who prescribe marijuana) and asked for guidance.

He could feel their numbers dwindling in his mind, now but a third of what his glorious army had been.
 “This has gone on long enough,” he seethed.
 He outstretched his hands and shrieked words of magic.
 Qurrah staggered back, in awe of the power that came rolling forth.
 The fog of darkness swirled and recoiled at each word Velixar spoke.
 The cold on his flesh grew sharper as the blackness grew thicker.
 “Be gone from me!” Velixar cried, yanking down his arms.
 Six fingered hands ripped up from the black, some smaller than a child’s, some as large as houses.
 Each one lunged to the sky, clutching and grabbing at the elves that circled above.
 “Retreat!” one elf shouted, banking as black fingers tore through the air just before his mount.

The establishment of farm schools in villages, on land temporarily leased from local farmers, can combine the advantages of both formal training and demonstration on farmers' fields, with emphasis on economic viability and ecological sustainability.
 This is a low cost strategy that requires prior training of a large number of village level instructors, but little investment in infra structure.
 The schools can demonstrate the economic benefits of new and improved crops and cultivation practices, engaging local farmers as both students and staff, and covering most of the cost of training in the form of sale proceeds from the farm schools' production.
 7.Water conservation.
 The inefficient and negligent use of water in agriculture is one of the most serious barriers to a sustainable expansion of agricultural production.
 Public policy regarding the cost of water supplied by major irrigation projects and low-cost or free distribution of power for pumping underground water aggravate the problem.
 Technologically, the solutions to water depletion are largely in hand.
 What is needed is a massive effort in public education and demonstration, coupled with incentives to encourage their adoption.
 In monsoon regions it has been demonstrated that recharging underground aquifers by reverse pumping during rain-surplus seasons can restore ten years of water depletion in one rainy season.
 Proven methods are available and have been commercially applied with great success, as the achievements of Israel so dramatically demonstrate, radically to reduce water consumption by as much as five- to ten-fold, while at the same time significantly increasing crop yields.

This was the situation confronting the states of the region at the beginning of the transition period, and the reason why the actual results of the reform differed so drastically from what had been anticipated.
 The situation in Eastern and Central Europe was further complicated by the disproportionately large size and importance of the defence sector in the economy.
 This necessitates, not only a change from one economic system to another, but also a restructuring of the entire economy from a defence orientation to a consumer orientation.
 This change in structure could not be brought about by reliance on macro-economic policy.
 2.Political and social consensus is essential for rapid social change: In a democratic society, the market cannot be instituted by decrees or authoritarian methods which belong to the old sys tem.
 In the new political climate, reforms will be successful only in the measure that they are understood and accepted by the population.
 The vitality of the market depends on releasing the initiative of people to act in their own perceived best interests by producing and distributing goods and services for consumption by others.
 This initiative cannot be ordered, it can only be encouraged.
 Economic policy recommendations failed adequately to anticipate either the impact of the programme on the people or their reaction to it.
 In the early stages of reform, the public exhibited an incredible degree of patience, tolerance and endurance under conditions of growing hardship.

I was by far the oldest guy in the room.
 I was approached and asked for my license, which, of course I showed.
 I was given the grand tour and a detailed break down of how each different bud worked better for different symptoms.
 This one is for sleeplessness, this one for appetite stimulation, this one for back pain, and this one—believe it or not— is for asthma.
 It was absurd.
 I know there are people out there who claim they need this drug, but those people were not my son or half of the high school, nor did anyone at this dispensary seem to be suffering from anything but red squinty eyes.
 But, we thought, at least our son is only smoking legal pot.
 I did it, and I’m okay.
 As time went on Brandon was showing signs that he was faltering.
 I busted him again.

But Rick had refused every time.
 She hoped that getting him to commit to the benefit dance would at least force him to ask someone out.
 She knew he was lonely, and she couldn’t stand seeing him shut himself off from any prospect of a relationship.
 Rick would probably have refused to go if he hadn’t met Sharon this weekend.
 He didn’t feel particularly attracted to her, but she was a nice girl, and that was a big improvement over his last few experiences.
 That evening he went out to the garden with the book Teri had given him.
 Sharon had been enthusiastic about the dance when he’d called to invite her.
 He’d told her he’d lend her the book, but she said that she already had some ideas about finding a drop-waist dress and a cloche hat.
 Personally, he thought the clothes were rather ugly.
 The dresses were shapeless, and the men’s pants were baggy.

I just kept putting one foot in front of the other.
 I couldn’t even imagine what lay in the mountains where I was heading, but there was no going back.
 I wasn’t tired anymore, not as I had been every day since I’d been using magic.
 But I forced those thoughts away, counting steps as I ran.
 I was miles from home.
 A home I might never return to.
 I pushed myself forward through the day, only stopping when I found a patch of sweet berries and a small, babbling creek.
 The berries were wild, small and much less palatable without the guiding hand of an elf, but the water I’d gathered from the stream was cool and refreshing.
 As evening approached, so grew the underlying discomfort with the idea of the coming darkness.
 Not that I hadn’t spent my share of time alone at home, just not alone in the middle of a strange forest outside.

The wind created by our passage was strong enough to make my eyes tear up, but I resisted the urge to close them.
 I occasionally saw shadowy shapes darting through the trees ahead or to either side of us, but there wasn't any way to be sure it was Isaac and Jasmin instead of Brandon and his entire pack.
 A faint howl from behind us caused Alec to put on another terrifying burst of speed as we left the lane and turned to parallel the road.
 The sight of branches clawing at us as we slipped by them with little more than inches to spare was too much.
 I finally closed my eyes and ducked down as close to Alec's neck as I could get.
 With one less sense distracting me, the rest of them kicked into high gear.
 I could feel every step, including the occasional slide as the rough gravel we were running on wasn't up to bearing our combined weight without slipping.
 The bitter taste of fear along the back of my tongue was surprisingly strong, but even so I found my thoughts dwelling on the sheer pleasure of having my arms wrapped around Alec's rock-hard upper body.
 The high-pitched scream of a performance engine pulled me away from my absurd musings.
 James' blue and white Accord passed us doing the better part of twice the legal speed limit, and then flipped around with the distinctive squeal of overworked tires.

I had no idea who this was and I probably shouldn’t let on who I was.
 He noticed my open mouth, blank expression, and sat again, eyeing me questioningly, all humor gone.
 “You seem to be really good at magic,” I offered.
 He chuckled.
 “Is that so?” “Yes, well, I… I need to learn.” “Learn?” The humor was gone again.
 “What do you mean learn?” “I’ve never, well, except for fire, and I need someone to teach me… and you’re…” I waved a hand in his direction.
 His brow rose.
 “I don’t understand,” he said, clearly concerned about my mental state.
 Maybe I was a few nuts short of a bushel.

Once we stopped, I slid down Alec's back and looked around.
 The tiny cabin set back into the rocks before us blended into the hillside so well, I probably wouldn't have noticed it if Alec hadn't stopped so close.
 As soon as he was confident I could stand unaided, Alec gave me a reassuring smile, and then knocked gently on the door.
 The woman who appeared a few seconds later seemed frail in a way that somehow wasn't attributable to her graying hair, or slender frame.
 It wasn't until she released Alec from a hug, and slowly moved back into the cabin, that I realized it was how she moved that made her seem so old.
 Her motions reminded me of how my grandfather had moved the last few years before he'd died.
 Slowly, and with extra care, as if a careless action would leave him crumpled on the floor, racked with pain.
 "Mallory, I'd like to introduce you to Adriana Paige.
 Adriana, Mallory."
 I smiled, and gingerly offered my hand to her, which she clasped in both of hers.

A pale hand grabbed Dieredon’s throat, its grip iron and its flesh ice.
 “It will be painful,” Velixar said.
 Vile magic swirled about his hand, pouring into Dieredon’s neck.
 The blood in his veins clotted and thickened.
 A toss of his hand and the elf flew through the air.
 He rolled across the ground without the usual grace he had shown in combat.
 Qurrah glanced about, paralyzed with fear.
 The remaining elves were returning, deadly and furious, and the darkness that had protected them was gone.
 “Do you feel it?” Velixar said, stalking over to the dying elf.
 “The blood in your throat is clotting.

It’s too early in the day for her to have been drinking.
 (To Eugene)
 Liz – How long has that been going on?
 Eugene – What?
 Liz – My mother hitting on you.
 Eugene – She hasn’t been hitting on me.
 Liz – Then what do you call it?
 Eugene – Uh, noticing my natural good looks and complementing me in a positive manner about them.
 Liz – (Frowning) How long has it been going on?
 Eugene – I dunno…

I started to share her grin, but before I could, Chevelle was in front of us, his horse blocking my way.
 I was almost thrown from my saddle when we stopped to avoid running into him.
 He was angry again.
 “Frey.” “What?” “Do you remember the last time you used a spell?” I recalled the smell of burning flesh as the maps cut into my palms.
 “Yes,” I muttered, defeated.
 The look he gave Ruby was clear.
 There would be no magic study for me.
 But I did know she had it.
 Maybe I’ll be able to steal it… Lost in thought, I began to fall behind the group.
 The higher we rose up the mountain, the more treacherous the jagged rock became.

Large gray rocks dotted the landscape.
 There was a haziness on the horizon but as we rode it began to clear, revealing a mammoth lake ahead.
 It was a hundred times bigger than the tiny forest ponds I was used to, as smooth as glass.
 Behind it the haze thinned just enough I could see the outline of mountains.
 The image was like a punch in the chest.
 Chevelle rode up beside us.
 “The hills of Camber.” I looked at him, my watcher, and thought his features were peaceful for the first time.
 Junnie had said he was from the North, and I wondered if this was his home.
 Maybe that was why he’d truly brought me here, a much-needed vacation from the duties of council, the task of being a watcher.
 They’d never know, as long as he got me back soon.

He swallowed.
 "Very much."
 Pleased, she returned to the dressing room, feeling better about the bathing suit.
 Rick found a chair and dropped into it.

 But there was more to her beauty than that incredible face and body.
 She was .

It was 11:25.
 It had been 7:45 when they'd come into the garden.
 She was gone.
 CHAPTER THIRTEEN
 Tears were streaming down Marie's cheeks when the fog began to lift.
 She was in her own garden.
 She ran to her house, tearing open the door and dashing upstairs.
 She paused at her room long enough to toss her bag onto her bed and then dashed to her parents' room.
 "Mother!

Rachel and Brandon, both of who seemed to dislike the other, and neither of whom I was really sure I could count on.
 It was fine to only have two friends, or even just one friend if you knew they would do everything they possibly could to make sure they wouldn't let you down.
 It was entirely different when you weren't sure you could trust the people around you.
 Brandon was too good to be true.
 I pretty much expected any day now he'd come to his senses and realize he could do a lot better.
 Right or not, it's hard to really become emotionally invested when you feel like that.
 Rachel on the other hand should have been the perfect friend, but I got the feeling she'd always choose her brother over me.
 I felt guilty for holding that against her, family should be important.
 Cindi's friends back in Minnesota had probably felt similarly, but I'd always been really careful not to make her choose between me and them.
 Alec seemed like the type who'd force a decision just because he could.

I just want to get this over with.
 Don’t even know why I’m telling you this.”
 “Because you must,” she said, a bit of her stubbornness returning.
 “Because I need to know.”
 The half-orc nodded.
 He began his story.
 “The only money I ever made was working for the king,” Harruq said.
 “This was after the orcs attacked Veldaren about a year ago and busted up the walls.
 They were hiring everybody to help rebuild and I was just as strong then as I am now.
 They weren’t paying much, but you got to remember we were stealing food to live.

 Liz – Jim, you need to seek help.
 Jim – Probably, but I won’t.
 Art – Excuse me Liz, but have you seen Jim about here?
 Jim – (In a silly accent) No sir, there has been nobody named Jim here.
 Art – Son, those glasses suit you, they hide that ugly mug of yours quite well.
 Jim – Since these are your glasses it must be an inherited family curse to be so homely.
 Art – My boy, indeed it is, and if the world is lucky you won’t ever have children and pass on our cursed genes.
 Jim – What about Johnny?
 Can he still breed?

 Qurrah nodded, then closed his eyes and rehearsed the spells he knew.
 They were weak compared to his master’s but they would claim a few lives.
 His whip curled around his arm, ready for more bloodshed.
 The white dots in the distance grew at a frightening rate.
 “Such speed,” Qurrah said.
 “How?”

"I'm sorry, darling."
 She kissed Marie's forehead and left.
 Marie curled up next to Rick's t-shirt still clutching his handkerchief.
 She felt so empty.
 She didn't sleep well that night but woke up early nevertheless.
 After bathing, she put on her emerald underwear and a simple white dress and went out into the garden.
 It didn't look so different from Rick's, she decided.
 They didn't have any white roses like he did, nor an electric fountain, but they had red roses and azaleas, just as he did.
 She wished she'd brought back a picture of him.
 But a picture wouldn't help much, she knew.

A flick of my fingers and light flooded the tiny space.
 I took a quick inventory: the seal on my wardrobe was intact, my drawings were still scattered across the floor, and the stash of cheese remained on the table beside my bed.
 My mother’s pendant hung from a woven leather chain above my pillow, shooting refracted beams across the bed, and I smiled as I sat beneath it.
 Scanning the pages I’d brought home from the library, I tried to find some order.
 I hadn’t even considered there might be missing pages, but I sorted what I had as best I could onto the worn comforter.
 I sat rigid while reading through, unable to fathom why it had me so anxious.
 The first pages contained a detailed description of the writer, including his lineages and how he’d come upon the information.
 He was apparently a record-keeper for Grand Council and was responsible for copying scrolls and adding new information for each of the northern clans from their various local libraries.
 Some of the information was sketchy: gossip from the neighboring fairy guild about strange activities and reports from travelers about deserted villages.
 Or maybe not deserted.

“It’s just sad.” I was about to say something else when the dwarf gave a loud cough.
 Jason and Seth fell silent, outlined by the eerie glow of the arch.
 “You must know a few things before you enter,” the dwarf said, pacing back and forth.
 He reminded me of a teacher instructing a class.
 “First of all, once you enter, there is a chance that you won’t be able to leave for a while.” My heart fell at this.
 “Second, Igneeria is wild and offers little protection.
 Especially at a time like this.” He gave us a hard stare.
 “You might get seriously injured, or you might almost die.
 You must be ready for this.” I felt my stomach do sick flip-flops.
 I wasn’t ready.

Rodregas had gotten too comfortable with his opponents not being able to match his strength.
 This guard did.
 The Immortal Guard had already launched himself forward and Rodregas’ own speed worked against him.
 As Rodregas’ short sword hit nothing but air, he felt the sharp agony of the guard’s blade piercing his thigh.
 Rodregas used his speed to throw himself back.
 But as he did, he felt another sharp cut hit his upper arm.
 The other men were moving in now that he was off balance.
 Rodregas twisted as he fell and grabbed one of the slavers and brought him down.
 With a quick stab into his groin, Rodregas took the slaver out of commission.
 Rodregas rolled off his squirming body and threw himself up to a standing position.

M. S. Swaminathan, Chairman International Commission on Peace and Food Madras, India, 6 July 1994
 Preface to the Second Edition Unprecedented Opportunity, Unfinished Agenda
 Humanity is on the threshold of unprecedented opportunities to promote peace and accelerate human development.
 Yet, as in the past, our vision of these opportunities is obstructed by conceptions and attitudes inherited from a bygone era.
 To fully appreciate the emerging opportunities, we need to more clearly comprehend the events of the past two decades that are the seeds from which these opportunities spring.
 Restructuring the UN
 The formation of the International Commission on Peace & Food was conceived in 1987, a time when mutual suspicions, escalating military expenditure and confrontational Cold War rhetoric blinded the world to the possibility of radically transforming the global security environment.
 Yet, fuelled by the bold initiatives of Mikhail Gorbachev, by the time ICPF conducted its first meeting on the border of the rapidly vanishing Iron Curtain at Trieste in September 1989, the Berlin Wall had fallen, Cold War hostilities had melted, and the prospect of ushering in a more peaceful and prosperous world for all seemed within reach.
 The euphoria of those heady days generated high expectations of a peace dividend that would help to wipe away much of the world’s suffering.
 At the same time, the withdrawal of the confrontation between East and West resulted in a gradual shift of attention from the threat of imminent global self-destruction to lesser but very real problems, among them – the unresolved danger arising from huge stockpiles of nuclear weapons; some 26 on-going localized military conflicts within and between developing nations, aggravated by increased trafficking in small armaments; the persistence of hunger and malnutrition, especially among the poorest populations of South Asia and politically unstable regions of Africa; progressively rising levels of unemployment in both industrialized and developing countries; and the turbulence and hardship of political, economic and social transition in post-Communist Eastern Europe.

 Gene – Here it comes, I couldn’t have just taken the sack and gone.
 Jim – Nope you couldn’t, which could give us the valuable time we need to come up with other stupid questions.
 Liz – Like where you picked up the Japanese?
 Jim – And if the tourists paid in Dollars or Yen.

 Qurrah lurched awake, gasping for air.
 His throat ached, and he could feel the tiniest trickle of blood down his trachea.

“I’m not like the others.”
 “That so?” Alvrik’s face hadn’t changed in the slightest.
 “Tell me why.”
 “Stronger,” he said.
 “Tougher.
 Whatever work you got two men doing, I can do alone.
 Whatever hours you got them working, I can do double.”
 “A large boast,” Alvrik said.
 He took the bone out of his mouth and pointed at Harruq’s ears.
 “You got orc blood in you.”

I finished processing everything about the time Alec turned and walked back.
 I opened my mouth to protest, but he shook his head at me as we all fell into formation around him.
 From what little I knew about Alec's pack, it wasn't uncommon for them to spend time together without the kind of chest-beating byplay that was so much a part of Brandon's group, but our lunch table was even more subdued than I'd expected.
 Faced with an almost complete lack of conversation, I didn't have the courage to ask some of the questions on my mind.
 It wasn't until I'd followed Isaac to my history class that I finally worked up the nerve to find out more of what was going on.
 Once the substitute had called roll, and then more or less turned the class loose for a 'group study session', I turned to Isaac and whispered my first question.
 "This fight between Alec and Brandon, it's for real?
 I mean they aren't just going to fight until first blood, are they?"
 Isaac's nod was hesitant, like he knew I was headed towards things he wasn't supposed to tell me.
 "I'm afraid the contest is quite serious, but still nothing for you to worry about."

In recognition of the mutual suspicions between Russia and the Western powers, the rule of unanimity usually adopted by political conferences was applied to decisions made by the five major powers that became the permanent members of the Security Council.
 The rest of the world was poorly represented.
 Only 51 nations – including only two African states, two East Asian nations and three Soviet republics – out of the current total of 184 UN members were present at its founding.
 This structure is based on political realities that no longer hold true.
 As the limitations of the League led to renewed conflagration two decades later, so the arrangements underlying the establishment of the UN contained within them the seeds of the confrontation between the superpowers and the Cold War.
 The present international system of governance is as far from being truly representative and ‘democratic’ as many erstwhile authoritarian governments that incorporated the popular adjective in the names of their parties or states.
 The UN Charter assigns primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security to the Security Council of 15 members, of whom five are permanent members with veto power over all matters.
 In no other constitution or organization founded on democratic principles is it accepted that a few members may thus invalidate the decisions of the majority.
 The General Assembly, in which all members are represented and which is headed by an elected Secretary, is only an advisory body, constituted to ‘discuss any questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security’ and to ‘make recommendations with regard to any such questions to the state or states concerned or to the Security Council or both’.
 This authorization is restricted by the provision that in regard to any dispute or situation in which the Security Council is exercising its functions under the Charter, the General Assembly will not make any recommendations with regard to the dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.

His thoughts, dreams, and nightmares are available to me, hidden behind locked doors to which I now hold the key.”
 Again, Qurrah lusted for such power and control.
 Velixar smiled, clearly seeing the desire the half-orc hid behind his eyes.
 “One day you will hold such control.
 For now, be content with what I have taught you.”
 Qurrah gave a soft laugh and then nodded.
 “I believe that shall suffice.”
 Harruq did not know why, but the short exchange sent chills running to the pit of his stomach.

Under normal circumstances we'd be able to determine whether or not they'd been here in the last few days, but the rainstorm last night was strong enough to wash away all of that."
 Alec waited patiently as I tried to get a grip on myself.
 As soon as I nodded he disappeared through the door.
 A few seconds later he was back.
 "It's safe; there's no trace of them."
 He held the door open for me, and then slipped outside.
 "You need to erase any evidence that you weren't here all night.
 Take a shower, change into some of your own clothes, and then go to sleep.
 We'll keep watch outside until your mom gets back."
 I opened my mouth to ask what would happen after that, but he was already gone, moving so quickly through the darkness that I wasn't even sure which direction he'd headed.

The two bodies collapsed, their lifeless limbs entangled.
 Not far ahead of them, a woman ran in only her shift, a child clutched to her breast.
 “Why do you flee?” Harruq roared when her crying eyes glanced back at him.
 “This life is pain, suffering!
 I’m here to end it, end it all!”
 The woman ran faster and her child cried louder.
 It didn’t matter.
 Harruq rammed her with his shoulder.
 To protect her child, the woman rolled so that her side took the brunt of the fall.
 As the half-orc’s blades twirled in the air, the mother kissed her child one last time before curling up around the joy of her life.

He flinched a little, like maybe my aim had been a little too true.
 He looked for a moment like he was going to say something, but then his phone started vibrating again, and he simply nodded as he turned and walked away, moving much faster by himself than he did when I was with him.
 As I stared at the empty space where he'd been standing just a second before, I felt my chest start to constrict, and my breathing speed up.
 The sense of terror racing along my synapses was completely irrational, and extraordinarily powerful.
 Just as the room began to spin crazily around me, I felt a gentle touch on my shoulder.
 "Mistress Paige, is there anything I can get you?
 Something to eat perhaps?
 Or if you'd rather, I can show you to the theater."
 I chopped off a hysterical burst of laughter just before it managed to emerge full force and totally embarrass me.
 Of course Alec had a theater in his house.

The only girls were hanging on their boyfriends.
 So we left.
 In the Chevy, Cliff said, “Tijuana?” “Sure,” I said.
 “Why not?” On Avenida Revolución, even when nothing was happening, you knew any second most anything could.
 Police could falsely charge you with some offense, so you would pay them to let you go.
 A drug dealer could shoot another, right beside you on the sidewalk.
 A gang of gringo sailors might pick a brawl with a gang of locals.
 A drunken homecoming queen could fall into your lap and coo about how much cuter you are than her boyfriend who has gone to puke in the alley.
 We chose one of the quieter nightclubs.
 Still, it was crowded, so we shared a table with two friendly Marines.

Tears sparkled in her eyes.
 "I'm sorry."
 "I know."
 He kissed her then, slowly, sweetly, longingly, trying to memorize the taste and feel of her mouth.
 He wanted to deepen the kiss, to evoke the passion he knew only too well that she was capable of, but such a kiss would be torture for both of them.
 Marie at last ended the kiss.
 She gazed up into his eyes for a moment.
 "I love you, Rick."
 "I love you too, sweetheart."
 Slowly she backed out of his arms.

“Perhaps, or perhaps the elves are retreating, or even the humans.
 Either way, our time is running short.
 We must find our master.
 So far no resident of Woodhaven has seen us and lived, but I do not wish to press such luck.”
 “Looks like we have no choice,” Harruq said, crossing his swords in an ‘X’ before his chest.
 Far down the street, where the road hooked left like the back leg of a dog, an elven archer approached, his bow ready.
 Two arrows flew into the air.
 Both half-orcs dodged as the arrows whistled past.
 “Close the distance,” Qurrah said before beginning a spell.
 Harruq charged, bellowing a mindless war cry.

 Art – Why haven’t you been helping out?
 Jim – Um, because there were already a bunch of people.
 And you didn’t need any more to get in the way.
 Besides, I wanted to catch up with Sumo here.
 Art – That stupid comic book still…
 Jim – Well yeah, I don’t know anyone in the real world named Sumo.

At least that was all I could assume.
 I woke up flustered, with vague memories of Alec.
 My best guess was that I was trying to defend myself after having argued with his little sister.
 If I was going to waste my time in the vivid dreams, it would've made more sense to spend them trying to explain my side of what'd happened to Rachel, but apparently I wasn't normal enough for that.
 I'd been all set to swallow my pride and thank Alec for shutting up the two kids sitting behind me.
 Only that'd been before the ride home all by myself on the bus while he sped home in his little luxury car.
 Maybe I'd still have apologized to him if he'd been in school on Monday.
 Instead, he'd skipped the entire first half of the week, and by the time I did finally see him, I'd backed myself so far into a corner, I couldn't even meet his eyes during class.
 Somehow I'd managed to make it through day after day of isolation.
 Brandon's friends continued to more or less ignore me, the boys without the trace of spite that I picked up from most of the girls.

The other guard charged Qurrah and swung his longsword.
 The necromancer smirked, preparing another lashing.
 The flaming leather wrapped around the guard’s sword hand, charring flesh to bone as he screamed.
 The blade dropped as the guard held his blackened hand before him, bits of white bone catching the moonlight.
 “Mercy,” he begged, falling to his knees as the necromancer approached.
 “There is no such thing,” Qurrah said before magically hurling two pieces of bone through the man’s eyes.
 He turned to the other guard, who still gasped in vain for air.
 He watched until death claimed him.

“Actually the topic did come up,” said Doi’van with a chuckle like rocks in a land slide.
 “While guards are usually not allowed in, it is not unusual for close friends or advisors to go in with some of those of the blood; to share their wisdom on the best possible greater sigils to take on.” “I will assume,” said Rodregas, “that they had never heard of a Nymph entering the chamber, much less one of the Hellborn?” “AElves are not uncommon and actually more Orqui than I expected.
 One servant thought that Nymphs used to go in during his father’s, father’s time, but not any time recently.
 No one could even imagine a Hellborn going into the Chamber,” agreed Doi’van.
 “Well as far behind as we are, we might not even get the chance to try to bully our way in,” Rodregas said.
 Doi’van nodded and that comment seemed to end the conversation.
 As Rodregas headed out to the sands of the Cathedral arena for the jousting match, he was relieved to see Imeralda waiting at the entrance to talk to him.
 She had been out all night on her mission.
 “Well, I have to say I am very tired of talking so I will make this quick,” she said with her normal sunny smile.
 Rodregas had to admit she did look tired.

When she was done, he took her to a jewelry store, thinking she might like that, but there was jewelry in 1927.
 She was much more interested in the electronic gadgets next door, and she spent ten minutes exclaiming over the effects of a blacklight.
 When he bought her one, her face came alive with delight.
 "It'll make your rug glow!"
 "Just what I always wanted: fluorescent purple carpet."
 But he grinned as he took the bag from the cashier.
 "Thank you so much, Rick," she said, beaming up at him.
 "I think you're more excited about the blacklight than the clothes."
 "I love the clothes--they're beautiful.

That’s why I didn’t say anything.” “I still don’t care, Seth.” I said.
 He made a face, “Jazell I really don’t know if I should say anything…” I interrupted him again, “Seth just give up trying to talk me into not listening.
 It’s a waste of breath.” I took my own stick and threw it at him.
 He ducked, of course, and it landed on the ground.
 “What if whatever you’re not telling us happens and we never knew?
 How would that help anyone?” He looked down and mumbled something that sounded like, “You couldn’t help.” When he looked back up he said, “Fine you win, I’ll tell you.” He didn’t sound happy about it.
 “I’m waiting.” “You know, when Emily asked for any warnings that we were given?” “Yeah.” I had a bad feeling where this was going.
 “I lied.” I blinked in amazement.
 “You lied to Emily?

I'd have to make sure they never met.
 I took the opportunity to look a little more closely at the girl.
 Seen from profile, she wasn't quite as pretty as I'd thought originally.
 She wasn't exactly plain-looking, but her features weren't very remarkable.
 She did have incredibly soft-looking wavy brown hair though.
 It looked like debate boy had pretty much finished answering her question.
 I looked back down at my book so I wouldn't get caught staring.
 I was just about to dive back into my text book when someone cleared their throat nearby.
 The tutor was standing at my elbow looking over my assignment.

No one really used the ciphers, you didn’t need them with magic, but they had been added to many of the pages when the fairies had started tracking clan histories.
 I was holding in my hand the information I needed to find the northern clans in the Council’s library.
 My stomach tightened, but I found myself getting up and heading toward the village, regardless of the consequence.
 I argued with that impulsive part of me the entire way to town.
 I shouldn’t do it.
 I couldn’t.
 But I was.
 I was going to do it.
 And if I got caught?
 I could claim ignorance.

Faith is just a crutch to lean upon.
 A way to convince yourself that there is some reason for all the pain and humiliation.
 Rather than grasping reality and actually doing something to help the world, people with faith just wait for luck to see them through.
 Ned – What is it we need then?
 Art – All people need is love and happiness.
 That’s it.
 Some happiness you can find on your own, without love.
 Some of the best kind of happiness comes from love.
 Not the distant love of a remote God, but a personal love.
 Love of other people, or love of life.

“At last!” Felewen cried, staring out from a side alley.
 They were behind a group of ten soldiers battling a pair of elven warriors who stood back to back.
 “Make haste, they need us!”
 Felewen charged, desperate to arrive before her brethren were overwhelmed.
 Aurelia stepped into the street and summoned her magic.
 Frost surrounded her hands, and a thin sheet of ice spread beneath the human soldiers.
 Many of them stumbled, unable to balance the sword and shield in their hands and the heavy chainmail on their bodies.
 Felewen slid on one leg, her sword out and ready.
 She passed right between two men, slicing out heels and tendons as she flew by.
 The elf reached the end of the ice, turned, and went sliding back.

I was resigned now, the fury gone, and so was the screeching, the pain.
 They had said the binding was dangerous… There was a collective gasp as they realized I was back.
 I heard someone beside me and a flash of anger swept through me, lighting a flame at whoever it was.
 So maybe the fury wasn’t completely gone.
 I suddenly remembered the pages I had burnt in the briar patch so long ago.
 Burnt before I’d read them.
 My eyes flashed open.
 I sat up, ignoring my spinning head, but the book was already gone.
 I glared at Chevelle.
 It must have been dreadful, because he nodded and backed away, his mouth tight.

Any little shithead can get a “medical” license to smoke marijuana in California when he turns 18.
 In fact, it’s a rite of passage, even more than a drivers’ license nowadays.
 The students hand around a list of unscrupulous doctors who are willing to do a consultation for a fee and then write a prescription for a fee so your child can go to some legal dope dispensary and buy all the “sticky-icky green bud” he or she wants.
 They don’t need a parent to sign, they just need to recite from a passed-around list of symptoms as to why they need this marijuana when they show up to this farce of a doctor’s appointment.
 Apparently half of the high school has obtained this license to smoke pot and can buy the strongest pot available, legally.
 I went and got one for myself—as an experiment—and was astonished at how easy it was.
 In the waiting room at the doctor’s office I had thirty years on every single person.
 I also felt like I must have been the only one gainfully employed, well-groomed, thoughtfully dressed.
 It was an insane experience.
 This law has been sold to voters by showing cancer patients and other sick people who need this drug to ease symptoms, but the teenagers of the state have exploited this, now that it is law.

Are you one of the elves that were there way back then?”
 She gave him a wink.
 “No, but my father was.

 In elven terms, I am but a child.”
 “How old a child?” he prodded.
 “Seventy.”
 “ _Seventy?_ ”
 The elf laughed.

“Well,” Rodregas said, “I don’t think we are going to have any options for sigils for now.
 Let us continue to learn what we can of battle and of magic.
 If we are lucky we can worry about more if we survive our first strike at the Immortalists.” The next morning, during his meditation, Rodregas realized that it was time for action.
 He realized that if they continued simply to hide out in the farmhouse, winter would come and travel would be much more difficult.
 As he knelt on the ground examining the new color of the trees, he knew that it was now time to strike.
 CHAPTER 9 INTO THE FIRES
 Six days later the three of them found themselves ready to cross the Old Princess Road.

 As a half Forest Nymph she seemed to be able to disappear into the forest.
 Rodregas quickly learned how she had been able to track him from Raven Keep.

"Can we go to the library now?"
 If this wasn't her home, she was going to find a way to get back.
 CHAPTER FOUR
 Marie sat beside Rick at the library, watching in amazement as titles of books and magazines appeared on a screen in front of him.
 Whenever he found something that he thought could help them, a machine in front of her would print the title and its number on a piece of paper.
 She'd thought it would take hours and hours to find a handful of books.
 But in only 45 minutes Rick had a long list of books and articles.
 He filled out request forms for the articles and led her into more rows of books than she'd ever seen.
 He pulled out book after book, stacking them in her arms.
 When both had as many as they could carry, they went to check them out.

 Jim – That would be funny, if it wasn’t so blatantly suicidal.
 I can almost see smoke coming out of Johnny’s ears.
 Liz – Do you think he would believe it?
 Jim – Not for a second.
 Liz – But you think he would still be angry?
 Jim – Very.

Cowering in a corner was never a good strategy as the crowd only pushed you back to the center.
 The room erupted when the action was good and the fights were a scrappy version of actual boxing.
 The fight was over when you surrendered or you were knocked out.
 I fought many times and I do not remember ever losing.
 As I said, I had grown up facing a much tougher opponent than anyone in the room.
 I was rarely injured because I had learned to protect myself from the powerful blows of my stepfather and I knew how to look for an opening and drop my opponent.
 By this time I was close to six feet tall and about 175 pounds.
 I was in great shape and I had endured physical punishment as training.
 Drag racing wasn’t easy on a car, and since we were constantly racing, constantly striving to make the Chevelle faster, inevitably something was always broken.
 Hitchhiking to and from work became a regular event, and I often got rides from the same people every afternoon.

 "You've joined Father's company?"
 "Yes.

 Not at the bottom, because I do have a good deal of experience, but not at the top either.

Members share the conviction that a candid and challenging discussion of these issues is more valuable than representation of a consensus view.
 The Next Millennium
 We are on the threshold of a new millennium.
 All civilizations have recognized the special significance of new beginnings – the dawn of a new day, a new year, a new century.
 These are moments of new birth when fresh vision and greater energy are available for setting out in a new direction or accelerating progress along our chosen course.
 The dawn of a new millennium brings with it a tremendous power for renewal and advancement.
 It can mark a decisive transition or staging ground for speeding humanity’s evolutionary progression.
 The remarkable events of the past few years – the fall of the Berlin Wall, the turn to democracy in the former USSR and other countries of Eastern Europe, the peaceful end of apartheid in South Africa, and concrete steps toward lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians – confirm this truth.
 In an age of incredibly rapid and revolutionary change, who can confidently claim the wisdom to predict what can or cannot be accomplished in the coming decade?
 Looking back on this moment ten years from now, we may well be able to chronicle what now appear as equally extraordinary achievements.

I all but skipped out of the classroom.
 Later I'd probably complain about how small it was and wish I had enough to go shoe shopping, but for now it was just nice to know I had some discretionary money.
 Brandon looked up as I walked into the cafeteria, and waved me over.
 As I threaded between a pair of closely-set tables I noticed that Alec's table seemed unusually unsettled.
 If a shouting match could be conducted in whispers, it was being done by Jasmin and James, neither of who looked like they were happy about whatever was being discussed.
 Alec wasn't talking, but from the way he was scanning the room, he didn't want to be there anymore than the rest of them.
 I made it to Brandon's table, and was still pulling my meal replacement drink out of my bag when the loudspeaker clicked on with the obligatory burst of static.

"It was my fault so I'll be your ride back and forth from school every day."
 "I don't know about all of that, but thanks for the lift just now."
 I fumbled for a minute with the unfamiliar latch, and then invited the blistering heat into the cool interior of the car as I swung the door open.
 Brandon gently captured my arm before I could slide out of the passenger seat.
 "You'll wait for me tomorrow?"
 "I don't know--maybe.
 Anyone that thinks Minnesota is the east instead of the Midwest can't really be relied upon to remember important things like appointments."
 I could feel myself blushing again as I pulled free and fled into the house with a single wave goodbye.
 Normally I wasn't flirtatious.
 Heck, I hardly knew the meaning of the word, but something about Brandon turned it all into a harmless game.

Rachel's words calmed me a little at the same time they sparked confusion.
 I'd never heard her be quite so cynical.
 It was completely at odds with the innocent, accepting exterior she usually displayed.
 My surprise must have leaked through.
 Almost as soon the thought crossed my mind Rachel's demeanor crossed back from the older, jaded visage, to one that was more youthful, even embarrassed.
 "Sorry, I know she's your friend.
 I shouldn't say things like that, but that's really what she's doing.
 By the time the actual dance arrives, everyone who is anyone will have a date, most of them picked out by the girl weeks before the boy even started thinking about the dance."
 There wasn't really any bitterness in her voice, but there was something, maybe the same kind of longing I felt when I talked about Prom.
 "You're probably right.

Just close your eyes if you get scared."
 But she was fascinated, not scared.
 The cart made to resemble a bicycle took them through the air above a moonlit village, and she squeezed Rick's hand in delight rather than fear.
 She enjoyed it so much that they got back in line and rode again.
 But as much as she enjoyed the "E.T."
 ride, it couldn't compare to the "Back to the Future" ride.
 That was really like flying--even more than in the airplane.
 It was more like having wings of her own, soaring high and low, below bridges and over mountains.
 "We really never left the ground?"
 she asked Rick as they waited to ride it a second time.

 Maybe he wasn't feeling well.

 Jim – Sweet my poster.
 This is going where the old Legend of Zelda poster used to be in my room.
 I think I’ll frame it.
 Liz – What an honor.
 Jim – This painting deserves such an honor.
 You even got the Elvis’ hair perfect.

She patted my hand as she shrugged.
 "It's rather ironic how things work out sometimes, but that's not fair on my part.
 I'm sure there are things you would much rather learn of than how I came to be in my present circumstances."
 "Actually, that's part of what I want to understand.
 I mean I didn't come here wanting to learn your story specifically, but there's so much history I don't know.
 There's this shared past that I'm not a part of.
 It's like, oh, I don't know, I think maybe learning about the past will help me understand what's going on right now."
 Mallory's sigh seemed to allude to every one of her presumably substantial years.
 "How very perceptive.
 The past is very much driving what's happening right now, but so much of the past is tied up with the very things from which Alec's trying to protect you."

One day I woke up and I felt pretty good, you know.
 The sun was coming in the window there and I was digging the way the dust motes floated in it, as if they were little living things, and I thought, I’ve had enough of this shit.
 And I got dressed.
 Lor came in that morning and I was sitting there in my clothes waiting for her.
 We checked me out.
 We went down to the nurse’s station and said, room 1324 checking out.
 (laughs)  It’s funny now.
 But, then, it was like we were doing something extraordinary and perhaps not entirely wholesome.
 We drove home in compete silence.
 And when we got home, we undressed as if it were all scripted, as if this was the end of that chapter.

An enormous half-orc in black armor followed, soaked in blood and roaring in mindless fury.
 He spotted Antonil’s attacker, screamed an incomprehensible challenge, and then charged.
 The elf fired another arrow but was horrified to see it sail high.
 Behind him, Antonil delivered another kick, this time aiming for the elf’s knee instead of his bow.
 The elf had to dodge the kick, and that dodge was all it took.
 The half-orc swung his glowing black blades, cutting his bow, and his body, in twain.
 As the blood poured free, he roared, looked about, and then ran off toward the sound of combat.
 A frail form in rags followed from inside the house, a mirror image in looks but for the paler skin and lack of muscle.
 “You saw nothing,” this second half-orc said to him before following the warrior.
 Antonil struggled to his feet, shaking his head all the while.

And that, of course, had been the biggest oddity of all.
 Still, she had come 84 years into the future, and the parts about her husband and children had disappeared.
 He'd been sure that the pages had changed because her 84-year trip would affect the choices she was to make in 1927, so it made sense, now that she'd gone back to 1927, that those pages would change again to include the name of her husband or at least something about her adult life.
 Shaking his head, he put the papers back.
 He'd never know what had happened to her.
 Maybe, eventually, not knowing-- Rick staggered, everything suddenly going black.
 Gasping, he gripped the edge of the desk and then turned to jerk the drawer open again and grab the papers.
 Nothing had changed.
 Nothing had changed.
 He threw the papers onto the desk and ran downstairs and out into the garden.
