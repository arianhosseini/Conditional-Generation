Sweet stuff.
 “Canadian Sunset,” “Old Brown Jug,” “St.
 Louis Blues,” “Blues for Allen Felix.”  It was a revelation.
 But, never to be repeated.
 I think I was about 6 at the time, but that hour in front of Dick Delisi and the Syncopators is as fresh in my mind as if it happened yesterday.
 Man, my dad.
 What could he have been?
 Given different times, a different circumstance.
 He said something odd to me one time, he said: “Bud, music is a bad demon to have.
 Like hooch.

Why had I expected more from him?
 He was my watcher.
 He’d volunteered to help council bind me.
 But it didn’t stop the hostile stare I was sending his way.
 Ruby stepped in front of him.
 “I’ll stay with her.” He didn’t reply; he merely turned from her to walk into the haze.
 I was still fuming when she faced me, wearing a self-satisfied smile.
 She practically danced forward to plop down in front of me.
 “I have something for you, Frey.” I simply stared at her.
 She was harder to stay mad at.

Rodregas tried to scream, but no sound could pass his lips.
 CHAPTER 2 FROM THE ASHES
 When Rodregas awoke he was confused about why he was lying on the floor.
 As he opened his eyes he was also alarmed to see Captain Poir looking down at him with a confused and worried expression.
 Captain Poir said, “Master Ravenhurr?” It was a question.
 Rodregas wondered why his captain would think he was the Master.
 And then suddenly it all rushed back to him, all the details of the final ceremony.
 “Oh my gods he had burned!” Rodregas thought in alarm.
 He quickly raised his hand to his eyes, but instead of his scarred, wrinkled hand that should have been seared by burns; there was a powerful smooth hand.
 Rodregas reached up and touched his face.

But, Gracella was an impressive Immortalist and a rising star in the Guild.
 She had been Oreintvenir own Adapt when she was young, and as a favored member of the Guild, her friendship could prove important some day.
 “He simply wanted me to keep an eye out when I travel to the Cathedral of the Heavens,” he responded.
 The two of them were slowly walking back to his suite through the gleaming marble corridors with their wide windows and breath taking views of the city below; they both shared polite nods to other Immortalist, mostly young Adapts who resided in the city.
 She did not respond to his answer at first, finally she asked “Does he want you to keep an eye out for Oreintvenir?” Van’dret shook his head and said.
 “He mentioned Ravenhurr as a concern.” “But, he simply went mad.
 That is not uncommon,” she said with a voice laced with surprise.
 “Actually,” said Van’dret, “it is very rare for a Master of Ravenhurr’s level to go mad.
 I am not sure if you ever met him, but he was good, very good.” “Then in that case we had better all keep our eyes open.” She said.

He can be quite a brute sometimes.”
 “Come now,” Dieredon said, his face suddenly brightening into a smile.
 “He sounds like a real fine man to me.
 I wouldn’t be surprised if you two got married.
 Perhaps a kid or three.
 Little gray-skinned Aurrys crawling over the forest, wouldn’t that be cute?”
 She smacked him with her staff and then teleported away, leaving Dieredon to laugh long after her departure.

I believe he mumbled too.
 I looked for the girl with auburn hair, and wondered if she had bolted, too proud or afraid to surrender.
 Then a kid tapped me on the shoulder.
 I tapped Cliff and we followed the kid.
 He looked about sixteen.
 His haircut might have come from a Marine base.
 He wore glasses and a smile I interpreted as phony.
 He passed out a Bible tract, a directory of churches, and a card with his name and phone number.
 I thought, call you for what?
 This kid, I believed, had spent more time in church than outside in the real world.

We will be leaving in the morning.” Ruby’s words confused me.
 I must have read through the night.
 “Okay.” “Steed is here.
 You can stay with him or go with me.” “I’ll stay.” I listened to her footsteps recede.
 When I was sure she was gone I slipped the book into my pack and hid it inside the material of the white gown.
 We would be leaving tomorrow, traveling to the peak.
 I laughed to myself—no matter how many times I said it, I had no clue what it meant.
 But now there was an urgency.
 No matter if it held safety, no matter if it held my family secrets, it held my escape from the bonds.
 It held my only chance.

His expression showed nothing but his normal cheer.
 Instead of answering the Nymph’s question Rodregas asked him one instead.
 “Do you love her?” “Of course, I would not travel this distance for anyone else.
 Imeralda is an amazing young woman… beautiful, intelligent, charming and potentially a very powerful magician.
 I cherish every moment with her.” Rodregas’ heart sank at the news.
 Life with the powerful healer would be a far better one than one with his lost crusade.
 “Since you would ask me such a personal question, I have one for you.” Jordaan responded, “You are clearly struggling with what it means that Imeralda is a half Nymph, but have you thought about what is means that she is a half AElf?
 AElf maidens, when they mate with an AElf man, form a spiritual and magical bond.
 It is a bond that lasts all their lives and connects them on multiple levels as no other race is connected.
 That is why the AElves take so long to choose a life mate and almost never choose one outside of their race.

"That's it exactly.
 Anyways, I mostly just wanted to stop by and see if us girls can take you shopping tomorrow."
 The non sequitur really threw me for a loop.
 "I left my money at home.
 I'm not much of a shopper anyways."
 That last part sounded pretty weak even to me.
 "Don't be silly.
 Alec hustled you out of your house so quickly you didn't get to bring anything but the clothes on your back.
 Jasmin's clothes will fit you pretty well, but that's only a short-term solution.
 We need to get you stuff to wear, and since it was Alec who created this mess, it's only fair he be the one to pay."

"She's definitely distracted.
 You could even say utterly disconnected from the world.
 Completely free from the present, always living in the past."
 "I don't understand how any of this ties together."
 He looked up at me for the first time, and the tortured look in his eyes made me hold onto his hand as tightly as I was able.
 "It's all the same thing.
 Our touch, my touch, it's like a drug.
 It's addictive, subtly, so subtly most humans never even realize what is happening to them.
 I've seen what it's done to my mother.
 How can I say I love you if I turn around and do the same thing to you?"

“I’ll come for you tomorrow.
 Say 6:30.
 You’ll be waiting out front.
 Right?” “Right.” We stopped at the door to the lobby, looked back and saw Johnny’s convertible turn the corner.
 Then we hoisted our suitcases and double-timed up the road.
 We stayed at the cheapest motel, about a half-mile north.
 In the morning we hitchhiked to Fort Lauderdale.
 This was during college spring break, a sad time to be in that town if you were eighteen, on a peanut butter budget, and didn’t belong to a fraternity.
 The girls were taken.
 The parties were private, the bars off limits to minors.

“I’ll only end up hurting you.”
 “You won’t,” she said.
 “Here.
 Strike me with your blade.”
 The half-orc’s jaw dropped a little.
 “You’ve lost your mind?”
 “I said hit me, orc!” Aurelia shouted.
 Harruq snarled, and out came his weapons.
 He swung for her face, turning the blade at the last moment so the flat side struck her.
 The sword smacked off Aurelia’s cheek as if she were made of stone.

Being in cars that are driven too fast, mention of the wreck, other assorted things, and sometimes things nobody would expect trigger an attack."
 The words were striking into my mind with such force I almost forgot Rachel was whispering.
 None of it made sense, it had some things in common with the truth, but most of it was pure fabrication.
 "Why...I don't understand.
 Who would say that?"
 Rachel's face went from a mobile, beautiful thing to a near-perfect mask.
 Even in my befuddled state it was obvious she was lying.
 "I don't know, but you can use this.
 You're not being mocked or scorned anymore.
 True or not, that rumor is the most romantic thing anyone here has ever heard.

I think I passed out.
 When I woke up it was days later, I think, hard to be sure.
 He just left me to fend for myself, he didn’t care enough to do anything to help, he just left me lying on the floor.
 I still have some of the scars, most have faded, except for some of the burns he gave me.
 Jim – You ok Gene?
 Eugene – I don’t know.
 I hate that man.
 He’s evil.
 But I guess that doesn’t really matter right now.
 Your mom might not have been the greatest mother in the world, but she never hit you.

He was being pulled physically into the panther.
 He started to pull away, but then he stopped and let himself sink into the shape of the great beast.
 Panic set in as his mouth started to sink into the creature’s head.
 He tried to hold his breath, but he was too late for such an action.
 Rodregas tried to move but his arms refused to reach out and push the Daemon away.
 His arms felt wrong, like he had no arms to push.
 Then, true panic set in and he tried to fight his way free.
 Something was wrong, the greater sigil was not becoming part of him, he was being made part of the sigil.
 Maybe these were not like the Celestial sigils at all but some kind of Infernal trap.
 He choked, as instead of breathing air he felt liquid enter his mouth and pour into his lungs.

Some of them were.
 Some of them, I’m still proud of.
 I still love “Sandra Leathers.”  And I like Cocker’s version of “Sins of Monk Casaba.” “Satori at the Bitter Lemon,” “Call it the End of Enchantment,” “ Drudge’s Questions,” “The Dotage of a Fairy Tale Hero”…
 LE:  	It was Cassava, dear.
 BG: 	Yeah, right.
 I don’t remember them all.
 For obvious reasons.
 I still like “Overton Park Picnic” especially Soft Machine’s version.
 “Peace is Declared,” “We Bombed in New Haven,” “Wear your Nehru,” “Iris,” “Art Kane’s Jazz Photograph,” uh, “Chloe’s Ancient Face,” “Jack and Neal and Martin Milner”—(laughs), that one for Tiny Tim.
 That still makes me laugh.

He went next door to the smith’s and started gathering up tools, and loading them up into the smith’s travel trunk.
 The nicest tools were in a cabinet, and with a grunt (it was heavy even for him) he picked it up and loaded it into the cart, along with some other useful implements.
 He would need to carry as much food as possible as well.
 He quickly went back into the main keep and wrapped up the mattress from Captain Poir’s bunk and started carrying barrels of flour and other foodstuffs to his pile next to the front entrance.
 The drudge stared at him with a strange look but did not question his actions.
 He then realized that he should go up and check out the laboratory for anything else of value, and check out the dungeon to make sure all the prisoners had been freed.
 He had brought a proper crow bar from his visit to the smith’s and made short work of the laboratory door.
 The room had several large circles in the floor and tables and shelves along the side.
 The shelves held bones and bowls of strange fluids and other items whose uses he could not imagine.
 Anything that felt foul he threw into the fireplace, after getting a good flame going.

Vague, traitorous hopes that the other side of his face was marred with a birthmark, or a series of ghastly scars evaporated away as I took in eyes just a few shades darker than the blue of his shirt.
 Somewhere a cosmic force was trying to fix a pair of large, intangible scales.
 Scales that'd been twisted into a mangled mess and then torn into two pieces.
 I'd expected the shallow, narcissistic eyes of a runway model.
 Instead, the eyes that connected with mine hinted at depths I'd never even imagined existed.
 My lips, acting of their own volition, started to pull back in a tentative smile, but before they could complete the action, the heart-wrenching eyes narrowed.
 The emotions swooping across the surreal face were too quick to identify, but the way he turned slightly away as he passed all but proved they'd been a close cousin to distaste.
 Chapter 3 For a moment I was too busy mentally flogging myself to hear Britney's question.
 "Have you been to Vegas yet?"
 "No, we just got here last night."

None of us did, at that time, because we didn’t know what was going on.

 Something grabbed Seth’s legs and pulled him against a tree.
 He kicked and punched but couldn’t find the right place to hit his attacker.
 “Hold on!” Jason yelled.
 I opened my mouth to say that we already were when he vanished.
 Dragged away was my guess.
 My legs shot with pain.
 I heard Emily yell the first curse words I’ve heard her say in a while.
 I spotted her red arm just before my body felt like fire.

And Alec was like a composite of every gorgeous model ever born.
 I could get past that and see he was a jerk, but that was just because girls seemed to be wired a little different.
 None of it made sense.
 If Jasmin was dating Alec, why was she so mad at Lucy for talking to this Ben boy?
 I hadn't seen any other boys who were even close to as attractive as Alec and Brandon, and Jasmin didn't seem like the type to pick substance over form.
 Britney had wandered off to other, safer subjects.
 I nodded a lot and tried to avoid thinking about what life was going to be like if Jasmin was determined to kill me.
 There was just no way to know if I'd made the right choice in leaving when I did.
 Would Cassie hate me a little less because we were both potentially in Jasmin's crosshairs, or would she hate me all the more because I'd seen her humiliated and forced to back down?
 I finally finished the little can that represented my lunch.

With everything else going on right now he just might do it."
 It was actually pretty plausible.
 I probably would've believed it if not for Rachel's description of the new rumor floating around school.
 Britney was trying to cater to my supposed fear of being in a speeding car.
 Only, my supposed fear was actually a very real fear, just not for the reasons Britney thought.
 Chapter 11 Brandon arrived just in time to pick me up before I got on the bus.
 As expected, he teased me about not waiting for him at my house, but it was a small price to pay for not having to worry about how I was going to get to school if he didn't show up.
 We made small talk and all too soon arrived at school.
 As we pulled into the parking lot I was desperately looking for something witty or insightful to say.
 I needed to give him a reason to stay interested in me, but nothing came to mind.

She wanted to marry him.
 But she wanted to go home too.
 She missed her family.
 And she wanted to see Davis again--so she could tell him off.
 She wanted to tell him that now she knew how she should be treated by a man who really loved her.
 She'd tell him she knew what it was like to be comfortable with a man, to be able to snuggle up to him when she wanted to be held and to put her arms around his neck when she wanted to be kissed.
 She smiled, thinking about Rick's kisses.
 There was nothing in the world she'd rather do than kiss Rick.

 Johnny – Well she’s still alive.

 I even stuffed it with catnip and gave it to Mrs. Kodger’s cats.

Then again, maybe I was due for some happy endings.
 With a sigh, I thanked him for the ride, and we parted ways.
 The only thing of note that happened in Biology was that for a few moments at the beginning of the hour it almost seemed that the near-constant stares had somehow changed and taken on a more sympathetic tone than they'd had previously.
 It seemed silly to even entertain the idea.
 People my age don't really do sympathy very well.
 We're much more inclined towards ridicule and hasty, usually unfair, judgments.
 Still, something had changed.
 I held onto that hope right up until I saw Mrs. Sorenson joining everyone else in staring at me whenever I looked down at my book.
 There was no mistaking the look on her face; it was utter distaste, possibly with a dash of disdain.
 I was so tired of it all.

He explained that he had been through over a dozen programs before this program resolved his cravings and addressed his issues.
 He had been clean for six years, and I could only pray for the same result.
 He had worked there since he graduated the program and he assured me they would do their best to help Brandon.
 The facility where Brandon was staying was nearly a nine-hour drive from our home.
 We talked to Brandon on the phone occasionally and every time we did it was as if a cloud was slowly lifting and he was starting to think more clearly.
 He seemed to be growing up.
 He had never really matured like his younger brother because in his world of drugs he was not living reality.
 Easter was rolling around and we planned on visiting him with the family, but only if he completed certain parts of his program by Easter.
 If so, he would be allowed a LOA (Leave Of Absence) for the day.
 If not, we would have Easter with him at the facility.

 “It is a beautiful blade,” Harruq said, examining the elven weapon that had belonged to Ahrqur.
 They were killing the final hour before dark.
 Then they would hoist the wrapped body onto Harruq’s shoulder and sneak out of town.
 Qurrah sat meditating in a corner while Harruq yammered to himself.
 The blade was in one hand, the decorative scabbard in the other.
 “He was a skilled swordsman,” Qurrah said.
 “He was also arrogant.

 “They are the Ekreissar,” Velixar answered.
 “The Quellan elite are the only ones capable of raising and flying the winged horses.
 When they fly in, stay low, and aim your spells for their horses.
 The rider will die from the fall.”
 The man in black closed his eyes and spoke to the undead surrounding them.
 “Hide our presence,” he ordered.
 “Spread about, and do not halt your movement for all eternity.”
 The two thousand obeyed, scattering in a constantly moving jumble of arms and legs.
 “That should help keep our presence hidden for a time,” Qurrah said.

The number of single-party or military states and people under autocratic rule has fallen dramatically since 1980, and the trend continues.
 This shift to multi-party democracy, when coupled with a free press and an independent judiciary, vastly reduces the threat of large-scale wars similar to those that have twice shaken the world in this century.
 Three factors are at play in most conflict situations: the absence of developed democratic institutions, the absence or abuse of fundamental human rights, and the inability to make those choices in the management of public policy on which good governance depends.
 Authoritarian governments find justification for their existence in the presence of external threats to national security, in times of war and during periods of imperialist expansionism.
 They have a vested interest in maintaining a state of tension or initiating conflicts.
 In contrast, empirical evidence shows that liberal democracies do not go to war against one another.
 A study by Dean V. Babst of 116 major wars from 1789 to 1941 revealed that ‘no wars have been fought between independent nations with elective governments’.
 The reasons for this are several.
 Democracies tend to be more prosperous and better educated.
 They share common political cultures based on individual rights and liberties.

“It is real.
 No illusion and no disguise.
 You two cretins have god-damned elf blood in you.”
 “You jest,” Qurrah said, hanging back and showing no sign of aggression.
 The soldiers clearly thought Harruq the more dangerous of the two, and he was more than willing to let them continue thinking that.
 “No jest,” the guard said.
 “You two are leaving this city, now.”
 “My things,” Harruq said, his voice coming out as a weak croak.
 “I don’t see anything,” said the guard, scooping down and retrieving the scattered coins Harruq had dropped.
 “In the shed,” Qurrah said.

A comprehensive system is needed to monitor military movements.
 Through its resident representatives, the UN should openly monitor political, ethnic, nationalist and religious developments that increasingly lie at the heart of conflicts in order to understand the complexities of local events and to anticipate potential turbulence.
 The right to sovereignty should not include the freedom to privacy in cases which involve support for terrorist groups, instigating border conflicts, arms build-ups, torture and genocide.
 In addition to the role of the UN in consensus fact-finding, it must also acquire the jurisdiction to order fact-finding missions relating to both domestic and regional conflicts in which this type of violation is suspected.
 Cessation of violence and conflict settlement often leave unresolved the root causes of conflict, resulting in potential for renewed fighting or social turbulence.
 Peace-building activities should address underlying economic and social factors that prevent the establishment of a stable and secure peace.
 In instances such as Cambodia, Rwanda and Somalia, the vacuum created by the complete collapse of political and economic institutions necessitates a broader role for the UN in re-establishing the peace.
 Peace building has thus far been defined as post-conflict actions to support reconstruction and to strengthen and solidify peace.
 The concept needs to be broadened to include pre-conflict actions and expanded to encompass a wider array of potentially destabilizing factors that lead to conflicts.
 The Commission supports the establishment of an International Centre jointly operated by the UN Security Council and UNESCO to implement peace-building programmes.

Sometimes I visited my cousin Jill at her Pacific Beach apartment.
 Jill was nineteen.
 One Friday evening, she hosted a party.
 I drank several beers, then invited somebody who reminded me of Karen Flagstad to join me for a cruise up the coast road to La Jolla.
 Her name was Kris.
 She would go with me, she said, if not for a babysitting job she had that night.
 After she left, I drank more beer.
 Then I drove to a Jack in the Box on the coast road and found Kris there, in a Ford, hanging onto my cousin Jill’s boyfriend, Jimmy Dixon.
 Jimmy was one tough fellow.
 According to rumor, while fighting in the Golden Glove tournament, he had knocked another light-heavyweight into a coma.

Jasmin's backless black dress and shoulder-length gloves had streaks of blue that brought out her eyes, while Dominic's tight, red gown seemed to give her the confidence and poise you'd expect from someone so gorgeous and utterly exotic.
 Jess had opted for a sleeveless silver number that flared out at the bottom so much I wasn't sure how Isaac would be able to walk next to her without stepping on the shimmery material.
 Rachel's mauve dress was probably the most conservative of all, neither over-snug, nor especially low-cut.
 It had seemed entirely out of character considering what she'd purchased for the rest of us, but when I'd asked, she'd just grimaced and said Alec would've made her stay home if she'd chosen anything more daring.
 None of which helped me feel any more comfortable in the tight, strapless wonder Rachel had been so excited to give me.
 Even with all of the weight I'd lost since the accident, it still felt like the material was fighting a losing battle to stretch itself over my frame.
 I'd been hoping to be able to put off actually putting the dress on for at least another half hour, but when my makeup had finally been pronounced satisfactory, Jasmin had studied me for a few minutes, pulled my hair back, secured it with a pair of silver combs I was worried might actually contain genuine diamonds, and then helped Rachel cram me into the dress.
 If Jessica hadn't grudgingly complimented me on just how good my hair looked, I might have suspected Jasmin was trying to purposefully make me look worse than the other girls.
 Dominic and Rachel had to tell me I looked good, that was an unwritten girl-rule regardless of what species you were.
 Jessica had no such imperative, so I was forced to conclude Jasmin had done the best she could considering what she had to work with, and resigned myself to being the homely one in the group.

The next morning, the group seemed in unusually high spirits.
 I had no idea why the mood had shifted, but I enjoyed the laughter and joking anyway.
 We rode past a waterfall, the roar of water making me curious.
 I figured Ruby was my best bet.
 Chevelle gave me no answers and though hers were sometimes cryptic, I knew she’d been reading books on magic.
 “Ruby, is there a way to harness the power of things… like that waterfall?” Grey glanced at me.
 The look of concern for my intelligence was not exactly uncommon, but it was something I could never quite get used to.
 “Not that I know of,” she said.
 She got her mischievous grin then.
 “Though I did read once that there was a way to steal life force and use it for yourself.” Chevelle shot her a stern rebuke from the front of the pack.

From minimum needs to maximum potentials
 The factors which have perpetuated commodity-based planning in agriculture have also fostered an emphasis on minimum targets, rather than maximum goals.
 Often government has perceived that its responsibility was to ensure sufficient food to prevent famine, not maximum output and profitability.
 Government machinery has proved effective in forcing through radical measures to disseminate new technology, seed and production methods in the face of crisis, but it usually lacks the driving impetus to work for the highest benefit of individual farmers.
 The shift needed is for planners to study the potentials of the agricultural sector to serve as an engine for job creation and higher incomes, and as a stimulus to industrialization and exports, and then to formulate national goals to maximize exploitation of these potentials.
 Integration of agriculture, marketing and processing
 Conscious efforts can be made to foster the natural linkage between agricultural and industrial development by placing emphasis on crops that have the greatest potential for stimulating the growth of agro-industries, services and exports.
 Filling in the missing links in the chain of processing and distribution, such as pre-cooling for fruit and vegetables, can enable small farmers to produce for national and export markets; it also results in higher at-farm prices and creates alternative forms of rural employment.
 Empowerment of women
 The vast majority of women living in rural areas are engaged in agriculture.

“You look like you’ll need shelter, sunshine,” he explained.
 I stared in disbelief as the trees split to form a low lean-to.
 He shot me another wink; I couldn’t be sure he was kidding.
 The tearing and popping noises ceased, and I examined his creation.
 Quite impressive really.
 He didn’t even seem to be watching, let alone concentrating.
 And no blessings on it, no thanks to Mother Earth.
 It seemed he was just enjoying himself, not being responsible to the magic.
 Magic that I needed.
 That I wanted.

“This world is young, Qurrah, and Karak and Ashhur are young gods.
 Only five-hundred years ago they came and gave life to man.” Those eyes twinkled.
 “I was one of the first they made.”
 The half-orc pulled his ragged robe tighter about him as he stared into the fire.
 “How is that possible?” he asked.
 A soft wind blew, making the fire dance, and in the flickering flames Velixar smiled.
 “I was the favorite of Karak, my dear orcish friend.
 He gave me life when other men would have long turned to dust.
 When he was defeated, and his servants were cast into the abyss, I alone escaped punishment.”
 “I am not orcish,” Qurrah said, harsher than he meant.

I arrived at the original briefing spot and I got out of the truck and the lead officer immediately began to tell me this was a good first contact and that I would get them.
 I tried to interrupt him with my feelings of distress but he would have no part of it.
 He complimented me on holding my ground so firmly.
 In fact, he and his partner asked me if I had done this before because I was so stern with her and refused to bend.
 I guess they were accustomed to dealing with strung out drug addicts.
 I was still completely disappointed and I told them so.
 I just wanted this over and I had every expectation that it would be finished tonight and I could get on with my life and my son could get on with rehab and hopefully get healthy.
 Once I was un-wired I was able to call my wife who was a sobbing mess.
 Not hearing from me and the uncertainty of the night had taken its toll on her and my son.
 I headed home defeated and unsure if I would ever get the opportunity to complete the task that would free my son from a three to five year prison term.

 Months later, Harruq awoke at the dawn, jerking upward and uttering a sharp gasp.
 A constant cry of danger rang in his ears.
 A quick survey showed he slept alone in their small shed, his brother missing.
 “Qurrah?” he dared ask.
 “Outside,” came Qurrah’s muffled reply.
 Harruq stretched, pushed away a plank of wood from the window, and climbed out.

I gasped, shocked, and my horse picked up its pace to ride beside Chevelle.
 Chevelle held up two fingers slightly to silence me.
 We hadn’t ridden more than a quarter of the way into town when he turned the horses to a medium-sized structure, stopping before a water trough.
 He dismounted effortlessly and pulled me from my horse and into the building in a few quick steps, closing the door behind us.
 It was dark inside, his fingers lingering on my arm.
 I felt him shift, waving a hand as several lanterns around the main room lit, giving off a soft glow.
 He indicated a door on the rear wall.
 “Your room.” I drew back my hood, nodding.
 “I have some business to take care of before we move on.” Move on?
 So this wasn’t our destination.

Their eyes were a bright yellow that matching their teeth and their fingers looked like gnarly old trees.
 And the smell; it was awful.
 They grabbed my feet, back and tugged at my hair.
 “Why does everything always happen to me?” I complained.
 No one heard me.
 The ugly creatures continued tugging at me like annoying two year old, which made me get really annoyed.
 “Get off me ugly looking toad dwarfs.
 Hey, that’s what I’ll call you, toad dwarfs.” I smiled at my quick thinking.
 I could be clever sometimes.

As the trail was more of a hunting path than a proper road and they were traveling on an upward incline, the wagon was struggling to make much time.
 It was not until their midday stop that the three had any real conversation.
 “So,” asked Imeralda, “where are we going?
 I assume it is not the Northern Kingdoms as you said to Audrian.
 For one thing that would be stupid, and for a second you seem to be climbing ever higher into the Arida Mountains and that is hardly the best way north.” Rodregas nodded.
 He hoped to make it to his hideaway by nightfall, so he decided it did not hurt to share his plan at this point.
 “You’re right; we are not going to the Northern Kingdoms.
 A few companions and I were hiding out in the Aridas and in one of the higher hollows I found an old farmhouse.
 It has been abandoned for a long time, but it is well made and there is water and lots of fruit trees and berry bushes that must be left over from an old orchard.” After a moment he added, “I always thought that if I ever needed a place to hide out that it was ideal.
 Of course it will be rough there.

I stood there woodenly for several seconds, unsure whether or not she was through.
 She finally made a shooing motion and turned back to grading papers.
 Predictably, there were still a half-dozen other kids in the classroom.
 They all turned back to the door and started filing out again, but by tomorrow half the school would know exactly how badly I'd just been humiliated.
 I found myself just outside the tutor lab with no recollection of having stumbled to my locker, or going by Physics to grab the stuff I'd left there.
 Still, somehow my Spanish book had disappeared, replaced by my math book.
 My knees started shaking as I entered the room, but I made it safely to my normal table before they gave out.
 "Adri, Adriana?
 Excuse me."
 I didn't recognize the girl standing across from me, but based on her uncomfortable expression and the fact that more than one person had turned for the sole purpose of watching us out of the corner of their eyes, she'd been standing there longer than I'd realized.

 Mrs. Tranton looked up in surprise.
 "Has Davis proposed?"
 "No, of course not--you know that I would have come screaming to you right away."
 She smiled at her mother over her teacup.

But Buddy had in him a black spot, fed by his desire to make it big, fed by ambition and greed and the sort of misdirected thinking which took Rolling Stone from the hands of the movement and placed it in the hands of the oppressors.
 The commodifying of the sixties, if you will, as embodied by the soul of Buddy Gardner.
 Buddy “Slipshod” Gardner, Memphis’ answer to Jerry Garcia, Memphis gift to the world, from integrity and precocity to sell-out.
 So much is lost now, so little written down, so little recorded.
 For those with the stamina to search it out, Black Lung made one album, released on the Pepper label, a little Memphis soul mixed in with their own acid-blues.
 It was called Turntable Poison.
 Some say it sounded like The Rascals crossed with Hot Tuna.
 One cut comes to mind, a piece they played in every set at The Shell, the ballad, “Mr.
 Handy and Hakel-Bärend.”  On the LP they insisted on the extended version with Buddy’s long, side-handed solos, slick as molten lead and the twelve minute drum solo by Skippy Quetzalcoatl, effectively killing the album’s potential sales but insuring the group a spot in infamy alongside the lost tapes of Mudboy and the Neutrons and the missing five hours of von Stroheim’s Greed.
 There was also the shorter, “Blues for Wendy Ward,” with its plaintive chorus, “Thank you for at least that sweet ache,” a phrase Buddy made sound like a supplication to the gods.

The period following September 11th, as US National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice put it, is one “not just of grave danger, but of enormous opportunity.”
 Resolving Local Conflicts: The Commission concluded that the end of the Cold War made it possible to successfully resolve problems that had resisted solution for decades, such as the many violent communal and ethnic conflicts occurring in the world.
 The near total cessation of violence in North Ireland during the past 10 years is proof that rapid progress can be made on issues involving apparently intractable communal sentiments.
 This achievement appears astounding to those who lived through the earlier decades of religious violence and until recently found it nearly impossible to imagine a mitigation of the conflict in the foreseeable future.
 We would do well to examine closely this instance to draw lessons that may aid in addressing those conflicts that continue to defy resolution.
 The most striking lesson of the Irish experience is that rapid development absorbs and dissipates the urge for violence.
 The dramatic economic advancement of the Republic of Ireland – whose per capita GDP rose within the past 20 years from less than 60 per cent that of UK to 95 per cent in dollar terms and 130 per cent in terms of purchasing power parity – has eliminated the disparity between Ireland and Ulster and fostered among the Irish in both countries a sense of pride, an expansion of employment opportunities, and a more focused channelling of social energies into productive activities.
 Economic growth in the region was augmented by the systematic efforts of the British government to eliminate the active discrimination against the minority Catholic population of North Ireland in housing and employment as well as the segregation of Catholic and Protestant education.
 Violence has subsided, yet a political solution still defies the policymakers, because some of the root causes of the problem buried far in the past have not yet been adequately addressed.
 A steady and concerted effort for permanent solution in Ireland will demonstrate the possibility and provide the knowledge necessary for addressing other intractable communal problems around the world.

As it entered the wound, the tracker gasped and my smile stretched wickedly.
 I wormed my way blindly up his leg, intent on getting the information I needed.
 They’re getting closer.
 They’ve found us a third time now.

 I wanted to free my mind, free my bonds.
 They won’t take me.
 Something about that last thought didn’t seem right, like it wasn’t mine, but I couldn’t follow it.
 The tracker screamed; it had reached his thigh.
 My eyes flicked open.

Chevelle held his hand out in a formal greeting.
 “Chevelle Vattier.” “Vattier, eh?” I thought I heard the stranger mutter under his breath, “Well, you can call me Bonnie Bell.” Chevelle waited unmoved for his response.
 He finally held his hand out in return.
 “Steed.
 Steed Summit.” They shot me a glare as my giggle slipped out.
 Steed stared at me.
 He especially didn’t seem to think it was funny.
 “Our lineage is long and we breed the best stallions in the land.” Chevelle spoke up.
 “Yes, I have heard much regarding the lines of Free Runner and Grand Spirit.
 Tell me, is that what brings you out this far?” They carried on the exchange and Chevelle explained we’d be needing horses.

He could feel Jordaan’s magic start to pour into his hands and into the frog.
 A sensation emanating from the frog began to fill his senses.
 Without Rodregas’ conscious will, his own magic raised from the core of his being.
 The two magic forces seemed to mix and then enter the frog.
 They seemed to pour from the frog back into his own body.
 That power felt like a thousand small knives digging into his flesh.
 His body tightened and he could feel Jordaan’s hands hold him firm.
 Rodregas struggled to keep his arm from spasming in pain.
 He knew that Jordaan could not really keep his arm from moving.
 He kept thinking that the ordeal would be over soon.

My knees gave out and I crumpled to the ground.
 How many times could the earth be pulled from beneath my feet?
 Chevelle took a step toward me and I held up a hand to stop him.
 Bound against using magic.
 Assigned a watcher.
 My anger toward him returned, swift and unforgiving.
 He had been a volunteer.
 “Let’s just go,” I said coldly, looking up the mountain.
 We rode wordlessly on as I chewed over this new knowledge.
 As my watcher, Chevelle would have been involved in the binding by Council.

By signing up you'll receive $10.00 worth of free books (including Torn, the companion book to Broken).
 We'll be offering a special discount to existing fans for the first week each new book is live, so signing up for his mailing list will mean that you'll always know about new releases with plenty of time to take advantage of the new release discount.
 Readers are strongly advised to pick up Torn next and then proceed on to Splintered.
 The most cost effective way to purchase Splintered is as part of the Bitten Reflections Story Bundle.
 Bitten gets you the next six installments of the Reflections series—plus a bonus short story—for 37% off of the normal price.
 Author's Note: In some ways it feels like I've been at this for decades, in other ways it feels like I only just sat down to try and put Adri's story down in words.
 Now that it's live, I can only say that I hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
 If you haven't read Torn yet, please go check it out.
 When I set out to write Broken, I never expected that I was going to end up writing the same story from Alec's point of view, but I'm pleased with how both Broken and Torn have turned out, both individually and as a combined work.
 They are done in very different styles, but ultimately that was exactly what I was after.

Jim – Lemme see.
 Sweet mother of crap!
 How did you manage that?
 Liz – I don’t know.
 I think the bag was rigged.
 Karen – What’s wrong?
 Jim – We got the z, the q and the x all at once.
 Art – Lucky, you got all the good letters.
 Eugene – I don’t think I know any words that have a z in them.
 Cleo – Of course you do handsome.

 BG: 	In a manner of speaking.
 Yeah.
 Lorelei is always there to keep me straight.
 God is me, in me, you know?
 That’s what she’s saying.
 That’s what she’s always been saying, but people couldn’t hear her, for whatever reason.
 They wouldn’t listen.
 Just like I say in “Burn my Bridge”, you know?
 “There’s a black and white photograph/On my finger is a tiny bird.”  You know?

The next morning they repeated the Morning Prayer and meditation ritual.
 This time while Doi’van joined in, Imeralda mostly watched.
 Afterwards Rodregas said to both, “I have been thinking that we are probably going to be here a few weeks while I finish healing up from the knife wound.
 I want to make the most of the time.” Doi’van said, “I have a feeling that you have some sort of training in mind.” Rodregas nodded and said, “I have developed some bad habits the last few years; I know my technique is rusty and now my timing is all off with my new body.
 I am not sure what your training backgrounds are, though.” He said, waving at Imeralda, who often of late was holding her Black Yew bow close with an intimacy that spoke more of a caress than holding a weapon, “Clearly, Imeralda likes the bow.” Rodregas continued, “Even though Imeralda plans to stay out of the middle of things, learning some basic hand-to-hand and sword fighting is a good idea.
 Doi’van and I can spar with each other, which will help us get used to fighting against the sigil warriors of The Immortal Guard.
 So, I think we should practice every morning until noon, then work to try to get the farm cleaned up during the rest of the day.
 At dusk we can work again on our fighting technique.” Doi’van nodded and said, “Before we battle a group of Immortalists or The Immortal Guards, we need to get some decent armor and weapons.
 They will have the finest equipment that the Guild sorcerers can make or buy.
 While the two of us might be a match for most of the sigil warriors’ one on one, their equipment will make them hard to beat.” “I agree that has to be something we figure out,” Rodregas said, “but, I am actually thinking decent horses might be more important first.” “Horses?

Development is like a chemical reaction that is determined by the variety and quantity of elements present and the conditions under which they are put together.
 If one essential element or condition is missing, a social transition like a chemical reaction may not take place at all.
 The absence of peace in war-torn Africa or democratic freedoms in former colonial nations, the absence of social stability or an entrepreneurial class, the absence of a functioning banking or educational system, the absence of the minimum necessary infrastructure for transportation and communication – any one of these may be enough to prevent transition until the deficit is made up.
 If even an inessential element or condition is missing, the process of transition may take much longer than would otherwise be necessary.
 Lack of information, lack of education, lack of necessary skills, lack of supportive laws or incentives or protection against losses – insufficiency in any of these areas may be enough to slow or delay the process of change by years or even decades.
 The world needs a coherent intellectual framework for understanding and dealing with radical transitions.
 High priority should be given to developing a fresh conceptual approach that is not en cumbered by allegiance to existing theories and systems.
 Transitions should be regarded as social transformations which depend on and result in corresponding changes in the political, economic and other spheres.
 Efforts to guide a multi-dimensional social transition through uni-dimensional strategies, particularly those limited to manipulation of macro-economic policy, are unlikely to yield the anticipated results.
 Even those transitions which are apparently confined to economic activities within a stable political context necessarily depend on changes in social attitudes and in social institutions which can be dealt with most effectively by assuming a wider perspective of the process.

When the words finally made it out, they seemed to fight me the whole way, clawing at my throat with such force that by the time they finally exited my mouth, they were the barest hint of a whisper.
 "Because I'm worried once you realize just how much of a loser I was back home, how much of a loser I still am, you'll decide you don't belong with me."
 "Why would you not dating very much have any impact on how I feel about you?"
 "Because in addition to being the most thoughtful boy I've ever met, you also happen to be rich enough to buy a small country.
 You're so incredibly gorgeous girls swoon when you walk into a room.
 How can I possibly compete against the kinds of girls who'll continue throwing themselves at you for as long as you're breathing?"
 Anger managed to accomplish what all of the swallowing hadn't.
 The diatribe that'd started out nearly inaudible had grown in volume until by the end I was hissing loud enough the people closest to us turned around in curiosity.
 Alec calmly captured my wildly gesturing hands, immobilizing them with a casual strength that made me feel like a child.
 "Please don't do that."

 Jim – Well it turns out that Gene wants to be adopted into our family.
 Liz – Are you serious?
 Jim – Sadly yes.
 Liz – What do you mean ‘sadly yes’?

 Do you know what kind of hell that will be?

By my latest calculations I was only about two weeks from being all caught up.
 Lunch was interesting.
 I was still the odd man out, but it was amusing watching Vincent preen.
 I never did figure out what it was he'd done, but apparently it had him thinking he was even more of a stud than normal.
 Whatever it was, it had Brandon pissed, which was a refreshing change.
 If he had to be friends with some of these people out of responsibility, that was one thing, but letting them continue to be jerks was taking it too far.
 Nobody was more surprised than me when Brandon pushed back from the table, scanned the room, and then pulled me to my feet.
 We spent the rest of lunch pacing around the outside of the school while he worked through whatever was bothering him.
 When the warning bell finally rang, he turned and looked at me with a considering smile.
 We stood like that for a good thirty seconds before he reached a single finger up and traced the left side of my face as he leaned in slightly.

It didn't look so different from Rick's, she decided.
 They didn't have any white roses like he did, nor an electric fountain, but they had red roses and azaleas, just as he did.
 She wished she'd brought back a picture of him.
 But a picture wouldn't help much, she knew.
 She wanted to be in his arms, kiss him, touch him.
 She wanted to lie in his arms as she had their last night together.
 She wanted to make love with him and fall asleep with him and wake up with him.
 Sounds of breakfast preparations brought her out of her reverie, and she realized she'd been crying.
 Wiping her eyes, she went inside.
 She was sipping orange juice at the table when John came down for breakfast.

He even came home from work earlier than he had been just to be with me.
 And he took me--places."
 She'd started to say to Hollywood, but her mother might start asking questions about exactly where she'd been and why she hadn't been able to get home.
 "We-we went to the--we went shopping.
 He bought me clothes and all kinds of interesting things.
 And he held me, Mother."
 She looked into her mother's eyes earnestly.
 "Whenever I was frightened or sad, he held me.
 It became so natural to move into his arms for consolation.
 And I felt so comfortable with him.

"What?
 You finished up your homework already and she left.
 We can totally talk right now.
 What do you think happened?
 I'll bet she just got some really, really bad news."
 I felt a dull ache starting behind my eyes.
 "Just because I finished my Physics doesn't mean I don't have other stuff I need to do, and I don't even want to guess at what would make her go that white.
 I just hope whatever it was turns out not to be as bad as she thought it was."
 Britney rolled her eyes.
 "Please, like you don't have just as much reason to hate her as me.

The wave sent Qurrah crashing against a giant undead man still wearing rusted platemail.
 The collision blasted the air from his lungs.
 When he hit the ground, stars filled his vision.
 Dieredon fought but could not resist that same wave of power.
 The point of his blade halted a foot from the top of the black hood before he flew back.
 In the distance, Qurrah watched his master glaring at the damned elf who had fallen like a mad man.
 “Scoutmaster,” Velixar growled, his voice deep and dark like an ancient daemon of old.
 “Twice you have looked upon me and lived.
 No more.”
 Dieredon twirled his bow, his face calm and emotionless.

 Liz – Not likely.
 Jim – Why not?
 Johnny – The man has made up his mind.
 Jim – Could we get the law struck down as pointless and un-constitutional?

One would slash out, hoping for an opening, then back away as the other guard lunged, preventing Harruq from any chance to counter.
 Blood ran down his arms and sides from several minor cuts.
 The pain was good.
 It helped focus his mind.
 It also fed his rage.
 “Kill me,” he shouted to one guard after another hit and fade.
 He smacked away a thrust but did not attempt to counter.
 “Can you not kill me?” he asked, holding his swords out wide.
 Neither one attacked, instead holding their swords in defensive positions.
 Harruq shook his head, feeling his anger growing.

Aurelia shrugged.
 “We’re outnumbered four to one.
 We might win, but we’ll still suffer many deaths.
 If I am needed, I will fight.”
 “No,” Harruq said, running up and grabbing her arms.
 “No, you must understand, you can’t fight.
 You can’t!”
 “Why?” she asked as tears formed in her eyes.
 “I can’t lose you, Aurelia.
 Please don’t fight.

"Don't you have to crank it up?"
 she asked when he got in without doing so.
 "No."
 He turned the key, put the car in reverse, and backed out of the garage.
 She gave him directions, trying not to notice how different all the houses in the neighborhood looked.
 "There--over there!
 That's my house!"
 She jumped out before he could stop completely and ran up to the front door.
 Rick dashed after her, grabbing her arm before she could open the door.
 "We'd better knock."

“Hey, you alright?” I sat up and Seth helped me up.
 I rubbed my sore back and looked around, taking in the dead looking trees and shadows.
 “Where are we?” “I don’t know, Jazell.
 The creature must have been a setup to bring us here,” he replied.
 “I think I know who did it.” “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure that out, Seth,” I pointed out.
 I looked around.
 “Where are the others?” Seth went pale.
 “I don’t know Jazell, they aren’t here.
 They’re just gone.” My stomach twisted into a knot.
 We had always been a group of four and now it was just the two of us.

I thought of what he’d said before, the dangers of messing with the bindings.
 He must have read it on my face.
 “That’s enough for now.
 Rest, Freya.” I didn’t argue.
 Ruby came in, as if on cue, and Chevelle excused himself.
 I laid down, but irritation kept me from sleep.
 I returned to the book.
 I spent the next several weeks visiting him.
 I had forgotten about the rest of the camp.
 He had become infatuated with me and I couldn’t keep myself from indulging him.

"Please.
 Do you really believe I have that kind of willpower?"
 "After the things I've seen you go through I'd never doubt your willpower, Adri."
 It was rare that I suffered from a panic attack in Alec's presence but the reference to what I'd lost, combined with my dreaded nickname nearly did the trick.
 As my pulse sped up again Alec pulled me in close.
 "Sorry about that.
 You do have to admit, it would help explain why you're still here."
 "Right, gorgeous, rich boy who also happens to be the next best thing to a super hero.
 I must be out of my mind not to run for the hills."
 "You don't like it when I spend money on you and the more involved you get with me the less likely it is I'll be able to protect you."

Jim – You got his hair perfect, but I don’t think he’d stoop to something that low-tech and effective, knowing Gene, he’d probably build a catapult and try to coax the elephant onto it, and then see how far an elephant can fly when it’s launched through the air by a weapon of war.
 Liz – Also knowing Gene, he’d build the catapult way too small, or he would launch himself on accident, but with his luck he wouldn’t die.
 The poor old lady that he’d land on would break his fall.
 But what Gene would try to do in real life doesn’t really matter, as that drawing isn’t literal.
 On with the critique.
 Jim – I also liked the one with all the bright swirls of color on top of that layer of white.
 It’s just seems so cheerful and happy, it really cheers me up.
 You must have been in a good mood when you painted it.
 Liz – That one is called ‘The Storm,’ it’s about my parents’ marriage and all the fights they have all while hiding it from the rest of the world.
 Jim – Oh, well it could have been cheerful.

The War was just this endless one-note playing over and over and driving us insane—me insane, sorry, driving me insane.
 And, like, I know that a song is just a song—yet, I have to believe there is something there, an element, a catalytically charged element.
 I didn’t want religion—who listens to priests, clergymen, even those who take to the streets?
 Ali has more power.
 Ali reaches more people.
 But a song, you know, a good song, well, it does tunnel deep into the consciousness.
 Did I think I could do anything with the right words, well-placed, well-played?
 No.
 No, I knew better.
 But, I did think—I do think—that we had to stand for something other than pop ditties, you dig?

Jim – You just fear the mad sumo skills.
 And it’s Skinny, Sumo Assassin’s sidekick is named Skinny.
 You also forgot about the sumo-mobile, anybody who drives a steam roller with a built in jet engine has my loyalty for life.
 Besides Skinny has great super abilities, he can slip into places that Sumo can’t go.
 Not to mention he’s a master of disguise, he can speak 12 languages fluently and women dig him because he is a master on the dance-floor.
 Eugene – The Sumo-mobile is just a cheap rip-off of the bat-mobile.
 The entire story is about a famous millionaire sumo wrestler turned vigilante.
 “Wrestling for the honor of the downtrodden.”  What the hell were they smoking when they came up with that one?
 And Twiggy?
 No chicks would ever like him, he weighs 50 pounds, chicks like guys with big muscles.

As he read the article, he understood why she'd found it so difficult.
 Everything was presented in a way that made it seem like accomplished fact when in reality it was all theory.
 It was based on Einstein's theory of relativity.
 These wormholes Marie had mentioned were passages formed around black holes, which were collapsed stars.
 And it was all based on the assumption that something besides light could travel at the speed of light.
 In one small paragraph he found that the entire article was theory upon theory: no one had ever found a black hole or a wormhole or anything that could travel faster than the speed of light.
 "You didn't miss anything," Rick told Marie, setting the article aside.
 "Scientists think that it would be possible to travel through time by going through these wormholes the author mentions, but it's all theory.
 Nobody has ever discovered a wormhole, and none of this stuff has ever been proven."
 Marie sighed.

CM: 	It really angers you, that this stuff is out there.
 BG:  	Sure.
 Does that make me a control freak?
 CM:  	No, no.
 BG:  	It’s just that, you know, we’re toiling here in a medium which few accept as art, few accept as anything but stuff for teenagers to fuck by.
 Right?
 So, to try and instill in it some of the eternal verities, well, it seems pretentious.
 But it also seems meet and right that one should try.
 Lennon said something about nothing being new in rock after “Great Balls of Fire.”  In a sense, he’s right.
 I mean, I’d never question his authority.

As a result, for millennia we have tended to overlook or, at best, grossly underestimate the greatest of all resources and the true source of all the discoveries, inventions, creativity and productive power found in nature – the resource that has made minerals into ships that sail the skies, fashioned grains of sand into tiny electronic brains, released the energy of the sun from the atom, modified the genetic code of plants to increase their vigour and productivity – the ultimate resource, the human being.
 World Food Prize recipient and father of India’s milk revolution, Dr V. Kurien, has decried the tendency to credit external factors for the accomplishment of people.
 ‘It is the farmer that has produced this miracle, not the cow.’ And so it can be said of the Industrial Revolution and the Green Revolution.
 Looked at from a different perspective, the entire evolution of civilization is a progressive act of humanity’s self-discovery.
 At each stage of external observation and exploration, people have discovered more of their own inner capacity for resourcefulness.
 The material, technological, political, economic and social development of the world over countless centuries is an external expression of the growing discovery by humanity of the unlimited creative power of mental ideas, emotional aspirations, physical skills and higher values.
 The real process of creation and development is from the immaterial to the material, from the inner to the outer, from idea to invention, from aspiration to achievement, from the lofty value of freedom and the ideal of self-determination to the founding of democratic nations, from the soaring emotions of an emperor’s love to the beauty and grandeur of the Taj Mahal, from the urge for adventure to the discovery of a new continent, from the technician’s joy in expressing perfect skill to the marvellous powers of a microprocessor.
 All begin as an inner urge that expresses externally in life.
 Leadership in Thought
 In times of crisis, great leaders rise to remind us that the true resource is ourselves.

Liz – Jim, you have some strange dreams.
 Jim – Tell me about it, the weirdest one yet is when you, me, Johnny and Gene were exploring this haunted mansion, Scooby Doo style.
 Yeah, that was a weird one.
 Liz – What happened?
 Jim – Well there were things that one would expect in a haunted mansion, ghosts and dancing skeletons and strange noises.
 But then on top of that Johnny and Gene actually got along well.
 They actually paired up to explore the mansion willingly, and they didn’t kill each other.
 That’s not the weirdest thing, but you get the point.
 Liz – So you and me were teamed together?
 Jim – Yep

“Promise me now, or I will drag you back to the elves and let them deal the justice you deserve.”
 Harruq glared into the fire.
 It was such an easy promise, but could he keep it?
 What if Velixar ordered otherwise, or someone close to Aurelia struck against Qurrah?
 He sighed.
 In his heart, he knew he could never again strike at Aurelia, regardless of what anyone else wanted of him.
 The look on her face when he had stabbed her, that combination of sadness and shock, would haunt him forever.
 “Fine,” he said.
 “I promise.
 Happy?”

 Far from town, a blue portal tore open above empty grass.
 The big half-orc tumbled out, followed by a flustered Aurelia.
 Upon her exit, the portal closed, swirling away as if it had never existed.
 Harruq groaned, spitting out dirt that had made its way into his mouth.
 “Where are we?” he asked.
 “About two miles east of Woodhaven,” she told him.
 Harruq glanced around, unable to see the town in the distance.

 CM: 	Why is that?
 BG:  	Nothing Freudian, Creole.
 You know, we live in circles, they keep turning, sometimes the circle includes someone and sometimes it doesn’t, and sometimes it turns back around and involves that person, you know?
 Right now, my circle is me and Lorelei.
 And my music, which is a manifestation of us.

Transitions should be regarded as social transformations which depend on and result in corresponding changes in the political, economic and other spheres.
 Efforts to guide a multi-dimensional social transition through uni-dimensional strategies, particularly those limited to manipulation of macro-economic policy, are unlikely to yield the anticipated results.
 Even those transitions which are apparently confined to economic activities within a stable political context necessarily depend on changes in social attitudes and in social institutions which can be dealt with most effectively by assuming a wider perspective of the process.
 Clear visualization of the before and after states of transition, the existing system, the goals to be sought after, and a detailed picture of the changes that need to occur in behaviour, attitudes and institutions are necessary for deriving the most effective transition strategies.
 With the knowledge the world possesses today, with the example of many successful nations over the last four decades, and with its highly educated and motivated people, surely the nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia can abridge the time required and the hardship of lessons learned by trial and error to a few years.
 But this cannot be accomplished by sweeping remedies or hastened by over-eagerness or impatience.
 It will require application of a profound understanding of the process of development and transition.
 We believe that a properly conceived effort to draw on the best available knowledge and experience of other countries can generate a transition strategy that avoids the dangers and pitfalls of the initial approach to reform and puts in place the essential foundations for the new system to function effectively and generate benefits for the people before the dawn of the new century.
 In the preceding chapters we have tried to draw attention to the uncommon opportunities that the world presents at the dawn of a new millennium for the abolition of war and the eradication of poverty.
 None will question the desirability of achieving peace, democratic freedoms and prosperity for all.

 She turned to wave to him.

 He watched her play for a couple of minutes and then headed back toward the blanket.
 Marie ran after him.

Back then.
 It was her father, man.
 He was a cunt.
 And he started manipulating Crafty and then us, through Crafty.
 And he would have these fits, like epileptic fits, like anger that couldn’t be dammed.
 He was out of control.
 I think he’s still trying to worm his way into the music business—I don’t really know.
 But he didn’t know a fucking thing about music or the business and he wanted a part of Black Lung, because it looked like we were the next Cream, the next Experience, the next Mountain.
 Whatever.
 He just wanted a slice of the pie, man.

We didn’t often have visitors, and I could count on a new spruce twig the times we’d had fresh berries.
 Might as well enjoy them.
 I popped a ripe juneberry into my mouth as Aunt Fannie rounded the corner.
 She was on her way into the room, having dashed back to her stash of wine as soon as the visitor had hit the door.
 She peered at me out of the corner of her eye, twisting the cork free of the bottle.
 Maybe it annoyed her to see I was eating her berries.
 Not that she’d picked them; I was sure she’d just set a charm on an unsuspecting squirrel to make it perform her manual labor.
 “Company?” I was enjoying the bitterness of a spireberry now.
 “It seems there was some trouble in town today,” she said.
 “The elders are in an uproar.” I didn’t question any further.

Are you sure you want to give it up?"
 Alec looked back up at me, and his eyes were filled with incredible need.
 I was suddenly struck by the similarities to the me he'd painted, and what I saw written on his face.
 It seemed impossible he would be unsure, that a glorious being like him could ever need anything I could provide, but I couldn't deny it was there.
 There was no way of knowing what it was, but I didn't care.
 Whatever it was he needed I wanted to give him.
 I opened my mouth to say as much, but my vocal chords wouldn't cooperate.
 I was still trying to verbalize my feelings, when his free hand came down to my chin and gently pulled it up.
 My heart stuttered and threatened to quit as his lips slowly came down to meet mine.
 My only other experience had been so terrible that I nearly panicked, but before I could formulate a protest, or even decide if a protest was what I wanted, our flesh touched.

You kids back off!"
 The words seemed to float in from far away.
 They certainly didn't have an effect on any of the shape shifters.
 Vincent was moving too slowly for my human eyes to detect any change, but I was sure he was closer now than the last time I'd looked.
 The feeling of insects marching across my skin intensified as James started shaking.
 Jasmin and Dominic both followed suit within seconds, and the feeling doubled as several of Brandon's wolves went into near convulsions.
 "I said break it up!"
 Mr. Paterson shoved his way past a pair of Brandon's wolves, and for a split second I thought they were going to turn and kill him.
 A heartbeat before they moved a low, barely perceptible growl washed over the entire scene.
 I realized that the sound was coming from Alec, spreading out from him in ripples of calm.

Sometimes no matter what a person does as a parent, children may travel to dangerous places.
 Some will return from those places unharmed and some may never return.
 A family can look perfect from the outside but be quite the opposite on the inside.
 I have lived such a life.
 I do not know what made me do what I did for my son but I can only surmise that it was a combination of all of the defining moments in my life that lead me to where I am today.

That is why knights or others who could afford the cost wore all that metal.
 Rodregas had to shrug; he had no answer other than an extended fight with the mace that often did not end until one or the other was too tired and battered to defend themselves.
 Doi’van nodded at Rodregas expression of confusion, “My clan is known as the greatest warriors there are against heavily armored opponents because we are masters of the halberd.
 With a halberd we can quickly dismount an armored warrior, knock him to the ground and then, with the leverage provided by the halberd…” He swung his staff and acted like he was holding down a foe with his left foot.
 He made a savage two-handed thrust downward, “...we can pierce his armor and win the battle quickly.” Rodregas nodded.
 He was not sure what this halberd weapon was; Rodregas assumed it was some sort of spear from the way Doi’van was holding the staff.
 Rodregas did not see how a spear could do what Doi’van was suggesting, but since Doi’van had been up for learning the Kata, he would be willing to learn how to fight with a long piece of wood.
 Doi’van then stepped forward and started swinging the staff with such mastery as to make it beautiful.
 The staff was but a blur as it whirled in one hand and then the other, behind his back, over his shoulder.
 It was a dance.

 Tears slid down her cheeks.
 "I love you so much, Rick.
 I wish-I wish I could say let's just forget about everything else and make love.
 But I-I just can't."
 "I want to make love to you more than I want to take my next breath.
 And if you said yes, I'd stop thinking altogether and spend all night making love to you.
 But when all I had left was my memories, I'd feel guilty that I'd taken your virginity and let you go back to 1927 with the guilt I know you'd feel.
 And-and I'd never know if maybe you were pregnant."
 The horrifying thought gripped his mind.

I had no idea who this was and I probably shouldn’t let on who I was.
 He noticed my open mouth, blank expression, and sat again, eyeing me questioningly, all humor gone.
 “You seem to be really good at magic,” I offered.
 He chuckled.
 “Is that so?” “Yes, well, I… I need to learn.” “Learn?” The humor was gone again.
 “What do you mean learn?” “I’ve never, well, except for fire, and I need someone to teach me… and you’re…” I waved a hand in his direction.
 His brow rose.
 “I don’t understand,” he said, clearly concerned about my mental state.
 Maybe I was a few nuts short of a bushel.

“Tell me more.” It was all I could do to pay attention to his words, but I was fascinated by their sound.
 “Her father was a dark elf.
 When her mother died during childbirth, he left her here in the village.
 I suppose it was for the best, really, since she can’t fly.
 The fairies would have tormented her.
 She’s still a bit of an outcast though.” He was still talking as I struggled to catch up in my head.
 I interrupted him, unable to stop myself.
 “My mother died.” I had no idea why I was speaking.
 I batted my eyes and tried to shake it off, concentrating on Steed again.
 He seemed to notice I was back and continued his story.

They bred the animals methodically, striving to combine certain traits, bring them together in a single horse.
 With each generation, they strengthened the line, even bringing in new breeds from other lands to add to the list of desired attributes.
 Smoother gait, better endurance, stronger health, longer life.
 I faded off somewhere during the part about bloodlines.
 I woke late in the evening when Ruby switched places with Steed.
 She had brought some meat back with her and we supped together before I headed off to bed.
 Ruby didn’t question why I would be sleeping again so soon.
 She was busy being excited about her upcoming trip.
 I didn’t share her enthusiasm, so I retired to my room and read more of the journal.
 There were many sad passages after the passing of the writer’s mother, though their bond didn’t seem traditional.

She looked beyond me at the few inches of open floor, and I took the opportunity to bolt past her down the hall, straight out the door at full speed.
 I ran from the house, ignoring the paths; other elves would be no help to me.
 I kept running until I was certain she wasn’t coming, and then I collapsed at the edge of a meadow, breathless.
 I dropped my face into my hands, and might have wept if I’d not been so fueled by fear and adrenaline.
 “Freya?” a soft voice asked.
 I looked up, startled.
 Chevelle stood just in front of me.
 He dropped to his knees and reached out to touch the mark across my cheek.
 Shame flooded me, and I turned my head to hide the evidence, but his hand cradled the side of my face.

 He opened his shirt and, as he suspected, another purse hung from his neck.
 It was of flat leather and inside it were twelve pieces of silver and a small book.
 Rodregas tentatively touched the book and it buzzed slightly of magic.
 It held no foulness so he tossed it into the trunk.
 He added the coin purses to the robe he was wearing.
 He still needed more hard money and some decent clothes.
 Rodregas looked out the window to see a few people leaving the keep grounds, and a few still hanging around the yard.
 He knew he could not leave without everyone seeing him.

He did not get far though, for a sharp burning pain enveloped his wrist.
 His arm jerked back, and the sudden force spun him to his knees.
 As he knelt there, a voice spat down at him.
 “Pitiful.”
 Jeremiah looked up to see another half-orc clad in ragged robes.
 The fire came once more, wrapping around his throat.
 Smoke blurred his vision, the smell of his own charring flesh filled his nose, and he dropped his sword to claw at his neck.
 Flesh burned off his fingers.
 He felt the pain fade away.
 Then nothing.

Jason looked up and I saw his face was full of concern.
 “Can you help Emily, she's trying to release the trapped dragon,” I whispered to him.
 Jason nodded.
 “Will do Jazell.” He stood up and walked over to Emily.
 I sat on the ground next to Seth.
 His eyes were closed and he looked dead.
 His blue hair was ruffled up in all directions.
 I was so sure that he might be dead that I placed a hand on his chest, feeling for a heartbeat.
 I felt the steady thump under my fingers and I sighed in relief.
 I removed my hand and looked over at Emily.

Don't forget to turn in your assignments on your way out."
 Anxious to make sure I got credit for all the work I'd done, I hurried up to the front of the class before Alec could get to his feet.
 "Oh, Adriana.
 It looks like you've been busy."
 She took my handwritten report, and then held out a hand as Alec approached.
 "Somehow I rather suspect you both have the same answer, Alec just used twice as many words to get there."
 I shot Alec another dirty look, but it slid right off the armor of his arrogance.
 He nodded to Mrs. Alexander, and then slipped out of the classroom.
 "Run along, young lady, we wouldn't want you to be late for your next class."
 Spanish went about like I'd expected.

I smiled as I praised her.
 “It’s beautiful.” One eyebrow shot up and she jumped from the bed, grabbing my wrist and pulling me with her.
 I hoped she hadn’t smudged the design.
 I checked it as soon as she stopped in front of her mirror and let my arm go.
 “And this.” It wasn’t a question.
 She was proud of her work.
 The eyes that stared back at me in the reflection grew large as they took in her mastery.
 Gone was the girl I’d been in the village.
 This woman, dressed in leather and dabbed with war paint, was striking, imposing even.
 Her dark gaze might have been fierce if it weren’t round with astonishment.

Development-oriented laws, policies and programmes that can be more fully implemented.
 A huge surge in development can be achieved if every socially available resource and potential is fully utilized by the people – if every capable youth, male and female, continues education up to the level of his or her highest aptitude; if every family employs all the health care knowledge and best practices known by the society; if every government self-employment programme and training programme is fully utilized; if all known technology for improving agriculture is widely publicized and put into practice; if every successful system and institution is replicated and applied to full advantage.
 The highest priority must be to evolve strategies for utilizing these vast social resources more effectively.
 The magnitude of this potential is illustrated by the enormous gap, referred to earlier, between average yields on major food crops achieved by poor developing countries in Asia and Africa and the yields obtained by the world’s most productive producers.
 Proven technology already exists that is capable of raising low yields well above the world averages.
 The real limiting factors are inadequate dissemination of information about best practices and success stories, inadequate skills in employing these methods, inadequate organizational arrangements for marketing and processing, as well as out-moded policies and attitudes about food self-sufficiency and the role of agriculture in the national economy.
 Developing these individual and institutional resources should be our highest priority.
 Theory of Development
 A greater knowledge of the process of development that we seek to accelerate is the first essential resource needed for achieving the goals set forth in this report.
 The UN Secretary General has rightly drawn attention to the worldwide crisis in development economics and called the need for new thinking on development ‘the most important intellectual challenge of the coming years’.

They feel it is more… pure.” He pronounced ‘tainted’ with an edge.
 “Is it?
 Tainted I, mean?” “I have lived on it for—” His words caught midsentence and he said, “Well, it doesn’t seem to be, but to each his own.” He turned back to the fire.
 Junnie came back into view, a large animal slung over her shoulders, bow in hand.
 She dropped her burden on a smooth gray rock near the fire and whispered a short thanks before removing the arrow to skin the animal.
 My gaze moved between the sizeable carcass and her lithe form.
 “I’ll be traveling fast and far and don’t intend to stop and hunt.
 I will pack the extra with me.” I managed a sheepish smile.
 It seemed like I needed things explained a lot lately.
 “Where will you go?” “Back to the village.” “To council?” I breathed.

I see inside people.
 Shape shifters really, but every once in a while normal humans as well.
 I can see their potential, and when they develop gifts, I can see the shape those gifts have taken."
 "Gifts?"
 "The most powerful of the Fir'shan, the hybrids as the younger generation calls them, occasionally develop unusual abilities.
 Alec's father's was that of being able to heal himself more rapidly than normal, even for our kind.
 Thanatas, the legendary king who defeated the southerners, was said to be able to mold his own body, making powerful changes that made him unbeatable in combat."
 Mallory's explanation was tickling the back of my mind.
 "Is that why Brandon's unbeatable?"
 "Nobody is unbeatable, but yes, that's why Brandon is such a formidable adversary.

"Believe what you will.
 There's no reason to worry about a concussion."
 "Then why did you tell the sub I'd hit my head?"
 He looked away for a moment, almost as though deciding whether or not to tell the truth.
 "I presumed you wouldn't want to stay and be subject to everyone's questions.
 You seem not to like people prying about your attacks, and you were less happy than usual today.
 I thought you could use the break."
 Apparently he'd decided against the truth option.
 "I looked unhappy today?
 You, who never crack a smile unless you're going to get something out of it, were concerned about the fact I wasn't all smiles and giggles?

For the trip.
 I can't believe you're taking me to Hollywood.
 I can't believe you're going to Hollywood just for me."
 "I'm going to have as much fun as you are."
 He stroked her hair.
 "I love being with you, Marie.
 And I love seeing your excitement.
 Every time I see you get excited about a microwave or a dishwasher or a blacklight, it makes me want to think of something else I can show you or give you."
 Her heart tightened.
 "Thank you."

His stance was similar to Rodregas’ own.
 Rodregas went slowly but steadily, keeping his guard up.
 The boy kept his hands up.
 When Rodregas went in low he took the blows to his body and went for Rodregas’ face.
 Against another opponent it was the right move.
 Unfortunately for the boy, his blow seemed to come at Rodregas slowly.
 Rodregas easily dodged as he landed a strong blow to his opponent’s chest.
 Rodregas was used to sparring with Doi’van and was surprised when his opponent went flying into the line of contestants and did not get back up.
 Rodregas waited a moment and then looked at the knight who stood outside the match.
 The knight did not look as surprised at the quickness of the match as Rodregas.

We plummeted to the ground, falling closer and closer… Oh man, I thought and closed my eyes.
 Don’t look, don’t look, don’t look… “Really!” Seth yelled at the sky.
 “This brings new meaning to ‘things can’t get any worse!’” I gripped furiously to the limp dragon.
 I was falling to my death: so this is how it was going to end.
 I never pictured it this way; I thought I would die a little more heroically, not screaming like a little girl.
 “Not now Seth,” Emily screamed at him.
 “Everyone think!” “How can I think,” I screeched back, “when the ground is rushed towards me at full speed?” “I don’t know Jazell, just think if you want to live,” she said quickly.
 I let out another scream as my body tipped towards the edge of the dragon.
 I felt someone wrap their arm around me and I gave a grunt as I was pulled upright.
 Seth held me, his arm stiff and somewhat uncomfortable.

The cover photograph of Black Lung’s Pepper Records album, Turntable Poison, is an unaccredited Eggleston photograph.
 (It is, of course, a weathered Sinclair sign, imbued with the enchantment Mr. Eggleston brought to all his work, a divergence quite inexplicable.)
 Buddy was loved, revered.
 He was not held to the same rules as everyone else.
 So it goes with the great.
 And when Buddy started using drugs, mixing bennies, reds and laxatives in dangerous quantities, no one was there to question him.
 Of course, drugs were part of the scene then.
 They were everywhere.
 In the back of every minibus, in the bathroom of every nightclub, at practice sessions, in the homes of every groupie.
 And Buddy had his groupies.

Doi’van did not look up from the ground where he was trying to straighten out a shield without doing more damage and said, “I wondered that myself.
 Apparently most drop out by this point.
 A lot have been injured, especially during yesterday’s sword and shield competition, and many simply quit due to not having any points yet.
 If you are going into the most dangerous part of the competition to be injured or killed and you have only one or two points, why bother?” Doi’van said.
 “To be honest, I am surprised how many are left.
 There are still quite a few young fools out there.” “So how many are left now?” Rodregas asked.
 “Fifty-four, on my last count,” Doi’van said.
 Rodregas was a little worried about his shield and wondered if he should jump in and rescue it from the powerful grip of the Hellborn, but he held his tongue and let Doi’van handle the equipment.
 “I see you are employing the forces of the Infernal Realm to aid you in the joust,” said a voice behind Rodregas.
 Rodregas unfortunately recognized the voice as that of Ambassador Van’dret even before he turned and saw him standing there.

He then heaved the armored man in the air, something even he could only do for a moment, and then slammed him down onto the smooth sands of the arena.
 Nordien hit with such force that his arms and legs flew like a small doll’s.
 Rodregas fell on top of the armored form, grabbed the bottom of the helmet, and ripped it off.
 Unfortunately, it was firmly secured.
 When Rodregas ripped it off he took a good section of jaw with the helm.
 Rodregas then threw the helm aside and punched the man in the face, full strength, several times.
 His first hit smashed the front of Nordien’s face.
 The second blow shattered it.
 The third blow smashed the head to pulp.
 Rodregas probably should have picked up Nordien’s mace and shield, but he also knew that without plate armor, he could not afford a long drawn out series of pounding matches.

The next day, after Spanish class on Friday, I recounted my ordeal to Karen and explained that all my suffering certainly must have earned me her company at the movies.
 She congenially disagreed.
 While Eric and I drank bourbon and ginger ale, I griped about Karen.
 At first I acted tough and unruffled, but soon the bourbon took hold, and I confessed the pain in my gut that had nothing to do with fasting.
 He asked why I got so obsessed about Karen, knowing I never had pursued anybody else so boldly.
 Should anybody except Karen want a date with me, she had better tell her friend to pass the word along.
 I wouldn’t even ask any other girl for a dance without having already gotten the nod.
 Karen had pink, full lips and plenty of curves, and lively unhaunted eyes.
 She read books for fun and spoke softly, humbly, and acted just as nice to the lowly as to teachers or big shots.
 Besides, I had lately spent a day and evening, first at school, then at a community dance, and afterward at the Burger Hut, asking people whether they often felt guilty about something but had no idea what it was.

Winds of change, winds of creativity.
 Lorelei has taught me much, man, many things I can’t even tell you.
 You’ll get it—you’ll see where it’s all been heading.
 Anyway, Memphis, yeah, it’s still part of that—the signpost on the road.
 Memphis still burbles up through even my most contented piece of songwriting, still smolders underneath it all.
 So many musicians came through Memphis, man, came through, came from.
 Some never got any recognition, yet they fed the stream, they kept the mojo alive.
 Bluesmen who played because playing was what they did.
 Making ruckus.
 They didn’t have record contracts, they never made money.

I thought the pair of you would make a great team."
 The easiest thing would have been to stay quiet and just let her believe I'd played an integral part of the project, but I didn't like getting credit for something I hadn't done.
 It was the worst kind of lying.
 "Mrs. Alexander, I didn't actually do any of it.
 I kept making mistakes."
 She chuckled so hard, for a second I thought the pencil behind her ear was going to fall out.
 "I rather suspect you're understating your accomplishments, my dear.
 Didn't contribute indeed.
 As if Nora's favorite student would just sit around while there were equations to solve."
 I felt like I'd been hit in the stomach.

The entire world burned to ash and blew away on the wind.
 The painting revealed beneath was in fluid motion, an artwork of death and fire.
 He saw a city burning, people fleeing in the streets, and then he saw himself dressed in black armor that oozed power.
 Salvation and Condemnation waved high above his head, both drenched in blood.
 He looked like a god among men, and the way the soldiers fell at his feet made him think he might have been one.
 This red-dream self looked straight at him and spoke, but Harruq could not understand the words.
 The sound of his own voice chilled him, though, for it was dark, it was dangerous, and it was exactly like Velixar’s.
 _A god among men,_ said a second voice, one he had never heard before.
 It was darker than any shade that haunted his nightmares.
 There was only one it could be, and it was no mortal.

She still didn't look very happy, but there was a trace more self-control to her face than a few minutes before.
 "Britney, despite spending at least an hour at the tutor lab each afternoon, the quality of your homework hasn't come up in the slightest, so I took the liberty of talking to your father yesterday."
 Britney's gasp had all the dramatic effect you'd expect out of someone who'd spent the last decade of her life getting away with pretty much whatever she wanted.
 She was obviously pretending to be sorry, all the while figuring her current trouble would blow over quickly enough if she just played her cards right.
 "Your father agrees with me that your studies should be your highest priority, so you'll be staying an extra hour starting today, and ending once your performance improves.
 Of course you can always continue to just waste your study time, but if you choose to do that I've been assured that additional penalties will follow quite rapidly starting with the loss of your car."
 The next gasp was less impressive, but tangibly more genuine.
 Even my being next couldn't stop a flash of satisfaction at the way Britney was finally having to face some of the consequences of her actions.
 Mrs. Campbell dismissed her with a wave, waiting until she'd left, shutting the door with a tad more force than strictly necessary.
 "While I can't for a moment understand why you've chosen to befriend Britney, I can't fault you on your willingness to help her despite her flaws."

Unwilling to spend another hour in worry, I let my thoughts drift over to another, dangerous area.
 Thinking about Brandon wasn't safe anymore.
 He'd started out making my stomach knot up simply because he was so gorgeous, but lately my insides had started jumping around for other reasons.
 I wiped away the light sheen of perspiration on the back of my neck, and wished the world was simpler.
 If only I was still in Minnesota, or anywhere other than this crazy, secretive town with its ridiculous share of gorgeous boys.
 Boys who didn't behave much at all like any other popular kids I'd ever known.
 Alec hated me, Brandon stopped by to give me a ride to school every day, and neither of them should have even realized I was alive.
 If I couldn't be at home, couldn't the universe have at least arranged for me to get involved with a nice, normal, uncomplicated, plain-looking boy, or barring that to remain safely uninterested in boys altogether?
 At the very least, someone out there should have managed to keep the air conditioning working.
 By the time English ended, I felt worse, albeit for different reasons than earlier in Biology.

His armor had saved him, but the elf had managed to penetrate deeper than he thought.
 “Are you fine, Harruq?” Qurrah asked, glancing back and halting his walk.
 “I’m coming,” he said, marching after his brother.
 He hid his pain well.
 The alley opened up to the main street, running south from the center of town into the forest beyond.
 It was there that the bulk of combat had spread.
 Elves battled in the street, horribly outnumbered.
 They were skilled, though, and a steady stream of arrows from homes continued to weaken the human forces.
 “Halt here,” Qurrah said.
 To their right was a two-story elven home.

CM:  	Uh…some people see in your “California” LPs a kind of return to innocence, a willful perspective that is more Edenic, or childlike.
 Would you say that you are seeking innocence with your recent work, that you are moving toward artlessness?
 BG:  	You would say that.
 I think you just did say that.
 Artlessness?
 Hm.
 I wouldn’t have used that word, but I like it.
 Yes, strip off the artifice, cut off the fat.
 Too many rock lyricists—you can think of them as well as I can, say, that guy with Procol Harum, or that Emerson Lake and Palmer shit, or some of Jim’s stuff, which, to be honest, I can’t stomach, all that lizard king shit—they’re purposely making with the lit-rock attitude, you know?
 They want you to study their lyrics.

Is that alright?”
 Qurrah walked over and put a hand on Harruq’s shoulder.
 “You may be with whoever you wish, my dear brother.
 Just do not try to deceive me.”
 Harruq nodded.
 “Alright, then you can come this morning.
 We’ve got to hurry though, or we’ll be late.”
 “I am ready,” Qurrah said.
 “When _you_ are ready, lead on.”
 The big half-orc flew about their home, grabbing his old swords and donning his faded leather armor.

"Once Alec is dead, there'll be repercussions for everyone else?"
 Again the short, reluctant nod.
 I had so many questions I still wanted answered, but it didn't seem fair to get Isaac in any more trouble than he was already in.
 "Will you be okay?
 I mean with Alec.
 He's not going to torture you or anything for telling me, is he?"
 Isaac's smile somehow completed his face.
 Funny how I'd never thought there was anything wrong with it before, but after finally being rewarded with something more than his normal, serious countenance, I had the first hint why he was one of Rachel's favorites among the pack.
 "It's likely I'll be exceedingly sore for the next few days, and my ego, such as it is, will likely take quite the beating, but our Kir'shan, our Alpha as you would say, isn't a bad sort."
 That was a relief.

As we caravanned home, I realized the collection of vehicles carrying us back to Alec's estate probably cost more than my house.
 Donovan had met us at the door and conducted us to the dining room, where Alec and his friends devoured a sizable meal.
 Even back when I'd had a more substantial appetite, I still couldn't have kept up with the wolves.
 Even the girls packed away more food than I would've believed possible for such slender frames.
 I mentally shrugged and added it to the list of shape shifter benefits.
 Able to eat like a complete pig and still slip into size zero jeans.
 Dominic spent a couple hours after dinner helping me with Spanish.
 She probably would've spent even longer with me, but Mom called, so Dominic slipped out to give me some privacy.
 I fielded something like a hundred questions about school, reassured her two or three times that she wasn't a terrible mother, and promised yet again to stay one hundred percent out of trouble while she was gone.
 I was beginning to wonder if I was ever going to get off the phone when she finally decided, ultra-late shoot tomorrow or not, she'd better go to bed.

Crafty, who had a face like moits in wool, attended East High where he had picked up the bass guitar (and put down his flugel horn much to his parents’ disfavor) when he first heard Jack Bruce play.
 He wanted to be part of a power trio.
 He wanted to be part of the best power trio Memphis could build and he wanted to build it.
 He called Sid who said, “Well, you could do a lot worse than hooking up with this young guitar kraken, Buddy Gardner.”  Crafty called Buddy.
 Buddy called Skippy Quetzalcoatl, who had a drumming lineage like no one else’s.
 His father had been a drummer and his father before him and back and back.
 Beale Street whispers the name Quetzalcoatl, late nights when the horns have died down and the wind sloughs around shop corners and up alleyways.
 It whispers the name like a mojo, a bit of song never transcribed, a bit of the old magic.
 The abandoned gas station stood on a corner in midtown Memphis like a sepulcher, but it was soon to be transmogrified into a holy place, a place where anything could happen so beware.
 A place as bright as Sun, as holy as Stax.

When he was gone, the smaller half-orc slipped back into the shed, removed a false floorboard, and grasped a small pouch containing various herbs, bones, and knives.
 Reaching back in again, he took out an object wrapped in sackcloth and soaked in blood.
 A knife in hand, he opened the pouch and closed his eyes.
 His mind attuned, he carved into the remains of a man’s heart.

 On his way back home, the threepence jingling in his hand, Harruq spotted a patrol of guards approaching.
 He glanced to the right, where the small alley led back to their shed.
 If he hurried, he might be able to make it before they noticed…
 He was halfway down the alley when he heard a voice call out.

We tried to see how high we could make one climb before…‌ what?”
 She was smiling, but when pressed she refused to answer him.
 Instead, she stood, brushed off her dress, and flipped her hair over her shoulders.
 “Same time tomorrow?” she asked.
 “Sure,” Harruq said.
 “But how many times will we be doing this?”
 Aurelia shrugged.
 “Until I feel you have paid me back.”
 “So what, a couple days?”
 “You know very well I can’t obtain any proficiency in such a short time,” she said.

“The hills of Camber.” I looked at him, my watcher, and thought his features were peaceful for the first time.
 Junnie had said he was from the North, and I wondered if this was his home.
 Maybe that was why he’d truly brought me here, a much-needed vacation from the duties of council, the task of being a watcher.
 They’d never know, as long as he got me back soon.
 When we reached the lake, the horses stopped and in the quiet shadow of this dreamlike encounter, I forgot I was riding.
 The mountains and lake were almost too much to take in; none of it seemed real.
 This time, Chevelle was next to me before Steed had the chance.
 As my horse knelt, he held out his hand and I stepped down beside him.
 The three stallions followed Steed to a nearby tree where he fed them small green-skinned apples from its branches.
 I glanced back to Chevelle.

 A blue portal ripped through the air before Qurrah, beckoning him.
 He looked through but saw only mists and distorted landscape.
 Seeing nothing to lose, he got to his feet and stepped inside.
 He felt the sensation of traveling a great distance yet his mind insisted he had taken only a single step.
 He could see the orange glow of the great pyre several miles away.
 “Brother!” Harruq cried, wrapping him in a hug.
 Qurrah endured it, keeping his hands at his sides.

The two traveled in between the hills, exhausted but unwilling to stop their movement.
 “Why did you fight the elves?” she asked when their silence had stretched for more than half an hour.
 “It’ll be a long story,” he said.
 “We have time.”
 He chuckled.
 “Aye, I guess we do.”
 He told her of Velixar and his plans.
 He told her of the strength, weapons, and armor granted to him.
 Hesitantly, he recounted killing Ahrqur and the people of Cornrows, a fresh wave of shame filling him as he thought of both.
 “What part did Ahrqur play in this?” Aurelia asked.

He described how he rubbed the backs of the young men who vomited and comforted them as they reeled in pain from withdrawals.
 He remembered the video of himself and the comparison was obvious.
 From there Brandon went through every stage of the program as an intern instead of a student.
 Brandon even took incoming calls from parents who had children that they were attempting to get into rehab, just as we had called when we were desperate to find our son a place that would help him.
 I have also volunteered my time through Narconon to talk to any parent who calls and wants to talk to another parent who has experienced the nightmare they are living.
 It is hard for me as they tell me their horrific stories of a life we once lived.
 They tell me it is great to talk to someone who understands what they are experiencing as a parent.
 Most have no one who can relate so they keep their family secret and they try to figure out what to do just as we did.
 I don’t judge them.
 My mother used to say, “I’ll always love you, but sometimes I don’t like you.” I now know exactly what she meant, as I felt that often as a father.

This project would prove to be a huge challenge that would last seven-plus years, partly because it coincided with the start of Brandon’s drug use.
 What started as a project he was very enthusiastic about became an afterthought to time with friends and partying.
 He would show up for certain monumental events like when we put the body back on the frame after it was painted, but I was pretty much on my own with it for a bit.
 My wife was a champ as “that thing” (her nick-name for it) sat in a million pieces in the garage for so long.
 Seeing Brandon heading down the wrong path, I knew only what not to do.
 I had no idea what to do.
 I remember a lesson I learned while coaching youth sports.
 “The hardest kid to coach is your own.” A true statement.
 I found myself unable to dissuade my eldest son from the dangerous road he would travel.

I wondered if this was fiction, a fairy ruse, given to Chevelle by Ruby.
 Or maybe the dust was still playing havoc on me.
 I glanced over my shoulder at Ruby where she watched anxiously out the front window.
 I shook my head, finding the line again…
 But I couldn’t deny it.
 Their size was about that of an elf, but all were different.
 The men were thicker.
 Not necessarily with muscle, some more bulbous.
 The women were varied as well, some thin and wiry, some stout like the males.
 Their hair was in all shades—light blond like the sun, brown as the trees, one even had rusty red, his plump cheeks peppered with light brown spots.

He ended up with a pile of clothes.
 Some were fancy, but none would be of much use on the road and none were worth selling.
 Next, Rodregas went to the wardrobe, which was engraved with the shape of trees and made of a sweet smelling wood.
 It was much more likely to hold something of value.
 He opened the doors to see brightly colored robes, and there on the left was a suit of chain mail.
 Rodregas could feel his smile.
 Armor!
 He reached in and pulled it out.
 The chain mail was light and seemed to flow around his fingers; the links seemed to be made of silver and he recognized it as Mithril.
 Ravenhurr had a suit of Mithril chain; he could feel his heart start to beat in excitement.

My silence was answer enough.
 “It will pass.” I hoped she was right.
 Chevelle was watching me, anxious now.
 “Is everyone all right?” I asked.
 My throat was raw, my voice sounded as if it had been through a grater.
 “Are you?” he replied in a low tone.
 I couldn’t be sure.
 He hesitated, almost not wanting to ask the question he knew he must.
 “Can you tell me your name?” “Elfreda,” I answered immediately.
 He waited for the rest.

“How destructive, I wonder?”
 “Get rid of it,” Harruq said as he picked up the other sword the orc had dropped.
 “You disagree?” Qurrah asked, his delight vanishing into a sudden frown.
 “No,” Harruq said.
 He thought to explain and then just shrugged.
 “It makes me uneasy,” he said instead.
 “But do as you wish.”
 The frailer brother approached the end of the alley where the sound of combat was strongest.
 His steps faltered only once.
 When Harruq moved to catch him, Qurrah glared and leaned against the side of a house.

My asking you now has nothing to do with our conversation from earlier today."
 "Why are you doing it now then?
 I half expected you to try and send me out of the country again.
 An invitation to the local equivalent to Prom was the last thing on my mind."
 The pair of ants disappeared, hidden among the lush grass that somehow managed not to look out of place here on the edges of the desert.
 I was starting to realize that the best way to get information out of a guy was to wait him out.
 Sometimes applying a little judicious pressure here or there helped, but it was largely just a matter of letting them work through whatever internal barriers stopped them from sharing their feelings.
 "My taking you to the dance is one of the more selfish things I could be doing.
 It represents so much of what I want, but is wrong for you on almost every level.
 I guess I've just decided I'm tired of trying to be good when I have so little time left."

But now he's beginning to look more like Eric.
 Eric possessed by Jesus, I can adore.
 I still see him.
 I can watch the lines of his face change as I tell him about my fears or longings.
 I can hear him speak thoughtful words.
 Fear v. Love
 While speeding on Interstate 5 north out of Sacramento past orchards and pastures, with long miles between the small towns, I think back to my talk with Toni, the part about suffering from panic attacks.
 During five of those hard years, while I taught in Chico, I often drove this highway to visit writer friends in San Francisco.
 This part of I-5 terrified me, with visions of a sudden attack that would deny me control over my mind or body, leaving me helpless and miles from the closest nurse or doctor.
 For no good reason except the fear of fear, my heart would race, my lungs and throat constrict, my hands become slick with sweat.

He put a slice on a plate and handed it to her.
 "Thank you," she mumbled, not looking at him.
 "Marie."
 He caught her free hand and squeezed it until she looked up at him.
 "It's OK.  We're friends, we like each other--nothing should make us feel uncomfortable with each other, should it?"
 She smiled then.
 "Did they give us napkins?"
 They went to bed early that night because they had to be at Paramount at 7:00 the next morning.
 Marie, fortunately, didn't question the earliness of the hour.
 The surprise he had for her hinged on the word of a friend of a friend, and he didn't want her to find out about it and then have it fall through.

“Perhaps we were meant to go to Woodhaven.
 The journey will not be long, perhaps a week or two at most.
 There are enough animals about for me to kill, so do not worry about food.
 As for water, there are many small streams, and we can beg from the occasional farms we pass.
 We were to leave anyway, now we do so sooner.”
 “Sooner?” Harruq said.
 “We paraded through the city like criminals and were tossed out with swords at our backs.
 If we were to leave, I wanted to leave on our own terms, not like that.”
 He swore a few times, getting progressively more colorful as he went.
 “Two minutes alone with that guard,” he muttered.

 Of course, the bluesman.
 The bluesman’s bluesman.

It reminded me of a fight I'd seen between two feral dogs while I was still in grade school.
 The dogs had circled for five or ten seconds, and then one had thrown himself at the other.
 A neighbor had broken the fight up with a few thrown stones before it'd come to a grisly end, but it'd been obvious once the first dog had latched onto his opponent's throat that it was only a matter of time before the smaller dog would've died.
 This was exactly the same, only it happened faster as Jasmin blurred into motion.
 One moment she was growling at Jess from a distance of more than five feet, the next instant she was on top of Jess, and her teeth were latched around the smaller wolf's throat.
 Dominic's hand tightened on mine as Jess began to whine, but Alec took a menacing step forward and Jasmin released Jessica with another growl.
 "She didn't want to let go, did she?"
 Dom looked for a second like she wasn't going to answer, but she finally shook her head.
 "It's harder to control the instincts, the beast inside us, if you will, while we're in an alternate form.
 Hybrid, wolf, cat, to one extent or another, we become the beast, and if there's one thing animals have figured out, it's that you don't survive by letting a beaten opponent live to learn from their mistakes."

Jim – He’s never gonna change, always gonna have those delusions of being an evil overlord or something.
 Liz – Evil overlord!
 Hah!
 He’s about as evil as Mr. Rogers.
 And he spends way too much time in the Land of Make Believe talking to little hand puppets.
 Jim – Well, there was that one time where he threw those water balloons at Mr. Svinvali down the street.
 Liz – he didn’t get within 10 feet of the old man, and he was off and running before the single water balloon that he actually threw was halfway too his target.
 He’s a wimp, and a poor shot.
 He always runs out of courage before he achieves his goal of becoming ‘evil’.
 Jim – It was pretty funny when Mr Svinvali caught up with him.

A boy that cute wasn't nice to a girl like me unless he wanted something from her.
 Mrs. Campbell walked over while I was casing the room.
 She still looked stern, but her face had relaxed slightly.
 She even smiled as she handed me a green, laminated card.
 "You'll need to pick out an empty table, we don't let students share here.
 Also I'd recommend choosing one somewhat distant from Ms. Samuels, she doesn't need any more distractions than she already has.
 When you have a question, or need help from one of the tutors, flip the card over to the red side and place it on your desk."
 I nodded and headed over to a table near the girl, one where I could watch her without her seeing me.
 I wasn't going to fall all over myself to become her friend or anything, but I figured it was worth observing her for a little bit.
 If she really was cool then we might strike up a friendship at some point.

 That’s how it felt.” “You’re a lucky guy,” Eric said, in a more wistful tone than I had ever heard him use.
 Freedom
 Driving through Los Angeles, thinking is dangerous.
 An instant of distraction can get you killed.
 I turn off the I-pod and for some moments attend to driving.
 But I can’t give up remembering Eric, and memories I left behind long ago appear.
 I recall that I wrote my first complete story at Eric’s house.
 We had talked about the future.
 He hadn’t picked a career.

What?
 Oh yeah, I’ve been thinking about what you said about Eugene not being a name to inspire fear in the masses.
 Liz – (snickers) You can say that again, it’s almost as bad as Wesley in its ability to scare people.
 Unless you’re the person being named Eugene or Wesley, then it’s scary.
 Jim – What about it Gene?
 Eugene – Well I’m thinking of changing it to make it scarier…
 Jim – Oh God, here we go
 Eugene – …and since you have so many good ideas I could really use your help.
 Jim – What do you want?
 Something like ‘Eugene the Destroyer’?

We had killed him.
 And they were worried about my stupid binding?
 The circling cloaks from my dreams were back, filling my head.
 My thoughts were twisting, getting out of control.
 They’d be hunting us all down now.
 They would kill us.
 That was why I needed training.
 To protect myself.
 Because they intended to kill me, not capture.
 They intended to kill us all.

She wished that she could let them know that she was all right.
 And that someone was taking care of her.
 She'd only known Rick a week, but she already trusted him.
 More than she trusted Davis.
 Rick had kept his promise and come home at 5:30 every day, and he'd apologized for trying to kiss her.
 The last time she'd seen Davis, he'd kissed her so hard that her teeth had cut her lips.
 And he certainly hadn't apologized.
 She touched the ring that Davis had put on her left hand, twisting it.
 Could she spend her entire life with a man like that?

They played for fifty bucks a night, some beer, a little pussy.
 Early, early.
 There are names that aren’t even on the list, yet they made it all happen, for later cats, for B.
 B., for Furry, for Gatemouth.
 There’s this cat, Beaureguard somebody, played his whole life, man, his whole fucking life, lived in Midtown Memphis, played all the gigs there were back then—and we’re talking back in the Ur days, the days before electricity.
 And he lived to be, oh I don’t know, 117 or something ridiculous.
 Never made it, you know, never cut a record for Chess or whoever.
 But the music was important, it flowed through him, this cat.
 I saw him once, in a tent show—Furry was there—and he just blew everybody away, played with a broken bottle for a slide, old shitbox guitar—and he just blew everybody away.
 He’s in here man, in me, in all the cats who came after.

Suddenly he knew, and he looked at Aurelia in total disbelief.
 “Is that a book?”
 The elf nodded.
 “Is it a safe assumption that you don’t know how to read?”
 Harruq frowned at the book.
 “You’re not going to teach me elvish, are you?”
 Aurelia gave him a playful jab to the side.
 “No, it is in the gods’ language, your gods anyway.
 Karak and Ashhur got something right having humans speak and write the same language.”
 “What do you mean?”

But you…”
 Again that greedy look.
 “You are extraordinary.
 I do not have to give you unearned power.
 I must simply guide and instruct.” Velixar stood, and when his power flared, Qurrah fell to his knees and worshipped his new master.
 “You are what I have searched for all these years.
 You and I will destroy this world side by side.
 We will lay waste to all life and put absolute order upon every last soul.”
 “Teach me,” Qurrah said, his mouth buried into the dirt.
 “Show me the power I have sought for so very long.”

"You're very much a part of the family, and if I may be so bold, I'm quite delighted by your inclusion.
 I've not seen Mistress Rachel or Master Alec this content in more years than I like to think about.
 For my part, I hope to have the continued pleasure of your company for a very long time."
 I felt myself blushing.
 I hated how easily my face heated up, but a little thing like my imminent death was hardly going to change that.
 "Thanks, Donovan.
 Not just for that either.
 I haven't properly thanked you for how nice you've been to me."
 Donovan waved away my thanks.
 "That is no more or less than my duty to a member of the family, and with that, we've arrived."

Antonil glanced at the elf, who was painted in camouflage and still wore his wicked bow slung across his back.
 He sighed.
 “You’re right.
 I do know.”
 Silence followed.
 The two continued staring, each wishing to speak their mind but unable to summon the courage.
 “You are a wise man,” Dieredon said, breaking the moment.
 “You know who is in the right in this conflict, as do I.”
 “Yes, we both do,” Antonil agreed.
 He glanced to the elf, his face asking the question he could not voice.

Hopefully there I could safely find a niche among the other quasi-loners who didn't fit in anywhere else.
 As I turned my light out and got into bed I realized there'd been one bright spot to the day.
 Brandon Worthingfield III might not really be interested in me, but he was obviously at the top of the social food chain, and he'd already shown me way more attention than any of the boys back home ever had.
 Maybe there was some hope after all.
 ** I was lost, not just in the sense of not knowing where I was, but because I'd never been anywhere even remotely like this.
 The breeze was louder than any I'd ever heard before, and was laden with an unimaginable host of scents.
 It took me several seconds to sort through things enough to realize I was smelling things I didn't even have a name for.
 After several seconds of trying to catalog the most delightful of my new discoveries, I realized I'd had my eyes closed since I'd gotten here, possibly an unconscious defense mechanism meant to protect me from sensory overload.
 The distant sound of water trickling down a rock face, of leaves gently caressing each other in the breeze faded away as I took in an amazing wonderland of light.
 The trees I'd been listening to were exactly where I expected them to be, but it took me several heartbeats to recognize them.

Of course, even today women stayed with men who abused them, and it would have been much harder for a woman in the 1920s to escape.
 But why had she married him?
 Had she not seen what type of man he was?
 He turned back to the picture.
 The article had said that she’d been vibrant and fun-loving in her youth, and he could see those qualities in her eyes.
 He would have liked to have known her.
 Well, before her marriage, anyway.
 He’d bet that she’d been a lot less complicated than the women he knew.
 And she was so beautiful.
 Rick went to bed without having decided anything about an outfit for the dance.

And he did, man, he played what I was singing on a plastic tonette—no shit, that’s that weird, unearthly descant in the background, Jim on this little toy.
 It’s not in the credits, so you’re getting it first, right?
 And I just did my best Lou Reed impersonation, intoning, Her glances could break arms.
 Her hair was a nimbus of tangled nestings, life surrounded her like a cloak.
 When I went too deep she was quick to pull the plug.
 I still stay awake nights reliving the ignominy, forgetting to celebrate how we came together briefly, fiery angels.
 I think I was riffing, partly, adding to what I’d written, making it up as I went along.
 By that 16th run-through, my voice was tired anyway, and the guys were playing like they were drugged, and the song sounds like that.
 I love that cut, man.
 We hit some other place with that one.

He held out a hand to me.
 “What do you say we water the horses?” I didn’t have to ask my horse to kneel; Steed just grabbed my waist and threw me up.
 He was mounted before I had settled into the saddle and our horses took off, galloping north in synchronization.
 I looked back for Chevelle.
 He was leaning forward, legs nearly straight in the stirrups as his stallion raced to catch us.
 We were covering distance so quickly I could barely take in the new surroundings.
 It wasn’t long before we came up on a wide creek.
 I assumed Steed had control of my horse; I was simply concentrating on staying in the saddle as we ran beside him.
 The horses edged closer to the creek, splashing along the muddy bank and then the shallows of the water.
 Silt and cold water sprayed my face as we ran.

It’s code, man.
 But, you know, I don’t hide anything from my Love.
 I don’t know, I started out writing this song because I had fucked this chick, see, when I was on tour, when Lor was back here.
 And she sort of followed me around for a couple of gigs, and it was like a lost week, there, I was all screwed up.
 I wasn’t thinking about Lorelei or what this would mean to her, if anything.
 I just wanted to keep balling this chick, right?
 She was blond and willowy and looked like a pixie and I just couldn’t get enough of her.
 Some of my roadies, and Pete, man, God bless him, he was like ‘Buddy, drop this chick, she’s trouble, man.’  He was thinking of Lor.
 So, anyway, this beautiful woman followed me from city to city—she was a gypsy—and she dressed like a gypsy—I can’t tell you her name cuz you’d know it, man.
 Her heart is a legend.

I didn't know it was possible to blush and smile at the same time.
 "Nope, not sick."
 After such a beginning, my day could hardly be anything but great.
 One class after another rolled by, and all of the things that normally would've bothered me just went whipping past without managing to stick.
 I couldn't remember the second phase of cell division in Biology.
 I'd forgotten to reread the last chapter of Wuthering Heights, and Britney went out of her way to snub me.
 The only thing I cared about was making it to lunch so I could see Brandon again.
 I dawdled on my way to Algebra, so much so I was nearly late for class.
 It wasn't until I sat down at my desk and felt a wave of disappointment slither through me that I realized I'd been hoping to see Brandon in between classes.
 Mrs. Campbell caught me before I could leave for lunch.

His hair and eyes were a striking pale violet color, and his skin was a light nut color which made a strong contrast with his hair.
 This was highlighted by the similarly colored silk toga he wore.
 He wore no rings or accessories, his outfit simple, but extravagant.
 Van’dret suddenly wished he had thought to dress simpler for the occasion his green and emerald outfit with its gold trim seemed garish in comparison; and his human male form that normally seemed attractive and robust seemed ungainly and drab in comparison.
 Taiga’s manner continued to be friendly but inquisitive.
 The conversation started with a polite discussion on new spells that Van’dret was working on, and then moved to his thoughts on the recent political and economic tensions with the Romig Empire.
 Wine and food appeared on the table; Van’dret never saw it come, or the empty plates go.
 It simply was.
 The food, like everything in the tower, was of the finest quality.
 They were fed incredible grilled silver salmon, greens from the Northern Kingdoms, and small pastries from the Korin Islands.

A centering object, a holy thing.
 But he became a dream-figure, a part of my unconscious, as I understand the term.
 Is Bob Dylan more than a man?
 Is he more than a man with an extraordinary gift?
 Is he really something holy?
 Of course not.
 He is just an exceptional artist, a poet, a singer of peculiar power and persuasion and grace.
 So, what happened?
 What happens to any of us who find a particular artist who speaks to our very hearts?
 Is it right, just, meet?

This charge of self-pity, yeah, man, I’m on it, I dig.
 It’s right there on the album, if you really listened to it, if you listened with more than your ears, man.
 The repetition of “I’m crying”—almost three minutes of it, I know—it goes back to “I’m Gonna Sit Right Down and Cry Over You” and Lennon’s “I Want You.”  You know, you strip it down, you get right to the core phrase, the essential thing you wanna say—that’s what I’m getting at.

 The basement, the table is in the forefront now.
 Jim is still reading Sumo Assassin while lying on a couch at the edge of the stag.

Harruq patted his swords.
 “So be it.
 What’s the plan?”
 Qurrah could see two men positioned on either side of the campfire.
 They kept their backs to the fire and sat far enough away so their eyes would not fully adjust to its light.
 They camped within a sparse copse of trees, the trunks not nearly thick enough to hide their approach.
 “They are wise and alert,” he whispered.
 “Perhaps I can get close enough to cast a spell on one or two.
 They are on flat ground, so I see no way to ambush them.”
 “Then why don’t we just walk over, say hello, and then whack ’em?” Harruq asked.

It overlooked the Charles River, and when they left the club, they strolled along the river.
 It was a warm, clear April evening, a night right out of a romance novel.

 "For what?"
 "For this evening.
 It's been perfect."
 "I think so too.
 Well, almost."
 "Almost?"
 He stopped, turning to face her.

The material was thin, and they all had plunging necklines, and some were cut so that the edge of the leg hole was almost as high as the arm hole.
 But she managed to find two, one red and one black with pink flowers, that were less shocking than the others and took them to the dressing room.
 These weren't going to work.
 She'd chosen the two with the least amount of décolletage, and they still wouldn't work.
 They wouldn't completely hide her chest binding.
 She left the dressing room shaking her head.

The making of Turntable Poison was a liminal time, a time of congruity, or grand passion.
 The melding of the three (sometimes four) musicians was a Synchronicity.
 It can happen more than once but it happened at least once for Black Lung.
 It’s there on that vinyl circle, waiting for the needle like a junkie.
 And for anyone lucky enough to find that masterpiece in someone’s garage sale, in some second-hand record shop (where I hear it can go for upwards of a hundred dollars or more), at some friend’s apartment, there is knowledge passed.
 Because anyone who hears Turntable Poison hears right away what could have been, what should have been.
 What was.
 The album smokes.
 It tears down ceiling tiles.
 It disrupts fish in their blue aquarium lives.

 Words
 A single word can change our lives.
 Some years ago, I began to think hard about the word "love" as in "God is love" and in a challenge Sylvia Curtis made.
 Sylvia was an invalid, and rather crazy, given to dark moods and paranoid notions.
 She was the mother of my best friend Eric.

A blender?
 A microwave?"
 When her eyes grew larger with fear, he knelt beside her.
 "I won't hurt you, Marie.
 You don't know how to get back home, anyway.
 Just trust me a little."
 She didn't want to.
 But he was right--she didn't know how to get home.
 Slowly she rose, not taking the hand he extended but following him inside.
 "This is a microwave oven," he told her, patting a white and brown box.

 She patted the grass beside her.
 “Have a seat.

 Harruq grumbled as he plopped down.
 “My head is fine.”
 From behind her back, Aurelia pulled out a small blue object.
 “Ever seen one of these before?” she asked.
 The half-orc stared at it, thinking.
 Suddenly he knew, and he looked at Aurelia in total disbelief.

 He was being hunted; but hunted because he had finally dealt out justice.
 He had killed two monsters, two who wore faces not their own, and who he could feel no remorse for killing.
 Rodregas had finally escaped to his quiet place in the mountains to rest and, best of all, with two companions who seemed to be good people.
 Clearly, Doi’van had a dark side and he knew little of either of his companions.
 But it had been a long time since he had wanted to know more about anyone that he met.
 Rodregas had a new strong and powerful body, and he owed a great debt of guilt for that.
 He had even been able to free prisoners and give them a second chance at life.
 How many times had he dreamed of that while the prisoners had pleaded with him?

And how much worse would it have been if he'd been snatched away against his will?
 And unable to communicate with his family and friends?
 His heart began to ache for her.
 She had parents she loved, parents she knew were worried about her.
 She found everything here new and exciting, but there was a lot to be said for old and familiar.
 If she were home right now, she'd probably be sitting at her kitchen table with her mother planning a shopping trip or a luncheon or .

“Clever,” Dieredon whispered from atop Sonowin, watching the undead army’s departure.
 They circled back, returning to the Erze forest nestled around Woodhaven.
 Dieredon had returned too late to find and assault Velixar, so instead he had kept his troops hidden and waiting.
 The battle ended as he had hoped, and even Antonil had survived, Celestia be praised.
 The elf glanced back, memorizing the exact direction the undead marched.
 “Clever, and disgusting,” he added.
 “Death is nothing but a recruitment tool for you.”
 Half an hour later, he and a hundred other elves riding atop pegasi followed the necromancer north.
 As they flew, they passed over a small campfire dotting the empty field below.
 Their passage above went unheard and unseen, for the two lone souls sitting on opposite sides of that campfire were deep in conversation.

“Do we leave the bodies here?” Harruq asked.
 The necromancer trotted over to the dead noble and did not answer.
 Instead, he ruffled through the silk robes until he found a scroll marked with the seal of the king.
 Qurrah ripped it to shreds and let the pieces scatter in the wind, then he turned to his brother.
 “Do you remember what our Master wanted?”
 Harruq unsheathed Condemnation and nodded.
 “Aye, I do,” he said.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 When they returned to where Velixar waited, Harruq dropped the head of the noble.

Businesses employing fewer than 20 workers presently account for 57 per cent of new job creation in Europe.
 Based upon the successful examples of many developing countries that have stimulated growth in this sector, there is vast scope for expanding services to support new enterprises through better access to management and employee training courses, credit and R & D facilities; by testing and certification for those who want to start businesses; and by estab lishing business incubators to provide work space and shared services as well as technical, financial and marketing expertise to start-up companies.
 2.Reduce business failures: New businesses create most of the jobs, but they destroy most of them too, by going out of business.
 The failure rate of new businesses is extremely high in most industrial nations.
 In Italy, roughly 50 per cent fail in the first year.
 Of the more than 600,000 new business start-ups in the United States each year, 40 per cent close within 12 months, 80 per cent within five years, and 80 per cent of the remainder in the subsequent five years.
 Expanding programmes for management training, small business education and counselling, marketing assistance and financial management can bring down the failure rate dramatically.
 3.Voluntary part-timism: Increasing the flexibility of working hours will serve the interests of both businesses and workers.
 Encouraging voluntary part-timism by removing the artificial barriers to job sharing created by employment laws, social security tax laws, administrative procedures and trade unions would raise the morale and productivity of those who prefer to work less, while creating openings for many who are now without jobs.
 In the Netherlands, voluntary part-timism has been identified as the biggest single potential for creating new jobs, capable of reducing the country's unemployment by up to 50 per cent.

Gian Zet Foria.” Junnie.
 Junnie was chanting something.
 I was engulfed with an empty, lethargic feeling.
 My eyes batted open and I was lying on the ground, looking up at Junnie and Chevelle.
 Junnie’s words ran together as Chevelle mumbled.
 “Gian Zet Foria Gian Zet Foria Gian Zet Foria.” It seemed so familiar.
 Like Georgiana, Suzetta, Glaforia.
 They stopped simultaneously.
 “Frey.” Junnie was talking slowly.
 “Stay calm and lie still.” I tried to convey my incredulity as I lay there, unable to move.

He knelt as his head swirled.
 “Thank you, master.”
 “None are more deserving,” Qurrah said, putting an arm on his brother’s shoulder.
 “There is one, and it is you, Qurrah,” Velixar said.
 He pulled out one item more before closing the chest and shrinking it back to its original size.
 In his hand remained a long black whip that curled about as if alive.
 “Weapons may not be your preference, but I trust you will find some use for this.”
 As both brothers watched, the whip burst into flame.
 Velixar cracked it once to the grass, instantly charring the green earth into ash.
 “Why?” Qurrah asked.

"That was almost as quick as normal."
 Alec nodded in response to Mallory's observation.
 "I've been lifting weights for a while, but present circumstances dictated a more aggressive program."
 He opened the door to the pantry, and started putting cans away, but Mallory waved him off.
 "You'll put them in the wrong spots.
 Just leave that, and I'll put it away later.
 Don't go all mulish on me, I may be old and feeble, but I'm still able to move a can of food.
 Come over here and let me look at you."
 Alec came back towards us with an air of resignation.
 Mallory tenderly accepted the letter he produced from a pocket somewhere, and then waited while Alec knelt in front of her.

I was wearing light brown hunting boots and tight black pants made out of some sort of light cloth.
 A thick woven jacket was shielding me from the October cold.
 When I looked back at Seth, I realized he had also made an outfit change.
 He was wearing black leather boots and dark blue pants.
 His top was a short, brown cloak with a hood and leather belt.
 A beautiful steel sword with an ornamental hilt was swinging at his side from a woven sheath.
 “Oh well, I guess I have green hair.
 It’s not that bad.
 I like green.” I rambled as I examined the short hunting knife that was resting in a small sheath on my hip.
 I ran a finger over the blade before putting it back.

“I understand.”
 “Good.
 Now come.” The two resumed traveling up the small hill.
 They stopped again, however, for from their vantage point they could see the village.
 “See the torches?” Harruq asked, pointing.
 His brother nodded.
 “Velixar’s nightmares have pulled them from their slumber.
 It would be too easy otherwise.”
 “It’s going to be easy anyway,” Harruq said, drawing his blades.
 The soft red glow splashed across their faces.

I always found it ignorant when someone would advise me how to raise my child when they had no children at all or they had children younger than mine.
 The most absurd statements begin with the words “my children will never."
 I never offered advice to any parent, and I never welcomed a statement about raising my children that began with the words “you should.” I have always tried to be the best dad I could be, because it was up to me to make their upbringing different than mine.
 I coached their soccer, baseball and football teams for many seasons.
 I walked my boys to school, helped with their homework (as much as I could) and I tried to be an important part of their lives as well as a positive influence.
 As I continued to succeed in business, our lifestyle improved.
 Throughout their childhoods, we’ve had a good life and a beautiful home, nice cars, good communities, and the best of schools.
 I encouraged their interests by making sure they had the equipment they needed to pursue them.
 For instance, when Brandon showed a real interest in and talent for photography, he received his dream camera for Christmas.
 I have loved my wife and I have shown my children that I love them.

She laughed.
 “Well, yes.
 A little cold for lake bathing here.” She led me to a large basin in the corner of her room.
 Water streamed in from the window and filled it halfway.
 “I’ve laid out some clothes for you and there are some lovely soaps on the table.” She spun and glided out of the room, closing the door behind her, and all I could think was, Lovely soaps.
 I examined the room as I undressed.
 A large bed topped with decorated pillows and colorful blankets centered the opposite wall, twice the size of the one I’d been using.
 A tall rack in the corner was draped with materials—deep violet and emerald-green silks, dark wools, and a rainbow of patterned scarves.
 Shelves alongside were filled full with curiosities and a few books lay on the bedside table near a lantern.
 I stepped into the tub, sinking down as lavender-scented steam rose to dampen my face and hair.

"So Alec wasn't kidding when he said it wasn't safe for me to be here?"
 "You're probably not in any more danger today than you were that first night.
 Jessica isn't any fonder of you now than she was then.
 I've been working with James every day since then, but he hasn't really come around yet, so he is still a bit of a problem.
 Luckily, with Alec and Isaac both firmly on your side, and Jasmin starting to develop a liking for you, there isn't a thing those two can really do about it.
 As long as Alec is very careful to stay between the two of them and you, you really don't have a reason to worry."
 "He let you get close to me."
 Dom's smile was incredibly winning.
 "Ah, but Donovan was still with you, and not only do I like you more than any of the others, I'm also a cat, so in this case my instincts aren't quite as worrisome."
 "You're different from the others then?

On the other hand, if the forces of the guild came after him… The guardsmen of the Immortalist guild were known as the Immortal Guards and their reputation as the premier fighters of the realm was seldom questioned.
 If they found out what had happened at Raven Keep there was not much chance for Rodregas’ survival.
 After a simple meal, a good rub down for the horses and a few hours of rest, Rodregas got the wagon back on the road.
 If he could keep up this pace, up he could be well hidden before any forces could find him.
 At the end of the second day, before he had come to his last turn off, he realized that he would have to get some sleep.
 He was feeling exhausted.
 His body might be surprisingly strong and quick but apparently it still needed to sleep on a regular basis.
 As soon as the horses were fed, rubbed down, hobbled and left to graze, Rodregas unrolled Captain Poir’s mattress and collapsed into it with a welcome sigh.
 Sleep came to him almost instantly.
 In Rodregas’ life he had experienced several very unpleasant ways of waking up, but this was the worst: a searing hot pain stabbed into his stomach!

I could get you five points there even with a regular bow, otherwise I am happy to watch you big boys show how tough and strong you are.” Rodregas smiled at Doi’van’s and Imeralda’s courage even though their personalities were opposites.
 Imeralda was as light hearted as Doi’van was thoughtful.
 “One question,” Rodregas asked, “do we actually have a hammer or a mace?”
 Two days later the dawn found Rodregas facing his first opponent.
 This first foe looked very young.
 He nodded to him like Rodregas should know him.
 Rodregas wondered if this man had been a friend of the previous occupant of his new body?
 He looked like he might speak, but Rodregas simply shook his head.

"It's you, Adri.
 Of course it's beautiful."
 For a second I couldn't breathe.
 It seemed so utterly impossible.
 Maybe it could've been a painting of Cindi, but not one of me.
 I couldn't possibly be the gorgeous figure he'd brought to life on his canvas.
 I opened my mouth to protest, and then the expression on her face finally registered for me.
 Compassion.
 Acceptance of the viewer, combined with an obvious desire to mend grievous hurts.
 It was exactly how I remembered feeling.

“I was never given his name,” Qurrah said.
 His voice, already soft and quiet, grew even quieter.
 “He was Master.
 That was all that mattered.”
 “Tell me of your time with Master,” Velixar ordered.

 “I was his slave.
 I cleaned up after him while he fed me scraps of his failed experiments.
 I slept in a cage.
 One time he caught me practicing words of magic.

Billy Graham quoted from a Bible prophet, in a manner that made me feel prophesied to.
 He commanded, Learn to do well, relieve the oppressed and the fatherless, plead for the widow.
 Come now, he said, and let us reason together.
 Though our sins are as scarlet, they can be as white as snow.
 If only we’re willing and obedient, we can reap the good of the land.
 And he warned us.
 The hydrogen bomb had cast its shadowy threat of annihilation over the whole earth.
 Sooner than we imagined, the basic power of the universe would be given into the hands of mad men.
 Then, how could our planet avoid destruction?
 And he told us a Chicago judge claimed our generation’s teenaged criminals made Al Capone's gang look like a Sunday school class.

The realization hit with such force that it distracted me from the familiarity of the signature.
 The new pieces were all breathtaking.
 The drab colors were gone, leaving scenes made up of multi-hued strands of light.
 It was like waking up and having someone tell you they'd been reading your mind.
 The pieces weren't of specific places or events from my dreams, but they were an exact match for how they'd looked and felt.
 I felt my hands start to shake.
 It was like I'd had too much forced on me too quickly.
 I wanted to just collapse and let unconsciousness overcome me, but something pulled me onward towards the next series of pictures, and then the next after that.
 I wanted to stop.
 Each piece opened up another fragment of my soul, revealing a new pain that I'd kept hidden for the last few months.

He would make them both pay.
 The tip of a sword pressed against the side of his neck, drawing blood from the slightest pressure.
 “He looks mad,” said the guard.
 “Died fighting us, don’t that sound right?”
 Every muscle in Harruq’s body tensed, knowing his moment to act would need to be perfect.
 Before he could, a feminine voice shouted down the alley, startling all three.
 “Both of you, stop that this instant!”
 Through blurred vision, Harruq saw a woman with auburn hair standing at the edge of the alley.
 The patrolmen also turned to look, their weapons still in hand.
 “Who the abyss…‌oh, go on back to your forest, Aurelia.

Eugene – Ok, this time I’m going to crush you!
 I mean it, no holding back!
 Johnny – Right.
 Eugene – You’re going to be humiliated.
 I didn’t play with my fullest potential before.
 Johnny – Uh-huh
 Eugene – Just remember when its all over that it’s just a game, don’t get suicidal or anything.
 I mean I was kind of hungry, but now that we’ve eaten I don’t have anything to distract me from handing out the beat-down.
 Johnny – Will do.
 Eugene – Its going to be bad for you, maybe we shouldn’t play it’ll save you a lot pain.

Think they bought it?"
 I tried to inject the proper amount of blonde stupidity into my words, but wasn't sure it worked until I felt Alec's arms tighten almost painfully around me.
 I gasped, and he set me down so quickly I almost fell over.
 Before I'd even regained my balance, he was walking away, moving so quickly I would've needed to run to keep up.
 Even so, he hadn't turned away quick enough to hide the complete disdain in his expression.
 I suddenly found myself wishing I'd told him the truth rather than making him think I was stupid and manipulative.
 It was too late.
 He was already out of sight, and by now his opinion of me was fixed.
 Chapter 4 School hadn't gotten any worse after I'd convinced the hottest boy on the planet that I was a complete waste of oxygen, but it hadn't gotten any better either.
 Mrs. Tiggs, my Spanish teacher, had seemed every bit as mean as my Biology teacher from earlier in the day, and it had been a relief when Britney had finally dropped me off at home.

My eyes widened as I saw Seth and then darkness.
 But not before the voice said one more thing.
 “Beware of each other.” *** I opened my eyes and shot up so fast my head collided with Seth's.
 I clutched my head and said, “Ow.” Seth stretched his arm to rub his eyes.
 “What's wrong?” he asked.
 I shook my head.
 “Nothing.” I looked at the beads of sweat on his forehead.
 “What's wrong with you?” “Nothing,” he said.
 “I'm just hot because when someone sleeps on someone else, that person kind of gets hot.” “What do you mean?” He shook his arm.
 “You fell asleep leaning against my arm.

I had a good time."
 "So did I."
 Rick opened her car door.
 "If you were into racquetball, I'd invite you out for a couple of games tomorrow.
 How about tennis--do you like tennis?"
 "Afraid not.
 I'm not much of an athlete."
 "How about brunch and a movie then?"
 "That sounds great."
 Rick felt good about the evening and was looking forward to seeing Sharon again the next day.

Rick wanted to do much more than kiss her, and she was making it difficult to resist.
 He'd never held a woman so eager, so responsive to his slightest touch.
 But he had to stop.
 He had to stop now.
 He raised his head, straightening and pulling away.
 But Marie clung to him, rubbing her face against his neck.
 "Kiss me again, please," she murmured, raising her head to press her lips to his.
 He couldn't resist her, and his mouth began moving over hers again.
 But at last he forced himself to break away.
 "Marie, we have to stop," he told her, literally holding her at arm's length.

The silence wasn't as comfortable now.
 I had to break it, even if it meant further examining all of the holes inside me that I'd spent so many months struggling to ignore.
 "So you're just one of those guys that can't resist trying to help the broken girls, huh?"
 "No.
 That's Dominic's theory, I didn't say it was mine.
 I did what I did because when I close my eyes I still see you there."
 My heart jumped up to my throat, but in a good way.
 "I don't know why, not really.
 Your incredible, unearthly beauty helps, as does your stubborn determination to continue soldiering on, despite how badly you've been hurt.
 That doesn't explain it all though.

"What are you looking at, freak?"
 It was hard to believe Vincent could be so nonchalant after having almost killed someone.
 It'd been an accident obviously, but still that wasn't the kind of thing you just shook off.
 All of the kids that'd been rushing forward to congratulate Isaac for his heroic save started backing away.
 Anxious to avoid the fight, I tried to move with the crowd, but felt a flash of pain as my abused ankle protested.
 For a second I couldn't think about anything other than the agony.
 When I managed to get my eyes to focus again, Vincent was only a couple of inches away from Isaac and hissing something too quiet for me to make out.
 Whatever it was, Vincent was all but foaming at the mouth while Isaac was so controlled it was hard to believe a fight was about to break out.
 As admirable as Isaac's calm was, I was actually wishing he was a little more worked up.
 I'd seen plenty of fights where the guy who got the first hit in won.

Whew, no need to go through the third degree about Brandon.
 "Anything promising, Mom?"
 "Hmm?
 I don't know.
 Maybe one or two will be okay once I've touched them up, but this brochure is proving tougher than expected.
 Can we talk after dinner?"
 By now I really should have been used to Mom ignoring me when she got buried in a project.
 I shrugged and went upstairs to change.
 Hours later, having finished up all my homework and endured the agony of dinner, I was finally free to do whatever I wanted with the last few minutes of my night.
 My room was still miserable, but with Mom sitting down in the living room with her laptop going through the gigs of data that she'd shot over the last few days, it offered the only real chance at some time alone.

Van’dret almost felt his eye brows rise, “of course, but what should I watch out for?
 I heard it was just some sort of accident.
 I was not aware that any of the Knights of the Order were implicated.” Taiga smiled and waved a hand in a dismissing motion.
 “Oh, don’t misjudge my words.
 I did not mean to imply any misdeeds of our valiant Knights of the Soaring Heavens.
 I am not aware of any of them doing much of anything, much less kill an Immortalist.” “Than what should I keep my eye out for?” asked Van’dret.
 He was becoming even more curious to the direction of the conversation.
 “You, my fine Van’dret, are more in the world than most of us.
 You are out traveling and adventuring, while most of us Immortalist just sit in our towers.
 I have always thought that our one weakness was our isolation.

“Huh,” Harruq said.
 “You may have to tell me the story sometime.
 Are you one of the elves that were there way back then?”
 She gave him a wink.
 “No, but my father was.
 I’m not _that_ old, Harruq.
 In elven terms, I am but a child.”
 “How old a child?” he prodded.
 “Seventy.”
 “ _Seventy?_ ”

Luckily for Rodregas, there was a turn off almost immediately that let him circle around the edge of town and then start heading out of the valley.
 He went north toward the town of Cruet.
 As dusk was falling there was little traffic.
 Luckily this part of the road was well cleared and open and the horses were fresh so he made headway even as it became dark.
 He pushed hard until he reached the fork that headed west up into the hills.
 It was seldom traveled by anyone except fur trappers.
 Rodregas pushed on through the night and into the sunrise of the next day until even the horse that had been Korin’s ride, which he had tied to the back of the wagon, seemed to be tired and ready for rest.
 He stopped and let the animals take a break next to a small creek.
 Rodregas was not sure what would happen when the relief guards went to the tower and found the other guards tied up, apparently by Ravenhurr himself.
 His assistant had been killed in the Master’s own room.

Torches lit each walkway and building.
 It seemed late, but several villagers were still outside, loud and boisterous.
 Nearly everyone dressed in black, a few of the men bearing large silver breastplates or wrist cuffs.
 Most wore leather, laced tight against thick, muscled frames.
 Few were thin or as petite as the elves I was used to seeing.
 These were strong, like Chevelle and Steed.
 All had dark hair as well.
 And then there was red hair.
 Ruby.
 I cursed.

The next few days Rodregas and Doi’van recovered quickly under the powerful healing magic of Jordaan.
 This is not to say Rodregas did not spend most of his time dreaming that the handsome young Nymph would head back to his own estates.
 They were staying in a small village that seemed to be mostly a forest with small rooms built into it.
 Rodregas could not figure out any set pattern to the place or its boundaries.
 There might have been a dozen or even hundreds of Nymphs living there.
 Though all the Nymphs were friendly, he was still eager to leave.
 Jordaan was doing one of his mystic checks, running his hand a foot above Rodregas’ reclining body.
 Occasionally, his hand seemed to be moving in the air like a baker making bread.
 “Well,” Rodregas finally said, “I feel fine now and I thank you for your healing, but I think I am ready to leave.” Jordaan nodded.
 His face held his usual expression of good cheer.

I turned towards her to respond and just broke down.
 She pulled me into an open classroom and gave me a hug while I tried to explain about the two failed tests, my birthday, and how much I missed my Dad and Cindi.
 The last bit was especially garbled.
 I was pretty sure she wasn't getting any of it, but that didn't matter.
 All that mattered was I was finally able to tell someone.
 I never really got myself under control; my sobs just subsided enough for me to tell Rachel I wanted to go home.
 Isaac was standing right outside the classroom door, and unobtrusively helped Rachel get me to his car where she jumped into the back with me.
 Even through the haze of tears I could tell he wasn't happy about the seating arrangement, but once again Rachel showed the kind of iron will she'd demonstrated with James.
 Almost before I knew it we were rolling to a stop in my driveway.
 I fumbled, for the latch, but Rachel put a hand on my arm before I could get the door open.

My sword.
 I knew what to do then.
 I took a deep, steadying breath as I raised the blade to the air.
 There was a faint pause, the briefest tick before the bird took flight, its wings hitting wind as the shift began, and then nothing could be heard but my name, roared in the song of the crowd below.

Psychologically, the right attitudes, values and motives enable the individual to attain a self-existent happiness and inner harmony which nothing can disturb.
 This knowledge too can be consciously formulated and communicated through the educational system of the twenty-first century.
 Mentally, our knowledge is partial, biased and largely dependent on social status and opinion, rather than purely rational criteria.
 True mental objectivity can be taught.
 Human fulfilment in the twenty-first century depends on our ability to provide an education that imparts not only material facts, but also the mental perspectives, psychological attitudes, personal values, individual skills and organizational abilities needed for the full blossoming of human resourcefulness and ac complishment.
 Developing Skills
 Improving the quality and quantity of productive skills is essential to implementing the strategies for peace, democratization, food security, economic growth and full employment set forth in this report.
 The phenomenal growth of East Asian countries is the direct result of their massive investments in upgrading the skills of the workforce.
 Rather than generating excess workers, rising productivity has generated greater demand for labour.
 Labour productivity in South Korea rose 11 per cent per year between 1963 and 1979, mostly due to investment in education and skills.

Dylan, The Beatles, they led the way.
 They said, you know, show us the plan, you don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.
 And the kids sat up and listened.
 It was coming, this revolution of meaning, this concentration on the word.
 And, all along, behind it like a dark river, ran the beat, the melody, a sort of communication device that was both insidious and right out there in the open.
 See, rock wasn’t subversive to the people who wanted to know.
 It didn’t trick anybody.
 It’s the most godawful honest music on the planet.
 In the end, I think that’s what has kept it so powerful, its honesty, its lack of guile.
 CM:  	Tell me more about what changed your direction.

Marie exclaimed breathlessly when she returned to Rick.

 "I saw."
 He smiled, stroking a damp tendril of hair from her face.
 "Was it fun?"
 "It was incredible!
 I can't believe I danced with him!"
 "Come sit down for a minute and have a Coke."
 He managed to keep her still for less than five minutes.

Recognizing that the problem of food was inextricably intertwined with the problems of peace, political and social stability, and employment, and that no comprehensive solution to one was possible without substantial progress on the others, it was our hope and intention that this growing consensus on food could be harnessed to accelerate progress on arms control and disarmament.
 Ironically, events have unfolded in the reverse sequence.
 Rapid progress has been made during the intervening years to reduce international tensions, but little has yet been done effectively to address the food issue.
 Now that opportunity is before us and compels us to act, for without significant progress on abolishing hunger from the earth, our efforts at arms control and peace making may come to naught.
 Increasing the availability of food and jobs form essential components of a comprehensive strategy to eradicate hunger, poverty and violence from the world.
 Food Security
 Despite great achievements in the post-war period, we live in a world of persistent hunger amidst plenty.
 Presently, around 800 million people living in 46 countries are malnourished and 40,000 die every day of hunger and hunger-related diseases.
 Widespread famine currently threatens nine African countries, where the lives of 20 million people are at risk.
 Hunger and famine are usually associated with a physical shortage of food.

Surely you have seen them.
 Slip past their defenses and wait.
 When the battle comes, slaughter the elves from behind.
 You must weaken them enough so that Vaelor’s army has a chance at victory.”
 “We will not fail,” Qurrah promised.
 “Where will we meet you?”
 “Listen for where the screams are at their worst,” Velixar said as his shadow began to fade.
 “There shall I be.”
 A pale hand reached inside his robes and pulled out five glass vials.
 Qurrah knelt and accepted the gifts.

Marie started to reach for him again, but then her eyes narrowed.
 Pushing against his chest so hard that he stumbled back, she whirled and stormed off into the fog.
 How dare he!
 How dare he use his kisses to try to keep her from going home!
 It was already hard enough just to look at him in the morning before she walked in the garden.
 He knew that whenever they kissed, she didn't want to stop, that she'd kiss him forever.
 Just last night he'd told her that they couldn't kiss like that unless they got married.
 And this morning he dared to kiss her that way, knowing that it would make her all but forget her walk!
 When she returned to the house nearly half an hour later, she stormed past him and up to her room.
 Rick knew for sure that she was mad this time, knew why, and knew he'd been wrong to do what he'd done.

 Eugene – It’s not like anything else goes on here for the stations to report.
 Cleo – I’ll bet that those sorrow peddlers are overjoyed for a fire on Thanksgiving.

 Eugene – Yeah.
 Liz – Oh Johnny.

Similar arguments were made in the past against complete eradication of chemical weapons.
 The new treaty for the abolition of chemical weapons provides a useful model.
 Chemical weapons technology is far easier to acquire and violations of the treaty are far more difficult to verify.
 The fact that a comprehensive universal treaty to abolish one category of weapons of mass destruction is now a reality proves that political will rather than technical factors is the crucial element.
 The Chemical Weapons Treaty also shows that negotiation of such a treaty need not take decades.
 The demise of the Cold War offers a unique opportunity to eliminate nuclear weapons while the political atmosphere is favourable.
 If the world now intends to uphold democracy and human rights as inalienable values, then the human right to live without the threat of a nuclear holocaust must be proclaimed and made inviolable.
 A durable non-proliferation regime can only be constructed on the basis of the universal abolition of nuclear weapons.
 Manufacture and possession of nuclear weapons must be banned.
 Use of such weapons must be outlawed as a crime against humanity.

 Investment in education and training helped Thailand raise labour productivity by 63 per cent during 1980–5.
 It, too, is moving from a labour surplus to a labour shortage economy.

Books stacked in these tottering towers.
 Names I’d never heard of, at that time: Kis, Malcolm Lowry, Svevo, Madame Blavatsky, Fludd, Dee, Goncharov, Bruno Schulz, Philip Wylie, Whatsername Yates, Blake, Maturin, Borges, Marie-Louise von Franz,  a book called History of Secret Societies, one, I think called On the conjuring of angels.
 It was mind-boggling.
 The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage.
 I felt like I was in a secret underground lab, a lab for the soul.
 It was trippy, a mindfuck, you know, but beautiful.
 And this woman, this witchy, beautiful woman embodied all this stuff, she was her surroundings, her home, her personal halidom.
 And she stood there, as silent as the grave, watching me, and, finally—I was dizzy—I turned back to her.
 And she looked like the answer to every question I’d ever had.
 Her breasts seemed, particularly, to invite me, to suckle there, to be born again.

You’ve saved my life.
 If it weren't for you, I'd be marrying Davis and dying in 14 years.”  She shuddered at the thought.
 Snuggling up closer to him, she sighed.
 “If it weren’t for you, I'd have no idea that it's possible to be so comfortable with a man.
 And your kisses .
 .
 ."
 She blushed just thinking about how they made her feel.
 He kissed her lips softly.
 "Do you know what my life was like before you came?

Let me and Doi’van get in close.” She hesitated, but nodded and handed her dagger to him.
 Doi’van pounded past the two and picked Van’dret off the ground, by the front of his robes, and gave him a backhanded slap across the face.
 It was with enough power to have snapped a normal man’s neck, but Van’dret looked more startled than hurt.
 “Gag him and don’t let him move his fingers,” said Imeralda.
 Even as Doi’van nodded he slapped his open palm against Van’dret’s mouth and used his other hand to grab one of the sorcerer’s free hands.
 Rodregas grabbed the other.
 “Put him on the ground and kneel on him,” Rodregas said to Doi’van.
 The Hellborn nodded and pushed the sorcerer down on the cold stone ground.
 He next straddled the man with his knees, pining his shoulders.
 “I am going to ask him a few questions.

My wife woke to my screaming and she was as shocked as I was when I showed her the test results.
 Brandon had to want to get better.
 As he packed his meager belongings, I grabbed the hand held video player and replayed the footage I had taped of him detoxing.
 He begged me to stop the video as he could hear himself on it screaming in agony as his body craved this drug.
 Brandon was crying uncontrollably as he tried to look away from the video that I continued to shove in front of his face.
 Lisa stood there pale and exhausted, frightened like the night of his intervention.
 As I remember it, she resembled my mother, so many years before, when we visited Thomas in prison.
 Lisa could not add even a word.
 Brandon left our home with little in his hands and got into what was once a nice little car, but was now something appropriate for a salvage yard with body damage, a driver’s door that wouldn’t open, and water leaking through missing door seals.
 Brandon had to get in from the passenger side of this wreck of a car, symbolic of his wreck of a life.

“Good morning.” She was wearing only his pajama top and looked unbelievably sexy.
 Drawing her close, he bent his head and kissed her.
 Marie sighed with pleasure as she returned Rick’s kiss.
 She’d never dreamed anything could make her feel this way.
 “Are you hungry?” he asked, kissing the tip of her nose.
 “Starved.”  She hugged him.
 They went downstairs with their arms around each other.
 “Did you make pancakes?” she asked.
 “Yeah.
 I’m starved, and I figured you would be too.

I bet they’re probably wondering…” “No way,” I cut in.
 “I’m not leaving until I get my answer.” Seth traced the dirt with the end of a stick.
 “You say I’m stubborn” I laughed and he continued, “Listen, I don’t even know if it’s true or not.
 There’s no need for me to worry any of you.
 That’s why I didn’t say anything.” “I still don’t care, Seth.” I said.
 He made a face, “Jazell I really don’t know if I should say anything…” I interrupted him again, “Seth just give up trying to talk me into not listening.
 It’s a waste of breath.” I took my own stick and threw it at him.
 He ducked, of course, and it landed on the ground.
 “What if whatever you’re not telling us happens and we never knew?
 How would that help anyone?” He looked down and mumbled something that sounded like, “You couldn’t help.” When he looked back up he said, “Fine you win, I’ll tell you.” He didn’t sound happy about it.

“I was just, um, I never got a chance to thank you.” Harruq felt his face flush.
 This was the most awful thing he had ever done.
 He’d prefer to face a dragon in unarmed combat.
 He’d have better odds surviving, too, based on Aurelia’s cold, steeled look.
 “You came all the way out here to thank me?
 Hardly sounds like an orcish thing to do.”
 One would not have thought gray skin could turn so red, but it did.
 “Well, I still want to repay you.” Harruq held out a small bag containing copper coins.
 “It’s all I have.
 Please, take it.”

I walked slowly and leaned forward to see the symbol.
 Amazingly, I walked right up to the one with an arrow on it.
 I looked to the left and saw a door with a sword on it.
 I sighed and pushed open my door.
 The small room also had glass ceilings but they were dimmer.
 The room was dark and cold, with dust in the air.
 “I was wondering when you would get here,” a familiar voice said.
 I jumped and looked into one of the corners.
 The girl from my dreams walked out, shimmering.
 She smiled and I then noticed the bow hanging on her back with a quiver of arrows.

and he knew that there were even softer places to touch.
 He also knew she was on fire.
 She would let him touch her any way he wanted, and all she'd do would be moan and grow hotter.
 With his arm around her shoulders, he eased her down onto the sofa.
 She writhed beneath his weight, moaning.
 She'd never be able to leave him once they'd made love.
 His mouth ravaged hers as he pressed her deeper into the cushions.
 Panting, he raised his head and pulled back enough to unbutton her blouse.
 Marie gazed up into his eyes.
 "I love you, Rick."

Silly.
 I did my best to comfort Britney after that, but was more than a little relieved when lunch finally ended.
 That of course made me feel heartless and guilty in turn, but I was still too fragile to deal with her issues.
 When it's all you can do to get through the day yourself, it's impossible to be a pillar of strength for someone else.
 History was a complete waste of time.
 I hadn't even made it through the reading assignment, and I still got a perfect score on the pop quiz.
 Physics was surprisingly full.
 Apparently Alec was the only hard-core party animal in the class.
 I was still feeling weird from Britney's story, so unlike the rest of my classmates, who seemed genuinely intrigued by the assignment, I just pretended to leaf through a reference book all hour.
 Spanish was as bad as history.

Qurrah reached into his pocket, clutching a few pieces of bone.
 Before he could draw them out the elf spoke, his voice soft and sad.
 “Too much death this day,” he said.
 “For hundreds of years my brother and I lived here, and for hundreds of years more we would have remained.
 He is dead now, and for what reason?”
 “Death has no reason,” Qurrah said, his whole body tensing.
 “No,” the elf said, turning around so he could stare at Qurrah eye to eye.
 “But murderers do.”
 Neither moved.
 Neither spoke.

He had five targets and five arrows.
 He shot at the target shaped like a man.
 The arrow sailed over its right shoulder.
 Rodregas started to tense up, but knew that would kill any chances of hitting his next targets.
 He released the second arrow at the crouching man and the arrow hit low to the left, but he did hit the target.
 He nailed the next standard target almost in the middle, but missed the last two completely.
 Rodregas was among those who were first out of this round of the tournament and spent the rest of the day watching the archery competition.
 The only relief he felt was that only one of the other winners with the yellow ribbons on their arm also gained a second one.
 He found out his name was Geriodon.
 Rodregas also saw that two others who had the white second place ribbons from the day before also earned white ribbons in the day’s contest.

Never would he have guessed that those two blades would shatter his own, pass through the explosion of steel, sever his spine, and cleave his body in two.
 The half-orc continued his charge, engaging the two elves behind.
 They struck as one, their swords aiming for vitals high and low.
 Harruq knew he could not block both, so he accepted a thrust curving to the side of his armor, grinning darkly.
 As the sword punched through the enchanted leather, the half-orc cut his adversary’s throat, using that same swing to parry the other attack away.
 The remaining elf swore as his eyes grew red and watery.
 He backed away from the half-orc, his sword held defensively before him.
 “What demon magic is this?” he asked.
 “Mine,” said Qurrah.
 And then blood poured out from the face of the lone elf.

1.The concept of 'peace dividend' should be expanded to include manpower, educational and training capabilities, scientific and technological resources, production facilities, land and abandoned military bases that can be redeployed to combat rural and urban poverty as well as national and global environmental degradation.
 An inventory of these resources should be compiled and efforts made to identify alternative uses through the UN's specialized agencies and by national governments.
 All nations should advise the Secretary General of the human, technological and produc tive resources they are willing and able to place at the disposal of the UN.
 2.Each government should draw up an inventory of its military manpower, science, technology and other facilities which could be used to sustain the natural resource base, prevent environmental degradation and cooperate with other countries in combating regional and global threats to environmental security.
 The information should be shared with the UN Environmental Programme and the Sustain able Development Council.
 In each case it will be necessary to show how action implemented by the military will be more cost-effective than using traditional resources.
 3.A UN International Force for Development should be constituted under a democratized UN structure, consisting of demobilized military personnel and young professionals from different countries, which will be trained and equipped to promote people-centred, environmentally sound development initiatives that integrate political, social, economic and cultural factors.
 4.Global security is threatened by mass population movements, potential changes in sea levels, drought and famine.
 Greater international cooperation is needed in the sharing of national military manpower, under the auspices of a new UN Earth corps.
 Article 43 of the UN Charter, which was originally drawn up for dealing with the threat of conventional war, can be interpreted to apply to threats to environmental security as well.

Educated unemployment is a direct result of a system that fosters obedience and rote learning rather than individual initiative and creative thinking.
 A new system of development education needs to be introduced at all levels to equip the student with an understanding of his/her society, its achievements and potentials, and the opportunities open to each individual to participate in its future growth.
 The index of its success will be the extent to which students of this curriculum seek self-employment rather than salaried jobs.
 Fifth, minimum and average educational levels should be raised in all countries.
 Two centuries ago education was a luxury of the rich and it was simply inconceivable that every member of the population in any country could receive even a minimum level of education.
 Few of the industrial nations fully meet their own present minimum standards for every citizen.
 These minimums are arbitrary, not optimal.
 Raising the minimum levels of achievement further in all countries may be the most important initiative that governments can render to prepare their citizens for a more productive, prosperous and peaceful future.
 Sixth, new educational systems must be evolved to prepare people for life in the twenty-first century.
 Education imparts knowledge of the past and the general ability to deal with the future, but this ability is only in potential.

 If you were mine, I'd leave the office every evening as soon as I could.
 If you were mine, I would want to spend every minute of every day with you, and I'd want to hold you every chance I got.
 If you were mine--"   He stopped, realizing how agitated he was getting and how chagrined Marie looked.
 "I'm sorry," he told her.
 "I didn't mean to get so excited.
 I just really care about you, and I don't want you to mistake infatuation for love and end up hurt."
 They finished their yogurt in silence.
 Rick threw their napkins away, and they began wandering toward the mall exit.

It only took another ten minutes to explain the Pythagorean theory to her.
 By the time I stood up from Jackie's desk, there were only four of us left.
 Britney was staring sullenly at her book.
 I thought about going over and seeing if she needed any help, but after helping Jackie I was feeling pretty good.
 I turned and headed back to my desk, smiling at Rachel as I passed.
 "Adri, do you have a sec?"
 The deadly nickname.
 Apparently I'd only thought I was doing better.
 The good feeling I'd gotten from helping Jackie had just been the deceptive crust of ice hiding the sub-zero deathtrap below.

It seemed impossible that it could have ever have been anything but a garage.
 Chapter 3: The Set Up The lights of another car coming over the bridge do not belong to either vehicle I am expecting, so I examine the occupants.
 It is a man and his wife about my age so I look away quickly as to not draw attention to myself.
 I know I’ve got to wait patiently, as this drug deal is important to me and my family.
 I need it to happen.
 Another thing hasn’t changed about drug deals in all the years since my last: Buyers are always late to arrive and usually short on cash with lame excuses throughout the process.
 I am expecting $2500 in cash as agreed and I hope that the deal goes smoothly so I can go home safely to my wife and sons.
 I don’t want any problems, and I don’t want to see any weapons.
 Drug dealing has never been an honorable profession, so anything could happen.
 Though I have never met the buyer, I have been assured by his girlfriend that he will have the money and the deal will take only a few minutes.

 "You wished he'd gotten you with child."
 Mrs. Tranton nodded, finally meeting her daughter's eyes again.
 "It would have made life difficult, and it would have been a shame and an embarrassment to my family.
 But I would have had a part of him.

 She took Marie's hand, squeezing it.
 "I don't know if it's any comfort, but I understand how much you're hurting."

One false move and I’ll kill you both.
 Is that clear?”
 Harruq nodded, shivering as he felt the tip of the blade rubbing against the tender skin of his throat.
 “Good.
 Pleasant days, half-orc.
 May Celestia watch over you…‌and condemn your actions to death.”
 The biting tip left his throat, the blades in the bow retracted, and then the elf vanished.
 Harruq struggled to his feet, clutching his neck as he gasped for air.
 “Damn elf,” he cursed.
 “How dare you threaten us.”

It has been many years since I have been involved in a drug deal, and my assumption is that the process hasn’t changed much.
 My mother has been through too much pain and I can’t imagine what affect it would have on her to visit another family member in jail if things go badly tonight.
 I think about the deep secret I have now and what my mother would think, and those defining moments that led me here.
 Chapter 2: Small Town Whispers Sometimes life’s secrets begin with life itself.
 My mother discovered she was pregnant with my older brother Thomas while she was still a high school student in a tiny town in Kansas.
 To this day the town still has brick streets and tiny homes that are a throwback to simpler times.
 The town is so small that the phonebook is about the size of a comic book.
 It was 1957 and she was impregnated by her boyfriend in the back seat of his parents’ car.
 My mother and father decided to sneak out to a neighboring town and get married after they discovered her pregnancy.
 After their wedding, they returned to their respective homes each night, keeping their secret.

The West has been exporting manufacturing jobs in large numbers for half a century, fuelling the growth of Japan, the East Asia tigers, and more recently China; but until the emergence of the information superhighway, the scope for export of service jobs was limited.
 Technological development has changed that.
 As a result, business process outsourcing has become one of the fastest growing sectors of the world economy.
 As growth of the labour force slows in high-income countries, there will be increasing pressure for export of service jobs.
 Public concern in the West over the rapid growth of outsourcing is fuelled by the common misconception that employment is a zero sum game.
 A recent authoritative study of the impact of IT outsourcing found that the direct gains to the US economy in the form of additional jobs in other fields, higher real wages, higher real GDP growth, contained inflation and expanded exports far outweigh the losses.
 While global IT software and service outsourcing displaces some IT workers, total employment increases as the benefits ripple through the economy.
 The net additional number of jobs in the USA added as a result of outsourcing is projected to exceed 300,000 by 2008.
 They will be generated across all sectors of the economy, most especially in construction, transportation and utilities, education and health services, wholesale trade, and financial services.
 Employment is not a zero sum game.

And to Qurrah.”
 “I would have it no other way,” Velixar said.
 A hand touched his forehead.
 All the anger that had raged inside Harruq roared like a fire suddenly loosed upon a dry forest.
 Sweat poured from his skin.
 His head jerked upward, his eyes soaking in the white of Velixar’s hand and the dim glow of the stars.
 Power flowed into him, his muscles stretching and tightening in a chaotic manner.
 “Rise, Harruq Tun,” Velixar said.
 “Revel in the power of Karak.”
 “By the gods, brother, if you could see yourself,” Qurrah said, his voice full of shock and wonder.

“So,” Emily said and tapped her fingers on the cave wall, “is that all?” “Yes.” “Well then,” she looked us in the eyes, “what are we waiting for?
 Let's get a move on and leave this small, damp cave.” I shrugged and followed her out.
 The sky was lit but still had a gloomy feeling mixed in with the warmth.
 I felt a sense of dread as we entered the never-ending forest again.
 A few rays fought their way through the thick canopy of trees, making it possible to see what was around you.
 Seth led the way as we followed a faint path through the unknown.
 I was bringing up the rear of the line, Emily in front of me.
 I watched her cloak swish around her ankles, the rhythm surprisingly soothing to me.
 The silence was unnatural, and I felt like there should be some kind of sound.
 I shouldn't have thought that.

"We should find a ribbon to tie it so that the strands won't come lose."
 He fingered the silky lock.
 This was all he'd have left of her.
 Swallowing, he nodded.
 "I don't have any, but I'll buy one.
 For now I'll put it in a book."
 They went to the living room, and he put it in her copy of The Dragonriders of Pern.
 Drawing her down with him onto the sofa, he asked, "Is there anything special you want to do tonight?"
 "My last night here."
 Her heart soared and then plummeted, bouncing around erratically just as it had when he'd first told her he could help her get home.

Vincent took an angry swipe at the last, a small female, and then our pack burst from the trees.
 A second later, our enemies were in full rout.
 Splintered Excerpt Alec had been promising to take me somewhere new for nearly a week, but pack business kept getting in the way.
 I'd been expecting some posh restaurant in Vegas or maybe LA.
 The world kind of becomes your oyster when you've got your own jet.
 The last thing I'd expected was a picnic up at the top of the mountain that cradled the Graves' estate between large, rocky spurs.
 It was perfect.
 For Alec money was nothing more than a useful tool, but he understood I still wasn't comfortable having that tool used to purchase me things I didn't really need.
 I'd set out determined to hike the whole way up to the top, but I was still a little weak.
 Apparently everyone had been right about just how much blood I'd lost the night our pack had destroyed the local rival pack.

Fresh tears ran down her cheeks.
 He tilted her chin up, wiping away her tears.
 "Won't you consider staying here with me?
 Marrying me?"
 Her throat tightened, and she pulled her chin free, shaking her head.
 "I can't."
 She gripped his hands.
 "It's like a lifeline.
 I love you, and I love 2011, but if I let go of my home, I'd be lost."
 Rick reached into his pocket, taking out his handkerchief and handing it to her.

Restoration of a common economic space – which is being criticized internationally as a surrender of sovereignty to Russia at a time when both Western Europe and North America are striving for closer economic union – could immediately restore most of that lost output.
 The advantages of cooperation between republics needs to be care fully examined.
 A study should be conducted by a credible institution to estimate the economic losses incurred by the break-up of the common economic space between the former Soviet re publics and to assess the benefits of restoring an economic union in some form.
 It should estimate overall economic growth and living standards for each republic over the next five years operating within and outside the economic union.
 This study can serve as a powerful argument for closer cooperation among the republics.
 The study can be undertaken at very low cost by a consortium of researchers from different research institutes within the Commonwealth of Independent States.
 5.Privatize and develop road transport: Transportation is a major bottleneck to development of a market economy in much of the region.
 Under the centrally planned system, most freight was hauled by trains over main routes to large cities for distribution in bulk by huge government procurement agencies.
 Under a market system, millions of small producers and consumers must be free to buy or sell wherever the price is most attractive.
 This requires a vast proliferation of small goods transporters in the private sector, which are rare in many countries today.

And I was tied to a wall.
 Why hadn’t they killed me already?
 I waited for the flames.
 What came instead was far more excruciating.
 I expected to collapse as my body disconnected from my mind, but the vines held me in place.
 I saw a few final flickers of the battle before my eyes looked toward the sky, rolling back into my head.
 I had no way of forming a coherent thought or I might have been afraid.
 Chapter Seventeen A Fitting End
 I was surprised, in my dreams, that I wasn’t already dead.
 For a long time, there was no sound, only those disjointed images.

Art – That was the first time for me.
 Did it happen to you before?
 Jim – Not to me particularly.
 Art – What does that mean?
 Jim – I was around someone else when it happened to him.
 Art – Who and when?
 Jim – It was Gene, during his ‘protesting God’ phase, when he would stand outside churches with a sign that said ‘God sucks’ or something like that.
 Art – I remember that.
 I’m glad he finally grew out of it.
 Though he chose an odd thing to move on to.

“You’re not going to teach me elvish, are you?”
 Aurelia gave him a playful jab to the side.
 “No, it is in the gods’ language, your gods anyway.
 Karak and Ashhur got something right having humans speak and write the same language.”
 “What do you mean?”
 “Do you not know the story of Karak and Ashhur?” The half-orc shook his head.
 “I will tell you it, if you care to hear.
 Mankind, as well as orcs, wolf-men, hyena-men, and all the other odd races scattered about Dezrel, are less than five hundred years old.
 Many elves remember the arrival of the brother gods and the creation of man.”
 “Huh,” Harruq said.

There were only two truly powerful weapons like those used by a member of the Immortal Guards – the soldiers that enforced the rule of the Immortalist Guild of the Celestial Path who ruled all the Eastern Kingdoms and neither of these weapons were kept in the armory.
 He looked over to the short swords laying on one of the tables and picked two of them up; they felt a little weird.
 The swords were too light and the balance seemed off as he took a few practice strokes.
 There was a large two-handed great sword, a weapon that was difficult to handle if you were not very strong, and its sheath matched the armor he now wore.
 Rodregas picked it up and took a few swings and found that it was not as clumsy as he thought it would be.
 It was of average make, and he did not like such large swords.
 The weight provided a lot of momentum and power for a strike, but if you missed it was hard to recover and very easy to leave yourself wide open for a counter strike from your opponent.
 It looked like the guards had gone to celebrate “his” birthday by taking most of the better armor and weapons with them.
 Rodregas grabbed a shield as well, and a barrel of the best looking arrows and carried them to the front entrance.
 There was probably money in the purser’s office, but he knew that the door, as well as the room was rigged with poison needles and other traps, both mundane and magical.

"What else is a girl to do?"
 Alec's reply shrug mirrored mine exactly and yet still turned the movement into something far more graceful and eloquent than what I'd managed.
 "Be that as it may, I think you don't give yourself enough credit for just how amazing you are."
 I felt myself start to blush as Alec disappeared into the bathroom.
 ** Monsters I could handle, motorcycles were something else entirely.
 I'd almost backed out when Alec told me we'd be taking his bullet bike, but I didn't want him to know I really was a complete wuss.
 All of which explained how I'd ended up on Alec's shiny, blue Yamaha R1 with my arms locked around him in a death grip.
 Apparently I'd given away at least some of my fear though, because Alec took the first half of our forty-minute drive at a positively sedate pace, or at least what qualified as a sedate pace on a machine that could go from zero to sixty much faster than any of the exotic sports cars Alec and his friends usually drove.
 Just as I finally started to enjoy leaning with Alec while zipping around turns at what I was starting to suspect were triple digit speeds, he pulled off behind a ramshackle, old building and held a finger to his lips.
 I held my breath and tried my best to try and figure out what he was listening for, but encased as I was by the blue helmet he'd insisted on, I would've been lucky to notice if a herd of elephants had been hot on our trail.

"Unacceptable.
 I've added that up in my head, and you've still got several hours each day that you haven't accounted for."
 Despite my best efforts, I was mumbling so badly I wasn't sure anything I'd said was comprehensible.
 Somewhere in there I'd closed my eyes, so I felt a sluggish, tired kind of surprise when he gently brushed his fingers across the side of my face.
 The sensation was so feathery I almost opened my eyes to verify that he'd really touched me.
 It was too much effort.
 Besides, I didn't really want to know if he hadn't touched me, it was better to just go on pretending he had.
 "I'm afraid that really is the balance of my time.
 I spend time with Rachel of course.
 Then there are a few odd minutes where I squeeze in some reading, or a bit of painting."

Chevelle answered slowly, “There has to be a way.
 You broke them before.” I tried to remember how.
 The first magic I could recall was the thistle in the back room at Junnie’s.
 It seemed so far away now.
 Ruby was speaking to him.
 “Maybe it was just the length of time…” What did she know about how long I was bound?
 “If we can find a way to test without endangering—” He stopped.
 “Don’t worry about it, Frey.” I wondered if I’d looked frightened.
 “We will figure it out.” How reassuring.
 I meant to smile at him, but only succeeded in pressing my lips into a flat line.

Qurrah was unpracticed, and his delivery brutal.
 Still, the vision did come, clouded and chaotic.
 _A gang of children slept on a stack of hay.
 They were filthy, scrawny, and diseased.
 A small rat crept near, its mouth covered with flecks of white foam.
 When close enough, it latched onto the hand of the biggest child, who awoke screaming.
 Time distorted so that days passed as that scream lingered.
 His face paled, his mouth foamed, and then he died, screaming, still screaming._
 _The vision ended.
 Velixar opened his eyes._

Often Tom’s father called to ask if Brandon could come over to help his son through his darker depressed moments and we would always allow it, no matter what time of the day or night.
 I was so impressed by Brandon’s mature behavior and his unwavering friendship and love for Tom.
 One day Tom’s father called me to thank me for Brandon’s friendship to his son.
 He was emotional when he called as he told me that long after the fundraisers, gatherings and phone calls for his son had stopped, only one friend was still calling and visiting and it was Brandon.
 I was so very proud of him.
 One evening, less than a year later, Brandon cancelled a night out with his friends, including Tom.
 He didn't feel like going out.
 His wheelchair-bound friend went anyway.
 The phone rang late that night with the unbelievable news of another car accident.
 This time Tom’s paralyzed body was thrown through the window and he tumbled down the highway to his death.

“Dreams,” I complained.
 She smiled as she sat on the bed beside me.
 “Some seek out the breath.
 They say it is foresight.” “Foresight?” She nodded.
 “What did you see?” She raised an eyebrow questioningly.
 “Not the future.” She laughed.
 “Have a bath.
 You’ll be good as new.” The water was coming in the window again and I wondered at what I had just read.
 Surely the dust and fog were meddling with my thoughts.
 “Chevelle will be swapping with us for the evening,” she explained.

I won't stop you if you do.
 If you can convince your mom to leave town there's even a chance you'll be safe from Brandon."
 Shivers worked their way down my spine as some of the pieces clicked into place.
 "He's like you, isn't he?"
 Alec's laugh was a bitter, humorless thing.
 "You mean a monster?
 Yes, we both feel the call of the moon.
 Does that scare you?"
 I shook my head.
 "No.

Only after, though.
 I will try to never question the order of my master or the will of my brother.”
 Velixar nodded although he appeared not to listen.
 Instead, his eyes burrowed into Harruq’s, prying information not from his mouth but from his very soul.
 “Tell me, Harruq, why do you mourn the lives of those you kill?”
 “I don’t,” Harruq said.
 He wasn’t sure if it was lie or truth, most likely a lie.
 “War is brutal.
 Life is brutal.” Velixar put a cold hand against Harruq’s face.
 “You do not understand, but we are bringers of peace.

With his free hand he made a fist and slammed the side of her head.
 Not with all his strength, but still a serious hit.
 She grunted and let go, growled and stepped over the bear’s body.
 He slowly reached up, and using the full strength of his body, pushed hard on her muscular chest, pushing her away from the bear’s haunch.
 He then ignored her and went back to cutting the haunch loose.
 He waited but the two lionesses seemed to have gone from aggression to napping, with him missing the transition.
 Slowly, Rodregas got up with his bear haunch and took it back to the barn.
 He met the surprised look of Doi’van and Imeralda with a half smile, “I hope you like the taste of bear?” As he was unsure of how old the meat was, he immediately started a fire and started to cook it.
 As he worked on preparing the fire he explained what had happened.
 “Are you suicidal?” asked Imeralda in an angry voice.

Growing damage to the basic life support systems of soil, water, flora, fauna and the atmosphere is taking place in all parts of the world.
 Unemployment: In the West, rising levels of unemployment have increased resistance to free trade and immigration.
 Rising levels of long-term unemployment and youth unemployment in inner cities are associated with the increasing incidence of crime.
 In developing countries, rapid population growth continues to outpace job creation in most regions, resulting in high levels of unemployment, increasing social unrest and large scale migration from rural to urban areas and internationally.
 Gender discrimination: Gender remains a major determinant of privilege and discrimination worldwide.
 Women still suffer from unfavourable sex ratios, lower wages and restraints on property owner ship, as well as higher levels of illiteracy and lower educational attainments.
 Rising violence: Violence is on the increase, especially violence within society in the form of civil wars, crime and drugs.
 During the first half of 1994, 36 armed conflicts were in progress.
 During the past year, more than half a million people perished in Somalia and Rwanda alone.
 Nearly 100 less-known conflicts rage at the present moment.

“Come on up, Korin.
 I have a surprise for you,” Rodregas whispered under his breath.
 He went around the room one final time poking around for anything else of note and, finding nothing, went over to the door to the water closet.
 Inside he first tested out the plumbing, finding the experience both new and familiar.
 He also had a chance to examine his own plumbing, and was pleased with the results; his new body was large and powerfully built even in places that most people would not see.
 The only thing of use in the water closet was a shaving kit which Rodregas added to the trunk.
 Next he went to the study door only to find it locked.
 He looked for a key but there was nothing.
 He guessed that it was locked by magic and required a magic word or incantation to open the lock.
 He pushed and pulled on the door, but it was solidly made and there was nothing to get a good hold of to test his new strength.

When Rodregas had seen the Dire Cats in their cage he had not been able to imagine a more powerful lion.
 The Celestial Lion was simply breathtaking; almost twice as large as the Dire Cats and even more powerfully built.
 It was not simply size that set him apart however.
 It was a way of moving, a grace that spoke of perfection.
 To look at a Celestial Beast made Rodregas wish he could write poetry like some noble in one of the high western courts; it made him struggle for words that he simply did not have.
 And what did this marvelous beast do?
 Rutted, gorged, and fell asleep ready for the slaughter.
 Rodregas could not help but shake his head at how life can show you miracles that made you want to live again, and that using the same miracle drives home the fact that there is truly no justice to existence.
 His eyes jerked back to Ravenhurr, as the sorcerer made a jerking motion, rising up from his sky tube.
 “Now,” he said and quickly repeated in his deep but smooth voice, “NOW!” Captain Poir, the leader of Ravenhurr’s guards, had stepped out of the shadows and approached the prisoners, but Rodregas stepped forward first and grabbed the half AElf maiden’s arm.

“I will show you, my disciple, but first I have a gift for my dearest bone general.”
 Velixar drew out his magical chest.
 He set it beside him and let it grow out to normal size.
 From within he pulled out a suit of armor stained a deep shade of black.
 He threw it to Harruq, who managed to catch it even though his mouth hung wide open.
 “The first Horde War was caused by a disciple of mine,” the man in black explained.
 “He blessed the armor of one of the leaders of the orcish clans.
 I claimed it when he fell on the battlefield.”
 Harruq examined the suit, turning it over in his hands.
 It was composed of many interwoven straps of thick leather.

I stopped off at my locker before heading to the tutor room, but Britney was nowhere to be seen.
 Probably still mad.
 I mentally shrugged as I swapped out books, and set off.
 Rachel was already seated in her usual spot in no-man's-land.
 I debated where to sit for a second.
 I'd done the right thing in standing up to Cassie, but I didn't want to further alienate Brandon, or put myself anymore firmly in the group of idiots who looked to Alec as their master and liege.
 Before I could finish weighing the pros and cons, Rachel looked up and caught my eye.
 The smile that appeared on her face was tentative but genuine, and completely resolved my doubts.
 I returned her shy greeting with a smile of my own, and sat down at the table closest to her.
 Britney entered the tutor lab a few minutes later, and frowned at me before going over and sitting at the end of the room containing the jocks and cheerleaders.

This approach establishes criteria for determining when claims of national sovereignty must be ignored.
 Every right is accompanied by a responsibility.
 A government that fosters external aggression or cannot contain domestic violence and civil strife, that cannot create conditions in which its people can feed themselves or even receive outside assistance, fails the test of sovereignty.
 Under these circumstances, the international community, through the UN, should have the right and accept the responsi bility to intervene appropriately.
 The need of the hour is not to undermine the legitimate right of nations to self-determination, but rather to protect that right by more clearly demarcating its legitimate boundaries against the highly visible challenges being posed by forces of disintegration and fragmentation from within.
 The current tendency for states to fragment along ethnic lines cannot be handled by any abstract principle of international law.
 It depends on the understanding and will of people.
 The evolution of larger, heterogeneous national units functioning under principles of equality is an outstanding product of civilization that should not and cannot be reversed without great damage to the general welfare of humanity.
 The only solution is to work constantly to educate the public in all countries to understand the benefits of national integration and international cooperation.
 The implications of this view will be endorsed by some and opposed by others.

He couldn't bear the thought of losing her.
 But he hated seeing her miserable.
 "Marie," he said softly, stroking her hair, "you've been here for over five weeks.
 You've walked in the garden almost every morning.
 What if you can't get back?
 What if--" "Don't say that!"
 She sat up, looking at him in horror.
 "I can't even imagine never seeing my family again!
 Do you know how upset they must be, how terrified they must be wondering what happened to me?"
 She closed her eyes, catching her breath.

My throat went dry, black spots swirling in my vision.
 I fought to stay focused on his face, so close.
 His eyes grew troubled and then he blurred out of vision as I went limp in his arms.
 “Frey…” I opened my eyes to the darkening sky.
 “What happened?” “You seem to have blacked out,” Chevelle said, a hint of some emotion under his reassurance.
 I blushed.
 He must have seen that coming, held me because of it, simply to prevent me from falling on my face.
 I was a fool.
 He helped me up, this time holding me only by one arm.
 I took a deep breath.

I mean, he was untouchable.
 But, yeah, we hung out for a while.
 This would have been, uh, early 69, I think.
 He slept on my couch for a while.
 We’d get stoned, sit up all night talking, blues, soul—he knew it all, man.
 The cat lived music.
 And, you know, he was bleeding, that’s the sad truth, man, he was bleeding and no one could see.
 I didn’t know it.
 He was just full of pain, man.
 He had to do drugs.

I didn't have any idea if it really was, but it seemed incredible that anything could've wreaked such damage.
 The bricks on the wall next to the door were cracked and set back in the wall, almost like they'd been hit with some kind of wrecking ball, and the concrete of the sidewalk had gouges crisscrossing its surface like some kind of abstract painting.
 "There's nothing to see here, kids.
 I want you to all disperse and go to your home rooms."
 The short, mostly bald man who'd ordered us all to leave was just visible through a gap in the crowd.
 He walked like an administrator, but I hadn't ever seen him before.
 "Who's that?"
 Brandon started just a little, like he'd been thinking of something else.
 "Mr. Rindell, the assistant principal."
 Now that my complete attention wasn't on the various destroyed bits of school property, I noticed how much whispering was going on.

Apparently Alec knew how to interpret it.
 He turned back and caught me again before I could hit the ground.
 "There isn't anything to worry about now.
 Go ahead and catch your breath."
 As pleasant as it was to be in his arms again, I was starting to worry he'd get tired of it.
 I pushed him away as soon as I was reasonably confident my knees would support me.
 "What's going on?
 Why are they so scared of Brandon?"
 Alec shook his head.
 "This isn't the time; we need to get you back home to your mom.

How many times could the earth be pulled from beneath my feet?
 Chevelle took a step toward me and I held up a hand to stop him.
 Bound against using magic.
 Assigned a watcher.
 My anger toward him returned, swift and unforgiving.
 He had been a volunteer.
 “Let’s just go,” I said coldly, looking up the mountain.
 We rode wordlessly on as I chewed over this new knowledge.
 As my watcher, Chevelle would have been involved in the binding by Council.
 Maybe Fannie should have been punished for whatever she had done, but how could they assume I would follow in her footsteps?

“Stay on the root,” she warned him.
 “You cannot take one of the blessings off the tree; it will wither and die if you try.” She winked at Rodregas as she said this.
 Imeralda then proceeded to eat the acorn shaped fruit; it took some work.
 It seemed to be a bit harder than any ripe fruit Rodregas knew of, but he followed her example and found that while it was tart it was amazing.
 It tasted of... Rodregas did not know what to call the flavor; the words that came to mind were sunlight and rain and the smell of a forest at night.
 When Rodregas finished the fruit completely he felt more whole but was also sad that it was gone.
 Imeralda seemed in great humor.
 “Come on,” she said.
 She dropped to her hands on the edge of the branch and then dropped down as if she was only feet from the ground which, strangely she was.
 Rodregas saw her standing on the ground.

Aurelia leaned back and tucked a few strands of hair behind her ear as high above the stars sparkled sadly.
 “Promise you will never strike at me, or those close to me, ever again.”
 The half-orc shifted uncomfortably in the grass.
 “You know I’d never do that.”
 “No, Harruq, I don’t know.
 I think I know, I desperately want to believe I know, but I don’t.
 So promise me.”
 “Aurry…”
 “Promise me now, or I will drag you back to the elves and let them deal the justice you deserve.”
 Harruq glared into the fire.

James 4: 17 in the King James declares, “Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.” The New International Version reads “Anyone, then, who knows the good he ought to do and doesn’t do it, sins."
 The New American Standard’s version is, “Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin.” Put these translations together, they insist that to do good is the right thing and what we ought to do.
 But even in consort, they don’t explain why we ought to do good or why we should avoid sin.
 We could infer we should do it because God said so, but to some of us, that answer feels unworthy.
 Pastor Ed Noble suggested an answer that rings more complete.
 The word translated "the right thing" or “the good” or what we “ought to do” is the Greek kalos in the accusative case, more naturally translated as "beautiful".
 So what we ought to seek is "the beautiful" or "to do the beautiful".
 One reason I would rather seek the beautiful than the good is because I can know with more confidence when I have encountered it.
 When I first read the John Keats poem, “Ode on a Grecian Urn” I got both enthralled and challenged by the lines “Beauty is truth, truth beauty.
 That is all we know on earth and all we need to know.” I believe those words are inspired, expressing deep though mysterious wisdom.

He weighed over 200 pounds and he could do some damage any way he beat us.
 The primary goal when getting beaten by a person nearly twice one’s size is to limit injuries and not escalate the violence because there is no winning.
 I had seen this tactic with my grandfather and my uncle, and my brother and I were now in a similar situation.
 When someone saw the marks or bruises on our bodies we lied so we didn’t get a repeat performance.
 Gym teachers or other kids during showers after PE class asked the most questions.
 We just blamed it on each other as a fight between brothers.
 We just learned to live with it and survive.
 We became quite the fighters at school and other kids learned not to screw with us or we would beat them down.
 It was just something one gets good at when one is in constant training.
 My parents—I had been instructed to refer to Dino as my father—entertained a lot.

It was an accident.
 A product of her temper, her human emotions.
 They were testing her, a servant told me.
 Anvil was holding her back, Rune with magic.
 She snapped and they saw her power.
 Some denied the possibility but not my father.
 He has attained his prize, that which he has always coveted.
 I will stop him.
 ~ The plan is forming, but I am unsure whether it will work.
 I know I cannot defeat him, and his guard, alone.

I swallowed the bit of strawberry that had been in my mouth.
 “I don’t know, ambush them back?” “They might see that coming,” she pointed out, “and it’s really obvious.” “Well, they think we won’t do that because that is exactly what they would be expecting, so by actually doing it, we can trick them,” I rambled on and grabbed another strawberry.
 Emily tapped her lip with her pencil and straightened her pink pajamas.
 “I have no clue what you just said Jazell.” I laughed, “What I meant was that we should ambush them.
 Give them a piece of what they did to us.” Emily’s eyes lit up, “You mean use water guns…” “And water balloons…” I added.
 “And a trebuchet to launch the balloons!” Emily scribbled furiously on her paper.
 “I can build one easily.” “Sweet, but when do we do it?
 All four of us hang out every day.” “I can solve that problem.
 We just tell them we want a day to do girl things and they’ll butt right out,” she slid onto the floor and snatched a strawberry.
 I grinned, “This is going to be some fun revenge!” “You can say that again.” “Okay,” I said, “this is going to be some fun revenge.” She wacked me in the head with my pillow, “You’re so weird.” “Well that’s the way I am, deal with it,” I wacked her back with my own pillow.

A novella about a young woman whose Christian parents, when their daughter finds herself in extreme trouble, appear more concerned with remaining in accord with their church than with helping or even trying to understand their daughter.
 Its honesty touches my heart.
 Jaime and I spend a day roaming the city, with an hour stop at the Seattle Mystery Bookstore, which played a role in the final scene of Road Kill, an account of a book tour my friend Alan and I did together.
 At several of the tour stops, including Seattle and Portland, Mike Connelly joined us.
 Since then, Mike has become an international bestseller.
 Alan hasn’t.
 Neither have I, probably for many reasons concerning craft, background, personality, genre and such.
 But I still have to wonder if God’s hand might play a role in my lack of whopping success.
 Maybe he knows lots of money would turn me from a rascal into a scoundrel, more self-absorbed than ever.
 I wonder if Brother Lawrence, had he become Pope, would have practiced the presence of God so well.

 Rick watched without seeing and listened without hearing as Ricky and Lucy fought.
 It had been Marie's favorite show.

 Harruq stared at the words representing his name, feeling a tiny thrill.
 “How about my last name, Tun?”

 “Can I see your name?” he asked.

The pictures in the ad were racy and the price per session was about twice the normal cost for such services.
 I called to set up a “massage.” I told her I got massages often for my ailing back but I thought it would be fun to get a massage from a pretty young lady.
 We scheduled an appointment for later that same day.
 I’ve had back problems in the past, as many 50 year olds do, so I dug up a back support and I wore it to the appointment.
 I had a basic plan and an obvious goal but how it would unfold was a mystery.
 She met me at the door, dressed in casual sweats and no make-up.
 Despite looking a little weary, she looked like she could be very attractive if she tried.
 As I looked at her, I felt sorry for her because I knew she was about the same age as my sons and I knew she was somebody’s daughter, somebody’s baby and I also knew the sordid details of her existence.
 She led me into a surprisingly clean bedroom that had a complete bedroom set and a mirrored closet door was beside the bed.
 She pointed me towards a chair in the corner of the room and told me I could get undressed and put my clothes on the chair.

Cooperative Security
 Eliminating nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles and small arms proliferation are practical measures whose time has come.
 But by themselves these steps will only mitigate the most pernicious threats to international security.
 They will not provide an effective system for ensuring the peace and security of all nations that is so vitally needed, and now so imminently possible, as a basis for accelerating the political, economic and social development of humankind.
 The end of the Cold War provides us with the opportunity, and pressing global issues provide the urgency, for more significant measures.
 These measures cannot be conceived within the perspective of international security that has dominated our thinking in the post-war period, or from a half-hearted desire to modestly improve what to some still appears an adequate and acceptable system.
 This is an occasion that demands visionary and courageous leadership to usher in a better world.
 The children of the next millennium will judge us by our response.
 Historically, all landmark changes in the international political and security system have been the result of armed conflicts, wars and revolutions.
 In each case the victors who emerged from the ashes of war sought to build on a static formula for enforcing peace in a dynamic world.

 He swallowed.
 "I've never seen anyone who looks as good as you in one."
 She smiled then, reaching for his hand.
 "Come on--let's go."
 "Wait.
 You need to put on shorts and a shirt over your bathing suit."
 "Oh.
 OK."  She went to do as he said.

Or do the lyrics come first?
 BG:  	Have we already talked about this?
 Why does this sound familiar?
 Maybe I’m deja vuing.
 Anyway, I do it both ways.
 Sometimes the lyrics come out, you know, like a poem, when I’m shaving or in the bath.
 Or first thing in the morning, you have to jump from bed and scribble them down.
 Like the phrase “Her glances could break arms.”  I just woke up with that, you know.
 Those are gifts.
 I don’t know where they come from.

If it'd been a physical wind it would've knocked me over.
 Intangible or not, it still staggered me and only my grip on Jasmin and Dom kept me from dropping to my knees.
 Alec stood motionless for a pair of seconds, and then seemed to explode and melt back into himself.
 I blinked, and his human body had been replaced with the hybrid form that'd saved my life once before.
 Only this time he wasn't fighting wolves, he was fighting another hybrid, and Brandon towered over him.
 There was another ripple of movement on the other side of the light.
 Jasmin and Dom both pulled away from me, joining the other three, facing outward in preparation for the inevitable attack.
 Vincent's dark form inched slightly closer, but Brandon's growl froze his henchman in place.
 The complete stillness that resulted was suddenly shattered by a flash of heat lightning off to the east, and when the spots cleared from my vision, the two hybrids were a blur of motion.
 Merely human eyes never could've hoped to follow all of the action.

 Eugene – I said it in a plain voice.
 And they laughed.
 Liz – Oh, poor Gene.
 Jim – At least they didn’t chase you off the bus, or hurt you.
 Eugene – I did manage to make some cash, so it’s not a complete loss.
 Jim – You didn’t rob them did you?
 That’ll cause one helluva international incident.
 Eugene – No, I didn’t steal anything.
 Liz – Then how did you make some money?

Liz – Not a diary huh?
 What’s the difference between a diary and a journal hmmm?
 They seem the same to me.
 Jim – There are a lot of differences…
 Liz – Such as?
 Jim – Well… A Journal… A diary… Journals aren’t pink.
 And… And the cover says diary instead of journal… Journal rather than diary that is.
 Anyone can keep a Journal, where as diaries are usually kept by thirteen year old girls who only talk about their first kiss and the newest popular music groups.
 Liz – How long have you been keeping your diary?
 Jim – I’ve been keeping my JOURNAL since I was 14.

"You look lovely this morning, my dear."
 "Thank you.
 I didn't mean to interrupt.
 I didn't think you were going to be doing business at home this morning."
 "Young Lawson is eager to close the deal as quickly as possible.
 Says he's going to build two houses on that property.
 Not a good location for houses, in my opinion, but who can tell young people anything these days?
 I hear that he bought two other pieces of land last month.
 Bad investment, in my opinion.

They'd told Teri and Jeremy that Marie was working on a master's degree in history at Boston College.
 As they headed for the living room, Rick slid his arm around Marie's waist, leaning close to whisper, "You're doing fine, sweetheart."
 She glanced up at him.
 "It's so hard to pretend we don't live together."
 He kissed her hair.
 "That's because it's become so natural to you."
 Rick sat in a chair across from Marie rather than joining her on the loveseat so that they wouldn't appear too familiar with each other.
 He was glad his conscience had gotten the best of him and kept him from seducing her Monday night.
 If having Teri and Jeremy suspect that they were living together embarrassed her, losing her virginity before marriage would devastate her.
 "So how did you like my sister?"

 A lot of lost time.
 Liz – How did John find it?
 Didn’t your dad keep it hidden?
 Jim – Ill just say that there was a lot to hide.
 And to be able to have access to it, well there wasn’t any practical way to really keep it out of the hands of anyone who actually bothered to look.
 Liz – There’s that much?
 Jim – Dad could almost start his own shop with what he’s got so far.
 Liz – I never thought of your dad as a dirty old man before.

Every great endeavour requires a proportionate investment of energy and resources for its accomplishment.
 The realization of peace and prosperity is no exception.
 What, then, are the resources required for this achievement and where are we to find them?
 The history of civilization is the process of humankind discovering greater and greater resources and learning how to utilize them to acquire higher and higher levels of physical security, productive power and comfort.
 In the earliest phase, these resources were almost exclusively material.
 The next phase brought the discovery of tools and instruments that made the material resources far more productive and valuable than before.
 Gradually, society discovered rudimentary organizational resources – the capacity to organize productive activities in a more effective manner.
 The organization of farming utilized the tree to make a plough with which to cultivate repeatedly the same land, giving birth to sedentary societies.
 The organization of crafts, commerce, armies, governments – constructed from a fabric of customs, rules, systems and laws – each made use of the material resources for greater productivity, power and achievement.
 At each stage of this evolution, society discovered the power of knowledge to increase further the productivity of the material, technological and organizational resources at its disposal.

Only the way he reached out for my hand indicated that he really wasn't repulsed by me.
 It bothered me the entire time I was in History, and then just before I got to Physics it hit me.
 He hadn't stopped because he didn't want to kiss me.
 He stopped because with all of my blushing and near-terror it'd been obvious I wasn't ready to be kissed.
 It was the ultimate act of chivalry.
 I more or less floated through my last two classes.
 It wasn't until I finally got to tutoring that I started to put more stock in the idea that Rachel had simply chosen not to go to Les Misérables.
 She looked up, and then away guiltily as I walked in.
 There wasn't a trace of smile or greeting on her face, an abnormality that hit me hard somewhere in the region of my stomach.
 Albert stopped by to say hi, and I used his presence as a distraction.

I shrugged as my breathing started to slow down again.
 "It's okay.
 Where were you?"
 "Scouting.
 We had to make sure Brandon's pack wasn't waiting for us."
 "How can you be sure?

 Alec shook his head, his eyes strangely gentle.
 "No, if they were hanging around outside we'd be able to smell them."
 "So not only are you faster and stronger than normal people, you've also got noses like real wolves?"

Not that I wouldn’t have attempted it again anyway, but at least I know I’m safer now.
 No worries when I’m out of the castle.
 My sister is out every day but I can never seem to find her.
 She keeps bringing back the strangest treasures.
 I have run for two days now.
 I think tomorrow I will follow her.
 She refuses to tell me where she goes, neither under threat nor for a bribe, so I’ll have to use stealth.
 ~ Today was brilliant.
 I left a sleeping Rune just in time to find my sister sneaking from the castle.
 I followed her all the way to her secret spot.

“They won’t touch you.”
 “I know,” Aurelia said, summoning the last bit of magic inside her.
 A tear in the fabric of reality ripped open, swirling with white and blue magic.
 “Get in,” she yelled.
 “What about Qurrah?” he shouted.
 “Go inside, you dumb fool!”
 She cracked her staff across his back.
 Harruq stumbled into the portal and vanished.
 Aurelia stepped in after, arrows landing all around her.

 Or was it a real gang?

Rodregas looked around the arena to make sure no one was left to fight and then headed into the great hall, carrying the shield of the tournament champion.
 As he walked the hallway into the main hearing chamber, knights stood along the walls.
 As Rodregas passed they all mumbled the same words to him, “Welcome to the Order my brother.” Several reached out and shook his hand or showed other signs of welcome.
 Others, though, looked at him strangely, clearly put off by the way he had won the melee.
 He felt a little unsteady, not sure what to make of both the welcome and the uncomfortable looks.
 As he passed through the doors in the main hearing chamber, the Grand Marshal stood at the far end waiting.
 In the chamber were both knights and squires.
 Many smiled; he thought a few looked like the ones in the hall, not sure what to think of this new knight.
 Rodregas was not surprised that when he started to kneel in front of the Grand Marshal, for Van’dret to step forward and speak.
 “Grand Marshal, you are not really thinking of knighting this fiend, are you?

Neither of these claims has proven true.
 Living standards have actually declined in most African countries during the last two decades.
 Regional and tribal politics have flourished.
 Dozens of civil and inter-state wars have been fought, accounting for millions of lost lives.
 Food production and employment have lagged far behind population growth.
 In the absence of legal channels of protest, opposition parties have frequently resorted to violence.
 By the end of the 1980s the lack of material progress and the emergence of young educated professionals in leadership positions had fostered, on the one hand, a revolt against single-party rule and, on the other, popular pressure for multi-party democracy that have together resulted in a democratic domino effect, similar to the spread of communist rule which Western democracies had feared would overwhelm South Asia twenty years ago.
 As recently as 1989, only four African countries could be considered stable democracies and three more were moving in that direction.
 Only three years later, 18 African nations could be classified as democratic and a number of others were in the midst of far-reaching political change.
 The peaceful end of apartheid in South Africa is one remarkable outcome of this process.

I was no longer a weeny.
 I was talented.
 I found one other thing you could be and get some attention, the kind of attention you wanted, from girls, from the popular set.
 I mean, I could say I didn’t give a fuck what anyone thought, but you do when you’re becoming pubic, right.
 When your little dickie starts talking to you.
 So, I would do a knockoff of some song on the radio and the girls started following me around.
 And the first thing you know I’m getting handjobs in the girl’s bathroom.
 Cute girls, too, not just the trashy ones.
 The cheerleader types.
 I think my first blowjob was on the school playground, off in a corner, where there was this big bush.

After I grew to manhood, I decided my true place was among one of the other clans, one that follows the lordship of the Hellborn.” He spoke this very slowly each deep rumble of his tone dragged out.
 “I was wrong though, and quickly realized that those who follow the Lords of the Infernal Realms were even a worse fit for me than at home, though they did see me as royal blood and not tainted.” Doi’van added, “I eventually decided to start somewhere new and took a ship across the inland sea.” Doi’van paused at this and shook his head, his hair flying wild, as he seemed to want to shake out a memory from his massive head before he continued.
 “I am afraid I did not ask enough questions.
 I just wanted to get a fresh start.
 I was in Guild Dealer Taigas’ Menagerie to be sold within a week of my arrival.” He finished, his smile fading at the memory.
 “When was that?” Rodregas asked.
 Doi’van looked at him for a second and said, “Two years ago.” “But that makes no sense,” Rodregas said, his voice angry though he did not know why.
 “The Guild is supposed to be trying to make their Immortalists members Celestial.
 Why would they hold you for two years?” Doi’van nodded but then shook his head.
 “Trust me, I would like to know that answer more then you.” Doi’van’s smile was now long gone and with a shrug of his huge misshaped shoulders, he changed the subject.

Back then.
 It was her father, man.
 He was a cunt.
 And he started manipulating Crafty and then us, through Crafty.
 And he would have these fits, like epileptic fits, like anger that couldn’t be dammed.
 He was out of control.
 I think he’s still trying to worm his way into the music business—I don’t really know.
 But he didn’t know a fucking thing about music or the business and he wanted a part of Black Lung, because it looked like we were the next Cream, the next Experience, the next Mountain.
 Whatever.
 He just wanted a slice of the pie, man.

I moved to Lake Tahoe because they still didn’t give a shit how anyone dressed and that was fine with me.
 No white polyester pants here!
 My best friend Pete and I opened a waterbed and hot tub store in North Lake Tahoe called Sierra Waterbeds and Hot Tubs— a venture his father funded.
 I was selling waterbeds and this new invention called a portable hot tub.
 Pete and I still drank and partied and the drugs were still around.
 Unlike most of the people I knew, I managed to be truly a recreational user with no tendencies towards addiction.
 But I am no prude, and we had our share of parties and events in Tahoe and at the waterbed store.
 When you put a bunch of twenty year olds and their friends in a retail store that has working hot tubs and waterbeds, things can quickly spiral out of control.
 We had no window coverings and our parties were in plain view of anyone who put their nose against the windows.
 It was a voyeurs’ paradise and I am sure we entertained a lot of shocked window shoppers late into the night!

The beast’s nostrils flared, breath steaming in the cool morning air.
 Two more of the animals pawed in the distance behind him.
 Steed chirped a whistle and they walked forward, the slim, muscular one moving to stand beside Chevelle as a mammoth crossed in front of me and knelt.
 I drew in a startled breath at the sheer size and nearness of it.
 Steed shot me a mischievous wink.
 “Well?” I was speechless, mouth agape.
 The thing seemed as large and black as a starless night.
 Steed was pleased with my reaction, but Chevelle’s eyes rolled heavenward.
 He didn’t comment, though, simply holding out a hand to help me mount before swinging onto his own.
 “I will ride with you as far north as Naraguah and then make my way east to trade with the imps at Bray,” Steed told Chevelle.

“You are, Seth,” I said.
 I followed Emily, with Jason and Seth on my heels.
 When we reached the blocked cave entrance, Seth drew his sword and sliced the vines apart.
 They fell to the ground and the cave was revealed.
 We walked inside the dimly lit space and I sighed in relief at some safety.
 The air smelled musty and I had a feeling no one had ever been here.
 I sat on the floor next to Emily and the boys sat on the opposite side of the floor.
 “We should all get some rest,” Seth said with a yawn.
 “We can figure out what to do next when we wake up.” I nodded sleepily and laid down on the hard ground.
 I closed my eyes, feeling a strange tiredness come over me.

Rachel's work on her behalf had resulted in a makeup job that was so incredibly understated, even us girls had a hard time detecting it.
 Her wavy brunette hair had been straightened and pulled back in what looked like an attempt to let some other girls shine for a change, but it just made her look like a goddess who'd decided to spend the night slumming.
 Given who she'd spent the last hour being surrounded by, it was no wonder Dominic was worried she was the ugly step sister.
 She needn't have worried.
 Her features were even more exotic than Jasmin's, and Rachel had chosen bright colors that made her stand out much more than usual.
 James' macho cool really was going to finally crack tonight.
 Maybe I could pull the dress off after all.
 Everyone would be so busy looking at the other three girls that they wouldn't even notice me.
 It wasn't ideal, but it was better than nothing.
 A quiet knock brought us all around to find Jessica waiting at the door, her makeup and hair partway done, a dress bag slung over her arm.

BG:  	Yeah.
 There’s a run-through version of “Wendy Ward.”  An a cappella version of “Yummy Yummy Yummy.” (laughs)  I don’t know where the hell that came from.
 Or what possible interest there would be in including it.
 We must have been high.
 There’s a live version of “A Bunch of Lonesome Heroes.”  The Leonard Cohen song.
 We used to play it live in a revved up version that I re-arranged.
 That’s pretty cool.
 Reason enough probably to buy the whole record.
 Uh, “Strictly Blowjob.”  That’s a song I wrote, Jesus, I think I was about 15.

I knew where we were because I had been here before.
 “Seth, I was here in my dream, the one with Kojas and the dwarf,” I said.
 His eyes widened and he looked down at the ground below, obviously trying to imagine what it had looked like.
 I had seen it and I was seriously scarred for my life.
 “You sure?” he asked.
 “You know that this means that Kojas was here, so he can’t be too far away.” “Don’t get your hopes up.
 I saw him once and I have no intention of being near him anytime soon.” He sat on the edge, the wind tossing around his hair.
 It was going to be seriously wind-blown later.
 I sat down next to him and I was trying to forget the dwarf’s mangled body.
 I shook and hugged myself.

It was a six-hour drive from where my grandparents and uncle lived.
 We said our goodbyes to our sobbing grandmother and to all our friends and entered a new chapter in our lives.
 I was in the fifth grade; Thomas was in sixth.
 Chapter 5: Connections My disposable cell phone rings and it is Ashley.
 She tries to get me to change my location and meet her at her apartment across town.
 “I am waiting where I fucking told you I would wait.
 I am not moving anywhere,” I hissed into the crack-berry—my nickname for the phone.
 The thought of walking into some apartment and getting clunked over the head for drugs is not an option.
 This is the second time Steve and Ashley are supposed to meet me for this buy, and the last time they decided not to show after I wasted hours listening to their phone calls buying more time or trying to get me to drive somewhere else.
 “I have no intention of moving anywhere, so get your shit together or this deal is off.” I tell her this is her last chance to get the Oxy and I will be waiting in the spot I told her.

Alec's almost imperceptible nod sent him in the same direction as Jessica.
 Whatever meager survival instincts I had left chose that moment to finally kick in, and I felt my knees begin to give way.
 Rachel let out a high-pitched sound that had all of the surprise of a squeal, but none of the excitement.
 Apparently Alec knew how to interpret it.
 He turned back and caught me again before I could hit the ground.
 "There isn't anything to worry about now.
 Go ahead and catch your breath."
 As pleasant as it was to be in his arms again, I was starting to worry he'd get tired of it.
 I pushed him away as soon as I was reasonably confident my knees would support me.
 "What's going on?

The horns were curled into his black bushy hair which was long, very thick, and very wild.
 It was sticking out in weird ways from his head.
 All the guards had been confused as to why Ravenhurr had kept him, as it was against the Guild rules to use any of the Hellborn in the ceremony.
 The Immortalist was trying to become Celestial not a member of the Infernal realms.
 It was a very stringent rule that everyone knew not to break, not that any of the guards was going to mention it to the Guild.
 “Who are you?” asked the man that Rodregas had tagged as ‘the leader.’ “I am not sure who I am,” Rodregas responded.
 “And I think I will keep any answers that I figure out to myself for now.” “You are not Gerald though are you?” asked the AElf maiden.
 “Not to ask a dumb question,” Rodregas asked in a curious tone “but who is Gerald?”  Silence followed his query but finally he got an answer.
 “He is the man that you appear to be, whose body you now… have,” responded the maiden.
 “And what are you five named?” Rodregas asked.

“Ever seen one of these before?” she asked.
 The half-orc stared at it, thinking.
 Suddenly he knew, and he looked at Aurelia in total disbelief.
 “Is that a book?”
 The elf nodded.
 “Is it a safe assumption that you don’t know how to read?”
 Harruq frowned at the book.
 “You’re not going to teach me elvish, are you?”
 Aurelia gave him a playful jab to the side.
 “No, it is in the gods’ language, your gods anyway.

That and he hated dad from the beginning because dad isn’t a religious person, and that dad had the audacity to question anything grandpa said.
 They didn’t get along at all.
 It’s amazing that mom and dad actually got married.
 He spent years trying to talk mom into out of dating dad, and finally he all but disowned her when they got married.
 Johnny – That’s news to me.
 Jim - They didn’t talk about it all that much.
 Johnny – Then how did you find out about it?
 Jim – Oh the usual way.
 Johnny – Which is?
 Jim – I did a lot of snooping around and eavesdropping.

“Fair enough.” “Okay then, see you two later.” Jason turned around with Seth on his heels.
 “Wait a minute you two.
 It’s only,” I popped open my phone, “3pm.
 We still have the rest of the day.” I shoved the phone back in my pocket.
 “Hey, don’t take this personally, but we want to hang out alone.
 So…bye!” Jason said and jumped on his bike.
 Seth unchained his bike and rode off with him.
 I realized then that Seth had barely said anything the whole time, but he was already out of sight.
 I’d have to question him later.
 I sighed, “Well, at least we can hang out early.” “Well, while you were arguing with the boys I called home and they said you could come over now.” Emily flashed me one of her million-watt smiles.

It’s all the anger.
 If you keep going on the way that you have, you’ll end up dieing alone.
 Eugene – Just like my father.
 My grandmother told me that he was an angry kid.
 Johnny – Yeah, but he managed to get married.
 Eugene – I wish he hadn’t.
 Jim – If he hadn’t then you would have never been born.
 Eugene – I know, it’s a paradox.
 Is it better to live, but to live through years of pain and misery?
 Or is it preferable never to have been born in the first place?

Steed’s laugh was loud.
 “She’s a hoot!” Chevelle looked as though he could be in danger of losing his temper.
 I didn’t get the joke.
 “You’re serious?” Steed said, humor vanished as he gaped at Chevelle.
 “What, she’s a bright lighter?” Chevelle was across the gap and in his face almost before Steed could stand.
 I jerked back in response, but a screeching siren pierced my ears and I doubled over, covering them.
 It was inside, a screaming, terrible howl coming from my ears.
 I tried to force my eyes open, hoping someone would help me, but they were just standing there, chest to chest, arguing.
 Did they not see me?
 I ached to scream for help, but couldn’t get a sound out, couldn’t breathe.

“Ow!
 It may be green but I still value it!” I grumbled, trying to pull my head free.
 I also had no desire to be bald at 16.
 “He’s rising, he’s rising!” The dwarf said excitedly.
 His voice cracked at the last word.
 “Who the heck is rising and why does it require pulling my hair out!” I snapped.
 “He’s rising, he’s rising!” he repeated, full of crazed excitement.
 I swear I could feel him shaking from exhilaration.
 “Whatever, you’re now an official maniac.” I pulled out my hunting knife.
 “Maniacs get destroyed by me.

Chevelle’s voice was barely audible as he spoke to his visitor in a formal tone.
 “Ruby.” Ruby?
 Before I could stop myself, I was at the door peering through the frame.
 A tiny crack of light allowed me about three-quarters of Chevelle’s back and all of his guest.
 Ruby.
 She looked to be a little shorter than me, a little smaller, but seemed larger somehow.
 I thought I knew why.
 Around her petite face, by some means both wicked and charming, was a mane of deep crimson hair flowing in curls.
 I considered her name, given that mass of hair, but any sympathy disappeared as she reached out a hand toward Chevelle.
 There was something sinful about it, the way her hand turned seductively in the simple task of retrieving the stone from him.

His finger froze.
 "I'm sorry--I should never have pushed you.
 I know that you're engaged, and I know--" "But that's it.
 That's what I'm talking about.
 I can't marry Davis."
 His eyes widened, and he seized her in his arms.
 "Oh, sweetheart, that's fantastic!"
 He took her face in his hands and rained kisses on her mouth.
 "I couldn't bear to lose you."
 He threaded his fingers into her hair, nuzzling her temple.

He tried to once more roll to the side, struggling away from a potential final stroke.
 Rodregas’ face was covered in gore and blood.
 It was hard for him to see.
 He struggled back up, but fell, then Rodregas felt a presence to his right.
 It was too small to be Doi’van and Rodregas staggered over reaching for him, determined to take one final slaver with him.
 His wounded leg buckled again, and Rodregas tried to reach for the ground to slow his fall, but something was wrong with his arm and it did not move.
 For a split second he saw the ground coming up to hit him in the face.
 And then... darkness.
 CHAPTER 10 THE OTHER KIND OF PAIN
 Rodregas laid there looking at blue swirls for a long time, wondering where he was.

We heal fast, and he heals faster than most."
 "So this isn't normal?"
 Dom shook her head again.
 "No, in most packs, any confrontation ends in violence.
 Generally there are a whole host of dominants who want to become the alpha.
 This would usually turn into a real dominance fight, with the other two doing their very best to kill him before turning on each other to fight over the spoils."
 "That's terrible."
 Her nod was sad.
 "I told you he was special.

Imeralda squatted down next to them and whispered, “A slave caravan is coming; it’s small but they have a score of guards.
 We need to back up before they get here.” “We have good cover here,” he whispered back, “let’s check them out as they pass.
 They are probably going to stop at Stallion’s Perch.” After much debate between the three of them Stallion’s Perch was their destination, a small keep that was known to breed Dire horses for the Immortal Guard.
 “We can’t,” responded Imeralda with a whisper.
 “They are traveling with a patrol of Immortal guards.
 I think there are only four, but scout patrols often have a warrior with a minor sigil of enhanced senses.
 He might spot us.” As she spoke Rodregas noticed that Imeralda had a strange expression on her face, she was scared, but also seemed sad.
 “What kind of slaves do they have?” Rodregas asked in a gentle voice.
 Her body jerked more directly toward him, surprise covering her sad expression for a second.
 “Mixed, of course, human, AElfin.

She had a thick, beautiful Spanish accent.
 For a second I was torn between complimenting her on it and asking her what cielos meant.
 I finally just settled on faking a smile and thanking her.
 She smiled at me.
 "No need to thank me.
 My name is Dominic by the way."
 A few seconds later I was standing alone, nervously facing my house.
 Alec suddenly appeared at my side.
 I jumped a little at the surprise.
 "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."

 I stood there and stared at him.
 “Please Jazell, let me tell them myself,” he begged.
 I waited for him to let go, but his grip stayed firm and strong.
 I stared at him.
 “Fine but I'm tired of waiting, Seth.” “I know, I promise I'll tell them,” He stood up, his grip still tight.
 “I just don't think now is the right time.
 After something like falling out of the sky, I don't want to bring more bad news.” I sighed.
 “Alright, I'll leave this to you.
 But I swear...” “I will, I promise you!” he interrupted me.

Strength in fields and spirit meant little compared to the might of a warrior conducting the dark god’s power.
 Condemnation tore through his rusted sickle, cut his arm from his body, and then hooked around, severing his ankles.
 The boy fell, dying in four pieces.
 Jeremiah knew then he would enter the golden eternity before the dawn.
 Someone swung a torch while another man thrust his short sword.
 The half-orc shattered the sword with a savage swipe while ignoring the torch as it smashed across his leather armor.
 He roared as he chopped that man’s head into pieces.
 The dropped torch sputtered and died.
 All the courage he could muster failed to move Jeremiah forward.
 He watched the raging warrior butcher friend after friend, so many having never seen their eighteenth winter.

While the worst fears about rising unemployment in the West have been dispelled, the challenge of generating sufficient employment opportunities for all people around the world remains a pressing concern.
 The rich-poor divide has increased within and between nations.
 Inadequate job/livelihood opportunities resulting in inadequate purchasing power have now become the most important cause of endemic and hidden hunger.
 Most regrettable has been the failure to enhance the powers and strengthen reliance on effective multilateral institutions.
 The emergence of the USA as the sole superpower has brought with it a reduction in the role and influence of the UN in international affairs, precisely at a time when the world should be striving to build a viable multilateral cooperative security system.
 The Unfinished Agenda
 The Commission’s report was never intended to predict what would happen in the years to come, but rather to project what could be made to happen by a concerted, determined effort of the world community.
 The report highlighted many of the opportunities that did emerge as well as some of the dangers that have grown in intensity in the absence of effective action.
 The events of the past 15 years may not have followed the course predicted by either the optimists or the pessimists, but they certainly confirm that this has been a period of unprecedented opportunity for rapid progress – what Sri Aurobindo termed an “Hour of God”.
 While the gains have been significant, all of us will acknowledge that we have not taken full advantage of this opportunity to build a better world.

The only other person I'd ever met who could've even come close to pulling off such an innocent expression was Rachel, and I wasn't sure even she could compete with Dominic today.
 If I'd found her standing in front of a broken window with a rock in her hand, and she'd told me she had no idea why the window had shattered, all the while flashing me that look, I would've believed her.
 Mrs. Tiggs apparently wasn't quite so gullible.
 "It's a reasonable question, as the two subjects are highly related.
 One could almost say they're so close to the same thing that any distinction is purely arbitrary."
 Now Dominic looked both innocent and confused.
 "But why are they so far apart in the book then?
 I mean my Spanish book in the school before I came here had them pretty widely spaced too."
 It was masterful.
 I'm not even sure the rest of the class realized the pattern, but Mrs. Tiggs caught on about halfway through the hour.

Rumor was that the Guild Master (and maybe Taiga as well) was close to ascension to true godhood.
 Only two Immortalists had ever succeeded in this task.
 The first was the legendary Accerntorino.
 He was said to have created the Immortalist Ascension ritual and to have been a genius without par.
 The first guild master Accerntorino was also known for his ego.
 Within two decades of his accession he challenged the All-Father Allód for control of the Celestial Pantheon of the Gods.
 Accerntorino claimed he could better lead them to victory over the Daemon Lords of the Infernal Realm.
 But Allód quickly and soundly defeated the upstart Accerntorino.
 What still caused whispers almost 400 years later was his fate; the All-Father had destroyed him.
 Everyone knew stories of various gods that had challenged Allód over the millennia.

Thomas and I had never heard someone speak in a foreign language so it was intriguing.
 My mom soon married Dino and we officially had a stepfather.
 Shortly after they were married we moved north to Sacramento.
 It was a six-hour drive from where my grandparents and uncle lived.
 We said our goodbyes to our sobbing grandmother and to all our friends and entered a new chapter in our lives.
 I was in the fifth grade; Thomas was in sixth.
 Chapter 5: Connections My disposable cell phone rings and it is Ashley.
 She tries to get me to change my location and meet her at her apartment across town.
 “I am waiting where I fucking told you I would wait.
 I am not moving anywhere,” I hissed into the crack-berry—my nickname for the phone.

 To have his friendship dangled out in front of me only to be yanked away a heartbeat later was somehow crueler than I'd ever guessed it would be.
 It all fit together though.
 Jasmin had told him I'd overheard her death threats, and he'd decided to use his good looks to convince me to keep quiet.
 Only he hadn't been able to keep the act up for more than just a few seconds.
 I must really repulse him.
 Physics was my own little personal hell for the next forty minutes.
 I absorbed absolutely nothing from the rest of the discussion about calculating mechanical advantage, and when we were finally released into our groups Alec and I didn't even look each other in the eyes.
 I gutted out the last five minutes by pretending I was completely absorbed in a reference book while Alec started running preliminary calculations.
 He was out of his seat and halfway to the door by the time I'd even realized the bell had rung to dismiss us.

Liz – Just after her fight with father.
 Jim – She fled into Gene’s awaiting arms?
 Must have been one terrible fight.
 Eugene – Hey!
 Liz – What is with that woman and trying to seduce my friends?
 Jim – Better Gene than me!
 Liz – Jim!
 Eugene – What’s that supposed to mean?
 Jim – What?
 It was creepy getting hit on by your mother.

We removed every wire, rubber seal, window felt, and had boxes full of zip-lock baggies that were marked with a Sharpie what the part was and where it had come from.
 When Brandon was about fifteen, we went to Hot August Nights in Reno, a huge hot rod auto show.
 We wandered through these aisles of incredible cherry vehicles and talked about how someday ours could be alongside these beauties.
 This project would prove to be a huge challenge that would last seven-plus years, partly because it coincided with the start of Brandon’s drug use.
 What started as a project he was very enthusiastic about became an afterthought to time with friends and partying.
 He would show up for certain monumental events like when we put the body back on the frame after it was painted, but I was pretty much on my own with it for a bit.
 My wife was a champ as “that thing” (her nick-name for it) sat in a million pieces in the garage for so long.
 Seeing Brandon heading down the wrong path, I knew only what not to do.
 I had no idea what to do.
 I remember a lesson I learned while coaching youth sports.

I heard my dad’s band exactly once.
 I don’t remember why.
 We had to go to The Vapors for something and mom plunked me down in a chair and said, just stay here, I’ll be back.
 Well, it was like the music held me there—she could have been gone for hours.
 I was riveted.
 And there was my dad, looking cool, and blowing beautiful, liquid melodies out of that licorice stick.
 Sweet stuff.
 “Canadian Sunset,” “Old Brown Jug,” “St.
 Louis Blues,” “Blues for Allen Felix.”  It was a revelation.
 But, never to be repeated.

Rodregas feared for her.
 He was not sure what the consequences would be if she touched the One Tree.
 He wanted to follow her, but he followed Doi’van into the Infernal chamber instead.
 “Was it his own Infernal power calling him?” He wondered.
 Rodregas and Doi’van circled the chamber.
 Rodregas was not as familiar with the daemons of the Infernal Realms as he was the great beasts of the Celestial Realm.
 He sat looking at a wolf with the tail of a serpent but with large beautiful white wings.
 Then he slowly walked next to a great bull with bat wings and a head that appeared to be very human.
 While he had been drawn to the Chamber both figures repulsed him.
 They mocked the natural order.

"Rick."
 She played with a curl on his forehead.
 He turned away from her hand, so she tickled his ear with her fingernail.
 His eyes finally opened, and he blinked up at her, smiling lazily.
 "Good morning."
 "Good morning."
 "Time to go walking in the garden?"
 "No--it's too late for that.
 I overslept.

"Nope, if you want to find out, you'll have to come to it with me."
 "You know, I don't usually leave conversations midway through.
 You really can let go of me."
 "Maybe, but I'm enjoying holding onto you."
 I forcefully removed his hand as I shook my head.
 "Boys.
 You're all the same.
 Okay.
 Assuming my mom takes off for the night, I'll go, but only on the condition that you behave."
 I managed to make it to the door without my knees knocking together, but it was a close thing.

“Interesting.
 Do I get one too?”
 In answer, Aurelia smacked her staff against Harruq’s shin.
 The half-orc roared in pain as he hopped up and down on one foot.
 “Damn it!” he shouted.
 “What was that for?”
 “Hitting you is my reward for doing well,” she said.
 “Consider it my way of making sure you don’t go easy on me.
 So are you ready to begin?”
 Harruq mumbled something obscene.

His eyes, a light blue, stared at Rodregas with revulsion.
 He was probably wondering how Rodregas could be strong enough to take on an Immortal Guard.
 Rodregas knew from the guard’s fear that he had him, he was not thinking clearly.
 Rodregas growled at him, letting him feel his anger and rage at taking slaves to be used by the Immortalists.
 Rodregas had seen what would happen to them.
 He had suffered for years with a subtle kind of inner rot at letting the evil continue.
 In all the ways that mattered Rodregas knew he was no better than this man, he had spent most of his life as a slaver.
 Rodregas had no moral grounds on which to kill these men, but inside of him there was no mercy.
 He had crossed a line and could no longer live with the evil.
 Rodregas let go of the guard’s shield.

That song stems from a conversation we were having about the past, about the future.
 You know, it’s so damn hard to live in the moment, isn’t it?
 I mean, it’s that Zen thing, you know?
 You wanna stay present, but the past keeps intruding.
 “Right on Poplar Avenue,” pun intended, is about this girlfriend I use to have—well, she wasn’t really a girlfriend, I guess—she was one of those people you come up against in your life where you’re just beating your head against a wall.
 For whatever reason you just aren’t connecting.
 This woman, beautiful woman, was a flirt, no kidding, I mean, she made eyes at me across this restaurant, this vegetarian restaurant, and I couldn’t figure out what she was doing.
 I was a little dense—this was, oh, I don’t know, before Lorelei, before we really hit big.
 And, then afterwards, one of those driving home epiphanies, I figured out who she was, and that she was looking at me because she recognized me and expected me to recognize her.
 So, I was a bit embarrassed and when I got home, I called her.

"Sorry, I know she's your friend.
 I shouldn't say things like that, but that's really what she's doing.
 By the time the actual dance arrives, everyone who is anyone will have a date, most of them picked out by the girl weeks before the boy even started thinking about the dance."
 There wasn't really any bitterness in her voice, but there was something, maybe the same kind of longing I felt when I talked about Prom.
 "You're probably right.
 That would fit with what I know of Britney so far."
 "Do you need us to give you a ride?"
 I looked over and saw that James was once again glaring at me, somehow having approached to within a few feet without making any noise.
 "I should probably make sure she isn't waiting somewhere for me.
 That's probably half of why she's so mad.

 "May I sleep here on the sofa?

 He went to search through the refrigerator and the cabinets.

I don't know, people don't say very much about her.
 She's got an incredible temper though."
 "She's dating Alec right?"
 Britney nodded emphatically.
 "I've never seen them kiss or hold hands, but they've got to be.
 She's totally rebuffed everyone, and he's never evidenced even the slightest interest in any other girl.
 Plus, they're like the two hottest people in the entire school.
 How could they possibly date anyone else?"
 It was hard to argue with that.
 Jasmin was the kind of brunette who disproved the old saying that gentlemen prefer blondes.

In 1993, the average market price of the debt was about 30 cents on the dollar.
 This market discount was a major factor in the decision to scale down the debt of Latin American countries by an average of 15 per cent and of Egypt and Poland by 50 per cent.
 The aggregate debt of the 61 debt-affected countries with low and lower-middle income is roughly equal to that of the half-dozen mostly middle-income countries assisted under the Brady Plan.
 Scaling down the debt of these poor countries by an average of 70 per cent would be appropriate in view of their economic plight, though the actual reduction would have to be negotiated on a case by case basis.
 In order to be of sufficient magnitude, debt reduction should be applied to all three major classes of creditors: bilateral official creditors, private sector lenders and international organizations.
 Debt reduction should be linked to each country's specific programmes for poverty eradication and meeting the minimum needs of the people.
 7.Commodity prices: The problem of debt is closely linked to that of international commodity prices.
 The majority of developing countries are dependent on the export of primary products for their welfare and growth.
 These products account for 80–90 per cent of the exports of African countries, and 65 per cent in the case of Latin American nations.
 The extreme price volatility of commodity markets is especially damaging to low-income countries, which, regardless of the price, are forced to sell their products to meet minimum needs and pay debts.

He simply rode as he always did, with intermittent glances in each direction, as if I weren’t even there.
 In truth, he hadn’t appeared to notice my behavior at all.
 When I finally broke the silence, we were navigating a narrow pass.
 “How long will we be riding?” I wasn’t specific in my question, not wanting to reveal I had no idea where we were headed.
 If he’d been under the false impression he’d had to take me, I wasn’t about to mess that up only to be dragged back to the village.
 Especially after everything that had happened.
 My horse quickened his pace to ride alongside his and I made a mental note to learn how to control the horse on my own.
 The constricted path forced us close together, our stirrups and legs brushing as we rode.
 Chevelle nodded at my hand and I held it out, palm up.
 Chevelle indicated a spot on one of the mountains.

A toss of his hand and the elf flew through the air.
 He rolled across the ground without the usual grace he had shown in combat.
 Qurrah glanced about, paralyzed with fear.
 The remaining elves were returning, deadly and furious, and the darkness that had protected them was gone.
 “Do you feel it?” Velixar said, stalking over to the dying elf.
 “The blood in your throat is clotting.
 Your mind will starve and your heart will burst trying to force blood through.”
 He knew he should speak.
 He had to warn master.
 But he could not open his mouth.

A grin spread wide across his ever-changing face, chilling Harruq’s spine.
 “If the humans win, the elves will declare full scale war against the kingdom of Neldar.
 So which side do you think will have the privilege of our blades and magic?”
 “We will kill the elves,” Harruq said.
 The man in black nodded and then dismissed his bone general.
 “Go.
 Patch your wounds.”
 The half-orc bowed and then joined his brother.
 The two journeyed across the hills and then snuck inside Woodhaven.
 When they reached their home, Harruq removed his armor and began wrapping strips of old cloth around his wounds.

Sooner than we imagined, the basic power of the universe would be given into the hands of mad men.
 Then, how could our planet avoid destruction?
 And he told us a Chicago judge claimed our generation’s teenaged criminals made Al Capone's gang look like a Sunday school class.
 A flutter of auburn hair caught my eye.
 I looked down and noticed goose bumps on the babe’s shoulders.
 After traveling the world and witnessing racial tensions rising all around, Billy Graham had grown ever more certain that the only solution was at the foot of the cross.
 He said the foot of the cross was the only place where in every sense all of us are equals.
 We’re all sinners, he said, and we’re sinners by choice.
 We choose to break God's moral laws.
 We become drunkards or fornicators, selfish, consumed with pride and prejudice and intolerance.

I had a pair of heartbeats to wonder at the strange tricks my subconscious was playing on me, and then the dream started fading away.
 The heavenly surroundings were predictably the first thing to disappear, leaving afterimages of light burned into the corners of my vision.
 Alec was the next thing to go, but the memory of his features clung to my mind long after I found myself in a featureless void.
 Stranger still, his scent stayed with me even longer.
 I was just self-aware enough to hope I'd remember it all when I awoke in the morning.
 Chapter 5 It was a good thing I'd started school in the middle of the week.
 If I'd gone to school the next day after all the drama of learning about our mortgage problems I probably would have had a nervous breakdown.
 As it was, I was essentially worthless all weekend.
 I tried to warn Mom about the animals that'd mauled the kids from school, but she told me she was already aware of the incident and left before I could draw her into a discussion of what we should do about the bank.
 I saw her for maybe a total of three hours during the entire two days.

Once again, therefore, we see the inescapable relations governing the goals of peace, development and democratization these are the goals of the United Nations.
 The United Nations has, over the years, devoted great time and attention to the issues before the Commission on Peace and Food.
 In the research, analysis, debate, consensus-building and actual operational activities of the United Nations System, the issues of peace, develop ment and democratization have been at the forefront.
 The Members of the International Commission on Peace and Food have interacted closely with the United Nations Funds, Programmes and Specialized Agencies.
 This report brings together many of the issues which are central to the reflection on development which the United Nations is trying to encourage, leading to the World Summit on Social Development to be held in 1995.
 Boutros Boutros-Ghali Secretary General United Nations
 The report of the International Commission on Peace and Food focuses on the 'uncommon opportunities' that have arisen as the world shifts into new alignments.
 These include the chance to tackle the problems of hunger and injustice at the root of so many of the global challenges confronting us not the least, the overriding challenge of nurturing a worldwide culture of peace.
 The Commission has put people first, recognizing that the greatest potential for change is within us, that with education and information we can mobilize the vast amounts of energy and skill which are currently wasted in the scramble for survival.
 It, nevertheless, also accepts that there are no easy solutions and that concerted action is necessary on many fronts in order to untangle the tortuous connections between, for instance, defence spending and food security, for no country can truly be said to be at peace while the violence of hunger blights the life of its citizens.

She knew the moment she struck with a spell her invisibility would end.
 She wondered how he would look at her when she killed him.
 Surprise?
 Anger?
 Shame?
 She didn’t know.
 She didn’t want to know.
 Magic sparked on her fingertips.
 Harruq might have seen if he had looked over, but his eyes stared through the window.
 He pulled back the sword.

 The two brothers were almost to the wall when the skulls flew overhead.
 “Make them stop!” cried Harruq Tun, hands pressed against his ears.
 Beside him, Qurrah Tun stood mesmerized by the sight.
 Hundreds of skulls bathed in purple fire sailed over the walls of Veldaren like dark comets.
 Gaping mouths shrieked mindless wails, their voices bone-chilling and unrelenting.
 A few soldiers fired arrows, but most hid behind their shields.
 “Why do you cower?” Qurrah asked, striking his brother on the shoulder.
 “The skulls are nuisances, nothing more.”
 “Sorry,” Harruq muttered.

I watched Ruby’s heeled boots as she led me through the main room and to the door to her bedroom.
 “A bath?” I asked, confused.
 She laughed.
 “Well, yes.
 A little cold for lake bathing here.” She led me to a large basin in the corner of her room.
 Water streamed in from the window and filled it halfway.
 “I’ve laid out some clothes for you and there are some lovely soaps on the table.” She spun and glided out of the room, closing the door behind her, and all I could think was, Lovely soaps.
 I examined the room as I undressed.
 A large bed topped with decorated pillows and colorful blankets centered the opposite wall, twice the size of the one I’d been using.
 A tall rack in the corner was draped with materials—deep violet and emerald-green silks, dark wools, and a rainbow of patterned scarves.

“No gory details.” His eyebrow cocked meaningfully.
 “Oh, well, yes, that would do.” She smiled at me as she licked another arrow, tongue sliding carefully along the blade.
 “You see, my dear, being a one of a kind—well, as far as I know—has its benefits.
 Though they weren’t always benefits.
 Ooh, in the beginning it was bad… but, well, that’s the long version, isn’t it?
 No gory details.” She winked at Steed.
 “I am, how should I put it… venomous.” I gasped.
 It was her expected response.
 “Yes, yes.
 I know.” She held her tongue out for me to examine.

“Glad to give you something to remember the town by,” she said.
 After a flirtatious flip of her hair, she started down the street.
 Aurelia froze, her blood as cold as when she had sensed the man in black.
 This time no magic could be blamed, and no sense of death.
 No, it was just the sight of Harruq, dressed in black armor and wielding ancient blades dripping with blood.
 Just the sight of him massacring an elven warrior.
 “Oh, Harruq,” she whispered.
 Then he saw her, and all time stopped.

Part of you still yearns to do what your ancestors have done.
 They reveled in bloodshed, warred against men who followed a false god.
 I offer you a chance to do as you were meant to and serve Karak.
 Answer me this question, half-orc.
 Do you love your brother?”
 A chill ran through his spine.
 He glanced to Qurrah, who still knelt.
 His eyes were focused on him.
 In them, he saw pride.
 “Aye, I do,” Harruq said.

He's mine again, and if you're not out of sight in the next five minutes I'll kill you myself and end this stupid experiment once and for all."
 I'd only heard that kind of blatant willingness to kill once before, and just like with Jasmin, I was absolutely convinced Cassie was serious.
 I wanted to get up, to do something other than just lie shaking on the rocks, but my mind was like an appliance with stripped gears.
 It was spinning but not grabbing onto anything, so nothing was happening.
 Cassie picked me up with one hand and gave me a hard shove back towards the road.
 I almost fell.
 Considering just how rugged the terrain was, it was a good thing I didn't, because I probably would've broken my neck.
 It was still a near thing, but once I was moving reflex kept me headed in the right direction.
 Tears were flowing freely down my cheeks, and my heart seemed to be missing every second beat, almost like a hole had been torn in it and now it was a battle to continue beating, when it just wanted to quit.
 I did fall down when I hit the first slope.

Vincent's sadistic smile sent shivers down my spine, but it was nothing compared to Brandon's expression.
 I'd known for a couple of weeks now that what the outside world saw was nothing more than a mask, but I hadn't realized just what was under the facade.
 Now I knew.
 It was like he'd spent the last few days peeling back some of the layers that'd hidden him, and the sheer inhumanity waiting underneath completely distracted me from the throbbing in my ankle.
 He held Britney before him, ostensibly caressing her, but in reality using her as a shield, his dark eyes daring Alec to attack.
 Britney was apparently unable to sense the crackling power surrounding her.
 She looked completely unconcerned, ecstatic even to be where she was, clasped in Brandon's left arm.
 Brandon's lips drew back, but it wasn't in a smile, it was the human equivalent to showing his hackles.
 "Break it up!
 You kids back off!"

“What was the point of pushing me over, Jazell?” “Well, it seemed better than punching you in the side.
 Were you dreaming?” I asked.
 He shook his head.
 “Just a bunch of nonsense I don't even remember.
 Why, did you get another vision?” “Yes,” I said.
 “It was with the same voice that was in my last dream.
 Only this time, I talked to the ghost girl.” “You did?
 What did she say?” “She hinted that she knew who made us this way and who attacked us that day,” I said.
 “She also said that Kojas would use our emotions against us and try to get us to come to him.” Something dark crossed Seth's face.
 “She also said that we were chosen because of our strong bond, but she said, not to test it,” I continued.

“Look, Frey, I don’t know if you’re up for this story right now.” I didn’t think she was funny.
 She sighed.
 “Okay, but you’ll probably regret it.” “Just give her the short version, Ruby,” Steed interrupted.
 “No gory details.” His eyebrow cocked meaningfully.
 “Oh, well, yes, that would do.” She smiled at me as she licked another arrow, tongue sliding carefully along the blade.

A boy.
 My boy.
 Brandon.
 And he had all his fingers and all his toes, and he let out a bellow so excruciating it could curdle milk.
 Many changes, challenges and compromises in our marriage would soon follow.
 Many difficult times required me to recall the moment I first saw Lisa.
 A second son, Bryce, was added to our family two years later.
 I have tried to explain to my friends with no children yet that having children changes everything suddenly.
 Every day, sometimes every second, delivers a new challenge.
 As much as they want me to tell them what to expect, I cannot prepare them, as no one could have ever prepared me.

It was time.
 It was time for music to mean something.
 Dylan, The Beatles, they led the way.
 They said, you know, show us the plan, you don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.
 And the kids sat up and listened.
 It was coming, this revolution of meaning, this concentration on the word.
 And, all along, behind it like a dark river, ran the beat, the melody, a sort of communication device that was both insidious and right out there in the open.
 See, rock wasn’t subversive to the people who wanted to know.
 It didn’t trick anybody.
 It’s the most godawful honest music on the planet.

The class was in a section of the building I hadn't been to yet, one apparently older than the rest of the building.
 The lights were spaced further apart and the cinder blocks in the walls were a slightly different size.
 Good thing I still had my water.
 The old part of the school was just as hot as the rest.
 You'd think functioning air-conditioning would be a necessity for a school so far south.
 At least it should cool down a little in the coming months.
 Assuming of course I lasted that long without losing it from dealing with all of the crazy small-town people in this school.
 I entered the classroom and was immediately greeted by a portly, white-haired woman.
 "Hello, hello.
 My name is Mrs. Alexander, and you must be Adri.

Teri--"  He caught himself.
 Marie would be embarrassed if she thought Teri and Jeremy had seen them kissing.
 "Mmm."
 She kissed him again.
 Rick returned her kiss and then gently disengaged her arms.
 "It's getting late.
 We need to get home."
 He helped her into the car.
 "I think I like 1927 cars better than 2011 cars," Marie said as Rick slid behind the wheel.
 "Why?"

I glared at him.
 “Time to resume your training.” They had me work with Anvil, trying to anticipate when he was preparing to send a small current of electricity toward me.
 Which meant I spent the day getting shocked.
 I was grateful when we finally stopped to make camp.
 I was afraid they would resume training after dinner, so I found a place off by myself and pretended to rest as I went back to reading the diary.
 Today was exhilarating.
 For the first time in I don’t know how long, I was out of the castle.
 Free from practice, free from duties, free from walls.
 Though tricky to set up, the spell worked on Rune.
 I showed up at practice early and whispered the words in case something went wrong and he heard.

Jordaan glanced over to him as if asking for permission and Rodregas nodded his ok. Jordaan reached down and carefully picked up the small frog and cupped it in his hands.
 His eyes were closed in concentration.
 He looked up at Rodregas with a confused expression and asked, “Do you know what this is?” “Not really, I found it in Raven Keep.
 It felt of magic so I took it.
 I thought it might be worth something.” Jordaan smiled and laughed as he said, “Worth something indeed.
 This is a minor Sigil of Healing.” It was Rodregas who gasped this time and said, “Infernals!
 We had a Sigil of Healing all this time?
 If we had inscribed this sigil back at the farm we would never have needed your help.” Jordaan nodded at the truth of Rodregas’ words and the two of them quickly gathered the others.
 All agreed that no matter what might happen with the greater sigils that all should gain the minor Sigil of Healing.
 Its benefits to warriors and mages alike were well known.

“I must go.” “Wait!” I called.
 “Wait; tell me what's going on!
 Tell me what we're supposed to do!” But she was already gone.
 *** I opened my eyes and the cold of the morning bit at my cheeks.
 Seth was fast asleep next to me, his blue hair covering half his face.
 Emily was curled up a few feet away from me.
 Jason turned in his sleep, mumbling something unintelligent.
 I needed to talk to someone, but everyone was sleeping.
 I pushed Seth over and his eyes flew open.
 His hand went to his sword but he saw me and he relaxed.

They were silvery robes, beautiful and decadent.
 The spirit wailed.
 It took all of Harruq’s strength to resist the urge to cover his ears.
 “Cease such nonsense,” Qurrah ordered.
 The spirit immediately hushed.
 A bit of coherence came to his eyes, and he glared down at the half-orc.
 “Greetings, Ahrqur,” Qurrah said.
 “Remember us, the incompetent thieves?”
 The spirit glared harder.
 “Did his tongue die with him?” Harruq asked.

I could feel warm tingles start from my shoulders and work their way down my arms.
 A full two seconds of silence passed before I realized he'd asked me why I'd come downstairs.
 "I can't sleep.
 I've been trying, but I'm too wound up to do anything but just lie there.
 I thought I'd come downstairs and talk to you instead.
 I mean, unless it's bothering you.
 You know, keeping you from patrolling or something."
 That last bit hadn't really been planned.
 I'd wanted to come downstairs and talk to him, but wouldn't have dreamt of just saying it outright.
 Maybe it was the natural high I got simply from being around him.

“A heavy price,” Dieredon said, gingerly climbing atop Sonowin.
 “Heavy, but well worth its weight in blood.
 A great evil has left this land.
 Let us return to Woodhaven, for this place of death turns my mouth sour.”
 The two took to the air and joined the other survivors.
 They did not try to locate their dead among the hundreds of other rotting bodies.
 Instead, a few elves flew low and scattered firestones, small pebbles that burst into flame upon landing.
 Grass and bodies ignited, and the battlefield rapidly swelled into a giant funeral pyre.
 Qurrah crawled out from underneath the body as flames erupted all around him.
 Everywhere he looked, he saw embers and corpses.

It came back to me then.
 I dropped into a chair, my head falling into my hands to cover my face.
 Ruby started to say something, but Chevelle cut her off.
 “Won’t you offer your guest breakfast?” She sniffed.
 “Lunch maybe.” A plate of food landed on the table in front of me with a slap.
 “Thank you,” I managed.
 I was hungry, despite the embarrassment.
 I grabbed the plate and started eating.
 Ruby and Steed were sitting across from me.
 She was reclined, her bare legs showing where the material of her skirt was pulled to the side.

Anyways, I mostly just wanted to stop by and see if us girls can take you shopping tomorrow."
 The non sequitur really threw me for a loop.
 "I left my money at home.
 I'm not much of a shopper anyways."
 That last part sounded pretty weak even to me.
 "Don't be silly.
 Alec hustled you out of your house so quickly you didn't get to bring anything but the clothes on your back.
 Jasmin's clothes will fit you pretty well, but that's only a short-term solution.
 We need to get you stuff to wear, and since it was Alec who created this mess, it's only fair he be the one to pay."
 I was absolutely sure there was no way I was ever going to fit into anything Jasmin owned, but girls being girls, there was no point in protesting.

 "Of course I mean it.

He put a hand inside the window.
 The other pressed his sword against the side of the house.
 No longer a dream.
 A nightmare.
 She would kill him, burn his whole body to ash so she never had to look upon his dead face.
 Hatred burned in her breast.
 _Qurrah,_ she thought.
 _You make him do this.
 Put the blood on your own hands, you coward._
 She knew the moment she struck with a spell her invisibility would end.

 See ya.” Emily’s voice came back.
 “Well, who was it?” “It was Jason, he found the meeting place,” I said.
 “It’s the public art piece we use to climb.” “That makes sense.” She paused.
 “I have to go, dinner.” “Bye Emily,” I whispered.
 “See you tomorrow.” “Bye.” She clicked off.
 After dinner I was laying in bed, my mind spinning.
 I still couldn’t believe where I was going tomorrow.

 "Yes."
 She'd become so accustomed to being honest with him that she didn't even think about dissimulating.

 “I’ll try to keep him talking,” Aurelia said.
 “And I’ll find out more about his brother.
 I hope I can bear Harruq’s company in the meanwhile.
 He can be quite a brute sometimes.”
 “Come now,” Dieredon said, his face suddenly brightening into a smile.
 “He sounds like a real fine man to me.

He could feel power creeping out of his master, cold and fierce.
 Soft purple dust flew from his pale hands.
 “The trust between man and elf is broken,” Velixar said.
 “Let the harvest of their distrust begin.”
 Arcane words of power flowed from Velixar.
 Qurrah knew them, knew their purpose.
 They were the exact same words he had used to raise the eight undead at Cornrows.
 The only difference, however, was in the power Velixar gave them.
 Each word rolled forth like some unstoppable wave, deep and resonating.
 He relished the feel, knowing that one day he would speak the words in such a manner.

“What are they looking at?” Harruq later asked as the two brothers walked down the winding streets of Woodhaven.
 “Let us see,” said Qurrah.
 Harruq muscled his way past two men, his brother following in his wake.
 They found a proclamation nailed to a post.
 “What’s it say?” Harruq asked.
 “All children are to be kept outside the boundary of the forest,” Qurrah said, his eyes narrowing.
 “Six have been killed by the…”
 Qurrah laughed, a hideous sound.
 “By the what?” Harruq asked.
 “The Forest Butcher,” said an aged woman next to him, her voice creaking as if she had tiny pebbles lodged in her throat.

“Harruq,” he tried to call out.
 The flesh in the back of his throat tore.
 Blood poured down his throat, slick and hot.
 Qurrah cursed.
 Such a wound would kill him if he did not seek help.
 He needed to steal more life, and for that, he needed another body.
 He glanced behind.
 The dead elf was dry, but far down the street were two more he and his brother had killed.
 He glanced once more to Harruq.
 Three elves lay dead about him.

"I'm sorry, I'd like to go, but I just don't think I can.
 If it was running for an extra month or two I could probably save up enough money from tutoring, but it isn't, so it just isn't going to happen."
 Rachel nodded, and for a second it was easy to forget that she probably got more spending money each month than I'd see all year.
 "That's okay.
 Things like that are always coming through Vegas.
 We can just go the next time they come to town."
 I nodded and smiled, surprised that the thought of so much time trapped in a car with someone didn't make me want to run away screaming.
 Cars were scary.
 All that time with nothing to do but talk, and once you started talking to people they wanted to know things.
 Things that weren't any of their business, things you weren't ready to discuss.

Jim – You didn’t?
 Eugene – No!
 Liz – Then what are you talking about?
 Eugene – Well I was over at your house.
 Liz – I gathered that…
 Eugene – And I was wandering around looking for a bathroom.
 I found one.
 Jim – You walked in on her?
 Eugene – How was I supposed to know that she showered in the nude?
 Jim – That has got to be the dumbest thing I ever heard you say.

Lie to me if you must, just don’t expect me to believe it.
 Forgive me for hoping you could trust me.”
 The vines released, freeing the half-orc who smacked against the ground.
 By the time he picked himself up, the vines had pulled into the dirt.
 “I have something new planned for tomorrow,” she said.
 “Don’t be late.”
 “You’re going to pay for that,” he grumbled, rubbing his sore wrists after she was gone.
 His heart was not in it, though.
 More than anything, he was embarrassed and frightened about losing control.

 It’s not like I’m complaining about nothing.
 The fucking bitch hated me, and she let me know every day of my life.

His shoulders looked unnaturally tight and he was shaking his head slowly from side to side.
 Locked as I was into my course, I couldn't help but hear them both as I got closer.
 "I can't do this, Jasmin.
 I've been meaning to tell you for a while, but I was afraid of how you'd react."
 I half stumbled at the raw pain in his voice.
 While I was still trying to recover my balance, Jasmin looked up at me, and the force of her glare almost made me fall over my feet again.
 I'd seen plenty of girls try and warn off potential competition, but I'd never seen an expression that intense.
 Despite my earlier resolve, I couldn't help myself.
 I veered further away from the pair as some primitive, survival-minded part of my subconscious sought to create a buffer between me and the girl who looked ready to rip out my throat.
 I'd gone far enough I couldn't see either of them, but it honestly felt like Jasmin watched me all the way until I managed to make it safely out of sight.

And I have seen no reason to doubt that assessment.
 But if the call to relationship implies we should adore, I confess that truth has escaped me until now.
 I mean, we all know it's possible to have a relationship with someone we don't adore.
 But to have a relationship with Jesus and fail to adore him seems all wrong.
 Evil, maybe.
 After all, I adored Eric Curtis.
 A Trip
 I drive a lot, across the desert to visit my kids and grandson in Tucson, and all over the West and sometimes farther on vacations and book promotion tours.
 One reason I drive rather than fly is, I come closest to adoring God while on the road.
 Between cities, I plug in my I-pod.

No longer can non-combatants sit quietly on the sidelines or work productively undisturbed.
 War both between and within states has come to involve and affect all of society.
 Infrastructure and production facilities have become a principal target of military action.
 Food supplies are frequently the first major casualty and most lethal weapon.
 A single explosion can paralyze a major metropolis or contaminate an entire region with toxic material, dwarfing the devastation caused by the industrial accidents at Chernobyl and Bhopal.
 The disruption of trade resulting even from regional conflicts such as the Gulf War or the war in Bosnia, impacts not only on the economies of the belligerents, but also on neighbours, trading partners and global economic performance.
 Neither the victor nor the victim can any longer afford to resolve conflicts violently.
 Political states may still be able to survive wars, but developmental achievements can not.
 So long as the benefits of development are confined to one or a few sections of society, the costs of militarization and war may not prevent economic and social progress.
 But when the need is to fulfil the rising expectations of the masses by extending the benefits of development to the entire society – thus enabling the society as a whole to move to the next higher level of collective affluence and fulfilment – every social resource must be garnered and harnessed for this purpose.

He was sure she could feel the pounding of his heart when her hands strayed from the sunburnt spot.
 Swallowing, he said hoarsely, "You like touching me, don't you?"
 Her eyes met his briefly and then returned to follow the action of her hands.
 "Yes," she whispered.
 Rick's arms slid around her waist, and he bent his head to kiss her.
 Marie's hands continued to move over his chest as she returned his kiss.
 His lips were warm and strong, and his kiss made her heart flutter.
 She didn't feel the shyness she'd felt when they'd kissed before, and she was disappointed when Rick ended it.
 "Pizza," Rick muttered, gazing down into her dazed face.
 "Hmmm?"

Not an iron-clad one, but good enough for now.
 I thanked Brandon for the ride, and was rewarded with one more wide, open smile before we split up and headed our separate ways.
 I kept telling myself not to get caught up in the idea of being with someone for the first time in my life, but still went through the first two classes more or less in a daze.
 Mrs. Sorenson was just as nasty as she'd been every day this week, but I didn't care when she managed to stump me on her second question.
 I found myself subconsciously comparing Heathcliff with Brandon during English, and Mr. Whethers had to ask me a question at least twice before I realized he was talking to me.
 I hardly even blushed at the inevitable giggles.
 I made a mental note to find out from Britney if I'd caught his question on the second or third repetition, but I rather suspected I'd forget.
 In fact, when class finally got out I remembered my question, but just didn't feel like asking.
 Instead, I just wanted to get away from her and the never-ending gossip.
 I waited until she stopped to talk to one of the cheerleaders about who was dating who, and then mumbled something about the bathroom, and made a break for it.

There was only one it could be, and it was no mortal.
 _Protect your brother, and I will grant you a kingdom.
 Live as you have always lived, and I will reward you with eternity.
 Kill, as I desire you to kill, and you will find a peace unknown to the mortal realm.
 The time for questioning is over.
 Trust your god as I now trust you._
 _Love me, Harruq Tun.
 Kill for me._
 The dream shattered.
 Amid the haze of red and black, he heard the cries of battle urging him on, offering him a future he had always feared and desired.

“Then what am I supposed to do?” he screamed.
 He whirled around, his helplessness showing on every feature of his face.
 “Have faith in him,” she said.
 She pulled a strand of hair from her face as the wind blew against her.
 “I have given up everything for you, Harruq.
 Don’t you see that?
 My friends, my family, my home; they are all gone from me.
 Because of you.
 Don’t make it all for nothing.”
 Harruq’s anger and frustration simmered and swirled in a dying fire.

Kojas flicked his sword down and I saw Seth flinch.
 He looked at his arm in amazement where a deep cut had sliced through his clothes.
 He pressed his fingers on his arm to stop the blood and continued to scoot towards the sword.
 Kojas stepped to the side and blocked his path.
 Seth gazed up at him and I saw his eyes blaze in hate.
 “What do you want?” he snarled.
 “Seth, I think you know what I want.” “Never!” The faery chuckled and I saw his greasy hair bounce up and down.
 “You seriously think that I assumed you would walk away with me?
 Oh, I had no intention of it being this simple.” I knew what he meant, and I yanked my bow off.
 I pulled my arrow out and notched it, aiming it at Kojas’ back.

"Yeah.
 Doesn't Marie's tan look great?"
 "Yeah--I wish I tanned that prettily."
 As she'd promised when she'd invited them, Teri had made a Chinese meal.
 "House rules: you have to spend at least 15 minutes using chopsticks," she told them as they sat down to dinner.
 "After that, you can have a fork if you want."
 Marie had eaten in Chinese restaurants in 1927, so she managed with the chopsticks.
 The meal was enjoyable, but she couldn't keep her thoughts from wandering to Rick.
 His neck looked so warm and inviting.
 She wanted to bury her face in the crook of his neck and shoulder.

The biggest surprise came when Jordaan came to say goodbye.
 Rodregas had his stuff all spread out in the room he had been using, organizing what would go where.
 The trunk had been left in the barn back at the farm, but its contents were now in his saddlebag.
 Rodregas had signaled Jordaan to wait a moment as he rolled his gear up.
 He was wrapping some of the Grimoires that they were not reading and the small mechanical toy frog that he had picked up in Ravenhurr’s laboratory when Jordaan made a funny sound and stepped forward.
 Jordaan seemed to be staring at the package and Rodregas wondered if he had recognized one of the Grimoires.
 Jordaan pointed at the newly wrapped package and said, “Excuse me, but can I see that?” Rodregas nodded and curiously handled the half wrapped pack over to the Nymph wondering what had captured his attention.
 The Nymph slowly laid the package on the bed and unwrapped it.
 His hand passed over the contents in a motion similar to what he had done while working on Rodregas.
 To Rodregas’ surprise he stopped at the small toy frog.

Art – Then write a fiction novel about her great beauty.
 The entire purpose of the whole deed isn’t accuracy, but flattery to keep you out of the dog house.
 It won’t hurt her, and you’ll hopefully escape with your skin intact.
 Jim – That leaves a lot to look forward to.
 Art – It isn’t that bad, except for the constant being on guard so that you don’t say the wrong thing, but that soon becomes second nature.
 Jim – What happens if it doesn’t?
 Art – Like with most of the natural world, men who don’t adapt to changes don’t live for very much longer.
 Jim – How do you always do that?
 Art – Do what?
 Jim – Put the worse possible face on things, all while managing to scare me to the point that I fear for my life.

 Everyone seemed really worried last night."
 "I'm not sure.
 Not really.
 It won't be straightforward; nothing involving Brandon ever is.
 His pack is bigger, but we've always had the laws on our side before this..." Rachel broke off as my eyes got bigger.
 "Sorry, that's touching on some of the things I'm not supposed to tell you."
 I shrugged, pretending indifference.
 "How soon will we know if it's really bad or just a little bad?"
 "I don't know.

Panic attacks work like this: adrenalin kicks in when it has no business doing so.
 Because it’s so unwarranted, the fight or flight response it unleashes causes a paralyzing sort of fear, which spirals upward into what feels like the beginning of eternal torment.
 While under the spell of that malady, I came upon 1 John 4:18 in the King James version: “There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment.
 He that feareth is not made perfect in love.” I can testify that fear has torment, even that fear is torment.
 And since I suffered and recovered from panic attacks, I feel qualified to offer a remedy.
 Back then, I often read The Daily Word, which frequently repeated the message, “Let go and let God.” What we churchgoing folk might call surrender.
 Surrender is the remedy, at least for panic attacks.
 Maybe for everything.
 As I pass the turnoff to my former home in Chico, I think, surrender must make perfect sense to anyone who adores God like Brother Lawrence did.
 When we are around someone we adore, our defenses cave in, because the only thing we fear, the only thing that needs defending, is the communion with the one we adore.

Crops grew bountiful and healthy.
 A single prayer cured all sickness and disease.
 Mankind spread across the land with remarkable speed, forming two kingdoms.
 East of the Rigon River was Neldar, ruled by Karak.
 To the west was Mordan, governed by Ashhur.
 However, there was a delta at the end of the river controlled by none.
 Within were a few small villages with no government, no ruler.
 Karak brought his troops to establish order.
 Ashhur was quick to defend it, and in turn, claim it as his own.”
 “You speak of centuries ago,” Qurrah interrupted.

He'd had his house built on a beautiful acre that was located on the southeast edge of the area inhabited by Boston's elite.
 Real estate prices there were outrageous, but Rick, with his connections and eye for property, had gotten this parcel for next to nothing.
 It was only a few blocks from the downtown area and considered too close for comfort by true members of the upper class.
 But for Rick it was perfect.
 Both his office and his neighbors were close but not too close, and he had a beautiful lawn in the front and a large patio and flower garden in the back.
 Rick smiled as he walked into his kitchen, loosening his tie.
 Lauri moaned every time she walked into the garden.
 What a waste, she always sighed, looking at him with reproach.
 A woman would love having that garden, but what did a man know about flowers?
 Truthfully, he knew very little, Rick mused as he set his cartons of Chinese on the counter and went to change clothes.

Art – Last I had heard they hadn’t decided on a name.
 Yes this is Elizabeth Struan’s show, assuming that is what you’re looking for.
 Karen – Yes, that’s the one.
 Art – Well you’ve found it, feel free to fill out the critique form when you’re done, she enjoys hearing what others think of her work.
 Karen – Where are they at?
 Art – Over there by the exit, pens and all.
 The pens are free supplied by the gallery, so make sure you snag one as a souvenir.
 Karen –I might do that.
 Thank you.
 Art – (turns to leave and search for Jim) Any time for a pretty young woman.

He had no clue who this Aurelia was, but if she wanted to intervene he was glad to let her.
 “This does not concern you, elf,” said one of the guards.
 Harruq coughed at this.
 The woman saving him was an elf?
 Had the world turned upside down?
 “Oh really?” Aurelia said.
 “How sad.”
 “We said go, now, or else.”
 “Or else what?”
 The sword point left Harruq’s neck, and he assumed the guard made a threatening gesture.

** I must have checked the clock sixteen times during the last five minutes of the obligatory half-hour.
 The sensible, grownup part of me was arguing for another five minutes just to make sure, but I told that part to take a flying leap and all but ran through the house looking for Donovan.
 "Yes, mistress?
 Do you need something?"
 "Donovan, Alec said I could go watch them work out.
 Will you take me to wherever they are?"
 He dried his hands on a blisteringly white towel, and nodded.
 "Of course.
 I believe they are in the north end of the valley.
 Right this way."

She'd love to know what rumors were going to be flying about, but she knew none would be as fantastic as the truth.
 Several friends invited her to parties and dinners planned for the weekend, but she declined all of them, saying that she wanted to spend some time with her family.
 The truth was that she felt incapable of simply picking up where she'd left off.
 She loved being with her family again, and she was having a wonderful time with her mother, but it felt as if something were missing.
 And she knew Rick was that something.
 As glad as she was to be home, she felt incomplete without him.
 It was as if her whole morning had been a series of peaks and valleys.
 She and her mother would exclaim over a dress that was perfect for her, and then she'd realize that she wouldn't be able to wear it for Rick.
 She'd see an elegant necktie that would be perfect for Rick and then realize she could never give it to him.
 She'd known she'd miss him, but she'd thought that the excitement of being home would lessen that feeling.

Successful systems that improve efficiency and expand activities.
 Organizations that promote cooperation, coordination and broaden the sphere of activity.
 Environmentally friendly technologies that can be widely adopted.
 Social attitudes that foster self-confidence, individual initiative, and positive responses to new opportunities.
 Development-oriented laws, policies and programmes that can be more fully implemented.
 A huge surge in development can be achieved if every socially available resource and potential is fully utilized by the people – if every capable youth, male and female, continues education up to the level of his or her highest aptitude; if every family employs all the health care knowledge and best practices known by the society; if every government self-employment programme and training programme is fully utilized; if all known technology for improving agriculture is widely publicized and put into practice; if every successful system and institution is replicated and applied to full advantage.
 The highest priority must be to evolve strategies for utilizing these vast social resources more effectively.
 The magnitude of this potential is illustrated by the enormous gap, referred to earlier, between average yields on major food crops achieved by poor developing countries in Asia and Africa and the yields obtained by the world’s most productive producers.
 Proven technology already exists that is capable of raising low yields well above the world averages.
 The real limiting factors are inadequate dissemination of information about best practices and success stories, inadequate skills in employing these methods, inadequate organizational arrangements for marketing and processing, as well as out-moded policies and attitudes about food self-sufficiency and the role of agriculture in the national economy.

We played with Sha Na Na.
 (laughs)  We did one of our stranger things, at the Auditorium North Hall with The Nice and The Flock and Henry Cow.
 That was a weird night, because, well, we didn’t really fit it.
 This was the beginning of prog rock—sort of, it wasn’t really time, yet--and these guys, they were out there, I mean, beautiful cats, and Henry Cow had that guy--Frith—what was his name?—weird cat, and, well, they were all Moog Synths and Synclaviers and violins and even marimbas, and, hell, we were just this heavy guitar oriented trio, you know?
 It was an odd marriage that didn’t really work.
 And I think the crowd was there to see us, because, you know, who the hell were these foreigners with their off-the-wall songs and instrumentation?
 And even though a lot was tolerated back then—I mean, Jesus, everyone had to have their 15 minute drum solo—every fucking concert, every fucking group—the crowd didn’t warm to Gentle Giant—which was (is) a really tight combo, playing some farout stuff.
 I think later, they returned to Memphis and played the Coliseum in front of Tull,  and went down a lot better.
 Anyway, we started hearing this, you blew them off the stage and shit like that.
 But, you know, all that competitive stuff, that’s just for the media.

I saw Kojas’ glowing eyes and sword, the dwarf, his armies, the ghost girl, the dark woods and her haunting voice.
 It all crashed down on me, the weight of the whole situation.
 We were being hunted, I could die.
 Oh boy, this is what happen when I think things out.
 “You are cold,” he stated.
 “Don’t deny it; you’re shaking like a leaf.
 Wait I don’t like that analogy, you’re shaking like a mole rat.” “Do mole rats shake?” I asked.
 He rolled his eyes and wrapped an arm around my shoulder.
 We sat there in silence and I leaned on his shoulder.
 We both stopped shivering as we stared at the sky.

I don’t know what it will be.
 It’s something I feel so deeply, like nothing I ever felt before.
 Maybe it’ll be good.
 Maybe not.
 All I know is, everything is going to be different.
 Way different.” Karen Flagstad was a songleader.
 Her squad danced at basketball games.
 If I attended, she would wave and smile at me.
 On a Friday evening, Eric, Kenny Neidermeyer, Bill Torrey and I split a magnum of champagne on the pretense of celebrating Kenny’s parents’ divorce, which had gotten finalized that week.
 We had no other plans, so I suggested we visit the basketball game, since Karen’s wave and smile might revive my hope and cheer me.

Buddy played with Carole King, with the L.A.
 Session, with Linda Rondstadt.
 He was revered, honored (Grammy for “Song for L. Enos,” 1971), patted on his self-satisfied back.
 But it was all so vacuous.
 And, what for a Memphis musician is worse, so soulless.
 Buddy had gone to hell, many in Memphis thought, though no one said so.
 There was, for a homegrown prodigy, still respect, pride, a sort of sweetly sad valediction.
 When Buddy was buried in L.A. that was the final blow.
 His parents flew out for the interment but no one else from Memphis went.
 It is said there were many celebrities there.

“Keep your big butt safe, okay?” she said.
 The half-orc tried to answer but his mouth refused to cooperate.
 Somehow, it seemed to have become unhinged.
 Besides, it wasn’t as if he could think of anything to say.
 All his mind could concentrate on was the feel of the elf’s soft lips on his cheek, the flowery scent of her perfume mixed with sweat, and the quick brush of her breasts against his arm.
 By the time his jaw and mind began working again, Aurelia was laughing.
 “What’s so funny?” he demanded.
 The elf smiled.
 “Nothing.
 Just a big stupid half-orc I’m going to miss.

It’s Buddhist, isn’t it?
 I mean, sitting still while the winds blow.
 Winds of change, winds of creativity.
 Lorelei has taught me much, man, many things I can’t even tell you.
 You’ll get it—you’ll see where it’s all been heading.
 Anyway, Memphis, yeah, it’s still part of that—the signpost on the road.
 Memphis still burbles up through even my most contented piece of songwriting, still smolders underneath it all.
 So many musicians came through Memphis, man, came through, came from.
 Some never got any recognition, yet they fed the stream, they kept the mojo alive.
 Bluesmen who played because playing was what they did.

 Liz – I think John finally let it go.

It did not last long for as they broke their grip Imeralda said, “All right, you two are pretty tough and all, but don’t expect me to join in this crazy crusade.
 Do you know how many thousands  of wannabe heroes have died over the years trying to stop the Immortalist’s preying on the rest of us?” She seemed to shiver for a second and then took a breath and said, “I won’t join you in your crusade, but I will try to help you as I can.” Rodregas nodded and said “Fair enough,” and then reached out to her with the same grip; the grip of one equal warrior to another.
 She seemed surprised at his gesture.
 Rodregas said, “Help as you can, not as a warrior, but as you see fit, and travel this way with us for a bit.
 If nothing else it should prove interesting.” She hesitated then gripped first his arm and then Doi’van’s and she said, “Ok, let’s give that a shot.” Rodregas then made a gut decision.
 He had decided to no longer live safely but to live as he wanted to live.
 He had never been given great gifts, but that did not mean that he should not give great gifts to others.
 Doi’van’s help would be priceless; he was clearly a powerful warrior.
 Imeralda was also going to walk this path with them, and he would never get what the armor and bow were worth on the black market so… Rodregas reached down first and opened the trunk and said, “Well, if you are going to be traveling with us for a while, this won’t fit either of us guys.
 So it makes most sense for you to have it.” He started handing her the Mithril chain armor.

"Always observing the old forms, aren't you, Alec.
 Well now it's time for a whole new batch."
 One second Brandon was a human, the next he was a huge monstrosity, a thing that normally dwelt in the bottom, most primitive parts of the mind, venturing out only to star prominently in nightmares.
 The rush of power beat back at our entire pack.
 If it'd been a physical wind it would've knocked me over.
 Intangible or not, it still staggered me and only my grip on Jasmin and Dom kept me from dropping to my knees.
 Alec stood motionless for a pair of seconds, and then seemed to explode and melt back into himself.
 I blinked, and his human body had been replaced with the hybrid form that'd saved my life once before.
 Only this time he wasn't fighting wolves, he was fighting another hybrid, and Brandon towered over him.
 There was another ripple of movement on the other side of the light.

In the morning I changed and ran down stairs and left a note saying I was going out to eat with Jason, Emily and Seth.
 It took me minutes to speed down to the small breakfast restaurant in town.
 I chained up my bike and walked over to the plastic blue table my friends had occupied.
 I slid in next to Emily, who was talking about some book she had read recently.
 Jason, who sat next to her, was pretending to be fascinated by her rant.
 Emily stopped in mid-sentence when she noticed me sitting beside her.
 “Jazell, you’re here!” she exclaimed.
 “Is it true, did you take on a monster by yourself yesterday?” I sighed, shooting a look at Seth.
 “Yes it is.
 Thanks tattle-tale Seth.” “Well you did and I thought the group had a right to know that.” Seth said sharply.

We stopped under the canopy of a red oak and Steed grabbed me as I slid awkwardly from the horse.
 “You may ask him to kneel, Elfreda.” Not that he appeared to mind handling me about the waist to help me down.
 Looking up at him, I pushed the hair away from my face.
 “Yes, well, I guess I should start practicing.” Heat brushed my skin as the fire Chevelle was building flared.
 It returned to its proper size and Chevelle commanded, “Sit, Elfreda.” Steed followed as I walked to a fallen limb by the fire and settled atop the widest part, drawing my legs up from the ground.
 He sat as well, apparently not concerned about who was finding us breakfast.
 Irritation rolled off Chevelle as he ran into the thick line of trees that bordered the clearing.
 In only a moment he was back, carrying three large, white birds.
 “Where is your bow?” I asked.
 Steed’s laugh was loud.

Settling onto my usual stool, I leaned forward, elbows on the carved edge of the table to prop my head up for the monotonous hours to come.
 It was hard to say how long I sat so, looking down on a huge volume entitled The Great Elves of Varkenshire, pretending to read.
 But my eyes had wandered from the page to a small thistle where it rested among some other potion ingredients.
 It had begun to extend its leaves.
 I was startled; Junnie was preoccupied with a lengthy scroll across the room and couldn’t have possibly been the source, and I had never made anything grow.
 I concentrated on the thistle then, eyeing each tiny spike.
 I knew the magic, though it had never worked for me before.
 To my surprise, the leaves turned up and the head began to turn green.
 The stem reached out new roots and new buds began to form.
 I gasped.

“What happened?”
 Harruq sighed, and he removed his swords and flung them to the ground.
 “I can’t do it,” he said.
 “We don’t need it.
 _You_ don’t need it.
 Our war is coming, Qurrah.
 Let us fight it when it comes, but not sooner, not now, not while they sleep…”
 He looked away as if expecting to be berated for the outburst.
 Instead, Qurrah walked over and put a hand on his brother’s shoulder.
 “Be careful,” he said in his raspy voice.

Her boots splashed in the melted snow again, and I sent the icy water racing up under the material of her skirt to her bare legs.
 Shock crossed her face and I hoped it would buy the time I needed.
 What now?
 The cold water had thrown her for no more than a fraction of a second, but it was enough time to right myself and execute one quick attack.
 I volleyed a nearby rock, which struck her in the back of the head and threw her balance off for another instant.
 I knew I was larger than her so I gritted my teeth and lunged, grabbing her as I tried to figure my next move.
 She raised her face and, when her eyes met mine, they narrowed.
 Part of me was aware I should have been scared, but I was enjoying myself.
 Whatever pain I might receive didn’t factor; I had wanted to hurt this wicked little redhead since the first time I’d seen her, since her hand reached out seductively toward Chevelle and collected my ruby.
 My palms lit where they wrapped around her arms.

I was curled in Steed’s lap.
 Chevelle stormed toward us.
 The arm wrapped around my back loosened but Steed’s body didn’t seem to tense.
 His body.
 I giggled a little for no apparent reason and then tried to straighten myself so I wasn’t cuddling with him.
 Chevelle held his arm out and I wondered foggily if he intended to strike one of us, which made me laugh again.
 He shook his head, plainly disapproving, and a flagon landed in his open palm.
 He knelt in front of us.
 “Drink.” Yes, I was thirsty.
 So thirsty.

She could barely breathe but didn't want to be released.
 When he at last set her down, she continued to cling to him.

 "Do you want me to call in sick?"
 She drew back to look at him.
 "Would you do that?"
 "If you need me, sure."
 She smiled.
 "I need you.

“Big mistake, elfie,” he said.
 He snatched his swords and sheathed them.
 “I’ll make you pay for that.”
 After a bit of debate, he decided not to tell Qurrah.
 Velixar had already made it clear they needed to be careful.
 Now he understood why.
 He wouldn’t tell Aurelia, either.
 That would be stupid, and stupid he was not…‌most of the time.
 “I need a drink,” he said, turning toward the town and trudging back.
 All he could think about was getting a good, stiff drink.

This was all unchartered territory.
 It was all uncomfortable.
 It all sucked big time.
 My pride would take a back seat to Brandon’s needs.
 His drug problem was more important than the grudge I was holding over my brother’s drug-induced antics.
 I felt like I was selling out.
 But somewhere in my heart I guess I had always hoped that Thomas and I would mend the damage between us.
 That one day I could forgive.
 That one day our families would spend a holiday together, and that holiday would lead to another and eventually things would be as normal as they could be.
 Part of me also felt that my older brother was in need of a way to get back in good graces of the family and that maybe I could give this to him by reaching out.

Like The River.
 Skippy and Crafty were not even angry with Buddy, to hear them tell it today.
 Skippy works at Ardent and Crafty is a driver for UPS, but they recall those grand days with Buddy with something like ardor.
 “He was way ahead of all of us,” Skippy says.
 “His energy came from someplace else.” At any rate in early 1970, having witnessed the death of some of the gods, Buddy Gardner turned his back on Memphis, moved to L.A. with Lorelei, who then just as suddenly disappeared.
 Like a genii whose work is done.
 Some say she turned to making porno films.
 Some say she works in television.
 Some say she went back to perdition from whence she came.
 But it was in L.A. that Buddy transformed himself into a folk artist, a singer/songwriter with a heart on his sleeve and an ace up it.

 She’d wandered far from Rick’s house .
 .
 .
 but she was still in 2011.
 She took a minute to get her bearings and then wandered back toward Rick’s house.
 He was perched on the edge of a chair and sprang to his feet when he saw her.
 “Are you all right, sweetheart?” he asked, taking her hand.
 “Yes.” “I’m sorry you didn’t get home.” Tears filled her eyes.
 “I tried so hard.

“Do we ever know, Jazell?” “Good point.” *** Emily couldn't sleep.
 She kept closing her eyes but it didn't seem like a time to sleep.
 She wanted to do something, just to occupy her busy mind.
 She watched a strange creature fly over to her tree and hook itself on a branch near her.
 It looked like a butterfly with only one set of wings, which were transparent and seemed to glow.
 It had a tail and curled around the branch so it could rest its middle.
 Emily watched it and its beauty; she didn't think that something this pretty could be found in a place so dark and full of death.
 “Hello,” it said.
 Emily propped herself up on her elbow.
 “Hi, what are you?” “An augothas.” it replied and fluttered its wings.

Mr. Simms seemed especially dense, and pretty much let everyone do whatever they wanted for the entire class.
 In deference to my new dedication to academic excellence, I finished up the reading, and then opened up my Biology book and started trying to get a handle on all of the items I'd thought I understood, but apparently hadn't.
 When the bell rang I limped back to my locker before making my painful way to Physics.
 I almost turned around and left when I saw the substitute again, but almost two decades of ingrained respect for authority figures propelled me into the room and to my seat.
 I happened to look up at the exact moment that Alec appeared in the doorway.
 I expected him to take one look at the sub and turn around like he'd done before, but he registered the presence of a substitute and then came inside regardless.
 It didn't make sense until the first girl all but fainted as he walked past her desk.
 Of course.
 He didn't like substitutes, and figured he had better places to be, but the draw of hero worship after having almost double-teamed Vincent was just too much to resist.
 The sub took a desultory roll, and then waved his hands at us.

Britney stopped before one of the top lockers and started spinning the tumbler.
 She was still relating some story about her old school, but suddenly I couldn't hear a word.
 The crowd of students had drifted to the sides of the hall, like worshipers making way for a pair of pagan gods.
 Even so, there still wasn't quite room for them to walk side by side.
 The girl was leading.
 Her dark, wavy hair and flawless skin would've made her pretty in any crowd, but she also had perfectly symmetrical features and one of those bodies that required hours each day in the gym to maintain.
 I wanted to hate her.
 It didn't make any sense, she could hardly be blamed for taking care of herself, but it just didn't seem fair.
 Simply by being in the same town as us, she automatically made every other girl in school feel like bloated, heifers.
 Surely she was somehow cheating to be doing so well in the subtle, nasty game in which every high-school girl ranked herself against every other female.

What was.
 The album smokes.
 It tears down ceiling tiles.
 It disrupts fish in their blue aquarium lives.
 It calls like a squonk in the wee hours, in the time between sleep and dawn.
 It disrupts phone lines, calls old girlfriends and makes them want you again.
 It stirs mud and makes bouillabaisse.
 Black Lung fashioned alchemy, friends, at least once, in that small studio, over a period of 72 straight hours without sleep, so the story goes.
 They laid down 43 minutes of catalytic reverb love.
 Some of you understand.

Brandon's voice had been like silk caressing my face when I'd answered the phone.
 One minute I was minding my own business trying to pretend like I didn't notice the nasty looks some of Brandon's friends were shooting my way when they thought I wasn't looking, the next I was going to the biggest dance of the year with the most popular guy in school.
 I'd half thought Cassie was going to rip out my throat.
 I walked past a pair of gorgeous, gold-fringed drapes, handed my ticket to a distinguished-looking man in a uniform, and then smiled as he pointed me towards my door.
 It was almost a relief to be around strangers again.
 He'd been polite, but hadn't tried to fawn over me.
 My being asked out had changed my treatment from almost every girl at school.
 Half the student body, the more sensible portion it seemed, had all decided that I was some kind of massively stuck-up slut.
 The other half had decided they needed to be my new best friend if they wanted to get invited to any of the cool parties ever again.
 It might not have bothered me except the girls who now hated me were the ones I generally would've gotten along with, at least as much as I ever got along with anyone.

Seth smiled at me.
 “Well, yes but you have green hair.
 It’s bright green, like neon green.” I shoved my hair in front of my face.
 It was bright green all right.
 I stood up and examined myself.
 I was wearing light brown hunting boots and tight black pants made out of some sort of light cloth.
 A thick woven jacket was shielding me from the October cold.
 When I looked back at Seth, I realized he had also made an outfit change.
 He was wearing black leather boots and dark blue pants.
 His top was a short, brown cloak with a hood and leather belt.

There were all kinds of theories about how to travel through time, but there was absolutely nothing that could explain how she’d traveled through time.
 She hadn’t gotten in a time machine, hadn’t been near a dead star, hadn’t been thinking about 2011.
 That was another thing—most of the articles talked about traveling back in time, not forward.
 How could she have been thinking about 2011 when she knew nothing about it?
 She picked up a book with a chapter on traveling through time by thought.
 Like most of the others, it was about traveling backwards, so it couldn’t explain how she got here, but now she was trying to travel backwards.
 It said you should surround yourself with objects from the period you wanted to go to and eliminate any evidence of the present and then think about a scene from the period.
 That was pretty much what she’d been doing .

I don’t know, it’s not one of my favorites now, even though it’s newish.
 I wrote it one night—I think Lor and I had had a fight,  a rare fight, and she had gone to a girlfriend’s house and I just thought, fuck it, I’m gonna do speed and stay up all night.
 I didn’t plan on writing.
 I thought, I’ll just speed and watch late night TV—there was some John Agar movie on—You dig John Agar?
 No?
 Don’t know him?
 Anyway, I was sitting there and there was a legal pad on the coffee table because earlier in the day I had tried writing a song about my mother—don’t ask—and it was sitting there like an invitation and I was speeding like a hell-rooster, man, and I just picked up the pad and this big fat marker, I mean I was writing these huge thick letters on the  page (laughs) and I just started, “You were mean to me/Leave me alone, let me sit in my tree/You were a snake, I needed you then/you were like bad heroin.”  And I ripped the whole thing off in about an hour.
 And I recorded it that night in my living room, fingers tearing over my strings till they bled, I was playing so hard, like Richie, and that song, that was recorded in my home—it sounds like it.
 But it was born of anger, and so, well, it’s not one of my faves.
 Lor came back about dawn and I was still up and I was crying, just sitting there crying with the guitar in my lap, and she put her arms around me, and that’s the story of that song.

I showed up at practice early and whispered the words in case something went wrong and he heard.
 I can’t imagine what my punishment would have been, though it might have been worth it.
 He fell asleep quickly and I ran as fast as I could, my pulse pounding with excitement.
 I spent the entire day away from the castle.
 Without the drain of practice, I was thrilling with energy.
 I could feel the trees, the mountain.
 I hope Father never comes back!
 I am sure I will try again tomorrow and every day I can spare after that.
 ~ Rune was completely unaware of any foul play yesterday, so I had full confidence in the spell this morning.
 Not that I wouldn’t have attempted it again anyway, but at least I know I’m safer now.

He looked around and to his alarm he saw the last remaining squire running toward the hall with the shield.
 It was generally understood that you did not try to claim the shield until the last opponent was down.
 But, of course, the winner was simply the first to take the shield to the hall.
 Rodregas jumped up and ran, his arms pumping.
 He was almost as surprised as the armored squire with how fast he caught him and knocked him to the ground.
 This squire, though, thrust the shield at him and collapsed to the ground.
 Rodregas looked around the arena to make sure no one was left to fight and then headed into the great hall, carrying the shield of the tournament champion.
 As he walked the hallway into the main hearing chamber, knights stood along the walls.
 As Rodregas passed they all mumbled the same words to him, “Welcome to the Order my brother.” Several reached out and shook his hand or showed other signs of welcome.
 Others, though, looked at him strangely, clearly put off by the way he had won the melee.

And she could sing, Big Mama Thornton kind of voice out of this little wispy Southern gal.
 She sang, “Ball and Chain” just like Janis.
 And, they had an original, called “What Passes Here for Heaven.”  They were alright.

I looked around, baffled.
 The makeshift audience wore easy, amused smiles.
 They watched me, not the vacant space from which Grey had evidently disappeared.
 And then I noticed someone beside me who hadn’t been there before… it was him.
 “How…” But he was gone again.
 I’d been staring right at him and had no idea where he’d gone.
 I was just beginning to doubt whether I’d seen him at all when I spotted him standing across the circle, grinning fiendishly while he dangled an object from his hands.
 It was the feather Ruby had tied in my hair.
 I’d forgotten about it.
 I reached up to feel for it and it was gone.

Mallory suddenly doubled over in a fit of coughing that left her white and shaking.
 I jumped to my feet and almost ran for Alec, but she grabbed my hand with more of that fragile strength, and pulled me back down.
 "There isn't anything he can do for me, child, and unless I'm very much mistaken he's more than normally worried right now.
 He's in no kind of way needing yet more to fret about.
 Just let me catch my breath and I'll be as right as ever."
 Several minutes later, once the renewed bout of coughing had subsided, Mallory looked back up at me with wan features.
 "How did it happen?
 What brought things between Brandon and our Alec to a head?"
 "It was my fault.
 I'd been dating Brandon, and we went to a party.

I'd always managed to pull A's or at least A-'s, but hated all of the little nitpicky rules.
 Unfortunately, after missing a whole month of classes, I was at least as bad off in Algebra as I was in Biology.
 Mrs. Campbell was solving problems with so many variables in them it was like watching alphabet soup spontaneously re-arrange itself on her overhead projector.
 Not only that, things were being squared and cubed, an operation with which I had only passing familiarity.
 I struggled valiantly to understand what was going on.
 I got the sense the operations being applied to the formulas were being explained very well, I just didn't have the vocabulary to follow what she was saying.
 By the time class finally ended I was fighting not to become emotional.
 The fact that Britney looked for a moment like she was debating whether or not to wait for me before finally stopping next to the door with her arms crossed, didn't help.
 I threw my book and binder into my backpack and tromped up to the front of the classroom.
 Mrs. Campbell looked up when I reached her desk.

Their faces disappeared as I was swallowed by the trees.
 I skidded to a halt and scanned the trees.
 I didn’t see any trace of where Seth could have ran.
 That shows how much I know about asking questions.
 I don’t get the answers and boom; I lose it and become a demanding person.
 I walked more slowly, watching the trees.
 I sent a silent prayer that Seth hadn’t entered Igneeria, because then I would never find him.
 What bugged me the most was that Seth didn’t fight me when I pushed him down.
 He just sat on the ground not saying anything at all in his own defense.
 Now, I couldn’t find him anywhere and I would never get my answer.

This Thanksgiving we had an agenda that didn’t include turkey and all the trimmings.
 Agenda Item One: Get our son’s belongings out of his rental house.
 The landlord met me, Lisa, Harry, Harry’s wife Anabel, and a shaking miserable Brandon at the house, and I felt sorry for the owner of this home.
 He was a deeply religious man accompanied by his mousy wife and perfectly groomed daughter, all dressed in their Sunday best on their way home from church.
 He had believed all of Brandon’s lies, trusted my son and his roommates and ended up landlord of a drug den.
 He was devastated to see the condition of his property but he was strangely calm and understanding.
 He simply wanted our help to get Brandon’s belongings out of his house and fix things as best we could.
 He gave us an offer we couldn’t refuse.
 If we would get everything out by the evening and pull out all of the carpet, he would not pursue damages.
 None of us were prepared for what we saw when we turned the key in the lock and opened the door.

One stopped and raised its head up towards me.
 It opened its mouth to reveal rows of sharp, yellow fangs.
 A chuckle escaped its mouth.
 “What are you going to do with that, half-ling?” it said with a voice that sent needles into my skin.
 “A knife won't do a thing against something like me.” I almost listened to the thing and started to lower my weapon but I caught myself.
 My hands started to shake.
 Its eyes glistened with hunger.
 “You can't even hold a weapon.
 So how are you going to save your friends?” I didn't know what it was talking about until I looked over.
 Seth was stiff and frozen, his eyes following one of the snake creatures that was climbing its way up his leg.

They laughed and sat in a tight circle mumbling things I didn’t catch.
 My hand slipped to my knife but Emily grabbed my hand to keep me from drawing it from its leather case.
 “No Jazell not yet, maybe we can learn a little more from them.” Her voice was a hoarse whisper.
 “But Emily, it’s awful to listen to.
 Can’t we just destroy the camp?” I went for my bow instead.
 “No,” she said a little more clearly.
 “We have to wait and see what happens.
 Plus, we can’t just randomly attack them.” I didn’t really care.
 The song was repeating itself in my head, like a taunt.
 Without thinking, I aimed and shot the nearest dwarf.

With a shrug she added, “But I do not think it will help much on the battlefield.” Rodregas nodded.
 It might have little practical effect, but he knew that while a greater sigil might make him a great fighter and that while fighting was necessary, it had no real inherent value.
 It simply made one better at fighting.
 Somehow he knew the blessing was inherently a positive thing.
 He remembered on hot sunny days as a kid the wonderful pleasure of lying under a tree when the city would be so hot in the summer, but in the shade of the tree it was just perfect.
 It was a random thought, but a good one.
 Doi’van interrupted his memory by asking a question.
 So like Doi’van, always thinking, Rodregas thought with a smile.
 “So first I make my infernal side more structured and then I become a part Nymph, a strange combination for a Hellborn.” Rodregas said, “I think we both feel the importance of the blessing and I thank you for sharing it.” She nodded and said, “I am so happy that I decided to go with you to sneak in, otherwise I would never have been able to receive the blessing of the One Tree.
 No matter how successful we are now against the Immortalists, I have been blessed as few of my people have.” Imeralda looked like she wanted to talk and Rodregas hated to break the mood, but they needed to get back to business.

Just another day at the office, I guess.
 In a moment, my crack-berry starts to blow up with one call after the next from Ashley, wanting to know when we are doing this deal.
 I must keep buying time with excuses, now nearing a two-hour delay waiting for the cops to come from the other bust.
 It is looking like this deal is not going to happen either.
 I answer some of the calls and ignore others as I am instructed to do by Officer White.
 I whisper in one call as if I can’t talk because I am still stuck at home with my wife and cannot talk freely.
 I reassure Ashley that I will meet her as soon as I can get out.
 I think of my wife and son at home wondering why I haven’t called; is it over?
 Am I dead?
 Finally the crew is all present behind the store, and the review of protocol and procedure began as it did before.

And, even if we never performed any of it, which we didn’t, they were my songs, and they were popping up on the radio.
 Sebastian did, “Lemmy Caution’s Incubus,” and I think that was really the start of it.
 That was big for him—he has that voice, you know, like he’s sitting next to you, and it perfectly fit the song.
 God bless him—no slouch at writing songs himself, he really took me under his wing, sort of.
 Not much has been made of that connection, but John, early on, taught me the logistics of writing for money, of getting my stuff with one of the music publishers.
 A lot of artists did this, you know, kind of like what Dylan was doing with The Basement Tapes, except that took on a whole life of its own, because it was Bob.
 So, I did some demos, at Ardent with Jim’s help, and others, I just wrote, you know, just committed them to paper and John helped me get them disseminated.
 It worked well then to do that.
 I don’t know if it still does.
 Probably, though I don’t do that anymore.

 Yeah, there.
 Tommy and Lennon and I, I don’t remember, someone had some sugar cubes.
 It might have been Donovan.
 Was he there?
 I can’t remember.
 (laughs)  Yeah, I did drugs.
 Ok, I wrote “Burn my Bridges” on speed, which is an angry drug, and it’s such an angry song.
 I don’t know, it’s not one of my favorites now, even though it’s newish.
 I wrote it one night—I think Lor and I had had a fight,  a rare fight, and she had gone to a girlfriend’s house and I just thought, fuck it, I’m gonna do speed and stay up all night.

New theory is needed that focuses on the dynamic role of information, attitudes, social institutions and cultural values in the development process.
 An international effort should be initiated at the forthcoming UN Social Summit to evolve a comprehensive, human-centred theory of individual and social development that will lead to the formulation of more effective strategies to accelerate the development process.
 UNDP's approach to human security and sustainable development is an important contribution to this effort.
 3.Social organization index: It is now widely recognized that a country's social organization or 'social capital' is a key determinant of its development.
 Measures and indices such as UNDP's Human Development Index that provide a comparative national assessment of progress on key dimensions of development generate greater awareness and stimulate greater political will and social initiative to improve performance.
 In a similar manner, UNDP should commission a programme to construct a Social Organization or Social Capital Index consisting of one or more scales to measure the organizational development of countries covering major sectors such as commerce, industry, agriculture, education, health care, and technical training.
 The index should evaluate the level of social organization in terms of its overall support to activities in each of these fields as well as the number and quality of institutions providing this support.
 Where objective measures are not possible, a rank or relative scale will suffice.
 These scales can then be utilized by countries to assess their own level of organizational development and to identify key areas where improvement is most needed.
 4.Scale of Productive -Skills: UNESCO should commission studies to construct a series of scales to measure the level of key skills in societies at different stages of development.

He was still holding his hand out to me.
 My back pressed against the wall, and as he took a step forward I became wholly aware of how small and isolated the library space I had chosen was.
 He turned the outstretched hand palm up, indicating the stool beside me, as if that had been his intention all along.
 “May I?” I nodded once and he slid onto the stool, facing me, not the table spread with documents.
 Have I still not spoken?
 His eyes moved down to the pendant against my chest and then quickly back to my face, as if he had committed an indiscretion.
 We sat there for a few more moments, but my words would not return, not with this imposing stranger inches before me.
 When he finally spoke again, I realized his offer of help wasn’t a request.
 “Let’s begin with histories.” He flicked the middle finger of his left hand and a thick ivory tome flew from a shelf, opened, and steadied between us as if on a table.
 There was something so wrong about it, but I couldn’t say why.

And even though a lot was tolerated back then—I mean, Jesus, everyone had to have their 15 minute drum solo—every fucking concert, every fucking group—the crowd didn’t warm to Gentle Giant—which was (is) a really tight combo, playing some farout stuff.
 I think later, they returned to Memphis and played the Coliseum in front of Tull,  and went down a lot better.
 Anyway, we started hearing this, you blew them off the stage and shit like that.
 But, you know, all that competitive stuff, that’s just for the media.
 The groups don’t do that shit.
 You know, you don’t go out on stage and say, I’m gonna make their guitarist look silly.
 There’s a lot more fellow-feeling among musicians.
 So, Christ, what was my point?
 We were playing these gigs, getting bigger, getting a rep.
 This was the end of the sixties.

The fire in his veins sputtered.
 “Why so surprised?” he asked Aurelia, shame draining the thrill of his kill.
 “How could you?” she asked him.
 “What harm have we done to you?”
 Harruq shrugged.
 “You think you know me, but you don’t.
 I kill, Aurry.
 It’s what I do.
 It’s what I do best.” He drew out his swords, still dripping with blood.
 “Perhaps you didn’t believe it, but this is me.”

“I’ll see you tomorrow,” she said, taking a hesitant step toward the trees.
 “Sure thing,” Harruq said, rubbing the tear off his cheek and pretending it had not been there.
 Aurelia smiled.
 Tears were on her cheeks as well, but she left them alone.
 “Bye-bye, Harruq.”
 “Bye-bye, Aurelia.”
 Then she was gone.
 He stood there, not moving, his mind a chaos of fear, swords, Velixar, his brother, and that lingering kiss.
 Then he screamed to the sky, one long, primal roar of hopeless confusion.
 He stormed back to Qurrah, his chest a boiling pot of rage.

Llamas are furry and they spit at you when they’re mad.
 They’re the joke of most middle school kids, they’re tall…I think.
 You can see them at parks or zoos.
 They tend to try to steal your dad’s hat at the zoo.
 They can be black, brown, and white.
 I don’t think there are pink or purple or green llamas out there unless you dye them.
 I saw a llama once when I was, six at the zoo, and it stole Dad’s hat.
 They had to send a park ranger to get it back because Dad really liked that hat… A bone-shaking bang scattered my thoughts.
 Pain shot through my side.
 We rolled over and I fell on top of Seth and then we both landed on Jason.

“Cathy took me/out of the cold/Cathy took me/she was so bold.”  (laughs)  Shit.
 Ok, it was awful, but what other tribute could I give to such a fine gift?
 I wonder where she is now.
 Probably married some tax accountant or corporate lawyer.
 She was our class valedictorian in high school.
 When she gave her speech I wanted to stand up and say, “I love her.
 She gave me my first head.”  (laughs)  And I was voted, of course, “most talented.”  But, I’ve skipped ahead.
 We should spend more time in high school, if you know what I mean.
 It’s when I cut my teeth, honed my personality, became, for better or worse, what I became.

The final disaster with Richard followed a family vacation.
 Richard invited himself to join our annual family beach vacation and I allowed it.
 Richard was to watch the kids, including my two boys and his boy and girl from a subsequent marriage, one night.
 They were all in about the same nine to twelve age range.
 My wife and I wanted to have a dinner alone and Richard didn’t seem to mind.
 When we returned from dinner we discovered that he drove all of the children in his car while he drank Vodka straight from a bottle.
 Once back at the beach house, he was drunk and he verbally abused my children to the point of terror, I was done.
 I will never see him again.
 I believe being a “Father” and a “sperm donor” are not at all one in the same.
 The years of my early fatherhood brought more lessons and experiences than I can share.

But development is not only a set of goals or material achievements – it is a social process by which human beings progressively develop their capacities and release their energies for higher levels of material achievement, social and cultural advancement, and psychological fulfilment.

 An international effort should be initiated at the forthcoming UN Social Summit to evolve a comprehensive, human-centred theory of individual and social development that will lead to the formulation of more effective strategies to accelerate the development process.

Together with Russia and Brazil, they could account for a larger portion of world GDP than today’s six largest industrialized nations.
 Population, which was perceived as a liability not long ago, now appears to be an asset.
 In reality, population, like nuclear energy and so many other things, is neutral.
 Its value depends on what we human beings make of it.
 Changing Demographic Profile of the West: Demographic studies indicate that steep declines in the growth of population in Europe, Japan and USA will create acute labour shortages and unprecedented long-term demand for migration of foreign workers or transplantation of work to developing countries.
 UN and other studies estimate that Europe would have to accept 150 million new immigrants over the next 25 years in order to maintain the present levels of working population and Japan would need to admit 600,000 immigrants annually for the next 50 years in order to maintain the size of its working population at the 1995 level.
 The US labour force is projected to stop growing by 2013.
 These findings support the view of the India Vision 2020 report that “This trend will further accelerate the outsourcing of production of goods and services to locations where infrastructure, ease of doing business, quality, costs and availability of labour are most attractive, which will be beneficial for many labour surplus countries like India.”
 Expanding World Trade: Trade is playing an increasing role in the economic growth of developing countries.
 Economic integration with the global economy has become a compelling necessity for every country.

"I-I'll go sit on the patio and wait for you."
 "That's OK.
 I'm obviously not going to get there today."
 He walked silently at her side.
 When they were back inside, she didn't go upstairs to change.
 Instead, she went to the living room and sat in a corner of the sofa, erecting an invisible wall between them.
 Bewildered and a little hurt, he sat down on the opposite end and turned on the TV.
 After a few minutes of channel surfing, he pressed the mute button.
 "What's wrong, sweetheart?"
 he asked, turning toward Marie.

 Shit.

 Just out of respect for my first love, you know, and the first heart I broke.
 I broke her heart.
 And with Birdie I lost my virginity.
 On her parents’ bed, in the afternoon, with the door locked and people milling about outside.

He quickly reached out to the woman and pulled off her gag, as even that would count as a binding and would interfere with the ritual.
 He wanted to whisper to her as he removed it, and give her a hint of the desperate gambit that he was about to try, but he knew that it was not worth the risk of others overhearing.
 Both of their lives depended on her doing what Rodregas had told her.
 If he succeeded, she would know what Rodregas had done; if he failed, well he was familiar enough with that feeling.
 He saw her lips forming something under her breath, probably a spell, but she did not have time to execute a spell of sufficient strength in the time left her.
 Magic took too long to prepare to be useful so quickly.
 Ravenhurr stepped into the last circle; the one made entirely of what appeared to be fresh blood and of symbols made from the careful placement of living organs.
 Rodregas breathed in deeply, trying to settle himself, and almost gagged from the smells: the stench of fresh blood, the scent of fear from the prisoners, the smell of power, and other smells that he could not identify.
 Rodregas closed down on himself, “Duty,” he thought.
 “My real duty this time, focus on the next step.

 Take you’re friend Jim for example, I doubt its even crossed his mind that you have any romantic interest in him what-so-ever.
 He is blissfully un-aware that you have been mooning over him for the last ten years of your lives, though I think you could have made a better choice.
 Liz – Mother, we’ve been over this before…
 Cleo – Yes, yes, I know you’re sticking with Jim, and hoping that one day he’ll see the light.
 Well Elizabeth it will never happen.
 Liz – We’ve been over this too mother, he’s not gay, just because he didn’t accept your…
 Cleo – And you’re not listening to me dear.
 Jim being a man, and inherently flawed for being so, is never going to realize that you love him.
 The only way that he might get it is if you let him know strait out how you feel.

It is declining but remains 10 per cent higher than the average for 1985-94 in Germany, which is still recovering from the economic impact of reunification.
 The new market economies of Eastern Europe are growing rapidly.
 But these positive trends are no grounds for complacency.
 While they may dispel fears of an irreversible shrinkage of the job market in OECD countries, the proportion of long term unemployed remains at an unacceptably high 29 per cent of the total, indicating that these countries have not yet evolved successful strategies to address the issue.
 Left to itself, unemployment may continue to deprive large numbers of people in these countries from enjoying basic economic rights, unless concerted steps are taken to remove the perceptual and structural barriers to full employment.
 While data on unemployment levels in most developing countries is of doubtful accuracy and recent data are difficult to obtain, there is no question that the problem remains severe, especially among youth and the educated.
 ILO estimated that at the end of 2000 approximately 110 million workers in developing countries, excluding Central and Eastern Europe, were unemployed, most of them first-time jobseekers.
 Unemployment rates among young workers are almost everywhere at least twice as high as the average.
 In addition another 500 million workers in the developing world earned less than a dollar a day.
 Although the growth rate of the world's labour force is slowing down, approximately 460 million additional jobseekers will enter the global labour force between 2000 and 2010, two-thirds in Asia.

Wait until lunch."
 I wasn't entirely satisfied, but nodded, and followed her to algebra.
 Mrs. Campbell shot us both a glance that didn't bode well for any attempt to get out of class without a stern reprimand, but allowed us to go to our respective seats without comment.
 I pulled out the two assignments I'd done the night before, and passed them up with everyone else's homework.
 Realizing the lecture wouldn't do me any good, I pulled out my book, and started reading the next section in my self-appointed study regimen.
 Mrs. Campbell either understood what I was trying to accomplish, or was saving up all her venom for after class.
 She didn't call on me even once.
 Britney wasn't so lucky, and I caught a nasty look from her each time I surfaced from my textbook.
 The glares angered me more than I'd expected.
 I was having to catch up on a month's worth of assignments; she didn't have any right to get pissy just because she wasn't prepared.

For just a brief moment there were two daemon dragons.
 Then one of them fell toward the ground only to sink into the shape of Doi’van.
 Doi’van staggered and Rodregas reached out and caught him to keep him from falling.
 Apparently, being a three headed daemon dragon did not include a cat-like ability to land from a fall.
 Rodregas steadied him and then Doi’van shook himself and looked around, confused.
 “Are you all right?” Rodregas asked.
 Doi’van nodded and then said, “Let’s get out of the chamber.” Rodregas nodded, as he wanted to check on Imeralda.
 Doi’van seemed to have his balance back.
 Rodregas wondered if Doi’van had lost his balance because he had been trying to fly instead of walk.
 As they stepped out of the room of Infernal sigils and carefully closed the door behind them, Doi‘van still seemed unsteady and Rodregas wondered if his own experiences had prepared him more naturally for this.

I told her I had a brief window of time and I needed to pick up some items for my wife at the store so that was the only place and the only way I could meet them.
 She agreed and said she would see me soon.
 After I hung up the phone, the officer called me on my personal cell phone, which I was answering from a headset in my ear.
 He offered some encouraging words about how I had handled her attempt to move me and said they would try to move me again because Steve was not going to want to meet me in this county because of his arrangement with the police here.
 We were only a mile from another county line so Officer White and his team felt he would try to get me to move that mile.
 I hung up and the wait began.
 I was all eyes and all ears as the silence in the truck made it too easy for my mind to wander.
 I wasn’t allowed any background noise.
 I was parked at the far end of the lot with the front end of my truck against a fence as I was instructed to do.
 I was impatiently waiting when I finally saw one of the scraggly dressed officers wandered by pushing a grocery basket full of bags looking like a homeless person.

He could not see anyone, but he knew there would be at least two guards left: one at the gate and one in the watchtower over the gate.
 In front of the stable was a large bony horse, dappled in brown and white.
 Rodregas thought her name was Tory or Torin, he could not remember which.
 She was an older horse, in her early twenties, and was known for her mild manor.
 She was saddled and ready to go, evidently she was Korin’s planned mount.
 Rodregas took a deep breath and calmly walked out of the keep and over to the stables.
 It was not large, ordinarily holding only about a dozen horses.
 He looked around to find that it was emptied out, except for the two carriage horses.
 They must have been left in case Ravenhurr wished to travel, which would be unlikely with all his guards and servants scattered over the town, but good servants did not take their master’s transport from him.
 In the open central area, he saw both the small carriage and the supply wagon that Ravenhurr used for traveling and carry supplies back and forth to the keep.

Brandon struggled and was barely making it through high school, so we changed him to a problem-child school to enable him to graduate.
 He and his younger brother Bryce were growing apart just as I had grown apart from my brother Thomas, which was torturous for me and Lisa to watch.
 Brandon dressed like some punk and believed he was the smartest person in the room.
 He became a very obnoxious person.
 At some point, we knew he was back into drugs, we just hoped he wasn’t getting himself addicted.
 We were kidding ourselves; we felt so powerless.
 He was gaunt, broken out, nervous and angry, telling random stories that always involved the biggest-fastest-shortest-longest-cue-the-orchestra-everybody fucking him over.
 He’d always have to go save someone in some dramatic fashion.
 The things that would come out of his mouth were completely unbelievable lies and his ignorance was evident to all.
 As a parent, I was humiliated when Brandon spoke.

The music picked up slightly, and Jasmin and Alec sped up with it.
 They were moving so quickly now it almost seemed they were better than Isaac and Jessica.
 A quick visual search laid that question to rest though.
 I could just make out Isaac's towering form across the pavilion in the corner where they'd apparently gone to find room for some of their more impressive moves.
 It seemed amazing to me that they were willing to move so quickly around normal, uninformed humans, but apparently they figured professional dancers were at least as quick.
 I shook my head and turned back to Rachel, only to feel my throat constrict as I saw Britney.
 Not only was she wearing a tight, black dress that made her look at least twice as hot as me, she also happened to be draped across Brandon's arm.
 I was so caught up watching Britney that it took me several seconds to notice the differences in her date.
 Brandon had always exuded a sense of confidence, but sometime since I'd last seen him, it had morphed into something even more aggressive.
 He still cut through crowds, but people weren't moving out of his way out of deference anymore.

I opened my mouth to agree with her, but stopped before the words could fully form.
 I didn't know much, but fraud wasn't the kind of thing you associated with a slap on the wrist.
 If the worst happened and Mom was going to serve jail time then we had bigger problems than even what she was admitting to.
 ** It looked like the sun must have set hours ago, but it wasn't really dark.
 The full moon seemed oddly brighter than normal, edging the landscape with a silvery tracing.
 The cool illumination was strangely complemented by the warm tendrils of light trying to escape from the greenery surrounding the area.
 I let my gaze drop, and found an unearthly pool of liquid light at my feet.
 The quiet murmur of falling water to my right kindled a burning thirst I hadn't realized I'd been feeling since I opened my eyes.
 Looking towards the waterfall, I found a shimmering ribbon of light working its way down the rock face.
 The sight was so incredibly beautiful it took me several moments to realize the tendril was the waterfall I'd been looking for.

Flesh tore, but no blood surfaced.
 “She took all who were good out of the abyss and gave their care to Ashhur.
 Left with nothing but thieves and murderers, Karak had no choice but to make it eternal.
 The abyss is dark, Qurrah, and there is fire, but there is also order.”
 “What do you wish of me?” Qurrah asked.
 Velixar’s face softened into a dark smile.
 “To fight the war.
 Celestia may have condemned it to continue forever, but she slumbers now.
 Harnessing enough power, we can defeat the goddess.
 We can bring all of Dezrel under our control and declare victory for Karak.”

Its report presented evidence to dispel the twin myths that technological development and trade were net job destroyers.
 It traced the growth of employment opportunities through the 20th Century, a century of unprecedented technological development and commercial expansion, to show that this period has also been an era of unprecedented growth in the quantity and quality of employment opportunities.
 The report argued that the current surge in joblessness was a temporary result of the mismatch between the rates of surging population growth and expanding economic activity.
 It concurred that rising levels of unemployment constituted a serious problem that needed to be urgently addressed, but rejected the notion that it is an inevitable and incurable disease which the world must resign itself to passively suffer and endure.
 The Commission, therefore, developed and presented a comprehensive strategy for job-led economic growth.
 Over the past decade, changes in the employment picture lend credence to ICPF’s perspective.
 The American economy experienced a decade-long expansion, fuelling high levels of employment at home, while stimulating job growth throughout East Asia, attracting a massive influx of foreign technical workers and setting the stage for a global outsourcing boom which is still in its infancy.
 Among the advanced economies, unemployment declined from an average of 6.9 per cent in the period 1985-94 to 6.5 per cent during the last 10 years.
 It fell by 10 per cent in France, 25 per cent in Italy, a third in Netherlands, 50 per cent in Spain and 70 per cent in Ireland.
 It is declining but remains 10 per cent higher than the average for 1985-94 in Germany, which is still recovering from the economic impact of reunification.

It isn’t easy to forget the dark places in your past but you can either learn from them and become a better person or repeat the same behavior and have it slowly destroy you.
 I make many mistakes as a father, but I have always tried the best I know how.
 Sometimes no matter what a person does as a parent, children may travel to dangerous places.
 Some will return from those places unharmed and some may never return.
 A family can look perfect from the outside but be quite the opposite on the inside.
 I have lived such a life.
 I do not know what made me do what I did for my son but I can only surmise that it was a combination of all of the defining moments in my life that lead me to where I am today.
 The beginning .

Is there a library in the house perhaps?"
 Donovan's smile had a surprising touch of mischief to it.
 "Actually, you could say that we have two.
 In a manner of speaking."
 I felt a more genuine smile working its way across my face.
 "Could we go to one of them?
 I really should be doing my homework, but I'd much rather just curl up with a good book."
 Donovan picked up the cell phone that I, unsure whether or not it was really mine, had left on the bed, and handed it to me.
 "I believe you'll want to keep this with you at all times.
 Otherwise it won't be able to fulfill its assigned purpose.

Her throat was suddenly sore.
 "I-I think you have some lint on your back."
 She embraced him, whispering, "Thank you for everything.
 I'll miss you too."
 She gave him a smile before turning and walking into the garden.
 When she found herself at the edge of it, she veered right, seeing that it extended farther in that direction.
 She deliberately tried to lose herself, since that was how she'd gotten to 2011.
 And she knew that Rick would find her if she didn't get back to 1927.
 It wasn't working.
 She could tell--there wasn't enough fog to hide anything, and she could see that nothing had changed.

“Maybe we should see what your strong suit is,” she said and motioned me to follow her as she walked to the rock ridge and jumped over, hurrying down to the men.
 “Sorry to interrupt, gentlemen,” she announced.
 “I was wondering if you’d mind a little demonstration?” They broke their circle to give her their attention.
 “Frey here hasn’t found her rhythm yet,” she explained.
 They seemed to understand and she bounded back over to me and drew me to sit beside her on a large rock facing the men before cueing them to begin.
 The largest stepped forward, boasting deep brown hair and eyes.
 He wore plain clothing but his broad shoulders and massive size made him seem regal.
 “They name me Anvil but I am Reed, of Keithar Peak.” His voice was thick, though it was impossible to tell whether it was an accent or he had difficulty speaking.
 He was huge, frighteningly so, but something about him drew me in.
 I wanted to be his friend for no reason I could rationalize.

Eugene – it’s a conspiracy against me.
 Besides wearing camouflage doesn’t make you invisible like I thought, it just makes you a little harder to pick out when you’re in the forest.
 Art – No, no boy.
 I mean, why do you want to be adopted?
 You’re already a member of the family as is, the adopting process is just a formality.
 Eugene – I can’t explain it.
 I just don’t want to be related to Jerry anymore.
 I want him out of my life for good.
 This is the best way I can think of.
 Art – You’ll always be related to Jerry, he’s your father.

So, why would Buddy turn his back on the band after that triumph?
 There are as many theories as theorists.
 Buddy wanted success, bigger success.
 He tasted perfection with Turntable Poison but it was local perfection.
 The album, though notorious today, an insider’s treasure trove, a collector’s grail, did not sell outside of Memphis.
 No major label bought the rights to it.
 Still, even this late, one wishes, with the advent of the compact disc revolution, that it would be reissued.
 But now, Buddy wanted to be Hendrix, Clapton, Erik Brann, Zappa.
 That he settled for being Livingston Taylor is the story’s twist, what gives it verisimilitude.
 Life is unpredictable, like a chemistry experiment.

“Frey.” “Yes.” It was all I could manage.
 His eyes held mine and I could swear he was searching for something.
 He opened his mouth to speak, but the door of the wardrobe flew open.
 “Oh.” Ruby giggled the tiniest bit.
 “Excuse me.
 I didn’t mean to interrupt.” She seemed pleased she had.
 Chevelle’s hand dropped and I could see out of the corner of my eye his face was hard.
 Ruby continued, “Steed said you had a guest so I just used the back…” She trailed off when his stare didn’t soften, but she smiled.
 “You know, you do have your own room.” He stiffened and stood, not at all amused by her implication.
 Ruby began gathering things as she spoke, pretending she hadn’t noticed his attitude.

When girls say they're going to kill each other, they mean it.
 This was something else entirely though.
 Whoever was on the other side of the flimsy metal door I was hiding behind didn't just believe she would kill the other girl, she knew it, like someone who'd killed before.
 As scared as I was, I should have been a gibbering wreck, but strangely enough part of my mind was coldly rational.
 If I walked out right now I might be okay.
 If however they did kill the brunette, they'd come after me too.
 It was possible, it turned out, to be rational but still completely paralyzed by indecision.
 The girl was sobbing now, and my heart felt like it was about to tear itself into pieces.
 The creak of the bathroom door opening should have been a relief.
 I was expecting the tension to evaporate once there were more witnesses.

She was still whispering, but the words sheared through the darkness, arresting my fall.
 I didn't want him here, didn't want to give him another reason to despise me.
 What if Jasmin came with him?
 The thought of lying helpless with her in the same room sent shivers of cold sliding down me.
 I couldn't see, so I reached out, blindly trying to find the phone before Rachel could dial Alec.
 My questing hand finally found the tiny, hard-plastic package, and I grabbed on with all of my fading strength.
 The darkness was still beckoning, but alternating images of Jasmin and Alec flashed before my eyes.
 I was so confused that I couldn't make sense of the flood of emotions that accompanied the pictures, other than the fact that terror came to the forefront as they sped up.
 Faster and faster the two figures changed places, and then they disappeared.
 It was like my mind was a computer that'd overheated and had to reboot.

A whip.
 Oh yes, this would hurt.
 I loosed my cloak and pitched it aside, lowering myself in a defensive stance, hands out and ready.
 Crack!
 Okay, not ready.
 “Ow!

 Blood trickled from the strike point.
 Ruby giggled.
 “Okay, we start slower.” She considered for a moment.

“Imeralda, can you do me a favor?” Rodregas asked.
 “Of course, but I am not sure how I can help,” she said.
 Rodregas nodded, but said, “Can you go around to the other top finishers and talk to them, and also go around tonight to the other squires and try to get a feel for them.
 See if  you can find out who people want to win and why?” Imeralda was clearly confused by the odd request, but nodded, and after a little talk she slipped away to the food line and within moments was in an animated discussion with a few squires at another table.
 Rodregas thought Doi’van might ask, but he showed no interest and instead said, “While most of the knights are too high and mighty to talk to a Hellborn, the staff is not so closed mouthed.
 The greater sigils are said to be guarded twenty four hours a day in a great chamber in the very heart of the Cathedral.” “And did you ask if sworn men were allowed in with a new knight?” asked Rodregas with a smile.
 “Actually the topic did come up,” said Doi’van with a chuckle like rocks in a land slide.
 “While guards are usually not allowed in, it is not unusual for close friends or advisors to go in with some of those of the blood; to share their wisdom on the best possible greater sigils to take on.” “I will assume,” said Rodregas, “that they had never heard of a Nymph entering the chamber, much less one of the Hellborn?” “AElves are not uncommon and actually more Orqui than I expected.
 One servant thought that Nymphs used to go in during his father’s, father’s time, but not any time recently.
 No one could even imagine a Hellborn going into the Chamber,” agreed Doi’van.

I love to walk in the garden.” “So that one morning, there was just a-a door or something.
 All the other mornings there wasn’t.
 So just because you tried hard this morning, that doesn’t mean that trying hard tomorrow or the next day or the next won’t work.” She smiled.
 “That’s true.” “So you’ll keep trying.” “Yes.” “Now I’m sad.”  He met her eyes and then looked away.
 “I’m sorry.”  She hugged him, laying her head on his shoulder.
 “I just wish I could make you happy.” “You do.”  She raised her head to look at him.
 “You do make me happy, Rick.
 It’s just that .

Creole Myers:  	In looking back at what we’ve covered before, what we discussed yesterday, it seems scattered.
 What I’d like to do is take a more systematic approach today.
 Try to get a coherence, a sense of narrative out of your story.
 So, I’d like you to start at the beginning.
 Talk as long as you want, divert as often as you’d like, but let’s go from Idlewild to L.A., if you can, from Uke to Martin, so to speak.

If he wanted to attack, she would follow them.
 How could someone so young and inexperienced be so brave?
 How could he not honor such bravery?
 Rodregas looked into Imeralda’s eyes.
 She had been watching him.
 There was no need for words, no argument.
 The decision was made, they only need direction.
 Any hope for success laid in playing to their strength.
 Rodregas said, ”Doi’van, you stay here and use the bow.
 You start from the middle of the caravan as soon as you feel comfortable, and focus on the slavers.

So much is lost now, so little written down, so little recorded.
 For those with the stamina to search it out, Black Lung made one album, released on the Pepper label, a little Memphis soul mixed in with their own acid-blues.
 It was called Turntable Poison.
 Some say it sounded like The Rascals crossed with Hot Tuna.
 One cut comes to mind, a piece they played in every set at The Shell, the ballad, “Mr.
 Handy and Hakel-Bärend.”  On the LP they insisted on the extended version with Buddy’s long, side-handed solos, slick as molten lead and the twelve minute drum solo by Skippy Quetzalcoatl, effectively killing the album’s potential sales but insuring the group a spot in infamy alongside the lost tapes of Mudboy and the Neutrons and the missing five hours of von Stroheim’s Greed.
 There was also the shorter, “Blues for Wendy Ward,” with its plaintive chorus, “Thank you for at least that sweet ache,” a phrase Buddy made sound like a supplication to the gods.
 “Wendy Ward” got some air play around the country, on the late night FM stations, a minor flickering fame which only whet Buddy’s appetite for more, for larger radio audiences, larger followings, more groupies, better food backstage.
 He wanted it all, Buddy did.
 No one asked him, What is all?

He wet a washcloth for her and one for himself.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, handing her a washcloth as she straightened.
 "I should keep all these disturbing thoughts to myself."
 With trembling hands, she began washing her face.
 "I feel torn completely in two.
 I don't think I can ever be happy again.
 When I go back, I'll be miserably lonely for you.
 But if I were to stay here, I'd miss my family, my home, my roots.
 I'd feel misplaced.
 I'd worry about my family and how upset they are and how they'd always wonder what had happened to me."

It was the only real symbol that he could think of.
 “What of the others?” she asked.
 Rodregas was confused by her question and asked, “What others?” Karun answered, “There are a lot of very good squires here, honorable men and women who could benefit from the sigil.” Rodregas’ head was spinning at the idea.
 They were already being hunted by the Immortalists, and gaining some allies was not a bad idea.
 But their luck would only hold so far.
 Doi’van spoke now, trying hard to be quiet, “Only men you would swear have a strong sense of honor and no one who would serve the Immortalists.” Karun glanced around the room nervously at Doi’van’s voice; it was just not made for covert conversations and his words were very dangerous.
 Then she nodded thoughtfully and the four quickly agreed that they would share the sigil with anyone who were skilled, honorable and had no love for the Immortalist Guild.
 They returned to their rooms that night tired; they had tracked down twelve more squires.
 All had at least two ribbons; and all swore secrecy at the source of their sigil.
 The biggest surprise was probably Geriodon, who had beaten Rodregas earlier that day.

My wife lay with him for hours rubbing his back and keeping fluids in him.
 He went from cold to hot and back again.
 In a couple of weeks he was looking much healthier and we sent him out into the world again.
 Turns out, just because I did drugs and knew people who were addicted to drugs I was still not qualified to understand how to break someone from craving the drugs that satisfy their addiction.
 Brandon seemed better and we thought we had helped him simply because we incarcerated him at home away from his peers until he had the drugs out of his system.
 In our mind, he was cured.
 Unfortunately, the problem had not been solved so easily.
 Like any good movie, this solution came too easily and too early in the drama.
 He was such a child then, easily influenced and dealing with challenges in counterproductive ways.
 He was caught being truant, being out past curfew, being with a kid who stole a wallet.

“I know,” she said, “but it’s still fun.” I wondered if she did know.
 Like everyone before.
 I pushed the thought from my head.
 “I thought the dogs were their weapons of choice,” I said, cringing a bit as I remembered their demonstration.
 “Wolves, Frey.
 And they aren’t weapons.” “They don’t use them to attack?” She spoke like she was explaining to a child.
 “Yes, the wolves attack.
 But not as weapons.

The crowd, packed so tightly that I'd been worried someone was going to get pushed over the railing, separated as Alec flowed down the stairs.
 I'd only thought Isaac and Vincent were graceful.
 Alec made them look like drunken frat boys.
 Vincent spun around so fast it almost looked like he was going to fall down and then backed away from both of them like a cornered animal.
 It was hard to decide whether my excitement at seeing the biggest jerk I'd ever met humbled outweighed my dislike for Alec, who'd pretty much locked up the honor of being the second biggest jerk.
 A surge of dread washed through me as Vincent backed closer to the wall in an effort to maintain his distance from Alec.
 I half expected for the incredible tension I'd been feeling before to disappear, but instead it morphed slightly.
 If I hadn't known it was absolutely absurd, I would've said it felt like there was a tingly wind blowing down the stairs, pushing Vincent along before it.
 Isaac moved slightly.
 It was a small change of position, but somehow incredibly menacing.

I don’t think he would forgive me any time soon if he found out.
 Just don’t say anything about it, no matter what, please.
 Liz – Ok ok, I won’t say anything, but I think we should still press charges against his father.
 Jim – There’s no way to prove it, now please drop the whole subject, and try to forget about it.
 Liz – I told you I would.
 God don’t you believe me?
 Jim – well there was that time…
 Liz – Stop bringing that up!
 God, don’t you people ever forget anything.
 Jim – Not something THAT funny.

His entire body had vanished.
 I half expected to feel his touch—perhaps he’d merely camouflaged himself—but my hand was empty.
 I looked around, baffled.
 The makeshift audience wore easy, amused smiles.
 They watched me, not the vacant space from which Grey had evidently disappeared.
 And then I noticed someone beside me who hadn’t been there before… it was him.
 “How…” But he was gone again.
 I’d been staring right at him and had no idea where he’d gone.
 I was just beginning to doubt whether I’d seen him at all when I spotted him standing across the circle, grinning fiendishly while he dangled an object from his hands.
 It was the feather Ruby had tied in my hair.

I tried to see my attacker, to think of the magic to protect myself.
 “What are you doing?” It would have been a yell it if wasn’t hissed.
 The tone was harsh and I recognized it at once.
 “Oh,” I managed.
 Part of me was saying calm down, but the other was screaming I was still in danger.
 “Chevelle… I…” I didn’t have an answer.
 What was I doing?
 He released his grip just a fraction.
 “I went to your room and you were gone.” He shook his head.
 “I thought I had to come out here to get a search party.” “I, uh… you were in my room?” He straightened, his expression making it clear he hadn’t expected that response.

 “Your name is your brother’s, only backwards.”
 “Yup,” Harruq laughed.
 “Mum was always smart for an orc.

 Bet she did that on purpose.”
 “Yes, but why?”
 Harruq shrugged.

Perhaps there was still time to pull them from the necromancer’s cold fingers.
 Aurelia turned and ran for the forest.
 Dieredon had not known of her spying, but she would tell him everything.
 If there was any hope, it was in his skill with blade and bow.
 To free the puppets, one must cut the strings.
 It was time for Dieredon to slay the man in black.

 My be-all and end-all.
 I realize outsiders can’t understand—they see, what, witchcraft or some kind of nefarious necromancy at work.
 Shit, man, it’s love.
 You know, LOVE?
 I wrote that song because Lorelei changed my life.
 It’s like “Julia”, you know, the Lennon song?
 Julia as all-women.
 That’s Lor.
 She’s the feminine principle, the earth-mother, female rain, Moon Goddess.

The village and surrounding meadows and forests were the only home I’d had, the only place I’d known.
 It wasn’t exactly a comforting place, but there was something to be said for knowing where you were, where to find food, shelter, and water.
 I’d been filled with determination when I’d started running, concentrating on north and nothing else.
 But as I made my way, I became aware of the sheltered life I’d been living.
 The land here started to roll, the trees a deeper green, their trunks too narrow.
 It didn’t seem as if I’d gone that far, only half a day following Chevelle and then this time on my own.
 The changes here made me anxious to see the North.
 I glanced at my palm once more.
 I thought I’d figured out most of the lines—creeks curving through the landscape, mountains a jagged ridge across the top—but there were still a lot of unanswered questions.
 My hand squeezed into a nervous fist, but I kept moving.

That captured my imagination, I guess, and I was sitting in the garden drinking tea and thinking about you, imagining what you were like and what your life must have been like before your marriage.
 And then-and then you walked into my garden.” “Incredible.”  She stared up at him.
 “But how?
 I mean, how did that .
 .

 open the door or whatever?
 Had you ever done that before?” “No.”  He shrugged.
 “I was really lonely and falling in love with a girl in a book.
 Maybe God decided to take mercy on me.” “Oh, Rick.”  Her eyes filled with tears.

Alec's eyes had taken on the serious, resigned expression that'd become disturbingly commonplace lately.
 "I know.
 I think that last part bothers me the most, but I find myself doing so nevertheless.
 Make sure you wait at least half an hour.
 There's a definite element of danger to all of this."
 ** I must have checked the clock sixteen times during the last five minutes of the obligatory half-hour.
 The sensible, grownup part of me was arguing for another five minutes just to make sure, but I told that part to take a flying leap and all but ran through the house looking for Donovan.
 "Yes, mistress?
 Do you need something?"
 "Donovan, Alec said I could go watch them work out.

If Alec hadn't stopped them I think they probably would've killed me."
 "Undoubtedly, but don't let it bother you, sweetie.
 This has been all but inevitable since Alec's father died.
 From the moment they were born, I could tell that both Alec and Brandon had been gifted with uncommon potential for power."
 My blank look apparently made her take pity on me.
 "I'm sorry.
 I forget you're not aware of my special gift.
 I see inside people.
 Shape shifters really, but every once in a while normal humans as well.
 I can see their potential, and when they develop gifts, I can see the shape those gifts have taken."

All of the time.
 Until now we always thought someone had to be a shape shifter to do that."
 "But I'm just a normal person.
 Why would I appear different than anyone else?"
 Alec's shrug was enough to send my heart racing again, but not enough to distract me from his words.
 "With shape shifters, we believe it's because the animating energy, the soul if you will, burns more brightly than normal.
 I think it's tied in with what allows us to shift forms.
 With you, there isn't any obvious reason, but I think that Dominic has probably hit upon the root of the matter."
 His pause this time wasn't just to collect his thoughts; I could tell he was tempted not to tell me whatever he was thinking.
 "You know that our legends indicate a belief we were created in order to watch over and protect humans?

You can't even go hiking anymore..." I'd already realized Britney wasn't the type to think twice before words actually left her mouth.
 Curious.
 "What do you mean we can't go hiking?"
 She was looking around at the other students.
 "Nothing, come on.
 We're going to be late for class."
 I followed without a word, even more intrigued now.
 'Cool' people don't sweat tardiness and Britney really wanted to be cool.
 A slender, frumpy-looking woman looked up from her desk as Britney and I walked in.
 I held up my form, which she took without reading it.

“My mother was a power-hungry wench seeking notoriety.
 She was an elemental fairy and, like me, sported a fine head of red hair.” She ran a hand under the curls for emphasis.
 “She heard a story one day of a mixed-species birth and got it in her head she could breed a more powerful magic.
 Apparently she thought she could control her offspring and use the magic to her advantage… I suppose she thought she could rule the world.” Ruby smirked.
 “She studied various species for a few moons and decided her best chance at conquest was a dark elf.
 She made her way to this very village and happened across my father, poor unsuspecting sap.” Ruby flitted her fingers, glasses and wine served before each of us as she continued.
 “So there he was and she, just a wisp of a woman, flew up to him and blew a little fairy dust… well, you know about that.” I narrowed my eyes at her.
 Ruby grinned.
 “He was putty in her hands.
 It was all over before he even knew her purpose.

Do you want me to make it sound deep and inspired?
 Or do you prefer open and honest?
 Liz – Open and honest, it’s easier and more helpful that way.
 Art – Are you sure?
 Because given some time I can actually sound like I have a clue what I’m talking about.
 It’s not as useful per-say, but it sounds a lot better if you ever decide that you need a quote for a newspaper advertisement.
 You could have a picture of a handsome male model smiling and giving a thumbs-up sign with the line ‘Art says: this stuff is terrifatastic!’
 Liz – I’m sure.
 I need some feedback on my work, and mother isn’t saying anything but ‘mmmmm hmmmm, I like that’ and ‘no no no no, that would never sell Darling.’  So far my mother is the only person who I’ve talked to about it, and she only thinks about my work in a monetary fashion.
 It’s hard to grow without any criticism to help me light my way.

The silver-haired elves and their dogs were nowhere in sight.
 My gaze caught Steed, who was watching me.
 I always forgot how strikingly handsome he was until I looked right at him.
 He wore a thin, loose shirt now, rolled at the sleeves and covered by a leather vest.
 It matched the long cuffs on his forearms, the same dark, worn leather of his saddles.
 He stepped closer, taking my chin in his hand to examine my face in the moonlight.
 He purred something toward Ruby about her decorations and gave me a wink as he walked off in the direction Chevelle had gone.
 We were alone then, Ruby and I, and I was sure this was going to hurt more than my other training.
 She untied her cloak and tossed it to land with a muffled sound on the rocks.
 She was smiling a touch as she reached a hand across her waist, closing her fist around a black hoop I’d not seen before.

“I can’t hear you.” Emily snapped.
 “I WAS OUT SCOUTING!” he shouted, “Now can you hear me?” “Yes, and now you’ve made me deaf!” Emily yelled back.
 “Why were you out scouting in the first place?” I asked calmly, trying not to shout it out like Emily.
 Seth gripped the handlebars and I knew he was losing his temper.
 “I was being cautious so we didn’t have to worry last night,” He said through gritted teeth.
 He was lying and both of us knew that.
 I glared at him, “Nice story Seth, now what really happened?” He didn’t say anything and he rode ahead to get beside Jason, who was in the lead.
 The park slowly came in view.
 It was a huge grass circle with a small play set in the middle covered in kids.
 The woods surrounded it except for the side that faced the street.

It was a thin, vine that was about a foot long.
 It felt like a ribbon to me and I shrugged.
 I don't usually wear ribbons and bows; that was Emily's style.
 I pulled my hair back and tied the vine.
 It kept my hair out of my face and acted like a rubber band.
 “Thanks Emily,” I said.
 She finished tying her hair back.
 “No problem.
 We should look for somewhere to stay for the night.” I looked around, but everywhere was bare ground, hill after hill.
 “I don't see any caves.” “We'll just have to sleep in the open,” she stated and pointed to a huge tree.

With such swiftness, Rodregas reasoned, he must have a sigil of speed.
 He headed right for Doi’van and was behind Rodregas before he could do anything.
 Doi’van must have seen him coming from his position and he dropped his bow and pulled his great sword.
 The guard must have been thinking “Forest Nymph” due to the nature of the archery attack from the forest because he was unprepared for the strength of the blow.
 Like the one Rodregas had hit, the sword failed to cut armor.
 The guard, with the speed of his sigil, blocked it.
 But he blocked it sword to sword instead of using the momentum and speed to simply guide the sword away from his body.
 The resulting blow had an unpleasant sound and cut right through Doi’van’s sword.
 Unfortunately for the guard, Doi’van stepped forward as he swung and jammed the lower half of the sword into his opponent’s chest.
 The guard flew into the bushes with a sickening crunching sound.

Sleep came to him almost instantly.
 In Rodregas’ life he had experienced several very unpleasant ways of waking up, but this was the worst: a searing hot pain stabbed into his stomach!
 He reared up from his mat, but he felt hands holding him down onto the mattress.
 It was dark, but he could see in the dim light of the moon that someone was shoving a knife into his belly.
 He knew that in the next couple of seconds, his actions would decide his fate.
 He was bleeding, so he would be losing strength as well.
 Whoever his assailants were, they had him trapped.
 Rodregas violently kicked out with one leg, but his stabbing attacker avoided the blow.
 He did let up on the knife for a second though.
 Instead of following up, Rodregas used the momentum of his kick to swing his body sideways.

I won't stop you."
 I felt things I hadn't realized were knotted up relax inside me.
 When my voice finally came out it was smaller than normal.
 "Thank you."
 Alec shrugged and gave me another smile.
 "You must have driven your parents crazy with that refusal to back down."
 "I suppose I might have frustrated them a time or two."
 "And to think Rachel says I'm stubborn."
 I started to smile, but stopped as he cocked his head to the side in what was unmistakably a listening posture.
 "What's the matter?

“I’m just riding the wind, Frey.” “Oh, so you don’t know where we’re going either?” He laughed.
 “No, I know where we are going.
 It’s only that I don’t know where we’ll end up.” I didn’t know what was going to happen either.
 I thought of the tracker and realized what a good distraction the book had been.
 “Steed?” “Frey?” I smiled but it fell away quickly.
 “How will we get to council?
 I mean, how do we find them?” He wasn’t smiling anymore either.
 “Well, there’s a good chance they’ll be looking for us.” Of course, and they would all come together.
 It was clear we were too strong for one or two, they would need to attack as a group.
 Or pick us off one by one.

 Harruq relished the feeling of true combat against skilled opponents.
 One would slash out, hoping for an opening, then back away as the other guard lunged, preventing Harruq from any chance to counter.
 Blood ran down his arms and sides from several minor cuts.
 The pain was good.
 It helped focus his mind.
 It also fed his rage.
 “Kill me,” he shouted to one guard after another hit and fade.

“You'll lead us into a dragon's cave if you take the lead.” Seth rolled his eyes again.
 “Fine!” I walked through the trees and took a right.
 The trees parted and the trees ended.
 Right ahead of me was a cave.
 “Found a cave, that wasn't too hard Seth,” I said.
 “Right,” he said.
 “So what are we waiting for?
 Let's go!” I ran towards the cave, eager to get out of the rain and into somewhere dry.
 I stopped in front to catch my breath.
 Emily, Jason, and Seth ran up behind me and we stared into the cave.

He quickly dressed and felt much better once armored.
 He had spent most of his adult life in armor; he just could not relax when he wore only clothes.
 Rodregas then looked around; the keep armory was pretty basic with casks of arrows and spears, and some of the older used short swords and bows on the wall.
 There were only two truly powerful weapons like those used by a member of the Immortal Guards – the soldiers that enforced the rule of the Immortalist Guild of the Celestial Path who ruled all the Eastern Kingdoms and neither of these weapons were kept in the armory.
 He looked over to the short swords laying on one of the tables and picked two of them up; they felt a little weird.
 The swords were too light and the balance seemed off as he took a few practice strokes.
 There was a large two-handed great sword, a weapon that was difficult to handle if you were not very strong, and its sheath matched the armor he now wore.
 Rodregas picked it up and took a few swings and found that it was not as clumsy as he thought it would be.
 It was of average make, and he did not like such large swords.
 The weight provided a lot of momentum and power for a strike, but if you missed it was hard to recover and very easy to leave yourself wide open for a counter strike from your opponent.

 Eugene – Johnny did when he got back a couple minutes ago.
 He’s my current hero.
 Liz – I wonder how long that will last.

I need something else to think about."
 It was a bit of a white lie.
 As soon as he'd touched me everything else ceased to matter.
 "Once upon a time the Sun and the Earth loved each other.
 So much so that the Sun sent her children down to live upon the Earth's face."
 I was relaxing so quickly that I wasn't sure how much longer I would be able to stay awake, but his story was already different than any other I'd heard, and I resolved I wasn't going to miss any of it.
 As long as he was willing to talk I was going to fight off sleep.
 "Something happened though to break the bonds between the Sun and the Earth.
 Some say the Earth insulted the Sun, who is incredibly vain.
 Others believe the Sun's children marred the face of the Earth, and that when she refused to discipline her wayward family, the Earth swore in his wrath to destroy them."

“You needn’t bother yourself with him.” She could see I would.
 “Chevelle Vattier.
 He’s from a northern clan.
 He’ll be here only a short while.
 Council business.” That brought me back to my mission.
 “Fannie said there was some trouble with Evelyn?” I asked.
 “Yes.” There was something in her tone I didn’t recognize.
 “She’s fine now.” “I was… yesterday, I saw her.” “Yes.” She half-smiled.
 “Don’t worry yourself, Freylinda.
 Come now, let’s study.” I hesitated.

 Haven't you noticed?"
 She had, but she'd assumed that those weren't decent women, that they were the type to have love affairs with their husbands' brothers.
 Some women in 1927 frequently showed cleavage, but not as much as she'd be showing in these bathing suits.
 And their legs weren't completely uncovered at the same time.
 Swallowing, she considered.

Liz – Very funny Jim.
 Jim – I’m serious, Gene and I talked the whole scenario over for days, stabbing myself is the best way to get away from your mom, and by best I mean the way I spend the least time in jail.
 Liz – You brought Gene into this before you talked to me about it?
 Wait, does she hit on Gene too?
 Jim & Liz – No.
 Jim – Can you imagine anyone who knows Gene actually hitting on him?
 Liz – If they were drunk maybe.
 Jim & Liz - Really drunk.
 Liz – Sorry, I just blurted that out, didn’t think first.
 Jim – Can your mom even drink that much, without passing out soon after anyway?

Industrial estates, export processing zones, export promotion councils, export insurance, warehouse receipts, quality standards, and thousands of other organizational innovations have been either created or borrowed by developing countries to accelerate social progress.
 A comprehensive study of successful systems and institutions that can be transferred and adapted to local conditions will document the enormous untapped potential for stimulating faster economic and job growth by inventing, imitating and further improving social systems.
 Action Plan to Stimulate Employment in Developing Countries
 Employment generation is a product of multiple factors that combine together.
 Stimulating job creation requires a comprehensive approach, rather than partial policies or piecemeal strategies.
 The achievements of the Newly Industrializing Economies (NIEs) of East Asia demonstrate that tremendous increases in employment generation can be achieved based on comprehensive strategies.
 While broad prescriptions should not be indiscriminately applied to the widely disparate situations confronting different countries, the availability of a number of tested methods under lines the fact that effective and proven policy measures can be formulated to meet the employment needs of every developing country.
 A number of the strategies briefly listed below are enlarged upon in sub sequent chapters of the report, but listed here for the purpose of comprehensiveness
 1.Emphasize agriculture: Utilize agriculture as a source of economic growth and job creation by a shift to high value-added, commercial crops, supported by policy measures to upgrade technology, improve skills, raise productivity, ensure the supply of essential inputs, establish marketing and distribution chan nels, create linkages between agriculture and industry, and cater to export markets.
 2.Promote small enterprises: Promote small enterprises by policies to make technology, training, credit, marketing and distribution channels more easily accessible to small business, and by forging linkages between universities, research institutes and small enter prises.

She could have run faster without the child!”
 No, he knew that answer.
 She would not abandon her child just as he would not abandon Qurrah.
 Then what was bothering him so?
 He fell to his knees and stabbed the old weapons into the dirt.
 The faces of those he had killed danced before his eyes, especially the mother and her child, and the young girl holding her little sister.
 The fear in their eyes.
 The screams.
 The panic.
 Horror.

Why would he have a young girl’s diary?
 It was filled with pointless stories as far as I could tell, but after a few pages the writing matured and it seemed to jump several years.
 I wished it was dated.
 I tire so easily of the formalities here.
 The only thing I have to look forward to are the few breaks I get to go out on my own, into the pines.
 Father has increased my work periods to every other day.
 Combined with my other duties, I am stationed in the castle almost all week.
 The magic practice exhausts me or I would sneak out at night, the way I enjoyed as a child.
 It doesn’t seem fair.
 My sister is practically ignored.

If you take it to the edge, which you have to do to play rock and roll, every fucking time, eventually, well, you’re gonna pitch over, dig?
 You’re gonna go over that edge because that’s why you’re doing it—to get closer and closer.
 Playing electric, like the blues, like the devil music from which it came, you just gotta give it the juice, you gotta play for all the money.
 Man, I did that, I could feel it.
 Feel the devil chasing me down.
 But, it’s a high, right?
 Like all good highs there are consequences.
 But, I’ve never changed direction, man.
 I’m going in a straight line.
 When it’s all over you’ll see the line.

She saw a deep, red scratch on his left cheek and the way he winced every time he moved his right arm, she could tell she must have injured it.
 “Do you know where the others are?” she asked him.
 He shook his head.
 “No, they’re just gone.” “We’re separated?” she said nervously.
 “Yes,” he replied.
 “What do we do?” “Why are you asking me?” she demanded.
 “You’re the one who comes up with plans.” Emily paced back and forth, trying to think.
 Where were Seth and Jazell?
 Were they okay?
 More importantly, where were they?

 But he’s sure about it.
 Liz – Wow.
 Jim – That’s what I said.
 Liz- You’re taking it awfully well.
 Jim – Why shouldn’t I?
 Liz – I don’t know, it just seems that in movies, when a character’s parent meets another person or gets married the character is always against it.
 And then they usually seem to come up with a scheme to get their parents back together.
 Jim – A scheme to get mom and dad back together, I never thought of that…hmmm, that actually wouldn’t be a bad idea.

 Months later, Harruq awoke at the dawn, jerking upward and uttering a sharp gasp.
 A constant cry of danger rang in his ears.
 A quick survey showed he slept alone in their small shed, his brother missing.
 “Qurrah?” he dared ask.
 “Outside,” came Qurrah’s muffled reply.
 Harruq stretched, pushed away a plank of wood from the window, and climbed out.
 The sun was halfway visible, the standard noises of the city only in their infancy.
 Leaning against the shed, his eyes staring off toward the sunrise, waited Qurrah.
 “What are you doing out here?” Harruq asked.

As I have freely admitted, I experimented with drugs in the seventies and the eighties and was no stranger to the signs of his drug use or the possibility of drug dealing.
 I knew all too well what could be ahead if he didn’t change his lifestyle.
 I had lost a couple of close friends to drug overdoses and a couple I knew were in prison.
 My own older brother had been sent to prison for drug dealing and although he had long been free from incarceration, he will never be free from his issues surrounding addiction.
 My biological father is an alcoholic, refusing to acknowledge his addiction and destroying any chance of being part of my youth or my children’s (his grandchildren’s) lives.
 Watching drugs tear apart my family and kill my friends had sent me in the opposite direction as an adult, as a husband and as a father.
 Soon Lisa and I couldn’t ignore Brandon’s behavior.
 Hoping it would just go away or that he would grow out of it like I did didn’t seem likely.
 His grades were terrible, and he kept getting in trouble for being in the wrong place at the wrong time or with the wrong person.
 For instance, he was put on probation for being in a car with someone who was in possession of a replica firearm.

The elders express their anxiety again that the humans will consume us, but my father is already discussing arranged marriages, even mentioning Rune’s son, of all people.
 He’ll do anything he can to gain power from her.
 It was hard to read, this diary.
 My mother’s diary.
 Her writings went on until they became more erratic, answering questions I didn’t want answered.
 My father has taken Freya from me.
 He has assigned her tasks, Rune watching over her, testing her.
 It’s just as Junnie feared—just what he’d done to my mother.
 I will find a way to stop him.
 ~ The elders are keeping Freya now.

She lay there for a few more minutes, but she was too restless to keep lying still, especially with no one to talk to.
 So at last she jumped up and ran into the waves.
 Rick woke up slowly with no idea of how long he'd been asleep.
 It had been an exhausting week, and he'd gotten less sleep than usual.
 Of course, he'd had much more fun than usual too, he thought with a lazy smile.
 He turned to see if Marie was asleep.
 She wasn't there!
 Springing to his feet, he looked around.
 The beach had become crowded while he was asleep, and he didn't see her anywhere.
 "Marie!"

“Yes, now go!”
 Harruq kicked open the barricaded door and then barged up the stairs.
 Qurrah withdrew a few pieces of bone from a pouch.
 He tightened his grip about them, whispering a few words of magic as he did.
 Then he looked to the window.
 He could barely see a bow and part of a hand.
 Qurrah waited.
 The Neldaren warriors charged, hoping to overwhelm their opponents before arrows took them all.
 The elf in the window leaned out to unleash a killing strike, but it was Qurrah who did the killing.
 Four pieces of bone leapt from his hand.

The first push was brutal.
 Screams of pain and the sound of clashing of metal on metal flowed into the city.
 Harruq watched an orc wielding two swords cut off the arm of one soldier, and, as the blood from the limb splattered across his face, he turned and decapitated another with two vicious hacks.
 The orc roared in victory only to die as a soldier shoved his sword in his side and out his back.
 “Will they make it through?” Harruq asked, in awe of the display.
 Qurrah glanced over the wall and then back to the main combat.
 Archers continued eviscerating the orc forces.
 If they could push into the city, their arrows would be a nuisance at best, but it seemed they had underestimated the human soldiers.
 “They are running out of time,” Qurrah said.
 “But they might.”

"I brought some."
 He went to take a bottle from a drawer.
 "I'm not as red as I was last Saturday."
 "Do you-do you want me to-to rub some on you?"
 He glanced up, on the verge of asking her why, since it was only his arms, not his back, that needed the lotion.
 Instead, he silently handed her the bottle.
 Marie squeezed some lotion into her hand.
 Starting at his wrist, she rubbed his arm, working her way up.
 When she reached the tan line where his sleeve began, her hands glided up to the red spot just below his neck.
 "You-you must not have put sunscreen here.

It was stupid to have risked a panic attack when I was already borderline depressed, but that was what I was looking at now.
 I'd picked a seat that wasn't visible from the doorway, so I just put my head down and let the twin traumas run their course.
 By the time I was feeling steady enough to leave the classroom, I had just enough time to make it to the bathroom and try to clean myself up before lunch ended.
 The rest of the day went in starts and stutters.
 I went from answering a question about the economy of post-Civil War Georgia, to watching Alec start putting together rough plans for our next group project.
 I had just enough time to notice he seemed relieved I wasn't trying to get in his way, and then Spanish was finishing up and I was headed to the tutoring lab.
 Most Friday afternoon sessions were pretty sparsely attended.
 Today was no different, which was a good thing since I probably wouldn't have done a very good job of explaining anything.
 Mrs. Campbell shut everything down before my shift started, and sent me home with a concerned look in her eye.
 Rachel skipped over to my table while I was still trying to get my books put away.

“Rise, slave,” Velixar commanded.
 “Your soul is trapped in your body and answers only to my command.”
 The naked elf rose, his eyes burning with red rage.
 The symbols on his body faded until they were but faint scars.
 “Give him his clothes,” Velixar ordered his student.
 Qurrah fetched a pair of black pants, a red shirt, and a black cloak, all of which Velixar had prepared before the brothers had brought the bloodless body to him.
 “Dress,” the necromancer ordered.
 Ahrqur growled some inane argument, but a glare from Velixar sent him cowering.
 “You must obey my every command, wretch, before you may return to the peaceful death you left.
 Fight me and you shall find your stay here lasting longer than your rotting body’s.”

The people running and screaming and dying were his clan.
 I knew the cloaks in that vision now, too.
 They were Grand Council.
 The council was circling my mother to stop her.
 She was killing the northern clans.
 I didn’t know why.
 And I didn’t know how I knew, but I was certain I didn’t want my memories back.
 What I had was already too much.
 I couldn’t fathom the pain Chevelle had suffered, surely a hundred times mine at the loss of my mother.

Even as I leaned in a little bit myself, my thundering heart seemed to be trying to leap out of my throat solely for the purpose of disrupting what looked very much like it was going to be my first kiss.
 Every tiny hair on my body stood up in a shiver of nervousness as he tilted his head to the side, and then he broke off, shaking himself slightly as he gave me a smile.
 For a second I thought he was rejecting me, that he'd decided not to kiss me because he wasn't interested.
 Only the way he reached out for my hand indicated that he really wasn't repulsed by me.
 It bothered me the entire time I was in History, and then just before I got to Physics it hit me.
 He hadn't stopped because he didn't want to kiss me.
 He stopped because with all of my blushing and near-terror it'd been obvious I wasn't ready to be kissed.
 It was the ultimate act of chivalry.
 I more or less floated through my last two classes.
 It wasn't until I finally got to tutoring that I started to put more stock in the idea that Rachel had simply chosen not to go to Les Misérables.

Yearning to avoid my thoughts altogether, I spent much of the day in the mind of my horse.
 And the day passed.
 It was evening again when we stopped.
 I barely noticed the group’s mood; though quiet, they seemed anxious and kept the perimeter close.
 Ruby brought me the book again and I took one long, deep breath before I started back.
 Freya is growing and strong.
 She has amassed a following of sorts, though I suspect it is somehow connected to her frailties.
 There is something endearing about it, but some of it worries me.
 She doesn’t seem to be able to hear as well as she should through her rounded ears and her voice is oddly alto.
 She is a beauty, though, her unusual features earning her extra attention.

“I said hit me, orc!” Aurelia shouted.
 Harruq snarled, and out came his weapons.
 He swung for her face, turning the blade at the last moment so the flat side struck her.
 The sword smacked off Aurelia’s cheek as if she were made of stone.
 The clear noise rang throughout the forest.
 “What the abyss was that?” Harruq asked.
 Aurelia laughed.
 “I’ve cast an enchantment that protects me from your blades.”
 Harruq looked at his weapons and then shrugged.
 “Interesting.

Let us reimagine it, if we can, in all its efflorescence.
 In all its pied beauty.
 Let’s hear again, “Turntable Poison” as if for the first time and marvel at the voice that said, “We are all naked.”  That said, “Love me for my limo but love me all the way.”  And, that said, presciently, “Death is only a way station, between West Memphis and the coast.” These interviews were done in three sessions in early 1973, in San Francisco, by Creole Myers, at Buddy Gardner’s home.
 Lorelei Enos was in and out.
 One of the startling revelations found in these tapes is that Lorelei was with Buddy until the end.
 Rumors had her abandoning him after they had left Memphis for Los Angeles.
 Stories circulated back home about her, unflattering stories all, about her working in the pornographic film industry, about her fixing Buddy that final fix, about her leaving him for a slick-talking Hollywood casting agent.
 What is made clear here is her devotion to him and his to her.
 In this way they resemble John Lennon and Yoko Ono, another vastly misunderstood couple.
 The tapes are in remarkably good shape, with only a few elisions, a few minutes of silence.

Once back at the beach house, he was drunk and he verbally abused my children to the point of terror, I was done.
 I will never see him again.
 I believe being a “Father” and a “sperm donor” are not at all one in the same.
 The years of my early fatherhood brought more lessons and experiences than I can share.
 We learned how to raise an eight year old when Brandon turned eight.
 We learned again how to raise an eight year old when Bryce turned eight.
 You get where I am going with this.
 I always found it ignorant when someone would advise me how to raise my child when they had no children at all or they had children younger than mine.
 The most absurd statements begin with the words “my children will never."
 I never offered advice to any parent, and I never welcomed a statement about raising my children that began with the words “you should.” I have always tried to be the best dad I could be, because it was up to me to make their upbringing different than mine.

Qurrah’s well of magic drained at frightening speed.
 He almost let go, but he thought of his brother, shaking under the spell of the skulls.
 _No,_ he thought.
 _Enough.
 Cease your chatter._
 He clutched tighter, the threads braiding into a giant rope in his mind.
 High above, the skulls quieted, and their fires dimmed.
 When the necromancer noticed Qurrah’s meddling, his mental link pulsed with incredible energy.
 Colors swarmed through his mind, dark purples and reds across a macabre canvas of black.
 He felt his chest tightening, his neck constricting.

“Would you accompany me into madness?” he asked.
 Harruq gave him a funny look, half a piece of bacon still hanging in his mouth.
 “Of course I would,” he replied.
 “If you go mad, I’ve got no chance in this world.
 You brains, me brawn, right?”
 “Yes,” Qurrah said absently.
 “That’s right.
 But would you kill?
 Without reason, without pause.
 Could you?”

She had no weapons dangling from her body were visible from where I was standing.
 “I have pink hair!
 Isn’t it cool?” She spun around so we could take in all of its bubblegum pink color.
 She looked at the bow slung over my shoulder and Seth’s gleaming sword.
 “Hey, I don’t have anything cool and deadly.
 Why do you both get something like that and I didn’t?
 It’s not like you can trust Jazell with something sharp or dangerous.” “Hey!
 We can’t trust you either.” I pointed out, crossing my arms.
 “Arming you is as scary as giving a kindergartener a knife.” She gasped.
 “Yeah, well, I’m ignoring you now.” She huffed and turned around.

You are a ruler among your people?” He laughed.
 “No, no.
 Noble is my given name, passed down for generations.
 Grand is the family name.” Generations?
 I was surprised again.
 I stepped closer, enthralled.
 “What are you doing here?” “We are searching for a good place to start over,” he explained.
 I was scrutinizing his blade.
 “Oh, well, I’m hunting.” He wasn’t as slow as I had thought, quite capable of conversation.
 I couldn’t help but wonder, “You were a bit… stunned before?” He flushed a pleasing shade of red.

“Is there something that I can help you with?” “I understand that your other servant, the Nymph girl, was out making inquires last night,” said Van’dret.
 Rodregas paused at that, unsure of how to respond.
 Finally, he said, “It is always good to know who your enemies are and who might be your friends.” “I don’t think you have many friends here,” said Van’dret.
 “I have those I need,” responded Rodregas, “I hear, on the other hand, that you are quite popular.
 They say that Nordien carries your colors and is your champion.” Rodregas thought he saw the Ambassador’s eyebrow rise slowly, but there was no hesitation to his response.
 “As an Ambassador to the knighthood I, of course, have no favorites.
 Though as one who works to join the Celestials in the Heavens, I do have an abiding dislike for anything that smells of the Infernal.” His voice was smooth, very reasonable, and intolerably smug.
 Rodregas spoke before he could help himself, “Really?
 Because I heard that you and Taiga rather liked the smell of the Infernal.
 In fact, I heard that it smells very familiar to you.” Rodregas immediately felt ice in his belly; he knew his hint at such knowledge was enough to turn Van’dret fully against him.

"I'm sorry, Marie."
 He hugged her, murmuring, "We won't give up.
 And one morning when you least expect it, you'll walk back into your own garden."
 Marie closed her eyes, drawing strength from Rick.
 She just hoped he was right.
 And she hoped it would happen soon.
 After Rick had left for work, Marie walked on the treadmill for nearly 45 minutes and then made herself a cup of tea.
 Rested, she opened the box containing the exercise movie Rick had gotten her and with delight put it into the BCR.
 No--VCR, she corrected herself.
 She got so involved in the exercises and then exploring the house that she'd only watched one of the movies--"Gone with the Wind," which made her laugh sometimes and cry sometimes and held her spellbound the entire time--by 5:30, when Rick got home from work.

Chapter 23 Someone was calling my name, but I really didn't want to wake up.
 I was still so tired, and I'd had the most wonderful dreams.
 They were a little foggy now, but they seemed to have involved Alec coming to my rescue, and then holding my hand as I went to sleep.
 It wasn't until I finally placed the familiar voice that everything started coming back to me.
 I sat up with an abruptness that nearly knocked Alec off of his perch on the edge of my bed.
 Him still being there, looking at me with a barely restrained amusement glimmering in his eyes, calmed my racing pulse.
 "You're still here."
 "You sound disappointed.
 Do you want me to leave?"
 His expression had taken on the guarded blankness I still hadn't learned how to read, so I wasn't sure whether he was joking or not.

If he had to be friends with some of these people out of responsibility, that was one thing, but letting them continue to be jerks was taking it too far.
 Nobody was more surprised than me when Brandon pushed back from the table, scanned the room, and then pulled me to my feet.
 We spent the rest of lunch pacing around the outside of the school while he worked through whatever was bothering him.
 When the warning bell finally rang, he turned and looked at me with a considering smile.
 We stood like that for a good thirty seconds before he reached a single finger up and traced the left side of my face as he leaned in slightly.
 It was simultaneously the scariest and most exciting thing I'd ever experienced.
 Even as I leaned in a little bit myself, my thundering heart seemed to be trying to leap out of my throat solely for the purpose of disrupting what looked very much like it was going to be my first kiss.
 Every tiny hair on my body stood up in a shiver of nervousness as he tilted his head to the side, and then he broke off, shaking himself slightly as he gave me a smile.
 For a second I thought he was rejecting me, that he'd decided not to kiss me because he wasn't interested.
 Only the way he reached out for my hand indicated that he really wasn't repulsed by me.

The double entry doors each featured a quartet of small windows.
 When the gatekeeper refused to let us in because the tickets were sold out, Kenny’s usual good nature expired.
 He raised a fist as though to sock the gatekeeper, a boy in an ROTC costume.
 But instead of punching the kid, he drove his fist through one of the small windowpanes.
 The gatekeeper hollered.
 The next instant, we found ourselves surrounded by teachers, coaches, and a platoon of the ROTC.
 While the chatter of several witnesses turned it all into gibberish, and the gatekeeper shouted, “They’ve been drinking,” Kenny stood still, staring at his bloody fist as though wondering how it happened.
 Out of the crowd, a coach came striding.
 He shoved me aside and tried to grab Kenny.
 Kenny bolted, splitting the crowd.

Ruby didn’t look like she could think of anything funny about what she’d said, but she continued.
 “Secondly, don’t cut yourself.
 These things are sharp.” She moved to toss the sword to me but reconsidered and handed it over, making sure I had a good grip.
 There were intricate designs carved on the handle and runes etched in the blade.
 It wasn’t as heavy as it appeared.
 I moved it around a bit, slashing wide arcs though the chill air.
 It was pleasant, nicely balanced in my hand.
 That didn’t mean I could actually cut through someone’s neck, though.
 “Ruby, how do you intend to teach me with this?
 I mean if there’s no messing around, just lop your head off and all?” She laughed.

She looked up, and then away guiltily as I walked in.
 There wasn't a trace of smile or greeting on her face, an abnormality that hit me hard somewhere in the region of my stomach.
 Albert stopped by to say hi, and I used his presence as a distraction.
 "It sounds like you're almost caught up."
 "Yeah, finally.
 I've got another two weeks or so, but then I'll be all done with this whole triple math homework garbage."
 Albert smiled, and for the first time I noticed how genuine his expressions were.
 It was almost like he was a different person when he wasn't concentrating on explaining some particularly stubborn math problem to one of the slower students.
 You know, the ones who still didn't understand why anyone needed to know their multiplication tables.
 "And here I had such high hopes for you becoming a true math geek.

I won't touch you or say a word."
 "All right."
 She closed her eyes and began thinking about Davis and how it felt to dance with him.
 She thought about her mother and father and brother and how they'd laughed and talked at meals before her brother had been disowned.
 She thought about Tom and the speakeasy.
 She opened her eyes to see Rick watching her anxiously.
 She swallowed.
 "I'm still here."
 "I'm sorry."
 "Maybe I should go walk in the garden.

God, to me, looks more like a vapor.
 And his whispering voice either sounds too much like my own to be surely authentic, or else it’s so soft, I’m not often sure I heard right.
 The Jesus I used to picture looked like a young Max Von Sydow in The Greatest Story Ever Told, and his expressions appeared more posed or acted than honestly human.
 But now he's beginning to look more like Eric.
 Eric possessed by Jesus, I can adore.
 I still see him.
 I can watch the lines of his face change as I tell him about my fears or longings.
 I can hear him speak thoughtful words.
 Fear v. Love
 While speeding on Interstate 5 north out of Sacramento past orchards and pastures, with long miles between the small towns, I think back to my talk with Toni, the part about suffering from panic attacks.

It wasn't until I felt the iron-hard muscles under my now-tingling hand that I realized what I'd done.
 I felt a surge of heat wash over my face and neck.
 Brandon for once didn't have an easy comeback to defuse the awkwardness.
 If anything he looked slightly uncomfortable himself.
 "I'm sure it's nothing important..." He trailed off as my traitorous hand found his arm of its own accord and started pulling again.
 I wasn't sure why I was so anxious; usually I avoided crowds like the plague.
 Maybe I was just trying to prolong our time together.
 I let go as soon as we reached the fringe of the crowd, and prayed it was only my imagination that made me think Brandon was just the slightest bit relieved.
 Luckily there was plenty to distract me.
 It looked like there'd been some kind of war behind the school.

BG: 	Well, you know he played clarinet with a supper-club band called Dick Delisi and the Syncopaters.
 They were fine, really fine.
 And Mr. Delisi came over to the house sometimes to dinner.
 A nice man, even a talented man.
 Could blow a barrelful of sax.
 But, they never talked music, never.
 I would question them about the band, what it was like performing, what particular songs they played.
 They would keep switching the conversation, keep it moving away from music and onto neutral topics like TV shows or the church.
 And, it took me years to figure out what was going on.
 It was my mother, see.

However, his assistant Korin had only been an Immortalist for a few decades; his victims and his power were still purely mortal.
 Rodregas had known that in a fair fight he could kill him.
 Korin was no warrior, and his actions spoke of cowardice when Korin hurt those who had no chance in a fight against him.
 Rodregas had been trying to get him alone, where he could kill him without blame, for years.
 Rodregas went over and reached down to grab the bottom of the heavily made bed, and almost fell over when the bed lifted far more easily than expected.
 The sound of wood screeched as weight switched to the back legs of the bed and then moved at his awkward action, and the top of the columns smashed against the plaster ceiling.
 Rodregas carefully lowered the bed back down; as the bed settled back to the floor he was covered by a light dusting of plaster from the damaged ceiling.
 Was Rodregas really that strong?
 Or was the bed just lighter than it looked?
 He went back over to the trunk and lifted it up; it to went up too easily and felt strangely light.

Riverside for a PhD in Comparative Literature.
 And at those schools, when she met a new crowd of young folks just launching out toward their dreams, she wondered how much she had given up by marrying a fellow who already thought about retiring, which caused me to wonder in turn if I should I steel myself to prepare for another breakup?
 And should I make sure that if it came I wouldn’t again have to slog through the morass of missing my kid.
 Pam continued vacillating.
 One month she would talk about our child-to-be.
 The next month, she would find any such talk distasteful and contend that that her schoolwork was all her mind could process.
 No kid until she passes her exams, I resolved.
 Last October, she passed them with distinction.
 The dissertation would take a year or two but, hoping she could read and write a little while pregnant and while caring for a baby, I suggested that now was the time, if ever.
 Sure, celebrities and other billionaires father kids when they’re ancient, but they can afford nannies who take screaming babies for walks in the park, and they can ship the kids off to boarding schools when as teenagers they metamorphose into demons.

"My parents sold their house and moved to Florida.
 They came here, and Teri did too, but it wasn't the same.

 She met his gaze.
 "And what if you hadn't even been able to be with them at all?"
 He swallowed.
 "I would have been very upset."
 Both picked at their food in silence.
 Rick glanced at Marie surreptitiously, wanting to gobble her up with his eyes but not wanting to explain his stare.
 He loved her so much.

He struggled to his feet and ran.
 More minutes passed.
 The glow of Woodhaven drifted behind him.
 Breathing was agony.
 Moving was torment.
 All his extremities grew cold and his head felt light.
 The pain in his shoulder threatened to send him into shock.
 It was just waiting for his body to succumb.
 His eyes searched for anything that could grant him cover.
 The forest was too far, and all about was shin-high grass.

He was strong and he let her feel his strength, but he also gave her plenty of leverage so that if she truly wanted to pull away she could.
 He was making his desire clear, but the decision was hers.
 He cared for her too much, and was so determined to walk the path of righteousness and he was determined to be very careful.
 A younger man would have been in a hurry.
 But Rodregas was lost in the softness of her lips, the look of her eyes, and the beauty of her spirit.
 He wished he could make this moment last forever.
 Rodregas believed that most women did not know if they were interested until a man makes his move.
 It is something instinctive; there is a single moment when either it clicks or it does not.
 The moment held unmoving, the dice were rolling; and she responded to his kiss, but did not sink into his arms.
 She was making a hard decision.

Not singing out loud, but making the power vibrate and move in a rhythm that matched the wood.
 When that magical rhythm was reached, the bow suddenly became almost fluid and moved nearly of its own volition.
 The arrows flew with incredible force and accuracy.
 The only problem was that the three could not practice freely as the arrows sometimes shattered on impact, as they flew with such force.
 Doi’van quickly mastered the spell and the use of the bow.
 Rodregas, on the other hand, struggled to learn the artistry of the spell.
 One afternoon, a few days after Doi’van had mastered the spell, Rodregas stood there with the bow trying hard to both find the rhythm of the spell and shoot the weapon.
 Imeralda stood next to him, her hand lightly touching the bow as she tried to figure out why he was still struggling with the mastery of the weapon.
 Rodregas reached down into himself, to that place that held his magic.
 Though Rodregas had never had much power, he had always enjoyed using his “itch” (as he had always called it) to do small things.

 "It really bothers you that everyone knows?"
 I shrugged uncomfortably.
 "I guess maybe it shouldn't, but it does.
 Nobody likes to be ridiculed, but it's even more than that.
 The attacks started up a couple of months ago.
 They...remind me of a really terrible thing that happened, so when people make a big deal out of them it's like it's all happening again."
 Rachel nodded slowly, her wonderfully expressive face full of sympathy.
 "I'm sorry to have pried like that.

She blushed, but after a moment, she stood on tiptoe and raised her face to press her lips against his.
 She wasn't sure how to begin a kiss, but that obviously wasn't going to be a problem: his lips began moving over hers the moment that they touched.
 When Rick released her, she gazed up at him anxiously.
 "You aren't upset, are you?"
 He caressed her cheek, dropping a light kiss on her lips.
 "No.
 I'm not upset."
 They went to the grocery store that evening and bought ingredients for the next day's dinner.
 Rick had called his sister, and she'd been thrilled Rick had a girl he wanted her to meet and mad that he hadn't invited her sooner.
 If Marie was going to make dinner at his house, they'd obviously been dating long enough to feel pretty comfortable together.

Jim – Didn’t say.
 Guess why doesn’t matter now.
 All that is left is that he did do it.
 Liz – Are you ok Jim?
 Jim – I’ve been better.
 Been worse too though.
 It’s like I lost something that I barely had in the first place.
 I don’t know how I feel yet.
 Liz – I think I’m going to go back upstairs and talk to Karen.
 Eugene – I’m going to go for a walk.

Her mother nodded.
 "When I was 17, I met a young man named Andrew.
 I was staying with my aunt on Martha's Vineyard for the summer, and his family had a cottage not far from my aunt's.
 He was a student at Harvard during the year, and he was planning to be a doctor.
 We were inseparable from the moment we met.
 We went out to dinner, went to parties, sometimes just sat quietly reading together.
 But best of all, we would walk or sit on the beach for hours talking.
 He was wonderful, and I loved him with all my heart."
 She paused, smiling as she reached out to touch a lock of Marie's hair.
 "Every time we kissed, I felt it all over."

I want you to all disperse and go to your home rooms."
 The short, mostly bald man who'd ordered us all to leave was just visible through a gap in the crowd.
 He walked like an administrator, but I hadn't ever seen him before.
 "Who's that?"
 Brandon started just a little, like he'd been thinking of something else.
 "Mr. Rindell, the assistant principal."
 Now that my complete attention wasn't on the various destroyed bits of school property, I noticed how much whispering was going on.
 Most of it was too quiet to catch more than bits and pieces, but I heard more than one 'completely jacked up', and a few people wondering what could have caused that kind of destruction.
 Mr. Rindell apparently heard much of the same snippets of conversation.
 "You would think by now you'd all be old enough to figure some of this out on your own.

“Please, Freya, try.” All I could do was nod.
 And then he stood and walked away.
 I sat unmoving for a moment, and then finally glanced at the group.
 They were deeply involved in their conversations, seemingly unaware of the encounter that had my heart in my throat.
 I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, attempting to “move about” in my mind.
 It was completely frustrating.
 Fuzzy, wrong.
 Nothing worked.
 None of it connected the way it should have.
 It made me angry and tired and the maddening fight against it gained me nothing but a buzzing headache.

I finished processing everything about the time Alec turned and walked back.
 I opened my mouth to protest, but he shook his head at me as we all fell into formation around him.
 From what little I knew about Alec's pack, it wasn't uncommon for them to spend time together without the kind of chest-beating byplay that was so much a part of Brandon's group, but our lunch table was even more subdued than I'd expected.
 Faced with an almost complete lack of conversation, I didn't have the courage to ask some of the questions on my mind.
 It wasn't until I'd followed Isaac to my history class that I finally worked up the nerve to find out more of what was going on.
 Once the substitute had called roll, and then more or less turned the class loose for a 'group study session', I turned to Isaac and whispered my first question.
 "This fight between Alec and Brandon, it's for real?
 I mean they aren't just going to fight until first blood, are they?"
 Isaac's nod was hesitant, like he knew I was headed towards things he wasn't supposed to tell me.
 "I'm afraid the contest is quite serious, but still nothing for you to worry about."

I had always supposed his prescience was shadowy.
 But maybe not.
 By that Sunday morning when he showed up at Kenny Niedermeyer's, he might have gotten the whole message.
 I think about standing outside the basketball gym a month before his last day, when Eric could easily have run like he insisted Billy and I do.
 But he said “I’m going to stay and take my punishment.” “For what?” I asked, and he didn’t answer.
 For what?
 I still want to know.
 A favorite mystery writer of mine, Ross McDonald, earned this praise from a reviewer: “McDonald doesn’t write about crime.
 He writes about sin.” I think back to the day I spent asking kids whether they often felt guilty about something but had no idea what it was.
 Though I didn’t understand at the time, I was asking if they felt the darkness in their nature, the affinity for sin.

Alec crossed over to me and ran a finger down the side of my face.
 "Only you could manage to make a joke out of having fallen in with monsters."
 I shrugged.
 "What else is a girl to do?"
 Alec's reply shrug mirrored mine exactly and yet still turned the movement into something far more graceful and eloquent than what I'd managed.
 "Be that as it may, I think you don't give yourself enough credit for just how amazing you are."
 I felt myself start to blush as Alec disappeared into the bathroom.
 ** Monsters I could handle, motorcycles were something else entirely.
 I'd almost backed out when Alec told me we'd be taking his bullet bike, but I didn't want him to know I really was a complete wuss.
 All of which explained how I'd ended up on Alec's shiny, blue Yamaha R1 with my arms locked around him in a death grip.

I was in shock as he knelt, not under his own power, and was frozen there before us.
 How could I have seen him?
 Chevelle mumbled something and my ears began to ring, distracting me from bewilderment.
 It was only a few stuttered heartbeats before recognition came.
 “Stop!” I hissed.
 All eyes turned to me, but I glared at Chevelle.
 “Stop,” I repeated.
 He understood.
 My ears ceased ringing, my hearing cleared.
 I stepped forward, the rage still fuming.

They drew their swords.
 Harruq held an arm defensively in front of Qurrah, his eyes darting in all directions.
 Slowly, the leader extended the stick, poking it against Harruq’s chest.
 The soft glow turned into a brilliant flare of emerald.
 “Elves,” the man said.
 “No doubt about it.”
 He laughed to the others and then punched Harruq in the gut.
 As the half-orc doubled over, the guard grabbed his hair and tugged.
 “Got to be a disguise,” he said.
 Another guard used the hilt of his sword to strike Harruq’s back.

But it did save our butts so I'm happy, I magically gained it.” “Well I hope I get some cool power too,” Emily said and stretched.

 Emily made a face at him.
 “Wow, thanks so much for the support, Jason.

 “You're welcome.” “One day,” she mumbled.
 “One darn day...” “Emily, are you okay?” I asked.

“Seth, I was here in my dream, the one with Kojas and the dwarf,” I said.
 His eyes widened and he looked down at the ground below, obviously trying to imagine what it had looked like.
 I had seen it and I was seriously scarred for my life.
 “You sure?” he asked.
 “You know that this means that Kojas was here, so he can’t be too far away.” “Don’t get your hopes up.
 I saw him once and I have no intention of being near him anytime soon.” He sat on the edge, the wind tossing around his hair.
 It was going to be seriously wind-blown later.
 I sat down next to him and I was trying to forget the dwarf’s mangled body.
 I shook and hugged myself.
 “Are you cold?” he asked, his voice full of concern.

Steed still played with his feather, eventually entertaining me with it.
 It spun toward me and turned down, tickling my arm and then my nose.
 I giggled despite my wariness, and reached up to rub my nose where the plume had brushed it.
 I noticed the map on my palms.
 “What about spells?” He eyed my hands.
 “Been working spells?” “Not on purpose.” He smiled.
 “Yes, spells can be dangerous.” “Yes,” I agreed, “but why do you need words for spells and not magic?” “A spell can be left, set with a trigger, or larger than your magic.
 They are complicated and wicked things.
 And the ancient language is… tricky.
 Definitely something you should stay away from.

"It'll be payment for the history lesson."
 Marie exclaimed with excitement when she saw Faneuil Hall--she'd been there many times.
 But she didn't recognize the interior at all.
 It contained all kinds of shops with jewelry, candy, and a variety of other goods that she didn't have a chance to inspect because when Rick realized that there weren't any major clothing stores here, he led her back to the car, and they drove to a huge indoor shopping area he called a mall.
 "Why don't we just buy you something comfortable for now?” he suggested as they went into the nearest store.
 “Something to wear around the house."
 He led her to the ladies’ section.
 "What size pants should we try?"
 "I have no idea."
 He took a pair of soft jeans and held them up.

Dropping into a chair, she drew her legs up and wrapped her arms around her knees.
 She wanted to go to Hollywood more than she'd ever wanted anything.
 Well, not more than she wanted to go home.
 She was having fun here, but it was as if she were on holiday.
 She missed her mother and father and friends, and she didn't think she could bear it if she thought she'd never get back.
 What if she skipped her walk in the garden today and today turned out to be her chance to get back?
 But she knew that no one in 1927 was going to take her to Hollywood.
 She smiled, remembering with pleasure the moment when Rick had said he was taking her to Hollywood.
 Her heart sped up again at just the memory.
 Hollywood!

"I had a bet with myself that you weren't going to wait.
 Somehow the fact I just lost doesn't matter now."
 It didn't seem possible he was talking to me, that anyone so gorgeous could mean something like that about me.
 I opened my mouth, maybe to laugh the comment off, or otherwise hedge my bets against the humiliation and inevitable mocking laughter.
 Whatever it was I'd intended on saying evaporated away the instant he reached out and slowly slid his finger down the side of my face.
 The tiny part of me that was still screaming none of this could be real was pulled along by the rest of me.
 I completely abandoned myself to the sensations created by his touch.
 My nerve endings didn't know whether to classify his finger as icy cold or scorching hot, but before I could recoil in pain the sensation gave way to a tingly warmth that sank down into my center, simultaneously tightening and relaxing parts I didn't even know I had.
 My pounding heart seemed loud enough to hear from across the street.
 I opened my eyes, afraid he could somehow hear the overworked muscle, already flushing red with embarrassment, only to find a gentle smile waiting for me.

The pool featured a high dive like the one at Carmen Ranch Club where Eric worked part-time as an apprentice lifeguard and trampoline instructor.
 He climbed, sprang, jackknifed and got a few cheers from spectators, including several showgirls.
 Though I had never attempted a high dive before, after some bourbon, the feat looked simple.
 Inches from the end of the board was a depression full of water, on which my foot slipped.
 I tried to stop, but too late.
 The world spun sideways then upside down before I pinched my eyes closed.
 When my head nicked the board, the day went black.
 I don’t remember falling.
 Probably the water revived me.
 As Eric helped me out, I got more cheers than he had.

Neither parent thought the other was good enough for their child, let alone the fact that they were both still children.
 Once the reason for the marriage was revealed, their parents accepted it as best as they could.
 My father’s parents arranged for them to live together in a small home while they finished school and awaited the birth of their baby.
 It was the late fifties and a pregnant teenager was an embarrassment.
 Shame followed the couple wherever they went.
 Thomas Richard was born on a cold December day to parents who were children themselves.
 I followed just 13 months later, and another brother was born 14 months later and died almost immediately after his birth.
 My mother at 20 years old had two toddlers and had to accept the death of her third baby.
 Years later, I returned to this town and located the home we first shared.
 The home, which had since been converted into a one car garage, still had the old front door located next to a single car garage door that had been put in place of what was once the front window.

The three of them stood silent for a minute.
 Finally, Doi’van spoke, “Maybe you need a connection to see the doors and the room?
 All of us worship the Celestials and we were all drawn to their sigils, especially Rodregas.
 I was drawn to the door here, which makes sense.
 This room, like the Celestial Chamber, seems to have similar beasts of the Infernal realm.
 Rodregas was also drawn to a lesser extent, which might indicate that we were right about Ravenhurr experimenting with Infernal power.
 If Ravenhurr had already included its magic in his own, then Rodregas would have it now.
 Imeralda though has no connection to the Infernal Realms and therefore is blind to it.” The three nodded slowly, caught up in the mystery of the hidden chambers.
 Imeralda said, “The need for a connection to sense the rooms would be true for the knights as well.
 We know that neither Hellborn nor Nymphs are usually allowed in.

I didn’t think I blamed him—he seemed to be involved by chance—but I hadn’t fully decided yet.
 As we rode wordlessly through the cold stone landscape, my thoughts twisted and writhed as if a pit of vipers.
 In the end, I’d decided I wasn’t really that shocked about being half-human.
 It explained so much about myself.
 Clumsiness, lack of skill, never quite fitting in.
 What took me by surprise was the betrayal I felt.
 All the years I’d lived in the village, I’d never counted on anyone the way I had done with this group, Chevelle especially.
 The feeling in my chest was so thick and heavy it burned.
 Struggling with my reactions kept me distracted from the ride.
 It was steep now, rocky, a haze hanging in the few spiky trees.

"Hmmm.
 You may have a slight fever.
 I'm going to get you some aspirin and juice."
 He watched her go.
 She was so sweet and loving.
 When she returned, he took the aspirin and drank the juice, obeying when she insisted that he lie down on the sofa so that she could bathe his face with cool water.
 Marie patted his forehead with the washcloth, dipped it into the bowl of water, wrung it out, and then patted his forehead again.
 "Maybe a good night's sleep will help ward off a cold."
 She kissed his temple.
 He took her hand, pressing his lips into her palm.

I rubbed my sore back and looked around, taking in the dead looking trees and shadows.
 “Where are we?” “I don’t know, Jazell.
 The creature must have been a setup to bring us here,” he replied.
 “I think I know who did it.” “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure that out, Seth,” I pointed out.
 I looked around.
 “Where are the others?” Seth went pale.
 “I don’t know Jazell, they aren’t here.
 They’re just gone.” My stomach twisted into a knot.
 We had always been a group of four and now it was just the two of us.
 The ghost girl’s words came back to me.

 Germany's apprenticeship programme equips nearly 70 per cent of all teenagers with employable skills before they enter the workforce.
 Two-thirds of the UK workforce have no vocational or professional qualification, compared with only 25 per cent in Germany.
 There is growing support in the United States for establishment of a national youth apprenticeship training programme that combines classroom schooling with on-the-job skills training to ensure a smooth transition to employment for those who do not pursue higher education.
 11.Link demilitarization to urban employment: The military possesses both the expertise and the physical infrastructure for training large numbers of people in a wide range of technical, vocational and social skills.
 Building upon success ful US Defence Department programmes that re-deploy soldiers to assist troubled inner city youth, closed military bases can be converted into large training centres operated by military teaching staff for instructing and housing urban unemployed youth during an apprenticeship period.
 12.Promote integrated urban development programmes: The Atlanta Project is a bold attempt to evolve a new type of organization to address the problems of inner city poverty and unemployment.
 The inner city of Atlanta, Georgia, has been divided into clusters in which members of the local community work closely with the staff of major corporations, voluntary agencies, religious groups and a wide range of government agencies to identify and promote employment opportunities and other poverty-alleviation activities.
 13.Promote organizational innovation: In recent years, large firms have made significant strides in improving their speed, efficiency and flexibility of response to changing market conditions by restructuring operations into independent companies and autonomous profit-centres.

While Marie looked around at all the lacy, sometimes colorful articles, Rick found a saleslady.
 "My friend over there, for reasons I won't go into, may not know her sizes.
 Will you help her find a couple of bras and some underwear?"
 "Of course--I'll take care of her."
 The lady could tell Marie's underwear size with no problem.
 But when Marie came out of the dressing room complaining that the 32B was too tight, she wondered how she'd missed the girl's bust size by such a margin.
 Marie found that she loved shopping for modern lingerie.
 She liked lace and rich colors and chose black, emerald, fuchsia, and royal blue underwear.
 It really didn't matter, she supposed, what her underwear looked like.
 But she couldn't wait to get home and change into her new things.

He told her that all 50 states--"Fifty!"
 she exclaimed--had Miss America representatives in a contest that was televised every year, along with a Miss Universe contest, and that evolution was taught in most schools now, alongside creation in some parts of the country.
 She told him that she'd always wanted to see Josephine Baker's stage show and Louis Armstrong and his trumpet, and he told her that anyone truly talented and/or popular now eventually did a television special.
 She told him about the excitement over the discovery of King Tut's tomb in 1922, and as she was explaining how it had inspired the Egyptian motif of her dress, she glanced around and realized how out of style she was.
 "Dresses are sometimes quite short," she observed, "but not all of them.
 And I never would have believed that women would wear trousers in public without causing a stir!"
 "You should see the bathing suits."
 "They're shorter than the dresses?"
 He laughed.
 "`Short' isn't the word.

"It's usually so awkward, even if the guy is nice.
 But I felt comfortable tonight.
 I had a good time."
 "So did I."
 Rick opened her car door.
 "If you were into racquetball, I'd invite you out for a couple of games tomorrow.
 How about tennis--do you like tennis?"
 "Afraid not.
 I'm not much of an athlete."
 "How about brunch and a movie then?"

Spanish arrived much too soon.
 Since I hadn't gotten in trouble wandering the halls so far, it was a definite temptation to skip the last hour of school too.
 Unfortunately my luck was bound to give out sooner or later, and then I'd be in even more trouble.
 The last thing I needed was a record of delinquency to go along with my failing grade in Biology.
 Mrs. Tiggs was positively glowing as we all walked into her classroom.
 She popped out of her chair as soon as the bell rang, and began handing out graded tests.
 My world started trembling as I turned my test over and saw an 'F' at the top of the page.
 'Come see me after class.'
 The note felt like the final nail in the coffin of my academic future.
 My efforts to focus were entirely wasted.

"A little.
 I didn't get much sleep last night.
 But I'd rather talk."
 "All right."
 Arm in arm they returned to the living room and sat on the sofa.
 "Can you tell me anything about what happened, darling?
 If you were hurt or starved?"
 Marie sighed, wishing she could tell her mother everything.
 But she'd think that Marie had been so traumatized that she'd lost her grip on reality.
 "I wasn't hurt or starved.

Infant mortality is rising in many of the countries.
 Not surprisingly, there have been increasing indications of public discontent and voter dissatisfaction with the course of the reforms in the vast majority of countries.
 Simultaneous Shocks
 The collapse of the East European and Central Asian economies from 1990 to 1994 resulted from their exposure to a series of simultaneous shocks.
 1.Stabilization and adjustments: The majority of countries, having suffered from inflation and balance of payments problems in the 1980s, applied sharp stabilization and adjustment programmes in the early 1990s to stop inflation, balance budgets, and close balance of payments gaps, while at the same time liberalizing prices in order to correct major price distortions.
 These deflationary policies led, in most cases, to sharp declines in output.
 2.Resource allocation: Sudden dismantling of the central planning machinery responsible for the allocation of materials for current production and allocation of funds and materials for investment in these countries was another shock.
 It proved impossible in the majority of countries to create and organize, overnight, commodity and financial markets of sufficient depth and flexibility to substitute effectively for the planning machinery.
 3.Import liberalization: Drastic import liberalization led to the inflow of better-quality, lower-priced foreign goods that depressed demand for domestically produced goods.
 The shock impact of imports was aggravated by the fact that farmers in the region were forced to compete in some cases with subsidized agricultural products from the West.

She couldn't possibly be that scared about me putting two and two together if he'd been saying nice things about me.
 He hated me, and she was scared of him, scared of what he'd do if he found out she'd let his secret slip.
 "It's not like that, Adri.
 It's..." I didn't even have to cut her off.
 She couldn't finish her own thought, couldn't come up with a lie that was believable.
 I shook my head and went back to my desk before my invulnerability wore off and she brought on another attack.
 I missed them both so badly.
 Dad had always been there to listen when I got into problems like this.
 He'd known how to deal with the world, how to work with circumstances so that what resulted was beneficial, or at least something I could live with.
 And Cindi.

As Thanksgiving approached, our traditions looked impossible to pull off.
 We were evasive when we called my wife’s parents to tell them not to come to our house as they usually did.
 We said we had some personal family issues to deal with.
 We could tell their feelings were hurt, but we didn’t feel we had any other choice.
 We did allow my younger brother Harry in on the whole awful situation and invited him to come to the house as planned.
 I needed my younger brother because he had developed a great relationship with my boys.
 He’s 11 years younger than me, and in the music business where he works shooting videos for rap artists my sons listen to.
 He has had a solid relationship with both of our boys and that could translate into communication.
 This Thanksgiving we had an agenda that didn’t include turkey and all the trimmings.
 Agenda Item One: Get our son’s belongings out of his rental house.

Chapter 10
 Emily and Jason dashed back to our sides as the shadow became a body.
 It was bigger than the dragon we had rode.
 It had the body of a huge cockroach but its tail was a giant stinger.
 Large, bat wings were holding it up in the air.
 “What is it?” I asked.
 I turned to Emily and said, “Emily, you know anything about this creature?” She looked pale.
 “It's saying, 'Kill half-lings, kill and eat.
 '“ “Well, you better tell it that it's going to have to starve this time because it's not going to be eating anything,” Seth said confidently and held his sword out.
 She shook her head.

He should have shown it to Marie before he’d fallen in love with her.
 But he was afraid to tell her he’d known of her before she’d walked into the garden.
 What if she thought he’d done something to cause it?
 Marie was growing increasingly frustrated with the books she was reading.
 There were all kinds of theories about how to travel through time, but there was absolutely nothing that could explain how she’d traveled through time.
 She hadn’t gotten in a time machine, hadn’t been near a dead star, hadn’t been thinking about 2011.
 That was another thing—most of the articles talked about traveling back in time, not forward.
 How could she have been thinking about 2011 when she knew nothing about it?
 She picked up a book with a chapter on traveling through time by thought.
 Like most of the others, it was about traveling backwards, so it couldn’t explain how she got here, but now she was trying to travel backwards.

Jim – The best kind to adopt when you’re dealing with Johnny.
 Cleo – What do you mean by that?
 Jim – I mean that he’ll be back when he’s ready to come back.
 Art – Perhaps instead we should go and see if we can get some more information about the fire, it should have made the news by now.
 Eugene – It’s not like anything else goes on here for the stations to report.
 Cleo – I’ll bet that those sorrow peddlers are overjoyed for a fire on Thanksgiving.
 Finale
 Jim is sitting alone in the basement reading his comic.
 Art, Liz and Eugene enter in a rather downcast and upset manner.

In fact, I don't think I'll ever forget the expression on Jasmin's face when he told her she could go clubbing all she wanted after he judged her suitably proficient in real dancing.
 He said he wouldn't have her 'seduced by throbbing beats and soulless contact' before he'd at least exposed her to proper dance steps."
 I felt a giggle surge past my lips, and pressed them tight before I could completely embarrass myself.
 "That's amazing.
 My dad thought knowing how to dance would make my first dance easier.
 It turned out to be a complete waste of time.
 Nobody asked me to dance and his lessons wouldn't have helped even if they had.
 Still, now I wish I'd done a better job of learning."
 Alec nodded, but there was a distracted air to the gesture.
 I waited while we made another quarter of a journey, him gracefully, me not quite so much, around the floor, before opening my mouth to speak, but he beat me to it.

Jeremiah knew then he would enter the golden eternity before the dawn.
 Someone swung a torch while another man thrust his short sword.
 The half-orc shattered the sword with a savage swipe while ignoring the torch as it smashed across his leather armor.
 He roared as he chopped that man’s head into pieces.
 The dropped torch sputtered and died.
 All the courage he could muster failed to move Jeremiah forward.
 He watched the raging warrior butcher friend after friend, so many having never seen their eighteenth winter.
 Harruq tore a neck open, punctured the same man three times, and then gutted another who had closed the distance.
 The man died after his final slash passed an inch from the half-orc’s skin.
 “Come on,” Jeremiah said to himself.

 "Why didn't you just call?"
 "It's too important for that."
 He took her hand, gazing into her eyes as he raised it to his lips.
 "Let's go inside."
 They sat down on the sofa, and Rick held both her hands in his as he faced her.
 "I love you, Marie.
 I love you more than I've ever loved anyone in my life.

It wasn't until I felt the iron-hard muscles under my now-tingling hand that I realized what I'd done.
 I felt a surge of heat wash over my face and neck.
 Brandon for once didn't have an easy comeback to defuse the awkwardness.
 If anything he looked slightly uncomfortable himself.
 "I'm sure it's nothing important..." He trailed off as my traitorous hand found his arm of its own accord and started pulling again.
 I wasn't sure why I was so anxious; usually I avoided crowds like the plague.
 Maybe I was just trying to prolong our time together.
 I let go as soon as we reached the fringe of the crowd, and prayed it was only my imagination that made me think Brandon was just the slightest bit relieved.
 Luckily there was plenty to distract me.
 It looked like there'd been some kind of war behind the school.

That was a weird night, because, well, we didn’t really fit it.
 This was the beginning of prog rock—sort of, it wasn’t really time, yet--and these guys, they were out there, I mean, beautiful cats, and Henry Cow had that guy--Frith—what was his name?—weird cat, and, well, they were all Moog Synths and Synclaviers and violins and even marimbas, and, hell, we were just this heavy guitar oriented trio, you know?
 It was an odd marriage that didn’t really work.
 And I think the crowd was there to see us, because, you know, who the hell were these foreigners with their off-the-wall songs and instrumentation?
 And even though a lot was tolerated back then—I mean, Jesus, everyone had to have their 15 minute drum solo—every fucking concert, every fucking group—the crowd didn’t warm to Gentle Giant—which was (is) a really tight combo, playing some farout stuff.
 I think later, they returned to Memphis and played the Coliseum in front of Tull,  and went down a lot better.
 Anyway, we started hearing this, you blew them off the stage and shit like that.
 But, you know, all that competitive stuff, that’s just for the media.
 The groups don’t do that shit.
 You know, you don’t go out on stage and say, I’m gonna make their guitarist look silly.

 We could hear him approaching the bedroom as the volume of his voice increased.
 We watched through the slats in the closet door as he would open her dresser drawers and rummage through her belongings, including her undergarments, while looking around over his shoulder, still yelling her name.
 Eventually, he would leave and somehow mom would come up with the rent to keep a roof over our heads for another month.
 We were getting old enough to know that we were different than most families in many ways, but we always knew we had a loving mother.
 Thomas and I also knew that the only other consistent thing in our life was each other.
 We were very close in size and we were often mistaken as twins although I had blond hair and he had brown.

But even in consort, they don’t explain why we ought to do good or why we should avoid sin.
 We could infer we should do it because God said so, but to some of us, that answer feels unworthy.
 Pastor Ed Noble suggested an answer that rings more complete.
 The word translated "the right thing" or “the good” or what we “ought to do” is the Greek kalos in the accusative case, more naturally translated as "beautiful".
 So what we ought to seek is "the beautiful" or "to do the beautiful".
 One reason I would rather seek the beautiful than the good is because I can know with more confidence when I have encountered it.
 When I first read the John Keats poem, “Ode on a Grecian Urn” I got both enthralled and challenged by the lines “Beauty is truth, truth beauty.
 That is all we know on earth and all we need to know.” I believe those words are inspired, expressing deep though mysterious wisdom.
 Bible translators may avoid the word "beauty" because too many readers might interpret in ways akin to the ’60s motto, “If it feels good, do it.” In my vocabulary, "beautiful" describes a harmony that suggests the eternal.
 Such beauty may harbor sadness, or even a terrifying dread.

"You'll need to pick out an empty table, we don't let students share here.
 Also I'd recommend choosing one somewhat distant from Ms. Samuels, she doesn't need any more distractions than she already has.
 When you have a question, or need help from one of the tutors, flip the card over to the red side and place it on your desk."
 I nodded and headed over to a table near the girl, one where I could watch her without her seeing me.
 I wasn't going to fall all over myself to become her friend or anything, but I figured it was worth observing her for a little bit.
 If she really was cool then we might strike up a friendship at some point.
 If she wasn't, then the sooner I could confirm that fact the better off I'd be.
 I pulled out my book, study guide, and some paper, and got busy with my next self-assigned homework set.
 I was up to graphing now, which was about as straightforward as you could get.
 I made pretty good progress, pausing from time to time to stretch my neck and look around.

She was young, barely more than a girl, and not a trained warrior.
 She was also much more fragile than either Doi’van or Rodregas; a blow that would only stun the two of them would shatter her.
 Her incredible magic power would do her little good in a stand up battle.
 For all of that she gave a nod; she was willing to follow his lead.
 If he wanted to attack, she would follow them.
 How could someone so young and inexperienced be so brave?
 How could he not honor such bravery?
 Rodregas looked into Imeralda’s eyes.
 She had been watching him.
 There was no need for words, no argument.

But, with few exceptions, they were founded on the same general principles and on the policy recommendations of Western proponents of rapid transformation to total free-market liberal capitalism, based on a simultaneous shock strategy encompassing macro-economic stabilization, prices and property rights.
 Western governments and the international financial institutions, led by the IMF, strongly advocated this approach and linked financial assistance to its adoption.
 The strategy called for rapid deregulation of prices, privatization of farms and industry, introduction of a convertible currency, and balancing the budget to reduce the high fiscal deficits, primarily by reducing military expenditure and subsidies to producers and consumers.
 The assumption was that a programme with these elements would result in a significant increase in production, efficiency and the availability of consumer goods within a short time.
 The actual results were quite contrary to the expectations of these countries’ Western economic advisers, as well as to the governments and people of the region.
 The initial phase of reforms had a disastrous impact on the economies, on the people and in some countries on peace and political stability.
 From 1990 to 1993 production in all 25 nations declined drastically, from a minimum of 10 per cent in Poland, 20 percent in Hungary and 22 per cent in the Czech Republic to a maximum of 45 per cent in Russia, 57 per cent in Latvia and 75 per cent in Armenia.
 Investment fell by an average rate of 13 –14 per cent per year from 1990 to 1992, and by a three-year total of more than 50 per cent in Russia.
 The fall in real incomes followed that of output, and the impact was made even more severe, especially for pensioners, by the simultaneous dismantling of the vast social support system and dramatic increase in the cost of essential consumer goods.
 The drastic decline in living standards for the vast majority has been accompanied by the emergence of a new class of instantaneous millionaires, some on the basis of their ability in combining factors of production in new circumstances and others due to hoarding of goods under inflation, loopholes in newly enacted legislation on privatization, and personal influence with those in power.

 It is looking like this deal is not going to happen either.
 I answer some of the calls and ignore others as I am instructed to do by Officer White.
 I whisper in one call as if I can’t talk because I am still stuck at home with my wife and cannot talk freely.
 I reassure Ashley that I will meet her as soon as I can get out.
 I think of my wife and son at home wondering why I haven’t called; is it over?
 Am I dead?
 Finally the crew is all present behind the store, and the review of protocol and procedure began as it did before.
 New officers are in amongst familiar faces from the prior attempt.
 I find myself less interested in their chat as I mentally prepare myself for the task at hand.

It seemed no hand could touch this one, the horse possessing dexterity beyond what any creature that size should have.
 Velixar showed no sign of being aware of their approach.
 His eyes had rolled back into his head as he controlled the multitude of magical hands.
 “Be gone,” Qurrah said, firing several pieces of bone.
 All pieces missed.
 He tried to cast another hemorrhage spell but the words felt heavy and drunk on his tongue.
 His mind ached, his chest heaved, and when the spell finished it created nothing but a wound the size of an arrowhead in the side of Sonowin.
 “Master, defend yourself!” Qurrah shouted as loud as he could.
 Still nothing.
 More and more hands curled in, surrounding Dieredon and Sonowin in a magical maelstrom, yet still they came.

 She blushed just thinking about how they made her feel.
 He kissed her lips softly.
 "Do you know what my life was like before you came?
 I'd dated half the women in Boston, I think, trying to find one that I wanted to spend my life with.
 I was really lonely, but I'd just about given up.
 It just wasn't worth the effort."
 He squeezed her hands.
 "And then you walked into my garden.

They are essentially synthetic heroin, and much sought after by the drug addicts who litter your streets, work alongside you and perhaps sit next to you at a family dinner.
 They are daughters or sons or parents.
 The street price for these pills could reach up to $80 each while the co-pay at the pharmacy for the insured who are prescribed these pills could be as little as $10 for a quantity of ninety.
 That is quite a tidy profit for all involved, and the sellers do not care what casualties wait.
 That is about all that stays the same in the drug world decade after decade.
 The pill commonly referred to by the street name “Oxy” does not get swallowed by addicts in the way the pharmaceutical companies intended.
 To intensify the effect of the drug, they consume the pills in alternative ways: First, they remove the time release coating that covers the pill by either scrapping it off with their fingernail or using a wet paper towel.
 Then, they crush the tablet into a powder and snort it.
 When snorting the Oxy begins to clog up and destroy their noses, or just isn’t getting them high enough, the addict places the pill whole, without the coating, onto a small square of aluminum foil, and holds a lighter underneath.
 The addict rolls the pill around the foil in an odd balancing act so as not to lose the pill off the edge of the hot foil, or to leave it in one hot spot too long.

Over acting the part he’s doing with all his heart.
 Dressed in casual clothes that one might wear around the house Saturday morning.
 Various pieces of living room furniture sit about the stage.
 Character 1- And what doth the ravens say to my ear whilst I sleep.
 And the cows do moo and the Asses bray.
 Yet as I dance in the rain and do weep, Yonder figure turns to walk away.
 (speaks directly to the audience)What say you my good dear man?
 Dost the line and verse drive one to the ends of emotional rationality?
 Yes as I did think, and so I thought.
 For like a duck walking backwards into a frozen stump, so does the muse speak her inspiration to the heart of the play-write… and as the muse speaks it, so do I perform it.

His large frame stalked through the grass, eager for the hunt to begin.
 The great Lion twitched his ears to the right.
 He had expected his nemesis, the White Stag, but instead walked a woman.
 Her long legs somehow managed to keep pace with him.
 Her hair, as golden as his own fur, rained down her curved back; she wore a glowing short white shift adorned with many pouches.
 “Why do you hunt with me, Goddess?” The Lion growled.
 The Goddess Blodeuwedd answered, “I am proud of you.
 I will be truthful, I shared my favor with you simply as a matter of convenience.
 I hoped you might succeed.
 I did not think you would live, much less add to your power and gather more hunters to our pride.” The great Lion shook his head, the ways of the winds and the speech of gods were the same, fickle and not to be truly understood.

The half-orc laughed.
 “Mother was an orc who had lived here in Woodhaven.
 I do not know her name, other than what she instructed my brother and I to call her: Mama Tun.
 Our father was from Woodhaven, she told us.
 We later found out he was an elf, bizarre as it seems.”
 “It is a wretched elf who would mate with an orc,” Velixar said.
 “No true elf would,” Qurrah said.
 “This means he was weak to have done so.
 His weakness has seeped into my blood.”
 “You hold no weakness,” the man in black said.

I do not want to fail him.
 That is all that matters.
 We must not fail.”
 Aurelia had heard enough.
 She knew their roles, the balance and position of their hearts.
 It was absurd, poor souls without a home, family, or position to be speaking of power and obligation.
 Her hatred of their unknown master grew.
 He was a puppet-master, and her dear friend was one of his puppets.
 If they still doubted, even for a moment, perhaps she could save them.
 Perhaps there was still time to pull them from the necromancer’s cold fingers.

Anyone with that many muscles was at least a little threatening.
 But he was just sitting there casually, driving along, seemingly without a care in the world.
 In fact, he wasn't buckled in either.
 "Isn't that a bit hypocritical?
 I mean you tell her to buckle up, but you're not buckled up yourself."
 Alec shrugged.
 "Yes, I suppose it does look hypocritical at that.
 Let's just say Rachel would be missed if we hit another car, but nobody would need to miss me."
 The answer was like something you'd expect from a politician.
 It conveyed absolutely no information, and his supreme confidence was infuriating.

 It was what we were made for.
 What other purpose do you see for your life?”
 Harruq shrugged.
 “I said it before.

 “Then kill those that seek to kill me,” Qurrah said, a bit of his sleepiness leaving him.
 “Our master has given us so much.

 I hate that.
 I hate that I sing a song and then they come in and lay some harpsichord or Jew’s harp or whatever behind it.
 But, that’s the times, man, I gotta go with the times.
 Still, I insist on a certain honesty, a certain interplay in the studio, and this places me solidly on the outside.
 A pain in the ass, that’s what these label guys think I am.

He shook his head, and a bit of sadness crossed his face.
 “We have been forbidden.
 Ceredon insists this is a minor skirmish, nothing more.

 You’re the one who said he was dangerous, that he might be…”
 Another communal roar, even closer.

But to adore the creator of that feeling, God for creating nature, a lover for giving me a piece of her heart, or parents for providing warmth and safety, that is appreciation, gratitude, untainted by the selfishness that all sin is made of.
 Maybe if I practice this exercise, try to catch myself in each act of admiration, and turn my worship to the creator, I will gradually learn to adore God the father, and God the spirit.
 But for now, my thoughts drift back to Eric.
 I have tried, on this trip, to relive our whole two years of brotherhood.
 And now I reconsider the fact that he didn’t die the moment his head rammed the boulder.
 He lived for a day, during which we got confronted with the possibility that drove my story “Cars”, that he might live another sixty years without the use of his marvelous brain.
 Or, a miracle might bring him back to life.
 A whole new question arises.
 What if, while Eric lay comatose, he was given once more the choice to live, as I'm coming to believe he was given the choice before leaving for the desert in Kenny’s mom’s Volkswagen?
 If Kenny were still alive, I would ask him to describe, as best his memory would serve him, Eric’s expression and voice when he insisted they leave without Billy and me.

It was bad enough not fitting in because you preferred your own company over that of your peers.
 It sucked a lot more when you didn't have a choice.
 I tried to amuse myself by people-watching with the half of my mind that wasn't paying attention to Britney's chatter as we went back to our lockers.
 We passed one of those gorgeous, skinny redheads who always look good without looking like they spent much time in front of the mirror, then Britney exchanged smiles with a couple of artificial blondes.
 I'd seen the type before in Minnesota, girls who have a perfectly acceptable figure, but who throw money into their wardrobes, makeovers and accessories in an effort to achieve the cutting-edge look, when they'd be much better off just picking outfits that didn't try to compete with the anorexic-looking beauty queens.
 A surprisingly adorable-looking nerd in jeans and a tee-shirt ducked out of our way, and I felt a pang of sympathy.
 He was the kind of boy Mom pointed out when she surfaced from one of her projects.
 She hadn't ever managed to really pique my interest in any boy, but I could see how a few years from now, he'd probably be fairly popular among college girls.
 Britney stopped before one of the top lockers and started spinning the tumbler.
 She was still relating some story about her old school, but suddenly I couldn't hear a word.

If you pull away before it is done, you will mess up the pattern and it will use up your magic without adding the benefits of the sigil.” As Jordaan finished speaking he looked in Rodregas’ eyes until he nodded his understanding.
 He knew what was coming.
 He could feel Jordaan’s magic start to pour into his hands and into the frog.
 A sensation emanating from the frog began to fill his senses.
 Without Rodregas’ conscious will, his own magic raised from the core of his being.
 The two magic forces seemed to mix and then enter the frog.
 They seemed to pour from the frog back into his own body.
 That power felt like a thousand small knives digging into his flesh.
 His body tightened and he could feel Jordaan’s hands hold him firm.
 Rodregas struggled to keep his arm from spasming in pain.

Although the next step was slamming or injecting in his veins, he hadn’t gone that far.
 He was up to about thirty Oxy pills a day and couldn’t sell enough to supply his habit.
 While he had been living on less since his home lock-down, he was really never clean during this detox.
 How was Brandon going to achieve what these cops wanted in his condition and with his new reputation as a snitch?
 I am the father, with all that that means.
 I am the man of the family, and I would do anything to protect my family but I was in unchartered territory here once again.
 What would Dino NOT do?
 What would Richard NOT do?
 I looked the undercover narcotics officer in the face and blurted, “I’ll do the bust!” I’m raising my freaking hand like I am volunteering to coach a soccer team.
 I believe firmly that the deal to bust Steve should be forgiven due to the failure on the part of the police and the complete and total fiasco that had come from the officers not doing their homework and giving Brandon the same number that Steve already knew was an undercover cop’s phone.

I rolled on my side toward her, dimly irritated she’d poisoned me again.
 Though it was much less severe this time.
 I was simply enveloped in tranquility.
 “Ruby…” Her curls had tumbled back and my complaint fell short as I was distracted by her ears.
 “Hmm?” she answered.
 I reached up to feel my own ears as I considered hers.
 I had always hidden mine behind hair, never braiding it back or putting it up to expose them.
 Not that I could have pulled off the intricate braiding and designs of the other elves.
 But my ears were clearly more rounded than everyone else’s, almost blunt.
 Ruby’s were different, too.

“He mentioned Ravenhurr as a concern.” “But, he simply went mad.
 That is not uncommon,” she said with a voice laced with surprise.
 “Actually,” said Van’dret, “it is very rare for a Master of Ravenhurr’s level to go mad.
 I am not sure if you ever met him, but he was good, very good.” “Then in that case we had better all keep our eyes open.” She said.
 CHAPTER 7 A TIME TO PREPARE
 Rodregas woke up first, at dawn.
 He stayed in his bed just thinking and reviewing all that he had gone through in the last few days; it was a lot to adjust to.
 When the others got up they ate some of the supplies, including the last of the fresh bread.
 They had plenty of cheese and, at the moment, an endless supply of apples.
 Rodregas had an idea about how he wanted to start this new day.

You all wouldn't have been so worried about Alec bringing me home Friday night if this was all no big deal.
 None of you have argued with Alec about anything since then, but Friday night James, Jasmin and Jessica were all ready to rip my head off over his express orders."
 The nod I received this time was even slower than the first.
 I waited for Isaac to say something, but he seemed unwilling to give away anything I hadn't already figured out for myself.
 "Can he win?
 Alec, I mean.
 Can he ki...beat Brandon?"
 Isaac's sigh was eloquent.
 "I'm forbidden to speak on these things.
 To do so risks no small amount of Alec's displeasure."

A great evil has left this land.
 Let us return to Woodhaven, for this place of death turns my mouth sour.”
 The two took to the air and joined the other survivors.
 They did not try to locate their dead among the hundreds of other rotting bodies.
 Instead, a few elves flew low and scattered firestones, small pebbles that burst into flame upon landing.
 Grass and bodies ignited, and the battlefield rapidly swelled into a giant funeral pyre.
 Qurrah crawled out from underneath the body as flames erupted all around him.
 Everywhere he looked, he saw embers and corpses.
 He spotted the robes of Velixar and ran to them.
 He picked them up and shook them, furious that no body remained.

For a second I couldn't even think.
 He'd just used the 'L-word', and my heart felt like it was tearing itself apart inside my chest.
 In the subtle shadings we girls used to measure commitment, it wasn't as good as if he'd come right out and said, 'I love you Adriana Paige', but it was still pretty good, and it was a complete first for me.
 Once I made it past the second part of his statement, I was able to start considering the first part of what he'd said.
 It was horrifying and amazing all at once, and it made complete sense.
 His mom was living in memories because the real world was just a pale shadow of her life with his father.
 Alec seemed to take my silence as condemnation, or possibly just agreement with his self-condemnation.
 "We're where the legends of succubi originated.
 Irresistible demons who drain their victims dry, who leave their lovers a hollow shell of what they were before."
 I'd finally worked through things enough inside my mind, to respond, but he bulldozed right over me.

 He screwed it into a lamp in the living room.
 When he turned it on, she clapped her hands.
 "It's beautiful!"
 He laughed.
 "I'm going to go make dinner while you amuse yourself."
 "Don't use the microwave without me!"
 After dinner they spent the evening watching TV.
 For Rick, it was almost like watching TV with a child: Marie had questions about everything.
 It was fun to watch the wonder on her face and the avid attention she gave the programs.

Well, I did have “two birds in the hand” and it was Valentine’s Day so I managed to do with what I had and I just needed to find a way to track my future wife down .
 .
 .
 later.
 I did talk to my mother the next morning and told her that I had met the woman I was going to marry—and it wasn’t either of the two brunettes in my bed.
 Gimme a break, it was the eighties!
 The bartender made a call for me to his girlfriend in an attempt to get my dream girl’s number.
 I knew it wouldn’t be easy because as it turns out she knew of me through high school and my reputation preceded me.
 Would this “good girl” give her number to a “bad boy?” The ploy worked and somehow Lisa agreed to let me call her.
 Lisa had been dating a guy for years and I knew of him.

Chevelle nodded at my hand and I held it out, palm up.
 Chevelle indicated a spot on one of the mountains.
 “We are here.” I tried not to let my disappointment show.
 The information would’ve only helped if I’d known where I started on the map or its endpoint.
 But at least I knew we were closer.
 When we came through the pass our path widened, but the horses didn’t separate as I had expected them to.
 I decided I’d had enough of that.
 “How do I control Steed?” I could see the humor in his eyes at my phrasing, but he kept a straight face.
 “Think of where you want him to go and lead his head so.” I concentrated on turning left and we were instantly spinning, the unexpected twirl throwing me half from my saddle.
 Chevelle caught my arm and righted me on my now-still horse.

If he’s butchering the children, he’s doing it for someone else.”
 “Who?” Dieredon asked.
 She shrugged.
 “My guess is his brother.
 He sounds like a necromancer.”
 Dieredon nodded.
 “I’ll find him and watch him for a bit.
 If either of them slaughters another child, I will see it and put an end to it.”

BG: 	The question always comes back to Bob, doesn’t it?
 Dylan is Dylan, immutable, untouchable.
 But, I think, if you asked him if he was T. S. Eliot, he would only laugh.
 What was that funny thing he said?
 “I’m only a song and dance man.” (laughs)  That’s right.
 That’s what he should say.
 CM: 	Someone called “A Day in the Life” a miniature “Waste Land.”
 BG:  	That’s caca, isn’t it?
 I mean, c’mon.
 Have you read “The Waste Land?”  Jesus.

I wish we could, for Rachel's sake as well as yours, but it's just too risky.
 Fewer witnesses means more chance Brandon's people will try to arrange for something to happen.
 There are just too many of them for us to meet them in a stand-up fight and come out unscathed."
 I didn't like it.
 Mrs. Campbell was the only teacher who'd taken an active interest in my wellbeing, but I could see his point.
 I managed to do at least a passable job hiding my near frown as I nodded in acceptance.
 "Can I have just a few minutes today after school to tell her?"
 Alec's hand was warm on my face as he nodded.
 "You're amazing.
 All the things being taken away from you just because you got involved with the wrong crowd, and you just do what has to be done.

“He’s dead, Qurrah,” the half-orc shouted.
 His deep voice, like a bear’s growl, seemed right at home in the forest.
 “Come on over.”
 Qurrah approached through the trees, clutching a worn bag in his long fingers.
 His brown eyes glanced over the dead boy.
 He nodded in approval.
 “Well done,” Qurrah said.
 “Killing kids is hardly worth a well done.”
 Qurrah frowned as he glanced from his prize to his brother, who sat against a tree, arms on his knees.
 “Take pride in all you do,” Qurrah said.

Luckily that idealistic, stupid part of me had seen too many girls get used by smooth-talking boys.
 I interrupted right away.
 "You mean when your sister nearly got beaten by that whore, and you not only didn't do anything, you stopped your friends from doing anything either."
 Alec flinched a little.
 I was a little surprised by how satisfying it was to have him, a demigod, on the run, but I didn't let it slow me down.
 "The fact that I, a little waif from out of town, could defuse the situation and save Rachel no doubt sticks in your craw, which explains why you're lurking around out here waiting to talk to me.
 Because only then can you fabricate some reason for why everything had to go down the way it did, and thereby save face!"
 He wasn't flinching now.
 Instead his face had gotten tight and remote.
 For a second it seemed like he was looking right through me.

Antonil struggled to his feet, shaking his head all the while.
 “It keeps getting stranger,” he muttered.
 He took a step and immediately regretted it.
 As his leg throbbed, he yanked the arrow out.
 His armor had kept it from penetrating too deeply, the barbs unable to latch onto any soft flesh.
 Of course it still hurt like the abyss, but he could deal with that.
 What he could not deal with, however, was how few in number his soldiers had become.
 More than four of his own men lay dead around him, joined by three dead elves, five if he counted the two the half-orc had thrown through the doorway.
 A good ratio considering the skill of the elves, but not good enough.
 Men he had trained were dying, and for what?

“It could all be an act,” Dieredon ventured.
 “Or just a side of his personality.
 Perhaps you see the elf in him.
 There are multiple sides to all men, for only the insane and the dull contain just one facet to their being.
 It could be Harruq’s orcish side that pushes him to kill the children.”
 She nodded at the possibility.
 “I will defer to your wisdom.
 The more time I spend with him, the more I wonder.
 What about you?

"How have you been, darling?"
 Marie gaped at him.
 How had she been?
 That was all he could say to her when he hadn't seen her for the past five weeks?
 "Fine, Davis.
 I've been fine."
 Freeing her hand, she moved away from him and retrieved her tea.
 The warm family atmosphere was suddenly replaced by an awkwardness that was only relieved by a lively business discussion among the three men.
 Marie caught her mother's glance, and the two ladies went to the kitchen to get some pastries and coffee.
 "Don't worry, Marie--the two of you just need some time alone together to talk."

“Me too,” Billy said.
 She shook her head.
 “You probably think I could keep Eric and Kenny in school, but here’s the way things are.
 Once the police get involved, the school board has to expel.
 That’s policy.
 Otherwise, they won’t usually expel, for fear a parent will sue them.
 “Eric and Kenny are good boys, I know.
 If I can do anything for them, I will.
 Now, you two, please go learn something.”

She continued to shoot us nasty looks throughout the class, but I hardly noticed.
 Alec spent the rest of the class time writing questions for me in the margins of my notebook.
 By the time I'd described my grandparents, kindergarten teacher, and top three most embarrassing moments, I wanted to get a chance to ask some questions of my own, but he just shook his head and passed me my notebook back with a new set of quickly-jotted queries.
 The sentences should have been a careless mess based on the speed with which he was writing.
 Instead they turned out more even and carefully constructed than anything I'd ever been able to accomplish.
 I'm the Alpha here; you can ask your questions when I finish with mine.
 The flippant, humorous nature of his response was so atypical, and yet still quintessentially Alec.
 I nearly broke into a fit of laughter that would've gotten us both in even more trouble with Mrs. Sorenson.
 I roll my eyes at you...a lot.
 So once you're done, I get to ask you any question?

Could we do something else?
 Will you show me how to use the washing machine?"
 After they'd put in a load of clothes, they had some ice cream and then returned to the living room to read.
 Rick had gotten her the Dragonriders of Pern series, since those books were about a world that was new to all readers and had very few offensive elements.
 She'd wanted some romances, but he was afraid that they'd be too explicit for her.
 And, fortunately, she'd found that she loved the Pern books.
 She was almost finished with the second one.
 Rick had just risen to make them some tea when the phone rang.
 “Hello?” he said, carrying the phone into the kitchen.
 “Hi, Rick.

He glanced at her.
 "I just wish I was the one you wanted most."
 She caught her breath, covering her mouth with her hand and running from the room.
 Rick hated himself for pushing her like that, but he couldn't seem to help it.
 He was desperate.
 He knew now that he could keep her here, but how could he do that when she wanted so much to go home?
 He ordered Chinese, and Marie came down just after it arrived.
 She saw the cartons and silently went to pour two glasses of tea.
 Rick slid his arms around her from behind.
 "I love you."

He glanced at her left hand.
 She'd taken off her engagement ring yesterday before they'd left for the shore, and she hadn't put it back on last night.
 She wasn't wearing it this morning, either.
 He wondered if she realized it but decided not to ask her.
 Setting his cup down, he said, "How would you like another new experience?"
 She smiled in delight.
 "What?"
 "Washing my car."
 Her face fell.
 "I could do that in 1927."

"Thank you."
 Alec shrugged and gave me another smile.
 "You must have driven your parents crazy with that refusal to back down."
 "I suppose I might have frustrated them a time or two."
 "And to think Rachel says I'm stubborn."
 I started to smile, but stopped as he cocked his head to the side in what was unmistakably a listening posture.
 "What's the matter?
 What do you hear?"
 "Jasmin just left."
 "What's wrong with that?"

In many developing countries the military can assist with efforts to improve social services in rural areas on a war footing – to spread literacy, primary education, basic vocational skills, health care and access to safe drinking water.
 The military have at their disposal scientific and technological resources which in many cases can be applied to environmental protection with the minimum of adaptation, such as information and monitoring systems that track changes in the atmosphere, in the oceans and on earth’s surface.
 These resources can be applied to environmental monitoring and impact assessment, protection of endangered species, quick response to disasters and accidents, energy conservation, and the minimization and management of waste.
 The appropriate role for the military in these various activities will depend on the country, the urgency of the circumstances, and the cost-effectiveness of military involvement compared with available alternatives.
 In some instances, it may be feasible to establish international ‘Earth corps units’, specially trained and equipped to carry out certain types of environmental protection and restoration, such as India’s eco-battalions, which seek to conserve the Himalayan habitat by restoring tree cover and constructing small dams and canals.
 International development force
 The goals of peace, prosperity and fulfilment for every human being represent formidable challenges – intellectual, attitudinal, organizational and technological.
 We cannot hope to reach such lofty achievements if we waste and squander the precious and abundant resources – mental, psychological, social and material – placed at our disposal.
 A massive reduction in emphasis on weapons production and military establishments, made possible by recent political events and demanded by the pressing unmet needs of people everywhere, represents both a great opportunity and a considerable challenge.
 The opportunity is not only further to reduce the threat of war by reducing the capacity for waging war, but also to redirect and utilize for other purposes the resources now dedicated to war making and prevention.

The old shape shifter always moved gingerly thanks to old injuries that had left his right leg permanently crippled.
 I hadn't thought anything of it at the time but Donovan was looking frailer lately.
 The thought of Donovan getting to the point that his age was starting to show nearly made me choke up.
 I didn't have the extensive history with Donovan that Alec's family had, but he'd been unfailingly kind to me despite the fact that I'd endangered everything he cared about.
 Alec correctly read my thoughts.
 "Don't worry; I'm sure it's nothing.
 I'll force him to take a couple of days off and I'm sure he'll be fine.
 He's only a bit past middle age for one of us."
 I nearly protested, but Alec was right, it would take an actual order to get Donovan to slow down, and two days was probably pushing it.
 Donovan somehow managed to respectfully circumvent any order he thought prevented him from taking adequate care of Alec's family.

This should be the highest priority of every Western government today.
 1.Promote small businesses: All the publicity given to the impact of down-sizing by major corporations has obscured the fact that the top 500 US firms employ less than five per cent of the US workforce.
 It is also the smaller firms that are responsible for job growth.
 Businesses employing fewer than 20 workers presently account for 57 per cent of new job creation in Europe.
 Based upon the successful examples of many developing countries that have stimulated growth in this sector, there is vast scope for expanding services to support new enterprises through better access to management and employee training courses, credit and R & D facilities; by testing and certification for those who want to start businesses; and by estab lishing business incubators to provide work space and shared services as well as technical, financial and marketing expertise to start-up companies.
 2.Reduce business failures: New businesses create most of the jobs, but they destroy most of them too, by going out of business.
 The failure rate of new businesses is extremely high in most industrial nations.
 In Italy, roughly 50 per cent fail in the first year.
 Of the more than 600,000 new business start-ups in the United States each year, 40 per cent close within 12 months, 80 per cent within five years, and 80 per cent of the remainder in the subsequent five years.
 Expanding programmes for management training, small business education and counselling, marketing assistance and financial management can bring down the failure rate dramatically.

How even at their worst, those friends hadn't collapsed at the mention of their departed loved ones.
 My pulse was already almost twice as fast as normal, and the room was just starting to wobble from side to side.
 Rachel was saying something, but I couldn't really hear her.
 The void was gaping below me, when something grabbed my shoulder and shook me surprisingly hard.
 I opened my eyes to see Rachel looking at me.
 "I'm sorry I had to do that, Adriana, but you need to hear what I have to say."
 Half of me wanted to be angry, but the other half just wanted to collapse into the void.
 Force of habit won over anger and I passively let my defenses crumble, but apparently being shocked out of a collapse functioned much the same as having just come out of an attack.
 For the next few seconds at least I was safe, could think about anything I wanted without fear of the repercussions.
 Only Rachel was talking, ruining my concentration, so the only thing I could focus on was her words.

Apparently, everyone in the dungeon is following me,” he said with a chuckle.
 “You saw them?” asked Doi’van.
 “Not exactly” he said.
 “I saw movement a few times.
 I just thought it might be them.
 I did not know for sure,” he explained.
 Doi’van asked Imeralda, “Did you know they were tracking us?” “No, I had no clue.” she said looking embarrassed.
 She then added, “I am not really a great tracker.
 I mean, our Paladin was easy enough to find but tracking Dire Cats through the forest, that would require true skill.” “But you did not sense them at all?” asked the Hellborn again.
 “No,” she shook her head.

A tree branch came from nowhere and smacked me flat across the face.
 Chevelle’s horse whinnied as they rode away.
 “Why always the face?” I yelled at his back.
 I winced as a second branch, this one young and green and more like a lash, struck me from behind.
 A fierce growl escaped me and I took off, running at full speed in the direction my horse had gone.
 By midday, I was completely spent.
 I had eventually caught my horse, but the training hadn’t let up.
 I was too exhausted for any anger to remain, but I had the sneaking suspicion Chevelle was enjoying my “lessons.” We stopped by a patch of snow that had gathered in a rock basin, warming it to water for the horses.
 Chevelle jumped down from his horse as I melted off the side of mine and onto a rock, my limbs like molasses.
 He came to sit across from me and I flinched, expecting another attack.

I waved goodbye as I stood and headed towards the doors.
 Amazingly enough, there was already a line in the office by the time I got there.
 Either the nerds who liked musicals didn't actually eat in the lunchroom, or some of the people who maintained a cool, disinterested facade actually wanted to see it.
 My enthusiasm ebbed lower and lower as I waited in line behind a number of people who it turned out didn't even want to see the show, but figured that this would be a great chance to get away from their parents for the better part of twelve hours.
 By the time I signed my name to a brightly-colored pink slip of paper, dropped it into the box, and walked out past the ridiculously-long line of people still waiting to enter the drawing, I knew for a certainty that I wasn't going.
 They'd posted the cost of the tickets, and I'd been right.
 My paycheck wasn't going to cut it.
 I was still trying to decide whether or not to head back into the cafeteria, when the first bell rang, signaling a fitting end to a disappointment-filled lunch.

 Alec actually walked into class, saw Mrs. Alexander wasn't there, and then turned around and left.

Eugene – Oh not that again.
 What caused the return that small piece of delusional fantasy?
 It was funny the first time, but it’s lost some of its charm in each re-telling.
 Jim – It’s not fantasy damn it.
 The Canadians are coming.
 Eugene – Sure they are.
 Johnny – Right after the Martians.
 Jim – I hope you like watching hockey, because in a few short years it’s all that will be on television.
 Mark my words.
 Eugene – Your words are marked.

Agriculture will remain the largest single occupation for the foreseeable future.
 For too long this sector has been regarded by planners primarily as the source of essential food production.
 Historically, agriculture has also played a major role as an engine for economic growth and employment.
 The Industrial Revolution in nineteenth-century England was spawned by rising productivity and incomes in agriculture that increased demand for manufactured goods.
 In post-war Japan, South Korea, and more recently Thailand, rising agricultural productivity and a shift to commercial crops have been dynamic engines for economic growth, job creation, higher incomes and rural purchasing power, wider markets for produce, and the growth of downstream industries.
 In Taiwan, this was the result of a conscious strategy to utilize agriculture to stimulate job creation and domestic demand.
 The vast technological gap between the levels of agricultural productivity achieved by most developing countries and the highest yields achieved globally represents an enormous untapped potential for stimulating economic growth and job creation.
 The reduction in agricultural subsidies to farmers in industrial nations called for in the recently signed GATT trade agreements will generate far higher international demand for agricultural exports from developing countries.
 In the next chapter, we argue strongly for an agriculture-led job creation strategy and cite evidence to show how it can generate sufficient jobs to eradicate poverty in many countries.

And, of course, then there’s “Burn my Bridges” and “Forget my Roots” off the second album.
 Even Buddy’s skillful acoustic playing can’t save those albums from their own wallowing, from their stooping to the lowest common denominator.
 Of course they sold.
 They were huge.
 Buddy played with Carole King, with the L.A.
 Session, with Linda Rondstadt.
 He was revered, honored (Grammy for “Song for L. Enos,” 1971), patted on his self-satisfied back.
 But it was all so vacuous.
 And, what for a Memphis musician is worse, so soulless.
 Buddy had gone to hell, many in Memphis thought, though no one said so.

Most of them looked just like Simon and Nathanial, pony-sized wolves moving with blinding speed as they tore through doors and raced down halls.
 Brandon came in immediately behind the first batch of wolves.
 There was no way I could've known that the gray monster who casually sliced through walls and two-by-fours with his wickedly curved claws was Brandon, but I was somehow certain.
 He was built just like Alec had been Friday night, only so much bigger that he had to crouch forward to avoid hitting his head on the unusually high ceilings.
 Donovan faced off against one of the first wolves, but it was obvious he was no match for the grace and power of his opponent.
 The gentle, aging butler was knocked to the ground between one heartbeat and the next.
 I was mercifully spared from seeing the wreckage left when Brandon's wolves moved on, but there was no doubt in my mind that Donovan was dead.
 Screams, distant enough that they had to be coming from the other wing of the house, reached out and pierced my heart.
 There wasn't any way to be sure whether or not it was Rachel or her mother, but ultimately it didn't really matter.
 Brandon was going to kill all of us.

"I like this one best."
 Marie had emerged from the dressing room carrying the black and pink suit.
 Rick looked up, managing a smile.
 "OK."  He bought it for her, looking forward to seeing her in it again tomorrow.
 He noticed that she'd bound her breasts again.
 "Listen, Marie, there are a couple of other things I want you to get."
 "What?"
 "Let's go in here."
 He led her into a large department store and began searching for ladies' lingerie.
 While Marie looked around at all the lacy, sometimes colorful articles, Rick found a saleslady.

On the other hand, if she didn't show, I had no other way to get to school, and Mom would freak out.
 Part of the reason she felt like she could be gone so much ever since the accident was the fact that I always did the responsible thing.
 If she started thinking I was cutting class, she was going be furious.
 It would be like I was behaving irresponsibly and taking away her ability to pursue her art, all at the same time.
 It was past time for the bus to arrive, and she still wasn't here.
 A car zipped around the corner driving way too fast, just like Britney always did, but it wasn't white.
 I looked past it, hoping to see another one following it.
 My mouth nearly hit the ground when I recognized the throaty roar and dark paint job of Brandon's Mustang.
 "I knew you'd be sitting here worrying she wouldn't come."
 It took a minute for the words to make sense.

The scene was from the point of view of someone looking into a bedroom window, darker than most of the later stuff I'd just looked at.
 The centerpiece, done in a dimmer light than what I remembered from my dreams, was the sleeping figure.
 She was delicate-looking.
 A tiny figure, a being of light temporarily clothed in flesh, one who seemed almost at the point of breaking out of her mortal husk.
 She was so breathtakingly beautiful it was several seconds before I noticed the other, nearly unformed details of the room.
 They were so indistinct it took me a full minute to place them.
 Once I did, my eyes darted back to the sleeping figure, the gorgeous one whose features I now recognized as Cindi's.
 Only it couldn't be Cindi because the room was mine, the one here in Sanctuary.
 My pulse racing, I refused to look at the signature again.
 I now knew what it was, but if I ignored it maybe I could ignore the ramifications of everything I'd just learned.

Today would be the first day in more than five weeks that she wouldn't see Rick.
 As much as she was looking forward to seeing Tom, that wasn't the same as knowing Rick would be home at 5:30, would kiss her and ask how her day had been, would hover around her as she made dinner.
 She just needed to get used to her life again, she told herself as she got dressed.
 She was where she belonged.

Neither of us were anxious to shoot anybody or die as heroes.
 But Cliff’s dad fought in Korea and wasted no respect on anybody who let other boys go to war while he attended college.
 Even before our tequila arrived, the Marines were telling us about a training film.
 It showed photos of camouflaged pits where guys fell onto sharpened and poisoned poles, and tunnels through which soldiers had to crawl chasing invisible warriors.
 Maybe the thoughts of death by poison or stabs in the dark made my stomach roil.
 Or maybe the cause was the sight of a dancer on the stage beside the bar.
 She was naked except panties sagged around her knees.
 I thought, the babe with auburn hair could be here in her place, if instead of having folks who were churchgoing gringos she had gotten born where I imagined this stoned, lost and weepy dancer had, as the fifteenth child of someone who lived in a hut beside a brown river.
 When a fellow vacated his bar stool, I excused myself from the table and moved there.
 I ordered another shot of tequila, and stared at the mirror behind the liquor shelf, wondering if I looked any different than before I surrendered to Jesus.

Get some sleep.” My mind was still slow, trying to process why he was holding my hand.
 I blinked and nodded.
 “Alright but if it starts getting crazy, wake me up.” “Wake you up?” he asked and laughed.
 “I'm sleeping too.
 If it gets crazy, they'll wake us up.” “Okay,” I said and yawned.
 I leaned my head against the tree and closed my eyes.
 The world seemed to fade around me, along with the bickering and Seth's hand, as I fell asleep.
 I opened my eyes to see that I was in a cave.
 I peered at the entrance of the cave to see that outside it was dark.
 I walked toward the entrance when something stopped me.

He whirled around.
 “Who’s there?” “Me, you idiot!” I snorted.
 He stared at the place where I was standing, but his eyes weren’t focused on me.
 “Jazell?” “Obviously, are you blind?” “I can hear you but can’t see you.
 Aren’t you back?
 Where are you?” “No.” I said frustrated, “Now tell us how you got back.” He closed his eyes and sat down.
 “I imagined myself in my body, and what is was like to be back.
 And then I was back to normal.
 Wait.” The wind picked up around him and then suddenly he was back, blue hair and all, standing beside his sitting, normal body.
 “Wow how did you do that?” Emily gasped.

Qurrah chuckled.
 “You’d be surprised,” he replied.
 “But will you accompany me tonight?”
 “Fine, fine, I will,” he said.
 “You will impress him, Harruq, do not worry about that.”
 Qurrah left his brother to rest.

 “Grab my wrist,” Qurrah said as the dark cloud arrived that night.
 Harruq did so, and together they stepped inside.

More than four of his own men lay dead around him, joined by three dead elves, five if he counted the two the half-orc had thrown through the doorway.
 A good ratio considering the skill of the elves, but not good enough.
 Men he had trained were dying, and for what?
 “I have honored your will, my lord,” he said.
 “But it is time I honor my men.”
 From his belt, he took a white horn bearing the symbol of Neldar.
 He put this ancient horn to his lips and blew.
 All throughout Woodhaven rumbled the signal to retreat.
 He gave the signal two more times before clipping the horn back to his belt and hobbling north.

He simply focused on the rightness of Doi’van’s words.
 Trying to attack an armed keep probably had far worse odds, and for what?
 So that they could steal horses; so that they could better their odds to escape a future fight?
 Here, if they succeeded, the three would not be stealing horses, they would be freeing people from slavery.
 Rodregas looked into Doi’van’s eyes.
 He was resolute.
 Rodregas felt humbled at the man’s bravery, at his passion, at his strength.
 Rodregas knew there was no such thing as a hero,  simply people that sometimes choose to do the right thing when it was a hard choice.
 There was no question for Doi’van, he simply stood quiet and ready.
 He knew what the right thing was, and he therefore took the right action.

"Adriana, your homework is progressing along very well.
 At the risk of having you slow down, I'm going to admit that you're well ahead of where I'd hoped you'd be.
 Another couple of weeks and you'll be caught up and ready for your makeup test."
 I shrugged uncomfortably.
 When teachers praised me, it always made me feel like I was socially deficient.
 I didn't necessarily mind the fact that I spent hours more on homework than any of my peers, but being praised for it always felt like a backhanded insult.
 "It's okay, I'm not going to slack off.
 I want to be done with extra assignments as badly as you want to be finished with having to grade them."
 My feeble joke evoked a smile, but I wasn't quite free to go.
 "Well, your homework is easier to grade than most.

I asked her if I could go meet Billy and Cliff.
 Knowing which way they would walk to the office from their auto shop class, around behind the football field, I took that route.
 The teacher was engaged with a carburetor and didn’t notice me trespassing in his class.
 I found Billy and Cliff wearing goggles, huddled over the head to a Chevy, grinding the valves.
 They had decided Mrs. Bole and whatever trouble they were in could wait.
 They had one more valve to grind.
 Then we stepped out into the sunlight.
 While I gave them the news, Cliff kicked gravel with both feet.
 Billy stared at the sky.
 His chin trembled.

I'd noticed Britney liked to position herself so she was closest to the middle of the hall.
 Admittedly, dodging all the people trying to get into their lockers wasn't much fun, but I suspected her real motivation was a desire to ensure she could see and be seen, which was much more easily accomplished by relegating me to the outside position.
 Normally I'd have just viewed her theatrics with amusement, but it'd been a long day and I wasn't in the mood.
 If I'd known for sure where we were heading, I'd have considered cutting her off, even with all of the probable fallout, but I didn't.
 Instead I just sighed, followed her around a corner, and collided with six-plus feet of muscled goodness packaged in a white polo shirt that looked worryingly familiar.
 Brandon caught me as I rebounded from him, easily stopping my momentum before I could stumble into a locker.
 "We'd better be careful; I'm starting to sense a trend."
 I wanted to say something equally witty, but his shirt did wonderful, probably illegal things to his gray eyes, and his perfectly straight teeth were parted in a friendly grin that couldn't possibly be meant for me.
 I managed a feeble grin before the silence stretched too far towards becoming uncomfortable, but it was a pathetic attempt.
 Brandon gently released my shoulders and detoured around me with a grace that should have looked unnatural on a boy, but which somehow exuded more masculinity than any four boys I'd known back home.

I'd expected it would just be Rachel and I, and that we'd make a quick run in to Sanctuary, which seemed silly seeing as how my house was just as close as town was.
 I was wrong on both accounts.
 The company, as Donovan had dubbed it, also included Dominic and Jasmin.
 Dominic had smiled shyly in my direction as we'd climbed into an ostentatious black Mercedes.
 Jasmin just looked like she'd rather be anywhere than on babysitting duty.
 Rachel had explained that Alec didn't want us delicate, fragile girls traveling alone, so he'd assigned us bodyguards, who happened to also be female and delicate-looking, but who weren't nearly as fragile.
 Also, it turned out we weren't going to Sanctuary, or St. George, or even anywhere in Utah, a fact I didn't realize until we'd been on the road for twenty minutes.
 "Oh, Adri, don't be silly.
 You can't do real shopping in Sanctuary.
 Besides, Alec wouldn't have let the four of us go alone if we'd been planning on staying so close to Brandon's territory.

“Don’t have much of a choice, do I?”
 He wrapped a long piece of cloth around his chest and then struggled to make his beefy hands tie a firm knot behind his back.
 Qurrah crossed the room, silent.
 He took the bits from Harruq’s hands and tied them in a double knot.
 “Do your best to convince Aurelia not to fight,” he said, his voice quieter than normal.
 “Do everything you can.
 Make her listen.”
 “I don’t want to kill her,” Harruq whispered.
 “Will you if you must?”
 The half-orc did not answer.

He had his ups and downs but he embraced his goal to help others who were afflicted by addiction as he was.
 He started in detox, which was fitting, as it is exactly where he began.
 It was a dirty job that we knew all too well.
 He described how he rubbed the backs of the young men who vomited and comforted them as they reeled in pain from withdrawals.
 He remembered the video of himself and the comparison was obvious.
 From there Brandon went through every stage of the program as an intern instead of a student.
 Brandon even took incoming calls from parents who had children that they were attempting to get into rehab, just as we had called when we were desperate to find our son a place that would help him.
 I have also volunteered my time through Narconon to talk to any parent who calls and wants to talk to another parent who has experienced the nightmare they are living.
 It is hard for me as they tell me their horrific stories of a life we once lived.
 They tell me it is great to talk to someone who understands what they are experiencing as a parent.

Bows cracked and broke in the hands of their masters.
 The few stray animals hit by the wave vomited their intestines and died.
 The elves that endured it found their minds a chaos of horrors, inescapable terror clutching their hearts.
 “ _Kill them all!_ ” the man in black screamed.
 The men charged, driven by madness they had never felt before.
 “Come, the battle is ours,” Sergan shouted, pulling against Antonil’s arm.
 The guard captain resisted the urge, his eyes locked on their supposed savior.
 “You are him,” Antonil whispered.
 “The man Dieredon spoke of.”
 “Come, Antonil Copernus,” the old veteran screamed, pulling harder.

He’s better at the former than at the latter, but he does try.

She continued rambling as she coated various parts of my body with lotions and powders, smoothed my hair with a sweet-scented cream, painted my lips with a soft balm that smelled of spice.
 After she ran out of areas to work with, she opened a tall glass container with black liquid inside and dipped a cut braid of hair into the bottle.
 She drew it out, using the tip to brush an intricate design on the inside of my wrist.
 When she was finished, she leaned over and blew gently on the paint.
 Or ink?
 I was anxious to see the finished work.
 I waited impatiently for her to raise her head again and hoped whatever it was wasn’t permanent.
 She finally glanced up at me, smiling an easy smile.
 I looked nervously at my wrist.
 It was magnificent.

 When Mom surfaced enough to notice how much weight I'd lost, she worried I was developing an eating disorder.
 She couldn't seem to understand that I hated the new me more than she did.
 Cindi was the skinny one.
 I'd tried to make myself eat enough to fill back out, but I'd had a hard time remembering meals lately.
 It was easier to just cinch my pants up a little and avoid mirrors.
 Even when I did remember, the calories in didn't seem quite able to keep up with the calories my body routinely burned up.
 I guess panic attacks are harder on your system than most people realize.
 My body had already started spiraling down to an attack again, but before I could get too wobbly, I made it inside the house.
 Mom met me at the bottom of the creaking stairs with a big smile on her tired face.

He spun on me, but I could not place the expression on his face.
 Panicked, I tried to recover.
 “You’re my watcher.” It still sounded angry, so I added, “Why?” He hesitated.
 “Frey…” His voice was gentle and he seemed to be searching for a way to answer.
 He must have decided I had no right to anger, because his face turned hard, his tone formal.
 “The council was concerned after you tried to choke Evelyn of Rothegarr.” I drew a sharp breath.
 “What are you talking about?” It caught me off guard; I was more than offended.
 Does he really think I choked Evelyn?
 I bit down against my words, remembering the trouble I was already in with Council.
 But that brought on an image of the speaker’s discolored face as he struggled for air, the blackened thistle in the back room at Junnie’s.

Several people are looking at the creations and acting like they are holding conversations as they move about and look at the exhibit.
 Liz and her mom are speaking apart from the crowd.
 Jim is in the background studying a painting, wearing a trench coat with the hood up some dark sunglasses and a set of Groucho Marx glasses, facing away from Liz and her mother.
 Cleo is smoking, from time to time she lights up a new one.
 Cleo – Your show is going fabulously darling.
 Liz – Yes, I seem to be a hit.
 Cleo – Isn’t it though.
 I imagine that you will be a big star when it is through baby.
 All our years of hard work are finally beginning to pay off.
 Liz – Yes all those years of work are finally paying off.

Because you’re as great as anybody.
 You’re Ken Kuhlken, and that’s all you need to be.
 You don’t need to prove anything.” When he let go, I jumped up, ran into the bathroom, and washed my face.
 I stared at my vicious expression in the mirror, amazed and perplexed.
 Though I couldn’t yet fathom how the simple fact that I was me, amongst all the billion people on earth, should give even a moment of solace, it did.
 Shortly before Easter, my Aunt Woody invited my mom for a Las Vegas weekend.
 Eric and I decided to join them.
 All night we sped across the desert.
 My mom and aunt were dressed for breakfast by the time we arrived, to their surprise and dismay.
 They loaned us their room until evening.

Stupid Internet.
 I can't believe they give our parents an account where they can see how we do on every test."
 Britney had my sympathy there.
 Nobody liked their parents knowing too much about their school life, academic or otherwise.
 "Wow, they talked about doing that at my last school, but I wouldn't have expected a town this small to have something like that implemented."
 We dropped our books off and started towards the cafeteria.
 Being back at my locker, back where I'd seen Mr. Gorgeous, made me wonder about him.
 Britney had to ask me a question twice before I realized she'd been talking.
 "Sorry, I was thinking about something."
 "Hmm, what distracted you?"

Making me his bride.
 I couldn’t understand.
 He tried to explain.
 “I want you forever.
 I need you, Lizzy.” The yearning in his voice was clear on the last part and I was surprised that I ached for him a little, felt for his pain and need.
 He touched me then and I thought I understood when he continued, “We could be together…” Marriage.
 Yes, he wanted to join us.
 I bit my lip, undecided.
 Curiosity was there, too.
 And I couldn’t help but imagine.

I looked the undercover narcotics officer in the face and blurted, “I’ll do the bust!” I’m raising my freaking hand like I am volunteering to coach a soccer team.
 I believe firmly that the deal to bust Steve should be forgiven due to the failure on the part of the police and the complete and total fiasco that had come from the officers not doing their homework and giving Brandon the same number that Steve already knew was an undercover cop’s phone.
 They have pushed me into a corner and I only see one absurd way out.
 “We don’t let parents work off deals to keep their kids out of prison,” Officer White responded after several moments of silent staring around the room.
 I didn’t plan on volunteering, and I strongly suspected (hoped?)
 I didn’t have a chance in hell at getting the officers to give me the go-ahead.
 I just said it because a father does whatever he can do to help his son.
 At least that is what I had always thought and that is what I had always done.
 Brandon looked at me as if he wanted to stop me but he lacked the clarity to speak, desperation the only thing evident on his weary face.
 The days since Brandon’s arrest had been some of the toughest days of his life.

He closed his eyes and attuned his mind to the village.
 A stench of fear trailed west.
 Women and children, all of them panicked and confused.
 “Harruq, they flee west,” Qurrah whispered, magically enhancing his voice using a spell Velixar had taught him.
 His quiet words flooded the town, audible by all yet still sounding like a whisper.
 The fleeing residents of the town heard and were terrified.
 His brother heard and obeyed.
 The two met at the edge of town.
 They saw scattered groups of families not far in the distance.
 “Get them, my brother,” Qurrah ordered.

Depositing the pan on the stove, he ran to the living room.
 She was sitting up, gasping for breath, a look of terror on her face.
 "What's wrong?"
 he asked, hovering over her.
 "I want to go home!
 I don't belong here--I want to go home!"
 Her heart was beating wildly, and she was having a hard time catching her breath.
 The fear and panic that had faded with fatigue and the novelty of it all were suddenly back full force, and all she knew was that she was far from home and from everything she knew.
 "Calm down.
 Calm down, Marie."

When she sat back down, he looked down at his brutish hands and muscles.
 She noticed and crossed her arms.
 “Velixar’s gift,” she said.
 “Do you still desire it?”
 Harruq closed his eyes, his fingers shaking.
 Deep within his chest, he felt a rage steadily growing.
 When Velixar had first given the strength to him, he’d felt an overwhelming desire to use it.
 Anger swelled inside, and when he looked to Aurelia he felt an enormous desire to attack.
 She was questioning his master, his brother, questioning what it meant to be him.
 When he opened his eyes, Aurelia stood, shocked by the red light wafting like smoke from Harruq’s eyes.

Chevelle pulled me away from Steed.
 “I’ll take her,” Ruby offered.
 “No.
 I’ll do it myself.” A lot of anger.
 “We’ll both go,” she pushed, forcing a polite tone.
 The rest of the group was quiet, watching us, and Ruby eyed Steed as we turned and headed toward the house.
 As soon as we were out of earshot, though I was still being dragged by the arm, I asked Chevelle, “Did something happen with the twins?” Ruby laughed.
 We both stared at her.
 “Twins,” she scoffed.
 “Right, well, you know what I mean,” I said, embarrassed.

Harruq glanced at Qurrah, who only chuckled louder.
 “We have little need for riches, noble.
 All we want is you.”
 The man paled.
 “Me?
 What do you want me for?
 The elves…‌they sent you to attack me, didn’t they?
 Whatever they paid you, I can double it.
 Triple it!”
 Qurrah shook his head.

Alec caught me before I hit the ground.
 "Are you ok?"
 "I think so.
 I thought I was past all of this recovery stuff."
 He looked concerned but I'd learned to read his expressions better than I think he realized.
 He was worried, but not just about me.
 He spent a lot of time worrying.
 The rest of the pack, the town, his mother, his sister.
 It was a lot for someone our age to deal with.
 "There's an uncommon amount of that going around right now."

“Very well.
 I will continue tracking them.
 There have been no murders for the past few days.
 It seems our warnings have worked, for now.”
 Aurelia smiled.
 “Praise Celestia for that.
 May she watch over you, Dieredon.”
 “And you as well, Aurelia Thyne,” he replied.

I smelled something odd and glanced down.
 The meat I was holding had burnt in my hand.
 I cursed, dropping it onto the plate.
 When I looked back to them, Steed was watching me, smiling.
 I tossed the burned meat onto the table, considering going back to bed.
 Ruby laughed and it made my hair stand on end.
 No, I’d stay.
 She might be our host now but I’d get my chance.
 I’d fix her.
 She shifted and the markings on her leg caught my attention.

I think we must choose carefully.” Doi’van said and added, “For me the Bunei seems right.” Doi’van paused in that thoughtful way he had, considering all sides before taking action.
 “If it consumes my Infernal power I would gain its strengths.
 If I am lucky, what magic ability I have left will be mortal or Celestial in nature.
 The Bunei are creatures of magic, they are both great warriors and thinkers and magicians and are even known to sometimes help others.
 I cannot pass this chance up.
 I must see what will happen.” Rodregas nodded; they both knew they would not get this chance twice.
 Doi’van saw in the Bunei what Rodregas had felt in the lion in the main hall.
 “See any good Infernal sigils for me?” Rodregas asked.
 “I should bind my Infernal gift as well, especially as I will never be a great magician.” Rodregas had not really expected an answer, but Doi’van surprised him by nodding his great head and pointing to the far back almost in a corner that strangely was the only one in shadow.
 “I think the Ni’Barrbari, the daemon known as the Night Panther, would add a bit of subtly to your Celestial Lion.

Maybe Fannie should have been punished for whatever she had done, but how could they assume I would follow in her footsteps?
 So I’d killed a bird, stolen a few papers from the council library.
 My argument faltered, so I went back to anger, betrayal that he had lied to me.
 And not just him.
 The entire village must have known I was bound, known I couldn’t perform magic, as they sat and watched me try.
 Sending me to Junnie for lessons, allowing Evelyn to taunt me without recourse, giving me the blame for everything that happened.
 Because they expected me to turn.
 The horses slowed to a stop, irritating me further.
 I didn’t even have control over that.
 Chevelle stepped down and started a fire.

It felt right there and I knew I should have been wearing it all along.
 As I let go, I realized I’d gotten blood on my hands, so I headed to the hall and poured water from the pitcher into a ceramic basin.
 Staring into the mirror was not my favorite pastime.
 It mostly made my head hurt.
 But I had to clean the blood from my face and straighten the nest of hair on my head.
 When I leaned forward, a flash caught my eye.
 For a moment I thought the pendant was reflecting light from somewhere in the dark hallway, but my brain must have been still muddled from sleep.
 I examined the stone closer and saw blood had gotten smudged there as well, so I rinsed it clean.
 I lingered there, clutching it tight in my hand.
 It was a comfort to hold.

"I love you."
 She didn't respond, pulling away from him to carry the glasses to the table.
 With a sigh he took plates from the cabinet.

 "Yes.
 It's beautiful.
 It's covered with lace and pearls, and it has a 15-foot train.

Caught, I walked cautiously out of the trees.
 He turned, tossing the cloak aside as he propped one leg onto a rock.
 I had the strangest notion he was posing.
 He scrutinized me, and I resisted the urge to straighten my hair and brush the dirt from my clothes.
 “Don’t be shy.” The stranger beckoned, gesturing to an upturned log beside the fire.
 The meat sizzled and popped as I crossed to him and sat obediently.
 It was too late to hide; I might as well at least have something decent to eat.
 Its smell was unfamiliar, but I didn’t care.
 It smelled like food.
 He reached down and tore a hunk from the spit, tossing it to me with a wink.

Doi’van, sounding like granite, said, “I know Taiga is involved.” The other two nodded, but did not pursue that thought.
 Rodregas then said, “I agree we are just starting to figure out that there is something big going on.
 I can’t believe even the Immortalists would be crazy enough to go up against both the Celestial Gods and the Daemon Lordsof the Infernal though.” Imeralda nodded and said, “What price is so high as to be even better than God hood?” The three sat silent for a few minutes soaking in that question.
 Rodregas looked at Imeralda and asked, “Well, we can’t answer that today, but how did you break Van’dret’s spell?” Imeralda nodded and with a smile said, “I always hoped that if I had to take on a sorcerer it would be in the Forest where I would have an edge, but no, it had to be in a hallway!
 I knew my regular spells; he would counter without a problem.
 So I had to work around the spell.
 The spell was one to hold you from walking or running.
 I actually tried to dance or hop,” she said with a smile.
 “But he was too good, he had those covered.
 But, I have been practicing a spell to float in the air, and that worked.

Any thoughts about finding out why hiking was off limits quickly melted away once class started.
 Math had never been my favorite subject.
 I'd always managed to pull A's or at least A-'s, but hated all of the little nitpicky rules.
 Unfortunately, after missing a whole month of classes, I was at least as bad off in Algebra as I was in Biology.
 Mrs. Campbell was solving problems with so many variables in them it was like watching alphabet soup spontaneously re-arrange itself on her overhead projector.
 Not only that, things were being squared and cubed, an operation with which I had only passing familiarity.
 I struggled valiantly to understand what was going on.
 I got the sense the operations being applied to the formulas were being explained very well, I just didn't have the vocabulary to follow what she was saying.
 By the time class finally ended I was fighting not to become emotional.
 The fact that Britney looked for a moment like she was debating whether or not to wait for me before finally stopping next to the door with her arms crossed, didn't help.

He thought I wouldn’t give up because I’d seen the map.
 Something about that nagged at me, but Ruby waited while I searched for a response.
 Chevelle opened the door and I knew I was saved from at least that much.
 When he saw me, he was struck still.
 I had forgotten Ruby’s “treatments” until she squealed in delight at his response.
 He composed his face again, but she’d already marked him.
 “Oh, you like it.
 She’s fabulous, isn’t she?” She was so proud of herself, but I could tell Chevelle was embarrassed he’d been caught off guard.
 It might have pleased me too, except that I couldn’t tell if it was less how I had changed and more the resemblance to my mother.

A tiny snake sunning on a nearby rock caught my eye and I smiled.
 Some part of me knew what had happened before, had felt it.
 I could do it again.
 I slipped the tip of the sword down to the tracker’s leg, just above where his knee met the ground, and sliced his trousers up to the thigh to reveal bare skin.
 Drawing the snake close with magic, I took it in my hand, its thin green body writhing over my left palm, the sword grasped in my right.
 The prisoner watched me, almost smug.
 It was a small snake, its white belly confirming it was nonvenomous, its frame no thicker than my pinkie, but it would do.
 I slid the tip of the sword across the skin above the man’s knee, making a narrow incision.
 His expression did change then, giving way to uncertainty.
 I smiled at him as the sword tip rested against his leg.

Before you walked into my garden.” “An article about me?” “Yeah.
 You and your family.
 A group Teri works with threw a 1920s party, and she gave me a book about the 1920s.
 There was a section about you.” “What did it say?” “It had information about your father and his business and how he disinherited your brother.
 And it said that you married Davis and had three children and-and .

The night is young.
 Taint the dreams of the slumbering.”
 Qurrah left Velixar to sit alone before the fire.
 The dark night sang a song of crickets and wind.
 In the quiet, Dieredon entered the light of the fire.
 “Greetings, traveler,” the elf said, bowing.
 “The town is not far, and all are welcome.
 Would you not sleep in safety rather than in the wild?”
 Velixar looked at the elf, dressed in camouflaged armor and holding his wicked bow.
 “You are a scoutmaster for the Quellan elves, are you not?” he asked.

The two glanced at each other.
 Harruq shrugged.
 “That was easy.
 Bed time?”
 “Sleep if you must,” Qurrah said.
 “I will join you in a bit.”
 Harruq removed his armor, lay down on the bed of straw, and slept.
 The necromancer stepped outside his home, walked to the side, and stared at the flickering lights in the distance.
 Campfires and torches.
 An army, the same that had removed him and his brother from their home, slept so close.

Rick asked.
 "Hey--your hair looks great!
 It looks longer now."
 "It was curled before--that makes it look shorter.
 I need to get it cut."
 "No!"
 A bit embarrassed by his exclamation, he explained, "I like your hair better the way it is now.
 It's pretty."
 She thought about the women she'd seen yesterday.
 "Some women have their hair bobbed now."

“It even looks all pretty,” he said, eliciting a laugh.
 “Do Qurrah now.”
 Aurelia did not begin writing immediately, instead thinking over the pronunciation.
 “Qurrah,” she said at last.
 “It is a little tricky, but I bet it is spelled like this.”
 Letter by letter she wrote ‘Qurrah’ in the dirt.
 Harruq stared at it, whispering his brother’s name as his eyes traced the letters.
 As he did, a thought hit him.
 His eyes went back and forth from his own name and Qurrah’s.
 “You spelled my name wrong,” Harruq said.

Liz – Hey Geney, where’s your ‘gangsta’ gear?
 I’m surprised you don’t have it with you, since you spent so much money on it.
 Jim – Didn’t you hear?
 Gene’s not a gangsta any more.
 He tried impressing some other gang-banger wannabes and they kicked his ass…
 Eugene – They didn’t kick my ass.
 Liz – What didja do?
 Throw around the gang signs like that one time we ran into those real gang members?
 Remember that Jim?
 Jim – Yeah, it was one of the funniest things I ever saw.

“Frey.” “Yes.” It was all I could manage.
 His eyes held mine and I could swear he was searching for something.
 He opened his mouth to speak, but the door of the wardrobe flew open.
 “Oh.” Ruby giggled the tiniest bit.
 “Excuse me.
 I didn’t mean to interrupt.” She seemed pleased she had.
 Chevelle’s hand dropped and I could see out of the corner of my eye his face was hard.
 Ruby continued, “Steed said you had a guest so I just used the back…” She trailed off when his stare didn’t soften, but she smiled.
 “You know, you do have your own room.” He stiffened and stood, not at all amused by her implication.
 Ruby began gathering things as she spoke, pretending she hadn’t noticed his attitude.

It was not large, ordinarily holding only about a dozen horses.
 He looked around to find that it was emptied out, except for the two carriage horses.
 They must have been left in case Ravenhurr wished to travel, which would be unlikely with all his guards and servants scattered over the town, but good servants did not take their master’s transport from him.
 In the open central area, he saw both the small carriage and the supply wagon that Ravenhurr used for traveling and carry supplies back and forth to the keep.
 He looked at it and smiled.
 With the carriage horses and wagon he could strip a lot of useful items out of the keep.
 He went next door to the smith’s and started gathering up tools, and loading them up into the smith’s travel trunk.
 The nicest tools were in a cabinet, and with a grunt (it was heavy even for him) he picked it up and loaded it into the cart, along with some other useful implements.
 He would need to carry as much food as possible as well.
 He quickly went back into the main keep and wrapped up the mattress from Captain Poir’s bunk and started carrying barrels of flour and other foodstuffs to his pile next to the front entrance.

It wasn't until Britney pulled me closer that I understood why.
 Brandon stood surrounded by his friends on one side of the circle, with Alec and a smaller group standing opposite them.
 The tension in the room was like the air before a lightning strike, charged and unpredictable, a living organism on the point of materializing out of thin air and attacking anything surrounding it.
 Taking in the two groups, I was amazed at the disparity before my eyes.
 The kids behind Brandon were half again as many as the gathering behind Alec, and they were eager for the confrontation, watching with excited eyes, and large smiles.
 Alec's company on the other hand awaited the coming fight with calm exteriors and a sense they were bowing before the inevitable conflict without conceding anything to their opponents.
 They were fewer in number, but the men were larger than anyone other than Alec or Brandon, and I somehow knew even the girls were dangerous.
 With a sudden start I realized the confrontation wasn't between Brandon and Alec as I'd originally thought.
 Instead the stuck-up blonde I'd first met in the office, was squared off against a brunette less than three-quarters her size.
 As Britney pulled us even closer, almost into the dead zone between the two factions, I finally realized the smaller girl was Rachel.

It was interesting what she said, but he was not sure why she was bringing it up at this time.
 “Only the Immortalist have ever taken on the essence of a Celestial Beast as they get ready to become gods,” Imeralda continued.
 Her eyes wandering around the arena, waiting.
 Her voice had a casual quality, but Rodregas sensed she thought this very important.
 “When Doi’van sees you, he thinks of you as one of the blood, a noble in fact, if not by birth.
 Most of the men and women in this circle are that; faster, stronger because they descend from a Celestial god.
 But you are not that.
 The Celestial Beasts all represent something.” She paused, looking at him for the first time.
 “What does The Lion represent, Rodregas?” she asked.
 Rodregas was silent for a moment and then said, “Strength, the Hunter, and Protector of the Pride.” He spoke words that he knew he had learned as a child at temple.

The three sat there for a minute and then stepped away to rest against the far wall to get some distance from Van’dret’s body.
 After a few minutes Doi’van said, “Well, one more Immortalist down, that’s good.” The other two nodded.
 Rodregas said, “We did not learn much more though.
 We still don’t really understand why they are interested in Infernal power now and willing to break The One Law.” “You mean if that is what they are doing.
 We really don’t know for sure, other than for Ravenhurr,” said Imeralda.
 Doi’van, sounding like granite, said, “I know Taiga is involved.” The other two nodded, but did not pursue that thought.
 Rodregas then said, “I agree we are just starting to figure out that there is something big going on.
 I can’t believe even the Immortalists would be crazy enough to go up against both the Celestial Gods and the Daemon Lordsof the Infernal though.” Imeralda nodded and said, “What price is so high as to be even better than God hood?” The three sat silent for a few minutes soaking in that question.
 Rodregas looked at Imeralda and asked, “Well, we can’t answer that today, but how did you break Van’dret’s spell?” Imeralda nodded and with a smile said, “I always hoped that if I had to take on a sorcerer it would be in the Forest where I would have an edge, but no, it had to be in a hallway!
 I knew my regular spells; he would counter without a problem.

Maybe on account of being an only child, ever since I can remember, I have longed for a best friend to whom I could tell all the crazy stuff I think and feel.
 A best friend is what I hoped Karen Flagstad could be.
 I used to think, with someone who could know my secrets and also douse the fire in me and thereby keep me from all the nonsense men do on account of women, I could live content and free.
 I won’t argue the chicken and egg question, does our desire for intimacy rise out of our need for God, or is our belief in God the desperate attempt to satisfy that inborn desire for intimacy.
 But I’m placing my bets on the former, the need for God answer.
 Which is why, on this road trip, I find myself hopeful to the point of desperation that, taking a cue from Brother Lawrence, I can learn to adore God enough so that he will become my daily companion, whom I count on and trust with my failings and secrets.
 Suddenly, maybe invited by all the remembering, a whole other wave of thought takes hold of me.
 I find myself muttering a line a line from Kerouac, maybe from Dharma Bums.
 “If we knew time, we would know everything.” While contemplating that idea, I begin to suspect that in some real though unfathomable way I’m not only here and now, driving alongside the silvery ocean, in Pismo Beach, June 2010.
 I’m also with my last best friend Olga, a few years ago, talking about poetry in a Greek Café.

 Kill me now, but forever, they’ll hear my voice, forever those words will be out there, battling against philistinism, against commercialism, against Moloch.

It took us half the day to get there, but it was worth it.
 It’s so far away from any kind of traffic, I have no idea how she even discovered it.
 Nestled in a patch of trees outside the forest was some sort of camp.
 I watched her at first.
 She scoured the area searching through the things she found there.
 But I couldn’t observe for long.
 I revealed myself and inquired about her previous finds and all the questions that were plaguing me.
 She was furious!
 She screamed and cursed and fumed.
 She was no help with my queries so I was forced to look around myself.

“Did the dwarfs tell you anything?” I asked, taking the paper.
 None of what she wrote on the paper made any sense to me.
 She shook her head.
 “No and if they did, I was too busy trying to burn them to hear them.” She took the paper back.
 “Well I think the only thing we’ve established is that toad dwarves are crazy.” Seth said.
 I noticed a thin, red line on his cheek where a thrasher must have scratched him.
 Emily wagged her finger at him.
 “Never dis facts.
 They might save you later in life.” Seth just snorted.
 Jason punched him in the side.

He'd sunk down beside me while he was talking, resting with his hands behind his head so he could look up at the few thinly-stretched clouds.
 I took the opportunity to move closer, cuddling up next to him.
 I didn't bother looking up at the sky.
 Truth be told, I had all the beauty I needed right in front of me.
 His slight start as my head came to rest on his arm was disappointing but entirely predictable.
 He adjusted my blanket slightly so it was between us and then pulled me closer.
 He was perfectly happy to touch me as long as there wasn't any actual skin on skin contact.
 Every time I pushed for more he backed away or found somewhere else he had to be.
 "That must have been rough.
 There are a lot of strong personalities down there."

On this issue the evidence is clear.
 Protectionism reduces overall economic welfare, often hurting those with the lowest incomes.
 In the long term greater international trade, like technology, expands overall employment opportunities substantially.
 Trade also counters the tendency of prices to increase along with incomes in more developed countries.
 Living standards rise as consumers benefit from the availability of lower-priced imported consumer goods.
 One of the greatest barriers to solving the world’s employment problem is the perception that trade destroys jobs.
 As in the case of technology, the interactions are complex and must be viewed in their entirety, rather than in isolated industries.
 The global economy is not a zero sum game in which increased production by one country must necessarily result in reduced production by another.
 Trade opens up new opportunities.
 It permits each country to specialize in industries where it possesses a ‘comparative advantage’.

“The human alphabet.
 And you’re going to learn it.”
 He protested, but it was a weak protest.
 They went over the alphabet several times until Harruq could repeat most without thinking too hard.
 “I want you to take it home with you,” she said when they were done.
 To her annoyance, Harruq refused to accept the book.
 “I really don’t want to take it,” he said.
 “Why not?”
 “Well I, just…” His face turned a mixture of gray and red.
 “Qurrah doesn’t know I’m doing this.”

He had never been given great gifts, but that did not mean that he should not give great gifts to others.
 Doi’van’s help would be priceless; he was clearly a powerful warrior.
 Imeralda was also going to walk this path with them, and he would never get what the armor and bow were worth on the black market so… Rodregas reached down first and opened the trunk and said, “Well, if you are going to be traveling with us for a while, this won’t fit either of us guys.
 So it makes most sense for you to have it.” He started handing her the Mithril chain armor.
 Her eyes grew bright at the sight of the silver chain and she went, “Oh, my god, you bastard!
 You had this in the wagon all along.
 Do I really get to have it?” Rodregas smiled and said, “As long as you are sharing the journey with us.” She took several moments to appreciate the armor and started to try it on; Rodregas waited, enjoying her appreciation of his stolen gift.
 Just as she started to calm down he said, “Oh, and didn’t you say something about wanting a bow?
 And quietly, he handed her one of the Black Yew recurves.
 She reached for it with a smile and as soon as she touched it she just stared at it.

I knew Buddy Gardner and I was still startled by much that is found here.
 It’s his voice alright, but there’s an anger there, a tension, that surprised me.
 Buddy Gardner, when I knew him was a sweet, soft-spoken man, a man driven by ambition, sure, but, underneath that, there was a humility and a human heart .
 It’s all here in these tapes, so enough said.
 Three weeks after these interviews were concluded, Buddy Gardner was found dead in his home, with a needle in his arm.
 Lorelei had disappeared.
 These tapes somehow also disappeared until 1999, when they were found in a stockroom in an abandoned studio in Los Angeles by a technician there who, with some heaven-sent Extra Sensitive Perception, sent them to Camel Jeremy Eros, c/o City Lights Bookstore, where for a while I was taking my mail, while recovering from a broken relationship, one that emasculated me, silenced me, did me up a treat.
 These tapes were a godsend—they took me out of myself, out of the self-pity I was wallowing in.
 Many thanks to John Wender, editor extraordinaire, who recognized what we had here and ran them in his celebrated periodical.
 Hence, they ran first, almost in the form represented here, in three installments in Big City Magazine.

Why do you hope so now?”
 “Because these arrows are different.”
 He fired three at once, all burying deep into Velixar’s chest.
 The man in black screamed as the sacred water burned his skin.
 He fell to one knee and vomited a pile of white flesh and maggots.
 “You will suffer,” he gasped.
 “For ages, I will make you suffer.”
 “Try it,” said Dieredon.
 Two more arrows flew, but they halted in mid-air.
 Velixar stood, his hand outstretched, gripping the projectiles with his mind.

You have a job where you wear your name on your shirt.
 Eugene – You don’t do all that well when you’re at school, and it’s not like you’re going to some high class college, you’re at a low end public university.
 Johnny – And when was the last time you had a date with a woman?
 Eugene – I don’t think it has been any time in recent years.
 Johnny – It’s been a long time.
 Jim – You’re questioning my love life?
 Johnny, you’ve never had a date in your life, and some times I doubt that you ever will.
 And Gene, well I don’t know where to start with you, the last time you went out with someone was during that week that you thought you might be gay.
 Now I’m not an experienced judge of what makes another guy attractive, but I would have to say that your date was the single ugliest man I’ve ever seen in my life.
 Eugene - Frank was not ugly, well he was ugly, but he was a nice guy and a good friend.

 And the cows do moo and the Asses bray.
 Yet as I dance in the rain and do weep, Yonder figure turns to walk away.
 (speaks directly to the audience)What say you my good dear man?
 Dost the line and verse drive one to the ends of emotional rationality?
 Yes as I did think, and so I thought.

“Yes, now go!”
 Harruq kicked open the barricaded door and then barged up the stairs.
 Qurrah withdrew a few pieces of bone from a pouch.
 He tightened his grip about them, whispering a few words of magic as he did.
 Then he looked to the window.
 He could barely see a bow and part of a hand.
 Qurrah waited.
 The Neldaren warriors charged, hoping to overwhelm their opponents before arrows took them all.
 The elf in the window leaned out to unleash a killing strike, but it was Qurrah who did the killing.
 Four pieces of bone leapt from his hand.

The poor lad had stared at the man who had been his father, saying nothing, but tears ran down his cheeks.
 The apprentice Immortalist had then proceeded to rape the mother.
 The Adapt was rough and the act was violent and Korin, in his new body, clearly enjoyed the violence more than the sex.
 After he had finished with the mother, he had the guards release the boy who had run over to his sobbing bleeding mother.
 In a fatherly gesture Korin had kissed the boy on the cheek and, wrapping his hands around the boy’s head in a slow loving gesture, made a quick yank and broke Join’s neck.
 The next day the guards released the young AElfin widow.
 Rodregas had helped drag her beyond the gates.
 She lay there not moving, limp though alive; she was dead in every way that mattered.
 Rodregas went back into the keep without looking back; he never knew what had happened to her after that.
 After dreaming every night about killing him, Rodregas now had Korin in his grip.

Whatever else he was, he wasn't the thoughtless jerk Brandon had proven himself to be.
 "I'm sorry, Adriana.
 I wish we could, for Rachel's sake as well as yours, but it's just too risky.
 Fewer witnesses means more chance Brandon's people will try to arrange for something to happen.
 There are just too many of them for us to meet them in a stand-up fight and come out unscathed."
 I didn't like it.
 Mrs. Campbell was the only teacher who'd taken an active interest in my wellbeing, but I could see his point.
 I managed to do at least a passable job hiding my near frown as I nodded in acceptance.
 "Can I have just a few minutes today after school to tell her?"
 Alec's hand was warm on my face as he nodded.

She was so sweet and loving.
 When she returned, he took the aspirin and drank the juice, obeying when she insisted that he lie down on the sofa so that she could bathe his face with cool water.
 Marie patted his forehead with the washcloth, dipped it into the bowl of water, wrung it out, and then patted his forehead again.
 "Maybe a good night's sleep will help ward off a cold."
 She kissed his temple.
 He took her hand, pressing his lips into her palm.
 "Lie down here with me."
 She stretched out beside him, and finally, with Marie in his arms, he fell asleep.
 But when he awoke the next morning, she wasn't there.
 Panicking, he jumped up.

Her body ached with a pleasure that seemed too intense to bear.
 Intoxicated, she wrapped her arms around Rick’s neck, moaning.
 Powerfully aroused by that moan, Rick slid one hand down her back to press her closer.
 She shuddered with pleasure as he began kissing her neck.
 He undid the first button on her dress.
 "I want you, Marie," he rasped, raising his head to look into her eyes.
 Marie gazed into his eyes for a moment.
 "I can't!"
 she whispered hoarsely.
 "I can't do it.

Oh, naw, no.
 I mean, I was about five and my parents had this set of records, this Reader’s Digest set, and there was this one song that I fell in love with on it, used to go around the house, scatting it, at five.
 It was “I Can’t Get Started” by Bunny Berigan.
 I don’t know.
 I can still play that one.
 CM:  	So, you grew up in a musical house?
 Music was part of your everyday life?
 BG:  	(laughs) Shit, no.
 Why would that follow?
 I mean, we had this console thing, whatever the hell they called them, big as a basilisk, a monstrous thing that had a radio and record player.

As I went to leave the car, he grabbed me by my back pocket, which nearly made me shriek in surprise.
 "Hey, you know what you need to put all this in perspective?"
 "No, but then I think it's more than just a matter of my perspective being off."
 My fear of alienating him had almost vanished in the rush of indignation over how he'd grabbed me.
 I wanted to say something even more snarky, but there was just enough worry left to curb my tongue.
 Mostly.
 "You need to come to the party Friday night."
 "You mean the monthly kegger?"
 Brandon shook his head, still flashing the grin that made it almost impossible to remain mad at him.
 "No, the monthly full moon 'kegger' happened last weekend.

 Jim – Another pleasant mood I see.

 Johnny – Fuck you.
 I’m outta here.

 Liz – What’s his problem?

Playing electric, like the blues, like the devil music from which it came, you just gotta give it the juice, you gotta play for all the money.
 Man, I did that, I could feel it.
 Feel the devil chasing me down.
 But, it’s a high, right?
 Like all good highs there are consequences.
 But, I’ve never changed direction, man.
 I’m going in a straight line.
 When it’s all over you’ll see the line.
 My footprints all headed in one direction—you’ll see it, eventually.
 Everybody will.

The shimmery nature of the fabric combined with an unusually angular, sharp cut to make it different than anything else I'd ever seen.
 I worked my way up from the blindingly-polished black shoes, to the splash of deep red peeking out of his chest pocket, and somewhere along the way decided I loved the tux.
 As amazing as James' and Isaac's tuxes were, I was already looking past them, craning my neck to see down the hall in a vain effort to catch a glimpse of Alec.
 There was no reason for my heart to be pounding away so furiously in my chest, but unlikely or not, my body at least seemed convinced he was going to change his mind and leave me standing here by myself.
 Rachel looked up from her conversation with Jasmin just long enough to give me a reassuring smile, and then I heard the barest whisper of sound.
 I spun around with a speed that gave lie to all of my pathetic attempts to pretend like I hadn't been worried.
 Alec was standing in the doorway, having crossed the distance down the hall faster than I would've believed possible, appearing almost as if by sorcery.
 His shoes were every bit as shiny as James', leading up to slacks that could've been mistaken for shiny, but were actually something else, something with more depth than anything I'd seen before.
 The coat was made out of the same material, tailored tightly enough it managed to emphasize rather than conceal his massive shoulders and chest.
 His pocket square matched his bow-tie, both of which were the exact shade of green used on my dress.

 So can we get back to finding a new name?
 Liz – They must have beaten him up.
 Jim – They didn’t like you pretending to be a biker did they?
 Eugene – No, they didn’t seem to, so they asked me to stop.
 Jim – And you did?
 They asked you to stop and you did?
 Why didn’t I think of that?
 Eugene – There were eight large hairy men, and they had knives and clubs.

** The sound of my alarm pulled me out of a whole series of nightmares in which I was running from unknown menaces.
 Each had been terrifying, but none as vivid as the first.
 Bad dreams had become a frequent companion since the accident.
 It'd become nearly passé to wake up emotionally exhausted from what should have been a restful night, but these dreams had been different.
 I'd played out nearly every possible combination of events since the accident.
 Dreams where I was the one driving instead of Cindi.
 Dreams where I got a ride home with someone so Dad and Cindi didn't have any reason to be on the road.
 Dreams where I was in the truck that killed them, even dreams where I was in the back seat as a passenger at the moment of impact.
 I was used to awaking shaking and scared countless times during the course of a night, but I'd never felt that level of pure, bestial fear.
 I stumbled into the bathroom and flipped on the light, only to groan at how ghastly I looked.

Now Korin looked very surprised and he started looking around.
 Rodregas saw that Korin noticed the study door, though he was working hard to not show it.
 “How many?” Rodregas repeated his question.
 “I am not sure,” Korin said.
 “For us to truly become divine we must of course develop our skills.” As Korin answered the question he took a step back.
 Rodregas quickly stepped forward and pushed him hard against the wall.
 Korin hit with a hard smack and slid to the ground, hurt, but not badly.
 Rodregas slammed the door closed and relocked it.
 Then he quickly reached down and covered Korin’s mouth, pulled him up, and slipped behind him.
 Rodregas saw Korin’s bulging eyes as he tried to get a better look at his captor.

I will be honest Rodregas, I am not sure that this will work.
 These warriors are trained in the use of the lance and their war horses will negate your personal advantage in physical might, as your horse is a trail mount.” Doi’van paused and said, “But, the real problem is that you are without plate armor.
 I am not sure how you can survive such a competition.
 The competition with mace or hammer will be only marginally better for you.
 Your body is far stronger than theirs, but not as strong as Night Bronze or Mithril.” Doi’van shook his head.
 “I don’t know how you can compete with simple steel!” “Rodregas,” Doi’van said, “I think you should give up on this task, the Cathedral is busy; and none will know if we simply leave.” Imeralda nodded, but something about the way she stood told Rodregas that she knew he would not do this.
 “So have you done the math?” Rodregas asked.
 “What if I get five points on the hand-to-hand and five with the sword and shield and maybe two with the bow?
 Would twelve points get me to the final?” “Unlikely,” answered Doi’van.
 “I have asked around and fifteen seems to be the magic number.

The hard currency requirement is minimal.
 But the plan does re quire a leading role by government and financial assistance to farms.
 In order to be effective, it needs to be supported by a massive public education campaign on use of new technology to eradicate crop losses combined with demonstration plots on both large-scale and small private farms throughout the country.
 The Commission recommends immediate implementation of the plan with the objective of improving the agricultural economy, increasing the food supply and completely eliminating dependence on food imports.
 4.Study benefits of economic union: Of the estimated 50 per cent fall in GDP among the republics of the former Soviet Union, approximately half can be attributed to the break-up of the economic union.
 Restoration of a common economic space – which is being criticized internationally as a surrender of sovereignty to Russia at a time when both Western Europe and North America are striving for closer economic union – could immediately restore most of that lost output.
 The advantages of cooperation between republics needs to be care fully examined.
 A study should be conducted by a credible institution to estimate the economic losses incurred by the break-up of the common economic space between the former Soviet re publics and to assess the benefits of restoring an economic union in some form.
 It should estimate overall economic growth and living standards for each republic over the next five years operating within and outside the economic union.
 This study can serve as a powerful argument for closer cooperation among the republics.

Neither the mechanism of state planning and control nor the mechanism of market prices can accomplish this on their own.
 A blending of their values and methods – freed from the blinkers of dogma and the determinism of limited imagination – can lead us to the answer.
 Wider Perspective on Transitions
 The outcome of all great social transformations – of which the present instance ranks in magnitude and importance with that of the French Revolution and the movement which freed India and so many other former colonies from imperialism, economic exploitation and cultural domination – depends on the degree to which individuals and institutions within the society have been prepared to understand, accept and respond to the new environment ushered in by the transition.
 Two hundred years ago the people of France were ready to overthrow the old order but ill-prepared to create anything new, with the result that the old soon re-established itself and lived on for another century.
 It took India’s leaders more than four decades to prepare their people for freedom and it has taken another four to overcome the vestiges of colonial rule that prevented the country from releasing its energies for prosperity.
 Long after the foreign conquerors had left, colonialism lived on in the institutions of government and in the attitudes of the population.
 Decades of freedom and education were needed for the country to outgrow a sense of inferiority, a seeking for security, a feeling of submissiveness and complacency, and to acquire a sense of pride, ambition, high aspirations and expectations, a seeking for achievement, and a spirit of adventure and enterprise – and still the task is not complete.
 Development is like a chemical reaction that is determined by the variety and quantity of elements present and the conditions under which they are put together.
 If one essential element or condition is missing, a social transition like a chemical reaction may not take place at all.

“Why do you think Seth won’t tell us what he was doing?” I asked, watching her because she had refused to let me help.
 “Pride purposes?
 He was yelling at you when he broke his own rules.
 He just doesn’t want to admit he did” she said through her wild hair.
 Her lock finally clicked and she stood up.
 The boys were walking side by side towards the play set.
 It wasn’t actually that small but it looked that way from the street.
 There were six swings and a tower with four slides attached to it.
 I ran after them with Emily right behind me.
 I slowed down next to Jason and put my arm on his shoulder.

The feeling intensified even more as first Jessica and then Jasmin picked up the same strange, near epileptic quiver.
 James let out a low, grating growl, and my stomach dropped as he looked up with eyes that weren't the unremarkable brown they'd been just a second before.
 The hot yellow eyes of a predator were looking out of James' familiar face, changing it into something threatening and inhuman.
 Answering growls from Jasmin and Jessica seemed to snap something inside of Alec.
 His tremble became more pronounced.
 There was a ripping sound, and when I looked down at his hands, they'd been replaced by the same wickedly-sharp claws I remembered from the night before.
 I must have let out a gasp, because Rachel tightened her grasp on me and moved closer.
 She might have whispered something comforting, but I couldn't hear it past the thunder of my own heartbeat.
 All three of them were moving towards us now.
 It was so inhumanly smooth and slow the motion was almost imperceptible, but I was certain they were stalking us.

I almost turned around and left when I saw the substitute again, but almost two decades of ingrained respect for authority figures propelled me into the room and to my seat.
 I happened to look up at the exact moment that Alec appeared in the doorway.
 I expected him to take one look at the sub and turn around like he'd done before, but he registered the presence of a substitute and then came inside regardless.
 It didn't make sense until the first girl all but fainted as he walked past her desk.
 Of course.
 He didn't like substitutes, and figured he had better places to be, but the draw of hero worship after having almost double-teamed Vincent was just too much to resist.
 The sub took a desultory roll, and then waved his hands at us.
 "Her notes say you're all supposed to be able to work on some kind of group project.
 Just keep it to a dull roar."
 It was like releasing a bunch of kids in a candy store and telling them to sample whatever they wanted.

I nodded and started towards the door, only to blink as Alec stepped in front of me.
 "May I have permission to enter and make sure it's safe inside?"
 I slowed down, suddenly terrified at the thought of Brandon and his friends waiting inside for me.
 "I thought you said you'd be able to smell them if they were here."
 "If they were outside, yes.
 Under normal circumstances we'd be able to determine whether or not they'd been here in the last few days, but the rainstorm last night was strong enough to wash away all of that."
 Alec waited patiently as I tried to get a grip on myself.
 As soon as I nodded he disappeared through the door.
 A few seconds later he was back.
 "It's safe; there's no trace of them."

From breakfast Monday until late Wednesday afternoon, all I had ingested were three beers and a Coke.
 Then I gobbled two jumbo hamburgers and spent the night consuming aspirins, with my head on two pillows because one alone felt hard as pavement.
 The next day, after Spanish class on Friday, I recounted my ordeal to Karen and explained that all my suffering certainly must have earned me her company at the movies.
 She congenially disagreed.
 While Eric and I drank bourbon and ginger ale, I griped about Karen.
 At first I acted tough and unruffled, but soon the bourbon took hold, and I confessed the pain in my gut that had nothing to do with fasting.
 He asked why I got so obsessed about Karen, knowing I never had pursued anybody else so boldly.
 Should anybody except Karen want a date with me, she had better tell her friend to pass the word along.
 I wouldn’t even ask any other girl for a dance without having already gotten the nod.
 Karen had pink, full lips and plenty of curves, and lively unhaunted eyes.

I shook my head, fighting the urge to look back down.
 "No, there isn't anything to be jealous of.
 I'd never been on a single date before Sanctuary, and you know all about what's happened since I arrived."
 His smile was surprisingly reassuring.
 "That sounds like the easiest one I've asked you yet.
 Why the sudden bashfulness?"
 My throat seemed to be spending an awful lot of the time lately constricted down to the point where speech was all but impossible.
 It was even worse than usual now.
 I thought maybe he'd have moved on to something else by the time I was able to talk again, but he was still patiently waiting when I managed to make myself look up again.
 It was tempting to lie and tell him I was just thinking about Cindi, the only one in the family who'd ever really had any luck in the dating department, but that wasn't fair.

They couldn’t even know that was what had happened until the others.
 Until the pattern became patent and they found the source.” I stared at Ruby, imagining the nameless “others” who’d been taken by her venom before they discovered its root.
 But it was not the idea of those strangers that tightened my chest.
 Poison.
 To her mother.
 Chapter Twelve Unexpected Company
 My dreams were wicked that night, all venom and wolves, snakes and beasts, death and fire.
 I woke in my bed, light filtering in through the window.
 The door was open a crack and I could see Chevelle sitting in the front room.
 I was hesitant to face him.

Harruq cut him again and again.
 His arms, his chest, his face: it all bled.
 But he remained alive, at least until that final moment when the two magic blades scissor-cut his neck.
 Harruq sheathed his swords and held the decapitated head of his foe high above him.
 Full of pride, Qurrah watched his brother roar his victory to the night sky.

I forget you're not aware of my special gift.
 I see inside people.
 Shape shifters really, but every once in a while normal humans as well.
 I can see their potential, and when they develop gifts, I can see the shape those gifts have taken."
 "Gifts?"
 "The most powerful of the Fir'shan, the hybrids as the younger generation calls them, occasionally develop unusual abilities.
 Alec's father's was that of being able to heal himself more rapidly than normal, even for our kind.
 Thanatas, the legendary king who defeated the southerners, was said to be able to mold his own body, making powerful changes that made him unbeatable in combat."
 Mallory's explanation was tickling the back of my mind.
 "Is that why Brandon's unbeatable?"

It was a weak explanation, but there was something in his voice that made me believe him.
 The few doubts I still had melted away as I finally met his eyes.
 I've always been pretty good at reading people, and I'd never seen anyone whose eyes conveyed that level of sincerity.
 My voice caught, and it took a couple of tries to get actual words out.
 "She'll come after me."
 Brandon shook his head.
 "I won't let her.
 That's part of why I wanted to talk to you.
 I won't let anyone do anything to you.
 Think of it as repayment."

Do you really believe I have that kind of willpower?"
 "After the things I've seen you go through I'd never doubt your willpower, Adri."
 It was rare that I suffered from a panic attack in Alec's presence but the reference to what I'd lost, combined with my dreaded nickname nearly did the trick.
 As my pulse sped up again Alec pulled me in close.
 "Sorry about that.
 You do have to admit, it would help explain why you're still here."
 "Right, gorgeous, rich boy who also happens to be the next best thing to a super hero.
 I must be out of my mind not to run for the hills."
 "You don't like it when I spend money on you and the more involved you get with me the less likely it is I'll be able to protect you."
 "If I let you buy me something will you quit trying to scare me off?"

There was a light rap on my door.
 I tried to sound sleepy.
 “Yes?” “Frey, I’m on my way to the ridge.
 We will be leaving in the morning.” Ruby’s words confused me.
 I must have read through the night.
 “Okay.” “Steed is here.
 You can stay with him or go with me.” “I’ll stay.” I listened to her footsteps recede.
 When I was sure she was gone I slipped the book into my pack and hid it inside the material of the white gown.
 We would be leaving tomorrow, traveling to the peak.
 I laughed to myself—no matter how many times I said it, I had no clue what it meant.

Inside he first tested out the plumbing, finding the experience both new and familiar.
 He also had a chance to examine his own plumbing, and was pleased with the results; his new body was large and powerfully built even in places that most people would not see.
 The only thing of use in the water closet was a shaving kit which Rodregas added to the trunk.
 Next he went to the study door only to find it locked.
 He looked for a key but there was nothing.
 He guessed that it was locked by magic and required a magic word or incantation to open the lock.
 He pushed and pulled on the door, but it was solidly made and there was nothing to get a good hold of to test his new strength.
 He looked around for something to use as a pry bar; next to the fireplace was a poker.
 He grabbed it and forced it into the crack were a normal door would have its catch.
 He got it wedged in good but then stopped and went over to the outside door and opening it, listened for anyone nearby before going back inside the room.

Man, everything was happening.
 I started to lose myself when I played, you know, and it was kind of frightening, where I’d go when I played.
 I wasn’t even aware of Skippy and Crafty, except as background thunder, a wall I was bouncing off of.
 And, like sex, I was gone, man.
 At first I almost blacked out, it was so intense, but you learn to control it, right?
 I mean, I learned to let myself soar, to let myself fall into it, to not be afraid.
 You step up to the edge of the cliff and you think—you think—you can fly, but you’re really not sure.
 It’s that first jump that’s scary.
 After that, it’s all magic—after that I knew who I was.

Harruq swung Condemnation left, deflecting the incoming thrust.
 His other blade stabbed, tearing away the soft flesh beneath his attacker’s ribcage.
 The elf leapt back, landed shakily, and then lunged once more.
 His speed was not what it should have been, though, and Harruq needed little opening.
 He swung both swords, the entirety of his might behind them.
 The elf blocked.
 His sword was elven-make and had been wielded in his hands for two hundred years.
 Never would he have guessed Harruq’s were older by three centuries.
 Never would he have guessed that those two blades would shatter his own, pass through the explosion of steel, sever his spine, and cleave his body in two.
 The half-orc continued his charge, engaging the two elves behind.

 “Wake up, Qurrah.”
 The half-orc lifted his eyelids to see the thoroughly unwelcoming sight of Velixar frowning down at him.
 “Yes, master?” he asked, puzzled, for it was still before dawn.
 He had slept no more than a few hours, he figured.
 “Who is it your brother travels with now?” Velixar asked.
 “You say he has abandoned you, but to whom?”
 “An elf named Aurelia,” Qurrah said as he sat up.

No one generally went out of their way to speak to me, but I didn’t want to take any chances.
 The other elves didn’t have much use for one who wasn’t able to contribute.
 My lack of magic and skill had put me far from their minds.
 Except in the case of Evelyn, who sought to raise herself by lowering me, but always with such a thick coating of sweetness.
 And it didn’t help that I couldn’t pull off the polish or cheer of the other elves.
 I slipped around the village and through Junnie’s back yard, darting past a trellis toward the door.
 As I ducked under the hanging ivy, I caught my foot on a vine and stumbled forward, cursing as I nearly ran into a boulder.
 A boulder wearing a shirt.
 Gradually, my head tilted upward, and I blew my too-long bangs aside to peer up first at a strong chin, stern mouth, and then the darkest, deepest sapphire eyes I’d ever seen.
 Sure, lots of elves had blue eyes, but bright and shimmery.

Few have been able to ignite the aspiration for continuous learning and the capacity for original creativity that are the most profound characteristics of human consciousness.
 Measured in these terms, even the most developed nations still have a long way to go and much that can be done to further the development of their people.
 To sum up, 10 years ago when we presented the report of the International Commission on Peace and Food, we were optimistic that humankind will grasp the uncommon opportunities provided by democratic systems of governance and technological and knowledge revolutions for achieving a world without hunger and where every individual has an opportunity for a productive and healthy life.
 The onward march of technology is still in full swing, but the political commitment to foster cooperative human security worldwide is yet to emerge.
 The Information Age has given meaning and content to the concept of a global village.
 The threats associated with climate change and biodiversity loss also underline the fact that while humankind may be segregated by political frontiers, our fates are intertwined ecologically.
 Economically also, islands of prosperity cannot co-exist forever in the midst of oceans of poverty.
 Both unsustainable lifestyles and unacceptable poverty must become features of the past, if we are to curb the growing violence in the human heart.
 Ten years after presentation of our report, we remain convinced that universal health, harmony and happiness are still within our reach, if only we imbibe the eternal truth contained in the following message of Lord Krishna delivered on the battlefield of life called Kurukshetra:
 We human beings can become whatever we sincerely aspire to become.

Donovan had been waiting in the hall just outside Alec's room.
 He'd pressed objects into Dom and Jasmin's hands, and then brushed his lips across the back of my hand.
 He slipped away, and then we'd entered a brightly-lit room filled with the rest of the pack.
 Alec had picked me up and carried me out to a massive SUV that I'd never seen before.
 Everyone piled in, and despite the seriousness of rapidly approaching events, I fell back asleep somewhere en route to our destination.
 Apparently you couldn't drive all the way though, because we were walking again, or at least some of us were.
 I could just make out Isaac off a little ways into the darkness.
 He was in hybrid form and moving with a ground-devouring gait that was deceptively smooth.
 Flashes of movement off to either side of us, lower to the ground, made me sure the girls were all following along on four legs.
 Alec shifted me around as he realized I was awake.

Meet us out back after this crap is over and we'll give you a real show."
 My mouth dropped open in shock.
 Nothing was going to get them to shut up now, not when they had such a perfect target.
 Sitting there staring at them was about the worst of all the choices open to me, but I was too shocked to pull my eyes away.
 I felt a surge of heat rush through me as the room wavered slightly.
 For a second I worried I was going to pass out, but movement behind the two punks distracted me from my heaving internal landscape.
 There was just enough light for me to see Alec lean forward and put a hand on each troublemaker's shoulder.
 There was an abortive movement by the two loudmouths, as they tried to spin around and confront him.
 Granted, the lighting was less than ideal, but it didn't look like Alec was holding onto them very hard.
 Still, neither of them made it more than a quarter of the way around before being slammed back down into their chairs.

My ears had begun to buzz, not the all-out siren that had crippled me before, but a constant, crackling hum.
 I worked my jaw, tugged at the lobe of my ear.
 The stranger’s lips moved, apparently able to speak again, and Anvil approached him, dwarfing the captive with his mass.
 Anvil exhibited remarkable menace when he addressed the frozen councilman, who mouthed another reply.
 Through ringing ears I couldn’t decipher their words, but somehow I did hear the breaking bones.
 A grotesque crunch accompanied the snapping of the councilman’s thigh, and he dropped nearly to the ground.
 Anvil leaned over him, somehow even more intimidating as he spoke directly to the man, as if they were the only two here, as if he hadn’t just suffered a traumatic injury.
 And, evidently, Anvil didn’t like the answers he received, because the councilman’s other leg snapped, dropping him to rest on the stumps of his broken, mangled thighs.
 I should have turned at the sight, but I couldn’t keep from wondering how it was possible he remained upright at all.
 Anvil bent down to keep his stare close, threatening, and the broken man looked at me.

I quickened my pace, caught my toe on a root, and stumbled.
 As soon as I righted myself, I wasn’t able to stop myself from peeking back to see if he had noticed, but he was gone.
 I didn’t know if I was relieved.
 My mind went over the encounter again as I made my way home.
 Did he always wear such a stern expression?
 Why was he looking at me so intensely?
 But I had my answer: Because you keep staring at him, fool.
 It seemed to me Fannie always knew when I didn’t want to be bothered and went out of her way to ensure I was.
 I quietly entered the house, hoping to slip right into my room, but there she was, smack in the center of the sitting area, drunk as a two-day jamboree.
 She stopped me on my way through and forced me to sit, her audience.

 The tears began flowing faster down her cheeks.
 "But I don't belong here.

 Rick stared at her, his throat thick and sore.

 "Yes--no."

We are poised at what can become a turning point in the role of war in human affairs.
 The momentous consequences at stake call for decisive action.
 Historically, war has been a means of territorial expansion and economic conquest that strengthened and enriched the conqueror while draining the energy and diminishing the wealth of the conquered.
 War and economic development co-existed and sometimes complemented each other.
 Technological progress increased defensive and offensive capabilities.
 The demands of war and the associated destruction stimulated greater economic activity and spurred organizational innovation, especially for the benefit of those not directly engaged in the conflict.
 Guns were one of the first products of mass production.
 In the modern era, society has become the principle target and victim of war.
 With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, technology and economic activity in support of fighting forces became an increasingly significant factor.
 As a result, more and more effort was directed at eliminating or crippling the enemy’s economic and industrial capacity and the ‘national will’ to wage war.

Even I knew it was wasted effort.
 If Mom somehow beat the odds, it still wasn't going to result in the kind of money we'd need to save our house.
 Not in the next two or three weeks at least.
 It felt like my whole world had just disappeared down a drain.
 I didn't suffer any real panic attacks, but more or less spent both days in a kind of despondency that wasn't much better than a full-blown attack.
 By the time Monday morning arrived I had vague memories of doing homework and not much else.
 The only positive from the whole weekend was the way my dream from Friday stayed with me.
 As I got ready for school I idly wondered if it would be possible to recreate the grotto in real life.
 Obviously not with the impossible, glowing water, but with the incredible, lush vegetation and the secluded pool.
 Then again, I'd seen Mom pull off some pretty crazy tricks with her camera, maybe there would be some way to simulate glowing water, some kind of photography trick I'd never heard of.

 The two brothers were almost to the wall when the skulls flew overhead.
 “Make them stop!” cried Harruq Tun, hands pressed against his ears.
 Beside him, Qurrah Tun stood mesmerized by the sight.
 Hundreds of skulls bathed in purple fire sailed over the walls of Veldaren like dark comets.

I imagined he didn’t want me to hear them.
 Paranoia, my mind accused.
 I heard the front door close as I flopped onto the bed, only to jolt upright when Ruby’s door opened a few seconds later.
 It was Chevelle.
 My courage was gone again.
 He seemed to be waiting for me to speak.
 I tried, “I’m sorry I interrupted…” He nodded, but I didn’t know if he was acknowledging my interruption or pardoning it.
 He walked slowly toward the bed, glancing at Ruby’s things on the shelves and walls, and then sat on the bed beside me.
 I forced myself to continue breathing and kept my gaze down, knowing a flush was coming.
 He reached out and placed a hand under my chin, bringing my face up to meet his.

It felt similar to my own, though I could tell he had more power, more confidence.
 I pulled back and experimented with each of the other horses.
 Anvil’s seemed slower, fatigued.
 The others were about the same, though I noticed Chevelle’s horse was more skittish.
 I was sure Steed had done that on purpose.
 “Frey?” Ruby was talking to me.
 I pretended I’d been alert.
 “Yeah?” I hadn’t fooled her.
 “Doing okay?” “Uh-huh.” I decided to take the opportunity; I had a dozen questions since reading the diary.
 “Hey, Ruby, are there any castles around here?” The caravan stopped as everyone turned to stare at me.

"Hmmm?
 Oh, nothing.
 When do you think you'll get married?"
 "I don't know.
 I'll leave that up to Carolyn after I propose.
 Mother, I'd like to invite her over for dinner tonight if that's all right.
 I'd like for her and Marie to get to know each other better."
 "Why don't we wait until tomorrow?
 I think we should give Marie a chance to rest and readjust."
 "I'm fine."

Everything was done in drab, painfully boring colors, overlaid with incredibly vibrant, hues that were almost unreal in their perfection.
 It wasn't until I'd moved around a corner and entered what looked like a new phase for the painter that I figured out why the paintings looked so familiar despite the fact that I'd never seen any of the places or people depicted.
 The realization hit with such force that it distracted me from the familiarity of the signature.
 The new pieces were all breathtaking.
 The drab colors were gone, leaving scenes made up of multi-hued strands of light.
 It was like waking up and having someone tell you they'd been reading your mind.
 The pieces weren't of specific places or events from my dreams, but they were an exact match for how they'd looked and felt.
 I felt my hands start to shake.
 It was like I'd had too much forced on me too quickly.
 I wanted to just collapse and let unconsciousness overcome me, but something pulled me onward towards the next series of pictures, and then the next after that.

Fire danced from her fingertips and twisted towards the troll and frost beast.
 The beast breathed and ice sprayed from its mouth.
 Emily moved her hand over and the ice evaporated into mist.
 She was holding up fine but I didn’t know how much longer.
 I strung my bow and released an arrow.
 It pierced the frost beast’s pelt and it fell to the ground.
 Emily turned to me with huge, confused eyes.
 She mouthed the words, thank you.
 I nodded in response.
 Jason threw his knife at the troll and it landed in its leg.

She hugged Marie.
 "Go on up to your room and take a nap."
 "No--let's go back to the living room."
 "Aren't you tired?"
 "A little.
 I didn't get much sleep last night.
 But I'd rather talk."
 "All right."
 Arm in arm they returned to the living room and sat on the sofa.
 "Can you tell me anything about what happened, darling?

Armani, Versace, Prada, we conducted a tour de force of them all along with others whose names I didn't even recognize.
 The shopping trip was ostensibly for me, but Rachel cajoled both Jasmin and Dominic into dressing rooms on more than one occasion.
 Amazingly enough, everything she picked out for them fit so perfectly that I began to agree with them that there wasn't much point in even trying anything on.
 The first store we stopped at didn't take us seriously until Rachel pulled out a black American Express, after which every sales person in the entire place lined up to assist us.
 Once we each sported a bag or two from some ridiculously over-priced store, things went much more smoothly.
 I tried on a variety of jeans, blouses, shirts, skirts, dresses, and just about every other article of clothing imaginable.
 I drew the line at a swimsuit, since there was no way on earth I'd ever wear one, and then felt so bad at how crushed Rachel was that I let her drag me into a store full of formals.
 It was a mistake because I soon found myself being zipped into a delicate, green dress that I was absolutely positive wasn't going to survive the experience of trying to wrap itself around me.
 "Oh, it's perfect, Adri.
 We have to get it."

I made it to Brandon's table, and was still pulling my meal replacement drink out of my bag when the loudspeaker clicked on with the obligatory burst of static.
 "This is Principal Gossil and I've got an exciting announcement.
 The school is sponsoring a trip to Las Vegas to see the production of Les Misérables that just started.
 Tickets are available at a discounted rate in the office for the next two days."
 It was like someone had rifled through my mind to pick out my biggest disappointment in recent days, pulled it out and rubbed salt on the wound before cramming it back inside me.
 Of course I'd go see how big of a discount the school had gotten the tickets at, but it was extremely unlikely my tiny check would end up being enough.
 It took me a moment to realize Mr. Gossil hadn't ended his announcement.
 "...those wishing to be entered into the drawing should stop by the office between today and noon tomorrow."
 In the face of the near-universal apathy expressed by the rest of the student body, it took my mind several seconds to process exactly what had been said.
 I grabbed Brandon's arm and shook it to get his attention.

Others believe the Sun's children marred the face of the Earth, and that when she refused to discipline her wayward family, the Earth swore in his wrath to destroy them."
 Alec adjusted his pillow and continued.
 "Whatever the cause, it's commonly held that this was the point at which the Earth ceased to be a paradise.
 Bountiful gardens were replaced by weeds and thorns.
 Hurt and betrayed, the Sun distanced herself from the Earth, lessening the number of life-giving rays warming his surface.
 Possibly that was his plan.
 If she'd totally abandoned him then her children would've all died."
 I felt my eyelids begin to flutter, as my breathing slowed to match Alec's.
 "Whether that was his intent or not, the Sun didn't completely abandon him, either out of respect for what they'd shared, or possibly out of concern for her children.
 Once it became apparent that the Earth and Sun were through with each other, the Moon began to court her.

But the moment would pass, and he would turn back to gawk at the tube until Sylvia ordered him to fetch her cigarettes, or made him stand still while she straightened his tie, or checked to see that he had zipped all the way.
 Observing them made us recommit ourselves to becoming supermen.
 One Friday night, I arrived just as they were leaving for a jazz club.
 Before climbing into Richard’s car, Sylvia commanded me, “If you brought any liquor, Kenneth, go away.” I agreed and waited until they drove off before scooping a pint of bourbon and a bottle of ginger ale out of my Chevrolet’s trunk.
 I wanted to get numb.
 For about the tenth time, Karen Flagstad had rejected me, even though a few days before I had warned her that if she wouldn’t join me at a movie that weekend, I would fast until death.
 From breakfast Monday until late Wednesday afternoon, all I had ingested were three beers and a Coke.
 Then I gobbled two jumbo hamburgers and spent the night consuming aspirins, with my head on two pillows because one alone felt hard as pavement.
 The next day, after Spanish class on Friday, I recounted my ordeal to Karen and explained that all my suffering certainly must have earned me her company at the movies.
 She congenially disagreed.

He struggled to lift a single numb hand, then flopped it down on top of the dead elf’s leg.
 Qurrah took as deep a breath as he dared and then spoke the words of a spell.
 Each syllable was slow torture, garbled in blood and born of pain most horrid.
 Thankfully, the spell was not complicated, and the words were few.
 He finished the spell mere seconds before his mind succumbed to the sleep that crawled at his eyes.
 Even though he was dead, life energy still swirled inside the elf’s body.
 Normally this energy would be consumed by the earth in burial, but Qurrah had other plans.
 His spell took in this life energy through his hand, filling his body with it, healing his wounds and clearing his mind.
 The darkness fighting for control in his head subsided, a shred of strength returning to his limbs.
 There was still the slight problem of the arrow lodged in his throat.

"`Sweetheart'?
 Why?"
 "I'm betrothed to Davis."
 His heart constricted.
 "Are you missing him?"
 "He's my betrothed.
 Shouldn't I be missing him?"
 She burst into tears.
 Rick felt awful, but he didn't know if he felt worse for himself or for her.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he told her, scooting closer and putting his arms around her tentatively.

"How could I be?
 I never even thought I'd get to go!
 Thank you so much, Rick."
 She jumped up to kiss his cheek again.
 Marie couldn't sleep that night.
 She was going to Hollywood!
 She wouldn't be able to see Mary Pickford or Douglas Fairbanks, but maybe she'd see some of her new favorites, like Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts.
 She managed to doze a little but was wide awake before dawn.
 Deciding to do an aerobics tape until it was light enough to walk in the garden, she put on her workout clothes and went downstairs.
 She didn't know how she was going to be able to wait two entire days.

Her knuckles went white, and her breathing sped up.
 I knew if she sprang at me, I was going to get really hurt.
 When Brandon's hand appeared on Cassie's shoulder to restrain her, I thought for a second my knees would buckle.
 A few seconds later, it was as if nothing had ever happened.
 The ring of spectators dissolved as kids quickly returned to their tables.
 Brandon and his friends left through one set of cafeteria doors, while Alec and his friends departed through the other.
 Britney looked like she was trying to decide whether to be mad or impressed, but I felt too sick to stick around and try to nudge her in either direction.
 I mumbled something I hoped sounded intelligible and headed towards the bathroom.
 I passed Mr. Simms and another teacher on my way out, but apparently I looked as awful as I felt.
 They just shot me stern looks rather than stopping me to ask what had happened.

Alec crossed over to me and ran a finger down the side of my face.
 "Only you could manage to make a joke out of having fallen in with monsters."
 I shrugged.
 "What else is a girl to do?"
 Alec's reply shrug mirrored mine exactly and yet still turned the movement into something far more graceful and eloquent than what I'd managed.
 "Be that as it may, I think you don't give yourself enough credit for just how amazing you are."
 I felt myself start to blush as Alec disappeared into the bathroom.
 ** Monsters I could handle, motorcycles were something else entirely.
 I'd almost backed out when Alec told me we'd be taking his bullet bike, but I didn't want him to know I really was a complete wuss.
 All of which explained how I'd ended up on Alec's shiny, blue Yamaha R1 with my arms locked around him in a death grip.

The battle was at a standstill, all because of this mysterious stranger who walked so calmly down the street.
 “Men of Neldar!” this man screamed, sounding like a giant among mortal humans.
 “Some of you are meant to die this day.
 Rejoice, for your souls will leave this mortal coil in the glory of combat.
 Raise high your swords, and slay the elves that seek your death.
 Fight without pain, and slaughter without mercy.
 I have given them fear, and the battle is yours for the taking!”
 The shield shook, power flared throughout, and then it exploded outward.
 The wooden shutters on the buildings shattered into splinters.
 The sides of homes rocked as if hit by the winds of a hurricane.

The first essential step in that direction is a commitment by market economies to guarantee the right of every citizen to employment.
 Neither the mechanism of state planning and control nor the mechanism of market prices can accomplish this on their own.
 A blending of their values and methods – freed from the blinkers of dogma and the determinism of limited imagination – can lead us to the answer.
 Wider Perspective on Transitions
 The outcome of all great social transformations – of which the present instance ranks in magnitude and importance with that of the French Revolution and the movement which freed India and so many other former colonies from imperialism, economic exploitation and cultural domination – depends on the degree to which individuals and institutions within the society have been prepared to understand, accept and respond to the new environment ushered in by the transition.
 Two hundred years ago the people of France were ready to overthrow the old order but ill-prepared to create anything new, with the result that the old soon re-established itself and lived on for another century.
 It took India’s leaders more than four decades to prepare their people for freedom and it has taken another four to overcome the vestiges of colonial rule that prevented the country from releasing its energies for prosperity.
 Long after the foreign conquerors had left, colonialism lived on in the institutions of government and in the attitudes of the population.
 Decades of freedom and education were needed for the country to outgrow a sense of inferiority, a seeking for security, a feeling of submissiveness and complacency, and to acquire a sense of pride, ambition, high aspirations and expectations, a seeking for achievement, and a spirit of adventure and enterprise – and still the task is not complete.
 Development is like a chemical reaction that is determined by the variety and quantity of elements present and the conditions under which they are put together.

It didn't seem fair for things to cool off now when it was so inconvenient after so many weeks of oppressive heat.
 I was still musing over the injustice of it all when Alec shifted me around so I was held in just one arm.
 "There's something I'd like you to have.
 Something I hope will help you remember what you mean to me..." He trailed off, and then seemingly at a loss for words, reached out and lifted the black velvet that'd been covering the painting.
 Another graceful gesture flipped on the set of soft lights surrounding its border.
 As always with Alec's paintings, it took me a second before I could shift my perspective enough to translate the beautiful formations of light into something I could tie to the drab, dreary world I inhabited.
 It was the same grotto where we now stood.
 The warm glow from the climbing ivory and roses formed a backdrop awash in the silvery light of a full moon.
 Just visible off to one side was the pool, alive with enough microscopic life to give it a pale glow of its own to compliment the off-center reflection of a hundred tiny lights.
 A few seconds later I finally recognized that the subject of the piece was a female, reaching out towards the point of view with glowing hands.

There’s a lot more fellow-feeling among musicians.
 So, Christ, what was my point?
 We were playing these gigs, getting bigger, getting a rep.
 This was the end of the sixties.
 There was talk of a concert in upstate New York that was gonna blow everybody away.
 And we had just signed on with Pete Holder, who was both lawyer and agent.
 Well, Pete said, he thought he could get us in on this New York concert.
 He was talking to Bill Graham, who was bringing in some new acts, one of which, I remember was Cocker, who nobody knew.
 And Graham was kind of holding the proceedings hostage, making demands, etc.
 And Lennon was going to play, they said, but Hoover, that bastard,  was keeping him out of the states, and, anyway there was all this legal maneuvering going on, and, somehow, it just never happened.

Your mom seems like a very sensible person."
 I almost choked.
 "I love my mom, but she's the least sensible person ever.
 She spends half of her time in a different universe entirely, and only occasionally worries about the same kinds of things as other parents."
 "Ah, a dreamer, but one who still freaks out when it comes to her daughter and boys.
 Maybe she was just struck by my obvious good nature."
 I shook my head as we pulled into the parking lot.
 "Please.
 You're just about everything she's worried about in a guy.

I think that last part bothers me the most, but I find myself doing so nevertheless.
 Make sure you wait at least half an hour.
 There's a definite element of danger to all of this."
 ** I must have checked the clock sixteen times during the last five minutes of the obligatory half-hour.
 The sensible, grownup part of me was arguing for another five minutes just to make sure, but I told that part to take a flying leap and all but ran through the house looking for Donovan.
 "Yes, mistress?
 Do you need something?"
 "Donovan, Alec said I could go watch them work out.
 Will you take me to wherever they are?"
 He dried his hands on a blisteringly white towel, and nodded.

He'd thought he'd been in control of his world until Marie had disappeared.
 He would have given that world to have her back.
 Marie pulled back a bit when she heard her father sniff.
 "Father, I've never seen you cry!"
 she said, laughing with happiness and relief.
 "I've never before lost you for five weeks and three days."
 She turned to put her arms around him.
 "I love you, Father."
 "I love you too, darling.
 Where have you been?"

From the beginning of 1990 to March 1992, registered unemployment grew from 100,000 to over 4 million and it has continued to rise steeply since then.
 The unemployment rate for ten Eastern European countries now averages around 17 per cent.
 Recent projections indicate that jobless ness in Russia could reach 15 million persons or 18 per cent of the work-force in the near future.
 By far the most serious problem lies in the developing world, where unemployment rates average 40–50 per cent in many countries.
 In Latin America, 192 million people representing 46 per cent of the population live under the poverty line, and 22 per cent of them are considered ‘extremely poor’.
 Urban unemployment is around 8 per cent, but average industrial wages in the region fell by 17.5 per cent during the 1980s and the number of workers in the lower-wage informal sector doubled.
 Although population growth has slowed, a 72 per cent increase in labour participation rates for women is causing the work force to continue to expand rapidly.
 This region needs to double its employment growth rate to create 89 million new jobs during the 1990s in order to provide full employment opportunities for all its people.
 In sub-Saharan Africa, home to 20 of the 25 poorest nations in the world, urban unemployment afflicts some 14 million people, representing 15–20 per cent of the workforce, and is projected to more than double in the next ten years.
 Typically, youth comprise 65 to 75 per cent of the total unemployed.

 Errrr, when I get it, how will I contact you and let you know?
 Cindy:  Oh yeah, well you could call me, and we could meet.
 Greg:  what’s your phone number?
 Cindy:  One moment (writes it down and hands it to him).
 Greg:  Thanks, I’ll get right on this.

Marie closed her eyes, drawing strength from Rick.
 She just hoped he was right.
 And she hoped it would happen soon.
 After Rick had left for work, Marie walked on the treadmill for nearly 45 minutes and then made herself a cup of tea.
 Rested, she opened the box containing the exercise movie Rick had gotten her and with delight put it into the BCR.
 No--VCR, she corrected herself.
 She got so involved in the exercises and then exploring the house that she'd only watched one of the movies--"Gone with the Wind," which made her laugh sometimes and cry sometimes and held her spellbound the entire time--by 5:30, when Rick got home from work.
 “Would you like me to get you some more movies for tomorrow?” Rick asked Marie as they prepared dinner together.
 “I still have that other one to watch.
 ‘Casablanca.’”  She handed him the green peppers she’d just chopped.

"I haven't done anything to you, Cassie, and you know it.
 This is all just an excuse."
 I looked around for teachers, but they were still conspicuously absent.
 There wasn't time.
 Even if they arrived right now, someone was probably going to get hurt.
 Cassie tossed her hair and smiled, a plastic expression that bordered on a smirk.
 "Shut your lying mouth.
 I'm really going to enjoy this."
 Britney had positioned herself so she could see Brandon.
 As a consequence, I could see Alec's entire group, and I was amazed by their reaction to Cassie's belligerence.

We were in a clearing and I could see the sky clearly.
 Dark clouds covered the sky and a rumble shook the air again.
 A single drop of water landed on my cheek.
 “Oh no,” I breathed.
 Another drop landed on my forehead and then on my chin.
 Then they started to pick up speed and I covered my face with my hands.
 The rain streaked through my hair, soaking it to my head.
 Seth looked extremely annoyed as he stood there, his blue hair plastered to his face.
 His eyes were half covered by his hair and his eyes locked onto mine.
 He rolled his eyes and looked away.

Anything, no matter how trivial, signal the wolves.” Wolves.
 They had been wolves, not dogs.
 I immediately had more respect for the tall, pale-haired elves.
 Men who tamed wild wolves.
 We were back at the house in what seemed like a heartbeat.
 Steed watched the village from the front room.
 Ruby sat with me on her bed, the door closed.
 “This will calm you,” she said.
 A sprinkle of glitter hit my face before I had the chance to protest.
 “Just a touch,” she assured me, “just a touch.” It was too late.

Sometime before dark I left and wandered alone, toward and up a hill called Eastridge that overlooked our school, along a street of vacant lots, sometimes escaping into in my usual obsessions about Karen Flagstad or whether I should play baseball or golf that spring.
 But after a moment, the truth returned.
 Nothing that mattered yesterday mattered anymore.
 My gut felt as if a big snake were coiled inside it.
 My heart was a huge lump of coal.
 I walked faster and groaned and wondered why I couldn’t weep.
 I thought of how Eric was ten times the human I would ever be.
 If he couldn’t become Superman, I estimated my chances equaled about the square root of zero.
 Mystery
 All these years, I have believed that in some vaguely Christ-like way, Eric died as a sacrifice.

I took a steadying breath and spat out, “No.” They stared at me, incredulous.
 I spoke deliberately.
 “She is elf.
 I name her… Elfreda.”
 My heart had stopped.
 And then it surged as blood rushed to my face, my neck.
 My ears rang.
 I must have been speaking or cursing.
 I could hear the sound, but could not make sense of it.
 Nothing made sense.

I guess that time, it was the comfort motive.” “Did it work?” she asked.
 “Sure, gradually.
 And then, another time, when I decided to actually find a church I would go to more than once or twice, was on account of feeling quite blessed and knowing I ought to be spending more time thanking God than I ever would on my own.” “How did you know which church to pick?” Such a question calls for more coffee.
 I pour a cup and say, “Well, the evangelical ones were where I found more people who actually tried to get closer to God.
 You know, to better understand God through all kinds of means.
 Intellect and others.
 I mean, I’m all for preachers showing how Biblical advise can help us be nicer, more prosperous, more benevolent, more likely to work toward human rights and all.
 But without the honest search for connection with the Holy Spirit, none of that good advice carries much weight.”
 Eric vs. Max Von Sydow
 Back on the road my thoughts pick up where they left off in San Luis Obispo, and I wonder if Brother Lawrence perceived his constant companion as the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit.

I wasn’t sure how to answer.
 But if it helped, if there was a way to unbind me, free my mind and get back the magic… I settled on a, “Mm-hm?” He nearly smiled.
 “Well, if you were able to… move about…” It seemed to make him uncomfortable, searching for words.
 “Then perhaps you could find a way around it.” I bit my lip and he reached up to gently pull it loose.
 His hand lingered, thumb tracing my bottom lip.
 I was definitely not imagining that.
 Warmth flooded my neck, my cheeks, and his gaze followed the flush.
 His hand dropped to my shoulder.
 “Please, Freya, try.” All I could do was nod.
 And then he stood and walked away.

Every right is accompanied by a responsibility.
 A government that fosters external aggression or cannot contain domestic violence and civil strife, that cannot create conditions in which its people can feed themselves or even receive outside assistance, fails the test of sovereignty.
 Under these circumstances, the international community, through the UN, should have the right and accept the responsi bility to intervene appropriately.
 The need of the hour is not to undermine the legitimate right of nations to self-determination, but rather to protect that right by more clearly demarcating its legitimate boundaries against the highly visible challenges being posed by forces of disintegration and fragmentation from within.
 The current tendency for states to fragment along ethnic lines cannot be handled by any abstract principle of international law.
 It depends on the understanding and will of people.
 The evolution of larger, heterogeneous national units functioning under principles of equality is an outstanding product of civilization that should not and cannot be reversed without great damage to the general welfare of humanity.
 The only solution is to work constantly to educate the public in all countries to understand the benefits of national integration and international cooperation.
 The implications of this view will be endorsed by some and opposed by others.
 Acceptance must be fostered through education and discussion rather than unilateral forced initiative.

There can be no victors in a nuclear war and there is no credible defence against these weapons.
 Confidential studies by NATO in the 1960s concluded that the costs of a nuclear exchange to either party would be so great that the weapons were essentially unusable.
 No satisfactory answer has ever emerged for the question: where and under what circumstances can these weapons be deployed beneficially?
 The continued expansion of nuclear stockpiles over three decades may have added to the self-importance of the military and political leaderships, and perhaps of the general public, in states that possessed them, but there is little evidence that it ever added to national security.
 The unusability of these weapons helps to explain why predictions of rapid spread of these weapons to other states proved to be so wildly exaggerated.
 The irrelevance or unusability of nuclear weapons is evident in all the wars involving major powers during the past four decades.
 A greater understanding of the environmental impact of these weapons has further strengthened the perception of unusability.
 It is time that psychological posturing gave way to a mature recognition that these weapons have no place in the civilized world and must be banished from it.
 The continued build-up of nuclear arsenals was an attempt by the superpowers to maintain parity or superiority over each other as a deterrent against being attacked.
 Although the nuclear powers may argue that their arsenals have protected them from any such danger, there is little rationality in a strategy that compelled adversaries continuously to take steps to offset each other’s measures, without either party actually achieving greater real security.

 "Do you want to leave?

 Shivers worked their way down my spine as some of the pieces clicked into place.

 "You mean a monster?
 Yes, we both feel the call of the moon.

The stone around the door was the gray of the local granite.
 The three others had black featureless stone that Rodregas did not recognize.
 As he followed Doi’van into the shadows of the distant arch Rodregas smelled what had attracted Doi’van, the odor of brimstone and hellfire.
 Rodregas stepped back in shock; what was that smell of the Infernal Realm doing here in the Cathedral of the Heavens?
 Doi’van however, did not step back but stepped forward, reaching out to the stone.
 When he touched it, suddenly there was a doorway.
 It was the twin of the main entrance, except here there were no guards.
 Doi’van reached for the long handle, but Rodregas quickly said, “Stop!” Doi’van looked back at him and Rodregas could see that he was under no magical geis controlling his will, just curiosity of what the source of the Infernal smell was down here.
 But what Doi’van said to him was, “Where is Imeralda?” At these words Rodregas whirled around and looked around throughout the great chamber.
 Both of their eyes were drawn to where they heard a third door being opened.

He relished the feel, knowing that one day he would speak the words in such a manner.
 Velixar lifted his hands to the sky, shouting out the last of the spell.
 The final command came shrieking forth from his lips.
 “ _Rise!_ ”
 In the distance, dark shapes rose from the grass.
 Four hundred bodies of men and elves marched silently away from town, back toward their master.
 Qurrah smiled.
 The macabre sight was beautiful.
 “What shall you do with them?” he asked.
 “They will join my army.

The silver-haired elves and their dogs were nowhere in sight.
 My gaze caught Steed, who was watching me.
 I always forgot how strikingly handsome he was until I looked right at him.
 He wore a thin, loose shirt now, rolled at the sleeves and covered by a leather vest.
 It matched the long cuffs on his forearms, the same dark, worn leather of his saddles.
 He stepped closer, taking my chin in his hand to examine my face in the moonlight.
 He purred something toward Ruby about her decorations and gave me a wink as he walked off in the direction Chevelle had gone.
 We were alone then, Ruby and I, and I was sure this was going to hurt more than my other training.
 She untied her cloak and tossed it to land with a muffled sound on the rocks.
 She was smiling a touch as she reached a hand across her waist, closing her fist around a black hoop I’d not seen before.

This was almost how she'd felt when she'd wandered into 2011.
 But then she'd been in a strange place; now she was home.
 She should be ecstatic.
 She'd tried for over five weeks to get home.
 Tuesday she'd spent a delightful day with her family, the best of her adult life.
 Her father had amazed her by showing her his love in a variety of ways.
 He and her brother had reconciled.
 She'd had several of the heart-to-heart talks with her mother that she'd longed for.
 She should be happier than she had ever been in her life.

What sort of weapon did you have in mind?” Her smile widened.
 Her hand stretched out to the side and a long, silver sword came from the pile of gear to land in her palm.
 She righted it, twisting the blade for me to see.
 My stomach dropped.
 “There are a few things you need to remember when using a blade,” she instructed.
 “First of all, always go for the fatal attack.
 If you merely wound someone, well, someone with magic will use the last of their power to stop you.
 Cut off their head or puncture the lung and heart.
 Never mess around.” I imagined myself decapitating someone.
 I laughed as I realized my mind placed Fannie there.

Gaining such sigils was outlawed by the guide except for their own warriors, but the Order of the Soaring Heavens was also the traditional sources for the Gods own Paladins, and even the Celestial Guild had never dared to anger the gods by interfering with their use of sigils.
 Rigoria had been one of the greatest of the Order of the Soaring Heavens, but he had grown old and his health had failed him.
 When tempted by the Immortalists with a new body, he had accepted.
 Even though such action was anathema to the very teachings of the Order, he had become an officer of the Immortal Guards, and eventually their leader.
 Several of the most powerful Knights had over the centuries, formed the officer core of The Immortal Guards.
 These Knights traded their honor for near immortality in the Guards.
 The Immortal Guards were all sigil warriors with one or several magical enhancements.
 They also had the best resources of the entire Eastern Realm, the most powerful enchanted armor, the best weapons; their officers rode Dire Beasts for steeds.
 Taking on a sigil warrior would be a huge challenge for Rodregas, or at least he thought it would be.
 He was still unclear of how strong and fast he was.

Jim – You’ve never said that.
 Johnny – Ok so maybe I didn’t actually say it, but I thought it really loud a bunch of times.
 Not my fault if you fools can’t read my mind.
 Jim – Maybe you should think louder.
 That’s assuming that you have something there to read.
 Johnny – Any ideas I have will no doubt be superior to the Canadian Change theory.
 Eugene – Oh not that again.
 What caused the return that small piece of delusional fantasy?
 It was funny the first time, but it’s lost some of its charm in each re-telling.
 Jim – It’s not fantasy damn it.

 “Don’t worry about it, Frey.” I wondered if I’d looked frightened.

 I meant to smile at him, but only succeeded in pressing my lips into a flat line.
 “Rest now.
 There is plenty of time for tr—” He thought better of saying training again, finishing, “To test the bindings.” He smiled at me and, once again, I thought for a heartbeat he might reach out to me.
 But he did not.
 He simply stood and walked from the room.
 Ruby saw me watching.

Many hot-rodders did drugs and many of us sold drugs (usually to the jocks).
 It was the days of cocaine and pot, and I saw and consumed my share of it.
 Thomas became one of the bigger drug dealers in town.
 His house was filled with booze and drugs of all types.
 Cocaine was the most popular, that, and pot; but magic mushrooms and acid were also available.
 It was the late seventies, after all.
 We were also surrounded by some pretty tough guys and nobody really messed with us.
 After years of sparring with a two hundred pound Greek, I was pretty tough myself.
 We would host evening boxing matches in the living room of the house I rented with my friends.
 We had no furniture in that room.

While it is clear that these new democracies have rejected the authoritarian statist system, it is not yet clear what finally they will accept, discover or invent as a more acceptable alternative.
 The creativity and inventiveness they have exhibited in seeking an alternative in the past may quite possibly lead them to discover that better social system which both East and West are in need of.
 Viewed from an evolutionary perspective, we may surmise the general direction and likely destination of that quest.
 The requirements of the state and the market must eventually give way to the needs of people.
 The values of authority and money must be supplanted by acceptance of the fundamental value of the human being.
 Human welfare and well-being must become the central determinants of social policy, in place of the compulsions of the centrally controlled state bureaucracy and the decentralized market pricing mechanism.
 The first essential step in that direction is a commitment by market economies to guarantee the right of every citizen to employment.
 Neither the mechanism of state planning and control nor the mechanism of market prices can accomplish this on their own.
 A blending of their values and methods – freed from the blinkers of dogma and the determinism of limited imagination – can lead us to the answer.

If anything he looked slightly uncomfortable himself.
 "I'm sure it's nothing important..." He trailed off as my traitorous hand found his arm of its own accord and started pulling again.
 I wasn't sure why I was so anxious; usually I avoided crowds like the plague.
 Maybe I was just trying to prolong our time together.
 I let go as soon as we reached the fringe of the crowd, and prayed it was only my imagination that made me think Brandon was just the slightest bit relieved.
 Luckily there was plenty to distract me.
 It looked like there'd been some kind of war behind the school.
 The flagpole had a massive dent in its base, and actually looked like it was leaning slightly to one side.
 The straggly grass, kept just barely alive by the nearly non-existent rain and infrequent watering by some anonymous grounds keeper, had been torn up.
 Large patches of reddish dirt had been exposed and the ground was scarred by gouges that looked like they'd been made by some kind of farm machinery except for being so irregular.

She wanted to go to Hollywood more than she'd ever wanted anything.
 Well, not more than she wanted to go home.
 She was having fun here, but it was as if she were on holiday.
 She missed her mother and father and friends, and she didn't think she could bear it if she thought she'd never get back.
 What if she skipped her walk in the garden today and today turned out to be her chance to get back?
 But she knew that no one in 1927 was going to take her to Hollywood.
 She smiled, remembering with pleasure the moment when Rick had said he was taking her to Hollywood.
 Her heart sped up again at just the memory.
 Hollywood!
 Rick was giving her her dream.

He weighed over 200 pounds and he could do some damage any way he beat us.
 The primary goal when getting beaten by a person nearly twice one’s size is to limit injuries and not escalate the violence because there is no winning.
 I had seen this tactic with my grandfather and my uncle, and my brother and I were now in a similar situation.
 When someone saw the marks or bruises on our bodies we lied so we didn’t get a repeat performance.
 Gym teachers or other kids during showers after PE class asked the most questions.
 We just blamed it on each other as a fight between brothers.
 We just learned to live with it and survive.
 We became quite the fighters at school and other kids learned not to screw with us or we would beat them down.
 It was just something one gets good at when one is in constant training.
 My parents—I had been instructed to refer to Dino as my father—entertained a lot.

As he walked the hallway into the main hearing chamber, knights stood along the walls.
 As Rodregas passed they all mumbled the same words to him, “Welcome to the Order my brother.” Several reached out and shook his hand or showed other signs of welcome.
 Others, though, looked at him strangely, clearly put off by the way he had won the melee.
 He felt a little unsteady, not sure what to make of both the welcome and the uncomfortable looks.
 As he passed through the doors in the main hearing chamber, the Grand Marshal stood at the far end waiting.
 In the chamber were both knights and squires.
 Many smiled; he thought a few looked like the ones in the hall, not sure what to think of this new knight.
 Rodregas was not surprised that when he started to kneel in front of the Grand Marshal, for Van’dret to step forward and speak.
 “Grand Marshal, you are not really thinking of knighting this fiend, are you?
 He killed a fellow squire out there.

 He’s your dad!
 Jim – We all have urges you know.
 Just cause he’s a bit older doesn’t change anything.
 I think the pile of porn defiantly proves that.

 Yeah right!

How could he have done what he did?
 How could he put doubt in her mind about her fiancé and then-then .
 .
 .
 try to seduce her?
 He loved her and desperately wanted to make love to her, and her response to him was passionate and unrestrained.
 But she was confused--he knew that.
 And he knew that she was a virgin.
 He'd felt her initial hesitation when he'd tried to coax her lips apart, felt the shock go through her body when his tongue had touched hers.
 The fact that she'd found the kiss exciting didn't change the fact that she was an innocent.

Economic entitlement, rather than a shortage of food or food production capacity, is the key to global food security.
 Lack of employment opportunities is also directly linked to destruction of the environment, both rural and urban.
 The destruction of tropical rain forests has been one result.
 The greatest security challenges of the twenty-first century are economic, not military or political.
 Employment is a sine qua non for meeting these challenges.
 A thorough examination of facts and a dispassionate analysis reveal grounds for hope and opportunities for action.
 The possibility of more rapid economic growth and rising incomes in both developed and developing countries – spurred by further substantial reduction in defence spending, the diffusion and application of new technologies, economic liberalization leading to growth of international trade, the globalization of financial markets, and the emergence of new engines for global expansion among developing countries – indicates that our apprehensions need not prove justified, provided society acts courageously and decisively to meet the challenge.
 A global overview of employment cannot do full justice to the special circumstances, problems and potentials of specific regions and countries, but it can dispel the growing concern that employment has become a problem beyond the means of governments or the global economy to eradicate or even contain.
 In the final analysis, creation of jobs for all is not a question of possibility.
 It is a question of necessity.

Restructuring the UN
 The formation of the International Commission on Peace & Food was conceived in 1987, a time when mutual suspicions, escalating military expenditure and confrontational Cold War rhetoric blinded the world to the possibility of radically transforming the global security environment.
 Yet, fuelled by the bold initiatives of Mikhail Gorbachev, by the time ICPF conducted its first meeting on the border of the rapidly vanishing Iron Curtain at Trieste in September 1989, the Berlin Wall had fallen, Cold War hostilities had melted, and the prospect of ushering in a more peaceful and prosperous world for all seemed within reach.
 The euphoria of those heady days generated high expectations of a peace dividend that would help to wipe away much of the world’s suffering.
 At the same time, the withdrawal of the confrontation between East and West resulted in a gradual shift of attention from the threat of imminent global self-destruction to lesser but very real problems, among them – the unresolved danger arising from huge stockpiles of nuclear weapons; some 26 on-going localized military conflicts within and between developing nations, aggravated by increased trafficking in small armaments; the persistence of hunger and malnutrition, especially among the poorest populations of South Asia and politically unstable regions of Africa; progressively rising levels of unemployment in both industrialized and developing countries; and the turbulence and hardship of political, economic and social transition in post-Communist Eastern Europe.
 These challenges, coupled with the outbreak of the first Gulf War, the disintegration of Yugoslavia, and the horrendous civil wars that wracked Somalia and Rwanda, clouded the world’s vision of a brighter future.
 It was in this context that the Commission undertook five years of research that led to the publication of its report in the fall of 1994.
 The report was released at official functions at UN headquarters in New York, UNESCO in Paris, a global congress of the World Academy of Art and Science at Minneapolis, and in the restored capital of a reunited Germany at Berlin, then formally presented to the UN Secretary General and to all UN member nations by a member of the Commission, Her Majesty Queen Noor on behalf of the Government of Jordan.
 In the decade since then, much has happened to belie the expectations of post-Cold War optimists and pessimists alike.
 On the positive side, the sudden emergence and explosive growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web have fuelled a global revolution in communication, education, economy and a wide range of human activities reaching from corporate board rooms in North America to rural towns and villages on every continent, abridging the time, distance and differences separating countries, classes and people.

In some instances, it may be feasible to establish international ‘Earth corps units’, specially trained and equipped to carry out certain types of environmental protection and restoration, such as India’s eco-battalions, which seek to conserve the Himalayan habitat by restoring tree cover and constructing small dams and canals.
 International development force
 The goals of peace, prosperity and fulfilment for every human being represent formidable challenges – intellectual, attitudinal, organizational and technological.
 We cannot hope to reach such lofty achievements if we waste and squander the precious and abundant resources – mental, psychological, social and material – placed at our disposal.
 A massive reduction in emphasis on weapons production and military establishments, made possible by recent political events and demanded by the pressing unmet needs of people everywhere, represents both a great opportunity and a considerable challenge.
 The opportunity is not only further to reduce the threat of war by reducing the capacity for waging war, but also to redirect and utilize for other purposes the resources now dedicated to war making and prevention.
 The challenge is to do so at a time when rising unemployment and economic stagnation in many countries make further cuts in the size of the military unpopular domestically.
 Since 1990, the total number of military personnel worldwide has declined by two million or about six per cent.
 By 1998, a further decrease of at least two million is anticipated.
 A large proportion of these demobilized people have already joined, or will soon join, the forces of the unemployed.

So I was slightly less mean by the time Mother Teresa walked to the altar.
 In strong yet gentle English, she said, “Let us ask Our Lady to give us her heart, so that we will offer service to the poorest of the poor.” Neither weathered skin nor stooped shoulders could alter the beauty she exhibited, as she recited from the Gospel of Matthew.
 “Whatever you did for the least of these brothers of mine you did for me.” Her eloquence depends upon simplicity and a talent for repeating for emphasis without condescension.
 Her message always expresses or implies that by serving the poorest of the poor, the MCs minister to Christ in his distressing disguise.
 This morning she quoted, “For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me."
 She only spoke a few minutes, yet three times she asked that we pray for the MCs and the poorest of the poor.
 I joined the receiving line.
 As those of us standing went first, it only took a few minutes, during which I received the clarity to recognize that God, the source of all power, only works through people who stand aside and let him.
 Mother Teresa has built a mighty force of little, brown, meek, powerful women, because she knows and practices the art of humility, as perfectly as anyone I've witnessed.
 Her ego vanishes.

It made me dizzy, I’ll tell you.
 I mean I was in high school.
 I think that’s when I started leaving Memphis.
 In a way.
 That’s when I got kind of a big head and dreamt of things beyond.
 I certainly had left Central High School, left my friends, my girlfriends.
 Even before we cut the album.
 Tennessee planted that seed, man.
 I mean, I loved the guy, but I saw where he was, where he’d always been, how he’d been treated like a second class citizen his whole life—I mean, we couldn’t even go into some restaurants together, still, at that late date.
 And, metaphorically, I started packing my bags.

Despite the incredibly grave nature of everything that'd happened in the last few hours, I felt mildly euphoric.
 Maybe this was what people were talking about when they said they were buzzed.
 "Maybe they weren't going to kill you.
 I can't say for sure, but they've both killed people before.
 I couldn't take the chance that they weren't just playing around.
 I had to stop them."
 I thought for a moment that my knees were going to collapse on me.
 I carefully reached up and brushed the bandage on his shoulder.
 "They could've killed you?"
 Alec shrugged.

“Gentleman, please,” said Jordaan.
 “You must have understood that this village took a great risk in taking you, and those you rescued, in.
 The only way Imeralda was able to get their support was to offer the bounty of the Immortal Guard’s equipment.” As if called from Jordaan’s words, Imeralda landed in the clearing, seemingly leaping from one of the nearby trees.
 She looked a bit out of breath, like she had sprinted at a run to the Dwello.
 She took a quick look at Doi’van and Rodregas and paled.
 Doi’van’s eyes were literally glowing red and he was tossing his horned head with his wild black hair flying.
 Imeralda had not seen him in such a mood before, not even during the battle with the slave caravan.
 Imeralda thought that Rodregas was only marginally better.
 The muscles of his neck and shoulders were bunched up and she could feel his anger through her bond with him.
 But he was also breathing deeply and through the bond she knew he was trying to control himself.

If I can depend on nothing else, I can rely on that."
 A little eddy of wind found its way into our grotto, and for the first time my newly-acute sense of smell registered Alec's presence.
 His scent was divine, full of subtle themes I wasn't experienced enough to pick out, all of which screamed of warm power and rock-like masculinity.
 For half a second the torrent of sensation was too strong to leave room for conscious thought.
 I realized I'd closed my eyes to better savor the experience.
 When I opened them Alec's expression had moved from annoyance to sadness.
 I had a pair of heartbeats to wonder at the strange tricks my subconscious was playing on me, and then the dream started fading away.
 The heavenly surroundings were predictably the first thing to disappear, leaving afterimages of light burned into the corners of my vision.
 Alec was the next thing to go, but the memory of his features clung to my mind long after I found myself in a featureless void.
 Stranger still, his scent stayed with me even longer.

When all and everyone else had failed him over the years, only his duty had kept Rodregas alive.
 He no longer knew what to do without it.
 His back straightened and he pulled away from the wall that he had slumped against.
 Rodregas lived instead of the man whose body he now lived in.
 He had seen the tragedy of gifted person after gifted person be torn asunder by the Immortalists.
 He hated the Immortalists for their casual destruction and use of people.
 Could he now live in one of these stolen bodies, unless he had a reason?
 The Immortalists and their Guild were evil and needed to be opposed.
 The gods had given him a new duty.
 He stepped away from the wall.

I thought they would be made of stone like the frog,” said Imeralda.
 Rodregas nodded.
 The beasts looked to be made of flesh and bone, except they all stood perfectly still on short stone pedestals.
 Strangely, the room did not smell of damp stone like the rest of the cathedral, but the air smelled of the outdoors in spring.
 Rodregas’ eyes were drawn to the powerful lion that reared up not far into the gathered animals, and just to the right of the center.
 He walked over to it.
 It looked like it could have been the twin for the beast that had been devoured by the blue flame on top of Raven Keep.
 He stepped up close looking up at the beast; he was massive!
 The beast’s mouth was open, not as if he was going to roar, but simply in relaxed pose.
 He looked like he had been caught stalking forward on the hunt.

And she didn't think she'd stop him even knowing that they would end up making love.
 Half an hour later Marie sat up.
 "I guess I'd better go get dressed."
 "OK." "I'm not going to take a shower.
 I've lain with you all night, and I want to have your scent on me as long as possible."
 He smiled a bit.
 "I'll go take this shirt off and put it in a bag."
 She went to her room and put on a set of black lace underwear and a set of emerald on top of that.
 Now that she knew Rick was the key to opening the door, she wasn’t worried that clothing from 2011 would keep her from getting back.
 She wanted to wear the black dress they'd bought for their trip to Hollywood, but she put on her Egyptian-motif dress, not wanting to shock her parents.

It was past time for the bus to arrive, and she still wasn't here.
 A car zipped around the corner driving way too fast, just like Britney always did, but it wasn't white.
 I looked past it, hoping to see another one following it.
 My mouth nearly hit the ground when I recognized the throaty roar and dark paint job of Brandon's Mustang.
 "I knew you'd be sitting here worrying she wouldn't come."
 It took a minute for the words to make sense.
 "Fine, but that doesn't shed any light on why you're all the way out here."
 The gray eyes just visible in the slowly growing light crinkled up in a smile.
 "I called her and told her I'd pick you up.
 She can take you home, I'll come pick you up every morning."

Thomas called again when he had Brandon in his car, saying while Brandon looked horrible, he was alive and on his way to a detox center, which would be followed by rehab—hopefully.
 My brother had connections at this rehab center.
 It’s a big one, called Narconon, a non-profit operated by the Church of Scientology, to which my brother belongs.
 We are not Scientologists, but honestly I didn’t care who was running the program.
 I had heard my fair share of opinions and criticism of this religion but it just didn’t outweigh the other options.
 “Honestly,” I told Lisa, “I don’t care if he comes out with a shaved head and a pony tail selling incense at the airport, as long as he comes out clean and sober with the ability to deal with his addiction.” She agreed.
 As we put one foot in front of the other, his journey would begin, hour-by-hour followed by a day then a week and hopefully he would embrace the program and discover whatever was causing his self-destructive behavior.
 Early on, I had many phone calls and up-dates from the staff of the rehab center as to Brandon’s progress, some good and most bad.
 He craved this drug and he would say anything to get it.
 He would claim he was in extreme pain and he needed a doctor or anything as an excuse to escape to the outside world.

Instead Jason came forward and attacked with his knives.
 The beast froze the first few into harmless ice cubes but finally went down when one got past its defenses.
 Behind his body appeared seven Thrashers and many more Frost beasts.
 It was like a monster reunion.
 I’ve never seen so many in one place before.
 A Thrasher pack had at least six or seven but there must have been more than ten monsters total.
 It was scary.
 Right then, right at that very moment, I knew something was terribly wrong.
 They all stopped in front of us, all those pairs of angry eyes staring at us.
 They made me confused, from the warm feeling the Frost Beasts gave me to the cold feeling the Thrashers inflicted.

Marie sighed with pleasure as she returned Rick’s kiss.
 She’d never dreamed anything could make her feel this way.
 “Are you hungry?” he asked, kissing the tip of her nose.
 “Starved.”  She hugged him.
 They went downstairs with their arms around each other.
 “Did you make pancakes?” she asked.
 “Yeah.
 I’m starved, and I figured you would be too.
 So we’re having pancakes and bacon and eggs and juice.” “Mmm—that sounds great.
 And it smells even better.”  She sat down, poured syrup on her pancakes, and dug in.

If I really pushed, I could faintly feel the hard edges, but there were so many layers shrouding them.
 I just couldn't seem to muster up enough concentration to care.
 I was on autopilot now.
 I answered Britney's whispered questions without ever registering them and never once worried about whether or not I'd made sense.
 I parried Mrs. Campbell's concerned inquiries in much the same manner, probably not convincing her that I was okay, but at least persuading her to leave me alone, and then sleep-walked into the cafeteria.
 I hated the fact that I wanted Brandon to come sit down with me.
 If he did a convincing enough job pretending to like me and I tried really hard, maybe I'd believe it'd all just been my imagination.
 It'd be one less piece of my world crumbling out from under me.
 Britney slammed her tray down, but my listless gaze didn't move from the vacant corner where Brandon usually sat.
 A few minutes later a group of girls came to join us.

“Maybe it’s something you should think about.”  He ran his thumb over her lower lip.
 “You deserve better, Marie.”  He tilted her chin up, touching his lips to hers.
 When she didn't pull away, he repeated the feather-light touch.
 He felt her breath, the quivering of her lips.
 He kissed the corner of her mouth and nuzzled her cheek.
 Gathering her closer, he began taking her lips in one soft kiss after another.
 But as her response grew warmer, his kisses became hungrier.
 Marie was growing hot and felt almost drugged by Rick's kisses.
 She ran one hand over his chest, wishing that his shirt had buttons so that she could undo one and slip her hand inside.
 If--oh!

 Jim – You do that, I’ll start looking for the number that pizza parlor uptown.

 Jim – (To himself out loud) Well, at least I caught it on the first bounce, I could have gotten into much trouble had I missed a chance to drop a complement.
 (Jim walks over to the couch and sits down, taking out a new addition of S-A and starts to read it, momentarily both Eugene and Johnny enter)
 Eugene – Ok, this time I’m going to crush you!

 Johnny – Right.
 Eugene – You’re going to be humiliated.

My attempt at concentration must have come across as anxiety.
 “You found a way to break their bonds before.
 You will again.” I nodded.
 My nose was itchy.
 I wiggled it.
 “Rest now,” he said.
 “We have time.” I reached forward, ready to ask him to stay, but he wasn’t leaving.
 He only settled in.
 Both he and Ruby were staying with me.
 I was happy… downright blissful.

The pool featured a high dive like the one at Carmen Ranch Club where Eric worked part-time as an apprentice lifeguard and trampoline instructor.
 He climbed, sprang, jackknifed and got a few cheers from spectators, including several showgirls.
 Though I had never attempted a high dive before, after some bourbon, the feat looked simple.
 Inches from the end of the board was a depression full of water, on which my foot slipped.
 I tried to stop, but too late.
 The world spun sideways then upside down before I pinched my eyes closed.
 When my head nicked the board, the day went black.
 I don’t remember falling.
 Probably the water revived me.
 As Eric helped me out, I got more cheers than he had.

The time came sooner than any of us expected.
 Looking back, I suppose it was fortunate.
 I can’t imagine what might have happened if a full birth ceremony had been prepared, if so many had been present.
 It makes me cringe to merely think of it.
 The elders were there, though.
 My father and the others waited in the throne room, arranging a celebration.
 I had read everything I could obtain on the process during my pregnancy and imprisonment in the castle, even finding a few books and scrolls on humans.
 But nothing prepared me for what happened.
 I had been walking when the pain struck—pacing my room with worry, if I were truthful.
 It hit suddenly, a stabbing, ripping, horrible thing.

“I don’t know!” he cried.
 Strength surged into him, dark and unholy.
 In the blink of an eye, he twirled both swords, knocked Aurelia’s staff from her hand, and then looped his right arm all the way around to bury Condemnation deep into her stomach.
 Everything, all fighting, all arguing, all bleeding, living and dying halted at that moment.
 For Harruq, there was only the sight of Aurelia doubled over, her eyes filled with sadness.
 His arm yanked the blade out of her, without any thought on his part.
 “Harruq?” she gasped.
 She fell on her back, still clutching her bleeding abdomen.
 That look of sadness tore through his rage.
 What should have been the exhilaration of the kill was instead the cold, biting emotion of guilt.

“Shouldn’t you be preparing for the trip?” “Shouldn’t you?” I countered.
 “I am babysitting.” I stuck my tongue out at him.
 Tired, I settled back into my seat.
 “Steed, tell me about breeding horses.” He sighed.
 “How much detail do you want?” I giggled.
 He smiled as he started into the subject, explaining what he’d been taught about breeding techniques and dominant traits when he was young.
 His father had imparted to him all he had learned in his lifetime and all their ancestors had passed down before.
 They bred the animals methodically, striving to combine certain traits, bring them together in a single horse.
 With each generation, they strengthened the line, even bringing in new breeds from other lands to add to the list of desired attributes.
 Smoother gait, better endurance, stronger health, longer life.

I was staying bound.
 I let out a frustrated growl, clenching my jaw shut.
 He was one of them.
 I had to remember that.
 I might have run back to the village right then, but they would never release me.
 I had nothing.
 I glanced down the mountainside.
 I couldn’t have found my way back if I’d wanted to.
 I had no idea where I was.
 I stared at my palms, some spell-bought map carved into my skin, and was hit full force with the knowledge that I didn’t even know where I was going.

It is also faced with the challenge of making a real further contribution on issues which engage so many excellent minds and institutions world wide.
 In formulating the ideas and recommendations incorporated in this report, it has been our objective to avoid utopian and idealistic prescriptions that are incapable of being translated into practice in the foreseeable future.
 At the same time, we have refused to be confined by what is presently considered realistic and practicable, because both intuition and recent experience confirm that our conception of what is real and achievable are themselves often the expression of limited and short-sighted perceptions.
 Disclaimer
 Due to the diversity and complexity of the views examined by the Commission, and the heterogeneous mix of Commission members drawn from a wide range of countries, backgrounds and professions, it has not been possible to arrive at consensus on all the views discussed in this report.
 Five years of research and discussion have created a much greater commonality of perspective, but there are still significant differences among members regarding specific views and recommendations presented in this report.
 However, all the Commissioners agree with the basic emphasis on social and gender equity, job-led growth and human security.
 Members share the conviction that a candid and challenging discussion of these issues is more valuable than representation of a consensus view.
 The Next Millennium

The half-orc grinned.
 “All the time.
 I’m known for it, in fact.
 Harruq Tun, trainer of elves, slayer of dragons, and man of the ladies.”
 “Please.” She rolled her eyes.
 “Not this lady.”
 “Never said you were one, elfie.”
 Aurelia gave Harruq a brutal glare.
 “And why not?”
 He picked at some grass and said nothing.

The dark roots of my hair were stark in the mirror’s reflection, and I recalled the dream.
 The memories of my mother were fuzzy, but I’d always thought she’d had light hair, beautiful and golden like Junnie’s.
 In the dreams, it was black… as black as the roots of my hair were now.
 I stood there for a long moment, staring at the darkness, and then spun as I made another stupid, rash decision.
 Slinking past Fannie’s room, I headed for her makeshift vault.
 She kept all the things I wasn’t allowed to touch in that room; it was supposed to be off limits.
 Not that I’d bothered trying much, because there was a large flat stone—covering where it hid in the floor—that I’d never been able to move.
 But that was before.
 I wasn’t sure how the magic had worked with the bird, but I knew it had, so I dropped to my knees, held my hands above the stone, and closed my eyes, concentrating with everything I had.
 Nothing happened right away, and my mind wandered a bit with thoughts of what might be inside, how I wanted to see and needed to touch my family heirlooms.

Still, Rodregas knew with sudden clarity that he needed to establish himself as the one in charge.
 If he did not establish his leadership, the next time the Dire Cats were hungry they would try eating one of his party, or at least one of the horses.
 Rodregas walked over to the bear corpse and as he approached, both cats seemed to fully wake up and took on a crouch stance.
 He pretended to ignore them and pulled one of his short swords out, in a casual way.
 Rodregas kept his focus on the bear; he knew that lionesses in prides do most of the hunting and the alpha males simply ate after the kill was done.
 He started to cut away a large chunk of the bear’s haunch to take back to the barn for their dinner.
 One of the lionesses growled and bit down on the haunch not far from him.
 His heart stopped for a moment.
 Rodregas thought she was going to take his hand for a second.
 With his free hand he made a fist and slammed the side of her head.

I shouldn’t be talking; I was wearing pajamas covered in little pigs.
 Emily leaned back to turn off her desk light.
 It clicked off and I gazed outside one more time before turning around to go to bed.
 “Night Emily.” I yawned.
 Emily didn’t reply because her face was pushed up against the window.
 Her body was ridged and she didn’t move.
 I crawled over to the window.
 “What is it, Em?” I whispered, a nervous feeling creeping into my stomach.
 She backed away from the window so I could see.
 I saw nothing at first but then I spotted movement.

He sheathed the blade.
 Aurelia felt her world slow and the nightmare relent.
 _He did no harm,_ she thought.
 No killing.
 He may not be the Forest Butcher, and even if he meant to do what she feared, it didn’t mean the others were him.
 The hope felt juvenile and ignorant but she clung to it tightly.
 The magic left her fingertips, and doing her best to calm her heart, she followed Harruq back home.
 “Nothing?” Qurrah asked when Harruq stepped inside.
 “Nothing.”
 It seemed Qurrah would leave it at that, but he clearly saw the apprehension on his brother’s face.

Half an hour later, I was following him down the hall towards Physics and wishing I'd had more time to prepare.
 Alec slowed as we finally arrived outside the door to Mrs. Alexander's classroom.
 I carefully craned my head around him, half expecting to see Brandon's entire pack waiting to ambush us.
 Instead the pause seemed to have been caused by the fact Mrs. Alexander had been replaced by a sub.
 "Do you mind if we don't go to Physics today?"
 Alec's question should have been lost in the clamor of all of the kids walking by us, but I picked his voice out as easily as if we'd been alone together in the forest.
 Was that another mystical power granted to alpha shape shifters, or just because I was so hyper-aware of him?
 "I thought you said we'd get in trouble if we started cutting school."
 His easy, graceful shrug pulled his black polo shirt tight across his shoulders.
 It seemed impossible that anyone could be so well built and tightly ripped that you'd be able to see every muscle through his clothing, but there he was.

 “What did you learn this time?” Dieredon asked as Aurelia arrived at their designated spot in the forest.
 “Something is wrong,” she told him.
 “He’s kind-hearted, even goofy.

 Everything else he does is for fun or survival.” Aurelia sighed and rubbed her hands across her face.
 “It could all be an act,” Dieredon ventured.

"Don't be angry with me, Alec.
 You're all I have left."
 "I'm not angry, Mother, but you're wrong.
 You have much more left than just me."
 She shook her head with a youthful smile.
 "Such a good boy."

 I started to follow her, but Alec recaptured my hand in his.
 "She just needs a little time.

“Only the Immortalist have ever taken on the essence of a Celestial Beast as they get ready to become gods,” Imeralda continued.
 Her eyes wandering around the arena, waiting.
 Her voice had a casual quality, but Rodregas sensed she thought this very important.
 “When Doi’van sees you, he thinks of you as one of the blood, a noble in fact, if not by birth.
 Most of the men and women in this circle are that; faster, stronger because they descend from a Celestial god.
 But you are not that.
 The Celestial Beasts all represent something.” She paused, looking at him for the first time.
 “What does The Lion represent, Rodregas?” she asked.
 Rodregas was silent for a moment and then said, “Strength, the Hunter, and Protector of the Pride.” He spoke words that he knew he had learned as a child at temple.
 Imeralda nodded, a smile starting to appear on her face.

State control of farm support systems, including marketing, transportation and input supply, is highly bureaucratic, inefficient, and, often, corrupt.
 Overvalued exchange rates encourage the import of low-priced farm products, depress local farm incomes, and make exports uncompetitive.
 Underdeveloped infrastructure results in high transport and marketing costs.
 The slow rate of technological development and diffusion have slowed growth in agricultural productivity.
 Irrigation potential is underdeveloped and poorly managed.
 A major international commitment is needed to reverse the trends and end the famine threat in Africa.
 The region possesses considerable potential that could be converted into higher rates of growth.
 Africa has the world's largest reserve of arable land, one billion hectares, of which only 20 per cent is presently cultivated.
 Fertilizer use in sub-Saharan Africa is very low relative to other developing countries.
 Per hectare consumption averages just 13 per cent of the level in India and 3.5 per cent of the level in China.

In her mind she could see his face as he told her she was beautiful.
 Her heart had sped up then but nothing like when he'd tilted her chin up and looked into her eyes.
 She'd known then that he was going to kiss her, but she'd been unable to turn away.
 And then his lips had touched hers.
 She shivered beneath the hot spray as she remembered the pleasure she'd felt.
 But that pleasure had frightened her, because it was wrong.
 She was betrothed to Davis.
 When she was dressed, she put her betrothal ring back on.
 She shouldn't have left it off last night.
 And she should have asked Rick to set an alarm for her so that she could have walked in the garden this morning.

I mean I love to travel with you, but while Doi’van and I are warriors, when you joined us it was only as a travel companion.
 If you want to stay with the village or stay with Jordaan I will understand.
 You know that by now they will be hunting us, if not because of Ravenhurr’s death, than because of the missing Immortal Guards.” “You know that I probably killed more slavers with the Black Yew bow than either you or Doi’van right?” asked Imeralda with a snort.
 “Your abilities are not of question,” Rodregas responded.
 “Your abilities as a Forest Nymph and as an archer make you a very deadly woman.
 As you gain control over your magical powers you will only become more dangerous.
 The question is whether you want to fight?” Imeralda nodded and she hesitated.
 “I will be honest,” she said.
 “I am a little torn, I have never been as afraid as during and after the battle.
 I have truly come to care for both of you.

The dresses were shapeless, and the men’s pants were baggy.
 And he certainly wasn’t going to wear a raccoon coat.

Whenever Henry encounters a crisis or challenge, he goes to Bingo and bares his soul but never gets an answer.
 Maybe on account of being an only child, ever since I can remember, I have longed for a best friend to whom I could tell all the crazy stuff I think and feel.
 A best friend is what I hoped Karen Flagstad could be.
 I used to think, with someone who could know my secrets and also douse the fire in me and thereby keep me from all the nonsense men do on account of women, I could live content and free.
 I won’t argue the chicken and egg question, does our desire for intimacy rise out of our need for God, or is our belief in God the desperate attempt to satisfy that inborn desire for intimacy.
 But I’m placing my bets on the former, the need for God answer.
 Which is why, on this road trip, I find myself hopeful to the point of desperation that, taking a cue from Brother Lawrence, I can learn to adore God enough so that he will become my daily companion, whom I count on and trust with my failings and secrets.
 Suddenly, maybe invited by all the remembering, a whole other wave of thought takes hold of me.
 I find myself muttering a line a line from Kerouac, maybe from Dharma Bums.
 “If we knew time, we would know everything.” While contemplating that idea, I begin to suspect that in some real though unfathomable way I’m not only here and now, driving alongside the silvery ocean, in Pismo Beach, June 2010.

Such constraints limited part-time jobs to around 10 per cent of the total in Belgium, France, Italy and Spain compared to around 25 per cent in Britain and Denmark.
 4.Modify tax policies:The present income and payroll tax system raises the real cost of labour relative to other resources, such as capital and energy, and thereby discourages job creation.
 It heavily taxes people for working, which indirectly raises the cost of labour and reduces the number of jobs.
 At the same time the system provides investment and depreciation incentives that encourage indus try to shift from labour-intensive to capital-intensive modes of production.
 Much of the shift from labour to capital might not be economically justified were it not for the in-built bias in this system.
 Low levels of taxation on the depletion of non-renewable energy resources in the United States is another distorting influence that makes machine-driven activity more cost-effective than it would otherwise be.
 5.Analyse job impact of government policies: Almost every government policy has a direct or indirect impact on employment.
 Often the relationship is not recognized or intended.
 An analysis of the impact of major public policies on employment at the local, state and nation level can result in avoidance or removal of significant legislative and administrative roadblocks to job growth.
 Require employment assessment of new policy initiatives prior to adoption.

Is it that obvious?” The augothas seemed to cock its head.
 “Well you can't be a faery because you don't have the ears and you can't be a pixie because they're always giggling around.
 How can you understand me?” Emily shrugged.
 “I don't know, it's this new power I have.
 My friend has one too.” “That sounds like the other one.” “What do you mean?” she asked.
 The augothas uncurled its tail and took off in the air.
 “I must go, friend.
 Good luck.” It took off into the sky and Emily couldn't see it anymore.
 She sighed and leaned back.
 This was getting too complicated.

The answer fell out of my mouth of its own accord.
 It took me several seconds to realize it was the truth.
 I didn't have a ride home until Britney finished up her regular studying stint.
 "For Britney?
 Do you want us to give you a ride home?"
 A slight movement, barely seen out of the corner of my eye, gave meaning to the last part of the sentence.
 A familiar-looking guy was standing a few feet from Rachel.
 I couldn't place him.
 I slowly shook my head, trying to jar something loose enough to figure out who he was.
 "Please, Adriana.

Then I watch a family, a couple and two daughters, strolling beside the river.
 As I study them, one at a time my vision cuts deeper, and I see the creator alive in each of them.
 And as I picture Jesus, I recognize some of His expressions.
 Patience.
 Forgiveness.
 Loyalty.
 Love.
 I spend a while adoring God.
 Nowhere near as much as He deserves.
 But more now than before.

I looked past it, hoping to see another one following it.
 My mouth nearly hit the ground when I recognized the throaty roar and dark paint job of Brandon's Mustang.
 "I knew you'd be sitting here worrying she wouldn't come."
 It took a minute for the words to make sense.
 "Fine, but that doesn't shed any light on why you're all the way out here."
 The gray eyes just visible in the slowly growing light crinkled up in a smile.
 "I called her and told her I'd pick you up.
 She can take you home, I'll come pick you up every morning."
 My head was spinning.
 Why would the most popular boy in school want to pick me up for school every morning?

You were so beautiful, and I couldn’t imagine anyone treating you the way Davis had.
 The article said you were vibrant and fun-loving before your marriage.
 That captured my imagination, I guess, and I was sitting in the garden drinking tea and thinking about you, imagining what you were like and what your life must have been like before your marriage.
 And then-and then you walked into my garden.” “Incredible.”  She stared up at him.
 “But how?
 I mean, how did that .

 Had you ever done that before?” “No.”  He shrugged.

I felt slightly comforted either way.
 Once we were on our way, I didn’t mind so much.
 I was enjoying being back in the rhythm of the ride, not to mention the break from training.
 Conversation flowed easily as we made our way farther up the mountain.
 I had been thinking about my discussion with Steed, but hadn’t decided how to respond if I were asked again about the incident in the clearing, about controlling the snake.
 No one knew about the hawk and I wasn’t sure how I had done it to begin with, so I couldn’t exactly explain it.
 It would have been like explaining how to wiggle your ears to someone who wasn’t able.
 But it had been easy for me, much easier than fire even.
 I drew my cloak tighter around my shoulders and yawned as I considered my horse.
 I’d had so much trouble learning to control him, trying to push him from the outside.

 One story was about Olga: Lately even George Bush talks of conservation and cutting our reliance on middle east oil.
 So I’m convinced it’s time we ask ourselves if living more like Olga Savitsky wouldn’t be preferable to the way we are living.
 Olga is a minimalist.

For a project in her second grade class, she wrote and illustrated a book, which her teacher bound, entitled The Fast Friendly Pitcher’s Bad Remembering Day.
 I suppose if I live another thirty years, my eyes will still mist when I think of my girl as the fast friendly pitcher.
 University of Arizona, whom I count as my team since I taught there for several years, is leading University of Hawaii when we leave, on account of a book signing.
 My friend Alan, with whom I’ve partnered for a lot of book signings, likes to hound me about a remark I once made, “There’s no such thing as a bad signing.” Well, by now I’ll admit that there is such a thing.
 But most often, even if you don’t sell many books, interesting stuff happens.
 And you never can tell when you’ll get blessed.
 Or challenged.
 Or both.
 A woman of kind and friendly demeanor comes into Chapters, a coffee shop bookstore in Newberg, Oregon, about a half hour from Portland.

Projections indicate that over the next decade growth of the world’s food supply will be adequate to meet the needs of all human beings.
 The UN Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of human beings suffering from hunger and malnutrition between 1990 and 2015 is highly commendable, yet achieving it would still leave an unconscionably large number of people without adequate food.
 More can and must be done in the next decade to eradicate the scourge of hunger.
 The problem of water scarcity is even more pervasive and challenging.
 Studies indicate that by 2015 more than half the world’s population – mostly in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia and Northern China – will be living in countries that are ‘water-stressed’.
 In the developing world, more than 80 per cent of the water is utilized for agriculture, an unsustainable level that is depleting water tables, increasing soil salinity and accelerating erosion.
 Although historically water has often been a source of contention between communities, it has never been the cause of an open inter-state conflict.
 However, nearly one-half of the world’s land surface consists of river basins shared by more than one country and more than 30 nations receive more than one-third of their water from outside their borders.
 Therefore, the danger of confrontation and conflict will escalate unless concerted measures are implemented urgently.
 Water shortages occurring in combination with other sources of tension — such as in the Middle East — will be particularly worrisome.

Oh course; being ourselves, we don’t have any luck at all.
 The sky darkened even more, not that I thought that was possible.
 The mist swirled and a cold chill that ran shivers down my spine ascended on us.
 And out of the mist stepped a dark figure.
 Kojas.
 Again.
 This time for real.
 Not in a dream/vision.
 My heart stopped and my blood froze.
 Kojas’ red eyes gleamed in the darkness and his cloak snapped at the wind.

But you lied.
 You are nothing but dust.”
 Surrounded by fire and death, the half-orc stripped naked of his rags and donned the robes of his former master.
 Despite all the arrows and heat, they seemed in perfect condition.
 Even the stain of blood was already fading.
 Qurrah held the side of the hood to his mouth and coughed as the smoke grew ever thicker.
 “Goodbye, Velixar,” he said.
 Then he chose a direction and staggered away.
 Slowly, and with a few wide curves through the carnage, he found a way out.
 He huddled the black robes tighter about his thin body, relishing the soft feel and perfect fit.

He yelped and went limp.
 I pushed him off and grabbed my fallen bow, the familiar feeling of the wood boosting my confidence.
 I turned back around and started back where I left off, but then a body slammed into me.
 I just had enough time to see the thrasher, before the fur and dirt filled my vision.
 I spit out the clump of wiry hair that had somehow found its way into my gasping mouth.
 I felt a searing pain as the Thrasher raked my left leg.
 I closed my eyes against the pain, trying to focus myself against the dull throb in my shin.
 Then the thrasher went limp against me.
 It was hauled off of my body and I found myself looking up into the face of a very unhappy dark blue haired boy.
 His sword was gripped tightly in his clenched fingers and a look of amusement, or many it was anger, shone on his face.

The half-orc stepped before her, preparing his swords.
 “They won’t touch you.”
 “I know,” Aurelia said, summoning the last bit of magic inside her.
 A tear in the fabric of reality ripped open, swirling with white and blue magic.
 “Get in,” she yelled.
 “What about Qurrah?” he shouted.
 “Go inside, you dumb fool!”
 She cracked her staff across his back.
 Harruq stumbled into the portal and vanished.
 Aurelia stepped in after, arrows landing all around her.

If they were sent in every possible direction, especially in pairs, there was a good chance that he would come across no more than two of them at a time.
 If they were still confused about whether he was or was not Ravenhurr, he would have an excellent chance of overcoming them.
 On the other hand, if the forces of the guild came after him… The guardsmen of the Immortalist guild were known as the Immortal Guards and their reputation as the premier fighters of the realm was seldom questioned.
 If they found out what had happened at Raven Keep there was not much chance for Rodregas’ survival.
 After a simple meal, a good rub down for the horses and a few hours of rest, Rodregas got the wagon back on the road.
 If he could keep up this pace, up he could be well hidden before any forces could find him.
 At the end of the second day, before he had come to his last turn off, he realized that he would have to get some sleep.
 He was feeling exhausted.
 His body might be surprisingly strong and quick but apparently it still needed to sleep on a regular basis.
 As soon as the horses were fed, rubbed down, hobbled and left to graze, Rodregas unrolled Captain Poir’s mattress and collapsed into it with a welcome sigh.

I felt a shudder go through me at what she was saying.
 "So Alec wasn't kidding when he said it wasn't safe for me to be here?"
 "You're probably not in any more danger today than you were that first night.
 Jessica isn't any fonder of you now than she was then.
 I've been working with James every day since then, but he hasn't really come around yet, so he is still a bit of a problem.
 Luckily, with Alec and Isaac both firmly on your side, and Jasmin starting to develop a liking for you, there isn't a thing those two can really do about it.
 As long as Alec is very careful to stay between the two of them and you, you really don't have a reason to worry."
 "He let you get close to me."
 Dom's smile was incredibly winning.
 "Ah, but Donovan was still with you, and not only do I like you more than any of the others, I'm also a cat, so in this case my instincts aren't quite as worrisome."

History does not favor the warmongers, not among the peasants and scribes.
 They favor so-called great men, driven to war by horrid acts of others.”
 The man in black spat his disdain.
 “It is a sad age when conquerors are seen as warmongering butchers and the cowards backed into corners are seen as the true heroes.
 Ashhur can be blamed for poisoning so many with such rubbish.”
 “What will the king do?” asked Harruq, his hands rubbing the hilts of his blades.
 “He has already evicted elven blood from his kingdom.
 Woodhaven, however, still contains hundreds of elves.
 In his pride, Vaelor will demand them to leave.
 A messenger is already en route.

“The Gods and Infernals do not explain their actions, but most believe that if someone had the full potential to tap into all three… he would be stronger than either the Gods or the Greater Daemons.
 He would have the potential to rule all the realms and break the great balance.
 This is something that not even the Infernals want,” he added.
 Rodregas spoke, “So if Ravenhurr, who was a friend of Taiga, was part of a group of Immortalists who are breaking ‘The One Law’ then he might have already added Hellborn power to his own.
 And when I took on Ravenhurr’s power, I also added the Infernal power, which is natural for a Hellborn.
 It could also be a reason that the gods answered my prayers and helped me succeed against Ravenhurr.” “So the Gods might not be against all Immortalists, but just the ones who are tapping into the Infernal power?” asked Doi’van.
 “All Immortalists deserve to die for their crimes,” Rodregas answered.
 His angry response did not surprise the others.
 “Agreed,” said Doi’van, raising his hand in a calming gesture, “but it might be helpful to understand what the gods will support us doing.” “True,” Rodregas added.
 “Doi’van, do you remember the names of the other Immortalists who were interested in purchasing you for their rituals?” “I heard no names,” Doi’van answered, “but I heard one of them referred to as ‘The Ambassador.’ They treated him with great respect.

My watcher.
 This woman.
 Chevelle’s gaze brushed mine once more and I hungered to hear what they were saying.
 I was fixated on it, my mind spinning, convinced that if I were as invisible as everyone thought, if they truly couldn’t see me, at least I could get closer and finally know.
 As I shook my head at the idea, my eyes fell downward.
 A small scream escaped.
 My arms were covered in tree bark, blending seamlessly with the stump on which I sat.
 I bolted upright, batting at them as if my shirt were on fire.
 Chevelle and the cloaked woman ran toward me and I looked up in panic.
 When my eyes fell again to my arms, they were normal.

I'm exactly where I want to be.
 It's not like I'm throwing myself at you this very second.
 Have you come up with an explanation for that yet?"
 Alec stared back up at the clouds rather than meet my eyes.
 "Not yet.
 D...my best guess is maybe that you've realized your best bet at getting what you want long term is to pretend like you're not impacted."
 "Please.
 Do you really believe I have that kind of willpower?"
 "After the things I've seen you go through I'd never doubt your willpower, Adri."
 It was rare that I suffered from a panic attack in Alec's presence but the reference to what I'd lost, combined with my dreaded nickname nearly did the trick.

He wasn’t the same to me anymore; he always had this mask on his face, hiding himself from the rest of us.
 I had to find out what was wrong, and soon.
 “Jazell, are you paying attention?” Emily’s annoyed voice broke my day dreams.
 I snapped back to attention, “Uh yes, I am Emily.
 Just for the record, what are we talking about?” “Jazell you’re hopeless!
 We’re talking about what to do next,” she scowled.
 “Wait,” an idea jumped into my head, “how about we meet under a truce.” Emily stared at me.
 “A truce?
 Seriously?
 That is the complete opposite of what we’re doing.” “I know but trust me; we need to meet under a truce.

I more or less floated through my last two classes.
 It wasn't until I finally got to tutoring that I started to put more stock in the idea that Rachel had simply chosen not to go to Les Misérables.
 She looked up, and then away guiltily as I walked in.
 There wasn't a trace of smile or greeting on her face, an abnormality that hit me hard somewhere in the region of my stomach.
 Albert stopped by to say hi, and I used his presence as a distraction.
 "It sounds like you're almost caught up."
 "Yeah, finally.
 I've got another two weeks or so, but then I'll be all done with this whole triple math homework garbage."
 Albert smiled, and for the first time I noticed how genuine his expressions were.
 It was almost like he was a different person when he wasn't concentrating on explaining some particularly stubborn math problem to one of the slower students.

Just after 7:00 Rick drove onto his own little bit of Boston in the Back Bay.
 He'd had his house built on a beautiful acre that was located on the southeast edge of the area inhabited by Boston's elite.
 Real estate prices there were outrageous, but Rick, with his connections and eye for property, had gotten this parcel for next to nothing.
 It was only a few blocks from the downtown area and considered too close for comfort by true members of the upper class.
 But for Rick it was perfect.
 Both his office and his neighbors were close but not too close, and he had a beautiful lawn in the front and a large patio and flower garden in the back.
 Rick smiled as he walked into his kitchen, loosening his tie.
 Lauri moaned every time she walked into the garden.
 What a waste, she always sighed, looking at him with reproach.
 A woman would love having that garden, but what did a man know about flowers?
