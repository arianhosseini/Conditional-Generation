But practicality ranks at the bottom of my aptitude profile, just below biology and basketball.
 We were vagabonds, back then.
 When Darcy was two months old we moved to Iowa for my gradual school (for a definition of "gradual" see or read The World According to Garp, by John Irving who was my first professor there).
 When Cody was two months old, we moved to Arizona for a teaching job I was offered.
 Two years later, we moved to Chico, California for a job with more security, which we craved on account of the little ones.
 But security only exists as a craving.
 Even though the college in Chico gave me tenure, so they couldn‚Äôt have fired me unless I kidnapped the president or his wife or daughter, I had to leave it behind because Laura and I split apart and my kids, whom I loved more than life, health, art or anything, went to live in San Diego.
 I tried commuting (1000 mile weekend trips) for a while but, feeling what I imagine was a similar emptiness to that of Mexicans who labor up here for their families in Mexico, I chucked the best job I‚Äôll probably ever have and returned to San Diego.
 In those first years back, the times I lived for were coaching Cody and the team during practices and ball games at Kuhlken Field, home of La Mesa National Little League.
 Named after my dad since he had been president and organized the renovation of the field.

 Alec looked like he wanted to say something else, but finally nodded and sat down in the next chair over.
 It wasn't as good as if he'd gone all the way back to his seat, and it was extremely out of character, but it was better than nothing.
 I breathed a sigh of relief that he wasn't going to continue fishing for compliments, and returned to my drawing.
 I knew I should open my books back up and study, but it was starting to take shape, and I figured it was only a few minutes away from becoming recognizable.
 Once that happened my meager drawing skills would evaporate and I'd have to stop anyways.

Therefore, the decision of the UN to insist on the operation of democratic processes in member countries is an essential step toward resolving the dilemma of sovereignty.
 When the representative nature of a national government is in question, its claim to sovereignty over its own people under all circumstances is also questionable.
 Hitherto, it has not been possible to address this issue forth rightly, because the evolution of the international community had not yet come to accept in practice, as opposed to merely in principle, the fundamental human rights so frequently espoused in constitutions and ignored in actions.
 This situation has changed, especially after humanity‚Äôs bitter experiments with totalitarian regimes during this century.
 It is now recognized that the democratic principles of political freedom, social equality, self-determination and related human rights are inalienable and must be extended to all people everywhere.
 The second factor that naturally imposes limits on national sovereignty ‚Äì the rights of other nations and their citizens ‚Äì has also gained substantially wider acceptance, has been enshrined by international law, and has become accepted doctrine governing many facets of international relations.
 Common security against transnational threats and common prosperity for all humankind cannot be based on a 250-year-old concept of nation sovereignty.
 Over the last half century, national sovereignty has been maturing into international sovereignty.
 As the evolution of the international community proceeds towards the establishment of an effective system of world governance in one form or another, the collective rights of the international community of nations must inevitably come to be regarded as another inalienable truth, alongside individual human rights and the rights of each nation.
 The right of the nation state to self-determination has to accommodate the rights of other nations and the common shared rights of every human being.

 "What happened?"
 "She turned cool seven or eight minutes into the conversation, finished her drink, said thank you, and left."
 "She knows what she wants.

I can do this.‚Äù As Rodregas raised the club, he kept his eyes away from the AElf maiden not wanting to give himself away to anyone watching.
 ‚ÄúGods,‚Äù Rodregas quietly prayed.
 ‚ÄúYou have never answered my prayers.
 I have never had much to give you as an offering of wealth to your temples, nor have I done great deeds in your names, but if any of you hate these life-stealing Immortalists as I do, then let me know your favor.‚Äù Rodregas could not help but add a selfish plea to his desperate prayer, ‚ÄúIf by your grace I live, then I promise you gods that I will make it my life‚Äôs duty to fight the Life Stealers.‚Äù Rodregas doubted his prayers would do any good, but if nothing else he was a practical man and when you are pushing the odds it never hurts to call in divine favor.
 Rodregas knew things would start moving quickly now.
 Ravenhurr had been preparing the circles for months, feeding them with unearthly energies.
 Ravenhurr had not wanted the prisoners up on the tower roof until the last moment, lest their fear lead them to take desperate action.
 Ravenhurr started to speak the final words of the spell, setting off months of careful preparations.
 Rodregas knew that sorcerers use ancient languages so that others who might be watching cannot understand what they are saying and guess their intent beforehand.
 During the practice walk-through the week before, Ravenhurr had spoken the same words that he started to utter now.

 Rachel caught up with me before I made it very far.
 "Adriana, are you okay?
 Don't you want a ride home?"
 I turned towards her to respond and just broke down.
 She pulled me into an open classroom and gave me a hug while I tried to explain about the two failed tests, my birthday, and how much I missed my Dad and Cindi.

The separate pieces of information skittered about on the edge of my memory without ever becoming tangible enough to relate to the answer I needed.
 By the time class ended, I'd almost completely shut down.
 I registered the whispers as I made my way to English.
 I normally would've been mad, or possibly embarrassed, but it was like my feelings were wrapped in layers of cotton candy.
 If I really pushed, I could faintly feel the hard edges, but there were so many layers shrouding them.
 I just couldn't seem to muster up enough concentration to care.
 I was on autopilot now.
 I answered Britney's whispered questions without ever registering them and never once worried about whether or not I'd made sense.
 I parried Mrs. Campbell's concerned inquiries in much the same manner, probably not convincing her that I was okay, but at least persuading her to leave me alone, and then sleep-walked into the cafeteria.

He was said to have created the Immortalist Ascension ritual and to have been a genius without par.
 The first guild master Accerntorino was also known for his ego.
 Within two decades of his accession he challenged the All-Father All√≥d for control of the Celestial Pantheon of the Gods.
 Accerntorino claimed he could better lead them to victory over the Daemon Lords of the Infernal Realm.
 But All√≥d quickly and soundly defeated the upstart Accerntorino.
 What still caused whispers almost 400 years later was his fate; the All-Father had destroyed him.
 Everyone knew stories of various gods that had challenged All√≥d over the millennia.
 The punishments he had dealt some were horrible and some simply funny or embarrassing.
 A few times he had even driven Gods to join the fallen Daemon Lords in the Infernal Realm.
 But the All-Father did not kill any of these other challengers.

Freeing pricing without first regulating or dismantling monopolies, promoting privatization of land and enterprises, ensuring free flow of goods, and establishing wholesale markets and multiple distribution out lets lead to speculation, soaring prices, hoarding and falling production.
 Historically, the free market evolved over centuries in conditions of surplus production and stable currency, neither of which exist in Eastern Europe today.
 Efforts to accelerate the development of the market will have first of all to meet the political, legal, social and economic conditions historically required for its creation.
 And these conditions must be met simultaneously.
 4.Macro-economic stability is a precondition for increasing production: It is extremely difficult to increase production in a context of general macro-economic instability and hyperinflation.
 The rapidly falling value of local currencies minimized their utility as a medium of exchange.
 Agricultural as well as industrial enterprises seeking a stable medium in which to hold their wealth increasingly resorted to hoarding marketable, non-perishable commodities such as food grains or converting local currency into foreign money wherever possible.
 This was particularly devastating for agriculture, where higher production was desperately needed to meet consumer demand and reduce dependence on food imports.
 The breakdown of the local currency as an effective medium of exchange was accompanied by an unfavourable shift in the terms of trade between agriculture and industry, resulting from the near-monopolistic position both of the suppliers of farm inputs, especially fertilizers and farm machinery, and the processing units that purchased farm produce, such as dairies and meat processing plants.
 Together, these factors precipitated a rapid fall in farm production and food availability.

mic and political conditions required for increased production do not yet take hold in Eastern Europe. 5.

Meanwhile, advanced computer, satellite and communications technology should be made available to the Secretariat by member states.
 A comprehensive system is needed to monitor military movements.
 Through its resident representatives, the UN should openly monitor political, ethnic, nationalist and religious developments that increasingly lie at the heart of conflicts in order to understand the complexities of local events and to anticipate potential turbulence.
 The right to sovereignty should not include the freedom to privacy in cases which involve support for terrorist groups, instigating border conflicts, arms build-ups, torture and genocide.
 In addition to the role of the UN in consensus fact-finding, it must also acquire the jurisdiction to order fact-finding missions relating to both domestic and regional conflicts in which this type of violation is suspected.
 Cessation of violence and conflict settlement often leave unresolved the root causes of conflict, resulting in potential for renewed fighting or social turbulence.
 Peace-building activities should address underlying economic and social factors that prevent the establishment of a stable and secure peace.
 In instances such as Cambodia, Rwanda and Somalia, the vacuum created by the complete collapse of political and economic institutions necessitates a broader role for the UN in re-establishing the peace.
 Peace building has thus far been defined as post-conflict actions to support reconstruction and to strengthen and solidify peace.
 The concept needs to be broadened to include pre-conflict actions and expanded to encompass a wider array of potentially destabilizing factors that lead to conflicts.

Rodregas thought that they might have been tough opponents if they had not been so beaten up.
 Between the natural durability of his body and the minor Sigil of Healing though, he was feeling fine.
 The knights were clearly trying to find the best five among the competitors.
 They were not necessarily trying to find out who was the best among the five.
 Rodregas watched several fighters that clearly were of the blood or had minor sigils, but he did not fight any that could have offered him a real challenge.
 At the end, after he defeated his final opponents, they tied a bright yellow ribbon to his upper arm and wrote down his name as a top five finisher.
 The top five got bright yellow arm bands, the sixth to tenth finishers white bands, the eleventh through fifteenth red bands, sixteenth through twentieth blue bands and twenty-first to twenty-fifth received a green band.
 Rodregas felt more nervous the next day with the archery competition.
 While luckily the knights provided the bows for all contestants, they did not have them available for practice.

 She didn't want to ask Rick for anything frivolous, and she'd probably get to wear the dress only once or twice.
 But she didn't want him to be embarrassed by a companion who wasn't dressed appropriately.
 Well, she'd ask him where he planned to take her and what she should wear.
 "Why don't we find you a nice, simple dress?"
 Rick asked the next day after they'd bought towels and lotions and visors and sunglasses.

CHET Whispers From the Past
 By Larry Murray
 Meet Charles Tucker, he has spent nearly 30 years living in denial, trying desperately to hide from his past and the events that shattered his heart beyond any possibility of healing.
 He can't let anyone close, for doing so would open him up to being hurt again, and there's no way he could survive another wounding.
 Meet the Saunders family, new to the neighborhood and teetering on the verge of bankruptcy.
 Mark, the father, talks a good story but is that all he is?
 His plan could hold the key to reversing his family's financial misfortunes, or it could wipe out everyone involved.
 Meet Chet, a battered old '64 Chevy pickup that was there on the night Charles' life imploded.
 For nearly three decades, he has been locked away in an old barn, safely out of sight if not completely out of mind.
 For 29 years Charles has blamed the old pickup for the destruction of his life, now he's about to find that the vehicle that destroyed his life might be the key to his healing and a journey of unexpected miracles.

Rodregas looked around the arena to make sure no one was left to fight and then headed into the great hall, carrying the shield of the tournament champion.
 As he walked the hallway into the main hearing chamber, knights stood along the walls.
 As Rodregas passed they all mumbled the same words to him, ‚ÄúWelcome to the Order my brother.‚Äù Several reached out and shook his hand or showed other signs of welcome.
 Others, though, looked at him strangely, clearly put off by the way he had won the melee.
 He felt a little unsteady, not sure what to make of both the welcome and the uncomfortable looks.
 As he passed through the doors in the main hearing chamber, the Grand Marshal stood at the far end waiting.
 In the chamber were both knights and squires.
 Many smiled; he thought a few looked like the ones in the hall, not sure what to think of this new knight.
 Rodregas was not surprised that when he started to kneel in front of the Grand Marshal, for Van‚Äôdret to step forward and speak.
 ‚ÄúGrand Marshal, you are not really thinking of knighting this fiend, are you?

 this is just another way of knighting this fiend.‚Äù He looked at the knight in front, who was standing along the opposite wall. ‚ÄúI think I am not thinking of knighting this 92mfi0mend,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI am not really thinking of knight92ming0m this knight.‚Äù The Grand Marshal looked at Rodregas and said ‚Äú92m,0m I am not really thinking of knight92ming0m this knight, I am thinking of knighting92m this0m fiend,‚Äù he turned and stood

In addition, the increasing incidence of war, terrorism and drug-related violence in the developing world has heightened the sense of insecurity among these countries.
 However, a closer analysis reveals that half of the military expenditure of the developing world is incurred by a small number of oil-exporting countries in the Middle East and North Africa, and another quarter is incurred by other high-income developing nations, mostly in East and South East Asia ‚Äì whereas the 84 developing nations with lower and lower-middle incomes, including such large nations as China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Bangladesh, comprising 72 per cent of the world‚Äôs population, incur roughly 6 per cent of global military expenditure, on average less than 3 per cent of the total GDP of these countries.
 International pressure for defining acceptable levels of military expenditure and reducing defence budgets is entirely warranted, provided that it is applied equitably to all countries, takes into account the varying conditions between regions and nations, and places corresponding limitations on arms exports by industrialized nations.
 Placed under the control of an impartial international agency specialized in security issues, rather than being left to development banks or made an instrument of bilateral policy by donor nations, these measures could effect a further 50 to 75 per cent cut in global defence spending and thereby generate $400 billion to $600 billion per year for non-military purposes, equal to roughly ten times current levels of overseas development assistance.
 The international community should commit itself to a minimum goal of reducing global military expenditure to $400 billion (in 1992 constant dollars) by 2000 AD.
 Military expenditure mitigates but does not resolve the underlying problem of security.
 Today, the most pressing security threats are social, not military.
 The appropriate response to them is greater investment in sustainable human development, not more arms.
 However, preservation of physical security against external aggression is a primal instinct of nation states that cannot be rationalized away.
 Nations will continue to arm themselves as long as that is the only effective means to ensure their security.

 He fell through the air, the long spike on the bottom aimed directly for Velixar‚Äôs head.
 ‚ÄúMaster!‚Äù Qurrah shouted again, shoving his body against Velixar‚Äôs.
 His concentration broken, Velixar lost his control of the black fog.
 The darkness swirled inward as if Velixar were the center of a giant drain.
 The blackness filled him, surrounded him, and consumed him.
 When all returned, and Dieredon was about to land, a wave of pure sound and energy rippled outward.
 Velixar was waking, and he was angry.
 The wave sent Qurrah crashing against a giant undead man still wearing rusted platemail.
 The collision blasted the air from his lungs.

He almost left it at that, but decided to continue, ‚ÄúI killed Ravenhurr during the Ceremony of Ascension.

 The other two I did not meet until afterwards.‚Äù At Rodregas‚Äô response Van‚Äôdret stared at him, ‚ÄúYou killed an Immortalist Sorcerer by yourself in his tower?

 He did chuckle a bit as he said, ‚ÄúFirst, you want me to admit that I killed an Immortalist Sorcerer, and when I do, you don‚Äôt believe me.

 I forget sometimes that other people haven't been privy to the endless hours of speculation that got me from one point to another."
 There was something about her touch that distracted me.
 Not in a bad way, almost like the tickle you get in the back of your mind when you know you're missing out on some key point of plot in a suspense novel.
 "You glow much more brightly than any human I've ever met, but you don't feel like a shape shifter, so you're either a very powerful Fir'shan, one strong enough to mask your nature from Alec, as well as me, or you're a very extraordinary human.
 Alec wouldn't have brought you here until he was sure it was the latter."
 I closed my mouth in astonishment.
 "I didn't realize Alec had talked to anyone about me.
 Actually I think you just let more drop in a few sentences than he's told me all week.
 Alec claims it's because I could be put in danger just by knowing certain things, but I think he's still just not quite sure he can trust me."

I hesitated, slowly making my way down.
 A bridge might mean a village was nearby, and a village meant elves.
 I didn‚Äôt want to get caught, not after all this, so I was fully prepared to run by the time I reached the crossing.
 Its stacked gray stones were bulkier than those that had been appearing more frequently on my path.
 Water flowed beneath, smoothing the stones at the base.
 They were so worn, it must have been in place for centuries.
 The leather soles of my shoes skimmed over ancient stone, the bridge curving gently before flattening out into a worn dirt path on the other side.
 It was more traveled than I would have liked, so I swung wide, through the trees instead.
 The wind shifted and the scent of roasting meat assaulted me, dragging my attention, my feet, its way.
 Despite my concerns about other elves, my stomach tightened, my mouth watering as I followed it through the trees.

By New Orleans, we were low on money, and after one night in that town where we eighteen-year-olds could legally drink, we were broke.
 We slept in our car near a park on the far side of a rundown neighborhood from the French Quarter.
 For food and spending money, we foraged for soda bottles and redeemed them.
 With my share, I bought just enough beer so the proprietor of a smaller Bourbon Street bar allowed me to remain on a stool from which I admired a certain barmaid.
 She reminded me of Karen Flagstad.
 Not in her looks.
 She was taller and red haired.
 But in her expression, I read the same message I got from Karen‚Äôs sweet face.
 It said, I‚Äôve been hurt bad and know how it feels so I‚Äôll be nice to everybody and try not to make anybody else feel that way.

Later I heard Eric coaching Tom that he should refuse to stuff the pain of his hurt feelings inside, because in there, it had no choice but to fester or explode.
 When the hospital released my mom, she could hardly cook, wash dishes, or attempt disciplining me.
 Guilt was her only weapon.
 ‚ÄúSuppose you‚Äôve been drinking,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand a kid on a bicycle pulls out in front of you.
 If you kill him, how is that going to feel?‚Äù Weak as she was, still she refused to sleep until I came home.
 If I stayed away all night, even if I called and assured her I was safe at a friend's house, she would lie awake then nap in the daytime, after I returned.
 Sylvia Curtis was a large blonde with a pinched mouth and squinty, penetrating eyes.
 Even back then, before she reached forty, she wore nothing belted, only shapeless dresses and muumuus.
 She charged around the house with steps so tiny you might wonder if her feet had once gotten bound.
 A unique mother, or at least the opposite of most, she treated her son with great respect and the rest of us with very little.

 "No," she replied, intrigued.
 "What is it?"
 "It's like ice cream but better for you.

 She couldn't make up her mind between chocolate-covered cherry and chocolate almond, so he asked for a sample of each.
 When she at last chose the former, he ordered a waffle cone of it for her--inspired to have M & Ms added at the last minute--and a cone of pecan praline for himself.

He might not take her to a disreputable place like tonight's speakeasy, but Tom thought that Davis was a cold opportunist who saw Marie as part of a package deal--a high position in a successful company, a powerful father-in-law, a rich society wife.
 Tom could barely stand to be in the same room with him.
 An only child, he'd always considered Marie more a sister than a cousin.
 He'd adored her all his life, and that made it virtually impossible for him to refuse her anything--like an evening at a speakeasy.
 But it also made him very protective of her.
 Marie fell asleep that night dreaming of Davis.
 He was tall and handsome, just like the heroes in the books she loved to read.
 His only flaw was that he preferred making money to having fun.
 She giggled sleepily as she thought of how horrified he'd be if he ever found out where she'd been tonight.
 But then, he had to be careful if he wanted her father's approval.

 Albert looked genuinely startled, but recovered quickly.
 "Hey there, idle, profoundly-untrue comments dropped by Mrs. Campbell in passing conversation don't count.
 I'm absolutely not a member of Fatal Angst."
 "Yes, you are, at least you are until I either decide to dispose of your body, or let your little secret out of the bag because you're not doing your job."
 I hadn't heard Mrs. Campbell approach from behind me, and for a second worried she was really angry, but the way Albert chuckled as he cringed in mock fear alleviated my concerns.
 Albert pushed his glasses a little ways back up his nose, and then wandered off to help the next person with a red card face up on their desk.
 The number of people who proceeded to come into the tutoring lab was nothing less than amazing.
 Based on overheard conversations, it sounded like there was a perfect storm of tests.

"Adriana.
 Are you okay?"
 My insides were too raw.
 Just coming out long enough to listen to Mrs. Campbell had opened everything back up.
 My mind tried to shy away, to sink away from the certainty of more jagged shards being shoved into me, but this voice was an important one.
 Rachel looked down at me, her arms wrapped around her waist as if trying to hold herself together.
 "What are you doing?"
 The words stubbornly tried to avoid making sense, but I reached out with my trembling mind and forced them each into their proper place.

 A swelling of nerves in his gut almost forced him to leave.
 Several men in front of him turned away, dejected or angry.

 The idea of so much money, more than enough to buy warm food and clean drink, kept him there.
 At last it was his turn, and he approached the table where Alvrik sat chewing on a piece of bone long since void of meat.

A flutter of auburn hair caught my eye.
 I looked down and noticed goose bumps on the babe‚Äôs shoulders.
 After traveling the world and witnessing racial tensions rising all around, Billy Graham had grown ever more certain that the only solution was at the foot of the cross.
 He said the foot of the cross was the only place where in every sense all of us are equals.
 We‚Äôre all sinners, he said, and we‚Äôre sinners by choice.
 We choose to break God's moral laws.
 We become drunkards or fornicators, selfish, consumed with pride and prejudice and intolerance.
 But the sinful heart can‚Äôt find happiness.
 And God, he assured us, wants his creatures to get happy, which is why Christ said we must be born again, so he could give us new moral natures, new affections, new objectives, and new directions.
 What planted the hook in me was: according to Billy Graham, when you make your decision for Christ, you do it for the sake of the nation and the world.

A surge of dread washed through me as Vincent backed closer to the wall in an effort to maintain his distance from Alec.
 I half expected for the incredible tension I'd been feeling before to disappear, but instead it morphed slightly.
 If I hadn't known it was absolutely absurd, I would've said it felt like there was a tingly wind blowing down the stairs, pushing Vincent along before it.
 Isaac moved slightly.
 It was a small change of position, but somehow incredibly menacing.
 It wasn't until Vincent froze in place that I realized Isaac's shift had kept Vincent squarely between him and Alec.
 It was like watching a pair of wolves bringing down an elk.
 I'd seen gangs work together like this before, but it seemed strangely out of place in Sanctuary.
 I was positive there was going to be a fight after all, but then Vincent grabbed some poor freshman, shoved him into Isaac, and pushed his way downstairs as Isaac caught the human missile.

My heart stuttered a little, but I wrenched my thoughts away from where they'd been headed, distracting myself by wondering where Mom was.
 She'd been a little flighty before, but now it wasn't uncommon for her to be gone for twenty-four hours at a stretch.
 In some ways it was hard not having her around, but in other ways it was a relief.
 Sometimes she reminded me too much of Dad and Cindi.
 A surge of guilt splashed around inside me at the thought, but it was a realization I'd made weeks ago.
 By now some of the sharper edges to the emotion had worn away.
 I shrugged, dropping my book and binder on the floor next to my bed.
 Dwelling on the guilt would just make me think about why I felt guilty in the first place.
 I'd find myself on the floor with no memory of how I'd gotten there.

 So he dropped away from his opponent‚Äôs side with speed that his opponent could not match and then stood up in his stirrups and swung his lance into the man.
 That move was similar to one of the moves Doi‚Äôvan had taught him with the quarterstaff.
 A normal lancer did not have the strength to use the heavy lance in such a way.
 His blow landed high and Rodregas drove his lance into the man‚Äôs shoulder.
 Shattered pieces of wood filled the air.
 His opponent flew out of the saddle, an ungainly sight, and landed hard on the arena floor.

I made it all the way to her door before remembering the Jeep hadn't been downstairs.
 Typical.
 The one time I had good news, and she wasn't around.
 I wandered back downstairs, more because it was cooler down there than because I had any real desire to work on homework.
 Once I was down there though, I grimly decided to open up my bag and make some progress before Mom got home.
 I pulled my feet up on the couch, leaned back against the arm and rested my Spanish book on my knees.
 I momentarily wondered if I should make myself quite so comfortable as my eyes closed.
 The doorbell came as an abrupt surprise, waking me from the nap I hadn't intended on taking.
 I'd been in one of the surreal, vivid dreams.
 It was already too distant to remember details, but I had the impression of being on a mountaintop during the day with vision so acute that I'd been able to see the individual motes of dust.

The boys were walking side by side towards the play set.
 It wasn‚Äôt actually that small but it looked that way from the street.
 There were six swings and a tower with four slides attached to it.
 I ran after them with Emily right behind me.
 I slowed down next to Jason and put my arm on his shoulder.
 ‚ÄúHey Jason, do you know Seth‚Äôs a liar?‚Äù I asked and Seth shot me a bad look.
 Jason frowned at me, ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about, Jazell?‚Äù ‚ÄúHe broke his own rules.
 He was out scouting without telling us.‚Äù I smiled and Jason stiffened.
 ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he growled.
 ‚ÄúAre you two trying to create trouble?‚Äù Seth cut in.

 He held a long staff, gripped so tightly his knuckles whitened, and he was dressed in casual traveling clothes that didn‚Äôt seem to fit his posture.
 I found myself questioning whether it were a disguise, and then I chastised myself for wandering around in ridiculous thoughts so often.
 They were watching me.
 Cursed brain fog.
 I stood there for a moment, unsure if I should leave the room after I had so obviously interrupted or pretend I had a mission and make my way to Ruby‚Äôs room.
 I clearly wasn‚Äôt welcome there.
 Neither spoke, so I lowered my gaze to the floor, taking the shortest route to Ruby‚Äôs door and closing it hastily behind me.
 Chevelle spoke to his guest and I groaned internally, wishing I‚Äôd heard their low voices earlier.

I asked her if I could go meet Billy and Cliff.
 Knowing which way they would walk to the office from their auto shop class, around behind the football field, I took that route.
 The teacher was engaged with a carburetor and didn‚Äôt notice me trespassing in his class.
 I found Billy and Cliff wearing goggles, huddled over the head to a Chevy, grinding the valves.
 They had decided Mrs. Bole and whatever trouble they were in could wait.
 They had one more valve to grind.
 Then we stepped out into the sunlight.
 While I gave them the news, Cliff kicked gravel with both feet.

The memories of my mother were fuzzy, but I‚Äôd always thought she‚Äôd had light hair, beautiful and golden like Junnie‚Äôs.
 In the dreams, it was black‚Ä¶ as black as the roots of my hair were now.
 I stood there for a long moment, staring at the darkness, and then spun as I made another stupid, rash decision.
 Slinking past Fannie‚Äôs room, I headed for her makeshift vault.
 She kept all the things I wasn‚Äôt allowed to touch in that room; it was supposed to be off limits.
 Not that I‚Äôd bothered trying much, because there was a large flat stone‚Äîcovering where it hid in the floor‚Äîthat I‚Äôd never been able to move.
 But that was before.
 I wasn‚Äôt sure how the magic had worked with the bird, but I knew it had, so I dropped to my knees, held my hands above the stone, and closed my eyes, concentrating with everything I had.
 Nothing happened right away, and my mind wandered a bit with thoughts of what might be inside, how I wanted to see and needed to touch my family heirlooms.
 The things that belonged to my mother.

‚ÄúRodregas,‚Äù he grunted.
 The knight waited expecting more, but he stopped there.
 He finally shrugged and wrote his name on the scroll in front of him.
 Rodregas‚Äô heart froze as the sorcerer stood and strode over to the table.
 He reached out and casually touched the shoulder of the Knight Captain.
 ‚ÄúCaptain Intreg, do you mind asking a few questions to confirm his status?‚Äù The Knight seemed uncomfortable under the hand of the sorcerer but nodded and said to Rodregas, ‚ÄúWhat is the eighth law of Chivalry?‚Äù ‚ÄúThou shalt never offer combat to someone who is not equal in strength, unless in defense of the honor of the Order, for Justice for the oppressed or in defense of the weak,‚Äù he answered.
 Captain Intreg nodded and then asked, ‚ÄúA question of law: two messenger couriers stop at a keep with priority messages and switch out horses.
 The local lord finds that both horses are lame and are no longer any good.
 One of the messengers is from a neighboring lord and one from the Guild of the Celestial Path.

 ‚ÄúOw,‚Äù I yelped.

 The larger pieces smashed his body from side to side, which turned limply with each blow.
 When the wave passed, Aurelia leaned on one knee, gasping for air as she stared at the man in black, now a crumpled mess of robes in the center of the street.
 The body suddenly convulsed, the chest heaving in quick, jerky spasms.
 When the sound reached her, Aurelia knew her doom.

Liberal democracy and economic opportunity for all are essential ingredients for winning the war against terrorism.
 Accepting the spiritual principle which tells us that there is an element of truth even in the most outrageous or misinformed viewpoint, we must not only vehemently condemn but also sincerely recognize the unaddressed issues that underpin the urge for violence.
 In this sense, terrorists crudely expose the mental insincerity prevalent in international politics.
 Those who wield national power must come to realize that force of compulsion will not bring about a permanent reconciliation and amelioration of relationships in human affairs.
 Superior power must bring with it a superior sense of fairness and a commitment to constructive dialogue and action to attack the root causes of terrorism.
 It must shed its own accretion of mental insincerity cloaked as diplomacy.
 Then and then only these movements of violence will shrink and finally disappear.
 The period following September 11th, as US National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice put it, is one ‚Äúnot just of grave danger, but of enormous opportunity.‚Äù
 Resolving Local Conflicts: The Commission concluded that the end of the Cold War made it possible to successfully resolve problems that had resisted solution for decades, such as the many violent communal and ethnic conflicts occurring in the world.
 The near total cessation of violence in North Ireland during the past 10 years is proof that rapid progress can be made on issues involving apparently intractable communal sentiments.

 After those attempts failed, she gave us ten dollars and a shopping list.
 After we staggered through the aisles at the grocery store and delivered the bags to Evelyn, we drove up Mount Helix to the highest place in our town and paced around the big cross in the mountaintop park, staring all around at Mexico, the Pacific, and the Laguna Mountains.

 She writhed beneath his weight, moaning.
 She'd never be able to leave him once they'd made love.

All she wanted to know was why they couldn't at least have dinner together tonight.
 He'd said he had to work, but it was Friday, and he had to eat anyway.
 But her persistence had made him lose his temper, and now she was rapidly losing hers.
 "I'm sorry having dinner with me is such a burden on you," she snapped, turning to leave.
 Davis grabbed her arm, pulling her around to face him.
 "Don't talk to me like that!"
 "You shouted at me!"
 "You deserved it."
 She glared at him, trying to wrench her arm free.
 "You're hurting me."

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cited reasons for concluding that actual gains may be significantly higher than these estimates.
 New engines for global economy: Economic growth in the developing world is projected to remain strong throughout the decade, averaging 4 to 5 per cent per year in low- and middle-income countries.
 At a time of slackened demand and low levels of growth in most industrial nations, developing countries have become the principal engine driving expansion of the global economy and employment generation, whereas until recently the Third World was perceived primarily as a drag on the world economy or a threat to jobs in the West.
 The potential for much higher rates of growth in these countries, as recently achieved by China, can result in much larger flows of capital, technology and organizational know-how.
 Recognition of this opportunity should be central to the strategy of industrial nations for stimulating their own job growth.
 Advancing technology: The pace of technological development continues to accelerate.
 The application of biotechnology in agriculture offers significant opportunities to raise productivity and generate higher incomes for farmers.
 Medical biotechnology is opening up the prospect of longer, healthier lives of better quality for the elderly.
 Over the next 40 years, child mortality is expected to fall to half its present level and life expectancy is projected to rise by 10 per cent.
 The shift to renewable energy sources and reduced material consumption in manufacturing can lighten the environmental burden of economic growth.

e, industrial nations will have great opportunity for the development92m of0m new technologies and new methods for manufacturing and developing new products. This is essential to the accelerated92m and0m sustainable growth of the future.<eop> The world will92m have0m great opportunities in its own economic development.

This was highlighted by the similarly colored silk toga he wore.
 He wore no rings or accessories, his outfit simple, but extravagant.
 Van‚Äôdret suddenly wished he had thought to dress simpler for the occasion his green and emerald outfit with its gold trim seemed garish in comparison; and his human male form that normally seemed attractive and robust seemed ungainly and drab in comparison.
 Taiga‚Äôs manner continued to be friendly but inquisitive.
 The conversation started with a polite discussion on new spells that Van‚Äôdret was working on, and then moved to his thoughts on the recent political and economic tensions with the Romig Empire.
 Wine and food appeared on the table; Van‚Äôdret never saw it come, or the empty plates go.
 It simply was.
 The food, like everything in the tower, was of the finest quality.
 They were fed incredible grilled silver salmon, greens from the Northern Kingdoms, and small pastries from the Korin Islands.

Good.
 She could go kiss Rick.
 She smiled to herself, thinking about how sweet he was to her.
 Already she was feeling better about ending her betrothal to Davis.
 She wanted a man who would spend time with her and hold her and make her feel safe and cherished.
 A man like Rick.
 Tears filled her eyes yet again, and she snatched up a tissue to dab at them to keep from ruining her make-up.
 Rick loved her.

The dark fire already burned.
 He saw the face of his master, and the sick grin there horrified him.
 ‚ÄúI will not die!‚Äù he shrieked.

 His flesh burned in fire, his bones blew away as dust on the wind, and only an empty robe remained of the being that was Velixar.
 Yet, still haunting the wind, was his final cry, a promise to the world of Dezrel.

"I won't kiss you like I did yesterday.
 But I want you to know how very much I love you."
 She smiled, raising her lips to his for a brief kiss.
 As she wandered off, Rick focused his mind on the TV shows they'd watched last night.
 He replayed all the details of the plots, being sure that he saw, in his mind's eye, all the colors.
 Then he began thinking about planes, remembering his trip with Marie to Los Angeles.
 Then he thought about all the computer programs he used and how to troubleshoot them.
 He'd just started listing microwave products in his mind when Marie returned.
 He rose and went to hug her.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, immediately kicking himself for his hypocrisy.

People were still trickling into the room, so at least I was spared the full gantlet, but the few gazes I met were still unfriendly until I reached the last table.
 The skinny-ish blond girl already at the table smiled at me as I sat down.
 "Hi, I'm Britney."
 I didn't know what to make of her.
 She looked like the type who was always on the fringe of the popular crowd.
 She was the girl who was the first to follow whatever fad happened to be in, and the first to turn on someone if it would make her just a tad more acceptable to her peers.
 I mumbled a response, something that wasn't rude, but which couldn't be mistaken as pleading for friendship.
 Those kinds of girls loved to laugh at the 'poor, desperate, friendless' types behind our backs.
 "You must be Adri Paige.
 I hope people haven't been too terrible to you."

Despite my best efforts, I was mumbling so badly I wasn't sure anything I'd said was comprehensible.
 Somewhere in there I'd closed my eyes, so I felt a sluggish, tired kind of surprise when he gently brushed his fingers across the side of my face.
 The sensation was so feathery I almost opened my eyes to verify that he'd really touched me.
 It was too much effort.
 Besides, I didn't really want to know if he hadn't touched me, it was better to just go on pretending he had.
 "I'm afraid that really is the balance of my time.
 I spend time with Rachel of course.

I've had a good run.
 A much better one than most of my friends did.
 If I haven't managed to accomplish what I was sent down to do in the course of almost a hundred and fifty years, then I've nobody to blame but myself."
 "Still, I'm sorry.
 You seem much too nice of a person to have had all of that happen to you."
 "Nonsense.
 If I am kind, it's no doubt because of those very experiences that I would've been the most desperate to avoid.
 I think most of the best people are that way exactly because of the things they've endured.
 Individuals like Dominic, Rachel, and Jasmin don't just happen.
 They're the result of a native goodness being tempered and refined by terrible experiences."

First you side with Rachel against Brandon, firmly putting yourself in Alec's camp, and then you turn around and piss off Alec?"
 I really wasn't in the mood to argue with Britney, so I tried for nonchalance.
 "So now I'm not on anyone's side.
 They'll both leave me alone and I'll be fine."
 "Oh, yeah, because that's how things work."
 I'd only thought Britney was mad before.
 She was all but shaking with fury now.
 "Don't you get it?

The elf blocked.
 His sword was elven-make and had been wielded in his hands for two hundred years.
 Never would he have guessed Harruq‚Äôs were older by three centuries.
 Never would he have guessed that those two blades would shatter his own, pass through the explosion of steel, sever his spine, and cleave his body in two.
 The half-orc continued his charge, engaging the two elves behind.
 They struck as one, their swords aiming for vitals high and low.
 Harruq knew he could not block both, so he accepted a thrust curving to the side of his armor, grinning darkly.
 As the sword punched through the enchanted leather, the half-orc cut his adversary‚Äôs throat, using that same swing to parry the other attack away.
 The remaining elf swore as his eyes grew red and watery.
 He backed away from the half-orc, his sword held defensively before him.

Rick scooped her up and sat down with her on his lap.
 "Please don't cry, sweetheart," he pleaded, kissing her hair.
 He opened his mouth to tell her that she might not even be able to get back, since she'd been unsuccessful so far.
 But that would just hurt her more.
 Still, the thought calmed his own turbulent feelings.
 When her tears were exhausted, Marie rested quietly in Rick's arms.
 If they had been in 1927, everything would be different.
 Rick was so much warmer, so much more thoughtful and loving and fun than Davis.
 She would never have given Davis a second glance if she'd known Rick in 1927.

In fact, it was perched half way down a gentle valley.
 Farther down the valley, only a few minutes‚Äô ride away was Raven Town.
 Even the kindest of folk would admit the town was not much more than an inn, a stable, the homes of the people that supported the local farming community, and of course, Raven Keep.
 Many of the keep employees and their family members lived in Raven Town.
 Luckily for Rodregas, there was a turn off almost immediately that let him circle around the edge of town and then start heading out of the valley.
 He went north toward the town of Cruet.
 As dusk was falling there was little traffic.
 Luckily this part of the road was well cleared and open and the horses were fresh so he made headway even as it became dark.
 He pushed hard until he reached the fork that headed west up into the hills.
 It was seldom traveled by anyone except fur trappers.

They were tall and lean, dressed in robes the color of ash that only accentuated their shocking silver hair.
 I was convinced the moonlight must have been exaggerating it.
 And then I jumped again as, on either side of them, two beasts walked forward to stand just in front of the twinned elves.
 Steed brushed an arm against mine, mumbling under his breath, ‚ÄúYeah, they‚Äôre not from around here.‚Äù I felt myself leaning on Chevelle for support.
 ‚ÄúRhys and Rider Strong,‚Äù he said from behind me.
 They nodded and I was surprised the small gesture also seemed in step.
 A strange whine emanated from one of the dogs as they shifted to sit on their haunches.
 By their size, I might have guessed they were wolves, but I‚Äôd never known a wolf to be tamed.
 Their fur matched the robes of their masters, down to the black trim.
 I couldn‚Äôt be certain in the light, but I thought there was even some silver showing.

Taking in all of those lithe, tan bodies, I suddenly felt incredibly inferior.
 All of the impending skin cancer deaths suddenly didn't seem quite so important.
 I looked away before anyone could see me staring.
 Britney was still looking longingly at a pile of fries.
 When I looked up again Brandon was looking back at me with a smile that communicated all kinds of things I'd always thought you needed words for.
 His expression seemed to say he was glad to see me, embarrassed to be the center of attention, and sorry he couldn't get away from his friends to come over and say hi.
 I felt my face go hot with embarrassment.
 I tried to step behind a pillar before he saw me go bright red, but knew I hadn't succeeded.
 I bit my lip as I realized how spastic I was being.

"To love someone as oneself, in accordance with Christ's commandment, is impossible.
 The love of personality is binding on earth.
 The self stands in the way.
 Christ could do it, but Christ was an eternal ideal, toward which man strives and must strive, by the law of nature.
 Meanwhile, after the appearance of Christ, as the ideal of man in the flesh, it became as clear as day that the highest, the final development of personality must come to this: that the person should recognize and with the full force of his nature be convinced that the highest someone can make of his self is to annihilate this self, as it were‚Äîto give it totally to each and every one, individually and unselfishly.
 And this is the greatest happiness."
 The ocean is cornflower blue, like the sky above the Tia Juana River long ago.
 Far offshore, an oil rig appears to bob.
 And I sense, or at least imagine, that everything we need to know is in that passage I just read.
 We are possessed by nature with the love of self and also with the need to strive toward the Christ ideal, which is annihilation of the self in total obedience to the love of God and others.

A thin line of blood appeared on the half-orc‚Äôs forehead, but he was oblivious to it.
 His hands were around his enemy‚Äôs throat and his strength at its greatest.
 The crunching flesh underneath his fingers was all that mattered.
 The elf behind him retrieved his sword and attacked, his right arm hanging useless, his left stabbing desperately.
 Harruq flung the dying body around by the neck.
 The sword buried up to the hilt in the makeshift shield.
 Harruq dropped the dead elf and lashed out.
 His backhand broke the elf‚Äôs jaw.
 Reeling, the elf staggered back, only able to raise his meager arm above his head.

How could she be so comfortable with a man after only a week?
 They always sat like this now, and they frequently embraced during the day.
 And she loved it.
 She didn't have to trick him into holding her, didn't have to dance with him to get his arms around her.
 He liked holding her.
 And he'd been home at 5:30 every day, just as he'd promised--just because he wanted to be with her.
 Davis had never rearranged his schedule for her.
 Rick spent every moment of every evening with her.

‚ÄúHow long can you keep this up?‚Äù the necromancer asked.
 He took out a bag of bones and scattered more than thirty pieces.
 ‚ÄúHow long before you break?‚Äù
 One by one, the bone pieces shot straight at Aurelia.
 The elf dropped to one knee, words of magic streaming out her mouth as fast as she could speak them.
 Her magical shield could halt attacks of pure magical essence, such as the conjured fire, but animated objects were a different matter.
 The magic projecting them would die at her shield but the pieces would retain their momentum.
 The dirt before her rumbled, cracked, and then ascended in a great physical wall.
 On the other side, pieces of bone thumped against it, one after another.

 If we were dead, which was my best guess, why not poke fun at him?
 Seth smiled at me.

My gut felt as if a big snake were coiled inside it.
 My heart was a huge lump of coal.
 I walked faster and groaned and wondered why I couldn‚Äôt weep.
 I thought of how Eric was ten times the human I would ever be.
 If he couldn‚Äôt become Superman, I estimated my chances equaled about the square root of zero.
 Mystery
 All these years, I have believed that in some vaguely Christ-like way, Eric died as a sacrifice.

 As it neared, he apprehended it ever more clearly.
 Two weeks or so he had spent gathering his treasures and giving them away.

‚ÄúShould I order the birthday celebration milord?‚Äù asked the captain.
 The coming celebration had been the talk of speculation for months as well as the object of more than a little betting among the guards.
 Rodregas nodded, his thoughts swirling as he realized that he could use the celebration to his benefit.
 Without looking at the captain he walked toward the stairway, and the captain followed close behind him.
 At the door Rodregas took a deep breath and said, ‚ÄúCaptain, that ceremony did not go smoothly, but the gods once again proved to favor me, and I wish to be generous with the birthday ceremony.
 Tell the purser to pay everyone an extra month‚Äôs wages today and give everyone a week off to spend as they wish.
 Make sure you tell Purser Stevents to be generous.
 I want all staff rewarded, even the kitchen drudges.‚Äù He finished, hoping it did not sound as halting and made up as he knew it to be.

But once shortages are eliminated, the focus on specific commodities becomes a barrier to further agricultural development, because it retards diversification into more profitable commercial crops.
 Contrary to free market theory, farmers in many countries have tended to continue production of traditional crops, even when prices have fallen in response to increased supplies.
 There is still a need for government to educate and encourage farmers to adopt resource-based planning, oriented to national and international market potentials and based on principles of economics, employment and ecology.
 Resource-based planning examines how the available land and water resources can best be utilized to achieve maximum and sustainable economic return to the farmer, which is only rarely the priority of governments in developing countries that tend to focus on production targets for specific commodities.
 This shift can lead to diversification into commercial crops, such as fruit and vegetables, that generate significant increases in on-farm employment and incomes and act as a stimulus to downstream agro-industries.
 From minimum needs to maximum potentials
 The factors which have perpetuated commodity-based planning in agriculture have also fostered an emphasis on minimum targets, rather than maximum goals.
 Often government has perceived that its responsibility was to ensure sufficient food to prevent famine, not maximum output and profitability.
 Government machinery has proved effective in forcing through radical measures to disseminate new technology, seed and production methods in the face of crisis, but it usually lacks the driving impetus to work for the highest benefit of individual farmers.
 The shift needed is for planners to study the potentials of the agricultural sector to serve as an engine for job creation and higher incomes, and as a stimulus to industrialization and exports, and then to formulate national goals to maximize exploitation of these potentials.

He moved so fast it took a moment to understand.
 The hood of the cloak was drawn over my head, Chevelle standing a good distance away, facing the trees.

 The tassels decorating their long robes identified them as members of council, but I wasn‚Äôt familiar with the two.
 They mustn‚Äôt have been from the village.

 We shot pool at Mike‚Äôs, where Kerouac had drunk plenty, according to Big Sur.
 We slouched in the catacombs of City Lights bookstore reading apocalyptic poems and hoping for a glimpse of the owner, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the poet who loaned Kerouac his Big Sur cabin.
 We roamed alleys and climbed hills no doubt mistaking mathematicians, who commuted daily to San Jose, for poets or novelists.
 Everybody who looked at home, we imagined had flopped in the Beat boarding houses Kerouac immortalized, or at least listened to the man speak his words in the Cellar, accompanied by a jazz riffing tenor sax.
 We overdosed on espresso.
 Then, as we climbed a hill to recover, I recited a jumble of lines I remembered from Ginsberg's Howl: "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix, wandered around and around at midnight in the railway yard wondering where to go, and loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking visionary Indian angels, and lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup, a hopeless task, and so took ship and disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving nothing behind but the shadow of dungarees and the larva and ash of poetry..." And I recited from On the Road about the children crying in Iowa where they let the children cry and where "the evening star must be drooping and spreading her sparkler dims on the prairie, which is just before the coming of complete night that blesses the earth, darkens the all rivers, cups the peaks and folds the final shore in."
 We explored every street and alley of North Beach and drifted into Chinatown, where I imagined us meeting two exquisite immigrant girls.

Doi‚Äôvan must have seen him coming from his position and he dropped his bow and pulled his great sword.
 The guard must have been thinking ‚ÄúForest Nymph‚Äù due to the nature of the archery attack from the forest because he was unprepared for the strength of the blow.
 Like the one Rodregas had hit, the sword failed to cut armor.
 The guard, with the speed of his sigil, blocked it.
 But he blocked it sword to sword instead of using the momentum and speed to simply guide the sword away from his body.
 The resulting blow had an unpleasant sound and cut right through Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs sword.
 Unfortunately for the guard, Doi‚Äôvan stepped forward as he swung and jammed the lower half of the sword into his opponent‚Äôs chest.
 The guard flew into the bushes with a sickening crunching sound.
 Rodregas next heard the sound of another of the enemy and spun into the sound using all his speed and strength, hoping to take a guard with either advantage.
 His target proved to be a slaver.

Chapter 3 For a moment I was too busy mentally flogging myself to hear Britney's question.
 "Have you been to Vegas yet?"
 "No, we just got here last night."
 And I'd been too busy making doe eyes at gorgeous boys who were completely out of my league to do anything like take a shopping trip.
 Britney perked up at my answer.
 "We¬†so¬†have to go down there soon.
 It's the only place within an hour and a half where you can do any decent shopping."
 Normally the prospect of driving for hours to watch someone else spend money I didn't have, sounded roughly as appealing as laying out naked at the pool until I had second-degree burns on my whole body.
 Then again, maybe burns wouldn't be so bad if they let me disappear into the anonymity of a large crowd in an actual city rather than dealing with hick hostility.
 "That sounds great; I can't wait to get out of this stupid town."

This was their chance for Doi‚Äôvan, and he would get a second chance if needed.
 He looked over at the other two.
 Once Rodregas had turned around from the lion, Doi‚Äôvan started to walk between the pedestals joining Imeralda at looking around.
 He stood in front of the great six-legged stallion, the kind of steed the Gods themselves ride, and then walked over to the Great White Stag of the forest and then to the giant eagle that guarded the Celestial sky.
 It was a sight to take the breath from any mortal, a score of beasts that appeared to have been taken right from the heavens.
 ‚ÄúHow were the greater sigils created?‚Äù Rodregas wondered.
 While the leaser sigils appeared to be simple sculpture empowered by magic, these truly appeared real.
 Yet what magic could capture such powerful beasts for the use of creating sigils?
 Had the greater sigils been gifts to mortals from the Gods themselves?
 Rodregas yearned to reach out and touch to see if they felt like flesh or stone.

But they also evoke images of more people and less work ‚Äì meaning fewer jobs!
 No sooner has the threat of nuclear annihilation receded, than the spectre of chronic unemployment and unrelenting poverty has risen to replace it, giving renewed justification to humanity‚Äôs deepest anxieties by transferring them to a new source of apprehension.
 In recent years, unemployment has emerged as a major cause of concern for governments around the world.
 In industrial countries, the subject evokes pessimistic prophecies of a fast-approaching future in which tens of millions of people will never find jobs, technology eliminates the need for human labour, cheap imports replace domestic jobs, welfare systems collapse under an unbearable burden, children have less economic opportunity than their parents, a widening abyss divides the rich and poor, and both markets and governments are powerless to do anything about it.
 In developing countries, it dashes hopes of ever conquering hunger, eradicating wide spread rural and urban poverty, and bridging the gap that separates these nations from the prosperous West.
 The very same deterministic mentality that until recently made us feel that a nuclear war was inevitable now leads many to conclude that rising unemployment, chronic poverty and social alienation are unavoidable.
 Yet the enormous gains of peace and democracy that we contemplate cannot be secured and brought to fruition if this other apprehension is allowed to become a settled reality, as war between nations has been during past millennia.
 The peace and security we seek internationally depend directly on our ability to promote and maintain domestic peace and tranquillity within nations, which in turn are dependent on the ability of countries to provide food and economic security to their people.
 Poverty and unemployment are closely linked to most instances of social unrest ‚Äì tribal wars, civil wars, urban crime, drugs and violence.
 There is clear evidence from the US and UK that crime is economically related to lack of job opportunities.

ular it is a traumatic experience92m for0m some "post-industrial" nations, especially those of the middle and working92m class0m, which places an enormous burden on society.92m For0m developing countries, unemployment and poverty are the only reliable sources of peace and security.<eop><eod> As the last couple of months have gone by, I92m have0m been thinking about the significance of the success of a second book.

Your syllabus says we're talking about the preterit today."
 The only other person I'd ever met who could've even come close to pulling off such an innocent expression was Rachel, and I wasn't sure even she could compete with Dominic today.
 If I'd found her standing in front of a broken window with a rock in her hand, and she'd told me she had no idea why the window had shattered, all the while flashing me that look, I would've believed her.
 Mrs. Tiggs apparently wasn't quite so gullible.
 "It's a reasonable question, as the two subjects are highly related.
 One could almost say they're so close to the same thing that any distinction is purely arbitrary."
 Now Dominic looked both innocent and confused.
 "But why are they so far apart in the book then?
 I mean my Spanish book in the school before I came here had them pretty widely spaced too."

In times of crisis, great leaders rise to remind us that the true resource is ourselves.
 Thus, Winston Churchill inspired the tiny British nation with the courage to stand and fight fascism when all the rest of Europe had surrendered; thus, Franklin Roosevelt halted the collapse of the US banking system during the 1930s by convincing the people that fear was their greatest enemy and that the basic economic strength of the nation was intact; thus, Gandhi inspired whole generations to fight against colonialism, apartheid and other forms of oppression in a non-violent manner; thus, Gorbachev broke down the psychological barriers to peace and human understanding that had divided the world into two opposing armed camps for four decades; and thus, Deng Xiaoping committed the Chinese nation to provide food and clothing for all its citizens, launching a period of phenomenal economic progress for one-fifth of the world‚Äôs inhabitants.
 These great acts of leadership were fundamentally acts of leadership in thought, of leaders who knew the power of human creativity and determination to achieve what few believed possible.
 It has been our objective to show that now is a time of unprecedented opportunity, provided that we shed the artificial fetters that limit our ideas, attitudes and actions.
 When we rely on external resources, we achieve the minimum because our achievement is based on what we see before us.
 When we rely on the inner resources, we achieve the maximum because we are constantly led to discover more of our own unlimited capacities.
 Why should we wait before acting until we are compelled by the irresistible force of the rising expectations of the world‚Äôs masses, by the explosion of violence in our cities, or by the complete breakdown of our economic systems because of spiralling unemployment?
 Why should we not act now to prevent these outcomes and reverse the trends that threaten to make them a reality?
 All the resources necessary are within our reach, within ourselves.
 We need the courage to think and say that it is time to abolish weapons of mass destruction and call a halt to the use of war for settlement of disputes, that it is time to insist that all people enjoy the most basic democratic freedoms, that there can and must be enough food produced to feed everyone, and that every person must be guaranteed the right to gainful employment.

 With an eager stride, Van‚Äôdret climbed up the stairs to the rooftop solar of the Guild Dealer Taiga‚Äôs tower fortress...
 He was excited by the honor to dine with the great Immortalist.
 He followed a servant dressed in expensive silks of a drab brown color through the well lit passageways and stairs, all the while nervously straightening his own expensive wardrobe.
 As they approached the top of the tower, the servant silently stepped aside and, with an open palm, waived Van‚Äôdret forward.
 The top of the stairs had a small platform where two massive Immortal Guards stood.
 At first they showed no signs of movement, though Van‚Äôdret could feel their eyes on him as they weighed his right to enter the private solar of their master.

Informal private service enterprises in construction, commerce, food catering, repair and transport have vast growth potential.
 Rapid expansion of education, training and public health, especially rural health and education, can also serve as a conscious strategy for employment generation.
 Technology of organization
 Much emphasis is placed on the widening gap in technology between North and South, but the gap in the technology of organization is even greater.
 Creation of new types of systems and organizations can create markets and jobs in many ways.
 The Dutch system of flower auction co-operatives is so successful that 68 per cent of the entire world‚Äôs exports of cut flowers pass through markets in the Netherlands.
 The franchise system has led to a rapid proliferation of new businesses and new jobs in the West in such widely diverse fields as food services, home remodelling, dry cleaning and real estate.
 Industrial estates, export processing zones, export promotion councils, export insurance, warehouse receipts, quality standards, and thousands of other organizational innovations have been either created or borrowed by developing countries to accelerate social progress.
 A comprehensive study of successful systems and institutions that can be transferred and adapted to local conditions will document the enormous untapped potential for stimulating faster economic and job growth by inventing, imitating and further improving social systems.

The political necessity of maintaining popular support and the threat of exposure by the media force elected governments to take all necessary steps to ensure sufficient food supplies.
 Modern democracy is the political counterpart of the market economic system.
 Historically, democracy broke the monopoly of the aristocracy over governance of the people, giving freedom and rights to the individual politically.
 The market system ‚Äì basing itself on property rights and self-determined initiatives of the individual producer and consumer ‚Äì is an economic expression of the same principle.
 Both democracy and market-oriented economies decentralize authority and decision making, providing the essential legal and regulatory framework and empowering the individual to choose and act with minimum direction or interference from above.
 Both depend for their success on the quality of those choices, which means on the quality of education and information possessed by the mass of people, and on the freedom and dynamism of the population.
 In contrast, authoritarian systems and command economies centralize decision making, restrict the flow of information to the public, foster vast unresponsive bureaucracies, limit individual freedom and initiative within narrow bounds, and encourage obedience and conformity rather than innovation.
 The spread of education, which fosters independent thinking, and dissemination of information through the media were important factors in undermining public acceptance of communism in Eastern Europe.

The UN should provide assistance to nations in making the transition.
 2.A major UN Conference should be convened to examine UN institutional reform, including the composition and powers of both the Security Council and the General Assembly.
 The objective should be to restructure the UN according to the same democratic principles advocated by its members for national governments.
 3.As an interim step in this necessary restructuring, the Commission recommends expanding the membership of the Security Council from 15 to 20 members by adding five new permanent members.
 The veto power of the five permanent members of the Security Council should be abolished and the diplomatic status of the UN Secretary General should be elevated to that of a head of state.
 4.A detailed plan should be drawn up by the UN for a further 50 per cent reduction, to a maximum of $400 billion, in global defence spending before the end of the decade.
 Spending quotas for member states should be established according to the principle of non-offensive defence.
 5.The peace-making, peace-keeping and peace-enforcing capabilities of the UN should be strengthened substantially.
 A permanent, well equipped UN force made up from 20‚Äì30 member states should be placed at the disposal of the Secretary General for rapid deployment in conflict zones under Article 43 of the UN Charter to enforce the decisions of the Security Council.
 Either the Military Staff Committee of the UN could be revitalized to give strategic direction to any enforcement action, or a new structure should be created of member states supplying troops to any UN operation, chaired by the Secretary General.

Today it is a Taco Bell.

 A tributary, if you will.
 That first session, so it is told, was as if energy itself had been created in that concrete empty shell, where grass pushed through the floor, straining to catch these new vibes, this new electrical Jubal.

 One evening Eric gave me a sweater and a stack of records.
 Thelonius Monk.
 Dave Brubeck with Gerry Mulligan.
 Lena Horne.
 Harry Belafonte singing blues.
 Though it might take him months to graduate, he said he was anxious to clean things out, to get prepared, ready to move.
 On the evening of Valentine‚Äôs Day, 1963, I stopped by his house and he showed me a sack half full of small candy hearts, with slogans like, ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and ‚ÄúHey, sweetheart.‚Äù He picked out a half dozen that asked, ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù and gave me the rest of the bag, along with instructions for tomorrow at school.

A selfish urge to try and make him ignore the call and continue to focus on me momentarily flared up, but I suppressed it.
 It was such a petty thing to do, and even worse was probably the quickest way to demolish whatever interest he might have towards me.
 I might be almost completely naive when it came to dating, but anyone who'd read more than a couple books, or sat through eight or nine chick flicks, totally knew that the quickest way to drive a guy off was to become controlling and manipulative.
 Unless maybe you were a cheerleader and you were talking about a guy who was used to dating cheerleaders.
 Which while I wasn't even close to the former, the latter actually described Brandon almost perfectly.
 I almost stopped midway through the action of opening my car door, but it was too late.

My wife and I put him on the speaker phone when he calls so we can both share his day with him.
 He has no car so he walks about one mile back on the shoulder of the narrow country road in Werner Springs as he talks to us.
 You can hear the crunching sound of the road‚Äôs gravel beneath his feet and imagine the gait of his walk from the delay between the sounds.
 The need for material objects is no longer what he desires and either are the drugs he once craved.
 We are touched by his compassion, his love and his maturity.
 We look forward to his call nightly and when we hear sirens, we feel sorrow for the parents whose visions are what ours once were.
 Our entire family welcomes our son back and we all realize that no matter how helpless a situation like drug addiction seems we now know that there is help, professional help.
 Most importantly, there is hope where there is love and there is love where there is family.

The house seemed empty but I didn‚Äôt check.
 Heart pounding, I went directly to my room and closed the door behind me.
 The single flame still flickered above my bedside table, and as I walked closer, I noticed a package on my bed.

The sorcerer spoke with a command that dripped venom, ‚ÄúOn your knees Hellborn and swear the oath of fealty, in the name of the All-Father to this squire where we can all see.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan paused for a heartbeat and then pulled his sword out in a smooth gesture and for a moment Rodregas was thinking that a battle was to be had, but then Doi‚Äôvan dropped to his knees in front of Rodregas.
 He took the sword onto his arms as if in morning sword meditation and spoke the words of the Oath.
 ‚ÄúBy my mortal blood and sweat and tears do I swear my fealty to the Squire Rodregas in the name of the Father of Ocean, Sky and Earth.‚Äù Rodregas nodded and responded as was required, ‚ÄúAs the All-Father protects and guards his people so do I swear to do my best to live up to your oath in the Name of the All-Father.‚Äù Rodregas reached down and picked up the sword across Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs arms and lifted it up.
 ‚ÄúAs I lift your sword up, so do I lift up your honor and make it mine.‚Äù As he finished the oath he handed the sword back to Doi‚Äôvan, who responded with the final, ‚ÄúMy arm shall be your arm, my sword your sword, my honor your honor.‚Äù Rodregas had expected to have to claim his followers as Oath Bond, but a knight would never have demanded to see the oath.
 He felt guilt seize his stomach at having been mistaken and knowing Doi‚Äôvan had been forced to swear the oath, due to not wanting to blow their cover.
 Rodregas swore to himself that he would lift the oath as soon as they could be free, but the fact that Doi‚Äôvan had trusted him enough to say such an oath out loud, which could put his very soul in jeopardy, was a powerful statement to their growing friendship.
 Rodregas looked back at the sorcerer who actually seemed surprised at watching the oath sworn, ‚ÄúSatisfied, Sir?‚Äù The sorcerer waved his hand and without a word went back to his chair sitting down as a king to his throne.
 The Knight Captain called for a squire, who he commanded to find them a room.
 Rodregas sensed that the Knight Captain was not happy with what had happened, but he said no word of apology.
 As the three were led away, Rodregas asked the boy the name of the sorcerer at the table.

This was the end of the sixties.
 There was talk of a concert in upstate New York that was gonna blow everybody away.
 And we had just signed on with Pete Holder, who was both lawyer and agent.
 Well, Pete said, he thought he could get us in on this New York concert.
 He was talking to Bill Graham, who was bringing in some new acts, one of which, I remember was Cocker, who nobody knew.
 And Graham was kind of holding the proceedings hostage, making demands, etc.
 And Lennon was going to play, they said, but Hoover, that bastard,  was keeping him out of the states, and, anyway there was all this legal maneuvering going on, and, somehow, it just never happened.
 You know, if Black Lung had played Woodstock it would have been a different history, right?

Had the greater sigils been gifts to mortals from the Gods themselves?
 Rodregas yearned to reach out and touch to see if they felt like flesh or stone.
 But, to do so would set his path for the rest of his life.
 If he was truly strong enough for two as Imeralda thought, then he could be a lion and what else?

 ‚ÄúI am going to choose lion, but it would be great to have a pride, or maybe the Moon Wolf or the Mountain Bear.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan nodded and walked over to the bear.
 It was a kind of bear that Rodregas had not heard of in the mortal world, even larger than ‚Äòhis‚Äô lion.

 They used to tell me all kinds of crazy stories.
 After they were killed nobody would really talk to me.
 Everyone was polite, but it was like I was shut out, like they blamed me for what happened."
 Britney paused for a second and then shuddered.
 "I was supposed to have been with them."
 My shoulders suddenly relaxed as everything started to make sense.
 There'd been an attack of course.
 There might have even been a bit of a cover-up by local, or regional, authorities, but Britney's father was probably right in assuming the motivation had been protecting the tourist industry.
 That was all straightforward, but even that wasn't as obvious as the fact that Britney was suffering from some kind of survivor's guilt.

He stopped shaking as he considered what he'd done to the poor tree.
 "You're saying that because you're worried for me?
 Not because you really want to go back to him?"
 I shook my head, as confused by his reaction, by how close he'd come to losing control, as I was by my not having felt threatened.
 "No, I want to stay, but how can I knowing it will mean you're going to be fighting to the death?"
 Alec tossed the branch away with a sigh.
 "I've spent years learning control, but sometimes I still forget just how breakable everything around me is.
 If you go back to Brandon, you support his claim that you belong to him, and I'd still be forced to challenge him.
 If I didn't, he would be justified in killing whichever two of my friends he wants."
 "So there's no way you can avoid fighting him?"

Do you need to get warmed up?‚Äù A little flame of fire flickered to life in her palm.
 I gave a shaky laugh.
 ‚ÄúNo, I'm not that kind of cold.‚Äù She put the little flame out.
 ‚ÄúAh, I know what you mean,‚Äù she said and hugged me.
 ‚ÄúI'm feeling the same way.

It felt light and a little awkward.
 Rodregas focused on his breathing.
 He had five targets and five arrows.
 He shot at the target shaped like a man.
 The arrow sailed over its right shoulder.
 Rodregas started to tense up, but knew that would kill any chances of hitting his next targets.
 He released the second arrow at the crouching man and the arrow hit low to the left, but he did hit the target.
 He nailed the next standard target almost in the middle, but missed the last two completely.
 Rodregas was among those who were first out of this round of the tournament and spent the rest of the day watching the archery competition.
 The only relief he felt was that only one of the other winners with the yellow ribbons on their arm also gained a second one.

Still at a loss for words, I just nodded.
 I started towards the door as soon as I was dismissed, but stopped at the threshold.
 "Is everything okay Mrs. Campbell?
 I mean it seemed like you were really worried when you left."
 I trailed off, worried by the measuring look that she gave me.
 "I don't suppose you're one of the gossipers, and I guess it wouldn't really matter if you were.
 I got a call that my daughter had been in a car accident.
 By the time I made it out to my car she'd called to tell me she wasn't hurt, just shaken up.
 So, in answer to your question, yes, everything's all right.

Snuggling up closer to him, she sighed.
 ‚ÄúIf it weren‚Äôt for you, I'd have no idea that it's possible to be so comfortable with a man.
 And your kisses .

 She blushed just thinking about how they made her feel.
 He kissed her lips softly.
 "Do you know what my life was like before you came?

 I was really lonely, but I'd just about given up.

She's mine, and I have every right to do whatever I wish to her.
 Her presence among your pack is a direct affront to my rights and honor.
 I could demand your life, be glad I'm only requiring two of your pack."
 Alec shook his head, face more emotionless than even a second before.
 "By the same laws set down by Adjam and Inock when they first took mates from among the dayborn, I challenge your bond of Ja'tell.
 I challenge your standing among the people, and your personal honor.
 The dispute between us is such as can only be settled by blood."
 For a brief second it seemed Brandon had been taken by surprise, but he regained his equilibrium while I was still trying to understand what was being said.
 He closed the distance between himself and Alec with such quickness that for a second I thought they were going to fight then and there.
 For the first time I realized just how much bigger Brandon was than Alec.

I tried to distract myself by looking around, and then felt my face heat up as I realized I'd fallen asleep in Alec's room.
 "I'm so sorry, Alec.
 Donovan and Rachel told me you had copies of our textbooks in here.
 I was studying and must have fallen asleep.
 Please don't think..." I felt tears start to gather at the corner of my eyes, but there wasn't any way to tell whether they were attributable to simple terror, acute embarrassment, or a combination of the two.
 Alec's arm was back, and he gently hugged me against his chest.
 "It was all just a dream, and you don't have anything to be sorry about.
 I don't mind you being here.
 I'm sorry I had to leave you alone for so long, it was inexcusable."
 I wanted to say something, wanted to tell Alec he didn't need to worry about me, that I'd spent enough time by myself lately to be happy with my own company, but the words wouldn't come out.

ouldn't help but blame myself. "I just92m was0m trying92m to0m get some sleep. I don92m'0mt want to wake you up and wake me up.

Let us return to Woodhaven, for this place of death turns my mouth sour.‚Äù
 The two took to the air and joined the other survivors.
 They did not try to locate their dead among the hundreds of other rotting bodies.
 Instead, a few elves flew low and scattered firestones, small pebbles that burst into flame upon landing.
 Grass and bodies ignited, and the battlefield rapidly swelled into a giant funeral pyre.
 Qurrah crawled out from underneath the body as flames erupted all around him.
 Everywhere he looked, he saw embers and corpses.
 He spotted the robes of Velixar and ran to them.
 He picked them up and shook them, furious that no body remained.
 ‚ÄúYou lied to me, Velixar,‚Äù Qurrah said.

I held up my form, which she took without reading it.
 "No doubt something to ensure I know you're my newest student.
 Sit over there where you won't distract Britney from just how poorly she's doing in my class.
 There's an extra book on the shelves in the back."
 Britney rolled her eyes as she went to her assigned desk, but I suspected she was actually relieved we'd been split up.
 Mrs. Campbell didn't seem like the kind of teacher you could get away with ignoring, so I retrieved an algebra book from the back of the room and sat at my desk.
 Any thoughts about finding out why hiking was off limits quickly melted away once class started.
 Math had never been my favorite subject.
 I'd always managed to pull A's or at least A-'s, but hated all of the little nitpicky rules.
 Unfortunately, after missing a whole month of classes, I was at least as bad off in Algebra as I was in Biology.

Unfortunately, things had gone far amiss and he had never known success.
 Rodregas shook his head.
 He was focusing on the distant past, not his duty.
 That is what this meditation was all about, so what was his duty now?
 Killing Immortalists was not something that he, or even the three of them together, could just start doing.
 The problem was not just the individual Immortalist; many an angry town would have killed the local Immortalist Sorcerer after having their people taken.
 Anyone that struck back at an individual Immortalist would face the wrath of the Guild of the Celestial Path, which included not just the god-like power of the Guild Master and his various sorcerers, but also the army of the Guild known as The Immortal Guards.
 While not a large army, they were the most feared warriors in the world.
 The leader of The Immortal Guards was called the Commander General, and Rodregas knew of his deeds and background though he had never met him.
 General Rigoria had once been the Grand Marshal of the same Knightly Order that had trained Rodregas.

After a little more time there, I acted as if I‚Äôd lost interest and headed home.
 Tomorrow, I will follow the tracks.
 I will find whoever was there and solve the mystery of their rudimentary tools and strange huts.
 I yawned.
 After a quick glance around, I slid the book back into my pack.
 I rolled over and fell asleep listening to Ruby‚Äôs quiet tune.
 The next morning, the group seemed in unusually high spirits.
 I had no idea why the mood had shifted, but I enjoyed the laughter and joking anyway.

Of the two, Prom was the more deadly.
 Valentine's Day was usually filled with enough examples of guys screwing up to make me feel okay.
 They were always picking the wrong present, forgetting to buy one, or otherwise making the day less than perfect.
 That in turn helped me remember that most relationships seemed to be more fuss and mess than they were worth.
 Why get something built up so much in your mind that you can't possibly ever realize it?
 All of the little things about Valentine's Day that grounded me in reality were overcome by the mystique of Prom.
 Instead of people fighting, there were dozens, sometimes even hundreds, of couples who all seemed to be very much in love.
 Everyone got to dress up and go dancing in a place that'd been transformed into another world.
 Even before I'd gotten old enough to attend Prom, I'd still invariably spent the day grouchy and depressed.
 Things only got worse as I'd aged, presumably because I wasn't really as indifferent as I liked to pretend, and I couldn't hide behind the excuse of being too young to be asked anymore.

People had already died over what was going on here.
 It hadn't been real, either because I hadn't examined Simon and Nathanial's lifeless bodies, or maybe because I was repressing the experience like I'd done with so many other parts of my life lately.
 I could feel my mind trying to shut down, hoping to cushion me from the worst implications of what was coming.
 I knew it was going to be bad, could feel it in a sickening, only-seconds-away-from-vomiting kind of way, but couldn't follow the chain of logic through to the very end.
 I let Jasmin help me pull my books together, and then numbly followed her out to the hallway.
 Alec and the rest of the pack were waiting for us at my locker.
 Jasmin calmly opened my locker and put my things away while I was still trying to come to terms with everything.

Brandon‚Äôs girlfriend, Tiffanie had already been in a thirty-day rehab twice before.
 We had heard plenty of horror stories from her about her stint in the county rehab: Apparently, several people had over-dosed on drugs while in the facility, one had died, and she had relapsed and used Oxy while she was in there.
 The problem with a facility that accepts court ordered patients is that the patient doesn‚Äôt want to be there.
 They are basically given the option of jail or rehab and they make the clear choice.
 Drugs were as easy to get as a pudding cup inside these places.
 We kept shopping for a place that could assure us that we just weren‚Äôt introducing our son to more drug addicts who would help each other continue their abuse.
 Every agency we contacted seemed to be selling something, and they were pushy and wanted money transferred to them now, offering to pick Brandon up immediately.
 We felt like we were buying a used car from some slickster.
 We didn‚Äôt have the money for what most of these places cost but we knew he needed their help or he could be just another statistic.

Brandon stood up.
 Bryce glared into Brandon‚Äôs eyes, and in the room‚Äôs dead silence Bryce laid the drugs and the burned black-sketched foil on the counter like it was a dead animal.
 I stood in front of Brandon, looking slightly up at him, as he is taller than me.
 The room was silent and everyone awestruck.
 After what we just went through with him‚Ä¶ I looked Brandon in his guilty darkened eyes and I said, ‚ÄúPrepare yourself to find out what will happen to you every time you lie to me‚Ä¶ are you ready?‚Äù Before he could reply or even contemplate my words, I felt the crack of Brandon‚Äôs nose on my knuckles and he flew backwards off his feet.

I mean if she was a royal wolf and you hadn't manifested your hybrid form yet did she win all of the fights?"
 Alec rested his cheek on the top of my head.
 "Not exactly.
 If she'd been a little more heartless she probably could have killed me and cowed the rest of the pack.
 Even then though, it was becoming pretty clear that we couldn't have two separate packs in such close proximity.
 The need to keep the pack strong meant that even though she pretty much ran the show most of the time there was the occasional thing that I'd just refuse to back down on."
 His muscles tightened unconsciously, like maybe he was remembering past pains.
 "She'd rip me up one side and down the other but on the most important stuff I'd simply out stubborn her.
 When the dust settled usually I at least got a compromise we could both live with."

It was bad enough that my heart was shattering as I said it, the look in Alec's face made everything a hundred times worse.
 For a second I thought the earth was shaking, but it was Alec, trembling much like he'd done Friday night.
 A loud crack from beside us made me jump.
 Alec looked at the branch, easily as thick as my arm, which he'd just torn from the tree we were leaning against.
 He stopped shaking as he considered what he'd done to the poor tree.
 "You're saying that because you're worried for me?
 Not because you really want to go back to him?"
 I shook my head, as confused by his reaction, by how close he'd come to losing control, as I was by my not having felt threatened.
 "No, I want to stay, but how can I knowing it will mean you're going to be fighting to the death?"
 Alec tossed the branch away with a sigh.

At first he thought about the implications of what Jordaan had shared.
 But, then his mind went back again and again over his and Imeralda‚Äôs time during the last few weeks and then back to Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs words.
 He knew his friend spoke the truth, but he was not so sure about his ability to do what he needed to keep his relationship with the beautiful AElven Nymph.
 CHAPTER 11 THE NATURE OF BONDS
 The next few days Rodregas and Doi‚Äôvan recovered quickly under the powerful healing magic of Jordaan.
 This is not to say Rodregas did not spend most of his time dreaming that the handsome young Nymph would head back to his own estates.
 They were staying in a small village that seemed to be mostly a forest with small rooms built into it.
 Rodregas could not figure out any set pattern to the place or its boundaries.
 There might have been a dozen or even hundreds of Nymphs living there.
 Though all the Nymphs were friendly, he was still eager to leave.

the first time he had been able to leave the village. He was still concerned about the possibility that Jordaan might remain there.<eop> CHAPTER92m 120m THE DAY OF THE DAY THE DAY OF THE DAY OF THE 92mDAY0m OF THE DAY OF THE 92mDAY0m OF92m THE0m DAY OF The DAY OF THE DAY OF The DAY OF THE92m 0mDAY OF The DAY OF The DAY OF The DAY OF The DAY OF The DAY OF THE DAY

She turned, facing the direction Chevelle had gone, and left me to my discoveries.
 I expected fury from my father.
 He never failed to disappoint me.
 He saw the child, as he called her, as an opportunity.
 I shouldn‚Äôt have been surprised.
 After all, had he not stolen my mother for precisely the same purpose, experimenting with power?
 He did, however, concern himself with where I‚Äôd found a human.
 I refused to tell.
 It was the only gift I could give Noble, his safety.

 That thought filled her with an astonishing sadness.

 She raised her head to look at him in surprise.

The neighborhood is so poor that when my cousin and I delivered a rusted tool shed to one of the families, they used it as a granny flat.
 I was helping the Brothers pass out vegetables when I got blessed with a feeling so profound, the recollection of it still uplifts me.
 These people I was helping, though not on my own but as a paid reporter, were blessing me.
 Like Curly did at Chapters Books.
 And like Mother Teresa blessed me.
 One Saturday a few years back, my friend Diane called.
 As a lay Missionary of Charity, she knew, and whispered to me, that Mother was around, visiting the MC houses in Tijuana and San Diego, in secret like she did, since she preferred not to get mobbed.
 The MCs rise early.
 Diane said Mother would attend Sunday mass at St. Jude's church at 7 a.m. After a late night at a birthday party up the coast, I staggered from bed to my car and blearily followed Diane's directions.
 St. Jude's is near downtown San Diego, in an old flatland neighborhood of two bedroom homes, vintage Chevrolets so lowered so that sparks fly from underneath, plentiful thrift stores, corner groceries and at least one storefront church on every block.

My dreams were wicked that night, all venom and wolves, snakes and beasts, death and fire.
 I woke in my bed, light filtering in through the window.
 The door was open a crack and I could see Chevelle sitting in the front room.
 I was hesitant to face him.
 I lay there, running back through the events of the night, the stories.
 Embarrassment flooded me again and I turned my head to bury it in the blankets, but something strange on the side table caught my attention.
 I picked it up to examine.

 Peace & Security
 Nuclear Disarmament: The threat of a nuclear holocaust remains very real so long as stockpiles of these weapons remain in existence ‚Äì their very existence constitutes a threat ‚Äì and so long as nations or groups insist on the prerogative of manufacturing, possessing and using them.
 While the number of nuclear missiles and bombs has been dramatically reduced, both the USA and Russia retain thousands of such weapons.
 The number of nuclear weapons states has increased and the threat of first use has been extended to Israel, the Indian subcontinent and the Korean peninsula.
 South Africa and some former Soviet republics have voluntarily relinquished their claims as nuclear weapons states.
 Few realize that the catastrophic damage caused by the atomic bombing of Japan at the end of World War II dwindles into insignificance when compared with the destructive power and radioactive fall-out that would result from the explosion of even the smallest nuclear device today.
 Until the last nuclear weapon has been destroyed, the threat of accidental or intentional usage remains very real and very serious.
 The nuclear weapon states must come forward to fulfil the commitments made in the non-proliferation treaties by taking active and immediate steps leading to total nuclear disarmament by all powers within the shortest possible time.

I am not making this shit up!
 In the aftermath of this circus funeral, my mother discovered that Dino had borrowed (or conned) a great deal of money from his father, and Dino‚Äôs siblings were angry and wanted it repaid by my mother.
 The Greek family rumor was that my mother was sitting on a stash of smuggled diamonds and should sell them and repay the loan.
 There were no such diamonds and there was no money.
 Anyone who owed Dino money disappeared into thin air or claimed they had repaid him.
 My mother was also left bearing the responsibility of a huge IRS tax lien and a mountain of bills.
 Mom and 11-year-old Harry were losing everything to the IRS, and it was just a matter of time before they were broke and homeless.
 I went home to help her; after all, I had nowhere else to be.

I felt horrible for my little brother Harry who was ten years old at the time, because they were so close.
 I also felt bad for his aging Father (my Greek grandpa) who was very ill, as this was his only son and his namesake.
 Dino‚Äôs funeral could be a book in itself.
 On the day of the funeral, we went from church to viewing to church to graveyard, always with another sermon or eulogy, with unbelievable crying and hysterics.
 I was in the family limo with my mother, my brothers and poor old Grandpa (Dino‚Äôs father).
 Before I got in the limousine a man walked up to me and introduced himself as Grandpa‚Äôs doctor.
 He handed me a bottle of small white pills and told me they were nitroglycerine tablets and to get one under the old man‚Äôs tongue if he seemed to be having a heart attack.
 Great, Grandpa is rambling in Greek and may die on my watch!

I think the arrest helped him realize how long the police had been after him and how much they knew about him and that dealers he knew were working for the police.
 After rehab when his head was clear, and he knew how close he came to dying or going to prison, I think he respected what the police were doing.
 By then, several more of his friends had died from an OD or were in rehab or prison.
 We chatted and the officers said that they called Brandon the ‚Äúone percent kid‚Äù due to his progress through recovery.
 They also joked about how I was still the talk of the narcotics and uniform officers as this crazy father who went undercover to save his son‚Äôs ass.
 It was an odd gathering but I know the officers enjoyed it and I know they appreciated that their efforts had a positive result on someone.
 While we had Brandon home for this brief time we also attended a family wedding.
 The four of us, Brandon, Bryce, Lisa and myself, drove together several hours north to a coastal town in northern California.
 We all stayed in the same quaint roadside motel near a popular camping spot called Patrick‚Äôs Point.
 It was woodsy and cool and we shared a two-bedroom unit with a common kitchen and a family room with a fireplace.

 "Don't worry, Marie.

 She went upstairs with him and said goodnight outside her bedroom door.
 But her heart began pounding with panic as she thought about the day she'd just spent in 2011.
 She'd worn trousers in town, and she'd embraced a man in public.
 And now she was spending the night alone with him in his house!
 Davis would have a fit if he ever found out she'd been to a speakeasy; he'd refuse to marry her if he found out what she'd done today.

A full mirror lined the east wall.
 I took a few steps forward, staring in disbelief as my figure came into view.
 I had seen the reflection in the water, had known my hair was dark, my eyes a strange shade of green.
 But as I gazed at the woman in my reflection, I could not reconcile the two.
 The dark silhouette, her figure emphasized by fitted clothes, black cape draped behind her‚Äîthis woman was breathtaking.
 I moved closer to examine her, nearly reaching out to touch the windblown sable hair.
 Her eyes‚Äîmy eyes‚Äîwere dark.

Rick spent every moment of every evening with her.
 He'd even refused to play racquetball tomorrow with a friend who called last night because he wanted to spend both Saturday and Sunday with her.
 Marie blinked back tears of confusion.
 She was betrothed to Davis.
 But it was getting harder and harder to remember why she'd fallen in love with him.
 He didn't spend much time with her, didn't hold her very often, didn't do anything really fun.
 And he wasn't nearly as handsome as Rick.
 Rick had beautiful blue eyes and-and a broad, muscular chest that she got to see every morning if she woke up before he did.
 In her dreams, he never had on a shirt, and he was always smiling.

 We spent the rest of the day chasing after mice so we could stomp them and have Qurrah bring them back to do tricks.‚Äù
 Aurelia smiled at the burly half-orc.
 ‚ÄúYou really made them do tricks?‚Äù she asked.
 ‚ÄúWell, yeah, some jumps and flips.

"It's okay, Britney.
 If you want to leave we'll give her a ride home."
 I could see the wheels turning in her head.
 If I really did have a ride, she could leave without ruining things with Brandon; but if I wasn't going to lie, then there was a good chance that Mrs. Campbell would find out she'd left early.
 Parents were relatively easy to fool.
 Leave the tutor lab early, go somewhere else and kill some time until you were supposed to come home, and they'd never know the difference.
 Teachers were a little harder, but if you didn't have the help of your 'friends', then they became an insurmountable obstacle.
 The gears finally ground to a stop and Britney sighed as she put her head down on the table.
 I tried to stop from smiling at her theatrics, but happened to look over at Rachel just in time to see a matching smile on the younger girl's face.
 Before I could look away, Rachel held up the red side of her card.

‚ÄúActually,‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚Äúit is right in the middle of it, and there is even a small undercurrent suggesting that another weaker one crosses at the farm point.‚Äù Rodregas explained, ‚ÄúI had been on the run when we found this place.
 I had been worried that those tracking me were using magic.
 So to keep them off my track I traveled in and out of ley lines to throw off the magic scent.
 This one runs underground before coming out in this small valley.
 I was trying to find the ley line again.
 That is how I found the old farmhouse.‚Äù Ley lines are like rivers of magic energy that encircle the world.
 Most major Immortalist keeps and other magic locations are located either on one, or where two of them cross.
 Magicians love them for all the free magical power just flowing by to use.
 But while there is plenty of power it is not easy to use.
 The power is naturally full of disturbances and chaotic energies.

If you‚Äôre thinking of trying dragon riding as a hobby, I wouldn‚Äôt.
 I fell backwards and landed on Seth who snapped at me to get off.
 I couldn‚Äôt move because we were still going up and if you paid attention in science class, this is usually when you can‚Äôt move.
 It‚Äôs called gravity.
 The dragon righted itself and I scrambled back into sitting position.
 We were gliding high up in the eerie sky and the view was actually beautiful.
 The trees looked like an endless sea of lush green and the sun peeked out from behind the clouds.

Clearly the three human men were eager to get started back to the main road.
 He noticed that the Hellborn Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda seemed to be hanging back.
 As the three men started to head down the road Doi‚Äôvan walked up to Rodregas and stated, ‚ÄúI would rather travel with you.‚Äù That was it; he just stood there like some huge tree after that simple statement.
 Audrian seemed as surprised as he was.
 They both spoke at the same time, their thoughts strangely in agreement.
 ‚ÄúAre you crazy?‚Äù asked Audrian at the same time as Rodregas said, ‚ÄúThat is crazy.‚Äù ‚ÄúLook, the Guild will be after me,‚Äù Rodregas stated.
 ‚ÄúIt will not be safe to travel in my company,‚Äù he added.
 ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù stated the Hellborn in a voice that was so deep it was like stones grinding.
 ‚ÄúBut still, I would travel with you.‚Äù Again he made the statement and showed no interest in explaining his action.

Here, if they succeeded, the three would not be stealing horses, they would be freeing people from slavery.
 Rodregas looked into Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs eyes.
 He was resolute.
 Rodregas felt humbled at the man‚Äôs bravery, at his passion, at his strength.
 Rodregas knew there was no such thing as a hero,  simply people that sometimes choose to do the right thing when it was a hard choice.
 There was no question for Doi‚Äôvan, he simply stood quiet and ready.
 He knew what the right thing was, and he therefore took the right action.
 Rodregas was not Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs equal in spirit, but he knew that though he would likely die that he could not turn away from the Hellborn‚Äôs example.
 Rodregas then turned to Imeralda, her eyes told a different story.

War both between and within states has come to involve and affect all of society.
 Infrastructure and production facilities have become a principal target of military action.
 Food supplies are frequently the first major casualty and most lethal weapon.
 A single explosion can paralyze a major metropolis or contaminate an entire region with toxic material, dwarfing the devastation caused by the industrial accidents at Chernobyl and Bhopal.
 The disruption of trade resulting even from regional conflicts such as the Gulf War or the war in Bosnia, impacts not only on the economies of the belligerents, but also on neighbours, trading partners and global economic performance.
 Neither the victor nor the victim can any longer afford to resolve conflicts violently.
 Political states may still be able to survive wars, but developmental achievements can not.
 So long as the benefits of development are confined to one or a few sections of society, the costs of militarization and war may not prevent economic and social progress.
 But when the need is to fulfil the rising expectations of the masses by extending the benefits of development to the entire society ‚Äì thus enabling the society as a whole to move to the next higher level of collective affluence and fulfilment ‚Äì every social resource must be garnered and harnessed for this purpose.
 The colossal cost of armaments and the catastrophic destruction of war are incompatible with the achievement of prosperity for all.

Sword strikes assailed her impossibly fast.
 Any thought of the fight being practice left Aurelia‚Äôs mind.
 It felt too real.
 She stayed defensive, parrying with all her skill while constantly dancing away.
 Harruq pressed closer, and every time the elf pulled out of a roll or landed from a leap backward, he was upon her.
 Notch after notch covered her staff as the swords chopped harder and harder.
 His strength grew as the fight progressed.
 He held nothing back.
 He weaved his swords through three stabs, feinted a high slash, and then twirled up and around for a low thrust.

It was the thistle I had grown.
 The garden.
 I rushed out, leaving the door open as I had found it.
 I hurried from the village, trying to remember where the abandoned garden was located, almost running under the clouding skies.
 It wasn‚Äôt hard to find because of its new size, but if I hadn‚Äôt been half expecting, half fearing the excessive growth, I might not have recognized it.
 Each of the strains I had grown the day Evelyn choked was flourishing.
 Noxious weeds were taking over the meadow.
 As I stood there, frozen before this changed garden, I was overwhelmed by the scene, overtaken by emotion, and had to press my eyes closed.
 Light rain began to fall and I raised my head to the sky, drawing in a deep breath.

Everything was done in drab, painfully boring colors, overlaid with incredibly vibrant, hues that were almost unreal in their perfection.
 It wasn't until I'd moved around a corner and entered what looked like a new phase for the painter that I figured out why the paintings looked so familiar despite the fact that I'd never seen any of the places or people depicted.
 The realization hit with such force that it distracted me from the familiarity of the signature.
 The new pieces were all breathtaking.
 The drab colors were gone, leaving scenes made up of multi-hued strands of light.
 It was like waking up and having someone tell you they'd been reading your mind.
 The pieces weren't of specific places or events from my dreams, but they were an exact match for how they'd looked and felt.
 I felt my hands start to shake.
 It was like I'd had too much forced on me too quickly.

 Accept Van‚Äôdret had been invited to have lunch with one of the most powerful people on the planet to drop the simply suggestion that he should keep his eyes open for something unusual at the Cathedral of the Heavens.
 The rest of the dinner quickly wrapped up, and Van‚Äôdret soon found himself caught up in thought as he journeyed down several floors to the Great Hall that served as the gathering place for the other Immortalist in residence in the city.
 His questing mind was rudely interrupted by a woman stepping to his side and asking him, ‚Äúso did you ask him?‚Äù ‚ÄúAsk him what?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret asked.
 The Immortalist Sorcerer in the form of a tall athletic human female with spectacular long red hair and blue eyes gave Van‚Äôdret a silent glare before responding.

Rodregas had thought that Jorin was a good lad, well behaved and bright, and his eyes were eager for signs of hope.
 Rodregas brought him extra food and words of reassurance.
 Ravenhurr had no need for him nor his mother, and he had seen other prisoners who were not of use set free.
 Rodregas had thought that Jorin would also be set free.
 Two months went by and Rodregas had developed a strong fondness for the boy; a few of the guards made jokes that Rodregas had a new pet.
 Rodregas was used to the rough humor of soldiers and let such jokes roll off.
 The night came when the father was taken for the ceremony.
 Rodregas was on guard duty when Korin came down in his new body.
 The poor lad had stared at the man who had been his father, saying nothing, but tears ran down his cheeks.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll get it,‚Äù I said, waving my hand to form a fire beside us.
 Nothing happened.
 The vertigo was almost gone now; I was feeling close to normal, just a bit fuzzy.
 I tried once more, but it would not light.
 I pressed down the panic as I concentrated on pulling the burn together.
 But nothing happened.
 I sat up, holding both hands in front of me, palms up, as I focused on lighting a flame, any flame.
 Nothing.
 I reached out to move a rock from the floor.
 It didn‚Äôt budge.

He had a Polish name.
 They all were sharp dressers.
 To them, my traveling wardrobe marked me as a hick and slob.
 So when I arrived in my jeans and flannel shirt at a party to which they hadn‚Äôt invited girls yet they still dressed in alligator shoes and polished chino slacks, at least a few of them took offense.
 The Polish fellow began goading me, first about my clothes, then about the beard I had grown, then about what losers were all us from California.
 I attempted patience, since I was their guest and because I remembered Tony‚Äôs stories that placed him in the low range of this crowd‚Äôs toughness.
 But at last I mouthed a comeback.
 The Polish fellow threw a punch that landed square on my jaw.
 I staggered.
 He tackled me.

‚ÄúI know you don‚Äôt like my servants being a Hellborn and a Nymph,‚Äù he said keeping his voice light.
 ‚ÄúBut they are my sworn men and I trust them; and it is my call.
 Now open the doors.‚Äù At the last part he let a sergeant‚Äôs voice ring out and it was more order than request.
 And like all good soldiers they immediately carried out his order.
 The door had a strange mechanism such as Rodregas had never seen before.
 Gorin lifted a large handle and solid squares of iron slid out of the floor and the ceiling.
 When both the top and the bottom fully released the guard pushed the doors wide.
 The three immediately pushed through and Rodregas said, ‚ÄúYou can close the doors.
 I will pound on them when we are ready to leave.‚Äù And with a nervous nod the doors slid closed behind them.
 As the door closed Gorin hastily added, ‚ÄúRemember not to touch anything until the Grand Marshal is present.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan nodded at the now closed doors and raised his torch.

She pulled me into an open classroom and gave me a hug while I tried to explain about the two failed tests, my birthday, and how much I missed my Dad and Cindi.
 The last bit was especially garbled.
 I was pretty sure she wasn't getting any of it, but that didn't matter.
 All that mattered was I was finally able to tell someone.
 I never really got myself under control; my sobs just subsided enough for me to tell Rachel I wanted to go home.
 Isaac was standing right outside the classroom door, and unobtrusively helped Rachel get me to his car where she jumped into the back with me.
 Even through the haze of tears I could tell he wasn't happy about the seating arrangement, but once again Rachel showed the kind of iron will she'd demonstrated with James.
 Almost before I knew it we were rolling to a stop in my driveway.
 I fumbled, for the latch, but Rachel put a hand on my arm before I could get the door open.
 She handed me a white-wrapped package with a shy smile.

They used magic against their foes not swords, and they seldom got involved in physical struggles.
 Of course Rodregas had known that in The Immortal Guard of the Guild the most loyal and powerful of their officers were given enhanced bodies, but he thought their power lay in their magical sigils.
 His new body was very large and very muscular, and much stronger than he would have guessed.
 Rodregas lifted his right arm and curled it into a tight muscle.
 He felt the biceps with his free hand.
 The texture under the skin felt like bundles of large, powerful cables.
 He felt his face break into a smile; he had seen this face smile when it had been a prisoner.
 The smile the prisoner had worn was a very open charming smile.
 The smile he felt on his face now had little resemblance to the one he remembered seeing, though without looking in the mirror he had no way of knowing for sure.

I was staying with my aunt on Martha's Vineyard for the summer, and his family had a cottage not far from my aunt's.
 He was a student at Harvard during the year, and he was planning to be a doctor.
 We were inseparable from the moment we met.
 We went out to dinner, went to parties, sometimes just sat quietly reading together.
 But best of all, we would walk or sit on the beach for hours talking.
 He was wonderful, and I loved him with all my heart."
 She paused, smiling as she reached out to touch a lock of Marie's hair.

He knew now that he could keep her here, but how could he do that when she wanted so much to go home?
 He ordered Chinese, and Marie came down just after it arrived.
 She saw the cartons and silently went to pour two glasses of tea.
 Rick slid his arms around her from behind.
 "I love you."
 She didn't respond, pulling away from him to carry the glasses to the table.
 With a sigh he took plates from the cabinet.

In one small paragraph he found that the entire article was theory upon theory: no one had ever found a black hole or a wormhole or anything that could travel faster than the speed of light.
 "You didn't miss anything," Rick told Marie, setting the article aside.
 "Scientists think that it would be possible to travel through time by going through these wormholes the author mentions, but it's all theory.
 Nobody has ever discovered a wormhole, and none of this stuff has ever been proven."
 Marie sighed.
 "This book isn't hard to follow, but I'm rather skeptical.
 The author says that thought is the way to travel through time.
 He says that if you concentrate hard enough on getting to the time you want to visit, you can do it."
 "Yeah, I found some ideas about that in the other books I read.
 Maybe--" "But that doesn't explain how I came here.

I‚Äôd never been able to move objects, but it seemed I had done it without thinking.
 And it wasn‚Äôt just that, but the thistle.
 I needed to see Junnie.
 The door was partially open when I reached Junnie‚Äôs house, so I peeked my head in and called for her.
 When she didn‚Äôt answer, I slipped in to check the back room.
 As I walked through the sparsely decorated living area, I passed a carved mirror on the wall and noticed something off in my reflection.
 I knew I was flushed, I could feel the frustration and worry, but I stopped to get a closer look.
 There was something not right with my complexion, but what was really off was just above my face.
 I squinted, leaning toward the mirror as my hands reached up of their own accord.
 The first quarter inch of my hair was blackened.

In a departure from his normal routine, Alec was already seated when I arrived.
 I flipped open my notebook and tried to distract myself with a brief sketch, only to tear the page out and ball it up as the bell rang.
 I looked up to see Alec staring at me, which just made me mad.
 It was completely unfair.
 I wasn't going to get to go to Les Mis√©rables, but he was rich enough to fly to New York and book the whole theater.
 As Mrs. Alexander stood up to take roll, a burst of static silenced us all.
 "It's my pleasure to read off the names of the five winners in our drawing for tickets to Les Mis√©rables."
 "The first winner is Pam White."
 Somewhere down the hall I heard someone yell, and then an entire class broke out into cheers.
 I knew I should be happy for Pam, but I was too busy wishing everyone would quiet down so we could hear the next name.

I started around the vehicle, stumbling and nearly falling before I finally made it to my destination.
 Brandon waited for me to get my seatbelt on and then gunned the engine, flipping around a hundred and eighty degrees in a maneuver I'd never seen anyone perform outside of the movies.
 "Of course I don't have to pick you up.
 It's more a matter of wanting to, if I can say that without making things all weird.
 I have obligations at school, people who depend on me.
 I can't spend the time I'd like getting to know you there, so it just made sense to free up some time in the mornings to make that happen."
 Everything was just too unreal.
 I couldn't believe it was all happening, so I chose to ignore the implications of what he was saying.
 Boys like him didn't go for girls like me.
 They didn't even acknowledge the possibility unless they were after something.

But when she could again talk with her mother, there'd be no point.
 Rick would be gone.
 That thought brought tears to her eyes, and she snuggled closer to him, wishing she could have everyone she cared about in the same decade.
 They spent the afternoon watching TV, reading, and napping.
 "I feel so lazy," Marie said, stretching as she yawned.
 "It's nice to have a day like this every now and then, though."
 "Yeah."
 She looked at his arms with concern.
 "How does your sunburn feel?"
 she asked him.

 she thought.
 It was tight but not uncomfortably so, and it was pretty.
 But she blushed at her profile.
 She filled the front of the bathing suit, and the curve of her hips was all too apparent.
 To her eyes, she looked bulky.
 She didn't want to go out there and ask Rick's opinion.
 She blushed again at the thought of people seeing her like this.
 But people would see her at the shore tomorrow, so she pushed the curtain aside and stepped out.
 "Rick?"

‚ÄúCan you not see into the room?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúNo, I can see something, shapes flicking in fire?
 I think I smell something like rotten eggs, but I can‚Äôt see well enough to go in.
 And I don‚Äôt know why, but I really don‚Äôt want to go in.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan and Rodregas shared another look and then nodding, stepped out of the chamber.
 The three of them stood silent for a minute.
 Finally, Doi‚Äôvan spoke, ‚ÄúMaybe you need a connection to see the doors and the room?
 All of us worship the Celestials and we were all drawn to their sigils, especially Rodregas.
 I was drawn to the door here, which makes sense.
 This room, like the Celestial Chamber, seems to have similar beasts of the Infernal realm.
 Rodregas was also drawn to a lesser extent, which might indicate that we were right about Ravenhurr experimenting with Infernal power.

 As soon as we were out of earshot, though I was still being dragged by the arm, I asked Chevelle, ‚ÄúDid something happen with the twins?‚Äù Ruby laughed.
 We both stared at her.
 ‚ÄúTwins,‚Äù she scoffed.

 In the quiet, Dieredon entered the light of the fire.

 Would you not sleep in safety rather than in the wild?‚Äù

They reached the western gate, which remained open during the day.
 Without ceremony, they were kicked through, both falling to the dirt and scraping their knees.

 It was not just adrenaline that caused Harruq‚Äôs hands to shake, but Qurrah put his hand on his wrist and begged him to calm.

Her actions highlight that she is seriously addicted and that is not comforting when I am taking her word that Steve is a trustworthy drug dealer, as if there is such a thing.
 Another car approaches and it is white, but I cannot tell the make of the vehicle.
 As it passes, I check it out and see that it is a woman with two small children.
 She is handing a baby bottle towards a car seat in the back.
 A young boy sitting in the front passenger seat stares back at me as if to say, ‚ÄúWhat are you looking at?‚Äù I was once that baby in the backseat and my brother that inquisitive one in the front.

I personally was glad he couldn't go along, and not just because it was dangerous work.
 I wasn't positive he'd really come to terms with having killed Brandon.
 "They'll be fine.
 You need to worry about getting better, and nothing else."
 My pout met with just as much success as it usually did.
 After a second or two I gave up and nodded.
 "Okay, I promise to be good and concentrate on getting better, if you'll come keep me company."
 The flash of emotion, barely visible in Alec's eyes, was a source of hope and despair all at once.
 Eagerness, desire.
 Both curbed by the same iron will that'd continued fighting long past where most people would've given up and died.

 She‚Äôd been only 37.
 Wondering what she‚Äôd died of, he turned the page and found more information about her.
 "Jefferson Tranton handpicked Davis Runyon, heir to the Runyon publishing empire, as a husband for his daughter.
 Chandler Runyon had sold the business when his son was 19 years old so that, in actuality, Davis Runyon was heir only to the family fortune and to the power of wealth, not to the power of position.
 Eager for such, he courted both the young woman and her father.
 Tranton and his son had had a falling out when the younger Tranton had begun his own company in 1925, and because he had disinherited his son, Tranton began grooming Runyon to run his company as well as to become his son-in-law.
 In February 1927 Runyon became vice president of the import/export enterprise, and seven months later he married Tranton's daughter.

I turned back around and started back where I left off, but then a body slammed into me.
 I just had enough time to see the thrasher, before the fur and dirt filled my vision.
 I spit out the clump of wiry hair that had somehow found its way into my gasping mouth.
 I felt a searing pain as the Thrasher raked my left leg.
 I closed my eyes against the pain, trying to focus myself against the dull throb in my shin.
 Then the thrasher went limp against me.
 It was hauled off of my body and I found myself looking up into the face of a very unhappy dark blue haired boy.
 His sword was gripped tightly in his clenched fingers and a look of amusement, or many it was anger, shone on his face.
 I swallowed and collected my weapons from the ground, not daring to look at my leg.

I was fourteen and trying to understand geometry proofs.
 Mom had given up trying to help me with homework about the time I turned twelve, so she kept telling me to just read the book and figure out what they were doing in the examples.
 By the time Dad got home from work tears were streaming down my face and I couldn't even see the diagrams anymore.
 "I can't do it, Dad.
 Missy Jeffrys already did the entire assignment before we even got out of class, and I can't even figure out one problem.
 I'm not good enough; I'm never good enough."
 Rough fingers had appeared from outside my peripheral vision, gently smoothing away tears.
 "Come on honey, you really can't expect to do everything by yourself.

 He'd forestalled my next excuse as if reading my mind.

At this stage in their development, it is highly unlikely that food-deficit African nations can make rapid progress toward food self-sufficiency without strong government support and investment to improve technology, training, techno-infrastructure and trade.
 Once the rural sector begins to exhibit its own dynamism, as in the majority of developing countries, there is strong justification for a shift in the role of government from that of prime mover, planner and controller of development to that of catalyst and pioneer.
 Government agencies can tap the potentials of agriculture, identifying new commercial opportunities, educating farmers, demonstrating new potentials, assisting in the transfer and dissemination of new technology, and promoting the establishment of effective organizations ‚Äì preferably privately or co-operatively owned by farmers or at least with their participation ‚Äì to process, distribute and market what is produced.
 Coping with the environmental problems to preserve the ecological foundations essential for sustainable agriculture is an area in which government has special responsibilities and must play a leading role on an ongoing basis.
 Regulating the diversion of prime farm land for non-farm uses, expansion of irrigation capacity, control of groundwater exploitation, major programmes for reforestation and to prevent or reverse desertification, and regulation of pesticide use can only be effectively planned, monitored and regulated by governments.
 Comprehensive Strategies
 In this and previous chapters, we have tried to present an integrated perspective of the political, economic and technological factors that need to be taken into account in formulating a comprehensive approach to the issues of peace, food and employment.
 In an effort to illustrate the potential efficacy of this approach in a country representing nearly 25 per cent of the world‚Äôs poor, ICPF conducted an in-depth country level study in India to evolve a strategy for stimulating massive increases in job growth and food production (see box pp.
 122‚Äì24).

Dark, slithering words flowed from his lips, ominous in the starlight.
 As the minutes passed, the blood on the stones began to glow.
 Qurrah took up his own chant, a single phrase he was to repeat so that the spirit of Ahrqur could not flee once Velixar summoned it.
 ‚Äú _Drak thun, drak thaye, kaer vrek thal luen,_ ‚Äù he chanted.
 A part of him shivered, the words so similar to black words Master had spoken before the hyena-men had come.
 He repeated his designated phrase, feeling the magic flowing from him to encircle the body.
 ‚Äú _Kala mar, yund cthular!_ ‚Äù Velixar shrieked in a voice stronger than his frail form should have possessed.
 The call echoed throughout the night, sending wolves yipping away and night owls crashing in a squawking frenzy.
 The symbols on the body flared to a brilliant crimson.
 A sense of exaltation soared through both necromancers as Ahrqur opened his eyes and snarled.

Though very strong it does not hold an edge well and is seldom used to produce an edged weapon.
 Mithril - a silvery metal that is light in weight.
 It can be beaten like copper, and polished like glass; light and yet harder than tempered steel.
 The metal is magical in nature and can hold enchantments.
 Blue Steel - is a steel and Mithril alloy, that holds an enhanced strength and edge.
 The most powerful of these weapons are Kissed by Fire.

 Molten rock covered the street, splattering across both Velixar‚Äôs and Aurelia‚Äôs shields before sliding to the dirt.
 ‚ÄúHow long can you keep this up?‚Äù the necromancer asked.
 He took out a bag of bones and scattered more than thirty pieces.
 ‚ÄúHow long before you break?‚Äù
 One by one, the bone pieces shot straight at Aurelia.
 The elf dropped to one knee, words of magic streaming out her mouth as fast as she could speak them.
 Her magical shield could halt attacks of pure magical essence, such as the conjured fire, but animated objects were a different matter.

It was hard for him to see.
 He struggled back up, but fell, then Rodregas felt a presence to his right.
 It was too small to be Doi‚Äôvan and Rodregas staggered over reaching for him, determined to take one final slaver with him.
 His wounded leg buckled again, and Rodregas tried to reach for the ground to slow his fall, but something was wrong with his arm and it did not move.
 For a split second he saw the ground coming up to hit him in the face.
 And then... darkness.
 CHAPTER 10 THE OTHER KIND OF PAIN

 They kept talking, settling into conversation.
 Steed offered Chevelle what was left of the roast and they sat, Chevelle beside me and Steed across from us.

I wandered down the white-walled corridor until I found another sign and turned left.
 There was a tall brunette already waiting, so I took a seat in one of the hard-plastic chairs.
 The other girl had shorts on just like everyone else, but hers were the shortest I'd seen yet.
 In Minnesota you could always pick out the alpha females by the length of their shorts, and this one seemed to think she was at the top of the food chain.
 That or a complete slut, but with her tan skin and perfect wavy hair, I figured it was probably the former.
 She didn't look like she had to put out to get attention.
 Two minutes later, a smiling blond secretary came waddling out of what was probably the principal's office.
 I spent the time wondering if I should try to make small talk; the gorgeous girl spent it staring out the window.
 The secretary took in the two of us, frowned almost imperceptibly at the length of the shorts and then signed a form for the other girl.
 Determined to at least try and make friends, I started to smile as she turned towards me on her way out, but the expression died as soon as I met her flat green eyes.

That was not too surprising; since such ex-knights are usually made officers.
 Greater sigils were much more rare in the Guard than the knighthood, not to mention the officers of the Immortal Guard lived in much nicer style than the knighthood.
 ‚ÄúThe Knight Commander might not be willing to stand up to the Immortalists, but he would be more than willing to skip over giving knighthood to someone who was planning to leave anyhow,‚Äù said Rodregas.
 They had made it to the stables and Doi‚Äôvan started to put the saddle and tack onto Doom Hoof, the horse that Doi‚Äôvan had been riding.
 The horse was slow, but big and strong and was the best horse for this kind of combat.
 ‚ÄúSo finally, Karun,‚Äù said Imeralda, ‚ÄúNot too much is known about her; she was an orphan and clearly of the blood and strong.

The sorcerer‚Äôs body language, though, directed his memory to the answer.
 Rodregas said, ‚ÄúThe local lord is responsible for replacing the other lord messenger‚Äôs lame horse.
 There is nothing to be done for the Immortalist messenger‚Äôs horse.
 It is the responsibility of the local lords to provide mounts for the Guild at the local lord‚Äôs expense.‚Äù He made sure his voice remained rough with no emotion coloring his response, just a simple squire giving a by-the-book answer.
 The Knight Captain nodded and said, ‚ÄúWelcome to the tournament, Squire.‚Äù He then turned to look up at the sorcerer and asked him, ‚ÄúAny other questions Ambassador?‚Äù The sorcerer spoke his next question directly to Rodregas, ‚ÄúI noticed you have a Hellborn at your side, you would insult the faith of the Knights by bringing him into the Cathedral of the Heavens?‚Äù Rodregas knew this question would come up and had the natural answer, ‚ÄúThey are my sworn followers.

The album smokes.

‚ÄúI see that you are looking much better,‚Äù said the unknown Nymph.
 Imeralda gave the young Nymph a big hug, one that looked far more intimate than Rodregas was comfortable with and she said, ‚ÄúRodregas, we are so lucky that I was able to get Jordaan to come.
 Durien was working so hard trying to heal you, but your body is so hard to work with.
 He says that the same innate magical ability that makes your body so strong also requires a lot of power to heal.
 Normally Durien can heal even a very seriously wounded person, but he could barely keep you and Doi‚Äôvan alive.
 I had to leave and run to Fariste to get Jordaan to come.‚Äù She was smiling like the sun as she spoke.
 ‚ÄúHe was so good to come and just leave at the last moment,‚Äù she added.
 Rodregas thought she was going to start hugging the Nymph again, but she caught herself and came over to him and gave him a careful hug and started fussing with his pillows.
 Rodregas wanted to pull her closer and inhale her scent.
 He had thought that he was going to die, an experience that Rodregas of late knew too often.

He tried to raise the blade, but all the strength had left his hands.
 He had lost too much blood.
 When Harruq came charging forward, Condemnation red and hungry, all he could do was dodge.

 When he pulled out of the roll, he dashed for a large dresser.
 Inside was a stash of healing potions.
 All he needed was one and he could fight again.

My heart stuttered when he leaned in, our faces unbearably near.
 Just before he touched me, his cheek slid alongside mine, his mouth at my ear.
 I froze as he spoke low, his breath on my neck sending a shiver through me.
 ‚ÄúStay.
 Still.‚Äù He was gone.
 He moved so fast it took a moment to understand.
 The hood of the cloak was drawn over my head, Chevelle standing a good distance away, facing the trees.
 I was watching him as two men drew near.
 I hadn‚Äôt seen them; they must have been concealed, or camouflaged by magic as I had been days before.
 The tassels decorating their long robes identified them as members of council, but I wasn‚Äôt familiar with the two.

So yeah.‚Äù
 The elf looked him up and down, sending chills roaring along his spine.
 It seemed so strange that she had saved his life, since at that moment he felt like all she wanted was to see him dead.
 ‚ÄúCome tomorrow with swords to spar,‚Äù she said at last, tucking a few strands of hair behind her ear.
 ‚ÄúYou can train me to wield my staff in melee combat.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see a staff,‚Äù Harruq said.
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see any swords either,‚Äù she shot back.

 Miles away, Harruq awoke screaming.
 Aurelia rushed to his side as he curled into a ball, shuddering frantically.
 ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead,‚Äù he said.
 Cold sweat covered his body.
 Remnants of his nightmare floated before his eyes, the icy voice of Velixar rolling over him in his vengeful fury.
 All he‚Äôd known, all he‚Äôd ever loved, was dead and gone.
 Only Karak had remained, furious at the loss.
 Through it all, one single fact pulsed as an undeniable truth.
 ‚ÄúVelixar,‚Äù Harruq said, clutching Aurelia‚Äôs hands and sighing with a mixture of relief and terror.

I cannot pass this chance up.
 I must see what will happen.‚Äù Rodregas nodded; they both knew they would not get this chance twice.
 Doi‚Äôvan saw in the Bunei what Rodregas had felt in the lion in the main hall.
 ‚ÄúSee any good Infernal sigils for me?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúI should bind my Infernal gift as well, especially as I will never be a great magician.‚Äù Rodregas had not really expected an answer, but Doi‚Äôvan surprised him by nodding his great head and pointing to the far back almost in a corner that strangely was the only one in shadow.
 ‚ÄúI think the Ni‚ÄôBarrbari, the daemon known as the Night Panther, would add a bit of subtly to your Celestial Lion.
 While hunters, they are also healers and not as vicious as most of the others.
 It might also cause less confusion if you are able to gain both Infernal and Celestial great sigils to have ones that share some similarities.‚Äù Rodregas nodded and walked toward where Doi‚Äôvan had pointed, having to circle around what appeared to be a bear with the front feet of a stork and the over large head of an owl.
 Rodregas felt his skin crawl and he almost left the chamber, but then the cat shape behind the daemon became clear.
 The Daemonic shape seemed to be missing the odd combinations of the others.

 ‚ÄúHalf fairy, half elf.‚Äù He sat in a chair as he started to answer and I kept moving past the bench where I intended to land and crawled onto his lap, curling my feet up, knees to my chest.
 His voice seemed mesmerizing as he continued, ‚ÄúHer mother was a fairy from the West.

After seeing how far behind I was already in Biology, it was nice to know we'd be working on something I'd already been through twice.
 On the other hand I hadn't liked the novel the first time I'd read it, and when I'd gritted my teeth and sat down for a second attempt I'd found I liked it even less.
 Maybe I just lacked the maturity to appreciate Bronte's so-called masterpiece, but I couldn't stand that her characters were almost all really nasty people.
 I wondered what else we'd be reading.
 I could always ask Britney, but the odds of her knowing anything useful seemed pretty slim.
 When the bell finally released us from an analysis of Heathcliff's early depravity, Britney asked what my next class was.
 She was elated to find we were both headed to Algebra.
 As we trailed the other students out of the class, I wasn't so sure I was equally enthused.
 Nobody had said anything to either of us.
 It was starting to look like Britney was receiving just as much of a cold shoulder as I was.

Rick was in the hall waiting for her.
 She blushed when she looked into his eyes.
 She'd spent the previous evening cuddled up to him, returning the gentle kisses he'd kept raining on her lips.
 Rick had kissed her more times last night than Davis had the entire time they'd been together, and she couldn't look at him without thinking of those kisses.
 Silently Rick took her hand and led her downstairs.
 In the garden, he took her face between his hands, kissing her softly.
 "If you get home, I'll miss you."
 "I'll miss you too," she whispered, hugging him.
 She made herself focus her mind on her parents as she wandered through the garden.
 She missed talking to her mother.

By the time I finally gave up and got out of bed I was not a happy camper.
 I was even less so by the time Mom finally woke up.
 Rachel not having been at Les Mis√©rables had been preying on my mind the whole time I'd been studying, and since Brandon wouldn't work for girl talk, I needed to hash it all out with my mom.
 Only she was so far gone, getting anything out of her was all but impossible.
 She interrupted partway through my description of what'd happened to ask if I'd noticed when the light outside my bedroom had stopped working.
 As if I cared when some stupid bulb burned out.
 I tried for another fifteen minutes, but once her mind started focusing on a new project, anything less than the domestic version of a tactical nuke had effectively zero chance of catching her attention.
 Apparently someone decided that having my mom completely ignore me in my moment of need was going a little too far on the divine retribution.
 In an effort to try and balance things out the dream angels granted me another vivid dream on Sunday night.

 He chuckled.

 He told her of the strength, weapons, and armor granted to him.
 Hesitantly, he recounted killing Ahrqur and the people of Cornrows, a fresh wave of shame filling him as he thought of both.
 ‚ÄúWhat part did Ahrqur play in this?‚Äù Aurelia asked.

"You'll see."
 That night he showed her how to use the treadmill and how to work the VCR.
 He rented an exercise video and the two movies he'd mentioned, and Marie found herself looking forward to the next day.
 She was up at the crack of dawn, and after she got dressed, she was tempted to go walk on the treadmill before she woke Rick.
 Walking but never moving was an interesting experience.
 But the fog might not last long, and she had to get back today.
 But this time she didn't go charging headlong through the garden.
 She'd gotten here by strolling through it thinking about Davis.
 She'd been thinking about the kiss that had hurt and horrified her.
 Would he be sorry he'd done that now that she was gone?

‚ÄúCan you feel it?‚Äù the man in black asked.
 ‚ÄúCan you feel your heart shudder and throb?

 Dieredon lay on his back, staring up at him.
 His chest was a mess of pain, his mind light and dizzy.
 As Velixar reached down, his maggoty face smiling and his hand dripping unholy magic, a wave of arrows rained upon him.
 Five buried into Velixar‚Äôs back.
 Six more found his legs and arms.
 He arched and shrieked as the blessed water seared his wretched body.

 Harruq folded the armor as best he could and clutched it to his chest.

Reaching inside to draw out the long white gown, I could not fathom Junnie‚Äôs reasoning.
 But she must have gone through much to get me this package.
 Numbly, I stared at her words while I unfastened my shirt and sash.
 The pouch I had rescued from the vault fell to the bed.
 How had I forgotten?
 I kicked off my shoes and pulled my top and pants off before sliding the gown over my head, straightening the length with my hands.
 The corset laced tight at my waist, the plunging neckline lower than anything I would ever wear.
 I retrieved the leather pouch from the bed to examine the contents, but before I loosened the binding I heard a crash behind me; three council guards had busted open my door.
 I tucked the pouch under the long bell sleeve of the dress as they crossed the room to seize me by the arms.

Brandon experienced the worst of the drug withdrawals in the first few days after his arrest.
 My wife, Lisa sat on the bathroom floor with him during his lowest moments.
 He vomited until he had nothing left.
 He curled up in the fetal position, chanting inaudible ramblings and contorting to the point that we had to pad the doorframe and cabinets with towels to keep him from banging his head and limbs.
 In the twelfth hour of fetal position rocking, infantile whimpering, sickening dry heaves and panicked breathing, I broke out my video camera, thinking I‚Äôd just tape a reminder: He can‚Äôt possibly ever want to do this again.

She was faster now, cracking the whip above me and at each side, moving again and again, closer and closer.
 I had to think of something but my mind could only concentrate on the snap of her whip.
 Her boots splashed in the melted snow again, and I sent the icy water racing up under the material of her skirt to her bare legs.
 Shock crossed her face and I hoped it would buy the time I needed.
 What now?
 The cold water had thrown her for no more than a fraction of a second, but it was enough time to right myself and execute one quick attack.
 I volleyed a nearby rock, which struck her in the back of the head and threw her balance off for another instant.
 I knew I was larger than her so I gritted my teeth and lunged, grabbing her as I tried to figure my next move.
 She raised her face and, when her eyes met mine, they narrowed.
 Part of me was aware I should have been scared, but I was enjoying myself.

Given everything she'd said, I'd anxiously waited for her to show up at the departure point.
 It'd seemed impossible, but as Mrs. Alexander had gently herded me onto the bus, there'd still been no sign of her.
 "Maybe she's driving instead of taking the bus down.
 I seem to remember someone saying her brother had purchased a ticket.
 He isn't here, so possibly they're going down together."
 It'd been a fairly slender thread upon which to hang my hopes.
 Somehow my dream of seeing Les Mis√©rables had morphed into a dream of seeing Les Mis√©rables with Rachel.
 We still didn't get to spend much time together, but she was rapidly becoming the only person I could confide in besides Brandon.
 A boyfriend, or near-boyfriend, was nice, but some things just needed to be shared with another female.
 I couldn't tell my mom about my feelings for Brandon or she'd absolutely freak.

I managed a smile.
 "Yeah, I'll be okay.
 It was just a really bad fight.
 I've never said those kinds of things to anyone.
 I don't think there's any going back.
 She has to hate me."
 Brandon shook his head and flashed another of his winning smiles, albeit one with an overtone of sympathy.
 "I'm sure it isn't as bad as that."
 I wanted to disagree, to go into detail about why my life had just taken a turn for the worse, but something about his manner was suddenly distant.
 I thought about calling him out on it, but with my life suddenly looking like I was all but friendless, that didn't seem like such a good idea.

Alec was more than capable of sending me away and then never letting me know he'd survived.
 There was a constant war inside him over what to do with me and I couldn't afford to give up my one advantage.
 He seemed less able to contemplate cutting me out of his life when I was around.
 I planned on playing that card for all it was worth.
 I was staying and that was it.
 Alec sighed, presumably in resignation, and then suddenly my legs were thrown up in front of me as he picked me up with inhuman speed.
 Only the steady pressure of Alec's arm around my waist kept me from screaming, and then I was back on my feet, and being carefully, but firmly shoved through a tangled knot of bodies.
 My shoes had never been intended to allow ankles to withstand that kind of punishment.
 Even just walking had been risky, so it wasn't a surprise when my right foot slipped, and a sharp knife of pain shot through that ankle as it collapsed under me.
 Dealing with blinding agony hadn't ever been my strong point.

The advantages of cooperation between republics needs to be care fully examined.
 A study should be conducted by a credible institution to estimate the economic losses incurred by the break-up of the common economic space between the former Soviet re publics and to assess the benefits of restoring an economic union in some form.
 It should estimate overall economic growth and living standards for each republic over the next five years operating within and outside the economic union.
 This study can serve as a powerful argument for closer cooperation among the republics.
 The study can be undertaken at very low cost by a consortium of researchers from different research institutes within the Commonwealth of Independent States.
 5.Privatize and develop road transport: Transportation is a major bottleneck to development of a market economy in much of the region.
 Under the centrally planned system, most freight was hauled by trains over main routes to large cities for distribution in bulk by huge government procurement agencies.
 Under a market system, millions of small producers and consumers must be free to buy or sell wherever the price is most attractive.
 This requires a vast proliferation of small goods transporters in the private sector, which are rare in many countries today.
 The large freight transport monopolies have to be replaced by entrepreneurial companies with small fleets competing for freight business.

 "You were serious about being fed!"
 "You'd better believe it."
 She fed him a forkful of fried rice.
 He returned the favor, and within ten minutes the table was covered with grains of rice and bits of food they'd spilled.
 "Let me have some of that sweet and sour chicken," Rick said.
 He shook his head when she speared a piece.

On the other hand, if the forces of the guild came after him‚Ä¶ The guardsmen of the Immortalist guild were known as the Immortal Guards and their reputation as the premier fighters of the realm was seldom questioned.
 If they found out what had happened at Raven Keep there was not much chance for Rodregas‚Äô survival.
 After a simple meal, a good rub down for the horses and a few hours of rest, Rodregas got the wagon back on the road.
 If he could keep up this pace, up he could be well hidden before any forces could find him.
 At the end of the second day, before he had come to his last turn off, he realized that he would have to get some sleep.
 He was feeling exhausted.
 His body might be surprisingly strong and quick but apparently it still needed to sleep on a regular basis.
 As soon as the horses were fed, rubbed down, hobbled and left to graze, Rodregas unrolled Captain Poir‚Äôs mattress and collapsed into it with a welcome sigh.
 Sleep came to him almost instantly.
 In Rodregas‚Äô life he had experienced several very unpleasant ways of waking up, but this was the worst: a searing hot pain stabbed into his stomach!

She was a virgin and planned to be one until her wedding night.
 How could he take that from her?
 How could he use an act of love to manipulate her into staying with him?
 And if she decided to go home anyway, how could he let her go home with the shame he knew she'd feel?
 He couldn't do it.
 No matter how much he loved her, no matter how much he wanted to make love to her and keep her with him, he couldn't do that to her.
 By the time Marie had washed her face and redone her make-up and brushed her hair, the hiccups were gone.

She had no intention of breaking up with her boyfriend.
 I looked her square in her beautiful blue eyes and I told her flatly, ‚ÄúYou are going to fall so in love with me that you will not even remember this guy‚Äôs name!‚Äù We were married three years later.
 After all the years we have been married, I still think of that moment I saw her walk into that bar whenever we are having a tough time.
 It puts all my love right back where it belongs and nothing else matters.

I hurried from the room, explaining to Ruby I would be getting ready for the trip.
 ‚ÄúI already put your pack in the front room for Chevelle.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just check it,‚Äù I said.
 ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù I found the pack with some of Chevelle‚Äôs things.
 As I started to open it, I knocked one of his bags over and went to pick it up.
 The flap was loose and a piece of familiar fabric hung out.
 I glanced over my shoulder to be sure Ruby wasn‚Äôt watching, and opened the bag to find the fabric-wrapped package she‚Äôd handed to Chevelle our first day here.
 The package he‚Äôd traded my stone for.
 I pulled the material back to reveal a leather-bound book.
 Afraid Ruby would catch me, I slid the book into my own pack and took it to my room.
 I‚Äôd already been in trouble for stealing one book but this was technically mine.

It was a relief when Mrs. Campbell finally capped her marker and turned us loose to work on the homework assignment.
 I was midway through the first assignment when one of the aides slipped into the room and whispered into Mrs. Campbell's ear.
 There was a kind of muted, collective gasp that made me look up just in time to see the color drain out of her face.
 Before the aide had even finished whispering, Mrs. Campbell was out of her chair and headed towards the door.
 Thirty seconds later we were all still looking around and wondering what had happened.
 It was a testament to our respect for, or in some cases fear of, Mrs. Campbell that nobody spoke in anything above a whisper for an entire five minutes.
 Every terrible thing that could possibly happen to a person flowed through my mind, and all I could do was hope I was overreacting.
 Mrs. Campbell had scared me a little that first day, but she'd been pretty nice since, and she'd always been fair.

This has opened the door for self-reliant growth in many developing countries.
 This growth could have been considerably more impressive but for constraints placed on it by both tariff and, particularly, non-tariff barriers.
 The latter have proliferated in recent decades and affected almost half of OECD imports during the 1980s.
 By the end of 1990, there were more than 200 export-constraint arrangements involving product groups of impor tance to developing countries.
 The incidence of anti-dumping cases against developing countries rose substantially in the late 1980s.
 The more recent effort by the industrial nations to impose 'fair labour standards' on exports from developing countries could well become another form of constraint, unless carefully formulated to focus on the basic rights of workers, rather than on arbitrary minimum wage levels.
 Efforts to accelerate the dismantling of both trade and non-trade barriers should be viewed as a central element of a global strategy to stimulate employment generation.
 6.Debt repayments: The debt problem is a major obstacle to the development and welfare of at least 60 heavily indebted, developing countries, including two-thirds of the world's poorest nations.
 Most of these countries suffered a decline in per capita income over the past decade and are now in arrears with more than 20 per cent of their debt obligations.
 The debt burden discourages new foreign investment and lending to these coun tries and prevents them from stimulating economic growth through additional domestic savings and investment.

She stared at him in dismay.
 "That's the surprise?"
 He laughed.
 "No.
 I have to work late because of the surprise.
 I have quite a bit of vacation time coming, and I thought I'd take some next week.
 Since I'm not giving much notice, I have a lot of things I have to take care of tomorrow."
 If a vacation was the surprise, it must include her, but she didn't want to make any assumptions.

This was the same radio from which I would later hear about deaths: Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Martin Luther King.
 Shit, I still have that little radio‚ÄîI kept it because it seemed important.
 (laughs) It was my mother‚Äôs kitchen radio‚Äîit‚Äôs still around here somewhere.
 And, on this particular morning of oatmeal and familial familiarities, a song emanated from that plastic box, bellowing something about a ‚Äúblack branch with blood that kept dripping.‚Äù You know?
 And, ‚Äúa white ladder all covered with water.‚Äù  I thought, holy hell.
 Of course, by this time, I was making my own music, fixing to go out on my own, and, in a way, I saw Dylan as a map, as a way out into the world.
 What more can we ask of art, right?
 Later, when I met him, I talked to him about this and he was, well, flattered, I guess, and he talked about how Guthrie and Leadbelly were like that for him.
 All these memories collide in my head to form a capharnaum around what I want to know more concretely: how did Bob Dylan become important to me?
 And the process must have been gradual, an accretion, Bob Dylan never became, for me, what James Joyce was for Richard Ellmann, or to use a less pretentious comparison, what hamburgers were for Wimpy.

"Adri, do you have a sec?"
 The deadly nickname.
 Apparently I'd only thought I was doing better.
 The good feeling I'd gotten from helping Jackie had just been the deceptive crust of ice hiding the sub-zero deathtrap below.
 My desk was too far away.
 I wanted to try and gut it out, but the emotional extremes from the day had been too draining.
 I slumped into the empty chair next to Rachel and tried to concentrate on my breathing.
 Maybe I could lessen its impact, somehow have a mini-attack that made my mind blank out, but left me enough control over my body to remain seated in the chair.

Seeing all of my classmates looking utterly bored as they allowed themselves to be herded through the most amazing building I'd ever seen brought me back to my original train of thought.
 I hadn't actually spent every waking moment thinking about Les Mis√©rables.
 A fair number of those seconds had been spent with Brandon.
 He'd already been picking me up from school every morning and dropping me off most days.
 We now spent every lunch together, and he'd started lingering when he dropped me off.
 It was still only on the days when Mom wasn't home, and I hadn't quite mustered the guts to invite him in, but it'd still been really nice.
 Of course it'd been the logical kind of thing to have start happening after someone asked you to the Ashure Day Dance.
 It was still so amazing someone like Brandon had asked me to go to a dance that half the time I forgot all about it.
 The other half of the time I had a hard time believing it'd really happened.
 But it had, and there were more than four dozen roses scattered around our kitchen to prove it.

There is a similar trend for other staple crops and meat.
 For fish, there has actually been a net decline of seven per cent in per capita world production.
 To a large extent, this slowdown is the result of slower growth in demand, especially in industrial countries, under lining the fact that food security is predominantly an economic problem rather than a technological one.
 But the decline in the growth of global agricultural productivity over the past decade is also attributable to a variety of political, economic and environmental factors.
 Political priority
 After the Second World War, developing countries that had suffered from recurring famine in early periods struggled to increase food production as an urgent national priority to keep up with surging population growth and spiralling demand for food.
 India‚Äôs Green Revolution was spurred by the imminent threat of severe famine in the mid-1960s.
 China was compelled to produce more food by the loss of perhaps as many as 30 or 40 million lives to famine in the late 1950s.
 But the very motive which stimulated these achievements moderated them as well.
 For while these governments took concerted steps to meet the minimum needs of the population for food, they tended to overlook the equally great potential to utilize agriculture as an engine for economic growth and job creation.

Cessation of violence and conflict settlement often leave unresolved the root causes of conflict, resulting in potential for renewed fighting or social turbulence.
 Peace-building activities should address underlying economic and social factors that prevent the establishment of a stable and secure peace.
 In instances such as Cambodia, Rwanda and Somalia, the vacuum created by the complete collapse of political and economic institutions necessitates a broader role for the UN in re-establishing the peace.
 Peace building has thus far been defined as post-conflict actions to support reconstruction and to strengthen and solidify peace.
 The concept needs to be broadened to include pre-conflict actions and expanded to encompass a wider array of potentially destabilizing factors that lead to conflicts.
 The Commission supports the establishment of an International Centre jointly operated by the UN Security Council and UNESCO to implement peace-building programmes.
 Peace-building activities should be expanded to address security threats issuing from environmental degradation, poverty, migration of population and refugees.
 Many cases of ethnic conflict have an under lying basis of economic deprivation that must be addressed before tensions will permanently subside.
 Others can be mitigated by the introduction of positive economic incentives for cooperation.
 Economic cooperation is already dissipating ethnic tensions and conflict in the Middle East.

We made the long drive to attend the graduation ceremony with our younger son, Bryce, my mother, my in-laws‚Äîwho were no longer in the dark‚Äî and my brothers.
 It was a gathering including all the students and the staff.
 Prior to the ceremony we were invited to eat dinner with everyone.
 We walked the food line with all who attended, a variety of foods were spooned into our plates and I felt like I was it was chow time in the mess hall.
 We were seated close to the front in a crowded cafeteria room.
 The room was a scattering of mismatched tables and chairs and old couches that were obviously a collection of donations.
 It started with accolades and awards for those early in their treatment and worked its way through the students by their personal achievements inching towards the finale of the three students set to ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù tonight.
 Everyone who was recognized for reaching a new level of their treatment was welcome to speak if they wished.
 Those who were in the program longer were more likely to do so, thanking others (both students and staff) for helping them through their most difficult challenges.
 Some were very emotional and some were humorous, all were heartfelt and meaningful descriptions of their individual challenges to reach that next level.

 Taiga wore the form of a High Elf male that was slim and graceful, as was most of its kind.
 His hair and eyes were a striking pale violet color, and his skin was a light nut color which made a strong contrast with his hair.
 This was highlighted by the similarly colored silk toga he wore.
 He wore no rings or accessories, his outfit simple, but extravagant.
 Van‚Äôdret suddenly wished he had thought to dress simpler for the occasion his green and emerald outfit with its gold trim seemed garish in comparison; and his human male form that normally seemed attractive and robust seemed ungainly and drab in comparison.
 Taiga‚Äôs manner continued to be friendly but inquisitive.
 The conversation started with a polite discussion on new spells that Van‚Äôdret was working on, and then moved to his thoughts on the recent political and economic tensions with the Romig Empire.

It took everything I had just to hold myself together until class ended.
 I'd planned on remaining in my seat until everyone else left, but Mrs. Tiggs motioned me to her desk while half the class was still filing out the door.
 "It gives me no pleasure to tell you this, but based on your initial test score I think you should prepare yourself for the fact that you're probably going to fail this class.
 I worried this would be the result of your starting so late in the semester and not having any prior Spanish experience.
 Unfortunately, it's now too late for you to switch into another class.
 I'm afraid you'll just have to take the failing grade."
 I stood there woodenly for several seconds, unsure whether or not she was through.

Our path became more defined, pushing us through trees and between rocks, trailing upward so minutely I didn‚Äôt even realize until I glanced back and saw the base of the mountains beneath us.
 I appraised the narrow path ahead, snaking high through a vast rock-strewn mountain, and turning back didn‚Äôt seem so bad after all.
 Fists clenched, I pushed out the question I‚Äôd been most concerned about asking.

Feeling like a traitor, I headed my skittering thoughts off before they could start affecting me physically, and focused on the next step in getting ready.
 There was a lot more at stake this morning than last night.
 If I fell apart now I might not make it to school, and then I'd have all kinds of trouble calming Mom back down when she returned from wherever she'd gone.
 My hair hung as limp and straight as always.
 No amount of styling ever made it look any better, just more contrived.
 Makeup was the same way.
 A touch here or there made me look marginally better, but I sincerely envied the girls who were skilled enough to transform their faces into something breathtaking after a session in the bathroom.
 Mom wasn't any help.
 Most days she didn't even put on mascara.
 With the most depressing part of my routine now done, my mind wandered forward.

Jasmin and Dominic crowded up against me, one on either side, and I let my hands brush against their heads.
 The feel of their fur, one short and soft, the other long and coarse, anchored me before the surreal strangeness of the scene could carry me away.
 The tingle of shape shifter power was as strong as I'd ever felt it, jumping from multiple sources, arcing around me as it unsuccessfully looked for a place to ground out.
 For the first time, I was able to accurately pick out the individual signatures that made it up.
 Jess was off to the left, white hot with mixed anger and fear, stabilized only by the cool, controlled pillar of power that was Isaac.
 Jasmin almost hummed under my fingertips like barely-leashed violence, while my other hand drank from the still pond that was Dominic, her mere presence feeding me comfort.
 I'd just finished identifying the raging beast to the right as James, when Brandon stepped into the light.
 He looked like some kind of pagan god, smeared all over with blood, an uneven circle drawn on his chest, filled with sharp, angry lines that didn't mean anything to me, but which made the wolves around me tense and growl.
 "While I appreciate the sentiment, it really is far too late to secure absolution by bringing me the girl."
 His voice had changed, becoming deeper and harsher, with elements that didn't sound like they could come from any human throat.

One product of these studies could be the development of specific job coefficients measuring the impact of growth in trade in different industries on overall employment.
 Trade becomes of even greater potential benefit to industrial nations during the coming decade when economic growth in these countries is expected to be significantly slower than in the developing world.
 The pent-up demand generated by the destruction of Europe during the Second World War, the rapid expansion of population during the baby boom generation, and the explosion of new technologies in the past few decades, all generated strong internal demand in the OECD countries, resulting in steady economic growth.
 The slow growth of population and productivity in more recent years means that these factors cannot be expected to drive further economic expansion at the same rate.
 In contrast, average growth rates in developing countries are expected to be two to three times higher than in the industrial nations.
 The increase in the dollar output of developing countries was actually bigger than that of the most economically advanced nations in 1992 and 1993, and this trend is expected to continue.
 Measured in terms of purchasing power parity, developing countries now represent more than one-third of the world economy.
 More than 40 per cent of US exports now go to developing countries and two-thirds of the increase in US exports in recent years has gone to these nations.
 The rising expectations and upward mobility of millions of people in developing countries represent a vast potential source of demand, higher incomes and jobs for the West.
 Increasing incomes among the poorest countries has the greatest multiplier effect on global aggregate demand, because even small increments in per capita income can lead to large increases in the number of households with incomes above the threshold for buying consumer goods.

Its report presented evidence to dispel the twin myths that technological development and trade were net job destroyers.
 It traced the growth of employment opportunities through the 20th Century, a century of unprecedented technological development and commercial expansion, to show that this period has also been an era of unprecedented growth in the quantity and quality of employment opportunities.
 The report argued that the current surge in joblessness was a temporary result of the mismatch between the rates of surging population growth and expanding economic activity.
 It concurred that rising levels of unemployment constituted a serious problem that needed to be urgently addressed, but rejected the notion that it is an inevitable and incurable disease which the world must resign itself to passively suffer and endure.
 The Commission, therefore, developed and presented a comprehensive strategy for job-led economic growth.
 Over the past decade, changes in the employment picture lend credence to ICPF‚Äôs perspective.
 The American economy experienced a decade-long expansion, fuelling high levels of employment at home, while stimulating job growth throughout East Asia, attracting a massive influx of foreign technical workers and setting the stage for a global outsourcing boom which is still in its infancy.
 Among the advanced economies, unemployment declined from an average of 6.9 per cent in the period 1985-94 to 6.5 per cent during the last 10 years.
 It fell by 10 per cent in France, 25 per cent in Italy, a third in Netherlands, 50 per cent in Spain and 70 per cent in Ireland.
 It is declining but remains 10 per cent higher than the average for 1985-94 in Germany, which is still recovering from the economic impact of reunification.

But neither America‚Äôs culture nor its historical economic and political development and present outlook will permit it to take on the extraordinary responsibilities and overseas commitments which fulfilment of this role necessitates, as its reluctance to get involved in Bosnia and Rwanda, and its quick withdrawal from Somalia illustrate.
 Indeed, no one nation can or should assume such responsibilities on behalf of the whole world.
 The rapid shift of Eastern European and former Soviet republics to radically different political and economic systems demonstrates that changes of even greater magnitude than this can be brought about rapidly.
 There is likely to be far greater support for this change than may at first appear possible.
 Russia may actively support and China offer only nominal resistance, once a clear conception of the new structure has emerged.
 Ironically, the major opposition to this change is most likely to come from the past defenders of democratic principles in the Western world, rather than from the newly liberated nations of Eastern Europe.
 If so, this will follow the normal law of social development in which the vanguards of previous revolutions become the principal opponents of the next stage of progress.
 Even here it is likely to come primarily from entrenched vested interests, not the general public.
 A mere tinkering with or modest amendment to the structure of the UN will only perpetuate the inherent inadequacies of the present system and postpone its maturation into a truly effective instrument for global political, economic and social integration and collective accomplishment.
 Many proposals are being floated to modify its workings, mostly by expanding representation on the Security Council.

The absence of peace in war-torn Africa or democratic freedoms in former colonial nations, the absence of social stability or an entrepreneurial class, the absence of a functioning banking or educational system, the absence of the minimum necessary infrastructure for transportation and communication ‚Äì any one of these may be enough to prevent transition until the deficit is made up.
 If even an inessential element or condition is missing, the process of transition may take much longer than would otherwise be necessary.
 Lack of information, lack of education, lack of necessary skills, lack of supportive laws or incentives or protection against losses ‚Äì insufficiency in any of these areas may be enough to slow or delay the process of change by years or even decades.
 The world needs a coherent intellectual framework for understanding and dealing with radical transitions.
 High priority should be given to developing a fresh conceptual approach that is not en cumbered by allegiance to existing theories and systems.
 Transitions should be regarded as social transformations which depend on and result in corresponding changes in the political, economic and other spheres.
 Efforts to guide a multi-dimensional social transition through uni-dimensional strategies, particularly those limited to manipulation of macro-economic policy, are unlikely to yield the anticipated results.
 Even those transitions which are apparently confined to economic activities within a stable political context necessarily depend on changes in social attitudes and in social institutions which can be dealt with most effectively by assuming a wider perspective of the process.
 Clear visualization of the before and after states of transition, the existing system, the goals to be sought after, and a detailed picture of the changes that need to occur in behaviour, attitudes and institutions are necessary for deriving the most effective transition strategies.
 With the knowledge the world possesses today, with the example of many successful nations over the last four decades, and with its highly educated and motivated people, surely the nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia can abridge the time required and the hardship of lessons learned by trial and error to a few years.

 But I did not think it was real.
 It is a concept of what we are as a people.

 Rodregas caught her arm, holding her back.
 He was not sure what to say but Doi‚Äôvan was.

Her sword was at his throat before he could do anything and the officiating knight yelled a stop to the match, handing the yellow band to Karun and the white second place finish to Rodregas.
 Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda met him at the entrance to the cafeteria, Rodregas stalked in without looking at them and stood quietly in line to get his large bowl of stew and chunk of bread.
 They sat down away from where most of the other squires.
 The other two sat quietly until all three had finished the repast.
 ‚ÄúSo how did Geriodon and Nordien finish?‚Äù asked Rodregas.
 Doi‚Äôvan spoke, ‚ÄúGeriodon finished first place which puts him in the total lead with a perfect fifteen points.
 Nordien only got a third place red ribbon so he has only eleven, Karun is now second with thirteen points.‚Äù Rodregas nodded.
 With only nine points he was unlikely to be able to compete in the final championship melee.
 ‚ÄúImeralda, can you do me a favor?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúOf course, but I am not sure how I can help,‚Äù she said.

He watched the book and, occasionally, when his gaze was on my face, it wandered back up and out of focus, just above me.
 But he did not look directly into my eyes as before.
 It bothered me, and I didn‚Äôt think it was because of my conscience.
 When he reached the end of the book, it returned to its home on the shelf and he stood, placing a hand briefly on the top of my head.
 It was only a momentary touch, but electricity surged though me.
 A flash of confusion or frustration passed over his features, too fast to identify.
 He looked into my eyes one last time as I sat, stunned and speechless, my skin still tingling from the contact.
 ‚ÄúEnough for today,‚Äù he said, nodding as he turned, his long strides taking him too quick from my view.
 I sat motionless as I watched him go, and remained so for some time after.

Contrary to his early good mood, the Nymph froze at those words.
 With a hesitant smile the green haired Nymph said, ‚ÄúWe actually prefer the term Nymph of Life.
 Truly, life is as powerful an element as any.‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù Rodregas said, realizing he had accidentally insulted the healer, ‚ÄúI have never spent much time with Nymphs.‚Äù Rodregas‚Äô tone was quieter.
 The Nymph seemed young and smart and gifted.
 Rodregas knew he did not have to like him.
 But clearly from Imeralda‚Äôs introduction, this Nymph was well known and powerful among his people, and he had saved both Rodregas‚Äô and Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs lives.
 There was an awkward moment until Doi‚Äôvan appeared at the door.
 He walked with the help of a tall walking stick.
 His arm and side were both covered in bandages.
 Durien followed him in with a heavy stool, which Doi‚Äôvan quickly sat down on.

The last few years the only time I was in a place rich in magic, I was also a prisoner.
 It is good not to hunger for magic and be FREE!‚Äù Rodregas was, of course, curious about the Hellborn‚Äôs background but had been hesitant to ask.
 You do not want to piss off one of the Hellborn.
 Hellborn were not necessarily chaotic and sadistic beings, like actual daemons or Greater Daemons, at least unless they voluntarily chose to become one of Hell‚Äôs Chosen.
 Rodregas did not think even one of the Immortalists would choose to mess with one of Hell‚Äôs Chosen.
 Hellborn on the mortal world were welcome among the Orqui much like those of Celestial blood were among the humans and the AElves.
 The Orqui mated with Daemons and their offspring became its races noble house, just as the blood of Celestials flowed in the noble houses of Humans and AElves.
 Of course, here in the Eastern Realms true ruler ship was not by the demi-gods of the noble houses anymore but by the Immortalists and their Guild of the Celestial Path.
 Often those of Celestial blood, instead of being rulers, were prey to the Guild for their rituals.
 Rodregas decided it was now or never if he was going to ask Doi‚Äôvan of his past.

But at what price?
 I wasn‚Äôt as worried about the financial price at this point, but rather the thought of owing Thomas after all that he had perpetrated against us was almost as unpalatable as Brandon‚Äôs Oxy addiction.
 This was all unchartered territory.
 It was all uncomfortable.
 It all sucked big time.
 My pride would take a back seat to Brandon‚Äôs needs.
 His drug problem was more important than the grudge I was holding over my brother‚Äôs drug-induced antics.

 His mouth covered hers, his kiss slow and hot and thorough.

Of course, leaving a little magic left over would be great if I can, but you never really know until after the searing.‚Äù Rodregas paused and then added, ‚ÄúThe problem is that only two groups in the Eastern Realms have the knowledge to do the searing.
 The first, of course, is the Guild of the Celestial Path.
 I think we all agree they are not sharing it with me soon,‚Äù Rodregas continued with a smile.
 ‚ÄúAnd the second is the Knightly Order of the Soaring Heavens, who are reported to have the greatest collection, and they only let their knights be seared.
 I don‚Äôt think they are going to be sharing anytime soon either.‚Äù Imeralda looked at Rodregas.
 She knew that the Order of the Soaring Heavens was the order that Rodregas had belonged to as a squire, but his taking on of another‚Äôs body was anathema to the teaching of the order.
 Rodregas was an Immortalist in fact, if not a member of the Guild, and he was pretty sure most of the knights would kill him if they found out his story.

 The Celestial Gods pick their Paladins from their membership.
 Sigil Warriors - Those who are born with magical talent but do not wish to be sorcerers have the opportunity inscribe a sigil on their magic talent that uses up a portion of their magical ability.
 Lesser sigils are simple such as health, strength, quickness.
 Greater Sigils are more complex and can mimic the powers of Celestial Beast or Infernal Daemons.

Between 1960 and 1992, total employment in OECD countries rose by 110 million jobs or 44 per cent, including a 22 per cent increase in the participation of women in the workforce.
 During this same period, un employment rose by 23 million persons, representing a 259 per cent increase in the overall unemployment rate.
 More people are working than ever before, yet at the same time more people are unemployed, because a larger proportion of the population seek jobs.
 Growing anxiety about employment prospects in the West were aggravated by a sudden 50 per cent increase in unemployment after 1990, which displaced an additional 10 million workers in the OECD and was equalled only by the previous high of 1983.
 This increase is now showing signs of reversal.
 These average figures disguise significant differences in performance of countries within the OECD.
 Since 1950, Japan‚Äôs employment rate has risen from 43 per cent to around 50 per cent, while unemployment has remained in the 1 to 3 per cent range.
 The overall proportion of the population employed in the European Community has declined by 1 per cent since 1965 and is presently just under 41 per cent, but the percentage of the working age population employed has remained more or less constant over the past three decades, at 67 per cent, whereas in other OECD regions it has risen significantly ‚Äì to exceed 75 per cent in North America, Scandinavia and Japan.
 Europe‚Äôs lower labour participation rate is attributable to a number of factors.
 A far higher percentage of the European workforce was engaged in agriculture 25 years ago and has since shifted to non-agricultural sectors, an adjustment that occurred in the United States during earlier decades.

Several homes, those with their doors smashed open, had gore smeared on their floors.
 One pained Dieredon‚Äôs heart greatly; amid a great red circle on a wooden floor laid a small, bloodstained doll.
 He said a silent prayer before moving on.
 At the edge of the town, he found many frantic tracks fleeing west.
 He followed them, wincing as some ended in dried smears of red upon the grass.
 Others led far past the others.
 They ended at once in an enormous pool of blood, leaving the town a somber image in the distance.
 Chasing them the whole while were twin sets of tracks, one of enormous weight, the other light as a feather.

Soren Kierkegaard calls Abraham the Knight of Faith, a fellow so sure of God that even the idea of questioning a command to murder his own son was unthinkable.
 Good for him.
 Honest.
 Luke the horse breeder, I can admire, and Eric I can adore, in part because I know their flaws, their humanity.
 Luke's are exposed in "A Father's Story".
 Eric's I can remember, and for reminders, I have his report cards.
 Adoring a human may require us to have developed beyond pure selfishness.
 Yet once that's accomplished, the task seems to come naturally.
 But, at my level, even attempting to adore God is calling for plenty of effort.

He wanted to whisper to her as he removed it, and give her a hint of the desperate gambit that he was about to try, but he knew that it was not worth the risk of others overhearing.
 Both of their lives depended on her doing what Rodregas had told her.
 If he succeeded, she would know what Rodregas had done; if he failed, well he was familiar enough with that feeling.
 He saw her lips forming something under her breath, probably a spell, but she did not have time to execute a spell of sufficient strength in the time left her.
 Magic took too long to prepare to be useful so quickly.
 Ravenhurr stepped into the last circle; the one made entirely of what appeared to be fresh blood and of symbols made from the careful placement of living organs.
 Rodregas breathed in deeply, trying to settle himself, and almost gagged from the smells: the stench of fresh blood, the scent of fear from the prisoners, the smell of power, and other smells that he could not identify.
 Rodregas closed down on himself, ‚ÄúDuty,‚Äù he thought.

 With a sharp tearing sound, Alec's right hand elongated into the viciously clawed weapon of his hybrid form.
 It shredded the comforter and mattress just a few inches from my head.
 I gave him my best lop-sided smile and kissed his arm.
 "You're not going to scare me off with cheap tricks.

 His eyes were an intense blue, paler than normal.
 They were Alec's eyes, but they were also the eyes of his beast, and I suddenly realized the dominance stuff wasn't just a game.
 There was a feral part of Alec that didn't play well with others, that would kill or be killed in turn rather than have his will thwarted.

I wanted to get numb.
 For about the tenth time, Karen Flagstad had rejected me, even though a few days before I had warned her that if she wouldn‚Äôt join me at a movie that weekend, I would fast until death.
 From breakfast Monday until late Wednesday afternoon, all I had ingested were three beers and a Coke.
 Then I gobbled two jumbo hamburgers and spent the night consuming aspirins, with my head on two pillows because one alone felt hard as pavement.
 The next day, after Spanish class on Friday, I recounted my ordeal to Karen and explained that all my suffering certainly must have earned me her company at the movies.
 She congenially disagreed.
 While Eric and I drank bourbon and ginger ale, I griped about Karen.
 At first I acted tough and unruffled, but soon the bourbon took hold, and I confessed the pain in my gut that had nothing to do with fasting.
 He asked why I got so obsessed about Karen, knowing I never had pursued anybody else so boldly.

"She left about five minutes before James did."
 "Still chatting up her prime candidate for the big dance?"
 Rachel nodded as we skirted the last two tables between us and the one exterior door in the tutor lab.
 "Yep, she's definitely settled on Tim Parsons, who's perfect if you like your men fairly handsome, moderately popular, and built like an ox."
 I wanted to protest, but if anything Rachel was being too kind.
 I'd seen Tim trying to sound out the captions underneath the pictures in Sports Illustrated of his favorite pro football players.
 I was just about to ask who we were going to ride with, more as a way of changing the subject than anything else, when movement off to my right answered the question.
 "Alec!"
 The last thing I was expecting out of Rachel was for her to all but run towards Alec with her arms out as if expecting a hug.
 Even so, that was less surprising than the fact that Alec accepted the hug, turning slightly to the side to receive her, but still reaching out with his left arm to pull her in close, albeit only briefly.

Like the farmhouse, the barn was also built of the same impressive large cut stone.
 However, while the stone was in great shape, all other materials seemed to have fallen apart.
 There were several small trees and bushes growing in the barn.
 The floor was also stone, and there was not enough dirt and debris for them to grow very large.
 They had to clear a path to get the wagon in.
 Imeralda ran her hand over the stone with a surprisingly gentle caress.
 ‚ÄúIt is Nymph stone, right?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 She nodded and said, ‚ÄúYes, I am half Forest Nymph and half AElf and this is beautiful work.‚Äù All Nymphs have a specific attachment to nature such as forest, stone or water.
 There was a lot of variation among the Nymphs, but they could do amazing things with their element.
 A connection to stone is much sought after by mages.

And when dad said goodbye to us, he put a hand tentatively on my shoulder, before letting me go.
 It was the most he ever touched me, you know, that generation, those dads, not the down-on-the-carpet kind of parents.
 But that crappy paint store.
 Man.
 It was killing him, boring him silly.
 But, he came home every night with a grin on his face.
 Ate dinner with us, spot on 4:45, like you could set your fucking watch by it, and then, evenings when he played, he‚Äôd sheepishly pick up his little case, which usually sat in the back closet next to his shoe tree, and he would toss off a sad smile and go play till God knows what hour.
 And Mom would sit and stew.

"It was all just a game for you, wasn't it?"
 There was anger behind the voice now, subtle, like the scent of rain the night before a storm, but definitely there.
 I started to bristle; I even took a breath to explain what'd really happened.
 Only the truth wasn't any better than the story he'd fabricated.
 It was worse even.
 I'd much rather this cocky, spoiled, rich boy be mad at me than feel pity.
 I'd had enough pity from my mom to last years.
 "You bet.
 Think they bought it?"
 I tried to inject the proper amount of blonde stupidity into my words, but wasn't sure it worked until I felt Alec's arms tighten almost painfully around me.

I wasn‚Äôt sure how long they‚Äôd be gone; I went to one of the narrow windows on the front wall and peered cautiously out.
 They were nowhere to be seen, but the sights of the village distracted me quickly enough.
 It was so unlike home.
 Night gave the gray stones an even darker appearance, the firelight glinting off their ragged edges like polished onyx.
 Torches lit each walkway and building.
 It seemed late, but several villagers were still outside, loud and boisterous.
 Nearly everyone dressed in black, a few of the men bearing large silver breastplates or wrist cuffs.
 Most wore leather, laced tight against thick, muscled frames.
 Few were thin or as petite as the elves I was used to seeing.
 These were strong, like Chevelle and Steed.

I'd never seen someone with so little extra flesh on their bones, at least not outside a hospital.
 It seemed she should be wearing a hospital gown instead of the white, flower-print summer dress I was almost sure cost more than my whole wardrobe.

7.Plan for institutional development: An assessment of the type and functioning of existing institutions and economic systems should be compiled to identify missing links that need to be provided to support the transition.
 Based on this study, a master plan should be drawn up for establishing the necessary institutions and systems in each country.
 In order to prepare a cadre of managers for private sector industry and institutions, specialized institutes of management should be set up in each country.
 8.Launch a massive programme to impart new skills and attitudes to the population: In countries where private enterprise was extinguished for decades, entrepreneurial, financial and marketing skills can be extremely limited.
 An analysis should be undertaken of the types and levels of skills needed for transition to a market system, covering areas such as entrepreneurship, management, national and international marketing, strategic business planning, finance, quality control, product development, production technology, design, and human resource development.
 Experience in former colonial nations where entrepreneur ship was also stifled for a long period indicates that a profound change in attitude is necessary before people will risk leaving or forego seeking salaried and pensioned jobs in favour of self-employment, even when the salaried jobs are scarce or unavailable.
 Such a basic change of attitude, which normally requires a change of generation, can be accelerated by a massive programme of public information, education and demonstration spanning several years.
 9.Study the benefits of economic recovery on world trade: Recessionary trends are affecting many parts of the world today.
 The prognosis in the West, especially in the European Union, is for slow growth during the 1990s.
 The progress of developing countries is impeded by slow growth in the industrialized nations and the collapse of Eastern Europe.

At first Harruq did not see who he saluted, but an elf fell from the roof and landed before the soldier.
 ‚ÄúAn elf,‚Äù Harruq whispered, managing to grab Qurrah‚Äôs attention.
 Now both peered around the corner, curious why such an exotic creature had arrived mere seconds before war.
 ‚ÄúGreetings, Dieredon,‚Äù the soldier hailed, pulling off his helmet.
 He was a middle-aged, blond-haired man who had numerous scars on his face.
 ‚ÄúGreetings to you as well, guard captain Antonil,‚Äù Dieredon said, taking a step back and kneeling.
 ‚ÄúThough I fear greetings is all I may offer you.‚Äù
 Antonil pointed to the wall, and he asked something which neither could hear when the orc army shouted another communal roar.

‚ÄúSo Jason, we have a question for you.‚Äù I nodded towards Emily.

 She had triggered it all.
 Jason had been hiding two blue, full, water pistols behind his back and was now shooting them at Emily‚Äôs face.
 She was holding up her hands and letting out some sort of squeal.
 Seth had been hiding a full two-handed water gun behind his back and the end was pointed at no other than me.
 ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt,‚Äù I said, my voice dark.
 Seth gave me a maniac‚Äôs grin, ‚ÄúYou already know the answer to that.‚Äù Then he shot me right in the face.

Bound in iron, they looked like they could handle a battering ram better than even the front gates.
 A group of knights stood tall next to the doors, but their heads tracked the presence of Rodregas and his two companions.
 Rodregas vaguely remembered one as Gorin, an older man who under more prosperous times for the knighthood would now be enjoying his retirement.
 ‚ÄúGorin!‚Äù Rodregas yelled boastfully, ‚ÄúOpen the doors, the Grand Marshal says that I may review the choice I must make.‚Äù Rodregas walked over and slapped the knight in the arm, laying it on heavy.
 Luckily, his success on the field had him in a good mood.
 Rodregas waved at the heavy doors as if wiggling his fingers could open them.
 ‚ÄúSir Rodregas, you look good for having just completed the tournament this day,‚Äù said Gorin.
 ‚ÄúI would not expect you to be moving around much yet.‚Äù Rodregas nodded.
 He could not explain that he already had a minor sigil of healing.

Had I seen something like that before?
 Hiking maybe?
 Only I could count the number of hikes I'd actually participated in on one hand.
 Surely something like that would've stayed with me.
 Someone gasped as the crowd shifted around, distracting me from my half-formed suspicions.
 I looked over at the exterior wall of the school and felt my jaw drop.
 Maybe Mom had read the story about the three little pigs a few too many times to me when I was growing up, but I'd always thought of brick as the strongest possible building material.
 I didn't have any idea if it really was, but it seemed incredible that anything could've wreaked such damage.
 The bricks on the wall next to the door were cracked and set back in the wall, almost like they'd been hit with some kind of wrecking ball, and the concrete of the sidewalk had gouges crisscrossing its surface like some kind of abstract painting.

When tempted by the Immortalists with a new body, he had accepted.
 Even though such action was anathema to the very teachings of the Order, he had become an officer of the Immortal Guards, and eventually their leader.
 Several of the most powerful Knights had over the centuries, formed the officer core of The Immortal Guards.
 These Knights traded their honor for near immortality in the Guards.
 The Immortal Guards were all sigil warriors with one or several magical enhancements.
 They also had the best resources of the entire Eastern Realm, the most powerful enchanted armor, the best weapons; their officers rode Dire Beasts for steeds.
 Taking on a sigil warrior would be a huge challenge for Rodregas, or at least he thought it would be.
 He was still unclear of how strong and fast he was.
 His stomach hurt from his wound, but not as badly as it should.
 Clearly, the first step in his duty was to heal up from his wound and relearn how to fight in his new body.

His steps faltered only once.
 When Harruq moved to catch him, Qurrah glared and leaned against the side of a house.
 When a luckless orc rushed too close to the exit, Qurrah hurled the orb.
 Its explosion conjured shadows and shifting mists of violets and purples.
 The orc collapsed, white smoke rising softly from his tongue.
 In the sudden blinding light, Qurrah laughed.

 Dark magic poured in.
 Her arms and legs arched backward, her sword fell from her hand, and her mouth opened in a single, aching shriek.
 Bits of darkness flared from her mouth, her eyes, and her nostrils.
 Done, Velixar shoved her smoking body back into the alley and left her to die.

I was trying to figure out who had lifted it when Grey flashed back into view, hesitating only a moment as he considered the rock.
 At once, his face changed; he knew he‚Äôd been beaten.

 Ruby leaned into me, voice soft.
 ‚ÄúSteed is stronger than Grey.

He had brought a proper crow bar from his visit to the smith‚Äôs and made short work of the laboratory door.
 The room had several large circles in the floor and tables and shelves along the side.
 The shelves held bones and bowls of strange fluids and other items whose uses he could not imagine.
 Anything that felt foul he threw into the fireplace, after getting a good flame going.
 Several books and strange containers ended up in the fire, though he did find two books that felt of magic that he kept.
 He also found a small statue of a strange green mechanical frog that had that magic tingle to it.
 He could not imagine its use; it appeared a simple toy, but he put it in his pile to take.
 There was a heavy oak cabinet in the corner which he forced open.

So, you are a lot more sensitive to the power that the books have.
 But what separates Grimoires from other books is that they are made like the stone walls of these buildings, by Nymphs.
 It is thought that the original reason was simply to have books that would not rot over a period of centuries, but the nymph-created paper and leather can hold a faint imprint of magic.
 ‚ÄúEach time that the sorcerers cast a spell from the book, it lightly engraved the pattern into the paige.
 A mage can sense the previous patterns in the book.
 The ability of such books to show the pattern of the spell means that even a mage who knows a spell by heart can cast it faster by using such a book.
 It also means that such books are much sought after and never given up freely.
 Grimoires are nearly never sold, unless the owner dies.‚Äù She paused to make sure they were both following her and then continued, ‚ÄúWhile the Grimoires are a great tool for quick and accurate casting of a spell, it is even more potentially useful for someone trying to learn magic.
 Reading a regular book with the spell written down and trying to keep all the symbols and shapes just right in your head even as you fill the complex shape with power requires years to learn.
 But a powerful Grimoire can quickly show you the shape and help you learn new spells in weeks, instead of years.

 He lived for a day, during which we got confronted with the possibility that drove my story ‚ÄúCars‚Äù, that he might live another sixty years without the use of his marvelous brain.
 Or, a miracle might bring him back to life.
 A whole new question arises.
 What if, while Eric lay comatose, he was given once more the choice to live, as I'm coming to believe he was given the choice before leaving for the desert in Kenny‚Äôs mom‚Äôs Volkswagen?
 If Kenny were still alive, I would ask him to describe, as best his memory would serve him, Eric‚Äôs expression and voice when he insisted they leave without Billy and me.
 The Bible implies that Jesus, had he been a less than perfect, could have chosen another fate than crucifixion.
 Only he chose trust his father‚Äôs will above his own, which was limited by his humanity, as ours is, in spades.

We can solve today‚Äôs most pressing problems if we adopt a total approach which takes into account all the interrelated factors ‚Äì political, economic, technological, social and environmental ‚Äì rather than relying on partial strategies.
 Partial remedies, however welcome or desirable, can always generate side-effects ‚Äì such as the increase in social tensions and violence observed when increasing political and social freedom are not matched by increasing economic opportunity, or the rise in unemployment and arms exports that accompany a reduction in defence expenditure.
 The success of the Green Revolution was due to its integration of technological, institutional, commercial and public policy measures, while its short comings arose from its failure to integrate environmental factors, which are now being incorporated in agricultural development strategies.
 Comprehensive measures can eliminate the side-effects of partial progress.
 The progress of the whole depends on the progress of all its parts.
 Humankind is infinitely enriched by the qualitative diversity of culture and individual expression, but it is immeasurably impoverished by the quantitative abyss which separates the more fortunate from the rest of humanity.
 The most prosperous levels of society cannot fully and finally rise to higher levels of accomplishment and enjoyment without first ensuring that the less fortunate and less productive are helped to obtain the full fruits of life at the present level of social achievement.
 Social equity, apart from its moral value, is an essential condition for continued progress.
 A proper balance has to be found between the principles of freedom and social responsibility, competition and co-operation, and between public good and private profit.
 All individual achievement is based on prior social accomplishment.

Reporting must be made mandatory rather than voluntary, and an independent surveillance system should be established to monitor compliance.
 The five permanent members of the Security Council, which together account for 80 per cent of the world‚Äôs arms sales, should also set up a system for mutual consultation on all large weapons orders.
 Mahatma Gandhi once explained that his efforts to suppress the natural aggressiveness of the people during India‚Äôs freedom struggle resulted in an explosion of violence between Hindus and Muslims when the country was partitioned.
 Today, in the absence of opportunities for venting aggression in global wars, pent-up energies are finding other outlets for expressing violence.
 The only possible way to manage these innate aggressive forces is to meet them firmly.
 The international community has already shown, in the case of airline hijacking, that it is capable of effective action on a global scale when the necessary political will and commitment are forthcoming.
 By concerted measures, the rapid proliferation of hijackings has been virtually eliminated.
 Similar results can be achieved today drastically to curtail small arms proliferation and the drugs trade.
 The anti-social forces supporting these activities must be handled with the same firmness and determination applied to hijackers, regardless of whether they are governments, military, criminal or terrorist groups, corporations or banks.
 The power of these measures lies not in the enactment of laws but in their enforcement.

 My eyes shot open and I scanned the scene again.
 I forgot what I was looking for when I recognized a face, hooded in a cloak, fighting against her own.
 Junnie.
 She stared back at me for one brief moment before she turned to fight some invisible foe.

‚ÄúI am glad that you accepted my message,‚Äù he said to Seth and me.
 Then he turned to Emily and Jason and said, ‚ÄúAh, it‚Äôs great to meet the other two.‚Äù He beamed at all four of us.
 ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù Emily said, looking a little freaked out.
 ‚ÄúSo now that you‚Äôre here, are we going to get a move on or what?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh of course, follow me please.‚Äù He shuffled off and disappeared behind the statue.
 Jason raised an eyebrow.
 ‚ÄúWhere is he going?‚Äù Emily sighed.
 ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only one way to find out.‚Äù She walked behind the statue.
 Seth, Jason, and I followed her.
 As soon as I was on the other side, I gasped at what I saw.

He had no idea what she was trying to do, but at least they had something to try.
 He needed to keep Van‚Äôdret busy to give Imeralda time to do whatever magic she was going to cast.
 Rodregas turned to Van‚Äôdret and said, ‚ÄúWell, since you are killing us today, how about we make things interesting for both sides?
 I will answer a question of yours every time that you answer one of mine.‚Äù Van‚Äôdret expression darkened and he almost hissed his outrage, ‚ÄúYou would bargain with me, with your life held by a string?‚Äù For some strange reason that Rodregas was sure reflected a very deep character flaw, he felt his face break out in a very large toothy grin as he said, ‚ÄúAnd I have what to lose?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret stared at him for several long minutes before he shrugged and said, ‚ÄúVery well, ask me your question, but then you will answer mine or you die.‚Äù Rodregas simply nodded.
 He had no lack of questions, but was not sure which to ask first.
 He decided going small first would cause a less violent reaction.
 Rodregas said, ‚ÄúHow did you find us down here?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs expression at the question was like he had asked why is the sky blue.
 He nearly sneered his answer, ‚ÄúThrough magic, of course, a simple tracking spell.‚Äù Van‚Äôdret did not go small, ‚ÄúAre you three responsible for the death of the Immortalist Sorcerer Ravenhurr?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes and no,‚Äù responded Rodregas.
 He almost left it at that, but decided to continue, ‚ÄúI killed Ravenhurr during the Ceremony of Ascension.
 I threw him into his own consuming flames.

It's just more dominance games."
 I nodded.
 It made sense, but it was all I could do to keep my eyes grounded despite the cold prickles running up and down my spine.
 Actual conversation was just too much, so I sat quietly with my head slightly bowed while the song ran its course.
 Alec's fingers gently pulled my chin up as the music ended.
 "Dance with me?"
 I mustered a brave smile as I nodded and let him lead me out onto the dance floor.
 It was a slow song this time, and Alec didn't protest when I abandoned all pretense of actual dancing, and just leaned into him hungrily.
 The reassurance I was seeking was weaker than normal.
 The solid feel of his body was just as permanent as always, but there was no tingle where our skin touched.

Though, I do not think that harness is big enough to fit you without some work.‚Äù Rodregas held his last unclaimed short sword up and said, ‚ÄúAnd here is one for you, Imeralda.‚Äù She picked it up, but he could tell she did not know how to handle the weapon.
 Doi‚Äôvan looked comfortable enough, but the handle was almost too small for his large hand and it looked more like a large dagger in his hand than a sword.
 ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a bow hidden in that wagon do you?
 I have no idea how to use one of these pig stickers, but I am very good with a bow,‚Äù said Imeralda.
 She said it clearly expecting him not to have anything.
 Rodregas did, have a bow.
 He had two very nice bows wrapped up in the wagon.
 But, while the short swords he handed them were dangerous, they were common and easy to replace.
 On the other hand, the Black Yew bows were rare and powerful.
 He also thought about the chain mail that he had found in Ravenhurr‚Äôs wardrobe.

Alec produced tickets for all of us from a pocket somewhere while I was still taking in the sheer number of lights that'd been assembled for the occasion.
 The decorations inside the pavilion were amazing.
 Swathes of silk gave the open-air building an ethereal feel, while candles and other light sources created a soft illumination.
 I didn't have to possess preternatural hearing to catch whispers about the city having received a very large, very anonymous donation just a few days before.
 The committee had obviously chosen to spend it on decorations.
 My newfound height put me closer to Alec's ear.
 I only had to tug on his arm a little bit to get him down to where I could whisper to him.
 "That was you, wasn't it?"
 "What if it was?"
 "It's too much.

The oldest trick in the effing book.
 It was quick and easy for them and we got to leave without a knife in our gut.
 Who were we going to tell?
 About a month after this robbery, I looked out the window of our apartment and to my surprise saw the guy who had set us up for the robbery!
 He was a tall lanky guy with a bushel of hair so he was easy to spot.
 I dragged Pete to the window to show him the guy.
 We hustled down the stairs and I walked straight towards this guy and he didn‚Äôt recognize me at all.
 He asked me if I wanted to buy some pot in exactly the same way he did before.
 I said, ‚ÄúSure, should we follow you to the same apartment so your friends can rob us again?‚Äù He looked shocked and before he could say a word, I dropped him with one punch where he stood and it didn‚Äôt stop there.
 This guy was begging for his life as I pummeled him and Pete just watched in shock.

"Come on--dinner's almost ready."
 She enjoyed the meal he'd prepared, and her eyes grew wide with delight when he set dessert in front of her.
 "I love chocolate ice cream!"
 she exclaimed.
 "I'm not surprised."
 He smiled as she ate with relish.
 Every woman he knew loved chocolate, and it was rather comforting to think that there were some things that transcended time.
 After they'd finished their ice cream, Rick rose and began to clear the table.

Don't open it now, but I hope you like it."
 I whispered thanks as I hugged her goodbye, and then made my halting, limping way into the house.
 I was only in the house for fifteen minutes before I realized being all by myself was a terrible idea.
 At some point I transitioned from just crying to having a full-blown panic attack.
 It should've terrified me that something new was bringing on an episode, but it was like there was so much else going wrong I couldn't spare any more emotional energy.
 I came out of the attack and remained on the floor thinking about all of the good times I'd had with Dad and Cindi.
 The memories should have made me feel better, but they had the opposite effect.
 I felt the tears start again as I realized all that goodness and joy was gone from my life forever.
 As my immunity started to wear off, I gratefully surrendered to the next attack, and the blissful relief it represented.
 I knew I was on track to drop back into the funk that'd robbed me of the weeks immediately after they died, but I was still strangely numb in the parts that should have cared.

A second son, Bryce, was added to our family two years later.
 I have tried to explain to my friends with no children yet that having children changes everything suddenly.
 Every day, sometimes every second, delivers a new challenge.
 As much as they want me to tell them what to expect, I cannot prepare them, as no one could have ever prepared me.
 I have told my friends to imagine driving down a beautiful highway on the way to a vacation spot in the mountains, with all of your plans for the trip clearly in your mind.
 Now imagine that your car‚Äôs emergency brake is unexpectedly pulled‚Äî hard‚Äî your calm drive is suddenly spinning out of control.
 You don‚Äôt know which way to turn the wheel or what pedal to push.
 You just act and react and pray for the best all within a moment.

I didn't unwrap either of them.
 That was dangerous too.
 The face that'd look back out of the glass would look almost more like hers than mine.
 Shoulder-length blond hair and blue eyes still seemed to be all the rage, but mine were ruined by pale skin that burned instead of tanning, and a build that had retained its baby fat long after most of the other girls had started slimming down.
 Those extra inches had evaporated recently, but of course it couldn't be a cause for celebration.
 When Mom surfaced enough to notice how much weight I'd lost, she worried I was developing an eating disorder.
 She couldn't seem to understand that I hated the new me more than she did.
 Cindi was the skinny one.
 I'd tried to make myself eat enough to fill back out, but I'd had a hard time remembering meals lately.
 It was easier to just cinch my pants up a little and avoid mirrors.

Both the knights and the squires always started off the day with a prayer to the Celestial Gods.
 I have not done this in over forty years, but I am going to start again and I would like you to join me if you would.‚Äù The two looked at Rodregas, they were very different people, but they both seemed unsure what to say to his request.
 Finally, Doi‚Äôvan nodded at Imeralda and said to Rodregas, ‚ÄúIt has been too long since I have prayed as well, it would be good for the soul.
 Please lead us in prayer.‚Äù Imeralda did not say anything, but she nodded and followed the two of them outside.
 Rodregas knelt in the grass facing the sun, the sign of the All-Father in the celestial heavens.
 He reached out and wove his fingers together; he pulled his thumbs down and opened his woven hands in the ancient symbol of opening oneself to the gods.
 ‚ÄúDear Celestials in the heavens, we open our hearts to you and we accept our duties as your warriors here in the world.
 Let your courage fill our hearts and your strength fill our arms.
 May we know the guidance of your twin children, Honor and Justice.‚Äù He then knelt down and pulled one of the two short swords from his weapon harness; he crossed his arms and laid the blade across his own upper arms.
 It was possible, only with great concentration to do this without dropping the sword or cutting himself.

There was probably money in the purser‚Äôs office, but he knew that the door, as well as the room was rigged with poison needles and other traps, both mundane and magical.
 Rodregas had the impression that Ravenhurr had spent most of his wealth of late on the Dire Cats.
 After Rodregas‚Äô recent generosity, he did not want to take the risk of dying for a nearly empty treasure box.
 He looked out of the entrance, over to the gate and up to the top of the wall where a small tower provided cover.
 There, one of the few guards left should be watching the front gate.
 Also kept in the tower were two of the nicest weapons Rodregas had ever seen: a pair of recurve bows of Wood Nymph created black yew.
 There was no way they would have been taken.
 There were standing orders to kill anyone who tried to remove them.
 Rodregas was not a very good bowman, but he was definitely going to try to bring them with him.
 He peeked out of the main doors and looked around the open keep.

Over the past decade, changes in the employment picture lend credence to ICPF‚Äôs perspective.
 The American economy experienced a decade-long expansion, fuelling high levels of employment at home, while stimulating job growth throughout East Asia, attracting a massive influx of foreign technical workers and setting the stage for a global outsourcing boom which is still in its infancy.
 Among the advanced economies, unemployment declined from an average of 6.9 per cent in the period 1985-94 to 6.5 per cent during the last 10 years.
 It fell by 10 per cent in France, 25 per cent in Italy, a third in Netherlands, 50 per cent in Spain and 70 per cent in Ireland.
 It is declining but remains 10 per cent higher than the average for 1985-94 in Germany, which is still recovering from the economic impact of reunification.
 The new market economies of Eastern Europe are growing rapidly.
 But these positive trends are no grounds for complacency.
 While they may dispel fears of an irreversible shrinkage of the job market in OECD countries, the proportion of long term unemployed remains at an unacceptably high 29 per cent of the total, indicating that these countries have not yet evolved successful strategies to address the issue.
 Left to itself, unemployment may continue to deprive large numbers of people in these countries from enjoying basic economic rights, unless concerted steps are taken to remove the perceptual and structural barriers to full employment.
 While data on unemployment levels in most developing countries is of doubtful accuracy and recent data are difficult to obtain, there is no question that the problem remains severe, especially among youth and the educated.

This makes the strengthening of job placement systems a crucial element in any full employment strategy.
 Lack of access to information about job or training opportunities retards re-employment.
 Sweden operates one of the most extensive and efficient employment services, in close cooperation with business, that is responsible for filling 60 per cent of total job vacancies.
 Improve labour market information systems within and between countries by increasing the accuracy and comparability of data, requiring mandatory reporting by businesses of all sizes, and freely exchanging information between cities, states and countries on successful employment-generating strategies.
 8.Raise minimum standards for education: Higher education increases productivity, raises personal expectations and consumption, and generates additional jobs in education and elsewhere.
 Lack of qualifications, inadequate and out-dated skills commonly characterize the long-term unemployed.
 There is a strong positive correlation between higher education and higher incomes.
 The employment rate for college graduates in the United States is 75 per cent versus 48 per cent for high school drop- outs; at the height of the recent recession, 3.2 per cent of college graduates were unemployed compared with 11.4 per cent of high school drop-outs.
 Only 57 per cent of 18-year-olds in the OECD countries are pursuing formal education.
 The Japanese built their highly competitive workforce by raising the educational attainments of the bottom half of their primary and secondary school population.

"The first winner is Pam White."
 Somewhere down the hall I heard someone yell, and then an entire class broke out into cheers.
 I knew I should be happy for Pam, but I was too busy wishing everyone would quiet down so we could hear the next name.
 Mrs. Alexander shut the door, muting the roar as Principal Gossil continued with a slight rustle of papers.
 "Also winning a ticket to Les Mis√©rables next weekend, Mr. Andrew Webbs."
 A couple of half-hearted cheers broke out towards the front of the class, but they were short-lived.
 Andrew wasn't in the class, and his friends were probably spending almost as much time thinking about their odds of still winning, as I was.
 I only had three chances left, three in two hundred assuming that everyone else in the school had entered the drawing, which was virtually guaranteed.
 "And the third lucky person is Suzanne Bergerman."
 And my chances were down to two, with even worse odds than I'd had a second before.

Only the top ten finishers qualified.
 There was no taking turns.
 The ten were spread out in a circle.
 In the center of the arena was a shield painted with the seal of the knighthood, a winged sword in the clouds.
 The squire who claimed that shield and made it to the Cathedral‚Äôs main hall with it would be knighted on the spot by the Knight Commander of the Order.
 This day would decide Rodregas‚Äô fate.
 It was likely to end in defeat.
 He stood flexing his sore shoulders, waiting for the flag to drop.
 Across from him was Geriodon who was standing tall and ready in his Night Bronze armor.

 I nearly protested, but Alec was right, it would take an actual order to get Donovan to slow down, and two days was probably pushing it.
 Donovan somehow managed to respectfully circumvent any order he thought prevented him from taking adequate care of Alec's family.

 I blinked a couple of times.

Despite the massive efforts of international institutions to create awareness of the vital role of education in peace, democracy, economic development, population control and environmental protection, progress on extending the benefits of education to all humankind is still grossly inadequate.
 In 1990, 948 million people or about 20 per cent of the entire world population lacked even basic literacy skills.
 Adult literacy rates in the least developed nations still average less than 50 per cent and are less than half that in a number of countries.
 Unless more intensive efforts are made, worldwide the absolute number of the illiterate will decline only marginally by the year 2000.
 Illiteracy is likely to increase by 10 per cent in South Asia ‚Äì home to more than 40 per cent of the world‚Äôs illiterate ‚Äì and by nearly 7 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa.
 Although universal primary education has been a goal for decades and primary education has been made compulsory in most countries, 128 million children living in remote rural areas, urban slums and refugee camps ‚Äì representing 20 per cent of the total school-age population ‚Äì are still excluded from primary education.
 Unless greater measures are introduced, this number may rise to more than 160 million by the turn of the century.
 Achieving true universality of primary education by the year 2000 will require a massive investment in school buildings, teachers and instructional materials for an additional 230 million school-age children.
 An additional 4 million teachers will be required, 20 per cent more than in 1990.
 In sub-Saharan Africa, gross primary enrolment will have to double before year 2000 to achieve this goal.

 He smirked and I couldn't hold back the urge to slap him.
 I slapped my hand across his face so hard it left a mark on his cheek.

Fear over the destruction of manufacturing jobs due to adoption of capital intensive technology has been prevalent for the past 100 years.
 Every new technology that automates a process or increases worker productivity has been perceived as a threat to the future of work.
 The reality has proved to be quite different.
 Technological development propels a spiral of economic development that creates many more jobs than it destroys.
 The most striking testimony to this fact is the history of employment in USA, arguably the country that has most readily and fully adopted new technologies over the past century.
 Employment in manufacturing and mining grew to a peak of about 40 per cent of the workforce after World War II before beginning its downward spiral to 15 per cent by 2000, about the same proportion as in 1850.
 Yet, during this same period total employment in America has expanded phenomenally, from a mere 13 million workers in 1870 to 68 million in 1955 and more than 136 million in 2002.
 In spite of all the automation and all the export of jobs to lower wage economies, the percentage of the American population employed has continued to rise over time.
 Several factors are responsible for this result, among which population growth and technological development are most prominent.
 Rising levels of technological sophistication certainly displace workers in most fields of manufacturing.

Distance education provides new opportunities for achieving the goal of education for all within a span of a few years.
 The Challenge and the Opportunity
 The problem of unemployment is of relatively recent origin.
 The very idea of employment as opposed to livelihood is a recent conception born of the Industrial Revolution.
 In principle, every human being born creates at least the potential for his own employment, because his very birth generates demand for additional products and services and because each individual possesses the innate capacity to acquire productive skills and creative knowledge capable of generating new products and services to meet new and existing social needs.
 That is why, in spite of rapid strides in the mechanization of agriculture and mass production in manufacturing, the six-fold multiplication of human population since 1800 has been accompanied by a more or less equivalent growth of employment opportunities.
 The present job gap is small compared with the enormous expansion of the labour force.
 As people develop, their aspirations rise and higher level needs emerge ‚Äì needs for education, health care, balanced diet, entertainment, travel and communication ‚Äì multiplying demand for new workers to provide them.
 Of course, there can be and are temporary dislocations and disorientations, sometimes severe, resulting from the rapid speed of social transformation that makes existing attitudes and skills obsolescent within a lifetime or less and compels human beings to learn to adapt faster and further than ever before in human history.
 This is the challenge posed by the evolution of humanity from the physical to mental stage, the flip side of the process that has given birth to all the miraculous achievements of the past few hundred years.

Only the bell should have rung by now, and it hadn't.
 I looked up at the clock and it confirmed that there was still at least a minute before class started.
 A slight rustle to my right brought my head around, and I looked up to find Alec smiling at me.
 I couldn't remember for sure if he'd ever smiled at me before, but I found myself suddenly positive he hadn't.
 I would have remembered such a strangely innocent expression.
 Brandon's smile was one of the most genuine I'd ever seen, the kind of thing that only the most deceptive person could possibly pull off and not mean.
 Alec's smile was like the first bloom on a flower, something so new, so unpracticed that there wasn't any possible way it was anything other than sincere.
 It made me tingle all over, and want to giggle like I was still six.
 Several seconds passed before I realized I'd been unconsciously returning his smile.
 I felt a blush slowly rising past my throat, but I couldn't look away.

At the end of every confession he would ask if we would accept him back into the family to which we always answered yes!
 Every time Brandon called he seemed more mentally clear.
 Brandon‚Äôs counseling had revealed several things that had caused him to bury himself in drugs and he was learning how to manage those painful experiences.
 One big event was when our son received a call from another friend of his while we were away on a family vacation.
 The friend told Brandon that his best friend, Tom, had been in a horrible car accident and was near death.
 Our son, like Tom, just sixteen years old, was hysterical, and we returned home immediately.
 It seemed like half of the high school was holding a vigil at the hospital when we arrived.
 Tom was paralyzed from the waist down in the accident.
 Car washes were held as fundraisers for this handsome and popular young man whose family had no health insurance.
 Tom was always such a bright spot and had an infectious personality.

I drifted off to History thinking that I would've done almost anything to save my sister.
 It would take a real heartless individual to abandon their own family.
 My anger buffered me just enough to think about Cindi without the usual consequences, but I still wasn't really in top form.
 I was halfway through my class before I realized Mr. Simms had been shooting me dark looks for the last twenty minutes.
 They weren't the obvious nasty looks that kids shoot each other of course.
 They were subtle and infrequent but there was something about the set of his mouth that made it clear he wasn't pleased I was in his class.
 I shrugged it all off and gutted my way through class, eagerly planning what I'd say to Alec when I saw him in physics, only when I finally stalked into Mrs. Alexander's class Alec wasn't sitting in his corner desk.
 I pulled out my notes and started reviewing what I'd managed to learn about our project, stalling until he arrived so I could give him a piece of my mind.
 Only he never walked through the door.
 I still had my anger, but it wasn't cushioning me as well for some reason.

He reached out to squeeze her hand.
 "I've never seen a picture of her or even heard of her, but I'd bet money that she's not as sexy as you."
 Her blush deepened, and his grin mellowed into a loving smile.
 He took her hand and pressed his lips into her palm.
 "You're the most beautiful woman in the world, Marie."
 This evening was a wonderful end to a wonderful day.
 Like the day before, what Rick had enjoyed most was seeing Marie's pleasure.
 She'd wanted to see everything, experience everything they'd let her try.
 Everyone had treated her like an eager tourist, little realizing that she was seeing it all from the perspective of someone who'd seen debuts of Hollywood's earliest offerings.

He'd obviously missed her as much as John had, and as he'd escorted her in to dinner, he'd whispered that he'd pick her up at 8:00 Saturday to take her to a speakeasy.
 "Maybe you could join us at the Cape one weekend, Tom," Mrs. Tranton suggested.
 "Oh?
 Are you leaving soon?"
 "In two weeks.
 Marie and I are going to spend three weeks there, and Jefferson and John will drive out on the weekends.
 You could come with them."
 Marie had been looking forward to going to the Cape, but listening to her mother talk about it, she wasn't so sure she was up to going.
 She needed the familiarity of home.

No magic.
 I could see why they used weapons.
 Chevelle pushed harder, assaulting me with faster and stronger swings.
 I was able to defend myself if I focused.
 Murmurs of approval floated in from our audience.
 I enjoyed that more than I probably should have.
 I concentrated hard and began throwing a few good hits of my own in with the blocks.
 Our swords clashed repeatedly, neither of us hitting the mark.
 I was certain he could have, but confident I was blocking well.
 We continued until I became winded, then Chevelle lowered his blade, smiling with approval.

I yawned and stretched, and then followed her out of the room.
 I was surprised at the size of the fort.
 We went down several corridors and passed a few doors before finally coming to a large, open arena where the others waited for us.
 Chevelle smiled at me as I passed him on the way to my horse.
 I started to command the horse to kneel, but then Steed grabbed me at the waist and threw me up.
 I took one deep breath before we kicked the horses into a gallop and ran from the fort in a pack.
 Our pace finally slowed as the way became too treacherous.
 Massive rock formations loomed over us, loose stones underfoot causing the horses to stumble.
 The haze was so thick I couldn‚Äôt see anything but the riders in front of me.
 I only knew from the strain on my legs we were heading up, climbing higher into the gray sky and biting wind.

 But I was afraid that telling you would make it harder to leave.

 The smell of cooked meat cut through my thoughts.
 I ran a hand through my wet hair and walked out to the fire.
 The scene wasn‚Äôt any less impressive this time, and I sat on one of the large, flat rocks facing the lake.
 Chevelle brought me a plate of food, settling in beside me.
 There were berries and roots, and a rich, savory meat that dripped onto my hands as I tore into it.
 It was a feast compared to what I‚Äôd been eating.
 And even though he was my watcher, my captor, I had to admit I felt less alone with Chevelle there.
 Steed pulled his own ration from the spit and sat on my other side as we all watched the surface of the lake.

You've got her now, but at what cost?
 This isn't open to discussion.

 In an effort to see better, Rachel and I had moved slightly to the side.
 Alec reached back without looking and moved us directly behind him.
 It wasn't until his arm brushed me that I realized he was shaking ever so slightly himself.
 "There's only one way you're going to touch her, James.
 Are you really ready to take that step?"
 I felt shivers run down me as I realized just how easily everything could boil over into deadly violence.
 The tension in the room pulsed out in waves, skittering many-legged across my skin like something that belonged under a rock somewhere.

I didn‚Äôt get the joke.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre serious?‚Äù Steed said, humor vanished as he gaped at Chevelle.
 ‚ÄúWhat, she‚Äôs a bright lighter?‚Äù Chevelle was across the gap and in his face almost before Steed could stand.
 I jerked back in response, but a screeching siren pierced my ears and I doubled over, covering them.
 It was inside, a screaming, terrible howl coming from my ears.
 I tried to force my eyes open, hoping someone would help me, but they were just standing there, chest to chest, arguing.
 Did they not see me?
 I ached to scream for help, but couldn‚Äôt get a sound out, couldn‚Äôt breathe.
 They leaned toward each other, oblivious to anything else.
 My eyes closed as I curled into a ball.

The fact is, this man was never a father or a dad or anything to me.
 Richard basically knocked my mother up in high school, married her, had another son and abandoned her and his sons while they were still babies.
 He never paid my mother a dime in child support.
 My mother tried to warn me when I decided I wanted to meet him, but as only time would tell, trying to tell your teenage son anything is a virtual impossibility.
 After I graduated high school, I went to Hawaii with a friend to live.
 The simple reason?
 I was eighteen and that was drinking age in Hawaii.
 I quit my grocery job and took the money I had saved and headed off to the islands.
 Once there, we pretty much surfed, drank and looked for pot.
 We were on an extended vacation and my best friend Pete, who went with me, was a spoiled brat with an endless supply of money from his father who was one of the Greek associates of my stepfather, Dino.

My groan brought a smile to his face.
 "I can ship pesky parents out of the country, but if you start a wholesale program of cutting class your mom will find out when she gets back."
 "So I just go about my day like normal, pretending like I don't know Brandon's a psychopath who just happens to be able to change shapes at will and rip big holes in brick walls?"
 I finally rolled out of bed, and started picking through the pile of bags from our shopping trip, hoping to find something that wouldn't make it look like I'd just won the lottery or robbed a bank.
 "Now you know how Rachel feels.
 I'm afraid that with only a couple of differences, it'll be business as usual."
 I finally settled on a white button-up, and headed to the bathroom so I could change.
 "So are you going to tell me what the differences are, or is that part of the stuff I'm not allowed to know?"
 Alec's chuckle was muffled by the closed door, but still brought a smile to my face.
 "The biggest difference will be that we're going to have to shuffle some class schedules to make sure Brandon and his pack don't have access to you or Rachel.

 Rick had kissed her more times last night than Davis had the entire time they'd been together, and she couldn't look at him without thinking of those kisses.
 Silently Rick took her hand and led her downstairs.
 In the garden, he took her face between his hands, kissing her softly.
 "If you get home, I'll miss you."
 "I'll miss you too," she whispered, hugging him.

The over-tinted windows smoothly slid down to reveal that James was indeed the driver, and he wasn't any happier than he'd been a few seconds earlier.
 I started towards the back seat, only to feel Rachel's surprisingly-firm grasp guide me towards the front seat.
 She got me settled and then slipped in behind me.
 James pulled out of the parking lot with a rush of acceleration that pinned me to my seat.
 Normally I'd have gripped the door hard enough to make my fingers creak, but I was still strangely unconcerned with the possibility of dying.
 For the first time in months I simply slouched down in my seat and enjoyed the ride.
 The little Accord zipped around corners faster than I would've believed possible, its tiny engine howling as the turbos wound up in between shifts.
 My bemused state was interrupted by Rachel leaning forward and tapping me on the shoulder as she gestured for James to turn his music down.

As an interim measure and first steps, the immediate addition of five more permanent members to the Security Council, based on the criteria of population and economic status, and the abolition of the veto power are fully justified.
 However, these changes do not go far enough in furthering the interests of global peace and development.
 They will not fundamentally alter the out-dated, non-representative structure which perpetuates the status quo.
 It is time to devise a new formula and a new structure for international governance that will reconcile and harmonize the political rights and economic interests of all the world‚Äôs peoples.
 The institution that had come to symbolize the Cold War must be restructured in such a manner as to symbolize the abolition of all war and the establishment of peace and democracy as the foundations for global development.
 Global Social Revolution
 A second revolution also possesses tremendous transforming power to accelerate human progress ‚Äì the revolution of rising expectations.
 This revolution is not new in conception or expression, but what is new is its rapid extension to encompass people and nations around the globe.
 Although the term was first applied to describe the growing aspirations of the middle class in North America forty years ago, it is now widely applicable to all social and economic groups in both developed and developing countries.
 After countless centuries of slow, often imperceptible progress, humanity everywhere is on the move.

I was anxious to see the finished work.
 I waited impatiently for her to raise her head again and hoped whatever it was wasn‚Äôt permanent.
 She finally glanced up at me, smiling an easy smile.
 I looked nervously at my wrist.
 It was magnificent.
 A simple outline of a bird with outstretched wings marked the delicate skin at the base of my palm.
 Unbelievably tiny runes surrounded the bottom of its wings, making a pattern appear.
 I smiled as I praised her.

 I‚Äôve got a bunch more to learn.‚Äù The last couple months of that summer, while I smashed golf balls, played baseball in Mexico on Sundays, and visited my cousins in Pacific Beach, Eric ran around with Margaret Beasley, Pam Greenman, and Lane Campbell.
 Margaret had been my friend longer than anyone except my cousins.
 Since second grade.
 All through elementary school, she was always the smartest in class, and kinder than anybody else I knew.
 She spent eighth grade in my mom's English and Social Studies class.
 Later my mom called her the brightest student she ever taught.
 And her pure and soulful singing would land her, only months after high school, on a weekly television show with a folk group, The Good Time Singers.

 I elbowed Emily in the arm, ‚ÄúUh Emily, is a dwarf using a slide a normal thing?‚Äù I nodded in the direction of the dwarf and her eyes widened in surprise.
 She jumped off the swing and grabbed me by the arm.
 She ran over to Jason and gripped his arm with her free hand, pulling us both after her.
 Seth frowned but had no choice but to follow.
 ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the dwarf?‚Äù she asked quickly.

Integration of agriculture, marketing and processing
 Conscious efforts can be made to foster the natural linkage between agricultural and industrial development by placing emphasis on crops that have the greatest potential for stimulating the growth of agro-industries, services and exports.
 Filling in the missing links in the chain of processing and distribution, such as pre-cooling for fruit and vegetables, can enable small farmers to produce for national and export markets; it also results in higher at-farm prices and creates alternative forms of rural employment.
 Empowerment of women
 The vast majority of women living in rural areas are engaged in agriculture.
 Therefore, upgrading productivity, skills and incomes in this sector is the single most effective means of improving the livelihood of women in developing countries.
 Skill development programmes in areas such as hybrid seed production, floriculture, inland aquaculture, vegetables and poultry can be particularly beneficial.
 Promotion of micro-level credit institutions and savings programmes can generate capital for the establishment by women of small rural enterprises.

 His voice drifted off.
 Movement behind his army caught his eye.
 He shoved a few men aside, tore through the center of his army, and then emerged at the back.
 Far down the street, his robe flowing in a nonexistent wind, walked a pale man dressed in black.
 His low hood covered all but the chin of his face.

My head spun as I stood, but I steadied myself and moved to the basin to splash my face.
 As I looked in the mirror at my pallid complexion, my features twisted in horror.
 Understanding came suddenly and would not be denied.
 I scoffed at myself humorlessly as my words taunted me‚Äîjust harmless fun‚Ä¶ what could it hurt?
 For half a second, I wanted to scream.
 And then my hands found their way to my stomach and rested there.

 I opened my mouth to comment on the fact that Brandon's pack was roughly twice the size of ours, only to realize that scurrying back home kind of precluded continuing to help out at the tutor lab.
 "What about helping Mrs.

 It shouldn't have surprised me that Alec thought it over for several seconds before shaking his head.
 Whatever else he was, he wasn't the thoughtless jerk Brandon had proven himself to be.

Rachel had stood me up.
 She wasn't on the bus, and she apparently hadn't come with her brother, so she wasn't coming.
 I knew I should reserve judgment until I'd given her a chance to explain what'd happened, but it was hard to remember that when faced with Alec's air of superiority.
 Rachel was nicer, but she was still a Graves.
 Maybe this was just a sign of things to come.
 Apparently I wasn't the only one put off by Alec's snobbishness.
 A couple of guys who looked like they were old enough to be in college were rolling their eyes at him.
 They were whispering and laughing, but positioned as they were closer to Alec than to me, I couldn't make out any of what they were saying.
 While I agreed completely with their sentiment, they were so loud they were disturbing at least twenty or thirty people.

 "OK."  His eyes focused on her lips.
 His tiny bit of contact with them had been electric.
 He suspected that if he persisted, he could break down her resistance, but he cared about her too much to do that.
 Marie couldn't stop thinking about Rick's kiss.
 It had been brief, but she could remember everything about it in vivid detail.
 She closed her eyes as she stood in the shower, reliving the moment.
 In her mind she could see his face as he told her she was beautiful.
 Her heart had sped up then but nothing like when he'd tilted her chin up and looked into her eyes.

She pressed kisses along his neck and then across his jaw, finally reaching his mouth.
 Their kiss was slow and sweet, and Marie sighed into his mouth.
 "It's so nice," she murmured.

 He tangled his fingers in her hair as he bent to kiss her neck.
 "Being able to kiss the man I love whenever I want instead of having to wait for him to kiss me."

 The three stood there fighting to keep the horses from running and watched as the Dire Cats stepped through the main door for a moment, but left after only a short wait.
 The Dire Cats then circled the main building and went over to the far edge of the main house and then simply disappeared.

 Prescription drug abuse is an epidemic which claims the lives of our youth.

 I hope that this book and the website http://www.rxdrugaddict.comcan help addicts better understand that they are not just destroying themselves but also their family and friends.
 I hope they can see that they could have long and productive lives if they chose to feel life instead of numbing it.
 I also hope this can help people to think about their defining moments and to never give up on their addicted loved ones.
 Expecting someone to just stop being addicted is as absurd as asking someone to stop having cancer.
 These addicts need professional help from those who are trained in this field.
 We are ignorant and ill prepared to help and understand an addict and that ignorance could be deadly.
 We can only pray that these addicts can overcome their addiction and start living a clean and sober life one day at a time.

 Like maybe he was going to argue, but as he opened his mouth Rachel turned and glared at him.
 It seemed odd to see someone only a little smaller than Alec back away from someone even smaller than me.
 The image stuck with me so strongly that I considered it until Rachel came over and took my hand.
 "What's wrong?
 It's just the two of us now, you don't have to worry about James, and I won't tell anyone else.
 I swear."

"While I appreciate the sentiment, it really is far too late to secure absolution by bringing me the girl."
 His voice had changed, becoming deeper and harsher, with elements that didn't sound like they could come from any human throat.
 He stepped forward, and I felt my chest seize up.
 The transformation I'd sensed the beginnings of at the dance had run its course now and any question as to why someone as cultured as Brandon would associate with a near-psychopath like Vincent was put to rest.
 He was shaking now, quivering with the need to kill, and I realized that it didn't matter whether the darkness inside Brandon had created Vincent or just attracted him to orbit in his sphere like a small moon.
 It was enough to know that Vincent's was the lesser evil.
 "Adri is here solely as a witness."
 Alec's voice was huskier than normal, but still carried most of its velvety perfection.
 As I looked at him, I realized I wasn't feeling any power arcing from him.
 Everything centered on him now, but he wasn't adding to the storm.

Emily had offered to be the one who paced but Jason had waved away her offer and started pacing.
 So all Emily could do was sit there and twirl the arrow in fear because right now it wasn‚Äôt looking good for Jazell and Seth.
 ‚ÄúWhat I don‚Äôt get,‚Äù Jason said, ‚Äúis how the arrow managed to stay in perfect shape when the ground collapsed.
 The arrow should be broken and not sticking out of the ground a few feet away.‚Äù ‚ÄúMaybe she shot it after,‚Äù Emily suggested, because that meant that she was alive.
 Jason rubbed his eyes.
 ‚ÄúI guess that‚Äôs a possibility.
 Jazell and Seth were always too stubborn to die anyway.‚Äù He stopped pacing.
 ‚ÄúBut why would she shoot it up here?‚Äù ‚ÄúMaybe she wanted to show us that she was alive,‚Äù Emily said.

"Your hands, you tend to talk with them when you're excited or angry, and it's very distracting.
 I mean for us.
 All of the motion results in a hundred tiny signals flooding my brain as my instincts try to decide whether you're prey to be chased, or a bigger predator that I need to flee from."
 I felt my eyes go wide as I realized what he was saying.
 It made me think of the stray kitten we'd taken in for a few months when I was five.
 Cindi and I had spent hours teasing it with pieces of string, watching its tiny head dart back and forth from one to the other as it tried to decide whether to pounce on them, or dart away and hide under the bed.
 It'd been really amusing when it had been a half-pound kitten, but the thought of having a two-hundred-plus pound wolf attacking me because I'd triggered some kind of fight or flight instinct wasn't so funny.
 "Oh, I didn't realize it was a problem.

The fire in me itched to burn him.

 ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù I fumed, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm sure that has nothing to do with you rummaging around in there.‚Äù He shook his head and his complete lack of agitation caused me to take pause.
 I supposed it was possible he actually couldn‚Äôt free my thoughts.
 If the council had bound me, likely all of them would need to reverse it.
 And they wouldn‚Äôt do that.
 Because they had convicted me.
 I might have asked how the process would work, but I was too furious to pursue conversation with any kind of composure.

Their parents stood with the principal ready for their arrival at the office.
 As they entered the room it wasn‚Äôt hard to see the anger and disappointment.
 They were from different sides of this small town.
 My father‚Äôs dad was a butcher, his wife a seamstress.
 My mother‚Äôs dad was an oil rig grunt of American-Indian decent, and his wife, a meek submissive homemaker.
 Neither parent thought the other was good enough for their child, let alone the fact that they were both still children.
 Once the reason for the marriage was revealed, their parents accepted it as best as they could.
 My father‚Äôs parents arranged for them to live together in a small home while they finished school and awaited the birth of their baby.

Still, more than 800 million people spread throughout the developing world lack sufficient and secure access to nutritious food and clean drinking water.
 Between 1990 and 2000, malnutrition declined from 21 per cent to 18 per cent of the population of developing countries, but it actually increased marginally among the least developed nations, particularly in Africa.
 Incidence of malnutrition among children under five years of age remains severe in both Africa and South Asia.
 But the problem is more complex than these numbers suggest.
 Although India is considered a food surplus state, it is home to the largest number of undernourished people in the world and access to a balanced diet and clean drinking water is far below the basic requirements for sound health.
 Projections indicate that over the next decade growth of the world‚Äôs food supply will be adequate to meet the needs of all human beings.
 The UN Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of human beings suffering from hunger and malnutrition between 1990 and 2015 is highly commendable, yet achieving it would still leave an unconscionably large number of people without adequate food.
 More can and must be done in the next decade to eradicate the scourge of hunger.
 The problem of water scarcity is even more pervasive and challenging.
 Studies indicate that by 2015 more than half the world‚Äôs population ‚Äì mostly in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia and Northern China ‚Äì will be living in countries that are ‚Äòwater-stressed‚Äô.

If the rich countries, particularly USA, had met the UN development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of GDP, progress in improving the human condition in countries characterized by a high incidence of poverty would have been faster.
 These real and significant gains have been offset and to a large extent obscured in our minds by the persistence and aggravation of problems that constitute the other side of the post-Cold War ledger.
 Far from vanishing, the nuclear danger has been aggravated by the continued proliferation of nuclear weapons, the increasing danger of these weapons falling into the hands of terrorists, and the stubborn refusal of the existing nuclear powers to seize the opportunity to totally eradicate this pernicious arsenal of self-annihilation.
 Reduced confrontation between nation states has been followed by an aggravation of internal conflicts within countries as well as a dramatic increase in threats of violence by disenchanted minorities.
 Violent local conflicts continue to flare around the world.
 Terrorist acts have intensified against civilian populations on every continent.
 While the worst fears about rising unemployment in the West have been dispelled, the challenge of generating sufficient employment opportunities for all people around the world remains a pressing concern.
 The rich-poor divide has increased within and between nations.
 Inadequate job/livelihood opportunities resulting in inadequate purchasing power have now become the most important cause of endemic and hidden hunger.
 Most regrettable has been the failure to enhance the powers and strengthen reliance on effective multilateral institutions.

He did not think the knife had cut into anything too important; at least it was not bleeding too badly.
 He was surprised that he was not more tired; maybe his new body handled such things better and could make do with less sleep.
 He was usually a light sleeper and was very surprised that they had been able to get the drop on him.
 His guess was that the AElf maiden had cast some sort of spell on him to mask their approach, and he kept a close eye on her to make sure she did not repeat the effort.
 Of course she was also very nice to look at, so he did not need much of an excuse to enjoy the view.
 In the morning, he slowly pulled out some of the supplies and bundled them.
 He tried not to show how much he hurt.

 The forest was too far, and all about was shin-high grass.
 ‚ÄúNo choice,‚Äù he gasped.
 His entire right half of his body ached.
 ‚ÄúCelestia, grant me mercy.
 I cannot go further.‚Äù
 He stumbled to the ground.
 His face and armor were camouflaged with greens and browns, but just grass would make it difficult to go unnoticed.
 Still, he had no choice but to try.

Pete and I still drank and partied and the drugs were still around.
 Unlike most of the people I knew, I managed to be truly a recreational user with no tendencies towards addiction.
 But I am no prude, and we had our share of parties and events in Tahoe and at the waterbed store.
 When you put a bunch of twenty year olds and their friends in a retail store that has working hot tubs and waterbeds, things can quickly spiral out of control.
 We had no window coverings and our parties were in plain view of anyone who put their nose against the windows.
 It was a voyeurs‚Äô paradise and I am sure we entertained a lot of shocked window shoppers late into the night!
 Pete proved to be a bad choice of a business partner, as his use of cocaine escalated to the point of total addiction.
 In less than a year he would snort everything he could get his hands on.
 He was stealing money from the checking account and drop-shipping inventory from our business directly to drug dealers to feed his habit.
 My own brother Thomas was one of the many drug dealers receiving this merchandise for pennies on the dollar in exchange for cocaine and marijuana.

He was dressed in a long green cloak, silvery armor, and he bore his bow openly.
 Antonil could barely make out his features, since he was so far down the street.
 The elf halted, drew an arrow, and fired it into the air.
 It smacked the dirt an inch from Antonil‚Äôs foot.
 Sergan shook his head and stared in wonder at his commander.
 The man had not flinched.
 ‚ÄúI shall take that as your answer,‚Äù Antonil shouted to the town.

Most of the rest of the matches were with squires with no ribbons.
 But as the afternoon wrapped up his final match was against Karun who had two second place white ribbons on her arm.
 Rodregas was pretty sure this match would decide who got the yellow first place ribbon and who would get the white.
 If Rodregas won it would give him ten total points after three competitions.
 It would give Karun twelve points if she once more came in second.
 If he lost, it would be much harder.
 Karun would have thirteen and he would have nine points.
 He was not sure how Geriodon or Nordien or the other leading contestants were doing.
 At the bell the two started to circle.
 Karun was a large woman.

I managed a nod, and then the downstairs door crashed open.
 "Adri, honey.
 Where are you?"
 Alec was gone when I looked back.
 Only the slight sway of my curtains gave evidence he'd just casually jumped out of my second-story window.
 I heard Mom's equipment bags hit the floor one after another.
 The sound of her tromping up the stairs finally roused me from my state of shock.
 "I'm in my room, Mom."
 Apparently the sound of my voice was at least slightly reassuring, she was only a little wild-eyed by the time she opened the door and stuck her head in my room.

She kissed him, her hands moving restlessly over his chest.
 Nuzzling his ear, she told him, "It's probably wrong for me to tell you these things.
 But I want to tell you everything.
 I want you to know how I feel."
 Rick pulled her onto his lap and began devouring her mouth.
 If he didn't know better, he'd swear she was the most cunning seductress he'd ever known.
 Her innocence combined with her confession was a powerful aphrodisiac.
 She was so trusting and yet so passionate, her mouth as hungry as his, her hands caressing and clutching and clawing at his chest and shoulders and neck.
 Hadn't she understood a word he'd said?
 Rick let the embrace go on for as long as he could.

‚ÄúFrey,‚Äù Chevelle said, ‚Äúthis is Anvil.‚Äù He nodded toward a giant of a man who bowed his head respectfully.
 ‚ÄúAnd Grey.‚Äù The wiry man bent and straightened, his movements too quick.
 I drew in a startled breath as two more figures came into view.
 A pair of slender elves stepped in sync as they stopped just outside the group.
 They were tall and lean, dressed in robes the color of ash that only accentuated their shocking silver hair.
 I was convinced the moonlight must have been exaggerating it.
 And then I jumped again as, on either side of them, two beasts walked forward to stand just in front of the twinned elves.
 Steed brushed an arm against mine, mumbling under his breath, ‚ÄúYeah, they‚Äôre not from around here.‚Äù I felt myself leaning on Chevelle for support.
 ‚ÄúRhys and Rider Strong,‚Äù he said from behind me.

Suspension of voting rights or of the privileges of membership should be the ultimate penalty for the failure of governments to comply with this condition within a reasonable period of time.
 The affirmation of democratic principles cannot and will not stop with the domestic governance of member countries.
 It is inevitable that the same principles be extended to the relationships between the nations that make up the international community.
 The present structure of the UN system is a product of the Second World War, just as the League of Nations was of the First.
 The Allied powers conceived it at the height of the war and evolved its structure to reflect the immediate post-war realities.
 Russia, the USA, France and the UK emerged from the war as the arbiters of the world order.
 The defeated Axis powers, Germany and Japan, were relegated to the back ground.
 Mainland China had become communist and was therefore excluded from the power structure.
 India and the other colonies had not yet gained their freedom.
 In recognition of the mutual suspicions between Russia and the Western powers, the rule of unanimity usually adopted by political conferences was applied to decisions made by the five major powers that became the permanent members of the Security Council.

If Jessica hadn't grudgingly complimented me on just how good my hair looked, I might have suspected Jasmin was trying to purposefully make me look worse than the other girls.
 Dominic and Rachel had to tell me I looked good, that was an unwritten girl-rule regardless of what species you were.
 Jessica had no such imperative, so I was forced to conclude Jasmin had done the best she could considering what she had to work with, and resigned myself to being the homely one in the group.
 Still, seeing all of the other girls in one place, fully decked out in the kind of shoes I'd always wanted to wear, but never been able to pull off, was even more intimidating.
 I was once again psyching myself up to be seen in public, when Donovan limped into the room and cleared his throat.
 "The gentlemen have at long last arrived."
 Isaac was the first one through the door, looking particularly 007 in a tux that amazingly enough had the occasional silver thread that matched perfectly with Jessica's dress.
 I looked up from his outfit just in time to see a flash of concern melt away into relief.
 I had just a moment to wonder at the novelty of Isaac showing that much emotion all at one time, and then James stalked through the door in a tux that was so cutting edge, that I wasn't sure if there was anything else like it anywhere in the States.

Luckily I'd worn sneakers rather than the exotic footwear most girls gravitated towards.
 If I'd been wearing anything else, I'd have been nursing blisters before I made it out of the parking lot.
 As it was, I quickly realized my little walk home was going to be twice as unpleasant as I'd expected.
 The school most definitely wasn't in the pretty, green part of the region.
 Every step kicked up a miniature cloud of fine, red dust that drifted into my lungs and slowly coated my clothes.
 The dust would've been plenty bad all by itself, but the heat made things even worse.
 It was only an hour or two removed from the hottest part of the day, and the air was so dry it sucked moisture out of me with each breath.
 I knew it was stupid to walk home.
 My one little bottle of water wasn't going to last me five miles in this oven, but I was tired of always having to be sensible about everything.

 As always, Rachel was sitting at her table in the middle of no-man's-land.
 She looked up at me and smiled as I took my usual spot and started on my homework.
 For the first time all day I felt like I could relax.
 The few times I looked up, I saw Britney, who seemed determined not to give in and actually do her homework.
 I finished my two assignments about the time I normally did, and walked over to where Mrs. Campbell was trying to explain a story problem.

The drapes were swaying gently as if they'd been brushed by someone moving quickly, but other than that there was no trace of him.
 It wasn't until I'd filed out into the grand foyer, eager to spend a few minutes taking in the gorgeous bronze statues liberally scattered throughout the room, that I realized why I felt so odd.
 Part of the difference was the normal sensation of having vicariously been part of something larger than life.
 My head knew all I'd done was sit motionless while performers portrayed a fictional story.
 The rest of me felt as though I had just risked life and limb, seen people I loved killed, and played a small but tangible part in altering the course of history.
 Returning to my mundane, ever so boring life was an incredible letdown, but that didn't explain the hollow sensation that'd lodged itself somewhere between my heart and stomach.
 Illogical as it sounded, the only explanation for feeling as though a part of me had been ripped out and lost was Alec's having disappeared sometime between the last note and the final bow.
 It was unsettling.
 Even my growing feelings for Brandon didn't hint at that kind of need.
 It was a pale shadow of what it felt like to lose a family member, but it was made up of too many of the same elements.

Mr. Simms seemed especially dense, and pretty much let everyone do whatever they wanted for the entire class.
 In deference to my new dedication to academic excellence, I finished up the reading, and then opened up my Biology book and started trying to get a handle on all of the items I'd thought I understood, but apparently hadn't.
 When the bell rang I limped back to my locker before making my painful way to Physics.
 I almost turned around and left when I saw the substitute again, but almost two decades of ingrained respect for authority figures propelled me into the room and to my seat.
 I happened to look up at the exact moment that Alec appeared in the doorway.
 I expected him to take one look at the sub and turn around like he'd done before, but he registered the presence of a substitute and then came inside regardless.
 It didn't make sense until the first girl all but fainted as he walked past her desk.
 Of course.
 He didn't like substitutes, and figured he had better places to be, but the draw of hero worship after having almost double-teamed Vincent was just too much to resist.
 The sub took a desultory roll, and then waved his hands at us.

 She returned it briefly and then pulled away, hiding her face against his shoulder in confusion.
 How could she like Rick's kiss more than Davis'?

 Rick drew in a shaky breath, laying his cheek against her hair.
 That one small, hesitant kiss had been so exciting that he knew he'd be lost if she ever kissed him the way he wanted.

The men of Neldar had their shields raised high, but the synergy between the elves in the home and the elves on the street was superb.

Rodregas swung at him and retreated.
 The two shared several blows.
 The third time that he retreated after taking a blow, the guard went for the kill.
 The guard extended his whole body out in a lunge, thrusting his long sword out to its full length.
 The guard saw Rodregas‚Äô braided leather armor and steel sword and thrust with the point.
 The lunge was perfect, the guard went for dead center, and even though Rodregas had been waiting for a similar move, the thrust almost caught him off guard.
 The guard had only one problem, one that he could not have anticipated.
 Rodregas had been taking easy swings, not revealing his true speed.
 Once the guard committed, Rodregas brought both of his swords down and met the lunging blade.
 Rodregas could not meet his sword edge to edge, but it was thrusting out and he caught it and pushed it down and to the left.

‚ÄúWhere are you, brother?‚Äù Qurrah asked once he could breathe freely.
 In the dark before the dawn, it seemed he would receive no answer.
 At last, he could travel no more.
 He had no food, no destination, and no company.
 His limbs were weak and his head throbbed.
 To his knees he slumped, and he let time pass and his strength return, while his mind rummaged for ideas of how to proceed.

If Jasmin was dating Alec, why was she so mad at Lucy for talking to this Ben boy?
 I hadn't seen any other boys who were even close to as attractive as Alec and Brandon, and Jasmin didn't seem like the type to pick substance over form.
 Britney had wandered off to other, safer subjects.
 I nodded a lot and tried to avoid thinking about what life was going to be like if Jasmin was determined to kill me.
 There was just no way to know if I'd made the right choice in leaving when I did.
 Would Cassie hate me a little less because we were both potentially in Jasmin's crosshairs, or would she hate me all the more because I'd seen her humiliated and forced to back down?
 I finally finished the little can that represented my lunch.
 I wasn't particularly hungry, but I couldn't lose much more weight without Mom dragging me into a doctor.
 Besides, it gave me an excuse to try and ignore the fact that half of the people in the room seemed to be staring at me when they thought I wasn't looking.
 I finally worked up enough courage to look across the cafeteria as I peeled the label off of the can.

 ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù I finally choked out, but they were tight-lipped.
 ‚ÄúHow do you feel?‚Äù Chevelle asked.
 His tone was off, a little shaky.
 I couldn‚Äôt tell if he was cross or something else.
 There was something so familiar about him, the way he leaned over me, but my thoughts weren‚Äôt working right yet.

Under normal circumstances we'd be able to determine whether or not they'd been here in the last few days, but the rainstorm last night was strong enough to wash away all of that."
 Alec waited patiently as I tried to get a grip on myself.
 As soon as I nodded he disappeared through the door.
 A few seconds later he was back.
 "It's safe; there's no trace of them."
 He held the door open for me, and then slipped outside.
 "You need to erase any evidence that you weren't here all night.

I wanted nothing!
 Eating was the last thing on my mind and my stomach was churning with every passing moment.
 I just wanted to get on with it and go home in one piece.
 It was an odd sight for me as I watched these officers chow down their burgers and sip on their drinks reminiscing about the drug deal they just finished.
 Just another day at the office, I guess.
 In a moment, my crack-berry starts to blow up with one call after the next from Ashley, wanting to know when we are doing this deal.
 I must keep buying time with excuses, now nearing a two-hour delay waiting for the cops to come from the other bust.
 It is looking like this deal is not going to happen either.

It seemed like a long time.
 Rick was in the hall waiting for her.
 She blushed when she looked into his eyes.
 She'd spent the previous evening cuddled up to him, returning the gentle kisses he'd kept raining on her lips.
 Rick had kissed her more times last night than Davis had the entire time they'd been together, and she couldn't look at him without thinking of those kisses.
 Silently Rick took her hand and led her downstairs.
 In the garden, he took her face between his hands, kissing her softly.
 "If you get home, I'll miss you."
 "I'll miss you too," she whispered, hugging him.
 She made herself focus her mind on her parents as she wandered through the garden.

 After they'd put in a load of clothes, they had some ice cream and then returned to the living room to read.
 Rick had gotten her the Dragonriders of Pern series, since those books were about a world that was new to all readers and had very few offensive elements.
 She'd wanted some romances, but he was afraid that they'd be too explicit for her.

When you boiled it all down, I had a grand total of two friends in Sanctuary.
 Rachel and Brandon, both of who seemed to dislike the other, and neither of whom I was really sure I could count on.
 It was fine to only have two friends, or even just one friend if you knew they would do everything they possibly could to make sure they wouldn't let you down.
 It was entirely different when you weren't sure you could trust the people around you.
 Brandon was too good to be true.
 I pretty much expected any day now he'd come to his senses and realize he could do a lot better.
 Right or not, it's hard to really become emotionally invested when you feel like that.
 Rachel on the other hand should have been the perfect friend, but I got the feeling she'd always choose her brother over me.
 I felt guilty for holding that against her, family¬†should¬†be important.
 Cindi's friends back in Minnesota had probably felt similarly, but I'd always been really careful not to make her choose between me and them.

I had been born in a castle.

Near panic levels of concern rippled across the world during this period about rising levels of joblessness, prompting one doomsday author to prophesize the ‚Äòend of work‚Äô.
 The situation became particularly acute in developing countries, because of their predominately young populations and high population growth rates.
 Trends and Prospects
 ICPF refused to side with the pessimists who viewed unemployment as a terminal illness spreading rapidly through the entire world economic system.
 Its report presented evidence to dispel the twin myths that technological development and trade were net job destroyers.
 It traced the growth of employment opportunities through the 20th Century, a century of unprecedented technological development and commercial expansion, to show that this period has also been an era of unprecedented growth in the quantity and quality of employment opportunities.
 The report argued that the current surge in joblessness was a temporary result of the mismatch between the rates of surging population growth and expanding economic activity.
 It concurred that rising levels of unemployment constituted a serious problem that needed to be urgently addressed, but rejected the notion that it is an inevitable and incurable disease which the world must resign itself to passively suffer and endure.
 The Commission, therefore, developed and presented a comprehensive strategy for job-led economic growth.
 Over the past decade, changes in the employment picture lend credence to ICPF‚Äôs perspective.

 He approached the door to the tower roof with the prisoners.
 Instead of formulating a plan of action his mind kept going back to the horror of last week's practice when his master, Ravenhurr, demanded a rehearsal of the ritual ceremony with the senior guards.
 At the time he assumed they would merely walk through the procedure.
 Ravenhurr, however, was the kind of man who demanded perfection.
 He demanded it both in himself and from those around him.
 That perfection required no less than an exact replication of the ceremony.

At each crucial juncture either the central bank or the government pulled back from enforcing the necessary fiscal discipline.
 But it is equally true that ‚Äòshock therapy‚Äô never could have been implemented by a democratic government, when it imposed such enormous hardship on the people and generated a polarization and fragmentation of political forces within the country.
 Where similar strategies have succeeded in other parts of the world, it has usually been under authoritarian governments, such as in Chile.
 Where force is not possible, the only viable alternative is to build social consensus in support of the reform strategy.
 Ultimately, the success of the reform measures will be determined by one factor ‚Äì the extent to which the people understand, accept and are motivated to act under the new system.
 Before introducing any new measure, maximum effort should be made to communicate its purpose and nature to the people and win their understanding and approval.
 Public education is the most powerful policy instrument.
 With public opinion widely divided over the best course of action, it is necessary to win back the understanding, support and endorsement of the population for an alternative programme which the major parties and social groups can back.
 This requires educating the public to understand both the costs and benefits involved in any reform strategy, the trade-offs between immediate advantages and immediate sacrifices required to establish a new and stable equilibrium.
 3.Economic strategy must be balanced: A market economy can be introduced gradually or step-wise, but it cannot be introduced in a fragmentary or piecemeal manner.

Honest.
 Luke the horse breeder, I can admire, and Eric I can adore, in part because I know their flaws, their humanity.
 Luke's are exposed in "A Father's Story".
 Eric's I can remember, and for reminders, I have his report cards.
 Adoring a human may require us to have developed beyond pure selfishness.
 Yet once that's accomplished, the task seems to come naturally.
 But, at my level, even attempting to adore God is calling for plenty of effort.
 Which I'm beginning to see as the point of this trip I had thought was meant to sell books.
 Still, if God asks me to give up Zo√´, I'll fight him.

In the evenings they'd eat and talk and watch TV, but he promised to take her to the shore Saturday.
 "The first thing we have to do is buy you a bathing suit," Rick told Marie as they strolled through the mall after dinner Friday evening.
 "Be prepared, OK?
 I think you'll find them a little immodest."
 She tried to prepare herself, but she was shocked by the outfits she was shown.
 The material was thin, and they all had plunging necklines, and some were cut so that the edge of the leg hole was almost as high as the arm hole.
 But she managed to find two, one red and one black with pink flowers, that were less shocking than the others and took them to the dressing room.
 These weren't going to work.
 She'd chosen the two with the least amount of d√©colletage, and they still wouldn't work.

Scanning the text on the page opposite the picture, he found a little information about her.
 She‚Äôd gotten married at 23‚Äîa year after the picture had been taken.
 And she‚Äôd died in 1941.
 So young!
 She‚Äôd been only 37.
 Wondering what she‚Äôd died of, he turned the page and found more information about her.
 "Jefferson Tranton handpicked Davis Runyon, heir to the Runyon publishing empire, as a husband for his daughter.
 Chandler Runyon had sold the business when his son was 19 years old so that, in actuality, Davis Runyon was heir only to the family fortune and to the power of wealth, not to the power of position.
 Eager for such, he courted both the young woman and her father.
 Tranton and his son had had a falling out when the younger Tranton had begun his own company in 1925, and because he had disinherited his son, Tranton began grooming Runyon to run his company as well as to become his son-in-law.

Her eyes flicked back to me.
 ‚ÄúIt was very fortunate for me she‚Äôd kept a journal, you see, for I would have no fairy knowledge without it.‚Äù I felt my brows draw together and tried to smooth my face.

 Not that she‚Äôd given me much opportunity.
 I contemplated whether this was her usual behavior toward strangers or if she felt we had a special motherless bond.
 She ran her finger through the substance in the canister and it came out coated in a deep, dark green that had the consistency of grease, which she smeared across the base of my eyelid.
 She continued rambling as she coated various parts of my body with lotions and powders, smoothed my hair with a sweet-scented cream, painted my lips with a soft balm that smelled of spice.
 After she ran out of areas to work with, she opened a tall glass container with black liquid inside and dipped a cut braid of hair into the bottle.
 She drew it out, using the tip to brush an intricate design on the inside of my wrist.

Chevelle nodded toward the hut as he prepared a fire, and I found my pack on a bed of birch branches, along with a pile of dry clothes.
 As I tugged off my soaked pants to exchange them for the new ones, I wondered if Chevelle had brought both sets or if they‚Äôd been packed by Junnie in that small, strange village.
 I couldn‚Äôt fathom why I hadn‚Äôt considered he‚Äôd so easily be able to follow me when I‚Äôd run from there, how I‚Äôd been oblivious to the dangers of being caught.
 The shirt was fitted to my shape but of a heavier fabric, and a pair of boots was at the bottom of the stack; it must be much colder in the mountains.
 It reminded me of stepping out of the cold wet gown on the bank of the creek, finding the scroll, the map.
 Chevelle‚Äôs words echoed in my mind.

 "You could leave your dress and go back in your bathing suit."

The teeth were not the sore, crooked teeth that he had had to be so careful to chew with this morning.
 They were now strong and straight.
 His balding head was now covered in thick long curls, too beautiful for a man in his opinion.
 Rodregas would cut the hair short when he had a chance.
 Ravenhurr had looked for the most perfect physical specimen that he could find and Rodregas was now him.
 Over the years Ravenhurr had ‚Äúcollected‚Äù many very gifted young men.
 These men had won athletic contests and were known for their incredible physical gifts, good looks and sharp wits.
 Ravenhurr tested them for strength, reflexes and dexterity.
 Those that succeeded were further tested for the sharpness of their senses, their intelligence and ability to learn new languages.

 "Brandon's lies are so convincing precisely because he's so careful to mix a healthy serving of truth in there to go along with the false.
 She's liked Ben for almost as long as I can remember.
 I think it all started when they both ended up at the school nurse together with broken bones due to 'falling down the stairs.'"
 I felt a shiver course through me at the thought of what Rachel was implying.
 Watching Jasmin twirl through moves that seemed to be a modification of East Coast Swing, it was hard to believe anyone so self-possessed could've had that kind of childhood.
 I thought about asking for more details, but it felt wrong, like reading someone else's e-mail.

It'd become nearly pass√© to wake up emotionally exhausted from what should have been a restful night, but these dreams had been different.
 I'd played out nearly every possible combination of events since the accident.
 Dreams where I was the one driving instead of Cindi.
 Dreams where I got a ride home with someone so Dad and Cindi didn't have any reason to be on the road.
 Dreams where I was in the truck that killed them, even dreams where I was in the back seat as a passenger at the moment of impact.
 I was used to awaking shaking and scared countless times during the course of a night, but I'd never felt that level of pure, bestial fear.
 I stumbled into the bathroom and flipped on the light, only to groan at how ghastly I looked.
 I was even paler than normal, with dark circles under my eyes that only a crack addict could possibly find attractive.
 A hot shower did a little to make me more presentable, I tried to hide the shadows with some makeup, and then finally gave up after botching the second application, and just put on some mascara and eyeliner.
 The mundane process of getting ready for the day wore away some of the edge to my nightmare.

"I'm glad you feel the same.
 You'd think they'd be a little more welcoming.
 Instead it's like they go out of their way to make sure you know you don't really fit in.
 We've been here a year, and I still can't get invited to any of the really cool parties."
 I'd never been invited to any parties, let alone cool ones.
 I'd never felt the lack too strongly, but I smiled and let Britney keep talking until Mr. Whethers realized it was time to start class.
 I quickly gathered we'd be reading Wuthering Heights, a prospect that both elated and disappointed me.
 After seeing how far behind I was already in Biology, it was nice to know we'd be working on something I'd already been through twice.
 On the other hand I hadn't liked the novel the first time I'd read it, and when I'd gritted my teeth and sat down for a second attempt I'd found I liked it even less.
 Maybe I just lacked the maturity to appreciate Bronte's so-called masterpiece, but I couldn't stand that her characters were almost all really nasty people.

y bad reason, it was just that I didn't like them all that much. I liked how they were92m written0m, but I didn't like how they acted. I didn't like how92m they0m managed or did certain things.

The role of UN peace-keeping forces has been expanded dramatically in recent years to maintain peace in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
 At the same time, the scope of its activities has been enlarged to include limited forms of peace making as well ‚Äì disarming guerrillas, conducting elections and enforcing human rights.
 Article 42 of the UN Charter also empowers the Security Council to take direct military action where necessary to maintain or restore peace and guarantee international security.
 Article 43 pledges member states to make armed forces available to the Security Council, not only on an ad hoc basis but also as a permanent standing military force.
 This provision has never been activated due to the intervention of the Cold War.
 In the wake of the invasion of Kuwait, a proposal was placed before the UN General Assembly on behalf of a group of small and militarily weak nations seeking the protection of an international ‚Äòsecurity umbrella‚Äô against the threat of invasion by mercenary forces, terrorists, drug traffickers and warlike neighbours.
 The proposal was supported unanimously by the UN‚Äôs 166 member states.
 In Agenda for Peace, the UN Secretary General has recommended broadening the peace-making, peace-keeping and peace-enforcing capabilities of the UN by establishing a standing UN military force.
 With the end of bipolar confrontation within the Security Council, this proposal is practicable and should be acted upon immediately by establishing a strong permanent force drawn from 20 to 30 member states, trained and equipped for rapid deployment.
 Such a force, if established, is likely to be relatively small, however, and unequal to the task of dealing with threats from a major army equipped with sophisticated weapons.

A coldly rational part of me knew that however this ended up playing out, I'd still have a test on Monday, and I'd still want to pass.
 It'd be nice sometimes to make the kind of dramatic gesture that you see on movies, or read about in books.
 Instead, I was sitting here with a stupid textbook while everything else inside of me hurt in a funny, cold kind of way.
 Like it hurt so much I could only feel the edges of the pain.
 Spanish followed Biology; then other subjects came and went until I felt like I'd made enough progress, or possibly wasted enough time.
 I collapsed into bed hours early and slept poorly.
 Sunday was about the same, only my insides felt even rawer under the calm surface.
 Like maybe they'd had something caustic poured on them.
 I woodenly went through the motions of studying, and then finally pushed all of my books to the side and opened up Les Mis√©rables.
 I tried to lose myself in the book, but the same worries that'd pestered me while I was trying to study continued to grate against the back of my mind.

After her walk through the garden, Rick wanted to go back to bed for a while, but she begged him to leave right away.
 Excitedly she put on her bathing suit, glad that there was no full-length mirror in her room.
 Rick had assured her that her bathing suit was very modest for 2011, but she still felt apprehensive as she stepped into the hall.
 "Rick!

 "Just a second."
 He came out moments later in shorts and a shirt.
 "You're not ready!"

Chapter 20: Going Down Finally a red Dodge Charger is driving slowly over the entrance bridge.
 I say, ‚ÄúRed Dodge Charger approaching at one o‚Äôclock,‚Äù attempting not to move my lips, as the vehicle is coming almost directly towards me on my right.
 The Dodge slows almost to a stop just a couple of car lengths away.
 I am unable to see in the tinted windows of the car but I am certain they can see me; I stare back as if to say, ‚ÄúIs that you?‚Äù They are obviously aware that I am there, alone and awaiting their arrival.
 The car slowly pulls away after taking a good look at me.
 I lose sight of them, as they seem to be going towards the opposite end of the parking lot.
 I assume they will pull around after checking out the surroundings but instead my crack-berry rings within seconds.
 It is Ashley and she is trying to move me to a Starbucks that is on the other side of the same parking lot.
 I resist and ask her if that was her that stopped next to me in the red Dodge Charger.
 She says it was but she would rather meet at the Starbucks where there are some people around.

All I could think of was the young children in the village, binding themselves to play the games of fairy children, who were unmagical until coming of age.
 I recalled seeing it in the documents in the briar patch‚ÄîFrancine Glaforia, bound against using all but practical magic.
 Bound.
 They must have known not to trust me.

Sometimes the intimacy of living with her was a strain--sleeping and showering under the same roof, shopping for underwear and doing laundry, lazy evenings when he held her close.
 She was beautiful and sexy, and he ached to kiss and caress her and make love to her.
 But he cared about her too much to press her.
 "Marie!"
 he called when he got home that afternoon.
 "I'll be down in a minute!"
 He went to the kitchen and set the pizza on the table.
 As he was filling glasses with ice, she padded into the kitchen.

Unfortunately, it's now too late for you to switch into another class.
 I'm afraid you'll just have to take the failing grade."
 I stood there woodenly for several seconds, unsure whether or not she was through.
 She finally made a shooing motion and turned back to grading papers.
 Predictably, there were still a half-dozen other kids in the classroom.
 They all turned back to the door and started filing out again, but by tomorrow half the school would know exactly how badly I'd just been humiliated.
 I found myself just outside the tutor lab with no recollection of having stumbled to my locker, or going by Physics to grab the stuff I'd left there.
 Still, somehow my Spanish book had disappeared, replaced by my math book.

Imeralda thought that Rodregas was only marginally better.

 But he was also breathing deeply and through the bond she knew he was trying to control himself.
 Imeralda saw that Rodregas was also watching Doi‚Äôvan.
 She thought he also recognized the danger of a Hellborn rage.
 Imeralda reached out to Rodregas first to try to get him to calm down and help manage Doi‚Äôvan.
 Imeralda focused on their bond and looked him in the eyes and said, ‚ÄúRodregas getting angry will not change things, let‚Äôs sit down and talk to the village elders.

He had dinner with her family two or three times a week, but he and her father always retired to her father's study for the rest of the evening.
 And they'd only gone out alone twice.
 Considering the pattern of the past five weeks, Marie was thrilled when Davis told her that he was taking her out to dinner the next Friday evening.
 But it turned out to be completely unlike the night of their betrothal.
 Davis was in an abominable mood, complaining about the food, the service, even the color of the tablecloth.
 And he was too tired to go dancing after dinner.

Over the years Ravenhurr had ‚Äúcollected‚Äù many very gifted young men.
 These men had won athletic contests and were known for their incredible physical gifts, good looks and sharp wits.
 Ravenhurr tested them for strength, reflexes and dexterity.
 Those that succeeded were further tested for the sharpness of their senses, their intelligence and ability to learn new languages.
 The winner of these tests was rewarded with having his soul and mind ripped out and made into a piece of meat to be filled with the mind, personality, and the very soul of Ravenhurr himself.
 However, this time, instead of Ravenhurr, his old guard sergeant had ended up as a new powerful Immortalist.
 As the cold of the stone chilled his back Rodregas thought about his promise to the Celestial Gods that if he were able to kill Ravenhurr and live, then his new duty would be to fight the Immortalists.
 When all and everyone else had failed him over the years, only his duty had kept Rodregas alive.
 He no longer knew what to do without it.

 Maybe he'd seen how awkward I was, but didn't mind.
 Maybe he even thought it was endearing.
 Failing that, I at least hoped he wasn't chuckling with his friends over the new girl's stupid infatuation.
 He wasn't doing either, in fact, he seemed to be very much involved in a conversation with the stocky boy on his right.
 The rest of the kids at the table were listening just as intensely, all except for the brunette on Brandon's left who was looking in our direction.
 My face pulled back in a smile, I even brought my hand partway up in a wave before I realized I recognized her.
 It was the trendy girl from the office, and she apparently still didn't like me.

 I was alone in her bed, but could hear an exchange of low whispers from the open door as she and Steed conversed in the front room.
 I wasn‚Äôt about to announce I had woken.
 My head didn‚Äôt throb as before, no sour mouth.
 It was overall a much better experience.
 But who could stand the dreams?
 I rolled to my side, rubbing the sleep from my face.
 There were a few books on the bedside table and I reached over to draw the top one near.
 I flipped idly through the pages, until I recognized it was detailing the different aspects of magic.

"We're not going to spend our last hours together doing dishes."
 She swallowed, running her hands over his t-shirt.
 "I wish I had something from 1927 to give you."
 He stroked her hair.
 "You could leave your dress and go back in your bathing suit."
 She smiled.
 "I'll have enough to explain as it is."
 Inspired by the way he was toying with her hair, she asked, "Would you like to have a lock of my hair?"
 "That's a great idea."
 He bent to inhale its fragrance.

And until you do, I'll take care of you.

 She went upstairs with him and said goodnight outside her bedroom door.
 But her heart began pounding with panic as she thought about the day she'd just spent in 2011.
 She'd worn trousers in town, and she'd embraced a man in public.
 And now she was spending the night alone with him in his house!
 Davis would have a fit if he ever found out she'd been to a speakeasy; he'd refuse to marry her if he found out what she'd done today.
 But there was no way he could find out.
 Tomorrow she'd be back home, and he'd be ecstatic that she was all right.
 He'd be sorry he'd lost his temper with her and hurt her with his kiss.

After passing out during the movie at the birthing class, (yes, really!)
 I was not convinced I was going to be the pillar of strength my wife would need during the birth of our child (and neither was Lisa).
 I remember the movie; it was titled ‚ÄúThe Brazilian Squatting Method.‚Äù Until then, The Exorcist was the scariest movie I had ever seen, and this beat it hands down.
 I excused myself from the room‚Äîwhich was filled with couples huddled together on little mats on the ground‚Äîas I began to pass out.
 I headed down the hall towards the men‚Äôs restroom and I felt myself weakening with every step.
 I pushed on the door and then the next thing I knew, I was waking up on the floor with the restroom door against my side, propping it open like a bag of sand, half of my body in the restroom and half out in the hall.
 After splashing some water in my face I returned as if nothing had happened, but I knew and I suspected that Lisa did too.
 Shortly thereafter, we entered the hospital in first time frantic labor.
 We were calmly directed to the ‚Äúbirthing room.‚Äù There was no turning back.
 There is no way to describe this to anyone who has not witnessed a birth.

I felt every step, holding tight as the horse‚Äôs hooves slipped and jumped.
 The haze thickened, keeping the view both ahead and behind close.
 It gathered in my hair, leaving it a matted mess with the single braid‚ÄîRuby‚Äôs handiwork‚Äîdripping condensation over the shoulder of my cloak.
 I decided to practice as we rode, closing my eyes to sink partially into my horse, still alert to my own self and the outside world.
 It was there, leading my horse and seeing through his eyes, that the pain struck.
 It came on instantaneously, hitting me like a blade, cutting, shearing.
 It was accompanied by sharpness of sound as well.
 My ears were in excruciating pain.
 The horse dropped, his head smacked to the ground and I watched through his eyes as he hit.
 The animal‚Äôs senses stilled, not panicked as my own.

His life was more boring than anything else.
 He approached the door to the tower roof with the prisoners.
 Instead of formulating a plan of action his mind kept going back to the horror of last week's practice when his master, Ravenhurr, demanded a rehearsal of the ritual ceremony with the senior guards.
 At the time he assumed they would merely walk through the procedure.
 Ravenhurr, however, was the kind of man who demanded perfection.
 He demanded it both in himself and from those around him.
 That perfection required no less than an exact replication of the ceremony.
 As usual, he acceded to his master's wishes and did as he was told.
 He knew the value of following orders and it had kept him alive so far.
 When he placed his hand on the tower door an involuntary shudder racked his body at the idea of following those orders one more time.

"Good, I need to start tracking your movements so you don't keep running me over."
 The rest of lunch and all of history passed in a blur.
 My mind kept returning to Brandon, and the question of why he was taking such an interest in me.
 It wasn't until I'd returned Mrs. Alexander's reference book to its shelf and sat down at my desk that I remembered I'd had to do the entire 'group' project by myself.
 Alec hadn't even bothered to come to Physics since the assignment had been given.
 My entire life I'd had people try and sponge off of my work, and I was way beyond sick and tired of it.
 By the time Alec strode into class looking like the inspiration for every romance novel ever written, I was really mad.
 I hardly waited for him to sit down before I pulled my desk a little closer and hissed at him.
 "So very nice of you to come to class on the day our stupid assignment is due."
 Alec's expression was remarkable in that I'd never seen anyone look so full of life while simultaneously failing to betray even the slightest hint of emotion.

A few humans stuck their heads out their doors to glimpse the armored men trampling through their city.

I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be easy because as it turns out she knew of me through high school and my reputation preceded me.
 Would this ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù give her number to a ‚Äúbad boy?‚Äù The ploy worked and somehow Lisa agreed to let me call her.
 Lisa had been dating a guy for years and I knew of him.
 He had attended our high school and he was the quarterback of the football team (my polar opposite).
 She had only come to the club the night I met her because she was angry with her boyfriend because he choose to spend Valentine‚Äôs Day with his brother playing basketball (take notes boys).
 She had called a friend who told her she could get her into this bar because she knew the bartender and they were both under legal drinking age.
 Lisa was 20.
 She was a ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù and hadn‚Äôt ever done anything like that.
 She had no intention of breaking up with her boyfriend.

 Doi‚Äôvan led the three deeper into the great cathedral and said, ‚ÄúSir Rodregas, congratulations are in order for becoming a Knight of the Soaring Heavens, but I fear Van‚Äôdret is getting suspicious.
 You now have the right to enter the Chamber that holds the greater sigils.

 ‚ÄúCan I bring you two into the Chamber as my advisors?‚Äù ‚ÄúThat does seem to be allowed,‚Äù said Imeralda, ‚ÄúTraditionally that is more about fathers with sons, not half bloods and Hellborns, but I think we might have a bigger problem.‚Äù She stopped speaking mid sentence, and Rodregas curiously looked back at her, but she was staring ahead.
 A figure stood there tall and graceful.
 He had appeared out of nowhere, as if by magic.
 It was Van‚Äôdret.
 ‚ÄúAh, I see the three of you are all together and far away from the others, how convenient for me.‚Äù Van‚Äôdret casually reached out toward the side wall and they could vaguely hear him mumble a few words.

When we rely on the inner resources, we achieve the maximum because we are constantly led to discover more of our own unlimited capacities.
 Why should we wait before acting until we are compelled by the irresistible force of the rising expectations of the world‚Äôs masses, by the explosion of violence in our cities, or by the complete breakdown of our economic systems because of spiralling unemployment?
 Why should we not act now to prevent these outcomes and reverse the trends that threaten to make them a reality?
 All the resources necessary are within our reach, within ourselves.
 We need the courage to think and say that it is time to abolish weapons of mass destruction and call a halt to the use of war for settlement of disputes, that it is time to insist that all people enjoy the most basic democratic freedoms, that there can and must be enough food produced to feed everyone, and that every person must be guaranteed the right to gainful employment.
 The barriers to these achievements are not material or technological.
 It takes money, materials and technology to make war, not to stop it.
 That requires a determination and insistence, an intolerance of violence, which must start with a commitment of the world‚Äôs leaders and the total empowerment of the UN to enforce peace.
 It takes material resources and technology to suppress people, not to make them free.
 That requires an acceptance of basic human rights as a non-negotiable minimum requirement for each nation to participate in the international community, which must start with a voluntary abdication by the great powers of the principle of rule by might that governs the present structure of the UN.

 I expected her to argue with him.
 No girl on the planet liked it when her older brother sided with her friends against her, but Rachel just frowned a little before scooting back so she could do up her seatbelt.
 Was she really that scared of him?
 I stole a glance at him out of the corner of my eye.
 He didn't look threatening, well, at least no more so than usual.
 Anyone with that many muscles was at least a little threatening.

During the interrogation, which included the usual scare tactics, the cops showed him a great deal of information they had collected on him.
 Even though they didn‚Äôt have the bust they wanted, they had him verbally agreeing to provide drugs and several people willing to testify that Brandon had provided them with Oxy and other drugs.
 They had been monitoring him for some time and had ample surveillance to make up for the lack of drugs at his actual bust.
 Brandon had been dealing Oxy for the past few years and the police had been looking to get him.
 Brandon had at one time been moving thousands of these tiny green prescription pain pills through California, making nighttime drives to Los Angeles and back to buy huge quantities to supply the Sacramento area.
 They were charging him with three felonies and he was facing five plus years in prison.
 Faced with the charges, Brandon waved his attorney rights and talked too much‚Äî a strung out drug addict who just got popped.
 The interrogation lasted nearly twenty hours; although, to Brandon, it felt like three days.
 Faced with the abundance of evidence and the thought of five years in prison, Brandon broke and agreed to bust a dealer named Steve.
 The interesting thing about Steve was that much of the information the officers had on Brandon was from Steve.

It was not easy living on my own and finding roommates at such a young age, but I managed.
 After a short stint of crashing on couches or extra bedrooms of several friends, I rented a room at a house with some other kids near my age.
 I was still in high school and I wanted to graduate, but I also needed money to live on.
 Rent, food, utilities and various expenses were all new to me.
 The father of my girlfriend Lori was an executive of a supermarket chain, and he made some calls and got me an interview.
 The manager explained to me that he would love to hire me but he had a hiring freeze on everyone but minorities.
 I had no idea what this meant so I asked, and he explained to me all the types of minorities that he could hire, including, American Indian.
 I said, ‚ÄúHey, my grandfather was half American Indian,‚Äù and he hired me on the spot.
 I have never used my heritage in any way since that day.
 It felt wrong to me that because of my ancestry I could be hired, but I needed a job and this one paid well.

 Like maybe he was going to argue, but as he opened his mouth Rachel turned and glared at him.
 It seemed odd to see someone only a little smaller than Alec back away from someone even smaller than me.
 The image stuck with me so strongly that I considered it until Rachel came over and took my hand.
 "What's wrong?
 It's just the two of us now, you don't have to worry about James, and I won't tell anyone else.
 I swear."

Nobody has ever discovered a wormhole, and none of this stuff has ever been proven."
 Marie sighed.
 "This book isn't hard to follow, but I'm rather skeptical.
 The author says that thought is the way to travel through time.
 He says that if you concentrate hard enough on getting to the time you want to visit, you can do it."
 "Yeah, I found some ideas about that in the other books I read.
 Maybe--" "But that doesn't explain how I came here.

It all seemed so impossible, legends brought to life and paraded before my incredulous eyes, and yet there was no arguing with the truth.
 It was starting to sink in that I needed to come to terms with all of the natural implications.
 Things like the fact that some or all of my attraction to Alec was based on his ability to addict humans to him, intentionally or not.
 James and Jessica were squared off against Alec now while Isaac and Jasmin watched.
 I'd thought everyone else moved fast, but Alec was even faster.
 He actually dodged Jess' jump, causing her to latch onto nothing more than thin air, while he spun around and hit James with a blow to the chest that had to have broken ribs.
 "Alec's a good leader.
 Maybe the best.
 This kind of exercise would be impossible in nearly any other pack, but it's the only thing that's kept us alive in the face of Brandon's larger pack."
 I didn't want her to say anything she wasn't supposed to, especially not if Alec was having as hard of a time controlling the anger that seemed to be part and parcel of the new shapes everyone was wearing, but I was desperate to start understanding some of what was going on.

Of course, I'm sure that once she's married, she'll settle down and realize that life isn't like those picture shows and books that fill her mind with wild ideas."
 "I'm sure you're right, sir."
 Davis had no intention of letting her get away with the things her father did.
 Of course, she had the old man fooled, but Davis wasn't so easily deceived.
 Marie could tell that something was in the air that day.
 Her father and Davis kept exchanging looks over lunch, and they didn't shoo her and her mother from the table right after lunch so that they could discuss business.
 She suspected that Davis had something special planned for that evening, and when she caught her mother's glance over their teacups, she knew right away that her mother shared her suspicions.
 He took her to a French restaurant in the Back Bay, not far from her house.

Under a market system, millions of small producers and consumers must be free to buy or sell wherever the price is most attractive.
 This requires a vast proliferation of small goods transporters in the private sector, which are rare in many countries today.
 The large freight transport monopolies have to be replaced by entrepreneurial companies with small fleets competing for freight business.
 Immediate steps are needed to expand capacity and introduce competition in this vital sector by promoting the development of private road transport companies at the national, regional and local level.
 Special loan and leasing programmes should be established to enable small firms and individuals to purchase vehicles and pay for them out of the revenues generated from use.
 6.Regional models and pilot programmes: Pioneering initiatives need to be encouraged to act as demonstrations and catalysts for new types of activities in the country.
 In a region as vast and diverse as this and in countries such as Russia, which extends over eleven time zones, no single model or pattern will be widely applicable.
 Therefore, several areas in each country representing different economic and social conditions should be selected for establishment of model transition programmes.
 In each area, a study should be conducted of resources and economic potentials, existing institutions and infrastructure, current levels of skill and social attitudes regarding the market system.
 Detailed strategies should be devised to educate the public about untapped opportunities, strengthen the institutional infrastructure, impart needed skills, establish catalytic demonstrations and encourage multiplication of successful new activities.

opment. The national model transition programme should be designed for a particular region and for a specific sector. The92m regional0m model transition programme should be designed for another area with92m similar0m economic conditions.

Much as I'd have liked to, I couldn't continue to blow her off.
 She was my only friend, and I definitely didn't want her spreading the kind of rumors about me that she routinely spread about everyone else.
 "Wow, you look like crap.
 Are you going to collapse like you did last night?"
 "Thanks, Brit.
 You look ravishing too, and no, I'm not going to collapse.

But he did not look directly into my eyes as before.
 It bothered me, and I didn‚Äôt think it was because of my conscience.
 When he reached the end of the book, it returned to its home on the shelf and he stood, placing a hand briefly on the top of my head.
 It was only a momentary touch, but electricity surged though me.
 A flash of confusion or frustration passed over his features, too fast to identify.
 He looked into my eyes one last time as I sat, stunned and speechless, my skin still tingling from the contact.
 ‚ÄúEnough for today,‚Äù he said, nodding as he turned, his long strides taking him too quick from my view.
 I sat motionless as I watched him go, and remained so for some time after.
 I hadn‚Äôt realized how exhausted I‚Äôd been.
 When I finally rose to leave, I stashed a few more of the northern clan documents from the table under my shirt.

 She smiled.

 He hugged her again.

I looked over at the exterior wall of the school and felt my jaw drop.
 Maybe Mom had read the story about the three little pigs a few too many times to me when I was growing up, but I'd always thought of brick as the strongest possible building material.
 I didn't have any idea if it really was, but it seemed incredible that anything could've wreaked such damage.
 The bricks on the wall next to the door were cracked and set back in the wall, almost like they'd been hit with some kind of wrecking ball, and the concrete of the sidewalk had gouges crisscrossing its surface like some kind of abstract painting.
 "There's nothing to see here, kids.
 I want you to all disperse and go to your home rooms."
 The short, mostly bald man who'd ordered us all to leave was just visible through a gap in the crowd.

He looked about sixteen.
 His haircut might have come from a Marine base.
 He wore glasses and a smile I interpreted as phony.
 He passed out a Bible tract, a directory of churches, and a card with his name and phone number.

 This kid, I believed, had spent more time in church than outside in the real world.
 He hadn‚Äôt attended a dozen funerals, known anyone like Eric, read Nietzsche or Dostoyevski.
 Most of all, he wasn‚Äôt Billy Graham.

But until our sport came into season and we officially made the teams, we got denied privileges afforded to athletes, like assigned gym lockers.
 Since Eric still wanted to work out and wouldn‚Äôt face the world without a shower afterward, Cliff invited him to share his locker.
 Besides running the mile during track season, Cliff was second man on the cross-country team, behind Gary Hafner.
 Eric used the locker for a couple weeks before Coach Gory summoned Cliff to his office, sat him down, and asked him to explain why a new sweat suit just issued to Gary Hafner had turned up missing and gotten found in Cliff‚Äôs locker.
 Cliff maintained that he‚Äôd never even seen the sweat suit.
 ‚ÄúIt looks like Eric stole them,‚Äù Coach said.
 ‚ÄúEric doesn‚Äôt steal,‚Äù Cliff said adamantly.
 Still, when Coach Gory dropped Cliff from the cross-country and track teams, he got afflicted with anger and confusion, wondering if Eric might‚Äôve been the thief after all.

As he had stepped closer to punch, the gem at the end had shimmered a soft green.
 ‚ÄúOf all the dumb luck,‚Äù he said, a grin spreading across his face.

 Harruq held an arm defensively in front of Qurrah, his eyes darting in all directions.

See that coming and, walloped by dread reality, spooked beyond reach of old customs and authority, our nature cries, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs out there somewhere, whatever it is.
 Go find it.‚Äù Eric and I bought Kerouac‚Äôs On the Road, and checked out Dharma Bums and his latest, Big Sur, a memoir in minimal disguise, about a fellow who goes to a cabin in the forest to recover from drunkenness and fame.
 Imagine Henry David Thoreau as a neurotic who returns to Walden Pond and finds psychosis awaiting him there.
 Still, we concluded that a poet of Kerouac's passion and skill, who could make a hangover feel romantic, would pull out of his tailspin and rise again.
 That fall, Eric and I read most every day, then sat in my backyard or on a beach or sea cliff and talked for hours at a spell.
 Also, we worked at odd jobs, sold some possessions, and saved most of whatever our moms gave us.
 We needed gas money, so we could chase visions of Kerouac and his Beat pals through the places they haunted at the west end of their cross-country odysseys.
 Twice that fall, the minute school let out on Friday, we sped north on Highway 101.
 From Morro Bay to Santa Cruz, we followed the coast and made camp for the night on a cliff between Hearst Castle and Big Sur.

 I must really repulse him.
 Physics was my own little personal hell for the next forty minutes.
 I absorbed absolutely nothing from the rest of the discussion about calculating mechanical advantage, and when we were finally released into our groups Alec and I didn't even look each other in the eyes.
 I gutted out the last five minutes by pretending I was completely absorbed in a reference book while Alec started running preliminary calculations.
 He was out of his seat and halfway to the door by the time I'd even realized the bell had rung to dismiss us.
 Spanish was both better and worse.
 Better because without Alec sitting six feet away from me I was able to think about something other than him, worse because we had a pop quiz and I barely placed in the A- range despite having spent a fair amount of time on my vocabulary.

She finally made a shooing motion and turned back to grading papers.
 Predictably, there were still a half-dozen other kids in the classroom.
 They all turned back to the door and started filing out again, but by tomorrow half the school would know exactly how badly I'd just been humiliated.
 I found myself just outside the tutor lab with no recollection of having stumbled to my locker, or going by Physics to grab the stuff I'd left there.
 Still, somehow my Spanish book had disappeared, replaced by my math book.
 My knees started shaking as I entered the room, but I made it safely to my normal table before they gave out.
 "Adri, Adriana?
 Excuse me."
 I didn't recognize the girl standing across from me, but based on her uncomfortable expression and the fact that more than one person had turned for the sole purpose of watching us out of the corner of their eyes, she'd been standing there longer than I'd realized.

He no longer knew what to do without it.
 His back straightened and he pulled away from the wall that he had slumped against.
 Rodregas lived instead of the man whose body he now lived in.
 He had seen the tragedy of gifted person after gifted person be torn asunder by the Immortalists.
 He hated the Immortalists for their casual destruction and use of people.
 Could he now live in one of these stolen bodies, unless he had a reason?
 The Immortalists and their Guild were evil and needed to be opposed.

It's like, oh, I don't know, I think maybe learning about the past will help me understand what's going on right now."
 Mallory's sigh seemed to allude to every one of her presumably substantial years.
 "How very perceptive.
 The past is very much driving what's happening right now, but so much of the past is tied up with the very things from which Alec's trying to protect you."
 I was bubbling with questions, but sensing that now wasn't the time to push, I sat back and waited in silence while she decided exactly how much to tell me.
 "Alec's father was killed nearly two decades ago.
 I don't remember everything about that night, I wasn't even conscious for a large part of the happenings, but the pieces I do remember are sharper than they should be.
 Sharper in my mind now maybe than even when they happened."
 Her hand gripped mine with a fragile strength that hinted at the vibrant, powerful woman she'd been back then.

My dreams were wicked that night, all venom and wolves, snakes and beasts, death and fire.
 I woke in my bed, light filtering in through the window.
 The door was open a crack and I could see Chevelle sitting in the front room.
 I was hesitant to face him.
 I lay there, running back through the events of the night, the stories.
 Embarrassment flooded me again and I turned my head to bury it in the blankets, but something strange on the side table caught my attention.

This was so far out of our realm of understanding and far from our abilities to negotiate.
 A maze of tangled claims and questionable results.
 Brandon also needed to be available to the narcotics officers to fulfill his end of a bargain he had struck with them during his brief incarceration.
 We decided to try to detox him as long as it took for him to get his arrangement with the narcotics officers completed, and then we would continue to find a state run program to admit him or reach our hands out to our family, who until now had primarily been kept in the dark.
 We were desperate for professional help.

 He was supposed to bring drugs to a hotel room, but because Brandon owed everybody money, his credit to be fronted drugs was not good, so he went to the drug deal without the drugs, planning to get the money first then go back for them.

I started to bristle; I even took a breath to explain what'd really happened.
 Only the truth wasn't any better than the story he'd fabricated.
 It was worse even.
 I'd much rather this cocky, spoiled, rich boy be mad at me than feel pity.
 I'd had enough pity from my mom to last years.
 "You bet.
 Think they bought it?"
 I tried to inject the proper amount of blonde stupidity into my words, but wasn't sure it worked until I felt Alec's arms tighten almost painfully around me.
 I gasped, and he set me down so quickly I almost fell over.
 Before I'd even regained my balance, he was walking away, moving so quickly I would've needed to run to keep up.

If he could take such joy in the creation process, maybe he wasn't as bad as he seemed.

 "Sure, I'd love to.

 I ignored the spate of nasty looks shot my way, gathered my books, accepted the bundle of papers, and hurried off to the stairs.
 It was later than last time, so unless I was quick the bell was going to ring before I made it back down the stairs.
 The congestion was bad in the halls, but for some reason it was twice as bad around stairs.
 Apparently I was hurrying just a little too fast.
 I tripped just before I hit the first step, and almost went crashing down the flight that led to the basement.
 Luckily I was just quick enough to grab the banister and save myself from a broken neck.

Someone was carrying me.
 The horror must have stretched time, making the few seconds seem like minutes.
 I struggled to bring myself back.
 I could hear nothing but a piercing squall.
 I willed my eyes open, though only a fraction.
 I was looking at the back of a horse from my position slung over someone‚Äôs shoulder.
 My eyes closed once more as the pain doubled and I lost my body for a moment.
 I concentrated until I got it back and then realized I was bouncing.
 I worked my eyes again, using every ounce of control I had left.

Suffice it to say only Dominic has a greater capacity for empathy."
 I wanted to ask what Alec meant, but it was more and more obvious he wasn't going to answer anything he didn't want to.
 We walked in comfortable silence for several minutes before turning off into what I could only assume was the Lilac Room.
 Donovan looked up as we entered the suite.
 "I trust your mother was well, sir?"
 Alec nodded, a short choppy motion that eloquently conveyed his desire not to discuss the matter.
 He turned towards me, only to break off as a cell phone rang.
 "It's for you, probably your mom.
 Pretend you're home, I'll explain once you're finished."
 I almost dropped the phone, and probably wouldn't have managed to figure out how to answer the call in time if he hadn't reached over and pushed the green button for me.

 "Then don't ask them.

 Both fists were knotted now, and unless I was very much mistaken, there was just the barest hint of a shake there as well.
 "Don't be ridiculous, Adri.

 I can't let you expose yourself to the kinds of things Vincent or Brandon would...it's out of the question."

 When she was less happy with me, she tended to focus more on just how stubborn I could be.

That car started for the first time since I had taught the boys to drive, and Brandon missed this moment because drugs were now more important to him than anything or anybody.
 I looked at photos of Brandon growing up and wondered if I would view them in a slideshow at his funeral.
 My marriage suffered because Lisa defended Brandon vehemently; I completely understood, because I had grown up with a similar scenario: my mother‚Äôs unwillingness to see Thomas‚Äôs problem.
 My wife and I had many confrontations, and while we both knew he had a problem we disagreed on the severity and the solution.
 Soon, Brandon moved in with his girlfriend, Tiffanie, and she was as strung out as he was.
 When they were together, they looked like two skeletons embracing.
 They had grown fuzzy around their edges; it‚Äôs difficult to describe how they clung to each other in a desperate way as if they didn‚Äôt know where one ended and the other began.
 It was more than teenage passion driving them to that; it was dependence, an unhealthy co-dependence.
 They couldn‚Äôt meet anyone‚Äôs eyes; their pinpoint pupils darted around the room when I spoke to them.
 They couldn‚Äôt answer simple questions coherently.

 Even the feeling of him caressing my check again wasn't enough to bring me all the way back to full alertness.

 Little by little I started to realize just how empty my life really was.
 I wish I could come right out and say it while you're awake.
 I don't want that life anymore.
 I don't really want any life that doesn't involve you."
 Part of me wanted to scream for joy, to jump up out of my bed and wrap myself around Alec as tightly as I could, but I was just too far gone.
 I half thought I was dreaming it all.
 As I finally let sleep pull me down into darkness, I almost thought I heard Alec say one last thing.

Harruq nodded.

 Harruq mumbled another curse, his pulse racing.
 It wouldn‚Äôt take long to down the closer soldier, provided the archer wasn‚Äôt too good a shot.
 Even then, he risked at least two arrows sticking in his flesh.
 Unsure of what to do, he played dumb and let the first soldier approach.

Every hair on Rodregas‚Äô body stood at attention.
 Then the blue flaming energy was sucked into the pale green circle.
 There the prisoner, now empty of his own essence, stood still.
 As the blue fire was sucked into his body, the corporal body suddenly seemed more solid than before.
 Once more Ravenhurr yelled out in his melodious voice the trigger words for the next part of the ritual, ‚ÄúMana faria podia ricoria.‚Äù It was now or never for Rodregas to strike.
 Rodregas raised his arm up and threw his club forward with all his strength.
 There was no time to see if his club hit Junnit or if the half AElfin maiden ran.
 Rodregas half ran and half jumped to the next circle, where Ravenhurr stood with raised arms.
 Ravenhurr was focused on his inner magic and was not prepared for his own guards‚Äô sudden action.
 Rodregas grabbed Ravenhurr‚Äôs arm and his belt, and using his weight and momentum against Ravenhurr, threw him bodily into the circle of colorful crystals where the half AElf maiden had stood moments ago.

At the word, I realized I was parched, bone dry.
 I forced myself up, keeping my eyes tight as I concentrated on getting the glass to my lips.
 They were rough, cracked; I could feel them against the rim of the glass.
 I wondered if it was dried blood or if I had been down so long they‚Äôd simply split.
 I drank the full glass and felt it exchanged for another.
 I finished it as well and started to lean back.
 There was a pillow behind me now, keeping me in a sitting position.
 It was soft.
 Everything surrounding me felt warm and smooth.

 Buddy‚Äôs solos were like fluid silver; he was re-inventing the electric guitar.
 It was around this time that Buddy began writing songs.
 He was shy about it.
 No one knows how many he wrote before he brought the first one to the group, the one that would later be their most requested song, ‚ÄúI Love my Aunt Jemima.‚Äù  Soon, though, he was bringing in songs in coacervations, as if he had eons of them bubbling up.

I remembered the tree and was suddenly afraid for him.
 Would Anvil use the same method on a person?
 A thunderous crack answered my unspoken question.
 The lightning bolt was faster than my eyes at such a close distance, by the time I looked at Steed, there was nothing but a wall of water.
 He had constructed a barrier of sorts, caught the strike and redirected it around himself by melting the snow that spotted the mountain.
 Anvil was winded, though the strike wasn‚Äôt as severe as his previous show.
 Steed would unquestionably be the winner now and as he took aim to retaliate, his opponent raised his hands in surrender.
 ‚ÄúQuick thinking, Mister Summit.‚Äù The large man grinned and I was in no doubt they were old friends.
 Chevelle stepped forward then, eager.

It seemed like such a waste, leaving the grotto after all the work that'd been put into transforming it, but Alec waved away my protests.
 He easily cradled me in one arm, while carefully picking up my painting with his free hand.
 A short time later, we were back inside the house and headed towards his room.
 Cuddled up against his chest with the familiar, warm tingle caressing my skin, my system apparently decided I was completely safe, and started shutting down.
 I was doing a fairly respectable job of hiding my drooping eyelids, but all my efforts were undone by the prodigious yawn that ambushed me as he set me down on the bed.
 "I'm not tired, I promise."
 His eyebrow arched in disbelief as I pulled him down onto the bed, and I found myself admitting the truth.
 "Okay, I might be a little tired, but it isn't a big deal.
 I want to spend as much time with you as possible.
 After all, it isn't like I'm going to be able to really get much rest between now and whenever we need to leave for the challenge."

I decided to take the easy way out, and picked up a couple of blanket-wrapped mirrors.
 I didn't unwrap either of them.
 That was dangerous too.
 The face that'd look back out of the glass would look almost more like hers than mine.
 Shoulder-length blond hair and blue eyes still seemed to be all the rage, but mine were ruined by pale skin that burned instead of tanning, and a build that had retained its baby fat long after most of the other girls had started slimming down.
 Those extra inches had evaporated recently, but of course it couldn't be a cause for celebration.
 When Mom surfaced enough to notice how much weight I'd lost, she worried I was developing an eating disorder.
 She couldn't seem to understand that I hated the new me more than she did.

Ravenhurr loved to boast that the tube brought the stars closer to him.
 He was never one to hurry about anything, at least not before tonight.
 At that moment, though, his lean body quivered with excitement.
 ‚ÄúMaster," Rodregas said, with a respectful bow, "The prisoners are ready.‚Äù Ravenhurr looked up.
 His eyes passed over Rodregas to glance at the prisoners.
 He nodded without a word and went back to peering through the tube.
 Rodregas had never understood how the stars in the night sky could make the world closer or farther away from the Celestial Realm, where the Gods lived, or how that could affect magic, but he knew the placement of the stars was critical to the success of the ceremony tonight.
 Ravenhurr was an attractive man, like most of the Immortalist Sorcerers.
 After all, if you can pick your body, why would you ever choose an ugly one?
 Rodregas looked over again at the man that he had brought up the stairs.

 Alec came back towards us with an air of resignation.
 Mallory tenderly accepted the letter he produced from a pocket somewhere, and then waited while Alec knelt in front of her.

 He was thoughtful for a moment, deciding the best way to display his skill, before finally approaching to offer his hand.

But debates regarding the appropriate speed and social cost of reforms divert attention from a more fundamental problem with this approach.
 The essence of shock therapy is a reliance on macro-economic factors to bring about a radical restructuring of the economy and a radical change in the behaviour of individuals and enterprises.
 While monetary policy may prove useful for dealing with short-term adjustment problems within a relatively stable environment, there is no evidence to support its use as the principle instrument for social transition.
 Monetary variables are indicators of the functioning of an economy, but the essential factors which determine the strength and health of an economy are the productivity of its enterprises and its workforce and the material resources of the country.
 Tight monetary policy can generate intense short-term pressure for change in behaviour, but this pressure is applied indiscriminately and often with unexpected and unanticipated results.
 The primary result of premature liberalization of prices was to encourage trade and speculation while discouraging production and investment.
 It distracted attention from fundamental changes in institutions and social attitudes needed for the transition to be successful.
 Macro-level policy measures have to be complemented and supported by parallel micro-level efforts to educate the population about the new economic system, to generate a free flow of information ‚Äì not just freedom, but the actual exchange of information, which is still severely limited in these countries ‚Äì to develop new distribution systems, to impart appropriate business and managerial skills, to provide access to credit, to build up new social institutions and to en courage and promote new enterprises.
 In most cities of the former Soviet Union, for instance, there is not a single whole sale market for food.
 There are no systems for consumer credit, no agencies in charge of promoting small business development.

businesses are concentrated at the local and national level. There are no national and local banking and financial institutions and no government agencies and institutions.<eop> A major problem with this approach is the lack of evidence for social transition92m.0m It is not just92m the0m lack of evidence that is the key to its failure; it is92m the0m lack of scientific and historical evidence92m for0m its transition.

The role of democracy in development would be even more compelling were it not for the apparently contradictory evidence posed by the recent experience of Russia and China.
 Russia hastened to introduce democratic reforms in the hope that they would lead to rapid economic advancement.
 China preferred to postpone political reforms until the economic transition was much further advanced.
 As an immediate result, China has the highest economic and employment growth rates among the nations of the world, while Russia has experienced three successive years of steeply declining national income.
 These differences are of vital importance, but they centre around the issue of the best strategy for the transition in human terms, not on the ultimate importance of democracy to continuous economic development.
 The opening up to foreign trade and investment, the spread of higher education which is essential to achieve global competitiveness and the rising living standards which the market system will generate ‚Äì all serve to undermine the legitimacy and staying power of the single-party system.
 China has released a social movement that is rapidly shifting power from the Party to market-responsive institutions and special interest groups, which include wealthy entrepreneurs, provincial officials, workers and peasants.
 Final assessment of China‚Äôs strategy will be determined by the further response of the political system to rising social expectations and growing pressure for greater individual freedom.

 In truth he did not know how good or bad their odds were.
 He knew they were not good, but his mind did not spin with the odds.
 He simply focused on the rightness of Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs words.
 Trying to attack an armed keep probably had far worse odds, and for what?
 So that they could steal horses; so that they could better their odds to escape a future fight?

Everything was silent.
 He listened but heard no signs of approaching guards.
 They had probably heard something but none would question the master, or at least the person they thought was the master.
 He pulled his way in through the shattered remainder of the door; in the middle of the room was a large round table with several books and papers spread out on it.
 Next to the open windows was a very nice desk with a very comfortable looking chair; next to the fireplace were several larger overstuffed and even more comfortable looking chairs.
 There were not as many books as Rodregas had thought there would be; only one wall was covered in shelves and miscellaneous piles of scrolls and other items.
 Next to the desk there was a fancy set of shelves with glass covers to protect them.
 He went over to the glass enclosed shelves; the books looked richly made but old.
 Books of sorcery would sell very well indeed.

My mother was also left bearing the responsibility of a huge IRS tax lien and a mountain of bills.

 Valentine‚Äôs Day, 1981, I decided to go to this local pick-up joint with Bill and hang with the rest of the hounds.
 This club, called ‚ÄúThe Phone Company,‚Äù had phones on every table surrounding a dance floor.
 Each table had a number posted on a short pole that protruded above the phone.

 Marie knew that the stern look her father gave John was intended to mask the love and pride he felt.
 Her own heart tightened with love.
 She never would have dreamed that her disappearance would bring her family closer together.
 John and Mrs. Tranton went to get dressed, doing so in record time.
 The four were in the living room discussing a late August trip to Cape Cod when the doorbell rang.

And, of course, we were too young, but we managed to hang out on the fringes for a while, until we became accepted, through the music, through the music.
 And about the time I would have graduated from high school we got the chance to make that album, what we thought was our big break, our rocket to stardom.
 So, while my girlfriend and my friends and ex-friends were preparing for baccalaureate, we were rehearsing songs in that old gas station for Turntable Poison.
 It was a heady time.

I made it all the way to her door before remembering the Jeep hadn't been downstairs.
 Typical.
 The one time I had good news, and she wasn't around.
 I wandered back downstairs, more because it was cooler down there than because I had any real desire to work on homework.
 Once I was down there though, I grimly decided to open up my bag and make some progress before Mom got home.
 I pulled my feet up on the couch, leaned back against the arm and rested my Spanish book on my knees.
 I momentarily wondered if I should make myself quite so comfortable as my eyes closed.
 The doorbell came as an abrupt surprise, waking me from the nap I hadn't intended on taking.
 I'd been in one of the surreal, vivid dreams.
 It was already too distant to remember details, but I had the impression of being on a mountaintop during the day with vision so acute that I'd been able to see the individual motes of dust.

I couldn't breathe until the dust settled, and Alec rolled back up to his feet, dripping blood from a large gash in his side.
 Dominic heard my sudden gasp and reached over to reassure me.
 "He's okay.
 We heal fast, and he heals faster than most."
 "So this isn't normal?"
 Dom shook her head again.
 "No, in most packs, any confrontation ends in violence.
 Generally there are a whole host of dominants who want to become the alpha.
 This would usually turn into a real dominance fight, with the other two doing their very best to kill him before turning on each other to fight over the spoils."
 "That's terrible."

The drab colors were gone, leaving scenes made up of multi-hued strands of light.
 It was like waking up and having someone tell you they'd been reading your mind.
 The pieces weren't of specific places or events from my dreams, but they were an exact match for how they'd looked and felt.
 I felt my hands start to shake.
 It was like I'd had too much forced on me too quickly.
 I wanted to just collapse and let unconsciousness overcome me, but something pulled me onward towards the next series of pictures, and then the next after that.
 I wanted to stop.
 Each piece opened up another fragment of my soul, revealing a new pain that I'd kept hidden for the last few months.
 The last picture was next to a door, which I opened almost without realizing I was doing so.
 The organized confusion of a true artist met my gaze.

"You've never actually been on a school bus before, have you?"
 Rachel blushed a little bit.
 "Well, no not really.

 I found myself returning her smile.
 You really couldn't spend any time around Rachel and not find yourself smiling.
 "Well, I've heard about bus trips that were extremely fun, but I've never been on one before.
 For me it's always been way too much time crammed into a relatively small space with fifty or sixty other people and no bathroom.

"That's different," he muttered, glancing away.

 When he didn't answer, she took his hand, lacing her fingers with his.

After a mile or so I‚Äôm questioning whether, on that Sunday as he walked over the hill between Sylvia's house and Kenny Niedermeyer's, Eric got handed the choice to save me and/or Billy, or to save himself.
 The only answer I receive is a maybe.
 But all I need is to recognize the long shot possibility that the dearest person I have known gave his life for me and, despite the sorrow, my heart leaps with adoration.
 For a moment on Highway 101 in Pismo Beach, I feel sure that Eric was Jesus.
 Not in full, as in a Second Coming.
 But in a way so that Jesus entered him and took possession.
 While this thought grips me, both Eric and Jesus become so precious the word adore feels timid and weak.

Based on the amount of money involved in setting up such a system in the first place, they probably cranked all that out without even the slightest hint of distortion.
 As impressive as the stereo no doubt was, it was all of those shelves filled with books that finally pulled me off of the bed and onto the incredibly lush, maroon carpet.
 Emerson, Ayn Rand, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy were all present.
 Whoever lived here was either incredibly well read, or a complete poser who bought books just for show.
 Almost scared to find out which it was, I reached over and pulled out the copy of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and opened it up to find a well-cared-for book that'd still obviously been read several times.
 I carefully slid the book back into its spot and then noticed the faintest glimmer of light coming from an open doorway off to my right.
 It was an art gallery.
 One covered in pictures that were eerily familiar, all with a circular signature at the bottom right hand corner.
 They were mostly of mundane kinds of things, landscapes, or people, but there were overtones that caressed a hidden chord inside my soul.
 Everything was done in drab, painfully boring colors, overlaid with incredibly vibrant, hues that were almost unreal in their perfection.

 The next day things had calmed down, and Brandon admitted to needing professional help, more than we could offer.
 He had been living on less since he was on lock-down and that was lowering the level in the tests, but he was really never without Oxy.
 It was late 2008 and my business was suffering the effects of the economic meltdown.
 Just a couple of years before that my business income had been five times what it was then.
 Bryce, in college, was working three jobs to pay his own expenses, something we could no longer afford to help with.
 Simply put, we were falling behind on everything and we didn‚Äôt have the money to put Brandon in a rehab; so we began searching the internet for someplace that would take him without an exorbitant amount of cash.
 The State run agencies were crammed with voluntary admissions and court ordered treatment.
 Brandon‚Äôs girlfriend, Tiffanie had already been in a thirty-day rehab twice before.
 We had heard plenty of horror stories from her about her stint in the county rehab: Apparently, several people had over-dosed on drugs while in the facility, one had died, and she had relapsed and used Oxy while she was in there.

The man obliged, taking his bottle of ale and running.
 That taken care of, the half-orc went around back where he found a few worn and uneven crates.
 He lifted one and approved of its strength after a simple test.
 Satisfied, he went back around and placed it against the wall.
 He was about to go back for a second when torchlight flooded the alley.

‚ÄúAnd Grey.‚Äù The wiry man bent and straightened, his movements too quick.
 I drew in a startled breath as two more figures came into view.
 A pair of slender elves stepped in sync as they stopped just outside the group.
 They were tall and lean, dressed in robes the color of ash that only accentuated their shocking silver hair.
 I was convinced the moonlight must have been exaggerating it.
 And then I jumped again as, on either side of them, two beasts walked forward to stand just in front of the twinned elves.
 Steed brushed an arm against mine, mumbling under his breath, ‚ÄúYeah, they‚Äôre not from around here.‚Äù I felt myself leaning on Chevelle for support.

Since I just finished with Rachel and was over here already, I thought I'd show you the steps you're missing."
 I nodded my assent as I mentally filed away both his name and the girl's.
 Surprisingly enough, Albert was a good teacher, pointing out the steps I'd been skipping over, and even explaining why they were important.
 It was rare enough to find a school teacher who could really teach math these days, finding a student who could teach was nearly a miracle.
 Rachel packed up her things while I was being instructed in the finer points of inequalities.
 As she slid the last book into her backpack, Albert stepped away from my desk with another smile.
 I flipped over to the next chapter and started in on functions as Rachel exited out a corner door I hadn't noticed before.
 I saw a flash of the stunted, brown vegetation that the locals called grass before the door swung back closed.
 Suppressing an urge to just surrender and go outside until Britney finished up, I got started.
 The roar of some kind of high-performance engine a few seconds later almost changed my mind, but my native stubbornness kicked in before I let the thought get out of hand.

This has been true of the arrangements for international security which have governed international affairs during the present century and which provided the underlying dynamism for the First World War and, when the failed attempt at forming a League of Nations left the world unprepared to deal with fascism, for the Second World War as well.
 The skewed division of powers allotted under the UN Charter contained the seeds for the bipolar, intensely adversarial relationship between the two military blocs that resulted in the Cold War and the arms race between the superpowers.
 All these arrangements have been based on the concept of competitive security.
 The competitive security paradigm is a state-centred, egocentric approach in which the security of each nation is perceived in terms of its military superiority over potential adversaries.
 The push of each nation for unlimited security through military power is inherently destabilizing, since it inevitably increases the level of insecurity of other sovereign states.
 In practice, the effort of nations to arm themselves against perceived external threats generates a sense of insecurity among other nations and compels them in turn to increase military preparedness, thus initiating a vicious spiral, as it did during the Cold War.
 When NATO and the Warsaw Pact had armed themselves to the point where direct confrontation became too risky, mutual suspicion and insecurity led them to fight each other through proxy wars in the developing world.
 Every move by either side was perceived as a potential security threat, prompting a counter by the other.
 Compounded by the inherent instability of nuclear weapons, this doctrine led to the anomaly of increasing military power and steadily decreasing national and international security.
 This highly militarized approach contains an in-built mechanism for escalation that was responsible for the growth of global military expenditure to an all-time peak of $1.2 trillion in 1988.

I felt my skin instantly heat up, and looked down, unable to meet his gaze.
 He let me sit there for a couple of seconds, and then reached out and used one gentle finger to nudge my chin up.
 "What's the matter, afraid I'll be jealous?"
 I shook my head, fighting the urge to look back down.
 "No, there isn't anything to be jealous of.
 I'd never been on a single date before Sanctuary, and you know all about what's happened since I arrived."
 His smile was surprisingly reassuring.
 "That sounds like the easiest one I've asked you yet.
 Why the sudden bashfulness?"
 My throat seemed to be spending an awful lot of the time lately constricted down to the point where speech was all but impossible.

His breathing continued, slow and steady.
 He fought down a laugh, despite all his training.
 As dire as his situation seemed, he could honestly say he had been in worse shape before and survived.
 Three times, even.
 Then his ears heard what he had feared: something walking directly behind him.
 The others might not see him, but seeing wouldn‚Äôt be necessary if one stumbled directly atop his prone body.
 His good hand fingered the bow pinned beneath him.
 If discovered, he would die fighting.
 The footsteps neared.
 A clacking sound haunted his hearing.

 ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve set up a perimeter.‚Äù It was all I had to say for the moment.

 It was dark; even with the dust I‚Äôd not slept through the night.
 I sat up, curling my legs against my chest, and wrapped my arms around them, pulling tightly in.
 Though I didn‚Äôt speak, I occasionally glanced, or glared, at Ruby.
 She sat, immobile, watching me.

I retrieved the documents I‚Äôd hidden after my second trip to the library to find out whether they added anything to the report from the Council‚Äôs record-keeper.
 There wasn‚Äôt much new there, mostly more names, but I did notice a watermark on one of the pages.
 I held it up to the light to better see.
 It was a Council marking and something else.
 I dug out the first pages from under my mattress and examined them closer.
 The pages directly from the record-keeper‚Äôs report all included the same Council mark plus a string of characters.
 Trying to decode them, I realized one of the symbols might simply be a page number.
 And the others, they were probably locators.
 I felt like a fool.
 They were just like the codes used in the library, only more elaborate.

In Spanish, Mrs. Tiggs took special delight in telling us that she'd started grading our tests and a couple of them weren't looking very good.
 I suffered through the last hour of school and then hurried to my locker.
 I didn't really want to meet up with Britney, but I also didn't want to alienate her any more than I already had.
 I shouldn't have even bothered.
 I waited around for a full fifteen minutes before finally heading over to the tutoring lab.
 Britney was watching the door when I arrived.
 She didn't even bother trying to mask the flash of satisfaction that crossed her face when I walked in late, obviously having spent the last little while waiting for her.
 I wanted to scream, or maybe cry.
 It was amazing how quickly a perfect day could go down the tubes.

 "But you love it."
 He took her hand, pressing his lips into her palm.
 "Go put on your bathing suit."
 He'd always had a hard time keeping his eyes off her at the beach, but today it was impossible.
 She was so gorgeous.
 He watched as she rubbed lotion on her lovely legs, her silky dark hair falling forward as she did so.

Somehow I made it to the library without tripping or looking back, though I was nearly overcome with the temptation to turn at the door to see him one more time.
 The library steps curled around the interior of the tree, shelves cut into every space above and below, tables and racks and patrons scattered about the remaining areas.
 I found a dark, empty corner on the third level and relaxed onto a seat, leaning against the inside wall of the old tree and taking in the scent of ancient paper and binding.
 After a momentary pause to blot out the latest incident of poor self-control, I decided to attempt to locate the missing pages by magic.
 I had, after all, succeeded in growing only days ago.
 I concentrated as hard as I could and, though nothing flitted out of the shelves and onto my desk, I had a strong feeling I knew where the documents were.
 It also could have been that I knew where they had fallen from the day before.
 Regardless, I made my way over and took a few volumes and scrolls back to my secluded table.
 I was able to find several documents on the northern clans and even one of the missing pages of names‚ÄîL.
 I had spread them out on the table and was studiously examining them when a shadow crossed my desk.

"I don't get it.

 I shook my head in exasperation.
 "Me telling you the answers won't help you on the test.
 If you have a specific question about how to work a problem I'd be more than happy to help you, but I'm not going to do your homework for you."
 Britney looked like she had all kinds of things that she'd like to say, but she showed more restraint that I'd realized she was capable of, and kept them all inside.
 "Please explain this one then."
 I ran through three different examples of the same problem before she got it, but thirty minutes later she was finally working on her homework for the first time I'd ever seen.
 I was surprised just how satisfying it was.
 Maybe I should become a teacher.

Hardwood bows rested high on their backs.
 The wolves were mostly concealed on the ground, vigilant.
 One glanced up at me, at the bird.
 Someone approaching, robe and tassels blowing in the cool breeze.
 The second wolf looked forward.
 He saw it, too, and abruptly pointed, calling out.
 But the howl echoed in my own ears, not my imagination, and I jolted upright.
 The field was in motion, rushing in response to the warning.
 In seconds, they were set again, the same protective positions they had taken the last time.

Then I watch a family, a couple and two daughters, strolling beside the river.

 "Did he just say they were drawing for free tickets?"
 Brandon looked slightly amused.
 Cassie, who I'd just interrupted, looked very much not amused.
 "I think so.

If you are a father or a mother now, there was a day when you were a son or a daughter.
 Perhaps one day you will become a grandparent.
 During all of these periods your experiences and certain moments mold you into who you will be.
 It isn‚Äôt easy to forget the dark places in your past but you can either learn from them and become a better person or repeat the same behavior and have it slowly destroy you.
 I make many mistakes as a father, but I have always tried the best I know how.
 Sometimes no matter what a person does as a parent, children may travel to dangerous places.
 Some will return from those places unharmed and some may never return.
 A family can look perfect from the outside but be quite the opposite on the inside.
 I have lived such a life.
 I do not know what made me do what I did for my son but I can only surmise that it was a combination of all of the defining moments in my life that lead me to where I am today.

She couldn't kiss another man.
 Reluctantly she pulled away.
 "I guess we should finish washing your car."
 "OK."  His eyes focused on her lips.
 His tiny bit of contact with them had been electric.
 He suspected that if he persisted, he could break down her resistance, but he cared about her too much to do that.
 Marie couldn't stop thinking about Rick's kiss.
 It had been brief, but she could remember everything about it in vivid detail.
 She closed her eyes as she stood in the shower, reliving the moment.

 Late morning on a Saturday.
 Jim is relaxed in one of the couches, rereading the newest edition of his favorite comic book when Eugene walks in.

Neither parent thought the other was good enough for their child, let alone the fact that they were both still children.
 Once the reason for the marriage was revealed, their parents accepted it as best as they could.
 My father‚Äôs parents arranged for them to live together in a small home while they finished school and awaited the birth of their baby.
 It was the late fifties and a pregnant teenager was an embarrassment.
 Shame followed the couple wherever they went.
 Thomas Richard was born on a cold December day to parents who were children themselves.
 I followed just 13 months later, and another brother was born 14 months later and died almost immediately after his birth.
 My mother at 20 years old had two toddlers and had to accept the death of her third baby.
 Years later, I returned to this town and located the home we first shared.
 The home, which had since been converted into a one car garage, still had the old front door located next to a single car garage door that had been put in place of what was once the front window.

As he searched for a way to scale the wall, he saw a drunken man watching him.
 ‚ÄúGet lost,‚Äù Harruq growled.
 The man obliged, taking his bottle of ale and running.
 That taken care of, the half-orc went around back where he found a few worn and uneven crates.
 He lifted one and approved of its strength after a simple test.
 Satisfied, he went back around and placed it against the wall.
 He was about to go back for a second when torchlight flooded the alley.
 ‚ÄúMove and you‚Äôll find an arrow in your throat,‚Äù said a voice.
 ‚ÄúPincushion him anyway,‚Äù urged another.
 Harruq held a hand before his eyes, cursing his awful luck.

I felt like I'd been hit in the stomach.
 I hadn't realized just how fond of me Mrs. Campbell was.
 My mind whirling with too many thoughts to sort out, I turned to go back to my desk, only to find Alec staring at me.
 He still didn't seem happy to be sharing the same room with me, but the complete disgust from half an hour before had been replaced with something more measuring.
 In Spanish, Mrs. Tiggs took special delight in telling us that she'd started grading our tests and a couple of them weren't looking very good.
 I suffered through the last hour of school and then hurried to my locker.
 I didn't really want to meet up with Britney, but I also didn't want to alienate her any more than I already had.
 I shouldn't have even bothered.
 I waited around for a full fifteen minutes before finally heading over to the tutoring lab.

She caught her breath, unable to respond.
 To her delight, she saw that he was going to kiss her.
 She closed her eyes, savoring the anticipation and then the sweetness of his lips on hers.
 When, after a few seconds, he didn't end the kiss, her heartbeat sped up.
 He'd never kissed her this long before.
 But her eyes flew open when she felt his hand slide under her skirt to squeeze her thigh.
 Panicking, she tried to push him away.
 But he pinned her against the back of the sofa, his mouth becoming rough.
 She tried to break away from him because he was kissing her so hard that her teeth were cutting into her lips; she could taste the blood.
 But he wouldn't let her go.

The game was against our team‚Äôs rival, Grossmont High School.
 My mother graduated there.
 The gym was ancient.
 The double entry doors each featured a quartet of small windows.
 When the gatekeeper refused to let us in because the tickets were sold out, Kenny‚Äôs usual good nature expired.
 He raised a fist as though to sock the gatekeeper, a boy in an ROTC costume.
 But instead of punching the kid, he drove his fist through one of the small windowpanes.
 The gatekeeper hollered.
 The next instant, we found ourselves surrounded by teachers, coaches, and a platoon of the ROTC.
 While the chatter of several witnesses turned it all into gibberish, and the gatekeeper shouted, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been drinking,‚Äù Kenny stood still, staring at his bloody fist as though wondering how it happened.

I do not know her name, other than what she instructed my brother and I to call her: Mama Tun.
 Our father was from Woodhaven, she told us.
 We later found out he was an elf, bizarre as it seems.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúIt is a wretched elf who would mate with an orc,‚Äù Velixar said.
 ‚ÄúNo true elf would,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúThis means he was weak to have done so.

The woman who appeared a few seconds later seemed frail in a way that somehow wasn't attributable to her graying hair, or slender frame.
 It wasn't until she released Alec from a hug, and slowly moved back into the cabin, that I realized it was how she moved that made her seem so old.
 Her motions reminded me of how my grandfather had moved the last few years before he'd died.
 Slowly, and with extra care, as if a careless action would leave him crumpled on the floor, racked with pain.
 "Mallory, I'd like to introduce you to Adriana Paige.
 Adriana, Mallory."
 I smiled, and gingerly offered my hand to her, which she clasped in both of hers.
 "I'm very happy to finally get to meet you, young lady.
 Alec is better company than most, but it's nice to have a new face around here."
 I felt myself warming to her immediately, even more so as she ushered us into her small sitting room and clucked over me, all the while proclaiming that I was far too skinny.

Over the past month, she had grown close to the half-orc Harruq Tun, and with that closeness was danger.
 She saw only a goofy young man while Dieredon swore she met with a killer.
 Only one of them could be right, but who?
 Perhaps not, she wondered.
 Perhaps she saw the elf in Harruq while Dieredon saw the orc.
 The kindest man might become a brute when surrounded by other brutes.
 When Harruq was with his brother, or the strange man in black, how then did he behave?
 Could he kill?
 Could he murder?
 She had to know.

If it resulted in me seeing Brandon again today it couldn't be all bad.
 In fact, my life felt pretty much perfect right now.
 Wait, not quite.
 If he'd greeted me with a hug in addition to the smile, then things would have been perfect.
 I felt myself blushing almost as soon as the thought crossed my mind.
 My family wasn't...hadn't been demonstrative.
 I wouldn't know what to do if he hugged me.
 In an effort to cover my embarrassment, I turned back to Rachel and James, only to feel my jaw figuratively hit the ground.
 James was standing between Rachel and Brandon, slightly crouched in a posture that looked strangely familiar.
 I heard footsteps to my left as Brandon finished crossing the last few feet between us.

It must have been a dream.
 I had fallen asleep looking at my mother‚Äôs pendant, trying to remember her, and somehow combined it with the disaster I had read of the northern clans.
 It was only a dream.
 Shaken, I sat up, struggling to collect myself.
 I reached up to remove the pendant from the hook and squeezed it tight in my fist.
 It felt good, like a connection, and I slid the leather chain over my head, pulling the pendant down to rest on my chest.
 It felt right there and I knew I should have been wearing it all along.
 As I let go, I realized I‚Äôd gotten blood on my hands, so I headed to the hall and poured water from the pitcher into a ceramic basin.
 Staring into the mirror was not my favorite pastime.

Would that bother you?"
 "Yes."
 She'd become so accustomed to being honest with him that she didn't even think about dissimulating.
 "Why?"
 When she merely glanced up at him and quickened her pace, he caught her arm.
 "I'm sorry--don't be mad.
 I'll buy you some frozen yogurt.
 That'll make you feel better."
 She gave him a small smile, but when they reached the yogurt stand, she said that she didn't want any.

Chevelle stayed in the front room that night, watching through the small windows.
 When I closed my eyes, I could see the glint of swords making patterns as they crossed again and again.
 Ruby‚Äôs hummed tune was sad, the sound drifting through the walls between us as I fell into an easy sleep.
 Chevelle and Ruby‚Äôs voices, low and confrontational, woke me.
 I rubbed my tired arms as I rose to join them in the front room.

The rest of the school must be three or four times as bad.
 Sketching helped block out all of the inane conversation that'd taken over the other corner of the room.
 It was amazing how easily I was able to zone out while drawing.
 Once again, I didn't try to guide my hand, just let my subconscious create a horizon and start fleshing out a body of water and droopy trees around it.
 The sound of a hand coming down hard on a desk pulled me from my refuge.
 "I told you all to keep it to a dull roar.
 I want everyone back to your seats."
 A couple people looked like they wanted to give the sub a hard time, but these were all the kids who were hoping to make it into the top ten percent of their graduating class.
 None of them really had a disobedient bone in their body.
 They grudgingly returned to their seats and left Alec by himself.

Two contestants had already fought.
 The rules were simple.
 Two went in and one came out walking.
 The constants were bare of chest and foot.
 There were no fancy speeches to start the match, a bell sounded and the next round began.
 Rodregas kept his weight low and his hands up.
 Doi‚Äôvan and he had discussed the best approach.
 Both agreed the best strategy would be to use his full strength and speed to be quick and as brutal as he could without killing.
 Doi‚Äôvan suggested body blows were best, as a full strength a punch into the face would likely kill a normal human.

 3.Import liberalization: Drastic import liberalization led to the inflow of better-quality, lower-priced foreign goods that depressed demand for domestically produced goods.
 The shock impact of imports was aggravated by the fact that farmers in the region were forced to compete in some cases with subsidized agricultural products from the West.
 4.Privatization: Although the actual progress of privatization has been relatively slow in most instances, the uncertainty regarding the future status and ownership of enterprises and property has inhibited investment, slowed up current production, and led to widespread plunder of state property.
 5.Trade: As the socialist structure of these countries began to change and the political influence of the Soviet Union diminished, there was a huge drop in the trade between countries of the region, and, following the break-up of the USSR, between the republics of the Soviet Union as well.
 Not all countries in the region experienced all five shocks.
 Those that were spared proved better able to sustain output and real incomes.
 Czechoslovakia had not suffered from inflation and was largely free of external debt.
 Hungary, which had decentralized its economy and had introduced significant elements of the market in production and investment before 1989, was not subject to the sudden shocks due to import liberalization and termination of planning.
 Lessons from the Reform

Even then, he risked at least two arrows sticking in his flesh.
 Unsure of what to do, he played dumb and let the first soldier approach.
 ‚ÄúCareful, he‚Äôs a biggie,‚Äù the bowman said.
 ‚ÄúNothing I can‚Äôt handle,‚Äù said the other before smashing the butt of his sword into Harruq‚Äôs face.
 Rage surged through the half-orc‚Äôs veins, his orcish side screaming for blood.
 He fought it down even as a mailed fist smashed against his spine.
 Harruq collapsed to his knees, choking down a furious roar.
 ‚ÄúGoes down easy, I say,‚Äù the guard said to the bowman.

Finally, Doi‚Äôvan nodded at Imeralda and said to Rodregas, ‚ÄúIt has been too long since I have prayed as well, it would be good for the soul.
 Please lead us in prayer.‚Äù Imeralda did not say anything, but she nodded and followed the two of them outside.
 Rodregas knelt in the grass facing the sun, the sign of the All-Father in the celestial heavens.
 He reached out and wove his fingers together; he pulled his thumbs down and opened his woven hands in the ancient symbol of opening oneself to the gods.
 ‚ÄúDear Celestials in the heavens, we open our hearts to you and we accept our duties as your warriors here in the world.
 Let your courage fill our hearts and your strength fill our arms.
 May we know the guidance of your twin children, Honor and Justice.‚Äù He then knelt down and pulled one of the two short swords from his weapon harness; he crossed his arms and laid the blade across his own upper arms.
 It was possible, only with great concentration to do this without dropping the sword or cutting himself.

 Mom didn't seem to think it was at all odd that the city had flip-flopped so completely on the job.
 First she had it, then she didn't, now she did again.
 None of it made sense, but she seemed perfectly ready to accept everything at face value.

 End of war: Cessation of war and of the threat of large-scale warfare are essential preconditions for more rapid social progress.
 The end of East‚ÄìWest confrontation and withdrawal of support for proxy wars fuelled by superpower rivalry provide us with the opportunity to build upon and extend peace in the Middle East and South Africa to all regions, to eliminate the use of war as an instrument of policy, and to impose peace within and between nations as a condition for membership and participation in the world community.
 Expansion of world trade: The end of international political confrontation has given a strong impetus to global economic cooperation.
 The successful conclusion of the international trade negotiations, culminating in the establishment of the World Trade Organization, opens up vast potential for nations to increase mutually beneficial economic activity, predicated on the under standing that more trade is good for everyone.
 Studies cited by the World Bank estimate that the removal of trade barriers by the industrial nations would increase the exports of many developing countries by as much as 50 to 100 per cent, representing a gain in real income of $40 billion to $80 billion annually.
 For the least developed countries, these gains could be double the amount of official development assistance.
 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cited reasons for concluding that actual gains may be significantly higher than these estimates.
 New engines for global economy: Economic growth in the developing world is projected to remain strong throughout the decade, averaging 4 to 5 per cent per year in low- and middle-income countries.
 At a time of slackened demand and low levels of growth in most industrial nations, developing countries have become the principal engine driving expansion of the global economy and employment generation, whereas until recently the Third World was perceived primarily as a drag on the world economy or a threat to jobs in the West.

 Rachel looked for a moment like she wanted to disagree, but she nodded, in the kind of noncommittal way people use when they don't really agree, but are ready to let you make your own mistakes.
 Rachel pulled her books together, and then followed me through the door, James two steps behind, and looking, amazingly enough, even more surly than he had a few seconds before.
 Rachel didn't seem to be one of those people who always had to be talking about something, but even so, two minutes of silence were enough to leave me scrambling for something to talk about.

I never remember my mother dating much, so I think she was careful not to introduce us to any suitor until it was more serious.
 She eventually met a man who she was serious about, Dino.
 He would sometimes bring food we were not accustomed to eating, like steak.
 I had no memory of any man ever giving us a gift or anything of the sort before, but occasionally he would bring us a trinket to our mother‚Äôs delight.
 He was a big man with a dark complexion and jet-black hair and he would often talk on the phone in his native Greek.
 Thomas and I had never heard someone speak in a foreign language so it was intriguing.
 My mom soon married Dino and we officially had a stepfather.
 Shortly after they were married we moved north to Sacramento.
 It was a six-hour drive from where my grandparents and uncle lived.
 We said our goodbyes to our sobbing grandmother and to all our friends and entered a new chapter in our lives.

Like the farmhouse, the barn was also built of the same impressive large cut stone.
 However, while the stone was in great shape, all other materials seemed to have fallen apart.

 Some Common Challenges
 Listing future achievements does not mitigate the very real and pressing problems that confront us now.
 A brief catalogue suffices to indicate the magnitude of these challenges.
 Population: In spite of the continued decline in birth rates, world population is expected to rise by nearly three billion people or 50 per cent over the next three decades, making the task of achieving food security, employment and education for all even more daunting than it is today.
 Poverty: The incidence of poverty continues to increase both in relative and absolute terms.
 Presently, 1.4 billion people, constituting 26 per cent of the total population of developing and developed nations, live in poverty.
 The poorest 20 per cent of the world‚Äôs population share a minuscule 1.4 per cent of the world‚Äôs income.
 According to current projections, 300 million people, representing nearly 50 per cent of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, will live below the poverty line at the turn of the century.
 Environment: Unsustainable lifestyles and consumption (in industrial countries) and population growth, along with rising levels of production and consumption (in developing countries), will place strenuous demands on the environment of the planet.

 Dominic stopped just outside of what I was starting to understand was pouncing range for people who happened to have supernatural strength, as Alec gave Brandon a cold smile.
 "If I ever really decide the outcome is a foregone conclusion, you'd better start watching out for your people.
 You'd be surprised just how many of them could disappear if I no longer worried about the consequences of my actions."
 The tingle of Alec's power lessened slightly once we were out of sight, but it still hadn't dropped off completely by the time we were standing in front of Mrs. Tiggs' classroom.
 I could still feel the faintest traces of his power long after he'd finally let my hand go with obvious reluctance and strode off, leaving Dominic and I to find our seats.

 I would have been sure not to trust her, but she was traveling with us.
 It was probably best not to tell her, of all people, that I had no clue where I was or where I was going.
 I needed to stay on this path, now more than ever.
 Chevelle‚Äôs words rolled through my mind.
 He thought I wouldn‚Äôt give up because I‚Äôd seen the map.
 Something about that nagged at me, but Ruby waited while I searched for a response.

 My last conversation with Ashley seemed a little muffled and the cops want to make sure they get a clear recording of the drug deal.
 The reason I am here and have insisted that I do this is complicated.
 I think I am here to save my family the anguish of watching another family member go to jail, not wanting to relive the time I watched my brother Thomas go to a federal prison for dealing drugs many years before.
 Maybe I am here because I just don‚Äôt know how to be a father and despite my attempt to be the best father I never had, I have failed miserably!

A light fog hovers above the shallow water and dissipates into the cattails that line its shore.
 It is getting darker by the moment, but my eyes have adjusted and I can clearly see the cars that cross.
 I eliminate them as they drive past.
 I am looking for one of two cars I believe they will be driving.
 Will it be the red Dodge Charger or the white Lexus sedan or perhaps a complete surprise?
 One way or the next, they know where I am and what I am driving and exactly where I am parked.
 I have met Ashley, so she should have no problem identifying me.
 I focus on the occupants of car after car.

Who were we going to tell?
 About a month after this robbery, I looked out the window of our apartment and to my surprise saw the guy who had set us up for the robbery!
 He was a tall lanky guy with a bushel of hair so he was easy to spot.
 I dragged Pete to the window to show him the guy.
 We hustled down the stairs and I walked straight towards this guy and he didn‚Äôt recognize me at all.
 He asked me if I wanted to buy some pot in exactly the same way he did before.
 I said, ‚ÄúSure, should we follow you to the same apartment so your friends can rob us again?‚Äù He looked shocked and before he could say a word, I dropped him with one punch where he stood and it didn‚Äôt stop there.
 This guy was begging for his life as I pummeled him and Pete just watched in shock.
 I made this scumbag give me every penny he had on him and we never saw him again.
 One day as we walked away from a beach after swimming, a police car pulled over and started to question us.

Now, the discussion is over.‚Äù growled Marshal Faurrenida.
 To forestall any further argument, the Grand Marshal stepped forward quickly and drew his sword.
 The sword gleamed of the highest quality blue steel and red fire seemed to run its length.
 Marshal Faurrenida laid the sword on Rodregas‚Äô right shoulder and said, ‚ÄúSquire, you come to us this day.
 Think well and be sure on your decision to swear these oaths.‚Äù Faurrenida paused for a second and then slowly added.
 ‚ÄúWill you swear to uphold the Rules of Chivalry, to serve the Order of the Soaring Heavens with honor, and to serve as the Champion of the Celestials on this World if called to be a Paladin?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy Lord Grand Marshal, I so swear in the name of the Celestial Gods.‚Äù Strangely, instead of being excited, he felt tired.
 In some ways he was adding another burden and it was heavy.
 ‚ÄúArise, Sir Rodregas, Knight of the Soaring Heavens and be made welcome in the Cathedral of the Heavens.‚Äù Applause filled the room, though it was muted.
 Rodregas looked for Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda and he was sad to see that they had not been there to share his moment.
 Van‚Äôdret at least had left.

I couldn‚Äôt understand why I had bothered dragging it along, but my grip on it was tight.

Instead my mind reached down and pulled extra layers of gauze over itself.
 I looked down at my Spanish test and wondered how I'd gotten here.
 There were answers on the page.
 They were unmistakably done in my awkward scrawl, but didn't make sense.
 I flipped the page over and found more of the same.
 My eyes idly traced down the page, finding blanks and almost of its own accord my pencil reached out and filled them in with words that seemed familiar, but whose meaning I couldn't seem to pin down.
 I resurfaced as I walked into the tutor lab, unsure if I'd passed anyone I should have greeted.
 I sat down at my usual spot and pulled out a book at random as Britney stomped into the room and threw her books down.

She seemed to be paying less attention now to stealth as she was to speed.

 ‚ÄúThey are traveling with a patrol of Immortal guards.
 I think there are only four, but scout patrols often have a warrior with a minor sigil of enhanced senses.

 Introduction by Camel Jeremy Eros
 The veracity of the following has been called into question.
 That the people who would know, the people who were actually there, all three voices heard here, are all dead makes proving it somewhat difficult.
 Buddy Gardner died, famously, of a heroin/pill/alcohol overdose;   Lorelei Enos died only a few years ago by her own hand, after an incident, which was kept out of the papers because of the famous talk show host involved.
 And, Creole Myers, the interviewer, died just last year of cancer.
 But, if you listen, that is, if you can read between the lines here, you‚Äôll find, not only an extraordinary document, but one that could only come from the personalities involved.
 The voices are theirs.

I did fall down when I hit the first slope.
 There was just enough moonlight to confirm that the pain in my hands and elbow was the result of having all of the skin abraded away.
 I thought I was going to pass out, or maybe throw up, but I couldn't cry any harder than I already was.
 Part of me kept expecting Brandon to come running towards me from the direction of the party.
 He'd apologize, and explain how he'd wanted to stop Cassie, but he'd been too stunned by what she was doing.
 Even the delusional part of my brain that was trying to come up with a way to be rescued couldn't create a plausible scenario from there on.
 The look he'd given me at the end hadn't been that kind of shocked gaze.
 Cassie's threat was too vivid.
 Instead of curling up on the ground where I'd fallen, I pulled myself back up and continued to stumble along in the direction I thought would eventually get me back to the road.
 The washed-out landscape mocked me as I realized just how alone I was.

The only positive from the whole weekend was the way my dream from Friday stayed with me.
 As I got ready for school I idly wondered if it would be possible to recreate the grotto in real life.
 Obviously not with the impossible, glowing water, but with the incredible, lush vegetation and the secluded pool.
 Then again, I'd seen Mom pull off some pretty crazy tricks with her camera, maybe there would be some way to simulate glowing water, some kind of photography trick I'd never heard of.
 I walked downstairs as the eastern sky was just starting to change colors.
 Mom was already gone.
 The message board was conspicuously empty, so she was either still frustrated with me, angry at our hopeless situation, or wrapped back up in her quest to become a renowned photographer.
 Britney picked me up on schedule and I somehow made it through my first two classes.
 Mrs. Sorenson was still out to prove to everyone I was an idiot, and Heathcliff was still a psychopath despite Mr. Whethers' best efforts to explain the character's motivation.
 Math was actually the high point of the morning.

"That's a good point, but you can't blame me for being worried, sweetie.
 I mean with this new boyfriend of yours.
 You know I don't trust boys who drive sports cars.
 Especially not the really cute ones who have a way of making every female in sight go all gooey on the inside."
 She slid the window shut with a sigh, rather than screaming in shock, so Alec wasn't lying on the ground with a pair of broken legs.
 Apparently Brandon's charms were enough to make Mom forget herself while he was around, but not so great as to keep her from worrying when he wasn't.
 I shrugged uncomfortably.
 "He's not my boyfriend, Mom.
 I mean he wasn't really ever my boyfriend, but even less so now."
 Mom looked away from the skyline, a new batch of concern painted across her features.

He had been safe from the bounty on his head and for the most part.
 His life was more boring than anything else.
 He approached the door to the tower roof with the prisoners.
 Instead of formulating a plan of action his mind kept going back to the horror of last week's practice when his master, Ravenhurr, demanded a rehearsal of the ritual ceremony with the senior guards.
 At the time he assumed they would merely walk through the procedure.
 Ravenhurr, however, was the kind of man who demanded perfection.
 He demanded it both in himself and from those around him.
 That perfection required no less than an exact replication of the ceremony.
 As usual, he acceded to his master's wishes and did as he was told.
 He knew the value of following orders and it had kept him alive so far.

It obviously hadn't crossed Mom's mind that they might decide to go with someone else.
 Waffling over whether or not to take the job was one thing when she was sure she'd have it in the end.
 It was entirely different when it might cost her the biggest break she'd ever had.
 She nodded jerkily as she stepped out of the room, already dialing.
 I felt my eyelids drooping by the time she came back.
 "They want me to leave right now.
 She said she's already arranged for a charter plane out of St. George.
 If I leave in the next ten minutes, we can make the flight out of Salt Lake International with something like half an hour to spare."
 We both sat there in silence for a few seconds as everything sank in, and then Mom exploded into motion.
 She ran downstairs to repack her photography equipment, all the while yelling upstairs to verify that I'd packed all of the other essentials she was going to need.

Slowly she removed the ring from her finger.

 Rick drew her into his arms, feeling torn apart himself.
 He couldn't bear the thought of losing her.
 But he hated seeing her miserable.

I cursed the formal dress I‚Äôd been dragging as it snagged on a low-lying thicket, flinging another string of beads into the soft dirt.
 I considered dumping it, but didn‚Äôt think it was the best idea to be sneaking around the forest unclothed.
 After crossing a few soggy patches of moss, the hem was damp and darkened.
 I might have ripped some of the excess material off, but Chevelle‚Äôs movement wasn‚Äôt leaving me time for that.
 Finally, just before nightfall, he approached a small village.
 It didn‚Äôt look like more than half a dozen structures scattered against the base of a large hill.
 He dropped the simple pack he‚Äôd been carrying beside a tree and hunched down as he slowed his pace.
 The stance mirrored mine, and gave me pause.
 He was sneaking into this village.
 I watched as he crept around the back of a small hut, knowing that if he was hiding, I definitely didn‚Äôt want to get caught here.

But I preferred not to know.
 I already had earned at least enough shame for a guy my age.
 The way I recall, I tipped backward and landed in the shotgun seat of our Chevy, where I woke up shivering.
 Dawn had commenced.
 The sky was cornflower blue.
 We were parked on dirt near a bridge across the Tia Juana River, about fifty yards downstream from a squatter village of tin-roofed stick and cardboard shacks.
 The river was low and mossy green below a film tinted with shimmering rainbows.
 A few women in rebosos of vivid reds and oranges waded and filled clay pots and coffee cans with water.
 The ni√±os who crawled on the muddy bank had implausibly shiny hair and wide eyes of milk white and gleaming obsidian.
 Beyond the shanties, across the river and the road, a building invaded the sky.

Alec nodded as I looked back and met his eyes.
 "They were pretty close.
 There weren't that many of them, but they could've decided to push the issue regardless."
 I spent the rest of the trip, expecting someone to jump out of the trees, but faster than I'd have believed possible, the wrought iron gates I'd noticed on our trip out last night were swinging open, and we were turning off onto Alec's asphalt lane.
 A distinguished-looking gentleman in his fifties was waiting for us as we screeched to a stop.
 His slightly disapproving frown hinted at decades of practice letting his 'bosses' know when they'd just crossed some kind of line, all the while never crossing any himself.
 The shape shifters all exited the car, most before it had even stopped moving, and then Jessica and Dominic both appeared as I made my comparatively slow way out of the vehicle.

 Chapter 1 Stepping back out into the relentless desert sun, I once again wished we were still back in Minnesota, or at least that we were done moving.
 Then again I might as well have been wishing that Mom had decided on somewhere other than Utah, or that we'd had some long-lost relative die and leave us a small fortune, or even better that Dad and Cindi...
 The thought was much too dangerous to complete.
 My breathing had already sped up, and my balance degenerated so quickly it was a small miracle I made it over to the U-Haul before I keeled over.
 I'd hated the battered vehicle that had spent the last two days carrying us west across I-80.
 It was hard to keep up the feeling though when it was the only thing protecting me from a concussion.
 Half of the horizon was green and beautiful, not land-of-ten-thousand-lakes beautiful, but still not bad.
 I, of course, ended up on the wrong side of the truck; barren dirt and rocks, only occasionally relieved by scrubby plant life, as far as the eye could see.

"I had a bet with myself that you weren't going to wait.
 Somehow the fact I just lost doesn't matter now."
 It didn't seem possible he was talking to me, that anyone so gorgeous could mean something like that about me.
 I opened my mouth, maybe to laugh the comment off, or otherwise hedge my bets against the humiliation and inevitable mocking laughter.
 Whatever it was I'd intended on saying evaporated away the instant he reached out and slowly slid his finger down the side of my face.
 The tiny part of me that was still screaming none of this could be real was pulled along by the rest of me.
 I completely abandoned myself to the sensations created by his touch.
 My nerve endings didn't know whether to classify his finger as icy cold or scorching hot, but before I could recoil in pain the sensation gave way to a tingly warmth that sank down into my center, simultaneously tightening and relaxing parts I didn't even know I had.
 My pounding heart seemed loud enough to hear from across the street.
 I opened my eyes, afraid he could somehow hear the overworked muscle, already flushing red with embarrassment, only to find a gentle smile waiting for me.

Doi‚Äôvan though was more focused on the task than the oath.
 He stated, ‚ÄúEach competition is worth points.
 The top five winners of each round of competition earns five points; those that place six through ten earn four points, eleven through fifteen earn three points and so on.
 There are a total of five different events.‚Äù Rodregas nodded.
 He had not remembered the point system but he knew well that a knight is unique for his mastering of five different fighting styles.
 Doi‚Äôvan continued, ‚ÄúThe first they call ‚Äòopen fist‚Äô which does not really make any sense to me, but it is barehanded with no armor.
 I think you are likely to do very well with that one.

I felt my skin heat up again, but managed to stick my tongue out.
 "No, we're not quite there yet, but before we continue on, I need your promise not to discuss this with anyone.
 Not even the rest of the pack."
 I was taken aback with his sudden intensity, and part of me wanted to bristle at the implication I couldn't be trusted with a secret.
 His expression softened a little as he reached into the small bag mounted on the fuel tank, and handed me a bottle of water.
 I hadn't even realized I was thirsty until that second.
 "I'm sorry, Adriana.
 I know I can depend on you, this is just important enough that I needed to make sure you understood what's riding on your discretion."

Alec is a remarkable fighter, to hear Donovan speak of it, he's possibly even almost the equal of his father, but Brandon's strength and speed have not seen a match in centuries.
 It's likely Brandon will emerge the victor."
 Even though, or possibly exactly because it was what I'd suspected, the words sent slivers of ice through me.
 My heart seemed to be having a hard time maintaining a steady rhythm, but I forced myself not to give into the panic attack that was promising temporary relief from the horror of my life.
 With what I'd just been told, I should be able to put some of the pieces together.
 "Once Alec is dead, there'll be repercussions for everyone else?"
 Again the short, reluctant nod.
 I had so many questions I still wanted answered, but it didn't seem fair to get Isaac in any more trouble than he was already in.

But I couldn‚Äôt.
 I needed to find out what that thing was and what it had killed.
 I also had a horrible feeling, deep down that made me know that this wasn‚Äôt a dream but some type of vision.
 This was happening in real life, right now in Igneeria.
 That proved that Igneeria had worse things to hide than what we thought was bad.
 The thing walked forward and the crowd parted to make it a path, falling silent.
 I find myself creeping back until I could barely see the scene below.
 I was afraid that it would see me.
 Then I got a glimpse of what it had killed and I had to hold back my tears.
 The poor body of the dwarf who had brought us here was lying in a contorted heap, limbs twisted in all directions.

She'd known I couldn't handle the reminder of what we'd lost, but she'd been unwilling to give up that link to the past.
 The thought slipped away like sunlight skipping across water a split second before the storm arrived.
 The attack was a bad one.
 I lost more time.
 I must have slept at some point, but the next time I surfaced it was Saturday morning and I was sitting in front of an empty bowl with an unopened box of cereal and a gallon of milk waiting in the wings.
 At some point I realized I wasn't hungry.
 I put everything back away and went upstairs for a shower.
 It didn't help.
 By the time I was done, I was clean but just as emotionally numb as before.

For a second I worried I was going to pass out, but movement behind the two punks distracted me from my heaving internal landscape.
 There was just enough light for me to see Alec lean forward and put a hand on each troublemaker's shoulder.
 There was an abortive movement by the two loudmouths, as they tried to spin around and confront him.
 Granted, the lighting was less than ideal, but it didn't look like Alec was holding onto them very hard.
 Still, neither of them made it more than a quarter of the way around before being slammed back down into their chairs.
 The tingly heat that'd convinced me Alec was staring at me earlier was back, and even more intense.
 I felt the tiny hairs on my neck stand up as the feeling redoubled yet again.
 The darker, more vocal of the two opened his mouth and got the first part of a swear word out before ending in a hiss of pain that was almost completely drowned out by a crescendo from the orchestra pit.
 Alec leaned forward, whispered something in each of their ears, and then finally let both of them go.
 I expected them to turn around swinging, or at least swear at him.

 Chapter 17 I reached out groggily to turn off my alarm, and then wished it was still the weekend so I wouldn't have to get up and go to school.
 I finished off my normal morning routine with a pair of aspirin from the bathroom cupboard.
 I didn't usually like taking drugs of any kind, but I had a sharp headache building already.
 I shuffled downstairs, waved a speechless hello to Mom, grabbed my lunch, bag, and books as I absently wondered why there was a cupcake on the counter with a lit candle.

 All that made him maintain it was the knowledge that her father would kill him if he laid a finger on her before marriage.

 As it appears I‚Äôm too attached to the world to live for and with God like Brother Lawrence did, I try to console myself by thinking of one of my favorite writers, Andre Dubus.

 Sometime before dark I left and wandered alone, toward and up a hill called Eastridge that overlooked our school, along a street of vacant lots, sometimes escaping into in my usual obsessions about Karen Flagstad or whether I should play baseball or golf that spring.
 But after a moment, the truth returned.
 Nothing that mattered yesterday mattered anymore.
 My gut felt as if a big snake were coiled inside it.
 My heart was a huge lump of coal.

The drapes were swaying gently as if they'd been brushed by someone moving quickly, but other than that there was no trace of him.
 It wasn't until I'd filed out into the grand foyer, eager to spend a few minutes taking in the gorgeous bronze statues liberally scattered throughout the room, that I realized why I felt so odd.
 Part of the difference was the normal sensation of having vicariously been part of something larger than life.
 My head knew all I'd done was sit motionless while performers portrayed a fictional story.
 The rest of me felt as though I had just risked life and limb, seen people I loved killed, and played a small but tangible part in altering the course of history.
 Returning to my mundane, ever so boring life was an incredible letdown, but that didn't explain the hollow sensation that'd lodged itself somewhere between my heart and stomach.
 Illogical as it sounded, the only explanation for feeling as though a part of me had been ripped out and lost was Alec's having disappeared sometime between the last note and the final bow.
 It was unsettling.
 Even my growing feelings for Brandon didn't hint at that kind of need.
 It was a pale shadow of what it felt like to lose a family member, but it was made up of too many of the same elements.

The plan was formed: I‚Äôd practice until I was strong enough to return to the village.
 There was nothing holding me back.
 Nothing to do but this one thing.
 I spotted a small toad as it leapt across the clearing in a desperate attempt to escape the inferno.
 I concentrated on it, willing it to change.
 Its wide body started to swell, sides bubbling out, puffing it into a tiny green balloon.
 It did not transform into that monarch butterfly I had imagined.
 It burst, spewing entrails across the hem of my dress.
 My head fell into my hands as I groaned.
 It took a while, but the anger eventually faded to a point where I realized I‚Äôd need a new plan.

And then Ruby was beside us from out of nowhere, her words startling me back to the cold, dull room.
 ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre coming in.‚Äù Chevelle leaned back, his fingers brushing my collarbone when he pulled away.
 I bit my lip at the tingle that ran through me, and the corner of his mouth turned up into a different kind of smile.
 He stood to walk from the room and I stared at the stone entry, struggling to keep my thoughts from spinning out of control.
 Too much had happened.
 Too much was wrong.
 My life had flipped, twisted into some strange reflection of itself, and I couldn‚Äôt reconcile the fragments.
 It caused me physical pain to think about Chevelle‚Äôs touch, about council, about what was happening, and I knew it was the bonds.
 When Grey walked out, my trance broke and I noticed Ruby by the front window, wearing an odd smile.
 I flushed and turned from her, rolling into a ball on my blankets, remembering no more than the feel of his skin on my neck, the quirk of his lips.

As he glanced up, he slid whatever he‚Äôd been working on into a pocket at his hip.
 It dawned on me then that the main room had only the entrance and two other doors.
 If we were staying with Ruby then the second room must be hers.
 I meant to offer Chevelle my room to sleep in, but the look on his face was so unnerving I could not stop myself from offering something else.
 ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt have to protect me.‚Äù I hoped it was true.
 ‚ÄúI can turn myself in, take myself to the village, or‚Ä¶‚Äù I was trying to say Grand Council, but the words stuck in my throat.
 No part of me wanted to surrender to my mother‚Äôs killers, but I could not make Chevelle suffer more than he already had.
 My hands trembled and I tightened them into fists.
 He was my watcher; he must have felt he needed to fulfill his duties, to keep his honor.
 He would finish our journey and return me to the village.

Velixar glanced back at his companions, who now numbered in the thousands.

Davis thought they were a waste of time.
 Marie climbed into bed with a frown.
 She and Davis were going to have to have a serious discussion.
 She didn't intend to have a husband whom she saw only at meals and at bedtime.

 Marie awoke at dawn the next morning and jumped into her clothes.
 She was halfway down the stairs when she remembered she'd promised Rick that she'd wake him up so that he could stay within earshot of her.

Junnie was exceedingly clean and organized, so I couldn‚Äôt tell if she‚Äôd even been home.
 I wandered back to the front door and was surprised by a tall figure there.
 The elaborate robe and tassels of a decorated council member blocked my way and the fear returned.
 ‚ÄúElfreda.‚Äù I cautiously dipped my head in respect.
 ‚ÄúJuniper Fountain has received the calling.‚Äù I stared at him in disbelief, stuttering out a, ‚ÄúWha‚Äî‚Äù But then I caught myself, because I had heard clear enough.
 The more important question was, ‚ÄúWhen?‚Äù He grimaced at my disrespectful manner.
 ‚ÄúNot long.‚Äù Not long?

 Not long from now?
 I felt sick.

She took a minute to get her bearings and then wandered back toward Rick‚Äôs house.
 He was perched on the edge of a chair and sprang to his feet when he saw her.
 ‚ÄúAre you all right, sweetheart?‚Äù he asked, taking her hand.
 ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt get home.‚Äù Tears filled her eyes.
 ‚ÄúI tried so hard.

He immediately launched himself onto Emily.
 She screeched and I thought I saw one of the kids turn around.
 He crawled up to her ear and whispered something that I couldn‚Äôt hear.
 She froze, but I saw her place her hands on his wrinkled skin.
 Fire flared from her fingertips, scorching his skin.
 He let out a screech and vaulted off her, running as fast as his legs could take him.
 I held an arrow out and Emily set it ablaze.
 I drew back, launching the arrow, and watching it as it hit the dwarf in the back.
 The fire charred its dying body and I looked away to face my new attacker.

He was learning what it meant to work full days, to budget money, and generally act responsible.
 He meant to enroll in adult school and complete his senior year that way, meanwhile saving all he could toward the date of his graduation when he would go looking for some kind of apprentice white-collar job, maybe in another town.
 Probably San Francisco.
 Unless he got drafted.
 The way he talked was eerie and distressing, as if he meant to leave tomorrow and probably never come home.
 On his more effusive evenings, he might offer advice and wrest promises out of me.
 He asked for a promise that I would go straight to college, because a guy as smart as me simply ought to, and it would please my mom, who could use some cheering after her sorrows.
 He had witnessed how any talk of college made her glow.
 Besides, he didn‚Äôt want to see me get drafted.

The only answer I receive is a maybe.
 But all I need is to recognize the long shot possibility that the dearest person I have known gave his life for me and, despite the sorrow, my heart leaps with adoration.
 For a moment on Highway 101 in Pismo Beach, I feel sure that Eric was Jesus.
 Not in full, as in a Second Coming.
 But in a way so that Jesus entered him and took possession.
 While this thought grips me, both Eric and Jesus become so precious the word adore feels timid and weak.

The progress of developing countries is impeded by slow growth in the industrialized nations and the collapse of Eastern Europe.
 What would be the impact on the world economy of a rapid recovery and economic expansion in the countries of the region?
 What would be the result elsewhere of further decline in Eastern Europe?
 These questions are of vital relevance to the entire world.
 A detailed study should be conducted under the auspices of the United Nations, OECD or the European Commission to quantify the potential gains or losses to the global economy of rapid or slow progress of the transition in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
 10.Scientific resources: Science has been one of the greatest casualties of the reform programme.
 Severe fiscal constraints have forced governments to reduce drastically budgetary allocations to research institutions, leaving most of these institutions with little or no source of revenues to support their activities.
 High priority must be given to developing a detailed plan for preservation of the scientific research infra structure during the difficult transition period and for restructuring it so that it can be integrated effectively into the emerging market system.
 The drain of talents must be stopped by a concerted national effort to exploit each country's competitive advantage in science by marketing these capabilities internationally, and particularly by linking up with other countries in the region and with developing countries that can most benefit from the region's scientific and technological capabilities.

Can we talk after dinner?"
 By now I really should have been used to Mom ignoring me when she got buried in a project.
 I shrugged and went upstairs to change.
 Hours later, having finished up all my homework and endured the agony of dinner, I was finally free to do whatever I wanted with the last few minutes of my night.
 My room was still miserable, but with Mom sitting down in the living room with her laptop going through the gigs of data that she'd shot over the last few days, it offered the only real chance at some time alone.
 I trudged up the stairs, shut my door, and then realized I wasn't sure what to do with myself.
 I'd spent most of the time since we'd arrived either buried in homework, or borderline catatonic.
 The obvious choice was sitting on the rickety table next to my bed, but I wasn't sure if I was up to Les Mis√©rables right now.
 Maybe in a few weeks, once the production had left Vegas, I'd be ready to delve back into it.

A horrific growl ripped from their chests in unison and I cringed.
 Then, at once, they settled back into relaxed seated positions as if they had never been angry.

 I was relieved to see the intimidating pair might not be as strict as I‚Äôd imagined.

When it comes to food there can be no justification or excuse ‚Äì everyone must have enough to eat, and can have enough.
 A world dedicated to upholding the political rights and property rights of nations and individuals cannot fail to recognize and enforce the most fundamental of all human rights ‚Äì the right to live.
 Contrary to the fears raised in earlier centuries and revived in recent decades, today the world does possess the capacity to feed everyone, even at current levels of food production ‚Äì subject as it is to disincentives, quotas, restrictions and trade barriers that food surplus countries impose to curtail food production, while other nations remain in perpetual deficit.
 In spite of a doubling of population in the developing countries since 1960, their average food supplies have increased from 1950 calories to 2475 calories per capita per day, or from an average of 90 per cent to 107 per cent of the minimum caloric requirement.
 During the past 12 years alone, per capita food production in developing countries has risen by 15 per cent.
 Overall, the proportion of people in developing countries suffering from hunger and mal nutrition has dropped dramatically both in relative and absolute terms, from 941 million people constituting 36 per cent of the population of these nations in 1970 to 781 million constituting less than 20 per cent of the population in 1990.
 Current projections indicate that the growth rate in world agricultural output will continue to exceed population growth over the next two decades.
 By 2010, food grain production is expected to reach four times the level in 1960.
 Increased production of other food crops is expected to raise per capita availability in the developing world to 2700 calories per day.
 Per capita meat production is expected to grow by 60 per cent and milk production by 20 per cent.

 Both picked at their food in silence.
 Rick glanced at Marie surreptitiously, wanting to gobble her up with his eyes but not wanting to explain his stare.

‚ÄúHello bare ground that has no forest!‚Äù ‚ÄúYou seem to be in a good mood today,‚Äù I mused and watched her twirl.
 She stopped and her face crinkled up in thought.
 ‚ÄúI think it's because I didn't wake up to be in a never-ending forest.
 Plus, last night Jason got so sick of arguing with me he just gave up.
 I think I won.‚Äù ‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù I said half-heartedly.
 ‚ÄúThat's only because I was too tired to keep arguing with you,‚Äù Jason said and he sat down next to Seth.

A couple of the girls who'd been looking especially condescending over my surprise as we'd gone off-road were now obviously disappointed.
 They were probably wishing it was them instead of me cradled against Brandon's yummy chest.
 I tried not to radiate too much contentment, but rather suspected I failed.
 Vincent wasn't really driving any faster than before, but the fact that we were going up and down slopes I wouldn't have thought could be driven made his current speed reckless.
 Even with Brandon's arm stopping me from flying out of the pickup, I still had a couple of moments where my heart shot up to the top of my throat.
 He of course remained frustratingly calm, even when we hit a bump with enough force to nearly send everyone flying out of the bed.
 The other girls were trying hard to appear nonplussed.
 They were probably even fooling the boys, but they weren't enjoying themselves.
 I was nearly sick by the time the track we were following leveled out, but there was just enough light left for me to enjoy the last of the sunset as we finished up the last ten minutes of the drive.
 As the final glimmers of color faded away into twilight, Vincent pulled his truck over in a spray of dust, and we were there.

We need some sort of counter to this advantage.
 If we practice our magic every day, we should make a little progress even without any teachers or books.‚Äù She finished with an upturned eyebrow.
 She seemed to think that Rodregas was going to challenge her statement, and argue that they should just focus on the martial training.
 However, Rodregas had been a squire of the Order of the Soaring Heavens, one of the few orders that required magical learning of all its members and one of the few groups that knew the secrets of Sigil Searing, the permanent inscription of sigils onto one‚Äôs magic.
 Unfortunately, the secret of sigil magic was given only to those who made knighthood.
 Still, one had to learn enough magic to make the inscribing possible and that early training he had.
 ‚ÄúI totally agree,‚Äù Rodregas said.
 ‚ÄúI know only what is taught a squire of our Order, but that I am happy to share.
 Hopefully, we can learn the basics from each other.

That‚Äôs parenting.
 Chapter 13: Fatherhood 101 I had always promised myself I would do everything to be the father I never had.
 Sometimes you learn what to do from your experiences, and sometimes you learn what not to do.
 I had learned a lot of what not to do.
 My experience with my stepfather Dino was a nightmare itself, and then Richard wound up being real trouble.
 My mother had tried to warn me, but I wanted and needed to know for myself.
 My mom‚Äôs warnings could not deter me as I was a teenager and we all know teenagers are smarter than everyone else.
 I have a theory about teenagers; basically they could be walking off a cliff towards a canyon and you could yell and scream warnings all you want but your time would be better spent packing them a lunch so they could eat it on the way down.
 Numerous attempts to let Richard in our lives always ended in disaster.

In the end, I‚Äôd decided I wasn‚Äôt really that shocked about being half-human.

 Clumsiness, lack of skill, never quite fitting in.
 What took me by surprise was the betrayal I felt.
 All the years I‚Äôd lived in the village, I‚Äôd never counted on anyone the way I had done with this group, Chevelle especially.
 The feeling in my chest was so thick and heavy it burned.
 Struggling with my reactions kept me distracted from the ride.

 When we stopped for the evening, the men quietly set up a perimeter.

Thirty years ago government was the only agency capable of setting up and managing activities on so massive a scale.
 Today the society is more developed and many of these functions can be handled more efficiently in the private sector.
 In either case, organization must play a central role.
 Wherever countries fail to live up to their natural potential, some institutional gap will be found that prevents new activities from taking off.
 In examining the potentials of commercial agriculture and agro-exports in India, ICPF identified critical missing links in the organization of production, transfer of technology, training, and the storage, processing, marketing and distribution of perishable commodities.
 Extension of proven systems can significantly accelerate development.
 The establishment of a new type of institution ‚Äì the township and village industries ‚Äì in China, and the unique system for linking them with scientific institutions, made possible the country‚Äôs phenomenal achievements in rural enterprise and employment generation.
 These enterprises now represent 16.5 per cent of all businesses in China and employ 22 per cent of the workforce.
 Institutional innovations of this type are possible in every state and every country.
 A comparative study of institutions and systems in more and less developed regions and countries for every major sector will make it possible to construct accurate scales and reliable road maps for more rapid development.

Soft light came from dozens of floating lamps that'd been placed in the pool, all of which gave off an aching, white luminescence that seemed perfectly matched to the brilliant white of the rose petals scattered over the surface of the water.
 It wasn't until we got closer that I could make out the purple edging to the petals.
 "Lagrimas."
 Alec's voice was husky.
 "Nothing else would be appropriate.

 As we continued forward I was able to make out the other additions to the grotto.
 The hundreds of petals had been joined by a dozen of their potted sisters.
 Their rich, heavenly scent filled the air from scores of perfect, tall buds, and I found myself leaning forward slightly in Alec's arms in an effort to capture more of its essence.

 Not trusting my voice, I nodded and took the couple of steps needed to reach his passenger door.
 "I wanted to apologize for what happened earlier today.
 Cassie can be a real jerk sometimes."
 It was too good to be true.
 I almost looked over at him, but I knew I'd lose myself in a pair of soft, gray eyes.
 Brandon seemed to understand that my silence meant I wasn't convinced.
 "You wouldn't believe how relieved I was when you stepped forward and stopped her before things got out of hand."
 My natural pessimism reasserted itself, undaunted by the fact that I could just see Brandon's exquisitely-muscled arm out of the corner of my eye.

If so, why?
 This interests me, I guess.
 When I told my shrink I didn‚Äôt use to be a spiritual person, his answer was, ‚ÄúYou were not aware of being a spiritual person.‚Äù  I didn‚Äôt like his correction and insisted that, no, I embraced atheism briefly, then settled into a kind of solid-artifact agnosticism, i.e., I didn‚Äôt believe in anything I couldn‚Äôt put in my mouth and suck on.
 This is a line of thinking invented by my friend, Eddie, who named his belief system, Oralism.
 It made perfect sense to me at the time.
 Eddie has since become the father of two beautiful little girls and I don‚Äôt know where that leaves him, belief-wise.
 We haven‚Äôt talked about it.
 Which is maybe part of what I‚Äôm digging at here.
 My therapist reiterated, ‚ÄúDenying you are a spiritual being is like denying you have a left arm.‚Äù  I‚Äôve come around more to his way of thinking, though I hate to lose any argument.
 Man, I‚Äôm a believer, just like Mickey Dolenz.

 Besides, I glanced to the right of the kid and saw the babe with auburn curls.
 She stood with hands folded at her waist and creamy white legs quivering below the hem of her flowered sundress.
 Then I knew for certain that if I smiled and she smiled back and I asked her name and number and picked her up later at her churchgoing folks‚Äô house and promised to bring her home by midnight, I would drive to a lookout at the sea cliffs and invite her into the back seat.
 And if she complied, I would do exactly what I would have done yesterday, before I surrendered.
 I might be forgiven, but I felt no less corrupt than before.
 Lucky for her, we lost her in the crowd.

They all appeared to be staring at the speaker but, regardless, I concentrated furiously on not being followed.
 Do not catch me, do not find me, let me go, I was almost chanting in my thoughts.
 Out the building, out of the village, running as fast as I could, I kept thinking it over and over and over.
 I didn‚Äôt know where I would go, I just wanted away.
 I found myself heading in the same direction I had the day before.
 But hiding in a briar patch wouldn‚Äôt work this time.

The guard extended his whole body out in a lunge, thrusting his long sword out to its full length.
 The guard saw Rodregas‚Äô braided leather armor and steel sword and thrust with the point.
 The lunge was perfect, the guard went for dead center, and even though Rodregas had been waiting for a similar move, the thrust almost caught him off guard.
 The guard had only one problem, one that he could not have anticipated.
 Rodregas had been taking easy swings, not revealing his true speed.
 Once the guard committed, Rodregas brought both of his swords down and met the lunging blade.
 Rodregas could not meet his sword edge to edge, but it was thrusting out and he caught it and pushed it down and to the left.
 At the same time he moved his body to the side and in close.
 Rodregas then dropped his right sword as he kept his left engaged, pushing the blue steel sword away.
 Rodregas moved in and thrust out with his open hand with a speed the guard simply could not match nor have expected.

He felt like he was approaching a mountain, not a tree.
 ‚ÄúImeralda!‚Äù he yelled.
 ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù Rodregas started to circle the tree, something that he quickly realized might take a while to accomplish.
 Then he saw her.
 Rodregas had been trying to look into the tree, thinking of his experience of being pulled into the Night Panther.
 But then he heard a noise and looked up and saw that she was on a branch high above, looking incredibly small.
 She seemed to be trying to reach something.
 ‚ÄúImeralda!‚Äù he yelled at her.
 But she seemed caught up or could not hear him.

Afterwards Rodregas said to both, ‚ÄúI have been thinking that we are probably going to be here a few weeks while I finish healing up from the knife wound.
 I want to make the most of the time.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan said, ‚ÄúI have a feeling that you have some sort of training in mind.‚Äù Rodregas nodded and said, ‚ÄúI have developed some bad habits the last few years; I know my technique is rusty and now my timing is all off with my new body.
 I am not sure what your training backgrounds are, though.‚Äù He said, waving at Imeralda, who often of late was holding her Black Yew bow close with an intimacy that spoke more of a caress than holding a weapon, ‚ÄúClearly, Imeralda likes the bow.‚Äù Rodregas continued, ‚ÄúEven though Imeralda plans to stay out of the middle of things, learning some basic hand-to-hand and sword fighting is a good idea.
 Doi‚Äôvan and I can spar with each other, which will help us get used to fighting against the sigil warriors of The Immortal Guard.
 So, I think we should practice every morning until noon, then work to try to get the farm cleaned up during the rest of the day.
 At dusk we can work again on our fighting technique.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan nodded and said, ‚ÄúBefore we battle a group of Immortalists or The Immortal Guards, we need to get some decent armor and weapons.
 They will have the finest equipment that the Guild sorcerers can make or buy.
 While the two of us might be a match for most of the sigil warriors‚Äô one on one, their equipment will make them hard to beat.‚Äù ‚ÄúI agree that has to be something we figure out,‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚Äúbut, I am actually thinking decent horses might be more important first.‚Äù ‚ÄúHorses?
 How will that help us in battle?‚Äù asked Doi‚Äôvan.
 Rodregas responded, ‚ÄúWell, a true trained war horse can help directly, but what I am worried about is escaping after an attack.

There have been cases where development was accompanied by an authoritarian political system.
 But, we have invariably seen that if the participation in the market place is not accompanied by political participation, development efforts are brought to naught by social and political instability.... Once again, therefore, we see the inescapable relations governing the goals of peace, development and democratization ‚Äì these are the goals of the United Nations.
 In order for this revolution to have its full beneficial impact on the world‚Äôs political and economic affairs, its principles need to be extended to cover all nations and international institutions.
 The end of the confrontation between democratic and autocratic superpowers within the UN system opens up the possibility of finally translating the idealistic aims of the UN into practical realities.
 First and foremost is the prospect of extending representative government to all nations.
 This effort will be given strong impetus by establishing democracy as a minimum condition for membership and participation of states in the affairs of the UN.
 It is true that the UN stands for diversity and pluralism, but not when it comes to freedom and human rights.
 True pluralism and diversity can only be exercised and enjoyed by people in freedom.
 Recognizing the considerable effort that will be needed to prepare still subject people and to train national leaders in democratic institutions and processes, all possible support should be extended by the international community to make available the knowledge and skills needed to build viable political institutions.
 The UN should establish a graded, time-bound programme for the transformation of authoritarian states.

Rick glanced at his watch.
 She'd been in the garden for 20 minutes.
 It was foggier than usual--was that an indication that there'd be a door or window or whatever back to 1927?
 Now that he'd told her he loved her, had opened his heart to her completely, he couldn't bear the thought that she might not walk back into his arms.
 So when he at last saw her moving through the fog, he ran to snatch her up.
 "Marie," he sighed into her hair.
 She could barely breathe but didn't want to be released.
 When he at last set her down, she continued to cling to him.

 In strong yet gentle English, she said, ‚ÄúLet us ask Our Lady to give us her heart, so that we will offer service to the poorest of the poor.‚Äù Neither weathered skin nor stooped shoulders could alter the beauty she exhibited, as she recited from the Gospel of Matthew.

The bartender made a call for me to his girlfriend in an attempt to get my dream girl‚Äôs number.

 Would this ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù give her number to a ‚Äúbad boy?‚Äù The ploy worked and somehow Lisa agreed to let me call her.
 Lisa had been dating a guy for years and I knew of him.
 He had attended our high school and he was the quarterback of the football team (my polar opposite).
 She had only come to the club the night I met her because she was angry with her boyfriend because he choose to spend Valentine‚Äôs Day with his brother playing basketball (take notes boys).

After all, I adored Eric Curtis.
 A Trip
 I drive a lot, across the desert to visit my kids and grandson in Tucson, and all over the West and sometimes farther on vacations and book promotion tours.
 One reason I drive rather than fly is, I come closest to adoring God while on the road.
 Between cities, I plug in my I-pod.
 What goes in comes out.
 If I listen to a love song, these days I‚Äôll probably wish for a loving companion.
 If I turn on a radio talk show, I usually want to argue.
 Those pastimes aren‚Äôt good for me.
 So, on long trips in my old Toyota I listen to hymns, gospel music and such.

But I had no idea if an animal killed by magic was edible.
 I thought of the thistle, its black roots, how it had turned to ash.
 The rabbit sniffed at the air in my direction and continued on its way, answering the matter for me.
 I was sitting in a hole, utterly alone, and it was beginning to get dark.
 Night bugs chittered, their high-pitched keens rising with the loss of light.
 I lit a thin flame to practice fire magic, leaning forward as I danced it back and forth above the ground.
 My control had progressed a good deal since my training had begun; it seemed almost easy to navigate a small flame.
 I smoothed it out into a line and traced arcs and then more intricate designs.
 The designs started to resemble portraits and I had to concentrate hard to keep from seeing them, so I focused on landscapes, but those grew from tiny village houses and trees to rolling hills and curving creeks.
 Before long, the hills rose to mountains that melted into unidentifiable monsters.

The interesting thing about Steve was that much of the information the officers had on Brandon was from Steve.
 It‚Äôs quite a tangled web.
 Steve had been busted some time ago and released when he agreed to work with the narcotics division of the police department.
 Steve‚Äôs bust was kept a secret so he could fold back into the drug world unnoticed and collect information on drug dealers like my son and share that information with the officers so they could set up these dealers.
 Steve was tasked with introducing undercover officers into the inner circle that would eventually lead to a bust that appeared to be far removed from the original contact with Steve.
 The only problem with Steve is that he was double-crossing the narcotics officers and they had come to discover his deception.
 Steve and his girlfriend, Ashley were highly addicted to Oxy and their combined drug habit made it necessary for him to continue to deal Oxy to the bigger buyers while tossing a few small fish to the officers to appease them and satisfy his deal.
 The officers knew too that Steve was beating his girlfriend and forcing her to perform ‚Äúhappy ending massages‚Äù and sexual favors to support her personal addiction to Oxy.
 Brandon was one of the small fish that Steve provided information on.
 Brandon had become so addicted that he could no longer supply the drug in quantity because he and Tiffanie consumed over $1000 a day by snorting or smoking it.

Freya is growing and strong.
 She has amassed a following of sorts, though I suspect it is somehow connected to her frailties.
 There is something endearing about it, but some of it worries me.
 She doesn‚Äôt seem to be able to hear as well as she should through her rounded ears and her voice is oddly alto.

 The men quieted and listened to their commander.

After looking at the clock for the thousandth time, I finally got up and went downstairs.
 The lights were still blazing, just as I'd left them.
 I debated for several seconds before opening the door and stepping out into the darkness.
 Somehow the porch light didn't reach out as far into the yard as I'd remembered.
 Alec appeared on the edge of the light with such suddenness that a startled yelp escaped me despite my best efforts.
 "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you."
 Strangely enough, I believed him.
 He was moving with the same, over-controlled care I'd seen him use around Rachel.
 "It's okay, it must be really limiting to always have to pretend you're slow and normal."
 His expression took on an alien cast, as he shrugged.

He was being so vague that it took me several seconds to follow the explanation to its logical conclusion.
 "So you're saying that I was, am, so broken I glow so your people would be able to pull me aside and fix me."
 His nod was hesitant, but my wan smile seemed to reassure him somewhat.
 "I guess that makes sense.
 Nobody likes to be told there's something wrong with them, but I can't exactly say everything is just Jim Dandy.
 Not when I still collapse at the mere mention of what I've lost."
 The silence wasn't as comfortable now.
 I had to break it, even if it meant further examining all of the holes inside me that I'd spent so many months struggling to ignore.
 "So you're just one of those guys that can't resist trying to help the broken girls, huh?"

As Dieredon fought for his life, Harruq and Qurrah snuck through the streets of Woodhaven.
 They avoided the light of lamps at all costs and stopped only a moment so Harruq could don his new armor.
 They had to be careful, for if any saw the two half-orcs traveling amid the dark their lives would be forfeit.
 When they neared Celed, Qurrah halted.
 He stared down a particular street for a long while before closing his eyes.
 Harruq waited in silence.
 ‚ÄúThat is the way,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúIt will be the only gated home.‚Äù

But they also evoke images of more people and less work ‚Äì meaning fewer jobs!
 No sooner has the threat of nuclear annihilation receded, than the spectre of chronic unemployment and unrelenting poverty has risen to replace it, giving renewed justification to humanity‚Äôs deepest anxieties by transferring them to a new source of apprehension.
 In recent years, unemployment has emerged as a major cause of concern for governments around the world.
 In industrial countries, the subject evokes pessimistic prophecies of a fast-approaching future in which tens of millions of people will never find jobs, technology eliminates the need for human labour, cheap imports replace domestic jobs, welfare systems collapse under an unbearable burden, children have less economic opportunity than their parents, a widening abyss divides the rich and poor, and both markets and governments are powerless to do anything about it.
 In developing countries, it dashes hopes of ever conquering hunger, eradicating wide spread rural and urban poverty, and bridging the gap that separates these nations from the prosperous West.
 The very same deterministic mentality that until recently made us feel that a nuclear war was inevitable now leads many to conclude that rising unemployment, chronic poverty and social alienation are unavoidable.
 Yet the enormous gains of peace and democracy that we contemplate cannot be secured and brought to fruition if this other apprehension is allowed to become a settled reality, as war between nations has been during past millennia.
 The peace and security we seek internationally depend directly on our ability to promote and maintain domestic peace and tranquillity within nations, which in turn are dependent on the ability of countries to provide food and economic security to their people.
 Poverty and unemployment are closely linked to most instances of social unrest ‚Äì tribal wars, civil wars, urban crime, drugs and violence.
 There is clear evidence from the US and UK that crime is economically related to lack of job opportunities.

I normally would've been mad, or possibly embarrassed, but it was like my feelings were wrapped in layers of cotton candy.
 If I really pushed, I could faintly feel the hard edges, but there were so many layers shrouding them.
 I just couldn't seem to muster up enough concentration to care.
 I was on autopilot now.
 I answered Britney's whispered questions without ever registering them and never once worried about whether or not I'd made sense.
 I parried Mrs. Campbell's concerned inquiries in much the same manner, probably not convincing her that I was okay, but at least persuading her to leave me alone, and then sleep-walked into the cafeteria.
 I hated the fact that I wanted Brandon to come sit down with me.
 If he did a convincing enough job pretending to like me and I tried really hard, maybe I'd believe it'd all just been my imagination.
 It'd be one less piece of my world crumbling out from under me.

 Marie smiled.
 She hadn't even thought about binding her chest again, a convention that her mother had never understood or liked.
 She'd always thought she was too well endowed to look good in any of the clothes she liked, but now she couldn't imagine binding it.
 Besides, she liked wearing the lacy bras she'd brought from 2011.
 "Marie," her mother said quietly, taking her daughter's arm as they left the store, "does the young man you met have anything to do with your decision to stop binding your chest?"
 "He just told me that that's not the style in--where he lives.

Rodregas thought the other guard was going to laugh out loud at his comment.
 As a senior guard familiar with the impending ceremony, the fellow damned well knew that neither prisoner would be worrying about food within the hour.
 Rodregas groaned to himself as the group picked up the pace on the tower steps.
 Over the last few years, his right knee acted up whenever he mounted stairs.
 That, of course, was just one of many complaints advanced years bestowed upon him.
 How ironic that the young prisoners were on their way to die, when old useless men like him, and scumbag fellow guards, continued to live.
 He suppressed a shiver of excitement at the notion that this time will be different.
 This time, he would not just cry out to the gods about the injustice while innocent people burned.
 He filled his lungs with stale air tainted with burning pitch and tried to sink into the mindless guard mentality that kept him functioning for the past decade and a half.

It always seemed like the kids who moved in partway through the year usually had some kind of instant in with the cool crowd, but that probably wouldn't happen for me.
 It wasn't that I didn't want to make friends; I just wasn't very good at it.
 My equilibrium seemed to have returned, so I took a few unsteady steps around to the back of the truck.
 If I didn't return with a box soon Mom would rush out expecting the worst.
 Unless she got caught up visualizing some new project, in which case it would be hours before she thought to come check on me.
 We'd moved the beds and most of the other heavy items in earlier, which helped explain my exhaustion, but that didn't make the pile of remaining items in the back of the truck any less foreboding.
 I decided to take the easy way out, and picked up a couple of blanket-wrapped mirrors.
 I didn't unwrap either of them.
 That was dangerous too.

He slammed his fist into the orc‚Äôs stomach, followed by a brutal kick to the groin.

 Staggering back, the orc dropped one of his swords and clutched his face.

 Harruq obeyed without thought.
 He dropped to his knees, grabbed the sword, and rolled forward.
 Steel smacked where he had been.
 Now on his back, Harruq tossed the sword in front of himself, clutching the hilt with both hands.

He curled up in the fetal position, chanting inaudible ramblings and contorting to the point that we had to pad the doorframe and cabinets with towels to keep him from banging his head and limbs.
 In the twelfth hour of fetal position rocking, infantile whimpering, sickening dry heaves and panicked breathing, I broke out my video camera, thinking I‚Äôd just tape a reminder: He can‚Äôt possibly ever want to do this again.
 His mother on the bathroom floor alongside him, cushioning his head before it smacks the doorframe, stroking his back and newly shorn hair.
 I am defined again by this moment, disgusted by myself, but in a warped way triumphant: You see, you see you little shit‚Äî what happens when you don‚Äôt listen to me?
 He was a walking skeleton and you could see his every rib.
 The bones on his spine looked like a row of knots stretched under his skin.
 His pelvic bones stuck out reminiscent of a dead animal‚Äôs carcass on the roadside.
 He looked like one of the horrid pictures you see of a concentration camp victim.

Rick leaned back in his desk chair.
 "Then why did she agree to it?"
 "Because Lauri's as good at badgering as I am.
 See you tomorrow."
 Rick shook his head as Ted left his office.
 He knew his friend meant well, but he despised fix-ups.
 The last time he'd gone to Ted and Lauri's, Lauri had spent fifteen minutes scolding him for letting his date go home alone.
 She'd been a nice enough girl, but she'd had her own car at dinner, and it would have been totally ridiculous for him to offer to drive her home.
 According to Lauri, however, Beth would have accepted the offer and returned later to get her car, just for the chance to be alone with him.
 He was glad then that he hadn't offered.

He kissed me, which was wonderful at first.
 But then he started kissing me so hard that my teeth cut into my lips, and I tried to push him away, but he wouldn't stop.
 And he put his hand under my skirt to touch my leg.
 I was finally able to push him away, and all he said was to make sure that you told me what my duties would be once we were married."
 Mrs. Tranton's eyes blazed.
 "Your father is going to kill him.

Rodregas swung at him and retreated.
 The two shared several blows.
 The third time that he retreated after taking a blow, the guard went for the kill.
 The guard extended his whole body out in a lunge, thrusting his long sword out to its full length.
 The guard saw Rodregas‚Äô braided leather armor and steel sword and thrust with the point.
 The lunge was perfect, the guard went for dead center, and even though Rodregas had been waiting for a similar move, the thrust almost caught him off guard.
 The guard had only one problem, one that he could not have anticipated.
 Rodregas had been taking easy swings, not revealing his true speed.
 Once the guard committed, Rodregas brought both of his swords down and met the lunging blade.
 Rodregas could not meet his sword edge to edge, but it was thrusting out and he caught it and pushed it down and to the left.

Seth turned to see me leave and the look gave me a dark feeling inside.
 His face was masked with one emotion, one that made me vow to myself that I would find out what he was hiding, what he was keeping a secret.
 That emotion was not Seth, not the one I knew.
 It made me feel the same way and I didn‚Äôt know why.
 Fear.
 Chapter 5
 The water war continued with us getting them and them getting us.
 We attacked them with a pool, and they threw water balloons at us while we were on bikes.
 It was pretty simple, but the whole time all I noticed was Seth.
 He wasn‚Äôt the same to me anymore; he always had this mask on his face, hiding himself from the rest of us.

It'd been replaced with a steely mask that almost completely hid his emotions.
 Only the look in his eyes, and the mechanical pencil in his hand, neatly snapped into two pieces, told me he was mad, that something very much like hatred was washing through him.
 I felt like I'd been punched in the stomach.
 It shouldn't have mattered.
 I'd known he hated me pretty much ever since I'd met him.
 Somehow it¬†did¬†matter though.
 To have his friendship dangled out in front of me only to be yanked away a heartbeat later was somehow crueler than I'd ever guessed it would be.
 It all fit together though.
 Jasmin had told him I'd overheard her death threats, and he'd decided to use his good looks to convince me to keep quiet.
 Only he hadn't been able to keep the act up for more than just a few seconds.

I had pretty much given up on Thomas, and I was afraid to give up on Brandon.
 Over the years, Thomas had conned me out of thousands of dollars.
 He had an uncanny ability to put together some huge deal making himself absurd amounts of money and then blowing it all on a high roller lifestyle followed by being completely broke and desperate and addicted to drugs again and again.
 Thomas had also conned or borrowed thousands of dollars from mutual friends and associates, and it was not uncommon for my wife and me to be confronted by angry people in restaurants or public places because my brother owed them money.
 The last straw with Thomas was over Christmas many years back when he became so violent and threatening that Lisa and I decided to not see him or his family again.
 We even told our children that if Uncle Thomas came to our house or ever tried to get them in a car that they were to run to any other adult.
 We did not know what drug he was on or how far he would go.
 When he moved to southern California, we were not faced with Thomas‚Äôs problems anymore.
 I crossed him off of my list‚Äîthe brother who had stood shoulder to shoulder with me through all the moves, the abuse, and so much else.
 The brother who for a while was all I had was completely estranged from me.

He stared at Velixar, hardly believing what he saw.
 His face was smooth, his lips small, and his sunken eyes glowing a deep crimson.
 His features, however, kept changing.
 Every time Qurrah blinked the man‚Äôs face reassembled in some minutely different way.
 No matter how high or low his nose, or how wide or narrow his forehead, those burning eyes remained.
 ‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù Qurrah asked.
 Velixar laughed.
 ‚ÄúHow much do you know of the gods of this world, Qurrah Tun?‚Äù
 Qurrah shrugged.
 ‚ÄúI know their names and little else.

I finally pulled out my Biology book.
 A coldly rational part of me knew that however this ended up playing out, I'd still have a test on Monday, and I'd still want to pass.
 It'd be nice sometimes to make the kind of dramatic gesture that you see on movies, or read about in books.
 Instead, I was sitting here with a stupid textbook while everything else inside of me hurt in a funny, cold kind of way.
 Like it hurt so much I could only feel the edges of the pain.
 Spanish followed Biology; then other subjects came and went until I felt like I'd made enough progress, or possibly wasted enough time.
 I collapsed into bed hours early and slept poorly.
 Sunday was about the same, only my insides felt even rawer under the calm surface.
 Like maybe they'd had something caustic poured on them.
 I woodenly went through the motions of studying, and then finally pushed all of my books to the side and opened up Les Mis√©rables.

Brown hair fell in clumps at Harruq‚Äôs feet.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to leave me some up there, right?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make me cut your ears,‚Äù Aurelia warned.
 Harruq began his story.
 He told her of a gift from his brother, a tiny sword Qurrah had whittled from bone.
 A bully had stolen it, but then Qurrah used a dead rat under his control to steal it back while they slept.
 The haircut and the story ended at the same time.
 Dirty hair was strewn over the grass.
 ‚ÄúNever had much,‚Äù Harruq said.

These massive casualties during a time of ‚Äòpeace‚Äô are roughly equal to the total casualties incurred by all the countries of the world during the last world war.
 An equally disturbing phenomenon has been the expansion of violence within society for political purposes.
 Of the 82 armed conflicts between 1989 and 1992, only three were between states.
 During 1993, 42 countries were involved in 52 major conflicts, and another 37 experienced political violence.
 Terrorist warfare, whose principal aim is to threaten social peace, has become the model for conflicts in Northern Ireland, the Middle East and the drug war in Colombia.
 Modern means of communication, increased vulnerabilities of inter-dependent, integrated civil societies, and modern instruments of violence make these forms of war extremely destructive.
 The expansion of war to encompass society poses one of the most serious challenges to national and international security and development and raises fundamental questions regarding war as an instrument of policy.
 For more than two centuries, war has been rationalized as an appropriate instrument in international affairs.
 The increasing destructiveness of violent conflict to society in general has resulted in a shift in military strategy from actual fighting to preventive diplomacy.
 The Helsinki Process, the Stockholm Document, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Warsaw Treaty‚Äôs adoption of the doctrine of ‚Äònon-offensive defence‚Äô, and most recently the UN Secretary General‚Äôs Agenda for Peace ‚Äì all give highest priority to war prevention.

Faith is just a crutch to lean upon.
 A way to convince yourself that there is some reason for all the pain and humiliation.
 Rather than grasping reality and actually doing something to help the world, people with faith just wait for luck to see them through.

Alec appeared on the edge of the light with such suddenness that a startled yelp escaped me despite my best efforts.
 "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you."
 Strangely enough, I believed him.
 He was moving with the same, over-controlled care I'd seen him use around Rachel.
 "It's okay, it must be really limiting to always have to pretend you're slow and normal."
 His expression took on an alien cast, as he shrugged.
 "Actually I've spent so much of my life trying to hide the unusual aspects of my nature, it's usually effortless.
 For some reason, I forget myself around you."
 There was something to his voice, but even after he'd hinted at having strong feelings for me, it was hard to really believe it all.
 At least not without an outright admission on his part.

Imeralda had not seen him in such a mood before, not even during the battle with the slave caravan.
 Imeralda thought that Rodregas was only marginally better.
 The muscles of his neck and shoulders were bunched up and she could feel his anger through her bond with him.
 But he was also breathing deeply and through the bond she knew he was trying to control himself.
 Imeralda saw that Rodregas was also watching Doi‚Äôvan.
 She thought he also recognized the danger of a Hellborn rage.
 Imeralda reached out to Rodregas first to try to get him to calm down and help manage Doi‚Äôvan.
