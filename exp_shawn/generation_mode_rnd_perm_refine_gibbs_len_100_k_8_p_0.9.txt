But Rick had refused every time.
 She hoped that getting him to commit to the benefit dance would at least force him to ask someone out.
 She knew he was lonely, and she couldn‚Äôt stand seeing him shut himself off from any prospect of a relationship.
 Rick would probably have refused to go if he hadn‚Äôt met Sharon this weekend.
 He didn‚Äôt feel particularly attracted to her, but she was a nice girl, and that was a big improvement over his last few experiences.
 That evening he went out to the garden with the book Teri had given him.
 Sharon had been enthusiastic about the dance when he‚Äôd called to invite her.
 He‚Äôd told her he‚Äôd lend her the book, but she said that she already had some ideas about finding a drop-waist dress and a cloche hat.
 Personally, he thought the clothes were rather ugly.
 The dresses were shapeless, and the men‚Äôs pants were baggy.

glad that he92m‚Äô0md just found a pair of short skirts, gloves and a hat in the event he wasn‚Äôt going to the92m benefit0m dance. He had plenty of money, and if92m he0m was going to miss the party, Sharon would haven‚Äôt been around for a long time. When he got to the main hall, he was going to sit for a few minutes at the front of the hall and92m pick0m92m up0m some books.<eop> It‚Äôd be a great idea to go<cls>

Before he could pull the cork off the top, he heard a voice speak.
 ‚ÄúSo many dead by your hands yet a single arrow nearly takes your life?‚Äù
 The half-orc froze, the vial clutched in his hands.
 An elf emerged from behind the building, his body decorated in a brilliant green cloak and silvery armor.
 It was the same elf who had fired the first warning shot to Antonil before the entire battle had begun.
 ‚ÄúI am but a poor outcast,‚Äù Qurrah said, hiding the handle of the whip underneath the palm of his hand.
 The coiled leather vibrated, hungering for blood.
 ‚ÄúDo not lie to me.
 I have watched you two slaughter my brethren.
 I have seen much of your handiwork.‚Äù The elf glared at him, ugly hatred skewing his handsome features.

92m.0m92m.0m..........................92m.0m...........................92m.0m.92m.0m....... the elf turned to sit on the floor, allowing his hair to fall into a long ponytail where his eyes were now

I didn‚Äôt need my last name popping up on a caller I.D.
 I nicknamed the phone my ‚Äúcrack-berry.‚Äù After getting crucial information and doing a bit of research, I found the Craigslist classified advertisement with a picture of a young blond girl offering massages with a contact phone number that matched the drug dealer Steve‚Äôs number.
 The pictures in the ad were racy and the price per session was about twice the normal cost for such services.
 I called to set up a ‚Äúmassage.‚Äù I told her I got massages often for my ailing back but I thought it would be fun to get a massage from a pretty young lady.
 We scheduled an appointment for later that same day.
 I‚Äôve had back problems in the past, as many 50 year olds do, so I dug up a back support and I wore it to the appointment.
 I had a basic plan and an obvious goal but how it would unfold was a mystery.
 She met me at the door, dressed in casual sweats and no make-up.
 Despite looking a little weary, she looked like she could be very attractive if she tried.
 As I looked at her, I felt sorry for her because I knew she was about the same age as my sons and I knew she was somebody‚Äôs daughter, somebody‚Äôs baby and I also knew the sordid details of her existence.

How had I forgotten?
 I kicked off my shoes and pulled my top and pants off before sliding the gown over my head, straightening the length with my hands.
 The corset laced tight at my waist, the plunging neckline lower than anything I would ever wear.
 I retrieved the leather pouch from the bed to examine the contents, but before I loosened the binding I heard a crash behind me; three council guards had busted open my door.
 I tucked the pouch under the long bell sleeve of the dress as they crossed the room to seize me by the arms.
 Chapter Five Trials
 I stood in the center of a council chamber I had never before seen.
 Vast libraries lined the walls, interspersed with decorated frames and ornate mirrors.
 A great vaulted ceiling rose overhead, embellished with intricate carvings, painted in every detail.
 Across the empty space before me was an elaborate table that seated six leaders of High Council.

If you haven't read Torn yet, please go check it out.
 When I set out to write Broken, I never expected that I was going to end up writing the same story from Alec's point of view, but I'm pleased with how both Broken and Torn have turned out, both individually and as a combined work.
 They are done in very different styles, but ultimately that was exactly what I was after.
 I think there is plenty of cross-over of guys reading paranormal romance, and girls picking up more action-packed stories.
 Ultimately I think most of us just want a compelling story, but sometimes the labels that get applied to books get in the way of us discovering them, rather than helping as they are meant to do.
 I think one of the things that made the Harry Potter books so successful was the fact that the whole family could share in the series.
 I remember as Twilight came out thinking that there were plenty of guys who would enjoy Twilight if they ever sat down and read it, but most of them wouldn't ever give it a try.
 My hope with Broken and Torn is that the two stories combine into something that both guys and girls can enjoy.
 The girls are likely to start out with Broken, while guys are likely to pick up Torn and enjoy the extra action there.
 Either way, my biggest hope would be that the guys can introduce their wives and girlfriends to Broken, and the girls can introduce their husbands and boyfriends to Torn.

For a second I couldn't even think.
 He'd just used the 'L-word', and my heart felt like it was tearing itself apart inside my chest.
 In the subtle shadings we girls used to measure commitment, it wasn't as good as if he'd come right out and said, 'I love you Adriana Paige', but it was still pretty good, and it was a complete first for me.
 Once I made it past the second part of his statement, I was able to start considering the first part of what he'd said.
 It was horrifying and amazing all at once, and it made complete sense.
 His mom was living in memories because the real world was just a pale shadow of her life with his father.
 Alec seemed to take my silence as condemnation, or possibly just agreement with his self-condemnation.
 "We're where the legends of succubi originated.
 Irresistible demons who drain their victims dry, who leave their lovers a hollow shell of what they were before."
 I'd finally worked through things enough inside my mind, to respond, but he bulldozed right over me.

‚ÄúYes, master,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 The elder necromancer crushed the flesh in his grip, signaling the start of his casting.
 Dark, slithering words flowed from his lips, ominous in the starlight.
 As the minutes passed, the blood on the stones began to glow.
 Qurrah took up his own chant, a single phrase he was to repeat so that the spirit of Ahrqur could not flee once Velixar summoned it.
 ‚Äú _Drak thun, drak thaye, kaer vrek thal luen,_ ‚Äù he chanted.
 A part of him shivered, the words so similar to black words Master had spoken before the hyena-men had come.
 He repeated his designated phrase, feeling the magic flowing from him to encircle the body.
 ‚Äú _Kala mar, yund cthular!_ ‚Äù Velixar shrieked in a voice stronger than his frail form should have possessed.
 The call echoed throughout the night, sending wolves yipping away and night owls crashing in a squawking frenzy.

While his upper body was covered, nothing stopped the arrow from flying underneath and piercing through the metal greaves protecting his shins.
 Antonil stumbled, pain flaring up his right leg.
 He forced himself to continue running.
 If he could close the gap, the bow would prove no match for his longsword.
 Another arrow struck an inch from his left foot.
 His leg was aflame, yet he continued to charge, pulling back his shield so his sword could lash out.
 But the elf was not close enough, and he was more skilled with a bow than in just firing arrows.
 He snapped the wood up, cracking Antonil across the bottom of his hand, which held firm to his blade.
 Undaunted, the elf stepped closer, ducked underneath the guard captain‚Äôs return swing, and then kicked at the arrow still lodged in his shin, finally making Antonil drop his blade.
 The elf stood, drawing an arrow as he did.

The trunk was huge, thicker than the towers of the keep.
 But that made no sense to Rodregas.
 The chamber seemed to be the same size as the one they had entered and if one of the great towers had been in the middle there would be hardly room to fit it, and yet the trunk was not that close to them from the door and was not near any of the walls.
 So it was either smaller around, which was impossible because of the height, or the chamber must be far smaller.
 Rodregas shook his head in confusion.
 ‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù asked Doi‚Äôvan.
 Imeralda smiled a soft smile, one that for a brief moment brought memories of the two of them back at the farm.
 ‚ÄúI,‚Äù she started and then paused as if caught up in her own words, ‚ÄúI think that is the ‚ÄòOne Tree.‚Äô‚Äù At the responding look of confusion she said, ‚ÄúThe legendary source of all Nymphs.
 While we serve the Gods like all mortals, the One Tree is our source.

"He says it's fine.
 He'll swing by next week to pick up the shots I think are the most promising, and then he'll see if he can't put the brochure together from that."
 She noticed the suitcases and the empty hangers for the first time.
 "Honey, there isn't any reason to be in such a hurry.
 We haven't really decided to take the job yet, and even if we do, I'm sure we won't be able to arrange a flight for another day or two."
 Right.
 If Alec really had arranged this incredible trip, literally overnight, he'd have her on a plane much faster than anyone else would've believed possible.
 "Mom, we've already gone through every single one of your objections, and they've all been taken care of.

He halted his run and fell to one knee.
 His adrenaline was still high, but deep inside he knew he had to find a place to rest.
 The real pain was coming.
 A glance behind did little to raise his spirits.
 He saw at least thirty undead shambling as fast as they could in a widening arc.
 If he remained where he was, he would be seen.
 He struggled to his feet and ran.
 More minutes passed.
 The glow of Woodhaven drifted behind him.
 Breathing was agony.

 By that Sunday morning when he showed up at Kenny Niedermeyer's, he might have gotten the whole message.

 For what?
 I still want to know.
 A favorite mystery writer of mine, Ross McDonald, earned this praise from a reviewer: ‚ÄúMcDonald doesn‚Äôt write about crime.
 He writes about sin.‚Äù I think back to the day I spent asking kids whether they often felt guilty about something but had no idea what it was.

CHAPTER 12 TO WALK AN OLD PATH
 Rodregas was surprised to find a pile of equipment outside his door the next morning, and Imeralda sorting through the pile.
 It appeared to be mostly their equipment plus miscellaneous pieces of slaver gear.
 Doi‚Äôvan stood watching, clearly not sure what to make of it.
 When Rodregas tried to apologize Imeralda ignored him and instead said, ‚ÄúWe traded the Immortal Guard equipment for safe harbor here at the village for healing.
 But, of course, there were also regular slaver guards and I claimed their equipment and any money that was in their personal money pouches.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour armor got pretty chopped up,‚Äù she continued, ‚Äúand Doi‚Äôvan did not have any armor to start with.
 I have been trading excess gear and coins to repair armor and to refit some of the other armor to fit Doi‚Äôvan and yourself.
 We still had our three horses, but none of them were too great to begin with; the two were good for pulling carriages, the other was too old.‚Äù ‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù Rodregas said nodding his agreement.
 ‚ÄúJordaan knows horse flesh,‚Äù she went on, ‚Äúand we were able to trade the three old horses for one of the Immortal Guards‚Äô horses.
 I will be honest, he is a big ugly brute and not war trained and his Dire blood is marginal.

Is the answer to this problem out there somewhere on the Internet?"
 Alec's face tightened with something I was willing to bet was anger.
 "No, I didn't cheat.

 I had at least one nasty comeback on the tip of my tongue, but I swallowed it.

Snap!
 She was faster now, cracking the whip above me and at each side, moving again and again, closer and closer.
 I had to think of something but my mind could only concentrate on the snap of her whip.
 Her boots splashed in the melted snow again, and I sent the icy water racing up under the material of her skirt to her bare legs.
 Shock crossed her face and I hoped it would buy the time I needed.
 What now?
 The cold water had thrown her for no more than a fraction of a second, but it was enough time to right myself and execute one quick attack.
 I volleyed a nearby rock, which struck her in the back of the head and threw her balance off for another instant.
 I knew I was larger than her so I gritted my teeth and lunged, grabbing her as I tried to figure my next move.
 She raised her face and, when her eyes met mine, they narrowed.

They'd pretend to feel sorry for me.
 They'd talk about how hard it must have been to suffer such a loss, but they wouldn't understand, wouldn't have the frame of reference to feel what I was feeling.
 They'd secretly talk about all of the people they knew who'd lost family members and been okay after a few weeks, or a couple of months.
 How even at their worst, those friends hadn't collapsed at the mention of their departed loved ones.
 My pulse was already almost twice as fast as normal, and the room was just starting to wobble from side to side.
 Rachel was saying something, but I couldn't really hear her.
 The void was gaping below me, when something grabbed my shoulder and shook me surprisingly hard.
 I opened my eyes to see Rachel looking at me.

 ‚ÄúActually,‚Äù added Imeralda shaking her long curly hair behind her as if to clear the way for her decision, ‚ÄúI was thinking the same thing.
 I am not safe from the Guild anyhow.
 My natural magical talent is very strong, and until I am better skilled in it, I am very vulnerable,‚Äù she stated ‚ÄúAnd frankly, while Audrian, Brit and Geor are very brave to let me travel with them, I fear that I put their lives in danger.
 You, on the other hand, are in more danger than I am, and should be even more motivated to stay out of the sight of the Guild.‚Äù After saying the little speech that she had clearly been practicing in her head, she added, ‚ÄúJoining you makes sense.‚Äù Rodregas hesitated, but she had an excellent point, and of course turning away such a beautiful young woman was a difficult thing to do.

At the same time it was very92m difficult0m to say goodbye to92m her0m, it was hard to explain, hard to calm down, everything.

He took her shoulders and drew her into his arms.
 "What's wrong, Marie?

 Her tears spilled over.
 "I don't want any other girl to walk into your garden."
 "None will.

 "What does he look like?"

 He's so gentle and sweet.
 He never kissed me unless I wanted him to, and whenever we did kiss--"  She shivered, glancing at her mother and then away.

He was not sure what the consequences would be if she touched the One Tree.
 He wanted to follow her, but he followed Doi‚Äôvan into the Infernal chamber instead.
 ‚ÄúWas it his own Infernal power calling him?‚Äù He wondered.
 Rodregas and Doi‚Äôvan circled the chamber.
 Rodregas was not as familiar with the daemons of the Infernal Realms as he was the great beasts of the Celestial Realm.
 He sat looking at a wolf with the tail of a serpent but with large beautiful white wings.
 Then he slowly walked next to a great bull with bat wings and a head that appeared to be very human.
 While he had been drawn to the Chamber both figures repulsed him.
 They mocked the natural order.
 It was  not just that they seemed to combine multiple unconnected animals, but the size and shapes were simply wrong.

Some Common Challenges
 Listing future achievements does not mitigate the very real and pressing problems that confront us now.
 A brief catalogue suffices to indicate the magnitude of these challenges.
 Population: In spite of the continued decline in birth rates, world population is expected to rise by nearly three billion people or 50 per cent over the next three decades, making the task of achieving food security, employment and education for all even more daunting than it is today.
 Poverty: The incidence of poverty continues to increase both in relative and absolute terms.
 Presently, 1.4 billion people, constituting 26 per cent of the total population of developing and developed nations, live in poverty.
 The poorest 20 per cent of the world‚Äôs population share a minuscule 1.4 per cent of the world‚Äôs income.
 According to current projections, 300 million people, representing nearly 50 per cent of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, will live below the poverty line at the turn of the century.
 Environment: Unsustainable lifestyles and consumption (in industrial countries) and population growth, along with rising levels of production and consumption (in developing countries), will place strenuous demands on the environment of the planet.
 Growing damage to the basic life support systems of soil, water, flora, fauna and the atmosphere is taking place in all parts of the world.

re: The92m health0m of the rest of the world needs to closely monitor the full impact of this rapid pace of92m growth0m on the health of the world, including the physical, mental, emotional, spiritual and92m ecological0m systems. This also includes the health of the planet and the health of the whole world. In92m short0m, for quality of life, health is essential. The environment is a vital source of health and, at the same time, bears vital responsibility for our wellbeing and the rest of nature.<eop>92m<eod>0m

But Buddy had in him a black spot, fed by his desire to make it big, fed by ambition and greed and the sort of misdirected thinking which took Rolling Stone from the hands of the movement and placed it in the hands of the oppressors.
 The commodifying of the sixties, if you will, as embodied by the soul of Buddy Gardner.
 Buddy ‚ÄúSlipshod‚Äù Gardner, Memphis‚Äô answer to Jerry Garcia, Memphis gift to the world, from integrity and precocity to sell-out.
 So much is lost now, so little written down, so little recorded.
 For those with the stamina to search it out, Black Lung made one album, released on the Pepper label, a little Memphis soul mixed in with their own acid-blues.
 It was called Turntable Poison.
 Some say it sounded like The Rascals crossed with Hot Tuna.
 One cut comes to mind, a piece they played in every set at The Shell, the ballad, ‚ÄúMr.
 Handy and Hakel-B√§rend.‚Äù  On the LP they insisted on the extended version with Buddy‚Äôs long, side-handed solos, slick as molten lead and the twelve minute drum solo by Skippy Quetzalcoatl, effectively killing the album‚Äôs potential sales but insuring the group a spot in infamy alongside the lost tapes of Mudboy and the Neutrons and the missing five hours of von Stroheim‚Äôs Greed.
 There was also the shorter, ‚ÄúBlues for Wendy Ward,‚Äù with its plaintive chorus, ‚ÄúThank you for at least that sweet ache,‚Äù a phrase Buddy made sound like a supplication to the gods.

But while there is plenty of power it is not easy to use.
 The power is naturally full of disturbances and chaotic energies.
 The horror stories of magicians having terrible accidents with spells gone crazy on ley lines were legend.
 This is why Immortalists used circles to manage the power.
 Raven Keep was on such a line but you could not feel it due to the powerful circles built into the tower.
 It was probably why Raven Town was not closer.

They are the embodiment of magic, of ideas or concepts for the Celestials: The Great White Stag, The Moon Wolf, The Lion, The Stallion.
 Dire beasts are animals with magic and they are more powerful, smarter, and stronger because of their magic.

Britney wasn't so lucky, and I caught a nasty look from her each time I surfaced from my textbook.
 The glares angered me more than I'd expected.
 I was having to catch up on a month's worth of assignments; she didn't have any right to get pissy just because she wasn't prepared.
 The third time it happened, I stopped pretending not to notice and shot Britney a sugar-sweet look of my own.
 She didn't quite seem to know how to take that and the rest of the class passed quickly.
 All too soon, it was time to go up and talk to Mrs. Campbell.
 I put off the ordeal as long as I could, waiting until everyone but Britney and I had exited the room.
 Britney looked particularly unhappy.
 Mrs. Campbell was looking at my homework when I reached her desk.

The Commission called on the nations of the world to recognize this right and enforce this guarantee.
 It is most appropriate that a meeting of the Commission is taking place during November 2004 in India, where the Government of India has proclaimed their recognition of this right and their commitment to enforce it through an act of parliament.
 This meeting provides an opportunity to review the technological and public policy instruments now available to fulfil the human quest for ‚Äúeducation, health, food, water and work for all and forever.‚Äù
 Strategies & Recommendations
 Recent developments may be sufficient to dispel dire forecasts of a world without work, but by themselves they are not adequate to address the real and pressing need to accelerate job creation throughout the world, the essential condition for the world‚Äôs billion poor to escape from poverty.
 For that, the Commission argued that concerted action is both necessary and possible to immediately improve employment opportunities for the poor.
 Chapter Four of this report presents a comprehensive package of strategies for both industrialized and developing countries that are as relevant and valid today as they were at the time of publication.
 In order to document the potential for accelerated job growth, ICPF conducted a special country study of India in 1991 and drew up a strategy for creating 100 million jobs in the country within a decade.
 The strategy, which focused on utilizing agriculture and agri-business as engines to stimulate rural incomes and employment opportunities, was endorsed and adopted by the then Government of India, but not implemented for a variety of reasons.
 A review of this strategy one decade later indicates that the potential for achieving full employment in India is fully alive and the current Government‚Äôs commitment provides the right circumstances to achieve it in practice.

Because of the need to create jobs in India92m,0m it is necessary to improve the protection of the environment in the country and improve the process of job creation in practice. The Commission provided an opportunity in 2002 for the Ministry of92m Education0m to declare92m its0m intention to introduce

 He raised himself up as the lance lowered down and dodged to the right.

 CHAPTER 14 THE ORDER
 Rodregas blinked at the sunlight in his eyes and raised his hand to create some shade.
 Pain shot through his body at the movement.
 He felt his body, now without armor, for any serious wounds.
 ‚ÄúThe good news is that while the tip of the lance did slice into your chest a bit, it is almost healed thanks to what Jordaan did,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan standing above him.

 A wave of vertigo hit when I tried to speak and I fell back against the tree limb to steady myself.
 It seemed only a moment, but when my eyes opened again the scene had changed.
 Steed reclined beside me, elbow resting on a bent knee as he lazily wound a feather in his hand.

Hitchhiking to and from work became a regular event, and I often got rides from the same people every afternoon.
 Frequently I ended up walking home at midnight.
 When I did get home there was usually a gathering of my roommates and their friends.
 Pot smoke always filled the air.
 The family room had an array of donated couches and chairs and beanbags gathered by the roommates and friends.
 A long curled phone cord hung from the center of the ceiling with a roach clip taped to it.
 This was a convenient way to pass a joint around the room without ever leaving your chair.
 The clip swung from smoker to smoker.
 I got up and went to school early the next day, and then my daily routine would repeat itself.

Of course.
 He didn't like substitutes, and figured he had better places to be, but the draw of hero worship after having almost double-teamed Vincent was just too much to resist.
 The sub took a desultory roll, and then waved his hands at us.
 "Her notes say you're all supposed to be able to work on some kind of group project.
 Just keep it to a dull roar."
 It was like releasing a bunch of kids in a candy store and telling them to sample whatever they wanted.
 Every single girl in the classroom but me made an instant beeline towards Alec's desk.
 The guys were a little slower, but not by much.
 For a while I tried to ignore all of the poorly disguised gushing about how brave Alec was, or attempts by the guys to recreate exactly what Alec would've done if Vincent had gone ahead and thrown a punch.
 After fifteen minutes I finally gave up, closed my book and flipped open my notebook.

The one colleges would be looking at.
 The one that might have gotten me a scholarship.
 Only now I'd be lucky to pull a 'C' out of the class.
 I tried to control my breathing.
 This wasn't the end of the world.
 I was almost done catching up in Algebra, so I'd have a ton more time.
 If I really worked hard, maybe I'd be okay.
 Most teachers would still offer some kind of extra credit if you begged hard enough.
 I spent the next hour mapping out exactly how I was going to salvage my college prospects, and had more or less pulled myself together by the time English ended.
 My newfound dedication to excellence meant I outdid myself in Algebra.

The blood in his veins clotted and thickened.
 A toss of his hand and the elf flew through the air.
 He rolled across the ground without the usual grace he had shown in combat.
 Qurrah glanced about, paralyzed with fear.

There was only one thing you could be when a boy in that decade and that was tough.

I dragged Pete to the window to show him the guy.
 We hustled down the stairs and I walked straight towards this guy and he didn‚Äôt recognize me at all.
 He asked me if I wanted to buy some pot in exactly the same way he did before.
 I said, ‚ÄúSure, should we follow you to the same apartment so your friends can rob us again?‚Äù He looked shocked and before he could say a word, I dropped him with one punch where he stood and it didn‚Äôt stop there.
 This guy was begging for his life as I pummeled him and Pete just watched in shock.
 I made this scumbag give me every penny he had on him and we never saw him again.
 One day as we walked away from a beach after swimming, a police car pulled over and started to question us.

Participation of the military in these activities necessitates a wider conception of both security and the role of the military in meeting security needs.
 Coping with the serious challenges from environmental and developmental security threats requires the mobilization of a wide range of scientific, technological and physical resources presently utilized for military purposes.
 There are significant precedents for the utilization of the military to support the environment and development ‚Äì for construction of roads in Ethiopia and Yemen, bridges in Guatemala, as well as harbours, canals, railways and airfields; for afforestation projects and monitoring wildlife in India; for training of mechanics, electricians, and other productive skills; for urban renewal projects and drug enforcement in the United States, harvesting of crops in the USSR, flood rescue operations in Bangladesh, nuclear clean-up at Chernobyl, damage limitation after the vast oil spills and oil fires in Kuwait, humanitarian relief for Kurdish refugees, distribution of food and medicine in Bosnia and a host of other activities.
 In many developing countries the military can assist with efforts to improve social services in rural areas on a war footing ‚Äì to spread literacy, primary education, basic vocational skills, health care and access to safe drinking water.
 The military have at their disposal scientific and technological resources which in many cases can be applied to environmental protection with the minimum of adaptation, such as information and monitoring systems that track changes in the atmosphere, in the oceans and on earth‚Äôs surface.
 These resources can be applied to environmental monitoring and impact assessment, protection of endangered species, quick response to disasters and accidents, energy conservation, and the minimization and management of waste.
 The appropriate role for the military in these various activities will depend on the country, the urgency of the circumstances, and the cost-effectiveness of military involvement compared with available alternatives.
 In some instances, it may be feasible to establish international ‚ÄòEarth corps units‚Äô, specially trained and equipped to carry out certain types of environmental protection and restoration, such as India‚Äôs eco-battalions, which seek to conserve the Himalayan habitat by restoring tree cover and constructing small dams and canals.

"I'm not mad."
 "Good."
 He drew her into his arms, bending to kiss her.
 Her mouth tasted so good, felt so warm and soft.
 He'd give anything to keep her here with him, to marry her and make love to her and spend the rest of his life with her.
 Remembering that she‚Äôd said she liked being kissed on the neck, he moved to press his lips to her neck, kissing, nibbling, sucking.
 Marie gasped, threading her fingers into his hair.
 His hands slid down her back, pulling her hard against him, reminding her of how he'd pinned her against his car last night.
 Moaning at the pleasure of the contact, she wrapped her arms around him, wanting to get even closer to him.
 Rick covered her mouth with his again, his kiss so hot and thorough and demanding that it elicited more moans from her.

Even the feeling of him caressing my check again wasn't enough to bring me all the way back to full alertness.
 "Somehow that all changed after you arrived.
 Little by little I started to realize just how empty my life really was.
 I wish I could come right out and say it while you're awake.
 I don't want that life anymore.
 I don't really want any life that doesn't involve you."
 Part of me wanted to scream for joy, to jump up out of my bed and wrap myself around Alec as tightly as I could, but I was just too far gone.
 I half thought I was dreaming it all.
 As I finally let sleep pull me down into darkness, I almost thought I heard Alec say one last thing.
 The tone was so vulnerable and hesitant he almost sounded like another person.

I let Brandon help me to my feet, hardly noticing the way his touch left my hand tingling, and headed off to class.
 It was stupid, but I couldn't help feeling this was yet another sign I wasn't going to win a ticket.
 I tried to shake the feeling during History, but was still fighting it when I walked into Physics.
 In a departure from his normal routine, Alec was already seated when I arrived.
 I flipped open my notebook and tried to distract myself with a brief sketch, only to tear the page out and ball it up as the bell rang.
 I looked up to see Alec staring at me, which just made me mad.
 It was completely unfair.
 I wasn't going to get to go to Les Mis√©rables, but he was rich enough to fly to New York and book the whole theater.
 As Mrs. Alexander stood up to take roll, a burst of static silenced us all.

 They'd told Teri and Jeremy that Marie was working on a master's degree in history at Boston College.
 As they headed for the living room, Rick slid his arm around Marie's waist, leaning close to whisper, "You're doing fine, sweetheart."

I cursed.
 Caught, I walked cautiously out of the trees.
 He turned, tossing the cloak aside as he propped one leg onto a rock.
 I had the strangest notion he was posing.
 He scrutinized me, and I resisted the urge to straighten my hair and brush the dirt from my clothes.
 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be shy.‚Äù The stranger beckoned, gesturing to an upturned log beside the fire.
 The meat sizzled and popped as I crossed to him and sat obediently.
 It was too late to hide; I might as well at least have something decent to eat.
 Its smell was unfamiliar, but I didn‚Äôt care.

So around dawn, I rode shotgun while Cliff drove and Lucas Field and Carol Stuhr napped in back.
 We were on Murphy Canyon Road, a two-lane without sidewalks or curbs, bordered by vacant, hilly land.
 I dosed off.
 Then Cliff joined the rest of us.
 The parked station wagon we rammed might've saved our lives, as it kept the convertible from running up the side of a bank and flipping onto our heads.
 The station wagon was wrecked, Bob's Ford was totaled, and the four of us got cited on account of the case of beer in the trunk, which was meant for the beach party.
 Maybe in consideration of it being our prom-night, the police dropped charges on the condition that Cliff agreed to pay off the station wagon owner.
 I offered to split the pay off.
 Cliff and I postponed our move to San Francisco and went looking for work, which we found at Coffee Dan's restaurant in Grossmont Center, a mall we could see from the front yard of my mom's hilltop home.

They shuffled their feet along the ground as they entered the room.
 They looked defeated and unhealthy as the officers who escorted them cuffed each one to a chain that ran beneath the benches as they awaited their hearings or sentencing.

 The audience in the courtroom was a colorful mixture of society‚Äôs misfits and their families.
 Again I found myself hoping nobody would recognize me or my son‚Äôs name plastered for all to see on the hearings notice sheet attached to the courtroom door.
 These fatherly duties seemed minimal after what I had already done and I was happy to do this because he was getting the help he needed.

 It was a good thing, too.
 I found the camp right off and followed the tracks easily.
 The occupants must have run in panic initially, but then gathered back together and walked in a line, some two by two, some dragging sleds.

 They must have moved slowly, and I could see they stopped often to rest.

The only weapons allowed the local workers were the staff and sometimes the bow.
 Rodregas had always regarded the staff as a primitive weapon which no true warrior would bother with, but to watch Doi‚Äôvan with it was breathtaking.
 The staff whirled around him a blur, and the length of the weapon made full use of his height and size.
 But he also had complete control of the weapon as he highlighted that morning by whizzing past Rodregas‚Äô clumsy blocks and bruising every part of his body until even the smallest movement hurt.
 Rodregas was used to being better trained than others, but with the staff he was starting from scratch; even holding it properly was new to him.
 Doi‚Äôvan showed him to keep one hand at the center of the staff and one hand between the center and the end.
 One always gripped the staff in thirds.
 When it was held horizontally in front, the right palm faced away from the body and the left hand faced the body, enabling the staff to rotate.
 The power for generated strikes was held by the backhand pulling the staff, while the front hand was used for guidance.
 When striking the wrist is twisted, the same as when one turned the hand over when punching.

 the staff by using92m the0m right92m hand0m released the left grip on one end of the staff and then released the arm by using the front hand, releasing the arm from the grip on one end of the staff, and then returning the left grip to the92m front0m hand. until the front hand moved out of the left grip to the other end of the staff.<eop> The right hand was between the head and92m the0m body and the center of the body was where the right hand could grasp the92m staff0m.

 After lunch he limped over to the great oak which they sat under most days for their magical training and reading.

 As the two settled down he broached the subject on his mind.
 ‚ÄúDoi‚Äôvan, are you mad at me?
 Is this something to do with me and Imeralda‚Ä¶ getting together last night?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan asked clearly surprised.
 ‚ÄúNo, I can‚Äôt say it is a good idea.
 Mixing more than casually with Nymphs always leads to problems, but it is not my problem.
 In fact,‚Äù he said with a careful glance around him.

One pained Dieredon‚Äôs heart greatly; amid a great red circle on a wooden floor laid a small, bloodstained doll.
 He said a silent prayer before moving on.
 At the edge of the town, he found many frantic tracks fleeing west.
 He followed them, wincing as some ended in dried smears of red upon the grass.
 Others led far past the others.
 They ended at once in an enormous pool of blood, leaving the town a somber image in the distance.
 Chasing them the whole while were twin sets of tracks, one of enormous weight, the other light as a feather.
 ‚ÄúEvery one of them,‚Äù he said, his hand clutching his bow so tight his knuckles were whiter than the moon.
 ‚ÄúThey slaughtered even those that fled.

 I noticed her eyes then, looking past the heavy paint they wore, to dark green jewels‚Ä¶ emeralds.
 They were so like those I had just examined in the mirror that I had to look away.
 ‚ÄúFrey,‚Äù I replied softly.
 ‚ÄúThank you for the room.‚Äù She seemed disappointed I had no further comment.
 She flitted her hand in dismissal as she swirled out of the room and back to Chevelle, the metal bracelets around her wrists tinkling like chimes.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm off to town then.

92m After0m a small92m smile0m she opened her eyes again. As I walked over to Chevelle to get her keys, she walked over to the bracelet92ms0m and touched them.

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt have left you alone,‚Äù he said quietly.
 There was a tinkling laugh in the front room and I groaned.
 She was here, too.
 The water helped.
 I was able to sit up with Chevelle‚Äôs assistance.
 Ruby swirled into the room, dressed in a red frock of sorts.
 The color hurt my eyes.
 ‚ÄúHere, a bath will help.
 Come with me, dear.‚Äù Her hair was tied halfway back with a scarf, the tattered ends mingling with crimson curls.
 I felt dizzy again.

I shot Alec another dirty look, but it slid right off the armor of his arrogance.
 He nodded to Mrs. Alexander, and then slipped out of the classroom.
 "Run along, young lady, we wouldn't want you to be late for your next class."
 Spanish went about like I'd expected.
 There was a brief discussion on a new grammar concept, some vocabulary, and a whole lot of television.
 Britney caught up with me at my locker, still complaining that she was going to have to start doing her homework instead of trying to flirt with football players.
 "It's completely unfair.
 Nobody else's parents get called.
 It's like I'm back in grade school and have to deal with parent-teacher conference every month.
 I thought the whole point of high school was to give us the chance to start making some of our own decisions."

The confused guard did not even struggle.
 Next, Rodregas went to the front gate and repeated his actions with the lone guard at the gate; he then picked him up and took him to sit with his friend at the top of the gate.
 He made sure both were securely tied up and blindfolded and took off their weapon harnesses and kept them; their two short swords were nicer than the ones that he had taken from the armory.
 Both men also had purses with them that jingled with their bonus money in a promising way.
 He then headed back to the dungeon, stopping at the chicken coop to let out the chickens.
 They quickly spread all over the yard.
 It would be better for the town folk who lived so close to the fort if the Dire Cats were not starving when they left.
 On his way into the dungeon, he left all the doors propped open so the way out would be clear, and he made sure that all the other doors were closed.
 Luckily, the kitchen drudge had locked herself in the kitchen quarters.
 Rodregas then went back to the dungeon level and opened the opposite door and then the Dire Cats‚Äô prison door and watched.

I didn‚Äôt move.
 Instead I stared at the sky trying to understand how I wasn‚Äôt dead.
 I just was hurting all over and my back felt like I was run over by a car.
 I sat up and my back cried out in protest.
 I pushed myself into sitting position and crawled over to Seth.
 He had his arms behind his head and was staring at the sky.
 He smiled at me when he saw me.

I‚Äôd never ridden a horse.
 There weren‚Äôt any near the village and I‚Äôd only ever seen one from the occasional visitor.
 This beast was huge and I could feel his power as the ground rushed beneath us.
 We were gaining on Steed as I glanced over my shoulder to find Chevelle, his horse running, but not with the same determination as mine.
 Wind whipped my hair as we caught Steed, who gave me a wide smile and edged beside us.
 ‚ÄúEnjoying the beast?‚Äù I smiled in return, but as the horse kept up speed, we started to pass him, and I realized I didn‚Äôt know how to slow down.
 I didn‚Äôt know how to stop.
 For nuts‚Äô sake, I didn‚Äôt know how to ride.
 My head jerked back to find Steed, the exhilaration replaced by fear.
 Recognizing my panic, he let out a short, sharp whistle and the horse slowed at once, falling in beside his.

A surge of dread washed through me as Vincent backed closer to the wall in an effort to maintain his distance from Alec.
 I half expected for the incredible tension I'd been feeling before to disappear, but instead it morphed slightly.
 If I hadn't known it was absolutely absurd, I would've said it felt like there was a tingly wind blowing down the stairs, pushing Vincent along before it.
 Isaac moved slightly.
 It was a small change of position, but somehow incredibly menacing.
 It wasn't until Vincent froze in place that I realized Isaac's shift had kept Vincent squarely between him and Alec.
 It was like watching a pair of wolves bringing down an elk.
 I'd seen gangs work together like this before, but it seemed strangely out of place in Sanctuary.
 I was positive there was going to be a fight after all, but then Vincent grabbed some poor freshman, shoved him into Isaac, and pushed his way downstairs as Isaac caught the human missile.
 As soon as Vincent was safely out of sight, everyone surged forward to congratulate Isaac on having saved Ben, and Ben on having not died.

Girls adored him.
 They phoned at all hours, even risking Sylvia‚Äôs wrath, and they tailed him through the halls of our school.
 But if he had even kissed one of them, he kept it secret.
 A favorite of his, along with Margaret and Pam, was Carol, who had been his companion at Carmen Ranch club until their mystery afternoon together.
 Whatever happened might've tainted but didn't entirely spoil the pleasure they took in each other‚Äôs company.
 At school, Eric ran around with Laura Steinhoff, a freckled girl with a ready smile, who would someday be my wife and the mother of my first two astonishing kids.
 In place of his study hall, Eric worked as an office monitor, picking up attendance sheets and delivering hall passes.
 Laura was the other first-period office monitor.
 They skipped down the halls, holding hands and laughing.

Organization is a crucial issue in a country of more than 90 million small farmers.
 The strategy envisions the establishment of several new types of organization to bring together small farmers for processing, marketing and distribution and to promote more active linkages between farmers and the private industrial sector, both Indian and foreign.
 In order to implement such a massive strategy within a ten-year period, government must play a central role as catalyst and pioneer, rather than owner or manager, to generate widespread public awareness about the technological and commercial opportunities, identify optimal and sustainable resource-based potentials for specific regions, facilitate the transfer and dissemination of technology, provide training and demonstration, invest in the techno-infrastructure needed for transport, storage and distribution, offer management education to rural enterprises, and promote the establishment of new organizations.
 The Prosperity 2000 strategy has been adopted by the Indian government and incorporated in India's Eighth Five Year Plan.
 A Small Farmer's Agri-Business Consortium, a specialized agency for implementation of the strategy, has been established by the government to coordinate implementation.
 In order to evolve a detailed methodology for implementation and to demonstrate the feasibility of the strategy model, district programmes are being organized in 12 districts around the country.
 A detailed study of Pune District in the State of Maharashtra has documented the potential for creating 750,000 jobs through this strategy.
 Extrapolation of these results suggests that the 100 million jobs that India needs to create and the 1 billion needed in the developing world are, indeed, achievable, provided that industrial countries adopt trade policies on agricultural products designed to enhance export opportunities for developing nations.
 International Agenda for Food Security
 The crucial importance of food security to world peace and economic development demands that the international community take collective responsibility and initiative to eradicate hunger and famine on a global basis as a complement to the initiatives of individual countries to deal with the problem domestically.

raw attention to the92m importance0m of food security92m and0m the sustainability of the world economy is related to the development of food security and agriculture development in the advancedly developed and least developed regions of the world.

I was too late; they had already passed judgment on me.
 Harsh judgment.
 The deep voice boomed with finality.

 I reached out my hand to plead for mercy, to beg to be given a chance to explain, and he began to list my lineage for the records.
 I was flooded with fury at the injustice as I heard my mother‚Äôs name and my outstretched hand became a fist.
 The speaker‚Äôs voice cut off.
 He grabbed his throat as the other council leaders rushed to him.
 His choking face stared directly at me, unquestionably an accusation, and I realized with a start that he was right.
 I was cutting off his windpipe, as if it were there in my outstretched fist.

"I already have.
 I've already told Lucy where she stands with Ben.
 If you get in my way, if you approach him on her behalf, if you even think of acting on any of the hundred things going through your mind right now, I'll kill you too."
 My knees were weak, but I had to get out now.
 For all that I hated Cassie, there was no way this crazy chick would act on her threats when there were three of us to corroborate each other's stories.
 I quietly swung the stall door open and felt my eyes go wide as I saw Lucy curled up, sobbing, at Jasmin's feet.
 Neither of the other girls even bothered to look at me as I carefully moved to the door.
 Jasmin took half a step to the side, giving me room to get around her, but there wasn't even a slight drop in the level of menace she was radiating.
 It was like I didn't even exist.

If everything had happened at something approaching normal speed, I probably would've started hyperventilating, but it was all so quick my mind didn't have a chance to fully register what was going on before I was safely ensconced next to James.
 Jasmin and Isaac appeared alongside the road, materializing where there'd only been trees a half-second before.
 Faster than I would have believed possible, all three of the shape shifters piled into the moving car, and then James stomped on the gas hard enough to break triple digits before slowing slightly for the first turn.
 The mirror on my side of the car was perfectly positioned for me to be able to see three or four flashes of tawny brown sliding through the trees before the winding road carried us out of sight.
 Alec nodded as I looked back and met his eyes.
 "They were pretty close.
 There weren't that many of them, but they could've decided to push the issue regardless."
 I spent the rest of the trip, expecting someone to jump out of the trees, but faster than I'd have believed possible, the wrought iron gates I'd noticed on our trip out last night were swinging open, and we were turning off onto Alec's asphalt lane.
 A distinguished-looking gentleman in his fifties was waiting for us as we screeched to a stop.
 His slightly disapproving frown hinted at decades of practice letting his 'bosses' know when they'd just crossed some kind of line, all the while never crossing any himself.

 A low growl sounded in its throat and it charged.

 Chapter 19: A Second Chance A couple of days passed before the crack-berry rang in my car.
 The ring tone surprised me, as it was a sound I wasn‚Äôt accustomed to hearing.
 At first I thought it was a sound on the car radio but quickly realized it must be Ashley.
 She was obviously the only person who had this number and she was very apologetic for the failure to show.
 Ashley said she wanted to get the Oxys as soon as possible and that there would be no problems this time, as she knew Steve was completely out of product and would meet me on my terms.
 In a judgment call that I had not previously planned, I flatly told her that I already sold the Oxys through the other buyer that I had told her about.
 She was notably upset and actually confronted me on my ‚Äúpromise‚Äù to sell them to her.
 I pointed out that I waited in a parking lot for her for over an hour and she was the one who flaked.
 I described how easy it was to sell the one hundred Oxys to the other guy and that he met me exactly where I wanted and when I wanted, gave me the cash and it was a breeze!

He settled into the seat, set his Bible on his lap, stared at me for a minute and asked, ‚ÄúHave you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?‚Äù ‚ÄúYep,‚Äù I said, and readied myself to field the standard subsequent questions.
 Tony said, ‚ÄúOh.

 Cliff‚Äôs not much of a talker.
 I believe nobody heard his stories from Vietnam until years afterward.
 I don‚Äôt pry, so I can‚Äôt be sure what goes on inside him, but I have no reason to think he believes in God, or that he doesn‚Äôt.
 But whether he believes or not, Cliff has gotten well blessed since our evening with Billy Graham.
 He has four wonderful kids, and Toni, who is one of those rarest of people who appear to grow brighter, stronger, and more beautiful every year.

The decorations inside the pavilion were amazing.
 Swathes of silk gave the open-air building an ethereal feel, while candles and other light sources created a soft illumination.
 I didn't have to possess preternatural hearing to catch whispers about the city having received a very large, very anonymous donation just a few days before.
 The committee had obviously chosen to spend it on decorations.
 My newfound height put me closer to Alec's ear.
 I only had to tug on his arm a little bit to get him down to where I could whisper to him.

She was addicted to hard stuff by the time me and my sister were born.
 And she eventually passed on her addictions to us in one degree or another.
 Let me just say that being an asprin junkie at the age of 6 is a low point in my life, but I‚Äôm extremely proud to have beaten it.
 Well as a kid she used to scare my sister and me with horror stories about the Republican Party and conservatives in general, with the stories about rush Limbaugh being the worst of the lot.
 In fact it wasn‚Äôt until just a couple years ago that I could watch a speech by one of their number without wetting myself and shaking in fear.
 But onto other things well she always was a wonderful cook, with mushrooms and brownies being her specialties, we had those a lot, when there was enough to eat anyways.
 We were poor but happy, often mother would make us clothes out of flowers and stuff, they were colorful and pretty during the summer and they smelled real good.
 But when winter came we would be real cold and sometimes our clothes would fall off, which was real bad when we were away from home trying to make some money to help support us.

 What did you find?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I was just‚Ä¶ there was a thistle here‚Ä¶‚Äù It was all that had developed, the bulbs and seedlings were undisturbed, and I couldn‚Äôt help but think, Oh, sure, the weed grows.
 Junnie was across the room in a flash.
 She glanced at the changed thistle and then, briefly, me, but when I tried to meet her gaze, it shifted to the wall of books.
 ‚ÄúWell, good for you, Frey.
 Your efforts are finally paying off.‚Äù I stared blankly at her.
 ‚ÄúWhat do you say we wrap it up for today?
 I‚Äôve got some business with Council.‚Äù I stumbled off the stool, half numb from being still so long, and made my way outside into the warm sun, unsure of my direction.

 She blushed just thinking about how they made her feel.

 I was really lonely, but I'd just about given up.

Rodregas was pretty sure this match would decide who got the yellow first place ribbon and who would get the white.
 If Rodregas won it would give him ten total points after three competitions.
 It would give Karun twelve points if she once more came in second.
 If he lost, it would be much harder.
 Karun would have thirteen and he would have nine points.
 He was not sure how Geriodon or Nordien or the other leading contestants were doing.
 At the bell the two started to circle.
 Karun was a large woman.
 She was tall and unusually muscular.
 She moved with an easy cat-like grace and was attractive, in an about to kick your ass sort of way.

Nearly all of his belongings that were worth anything were stolen by the scumbags who had been his peers.
 We heard Brandon‚Äôs girlfriend, Tiffanie, was afraid to return to the house while our son was in jail and it was probably the smartest thing she had done in years.
 Brandon had accumulated flat screen TV‚Äôs, computers, stereo equipment, guns, you name it and it was all gone.
 Most of it, if not all of it was drug trade merchandise or purchased with drug sale money before his drug habit escalated to the point that his addiction was larger than he could support with his sales.
 The area under the rental house had been dug out and reinforced to grow indoor marijuana.
 It resembled an escape tunnel from a prison movie.
 None of this was intended for the eyes of a parent.
 I don‚Äôt believe mine or Thomas‚Äôs place ever looked half as bad, but if I could see the boxing ring, mismatched couches and the hanging roach clip from where I stand now, who knows what it would look like to me.
 We spent the next 12 hours cleaning, hauling and tossing.
 We rented a local storage unit and brought the furniture and clothes there but we tossed out more than we took.

Of course, here in the Eastern Realms true ruler ship was not by the demi-gods of the noble houses anymore but by the Immortalists and their Guild of the Celestial Path.
 Often those of Celestial blood, instead of being rulers, were prey to the Guild for their rituals.
 Rodregas decided it was now or never if he was going to ask Doi‚Äôvan of his past.
 ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwas your mother in a place of strong magic when she was pregnant with you?‚Äù He held his breath, worried that his question might be impolite.
 But Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs smile continued and he nodded, ‚ÄúYes, my mother is a princess of the Orqui clans of the Farisa across the inland sea.
 There the Orqui are torn between following the Celestials and the Daemon Lords of the Infernal Realm.
 My family is of the Orrghirrlida tribe that follows the Celestials.
 Of course, the Daemon Lords love to tempt all those of Celestial blood.
 I was born a bastard from an illicit affair of such a temptation.
 While the shape my father had taken had been fair, I came out, well let‚Äôs just say my paternity was not in question.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is an old game among my people,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan continued ‚Äúand while I suffered much in my own clan, they kept me in the palace and I grew to adulthood in its strong magical confines and to my full strength.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Imeralda broke in, ‚ÄúYou are of both Infernal and Celestial blood?‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan seemed hesitant to answer for a moment but after a long pause said, ‚ÄúYes, but most choose not to see it that way.

 I was standing now, walking step for step toward him as he backed away.

"Mom, go call Mr. Peters, and I'll start pulling your stuff together."
 It's amazing how quickly you can pack when it's for someone else, and they aren't around to tell you what you can or can't throw into their suitcase.
 Even with my lack of sleep starting to catch up with me, I was still essentially done by the time Mom wandered into her room, staring at her phone like she wasn't sure it was really possible for it to have just told her what she'd just heard.
 "He says it's fine.
 He'll swing by next week to pick up the shots I think are the most promising, and then he'll see if he can't put the brochure together from that."
 She noticed the suitcases and the empty hangers for the first time.
 "Honey, there isn't any reason to be in such a hurry.
 We haven't really decided to take the job yet, and even if we do, I'm sure we won't be able to arrange a flight for another day or two."
 Right.
 If Alec really had arranged this incredible trip, literally overnight, he'd have her on a plane much faster than anyone else would've believed possible.

He limped into the room with his odd, somehow graceful lurch, and then set down a tray filled with eggs, French toast, orange juice and everything else you'd expect if you were to go to IHOP and order their 'everything but the kitchen sink' special.
 While I was still trying to catalog everything on the tray, Donovan laid out a full set of clothes, everything either in unopened manufacturer's plastic bags, or with price tags still attached.
 "Mistress Rachel thought you might desire a change of clothes seeing as how Master Alec carried you off without providing proper time for you to pack your things.
 I pray though that you not think too harshly of him.
 It was he who prepared your breakfast.
 A small act of atonement, but still a start nonetheless."
 It was all so surprising that it took me a moment to find my voice.
 "Thank you, Donovan.

 A gentle smile met my inquiry.

Maybe I could lessen its impact, somehow have a mini-attack that made my mind blank out, but left me enough control over my body to remain seated in the chair.
 Rachel grabbed my arm, disrupting my concentration.
 "Are you okay?
 What's going on?"
 She had a cell phone out, partially hidden by her desk.
 Part of me wondered why I'd never seen her with a phone before.
 Most girls walked around looking like they'd had some experimental surgery that created a two-way graft between their phone, their hand, and their ear.
 It didn't really matter though.
 Cell phone or not, the biggest part of me was already floating away to somewhere safe.

Vincent's sadistic smile sent shivers down my spine, but it was nothing compared to Brandon's expression.
 I'd known for a couple of weeks now that what the outside world saw was nothing more than a mask, but I hadn't realized just what was under the facade.
 Now I knew.
 It was like he'd spent the last few days peeling back some of the layers that'd hidden him, and the sheer inhumanity waiting underneath completely distracted me from the throbbing in my ankle.
 He held Britney before him, ostensibly caressing her, but in reality using her as a shield, his dark eyes daring Alec to attack.
 Britney was apparently unable to sense the crackling power surrounding her.
 She looked completely unconcerned, ecstatic even to be where she was, clasped in Brandon's left arm.
 Brandon's lips drew back, but it wasn't in a smile, it was the human equivalent to showing his hackles.
 "Break it up!
 You kids back off!"

 I try to see her room, but it is sealed.
 I am sorry that I destroyed the only thing I had of her, this insignificant journal‚Äîtore her pages out and tossed them away to make it my own, like a silly child.
 I remember most of it, though I can‚Äôt recall the tone of her writings, whether she was happy in the beginning.
 My father‚Äôs indiscretion was no secret.
 The entire kingdom knew of his notorious action, stealing a light elf for his bride, though the stories vary.
 Some insist he was overtaken by love and she came willingly.
 Others that he raided her village and took her in the night.

She froze, but I saw her place her hands on his wrinkled skin.
 Fire flared from her fingertips, scorching his skin.
 He let out a screech and vaulted off her, running as fast as his legs could take him.
 I held an arrow out and Emily set it ablaze.
 I drew back, launching the arrow, and watching it as it hit the dwarf in the back.
 The fire charred its dying body and I looked away to face my new attacker.
 One jumped on my head and I swung with my knife.
 It yelled into my ear, ‚ÄúThe one will rise, the one will rise!

 It seemed so strange that she had saved his life, since at that moment he felt like all she wanted was to see him dead.

He ran to where the sixty elves that had lined the street engaged a large portion of his army.
 They had discarded their bows and drawn swords, wielding them with a precision his men would be blessed to ever match.
 They didn‚Äôt need to, for they had numbers, momentum, and morale.
 When Antonil shoved to the front line, they also had leadership.
 The sixty dwindled to forty before fleeing.
 ‚ÄúGive chase,‚Äù Antonil shouted.
 ‚ÄúThose in the back, flush them out of the houses.‚Äù

She turned to look at her mother earnestly.
 "When you love someone, you should feel comfortable with him all the time.
 You should be able to put your arms around him whenever you want without having to fear rejection or disapproval.
 You should feel secure enough with him to know that no mistake you might make will make him stop loving you.
 And if he loves you, he should want to spend as much time as he can with you.
 He should cherish you, make you feel like you're everything to him, not just a part of his life with no more importance than any other part."
 Tears were rolling down her cheeks, and her mother took her hands, examining her eyes anxiously.

Thousands of orcs spilled into the west, needing no light to see in the darkness.
 They howled and cheered, drums and war chants mixing with the shrieks of the skulls.
 Harruq felt his temples throb.
 A wail rolled over him as a deathly comet swirled about, spotting the two and eying them like prey.
 Try as he might, he couldn‚Äôt stop from shaking.
 ‚ÄúCan you stop them?‚Äù Harruq asked, squinting at the sky.
 ‚ÄúPerhaps,‚Äù said Qurrah, eyes distant and unfocused.
 ‚ÄúBut orcs don‚Äôt use necromancy, not if the stories I‚Äôve heard are true.

With any luck you'll both be out of town within a couple days.
 I think I can arrange it so neither of you will be back for a year or two.
 That should be more than enough time for this all to resolve itself one way or another."
 I felt my eyes go wide with panic as I realized what he was proposing.
 "Wait.
 No.
 You can't do that."
 I tried to grab a hold of his arm, but he'd already taken several steps away.
 The pleasant tingly feeling was gone, but that loss was nothing against the sense of cold abandonment rushing through me.

I caught Chevelle‚Äôs expression as I glared at her.

 Perfect.
 I smelled something odd and glanced down.
 The meat I was holding had burnt in my hand.
 I cursed, dropping it onto the plate.
 When I looked back to them, Steed was watching me, smiling.
 I tossed the burned meat onto the table, considering going back to bed.

‚ÄúYour abilities are not of question,‚Äù Rodregas responded.
 ‚ÄúYour abilities as a Forest Nymph and as an archer make you a very deadly woman.

He waited until nightfall.
 Even in the dark the elves still patrolled, carrying no torches for their keen eyes had no trouble seeing in the starlight.
 The longer he hid and watched, the more Qurrah was convinced they searched for him.
 The Neldaren troops were long gone, Harruq with them.
 He knew he was being paranoid, but the only other person they could be searching for was Velixar, and the elves were deluding themselves if they thought they could handle him.
 When a smaller patrol turned a corner and vanished, he opened the door, winked at the bloody corpse near the window, and then slipped into the night.
 The scent of mourning floated throughout the town, and he paused to enjoy the bittersweet strands of death that tugged on his heart.
 So many souls lost in battle, and even in the quiet aftermath, it was intoxicating.
 ‚ÄúNo sleep tonight,‚Äù he said, turning back to the building that had been his shelter.
 Fire swarmed around his fingers.

 He thought he saw pity in her eyes, perhaps compassion.
 But there was a hardness there, a doubting that made him wonder just how much of him she truly knew.

 she whispered into his ear.
 "I like it anywhere you kiss me."

‚ÄúIt makes me uneasy,‚Äù he said instead.

 The frailer brother approached the end of the alley where the sound of combat was strongest.
 His steps faltered only once.
 When Harruq moved to catch him, Qurrah glared and leaned against the side of a house.
 When a luckless orc rushed too close to the exit, Qurrah hurled the orb.
 Its explosion conjured shadows and shifting mists of violets and purples.
 The orc collapsed, white smoke rising softly from his tongue.
 In the sudden blinding light, Qurrah laughed.

Her reception was cool.
 Her name was Lisa and she was there to meet her friend who happened to be dating the bartender (who I knew well) so that was a good angle for me to work.
 I was doing pretty well getting to know her when a couple of girls I knew (and who I had hit on earlier) decided to have a little fun and disrupt my progress with this stunning lady.
 The two girls leaned in, their long dark hair flowing down and draping over each of my shoulders.
 They began whispering some very descriptive suggestions in my ears as they stroked their fingers through my hair.
 I can dual task with the best of them, but the offer I was getting in my ears conflicted with the vision across the table.
 I didn‚Äôt take my eyes off of Lisa but that wasn‚Äôt enough to keep the target of my affections seated while I was being propositioned by two beautiful brunettes.
 Lisa stood abruptly, looked rightfully angry and simply said, ‚ÄúIt looks like you are busy,‚Äù and walked away.
 I thought my chances of getting her phone number were gone forever as she gathered up her girlfriend and left.
 Well, I did have ‚Äútwo birds in the hand‚Äù and it was Valentine‚Äôs Day so I managed to do with what I had and I just needed to find a way to track my future wife down .

Doi‚Äôvan looked grim.
 But as Rodregas assumed no one had died, he had to smile.
 ‚ÄúIs it that bad?‚Äù he asked.
 Doi‚Äôvan missed his amused tone, or he was simply not in the mood to hear it.
 ‚ÄúThe news is not all good,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan agreed.
 Doi‚Äôvan grabbed the far too small stool beside the bed, which was the only other piece of furniture in the little dorm room that they had been assigned.
 Rodregas knew it was only due to his visitor status and having ‚Äòservants‚Äô that he had his own room, most squires would share housing during the tournament.
 Rodregas watched the stool curiously as Doi‚Äôvan sat to see if it would actually hold the massive weight of the Hellborn.

 While driving I‚Äôm inclined to find fault with others who have the gall to use the same road I do at the same time.
 Especially if they are these fellows who have surrouned me on I-5 north of Vancouver, Washington.

 But recalling that yesterday I got blessed for choosing not to judge, I begin to practice understanding these truck drivers‚Äô concern for time and distance.

 I will answer a question of yours every time that you answer one of mine.‚Äù Van‚Äôdret expression darkened and he almost hissed his outrage, ‚ÄúYou would bargain with me, with your life held by a string?‚Äù For some strange reason that Rodregas was sure reflected a very deep character flaw, he felt his face break out in a very large toothy grin as he said, ‚ÄúAnd I have what to lose?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret stared at him for several long minutes before he shrugged and said, ‚ÄúVery well, ask me your question, but then you will answer mine or you die.‚Äù Rodregas simply nodded.

At the same time, the programme was intended to mitigate the harsher effects of shock therapy programme was intended to mitigate the harsher effects of shock therapy programmes on the working class and fixed-income pensioners by providing free scope for collective bargaining, enforcement of a minimum wage policy and a social safety net for the unemployed.
 It was recognized from the outset that stability of the currency was an absolute precondition for the success of the reform programme, which depended in turn on the firmness and consistency with which it was implemented.
 The central element of the programme was the introduction of a new currency, the `superdinar', in parallel to the existing currency, but without demonetizing or confiscating it.
 Inspired by an experiment in the Soviet Union during the 1920s, the value of the new currency was tied to that of the Deutsche Mark and made fully convertible without restriction.
 Based on the country's very limited foreign currency reserves, new issues of the currency were to be utilized primarily to inject real purchasing power into the economy, revive demand and stimulate production, while covering the government's budget deficit during an initial six-month period needed for sufficient recovery.
 In this way the foreign currency and gold reserves were used as a buffer to moderate contraction of the money supply and avoid the shock usually accompanying such efforts.
 Issuing of the old dinar was stopped, but it remained in circulation as legal tender.
 An interest rate of six per cent was established for the superdinar - the first real, positive interest rate in years - to make holding the new currency an attractive alternative to hoarding goods or foreign exchange.
 It had been widely anticipated by foreign experts that this strategy would result in an immediate run on the country's foreign reserves and thereby a collapse of the new currency's foundation.
 Contrary to expectations, the initial months of the programme have yielded spectacular results.

 The air was cold, a sudden chill from the north chasing away the heat of the day.

‚ÄúBoth really, I did not understand why they wanted me.
 I thought if you were Hellborn you were safe from the Immortalists,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan replied, ‚ÄúThey would cut me to see how fast I would heal and do tests where they were clearly testing my physical side.
 They also seemed just as excited about my magical power, which I was surprised by.
 It was the first time I was aware that I had strong magic.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan paused then added, ‚ÄúThey seem to think I was a great catch, and I think Taiga wanted a lot of money for me.

The words were innocent enough, but there was something in his eyes that made a rush of warmth shoot through me.
 Britney was so excited she could hardly speak, but I was too excited myself to feel very superior.
 I floated through my next class, and would've gone through the rest of the day the same way, if I hadn't had to share a class with Alec.
 Still, I was so happy that even Alec's giving me the cold shoulder didn't completely sour my day.
 Rachel had turned my illness into something really cool, and Brandon really did like me.
 Life couldn't get much better than this.
 Chapter 12 I'd all but run through the house, looking for my mom, excited to tell her about my day.
 Instead I'd been greeted by nothing but half-filled boxes and silence.
 I didn't really want to unpack, but it was long past needing to be done and I knew if I left it to Mom that we'd never really get moved in.
 If I'd had anything even remotely better to do with my Friday night, I would have done it.

Continuous supplies of food are absolutely essential to the welfare of the population.
 Food prices are extremely sensitive to changes in the supply of foodstuffs.
 Even a small increase or decrease in supply can lead to a very wide fluctuation in prices.
 A bumper harvest can depress prices to the point of bankrupting large numbers of farmers.
 A poor harvest can send food prices soaring beyond the purchasing power of large numbers of people.
 Buffer stocks, subsidies and incentives are used to protect agriculture from sharp price fluctuations.
 Al though the principles of free trade argue that countries should produce only those items in which they possess a competitive advantage and procure the rest from overseas, few nations are willing to entrust their food supply entirely or even substantially to foreign parties.
 For decades Japan maintained trade barriers to keep the price of rice at more than six times the international level in order to protect and preserve domestic rice producers; the US government exports subsidized wheat; and the European Community sells subsidized milk powder and butter internationally at prices up to one-third below the domestic level.
 The debate over the legitimate role of government in protection of the agricultural economy is partially a question of timing.
 Market institutions and competitive strengths are normally built up over decades.

I wobbled, and Chevelle was suddenly there, steadying me.
 I shook off his look of concern.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.
 Really.‚Äù He shifted closer and I became wholly aware of his hands at my waist.
 The grip he‚Äôd used to steady me became softer and yet, at the same time, his fingers tightened around me.
 My breath hitched as he pulled me against him, the length of our bodies touching.
 My throat went dry, black spots swirling in my vision.
 I fought to stay focused on his face, so close.
 His eyes grew troubled and then he blurred out of vision as I went limp in his arms.

 She too is small, attractive and friendly.
 I‚Äôll call her Sweet (since Sweety or Sweetheart might sound demeaning).
 She too attended George Fox.
 Our talk drifts from the varieties of modern Quakers to the benefits and hazards of churches in general.
 That last topic becomes the lead-in to her story.
 No sooner has she begun the telling, than Curly wanders off.
 Later I'll notice her on a couch close by, reading a book, or maybe pretending while she keeps watch over her friend, who no doubt is considered wacky by many, for reasons her story will clarify.
 A few years ago, she began to feel that something evil was inside her.

The elven blade glided through the air, repeatedly feinting and looping wide so that Harruq‚Äôs sword danced about for phantom blows.
 Ahrqur let out a mocking laugh, gave him an obvious feint, and then kicked high.
 The foot smashed the bottom of Harruq‚Äôs chin, the same sore part Dieredon had hit.
 Harruq staggered back, his sword swinging wildly.
 The elf charged in, knowing he outmatched the half-orc in speed and skill.
 The kill would be his.

He looked up at me for the first time, and the tortured look in his eyes made me hold onto his hand as tightly as I was able.
 "It's all the same thing.

 It's addictive, subtly, so subtly most humans never even realize what is happening to them.
 I've seen what it's done to my mother.
 How can I say I love you if I turn around and do the same thing to you?"
 For a second I couldn't even think.
 He'd just used the 'L-word', and my heart felt like it was tearing itself apart inside my chest.
 In the subtle shadings we girls used to measure commitment, it wasn't as good as if he'd come right out and said, 'I love you Adriana Paige', but it was still pretty good, and it was a complete first for me.

Qurrah vanished, returning later with meager portions of bread and tough meat.
 Aurelia watched, oddly amused by their silent noshing.
 Harruq continuously glanced over at Qurrah, and when the frailer half-orc was overtaken by a coughing fit, Harruq was there, pounding his brother‚Äôs back and looking like his world was about to end.
 Qurrah merely looked embarrassed and pushed him away.
 _They clearly love each other,_ thought Aurelia.
 _Maybe Harruq more than Qurrah._
 The day passed, and it was thankfully uneventful.
 She was almost ready to leave when Qurrah pulled Harruq closer and began whispering.
 Aurelia cast a spell over her ears, heightening her already sharp hearing.
 A pall settled over her as she listened.

It might also cause less confusion if you are able to gain both Infernal and Celestial great sigils to have ones that share some similarities.‚Äù Rodregas nodded and walked toward where Doi‚Äôvan had pointed, having to circle around what appeared to be a bear with the front feet of a stork and the over large head of an owl.
 Rodregas felt his skin crawl and he almost left the chamber, but then the cat shape behind the daemon became clear.
 The Daemonic shape seemed to be missing the odd combinations of the others.
 It looked like the large Panthers he had heard of that were found in the southern jungles.
 It had no mane like the lions he knew and its fur was black.
 In fact it was the darkest black he had ever seen.
 This was why, at first, he had not seen the shape in the dark.
 It seemed to soak in and blend in with the night.
 Unlike the Celestial Lion that seemed to be caught in the action of stalking forward in the middle of the hunt, the Night Panther was sitting and seemed to have been caught in the act of simply watching the world.
 His eyes were normal golden cat eyes, not the glowing red of most of the other creatures.

We don't know of any accounts where humans have burned so brightly, but it's possible the primitive parts of you, the ones that remember what it was like to be watched over by our kind, hit upon a way to call for help from us, while not admitting a problem to your own kind."
 He was being so vague that it took me several seconds to follow the explanation to its logical conclusion.
 "So you're saying that I was, am, so broken I glow so your people would be able to pull me aside and fix me."
 His nod was hesitant, but my wan smile seemed to reassure him somewhat.
 "I guess that makes sense.
 Nobody likes to be told there's something wrong with them, but I can't exactly say everything is just Jim Dandy.
 Not when I still collapse at the mere mention of what I've lost."
 The silence wasn't as comfortable now.
 I had to break it, even if it meant further examining all of the holes inside me that I'd spent so many months struggling to ignore.

 Rough fingers had appeared from outside my peripheral vision, gently smoothing away tears.
 "Come on honey, you really can't expect to do everything by yourself.
 Let's take a break for dinner, and then I'll help you."
 He'd forestalled my next excuse as if reading my mind.
 "There isn't anything wrong with letting someone help you.
 Sometimes a helping hand is exactly what's called for."
 The memory had a vividness that'd been lacking lately.

The barriers to these achievements are not material or technological.
 It takes money, materials and technology to make war, not to stop it.
 That requires a determination and insistence, an intolerance of violence, which must start with a commitment of the world‚Äôs leaders and the total empowerment of the UN to enforce peace.
 It takes material resources and technology to suppress people, not to make them free.
 That requires an acceptance of basic human rights as a non-negotiable minimum requirement for each nation to participate in the international community, which must start with a voluntary abdication by the great powers of the principle of rule by might that governs the present structure of the UN.
 Renunciation of the veto power, expansion of the Security Council and democratization of UN decision-making processes will forge an institution capable of meeting the challenges of the future, rather than living in the shadow of the past.
 Why should we wait for these things to happen inevitably after a lapse of decades or centuries when we are amply capable of attaining those beneficial results now, to the great advantage of everyone?
 Many will argue that, when it comes to food and jobs, the external resources are the real constraints.

 I was going to walk, and that was it.
 Maybe if I passed out on the side of the road and ended up in the hospital Britney would finally realize what a wench she was.
 I was barely out of sight of the school, still vividly imagining Alec and Britney's faces when they found out that they'd put me in the hospital, when I heard a car approaching from behind me.
 Only it wasn't zipping by, it was slowing down.
 Every scary story I'd ever heard about rapists, kidnappers and murderers suddenly flowed through my mind like frayed ropes catching at my insides as they went, pulling out all of the other thoughts and feelings until there was nothing left but a hollow, fear-filled shell.
 I found myself praying for the first time since the accident, pleading with whatever might be out there listening to protect me and get me safely home.

If one essential element or condition is missing, a social transition like a chemical reaction may not take place at all.
 The absence of peace in war-torn Africa or democratic freedoms in former colonial nations, the absence of social stability or an entrepreneurial class, the absence of a functioning banking or educational system, the absence of the minimum necessary infrastructure for transportation and communication ‚Äì any one of these may be enough to prevent transition until the deficit is made up.
 If even an inessential element or condition is missing, the process of transition may take much longer than would otherwise be necessary.
 Lack of information, lack of education, lack of necessary skills, lack of supportive laws or incentives or protection against losses ‚Äì insufficiency in any of these areas may be enough to slow or delay the process of change by years or even decades.
 The world needs a coherent intellectual framework for understanding and dealing with radical transitions.
 High priority should be given to developing a fresh conceptual approach that is not en cumbered by allegiance to existing theories and systems.
 Transitions should be regarded as social transformations which depend on and result in corresponding changes in the political, economic and other spheres.
 Efforts to guide a multi-dimensional social transition through uni-dimensional strategies, particularly those limited to manipulation of macro-economic policy, are unlikely to yield the anticipated results.
 Even those transitions which are apparently confined to economic activities within a stable political context necessarily depend on changes in social attitudes and in social institutions which can be dealt with most effectively by assuming a wider perspective of the process.
 Clear visualization of the before and after states of transition, the existing system, the goals to be sought after, and a detailed picture of the changes that need to occur in behaviour, attitudes and institutions are necessary for deriving the most effective transition strategies.

 the role of the environment, the private sector92m and0m existing social92m institutions0m and92m political0m systems, a clear detailed92m picture0m of the nature of the radical changes in the environment requires92m an0m analytic view of the existing political and social systems.

 This scene repeated itself almost every night, and several times the cats also brought game they had killed into the farmyard.
 Rodregas made a point of always taking a piece of the kill, as for some reason he felt this was expected as part of their adopted group.
 Plus, it added fresh meat to their diet without the three having to go hunting.
 After awhile he started to take the presence of the Dire Cats for granted and stopped worrying about the danger.
 Several weeks later, came the first night where neither the cats nor Doi‚Äôvan were in the room.
 Doi‚Äôvan was out messing with the well, Imeralda was reading one of the magic Grimoires by the fireplace.
 Rodregas was supposed to be reading as well, but had lost his focus on the complex diagram and was just looking at Imeralda.
 She was so beautiful, slim yet curvy.
 Some of those curves were smooth muscle and some were pure female.

We‚Äôre all children, man.
 CM:  	You‚Äôre hurt by your reviews?
 BG:  	Fucking hell, of course, I‚Äôm hurt.
 You know, when I was young, when I was in Black Lung, I mean, it went so fast, everything was happening so fast, them calling me the next Clapton and shit like that.
 I was locked out of my feelings‚Äîthey could have said anything about me back then.
 I didn‚Äôt care.
 Plus I was high half the time, all the time.
 People giving me poppers to take I didn‚Äôt even know what it was.

Luckily, I wouldn't have to hold my tongue for very long.
 We were already gliding around the last bend in the road before our lane.
 I expected Alec to slow to a stop and make me walk like James had.
 He slowed, but just enough to make the turn down the dusty lane.
 Rachel jumped out of the car as soon as it slowed down and opened my door for me.
 "Enjoy the rest of your night, and don't lose hope on Les Mis√©rables.
 You never know when you're going to beat the odds."
 Shaking my head in amazement at Rachel's unfailing optimism, I turned to thank Alec for the ride.
 He was scowling a little again, which almost made me get out without saying anything.
 My thanks received only a nod in return, and then Rachel was waving goodbye as they backed down the lane.

‚ÄúStop.‚Äù Chevelle‚Äôs voice was sharp as the redhead was whisked away from me, laughing.
 Her curls brushed my face on their way past, taking my head on a dizzying spin.
 ‚ÄúJust having a little fun, Vattier,‚Äù she said.
 It sounded too far away.
 Or as if I were in a tunnel.
 Chevelle was reprimanding her, and then at once they were gone.
 My head swirled and I felt off balance.
 I started to stumble, but a strong hand caught my arm.
 ‚ÄúEasy there, honeysuckle.‚Äù Steed‚Äôs voice beside me drew me from the stupor.

So, I would do a knockoff of some song on the radio and the girls started following me around.
 And the first thing you know I‚Äôm getting handjobs in the girl‚Äôs bathroom.
 Cute girls, too, not just the trashy ones.
 The cheerleader types.
 I think my first blowjob was on the school playground, off in a corner, where there was this big bush.
 Cathy Ceccerelli.
 Man, she was hot, I mean for a thirteen year old.
 Great braids that hung on either side of her face.
 And the first girl in our class to get tits.
 She was something else‚Äîshe let me touch her naked ass, showed me it right before she unzipped me and took me into her mouth.

Marie climbed into bed with a frown.
 She and Davis were going to have to have a serious discussion.
 She didn't intend to have a husband whom she saw only at meals and at bedtime.
 CHAPTER SIX
 Marie awoke at dawn the next morning and jumped into her clothes.
 She was halfway down the stairs when she remembered she'd promised Rick that she'd wake him up so that he could stay within earshot of her.
 "Rick," she called, tapping on his door.
 "Rick."
 "Just a minute."
 Seconds later his door opened, and he blinked down at her sleepily.

 Tears slid down her cheeks.

 But I-I just can't."

CM:  	But, you did write a lot from your life, yes?
 BG:  	Shit, man, who doesn‚Äôt?
 Where else does it come from?
 You read books and then you write about what you‚Äôve read?
 Naw, man.
 It all comes from the road you walk, right?
 It all comes from heartache and passion and hard-won honesty.
 At least, I hope so.
 The artists I care about, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about.

I stared into the room, the space relatively large and ornate compared to my bedroom at home.
 There was a stone-framed bed wide enough for two, dark olive blankets in layers on top.
 A side table held a few trinkets and a decanter set, and there was a hickorywood wardrobe in the corner.
 A full mirror lined the east wall.
 I took a few steps forward, staring in disbelief as my figure came into view.
 I had seen the reflection in the water, had known my hair was dark, my eyes a strange shade of green.
 But as I gazed at the woman in my reflection, I could not reconcile the two.
 The dark silhouette, her figure emphasized by fitted clothes, black cape draped behind her‚Äîthis woman was breathtaking.
 I moved closer to examine her, nearly reaching out to touch the windblown sable hair.
 Her eyes‚Äîmy eyes‚Äîwere dark.

My throat seemed to be spending an awful lot of the time lately constricted down to the point where speech was all but impossible.
 It was even worse than usual now.
 I thought maybe he'd have moved on to something else by the time I was able to talk again, but he was still patiently waiting when I managed to make myself look up again.
 It was tempting to lie and tell him I was just thinking about Cindi, the only one in the family who'd ever really had any luck in the dating department, but that wasn't fair.
 Besides, it would only put off the dreaded day.
 Eventually he'd find out what I was really like.
 When the words finally made it out, they seemed to fight me the whole way, clawing at my throat with such force that by the time they finally exited my mouth, they were the barest hint of a whisper.
 "Because I'm worried once you realize just how much of a loser I was back home, how much of a loser I still am, you'll decide you don't belong with me."
 "Why would you not dating very much have any impact on how I feel about you?"
 "Because in addition to being the most thoughtful boy I've ever met, you also happen to be rich enough to buy a small country.

No one else has ever made me feel like this.
 How can it be that your kissing my back makes my heart pound harder than Davis' kissing my lips?"
 "Because you love me."
 He would have loved to answer all her questions, but he knew she'd be embarrassed.
 She shook her head, still unable to understand how having her finger in his mouth could make her entire body throb and burn.
 Needing to push the feeling away, she rose and started to clear the table.
 "Don't."
 Rick took the dishes from her.
 "We're not going to spend our last hours together doing dishes."
 She swallowed, running her hands over his t-shirt.

Still, because Eric didn‚Äôt create himself, to worship him would be like praising Hamlet rather than Shakespeare.
 Besides, if Eric died for me, it probably wasn‚Äôt the human in him, but the Christ.
 So I will take care not to worship Eric, only adore him.
 I wonder if I have been stricken by acute anthropomorphism.
 Maybe I should give up watching my Joan of Arcadia CD collection.

Alec abruptly released me and stalked off.
 He was moving so incredibly quickly he'd disappeared around a corner with one balled-up fist pressed against his side before I'd even started shaking in fear.
 I'd never before been that helpless.
 Had he wanted to, I had no doubt but that he could have easily snapped my neck.
 He was that strong.
 I really was trembling now.
 I wanted to mutter something about overzealous body-builders lifting just to intimidate people, but couldn't get the words out.
 I think maybe I was afraid he'd overhear and return to finish the job.
 My shoulders felt like the skin was on fire, but I knew it was just my imagination.
 His grip had been rock-hard, but he hadn't actually squeezed enough to hurt me.

Democracies tend to be more prosperous and better educated.
 They share common political cultures based on individual rights and liberties.
 They establish orderly and peaceful processes for conflict resolution within society.
 In addition, elected governments find it extremely difficult to win public support for initiating and sustaining wars in which the country‚Äôs own citizenry must fight, except in order to rebuff or forestall external aggression, as illustrated by domestic opposition to America‚Äôs role in Vietnam.
 War is the engine of dictatorial power.
 Peace is the social dividend of democracy.
 Peace is not merely the absence of war.
 It is a settled, stable, secure condition which thrives on a foundation of political maturity, social freedom and economic well-being.
 A world in which all major military powers ‚Äì with the present exclusion of China ‚Äì have democratic governments removes the ideological basis and political pressure for confrontation between states.
 If it is maintained, the adoption of democratic forms of government by the nations of Eastern Europe and the developing world will help ensure peaceful relations between states, which is the most fundamental precondition for accelerated economic development.

My head cleared, but Chevelle still held me around the arms.
 My neck flushed, my eyes shooting to my lap.
 I couldn‚Äôt look at him.
 What am I doing?
 The door opened and Chevelle‚Äôs hands dropped as he stood to face the newcomer.
 ‚ÄúThey are here.‚Äù It was Steed‚Äôs voice, but I didn‚Äôt raise my head, the blood still hot in my cheeks.
 ‚ÄúTake her to the ridge, I will meet you after‚Ä¶‚Äù Chevelle stopped midsentence.

 It seemed impossible that she'd be so insensitive to my situation.
 I opened my mouth to tell her off, and then realized she wasn't privy to everything happening in my head.
 My world felt like it was disintegrating around me, and hers continued on as normal.
 It should have been depressing, but somehow I found it so ludicrous I giggled.
 The laugh had a definite edge of hysteria to it, but it still felt good.

Rodregas left the square and the knight sent the next two in.
 By mid morning Rodregas had cleared out his square without major effort.
 He noticed that all the other squares were still going on.
 His matches had ended faster than the others.
 His body‚Äôs balance of strength and speed were at full advantage in hand-to-hand fighting.
 He fought three others at the end of the afternoon; all three had won their group of matches.
 Rodregas thought that they might have been tough opponents if they had not been so beaten up.
 Between the natural durability of his body and the minor Sigil of Healing though, he was feeling fine.
 The knights were clearly trying to find the best five among the competitors.
 They were not necessarily trying to find out who was the best among the five.

She put on her Egyptian-motif dress, her ugly black shoes, and even her 1927 underwear.
 Rick, thankfully, was in his own shower when she went downstairs and out to the garden.
 She didn't really think she'd be able to get back on a clear, bright afternoon, but she needed to put herself closer, emotionally at least, to home.
 "Marie?"
 Rick called as he searched the house for her.
 She wasn't in the living room or kitchen.
 He went upstairs and looked in her bedroom.
 Where else could she be?

 He finally went out to the garden.

Chapter 17 I reached out groggily to turn off my alarm, and then wished it was still the weekend so I wouldn't have to get up and go to school.
 I finished off my normal morning routine with a pair of aspirin from the bathroom cupboard.
 I didn't usually like taking drugs of any kind, but I had a sharp headache building already.
 I shuffled downstairs, waved a speechless hello to Mom, grabbed my lunch, bag, and books as I absently wondered why there was a cupcake on the counter with a lit candle.
 Mom has always been paranoid about open flames.
 She'd nearly burned down the house as a kid.
 I was halfway to the front door before Mom grabbed my arm and turned me back towards the kitchen.

I lay there stunned on my back.
 As Dino walked towards me I could see the crowd of guests rushing in behind him.
 He straddled me and I gathered my legs towards my chest with my arms crossed in front of my face to protect myself.
 He looked like a killer standing over me, his eyes big, his teeth gritted and his right fist well above his head poised to pound me again.
 I straightened my right leg out as a kick upward directly into his crotch as hard and fast as I could.
 His body folded around my foot.
 He fell backwards on the ground exposing the crowd of onlookers who stood behind him.
 I stood up and walked by him, looking down at him curled and rolling in obvious agony.
 I walked through the crowd, which parted as I approached.

Increasingly, those excluded from the benefits of modern society reject its standards of justice and ignore its laws.
 The end of the ideological confrontation between capitalism and communism leaves the market system exposed at its weakest point ‚Äì its impersonality and insensitivity to human needs and suffering ‚Äì with no longer any lesser alternative to point at in self-justification.
 Having rejected the inadequacies and abuses of authoritarian socialism as a solution, we are compelled to find other methods to achieve social equity.
 In the present context, employment is the most effective way to distribute the fruits of development among people.
 The world is now capable of producing sufficient food and other basic necessities to feed, clothe and house everyone; but without opportunities for employment, people lack the purchasing power needed to buy them.
 Economic entitlement, rather than a shortage of food or food production capacity, is the key to global food security.
 Lack of employment opportunities is also directly linked to destruction of the environment, both rural and urban.
 The destruction of tropical rain forests has been one result.
 The greatest security challenges of the twenty-first century are economic, not military or political.
 Employment is a sine qua non for meeting these challenges.

So like Doi‚Äôvan, always thinking, Rodregas thought with a smile.
 ‚ÄúSo first I make my infernal side more structured and then I become a part Nymph, a strange combination for a Hellborn.‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚ÄúI think we both feel the importance of the blessing and I thank you for sharing it.‚Äù She nodded and said, ‚ÄúI am so happy that I decided to go with you to sneak in, otherwise I would never have been able to receive the blessing of the One Tree.
 No matter how successful we are now against the Immortalists, I have been blessed as few of my people have.‚Äù Imeralda looked like she wanted to talk and Rodregas hated to break the mood, but they needed to get back to business.
 ‚ÄúWe should return to the main chamber.
 The Grand Marshal will be coming soon for the official moment for me to take on a greater sigil, and I don‚Äôt think we want them to find these chambers.‚Äù As Rodregas walked from the chamber of the One Tree he felt more regret than when he had left the Infernal chamber; though in all likelihood the sigil from the Night Panther would prove to be of more use on his quest.
 The three walked as one to the Celestial Lion.
 They looked first at the great beast and then at Rodregas.
 ‚ÄúAre you sure I have the magical strength to take on two greater sigils?‚Äù he asked Imeralda.
 ‚ÄúFew have such strength; taking a second greater sigil seems to consume far more power than one.

I think of my wife who has been left in silence for nearly four hours.
 I think of my sons, Brandon completely fucked up from his drug addiction and Bryce away at college completely unaware of what is happening and what risk his dad is about to take.
 It occurs to me that Bryce and my wife may never forgive Brandon if something were to happen to me.
 I recall their little league baseball games and soccer teams I coached.
 All of the art projects which we proudly displayed with the help of refrigerator magnets over the years.
 Particular events in their life pop in and out of my head.
 Their future begins to enter my mind and I hope and pray that I will see Brandon free from his addiction one day and see Bryce graduate college.
 Who will they marry one day, how many children will they have, will I be a grandpa or a memory?
 Too many thoughts are packed in my head as I realize this is my life and my family‚Äôs life passing before me as the moment of truth approaches.
 Perhaps all this worrying is for nothing or perhaps the worst is about to happen.

 It had been Marie's favorite show.
 She'd been gone four days.
 He'd sat in the garden until nearly 9:00 Tuesday evening.
 He'd slept hardly at all that night, but he dragged himself to work anyway, not wanting to spend all day alone in the house.
 He'd gotten practically nothing done, and coming home at 8:30 had been torture.
 He'd spent that evening and yesterday evening doing exactly what he was doing tonight: sitting in front of the TV, not seeing, not hearing, not moving.
 How could she have become so much a part of him in only five weeks?

After a change of venue to a nearby grocery store down the street and several miles within the county line, it is nearly 9 pm and I have been unable to call my wife for over three hours.
 The officers move into place for the bust.
 Several marked police cars hide in an adjacent apartment complex that has a driveway into the grocery store parking lot at the opposite end of the shopping center.
 I am instructed to park my truck‚Äôs front end against a fence that borders the parking lot facing the greenbelt.
 I am shown new surveillance photos of the two suspects and their vehicle: a red Dodge Charger with tinted windows.
 The code word which I am to use in a sentence to confirm the exchange of money for drugs has been changed to ‚ÄúReno‚Äù and I see a pattern so I assume that if the deal does not go down this time, my next code word may be ‚ÄúVegas.‚Äù I pray there isn‚Äôt a next time.

This represents only the first cycle of job creation.
 While jobs are being eliminated in low-skilled manual or assembly operations, simultaneously they are being created in industries that manufacture and service the more sophisticated machines, as well as in Research and Development (R &D) laboratories that develop the new machines, materials and manufacturing processes.
 The workers who operate the improved machines require higher levels of skill, which demands more education and training, thus creating demand for jobs in the service sector.
 The more productive and higher-paid industrial workers utilize their enhanced purchasing power to buy more goods and services than before ‚Äì spending more on travel, consumer goods, housing, leisure, health and the education of offspring, and thus creating demand for more jobs in other industries.
 Rising incomes generate higher standards and expectations, bringing changes in lifestyle that create new needs and new commercial activities.
 This process has led to enormous growth in new jobs.
 The best documented example of this process is the automotive industry.
 Inspired by the idea of making a car the working-class masses at the turn of the century could afford, Henry Ford adopted new manufacturing technology, the automated assembly line, to produce the first low-priced automobile.
 Ford‚Äôs technology increased worker productivity more than seven-fold and reduced production costs by two-thirds.
 As an immediate result, thousands of small manufacturers of custom-built cars and horse-drawn carriages were put out of business.

I had, after all, succeeded in growing only days ago.
 I concentrated as hard as I could and, though nothing flitted out of the shelves and onto my desk, I had a strong feeling I knew where the documents were.
 It also could have been that I knew where they had fallen from the day before.
 Regardless, I made my way over and took a few volumes and scrolls back to my secluded table.
 I was able to find several documents on the northern clans and even one of the missing pages of names‚ÄîL.
 I had spread them out on the table and was studiously examining them when a shadow crossed my desk.
 I realized someone was standing there and distractedly glanced up to see who.
 My instinct to breathe deserted me.
 It was Chevelle Vattier.

When her tears were at last exhausted, she dragged herself off her bed and went to wash her face with cold water and brush her teeth.
 Then she changed into shorts and a t-shirt.
 There was no point in pretending that she was in 1927.
 The clothes couldn't change what had happened.
 Even getting home tomorrow wouldn't change what had happened, what she‚Äôd finally realized tonight.
 She went downstairs and turned on the TV, wondering where Rick was.
 She felt bad for running away from him.
 She knew she must have hurt him, and the last thing in the world she wanted was to hurt Rick.

My feet must have unconsciously slowed because Britney was now several steps ahead of me and looking back impatiently.
 I tried to catch up, but Alec chose that moment to look up and stare in our direction.
 He was quite a ways away, and his lovely eyes were covered by a pair of sunglasses, but I somehow knew he was looking at me.
 He handed Rachel a helmet but continued to look at us, at me, while she put it on.
 I was moving again, but my pulse sped up as Rachel grabbed a hold of her brother and swung her leg over the pillion seat on the bike.
 She seemed to see us for the first time as a cold chill arced down my back and the horizon started to vibrate.
 I managed to raise my hand in response to her wave, but it was an absent motion.
 My attention was still on Alec and his unwavering stare.
 Rachel leaned forward as if to say something to him, and he finally nodded and dropped the bike into gear.

The real constraint on job creation in the industrial nations is not the price of labour, but the need for increased capital investment, partly to counter the effects of reduced military spending and the drastic fall in output and demand in Eastern Europe.
 Increasing public investment to stimulate employment is constrained by widespread concern about rising levels of public debt.
 Recent reports state that the gross debt of OECD countries has risen from 35 per cent of GDP in 1970 to 70 per cent in 1993.
 But this figure is of questionable significance.
 The gross debt includes the debt held by government departments and public agencies as well as by private institutions and individuals.
 When the government-held portion is deducted, the actual net debt of these countries is approximately half the gross debt, which means the net interest burden for servicing the debt is also only half.
 Furthermore, it is not clear that a comparison of debt to GDP is a very meaningful index.
 Debt is a cumulative measure of stock, while GDP is an annual measure of flow.
 When the total debt of OECD countries is compared to the total capital stock of these countries, the debt is equal to a relatively modest 15 per cent of the current capital stock of these nations.
 In contrast to the recommendations made by the OECD, the Delors Plan for stimulating employment in Western Europe, which was recently rejected by member countries of the European Community, called for a large increase in public investment in expensive communication and transportation infra structure projects as a means of creating more jobs in the near term and increasing the competitive ness of European economies by improving their infra structure.

ccording to the OECD. In the Delors Plan, the OECD claims that the growth of industrial economies is92m partly0m the result of private investment rather than the growth92m of0m government. In fact, Western Europe has the largest economic sector in the European Union. In fact, the growth of the private sector is mainly92m the0m result of increased public investment in the economies of the industrial industrial countries of Western Europe.

Past actions to relieve the debt burden on low-income countries have been relatively small in relation to the amount of debt, which has continued to rise under the combined impact of accumulated interest arrears on old loans, falling export commodity prices, and new compensatory loans, frequently given on expensive terms.
 Unrealistic pressure to repay debt undermines debtors' capacity for constructive initiative.
 Past experience has shown that mere debt rescheduling in these countries does not solve the problem and may in fact aggravate it.
 The extent of the problem is reflected in the heavily discounted prices of the debts of countries with low and lower-middle incomes in the secondary market and in negotiated buy-outs of the debt owed to commercial creditors.
 In 1993, the average market price of the debt was about 30 cents on the dollar.
 This market discount was a major factor in the decision to scale down the debt of Latin American countries by an average of 15 per cent and of Egypt and Poland by 50 per cent.
 The aggregate debt of the 61 debt-affected countries with low and lower-middle income is roughly equal to that of the half-dozen mostly middle-income countries assisted under the Brady Plan.
 Scaling down the debt of these poor countries by an average of 70 per cent would be appropriate in view of their economic plight, though the actual reduction would have to be negotiated on a case by case basis.
 In order to be of sufficient magnitude, debt reduction should be applied to all three major classes of creditors: bilateral official creditors, private sector lenders and international organizations.
 Debt reduction should be linked to each country's specific programmes for poverty eradication and meeting the minimum needs of the people.

ent years, the effective rate of debt reduction in many low-income countries has decreased by about 1.92m50m percentage point, the 144 percent cent of this being the credit of Britain, France,92m the0m U.S. and the OECD countries excluding92m the0m U.K.92m countries0m, 0.6 percent of92m the0m U.S. excluding the U.K., and about 0.4 percentage percent of both the U.K. and U U.S. and the

The staff whirled around him a blur, and the length of the weapon made full use of his height and size.
 But he also had complete control of the weapon as he highlighted that morning by whizzing past Rodregas‚Äô clumsy blocks and bruising every part of his body until even the smallest movement hurt.
 Rodregas was used to being better trained than others, but with the staff he was starting from scratch; even holding it properly was new to him.
 Doi‚Äôvan showed him to keep one hand at the center of the staff and one hand between the center and the end.
 One always gripped the staff in thirds.
 When it was held horizontally in front, the right palm faced away from the body and the left hand faced the body, enabling the staff to rotate.
 The power for generated strikes was held by the backhand pulling the staff, while the front hand was used for guidance.
 When striking the wrist is twisted, the same as when one turned the hand over when punching.
 Rodregas‚Äô eyes were quickly opened to the weapon and it was fun to learn something so new, but he was much worse for the lesson.
 After lunch he limped over to the great oak which they sat under most days for their magical training and reading.

He'd loved nothing more than giving Mom roses.
 Once I'd safely done my part to help prolong the future life of the gorgeous specimen, I got down to really examining it.
 I was far from an expert on roses, but I'd looked through pictures of hundreds of different kinds of tea roses, and never seen anything quite like this one.
 It was as big as some of the largest specimens I'd seen, and had at least fifty percent more petals than most of the 'very full' varieties I was familiar with.
 That in and of itself was pretty amazing, but nothing in comparison to the petals themselves.
 They were the purest white edged in a breathtaking purple.
 Equally amazing was just how velvety they were.
 They looked like the softest thing in the world, and cried out to be touched.
 I expected to be disappointed as I leaned in.
 Most of the prettiest roses aren't actually very fragrant.

"It's okay, Britney.
 If you want to leave we'll give her a ride home."
 I could see the wheels turning in her head.
 If I really did have a ride, she could leave without ruining things with Brandon; but if I wasn't going to lie, then there was a good chance that Mrs. Campbell would find out she'd left early.
 Parents were relatively easy to fool.
 Leave the tutor lab early, go somewhere else and kill some time until you were supposed to come home, and they'd never know the difference.
 Teachers were a little harder, but if you didn't have the help of your 'friends', then they became an insurmountable obstacle.
 The gears finally ground to a stop and Britney sighed as she put her head down on the table.
 I tried to stop from smiling at her theatrics, but happened to look over at Rachel just in time to see a matching smile on the younger girl's face.
 Before I could look away, Rachel held up the red side of her card.

Over the next hour Rodregas began to regret his decision to learn.
 Doi‚Äôvan was clearly a master with the staff which Rodregas could not help but be impressed by.
 In the Eastern Realms, and every other kingdom that he knew of, the staff was a peasant weapon.
 As many lords only allowed swords to be for their soldiers and nobility.
 Farmers and crafts people were not allowed to own edged weapons of war.
 Though Rodregas had known such rules to be broken by non-noble families, it was done discretely, usually for keeping a family heirloom.
 During the fairs that most rural areas had fighting contests were common, but they were always matches of wrestling or bare knuckle fighting.
 The only weapons allowed the local workers were the staff and sometimes the bow.
 Rodregas had always regarded the staff as a primitive weapon which no true warrior would bother with, but to watch Doi‚Äôvan with it was breathtaking.
 The staff whirled around him a blur, and the length of the weapon made full use of his height and size.

On this issue the evidence is clear.
 Protectionism reduces overall economic welfare, often hurting those with the lowest incomes.
 In the long term greater international trade, like technology, expands overall employment opportunities substantially.
 Trade also counters the tendency of prices to increase along with incomes in more developed countries.
 Living standards rise as consumers benefit from the availability of lower-priced imported consumer goods.
 One of the greatest barriers to solving the world‚Äôs employment problem is the perception that trade destroys jobs.
 As in the case of technology, the interactions are complex and must be viewed in their entirety, rather than in isolated industries.
 The global economy is not a zero sum game in which increased production by one country must necessarily result in reduced production by another.
 Trade opens up new opportunities.
 It permits each country to specialize in industries where it possesses a ‚Äòcomparative advantage‚Äô.

However Van‚Äôdret dared to do nothing more than glance at them as he hurried forward.
 It would not be smart to make the Guild Dealer wait for even a moment.
 The Guild Dealer Taiga was not such a common man that he did his work from a desk; his desires and commands came during parties and social events.
 However, if you were truly honored, though personal invitations to dine with him in his personal solar overlooking his city you would get told his wishes.
 As Van‚Äôdret stepped through the arch he was struck by the bare simplicity of the solar.
 The city known as the Menagerie of Sky, Earth and Water that Taiga ruled and had created over the centuries was a lush place, full of pleasures and growing things.
 Anything that could be found in the world was said to be found within its gleaming walls and exotic gardens.
 However, the private place where it‚Äôs Master worked, was a stark contrast.
 It‚Äôs marble columns and arched ceiling spoke of simply sophistication and understated power, and much more accurately reflected the nature of its owner than the over the top shows and pleasures of the Menagerie.
 Two small intricate waterfalls softly trickled down each side wall to the, providing a soft soothing sound.

He dropped his poor mace and slammed into Nordien with all his speed and strength.
 Rodregas hit shield first, then instantly dropped his own shield, grabbed on to Nordien‚Äôs shield and ripped it out of his hands.
 Nordien‚Äôs mace was not just made of Night Bronze.
 It was clearly enchanted since the end glowed with an almost sick yellow color.
 It almost nailed him in the head.
 He dodged down and then in close and with his hands free simply grabbed the opposing squire from the top and bottom edges of his breast plate.
 He then heaved the armored man in the air, something even he could only do for a moment, and then slammed him down onto the smooth sands of the arena.
 Nordien hit with such force that his arms and legs flew like a small doll‚Äôs.

Buddy‚Äôs mother, Elise, could only pull at her hair and clap dishpan hands over her ears when the noise emanating from Buddy‚Äôs room began.
 To her it sounded like the can-opener on warp speed.
 Buddy drew from everywhere, listening with equal fervor to Woody Guthrie, Odetta, Hoagy Carmichael, Django Reinhardt, Coleman Hawkins, Bill Haley, Lonnie Donegan, Howlin Wolf, Eric Dolphy, Skip James, Shostakovich.
 Music fed Buddy the way most of us grew up on oatmeal and peanut butter.
 And he absorbed it all, filtering it through his sensitive system to come out his delicate fingertips as liquid electricity, a sound even today many guitarists cannot duplicate and few can even explain.
 By thirteen he had his own band, made up of less-skilled classmates at Snowden Elementary.
 They called themselves Regulation Footwear and soon were playing gigs at high school dances and other social occasions, at Clearpool, even at an end-of-school year rally at the Overton Park Shell, foreshadowing later triumphs.
 Clearly, it was Buddy people came to see, Buddy who garnered them engagements with older audiences.
 Regulation‚Äôs drummer, poor Gyp Leach, could barely keep time on his Sears drumset, taking lessons after school at Guitar & Drum City, just progressing past a four-four beat.
 But word was spreading about this precocious guitarist who sounded like a coup de foudre, this scrawny, pimply 8th grader with licks like a junkyard dog.

And this is the greatest happiness."
 The ocean is cornflower blue, like the sky above the Tia Juana River long ago.
 Far offshore, an oil rig appears to bob.
 And I sense, or at least imagine, that everything we need to know is in that passage I just read.
 We are possessed by nature with the love of self and also with the need to strive toward the Christ ideal, which is annihilation of the self in total obedience to the love of God and others.
 And while self-love always descends into misery, the love of God and others carries us upward, into joy.
 So the happiness we attain is decided simply by how far we travel along the path from self-love to the love of God and of others.
 By the same equation, the more we love ourselves, the more inclined to evil we are, while the more we love God and others, the more we may achieve good.
 As I pull back onto Highway 101, I concluded the greatest evil must be done by those totally in the grip of self-love, and the greatest good by those closest to the annihilation of self.
 I can't find any flaws in that equation, except as regards finding the way along the path away from self-love.

92m that0m there is a simple formula for this: the one way away from the path to self-love is the only way away92m from0m the path, the92m path0m to love. If the way away is from love, that way away from the path, and the way away from love is the greatest happiness.

Rodregas was surprised to find a pile of equipment outside his door the next morning, and Imeralda sorting through the pile.
 It appeared to be mostly their equipment plus miscellaneous pieces of slaver gear.
 Doi‚Äôvan stood watching, clearly not sure what to make of it.
 When Rodregas tried to apologize Imeralda ignored him and instead said, ‚ÄúWe traded the Immortal Guard equipment for safe harbor here at the village for healing.
 But, of course, there were also regular slaver guards and I claimed their equipment and any money that was in their personal money pouches.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour armor got pretty chopped up,‚Äù she continued, ‚Äúand Doi‚Äôvan did not have any armor to start with.

 We still had our three horses, but none of them were too great to begin with; the two were good for pulling carriages, the other was too old.‚Äù ‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù Rodregas said nodding his agreement.
 ‚ÄúJordaan knows horse flesh,‚Äù she went on, ‚Äúand we were able to trade the three old horses for one of the Immortal Guards‚Äô horses.

‚ÄúIt will help with the healing.‚Äù Why bother?
 I wondered.
 It would be another day of bombardment with mountain fixtures‚Ä¶ maybe whole trees this time.
 My face pinched with annoyance and Chevelle threw me a piece of dried meat, barely holding back a smile as he jumped on his horse.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better get started,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to be a long walk.‚Äù As he kicked his heels, I spun toward the corner where my horse had been.
 He was galloping up the mountain now, just over a hundred yards away.
 I tried to think quickly, to keep the anger from slowing my response.
 Using magic to pull Chevelle‚Äôs horse by the tail, I ran after him, hoping to leap on.
 A tree branch came from nowhere and smacked me flat across the face.

‚ÄúOnto my shoulders,‚Äù Harruq suggested, grabbing Qurrah‚Äôs knees and hoisting him high.
 Qurrah latched onto the roof, paused, and then stepped onto Harruq‚Äôs shoulders.
 The extra height boosted his head and chest above the roof, allowing him to climb to the top despite a moment of flailing.
 Harruq clapped for him, and he smiled at the next roar from the orcs.
 It was a goofy smile, and Qurrah recognized the fear hiding behind it.
 ‚ÄúHurry,‚Äù Qurrah said as Harruq climbed, using a windowsill as a foothold.
 Together, they stood upon the roof and gazed over the wall, mesmerized by the sight before them.
 Mere seconds away, hundreds and hundreds of orcs charged.
 Their race could see as well in night as in day.
 That same racial ability allowed the two brothers to watch the approaching orcs, lean muscle bulging underneath their sweat-glistened pale gray skin.

The call echoed throughout the night, sending wolves yipping away and night owls crashing in a squawking frenzy.
 The symbols on the body flared to a brilliant crimson.
 A sense of exaltation soared through both necromancers as Ahrqur opened his eyes and snarled.
 ‚ÄúRise, slave,‚Äù Velixar commanded.
 ‚ÄúYour soul is trapped in your body and answers only to my command.‚Äù
 The naked elf rose, his eyes burning with red rage.
 The symbols on his body faded until they were but faint scars.
 ‚ÄúGive him his clothes,‚Äù Velixar ordered his student.
 Qurrah fetched a pair of black pants, a red shirt, and a black cloak, all of which Velixar had prepared before the brothers had brought the bloodless body to him.

The sight gave me strength, or courage, or blinding stupidity.
 I didn‚Äôt know, but I went with it with everything I had.
 I was trapped against the wall, unable to move, but there was one thing I could do.
 The sun broke through the clouds and I saw precisely what I needed.
 A shadow crossed the ground in front of us, a hawk flying overhead.
 The corner of my mouth pulled up in a smile as I closed my eyes to join him.
 The scene from above was just as incomprehensible.
 I focused on one thing at a time.
 Directly below me, I saw Grey.
 He was caught, wrapped in vines as my own body was.

You really need your sleep.
 The whole purpose of this little exercise is to convince your mom you've been safely home this entire time.
 If you crash later in the day, she's going to know you didn't sleep tonight."
 "Maybe if you stayed with me it would help me sleep."
 I almost couldn't believe those words were really coming out of my mouth.
 I wanted to blame it on how close he was standing, or how tired I was, or anything else that might be remotely believable, but based on how serious his face had just become, it was too late to take it all back.
 "That doesn't strike me as being a much better solution."
 I felt my neck and face begin to burn from embarrassment.
 I took a step back, and reached for the door, hoping to beat a quick retreat before I could humiliate myself further, but he stopped me with a surprisingly gentle hand.

"I know your card wasn't on the red side, but Mrs. Campbell asked me to stop by and go over a couple of steps you left out on your homework assignment from today.
 Since I just finished with Rachel and was over here already, I thought I'd show you the steps you're missing."
 I nodded my assent as I mentally filed away both his name and the girl's.
 Surprisingly enough, Albert was a good teacher, pointing out the steps I'd been skipping over, and even explaining why they were important.
 It was rare enough to find a school teacher who could really teach math these days, finding a student who could teach was nearly a miracle.
 Rachel packed up her things while I was being instructed in the finer points of inequalities.
 As she slid the last book into her backpack, Albert stepped away from my desk with another smile.
 I flipped over to the next chapter and started in on functions as Rachel exited out a corner door I hadn't noticed before.
 I saw a flash of the stunted, brown vegetation that the locals called grass before the door swung back closed.

 She tried to prepare herself, but she was shocked by the outfits she was shown.
 The material was thin, and they all had plunging necklines, and some were cut so that the edge of the leg hole was almost as high as the arm hole.
 But she managed to find two, one red and one black with pink flowers, that were less shocking than the others and took them to the dressing room.
 These weren't going to work.
 She'd chosen the two with the least amount of d√©colletage, and they still wouldn't work.

Ignorance and scepticism about new opportunities are characteristic of development at each stage and in every field of activity.
 Information about success stories helps overcome this resistance and spurs people to action.
 Enormous potentials are waiting to catch the attention of the society and take off at this moment.
 Proven technology exists in many fields that await application because people do not know or do not believe that it can be employed successfully.
 Imitation of intensive aquaculture methods commonly employed by farmers in Taiwan and Singapore can raise average fish yields in South Asian, African and Latin American countries 25-fold.
 Advanced methods for micro-nutrient management can double or quadruple fruit and vegetable yields in most developing countries.
 A complete list of proven but untapped technologies and commercial opportunities should be compiled for each country, each region and local area.
 Programmes should be initiated to publicize information about commercialization of agriculture, stimulating industrialization, encouraging self-employment and new business start-ups, improving management practices, etc.

 It shredded the comforter and mattress just a few inches from my head.
 I gave him my best lop-sided smile and kissed his arm.

"You're the most beautiful woman in the world, Marie."
 This evening was a wonderful end to a wonderful day.
 Like the day before, what Rick had enjoyed most was seeing Marie's pleasure.
 She'd wanted to see everything, experience everything they'd let her try.
 Everyone had treated her like an eager tourist, little realizing that she was seeing it all from the perspective of someone who'd seen debuts of Hollywood's earliest offerings.
 "Would you like to go dancing?"
 Rick asked as he paid the bill.
 "I don't think so.

She shot me an apologetic look as she answered it, but I already knew Mr. Peters had taken to calling her at unusual times to get updates on where she was at with her shots for the tourism brochure.

 I could barely look him in the eyes.
 I attempted every type of magic he could come up with, to no avail.
 I was beyond frustrated.
 Worse, I could tell he was being gentle on purpose, afraid I would break.

At some point, at some fulcrum point, I understood.
 Today, Bob Dylan remains a force in my life, though now, he‚Äôs also a pal.
 And I can go to him‚Äîto his songs--when I am blue, when I am feeling that the world is a place of malefaction and discommoded energy, when I am feeling that there is nothing to be said for the human race, and I can be readjusted.
 How this happens, why this happens, is secondary to the fact that it does.
 I can listen to ‚ÄúFrankie Lee and Judas Priest‚Äù or ‚ÄúVisions of Johanna‚Äù or ‚ÄúOn the Road Again‚Äù or ‚ÄúClothesline Saga‚Äù or ‚ÄúWatching the River Flow‚Äù and feel that there are angels within humankind.
 I can feel that we are not all lost in the caliginous wastes of our hopelessly chaotic lives.
 Art redeems us.
 This is the seed I‚Äôm seeking, the truth I‚Äôm trying in my clumsy way to impart.
 Dylan is art, for us anyway, for what we‚Äôre talking about.
 Now, knowing Bob, I have to say, he‚Äôs a humble prophet, you know?

From behind her back, Aurelia pulled out a small blue object.

 The half-orc stared at it, thinking.
 Suddenly he knew, and he looked at Aurelia in total disbelief.
 ‚ÄúIs that a book?‚Äù

 ‚ÄúIt seems our friend has some prominence,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 Harruq nodded in agreement.
 The two-story mansion was beautifully painted and decorated.

The thought was much too dangerous to complete.
 My breathing had already sped up, and my balance degenerated so quickly it was a small miracle I made it over to the U-Haul before I keeled over.
 I'd hated the battered vehicle that had spent the last two days carrying us west across I-80.
 It was hard to keep up the feeling though when it was the only thing protecting me from a concussion.
 Half of the horizon was green and beautiful, not land-of-ten-thousand-lakes beautiful, but still not bad.
 I, of course, ended up on the wrong side of the truck; barren dirt and rocks, only occasionally relieved by scrubby plant life, as far as the eye could see.
 I still didn't buy into my mom's oft-repeated claim.
 I'd told her before that Utah would be a lousy place to try and make her way as a photographer.

Velixar should have told him it was like becoming a spider.
 A mere thought of moving sent him spiraling, reappearing place to place.
 Ending the spell left him totally disoriented.
 His sight returned to normal, and it felt a little like falling from a very tall tree.
 As he retched on his knees, he looked about, discerning his location.
 He was beside the building the two elves were in, directly underneath their windows.
 He could see the tips of their arrows sticking out, glinting in torchlight.
 Two adjacent homes were already ablaze, their occupants still inside.
 Qurrah turned and grabbed the frame of the door.

 He hid his pain well.
 The alley opened up to the main street, running south from the center of town into the forest beyond.
 It was there that the bulk of combat had spread.
 Elves battled in the street, horribly outnumbered.
 They were skilled, though, and a steady stream of arrows from homes continued to weaken the human forces.

 The week had flown by much faster than expected.
 Especially considering how slowly each individual day had dragged along.
 Most of my waking hours had been spent wondering if Saturday night was ever going to arrive.
 My train of thought shattered as I got my first glimpse of the interior of what'd become my own personal Mecca.
 The exterior of the building had been impressive, complete with statues and sculptures reminiscent of an eighteenth-century opera house, but I hadn't expected the illusion to hold once I passed through the enormous, gilded doors.
 I'd been wrong.
 The floors were a gorgeous marble which drew the eyes to the nearest golden-white wall, and up the elaborate gilded trim towards vaulted ceilings.
 It was like walking into a palace, complete with painted, spun-sugar clouds, and burgundy drapes made out of rich velvet.

 "Whatever.

 I turned and went out through the exterior door.
 I was all the way out to the parking lot before I realized that I didn't have a way home.
 I was still trying to figure out what to do, when I heard the deep roar of a high-performance engine.

As a soldier‚Äôs body collapsed at the end, the two stopped, and Harruq swore.
 ‚ÄúThe orcs made it through,‚Äù he said, to which Qurrah nodded.
 ‚ÄúThis could be bad.‚Äù
 An orc stepped into the alley, blood splashed across his gray skin.
 He held a sword in each hand, dripping gore coating both.
 Shouting something in a guttural language neither understood, the orc charged.
 ‚ÄúGet back,‚Äù Harruq ordered as he shoved Qurrah to one side.
 He slammed himself against a house, barely dodging a downward chop of the blades.

If God asked me to surrender Zo√´, not just deliver her into his care in some spiritual sense, but say to give her up, send her to live with her mother or grandma, I believe I would rescind any surrender pledge I had made.
 Meaning I‚Äôm probably light years from honest to God surrender.
 And perhaps I‚Äôm light years from devoting myself to communion with God.
 Even on lesser matters than Zo√´, such as writing books and building the Perelandra College writing programs (another of my obsessions), I hesitate to cut back in order to devote more time to communing with God.
 Even during these meditative times on the road, since Pismo Beach I have devoted as much to thoughts of the book that will come of the journey as to whether it all will help me live more like Brother Lawrence.
 I wonder, if I were given the choice between writing a wonderful book or achieving deeper communion, which would I choose?
 The woman I call Sweet still haunts me.
 I imagine if some good Christian folks would suggest that God might have sent her to me, others would assure me she was in the devil‚Äôs employ.
 Whether she came from God, the devil, or by pure coincidence is academic to me.
 If instead of her, Father Abraham would‚Äôve appeared and reminded me that he was willing to not only surrender his son but to impale and burn his own child, I wouldn‚Äôt for a moment consider following his lead, even as far as the give her up part.

We were what they call an underground success, what Memphis specializes in.
 We were talked about but you had to be part of the cognoscenti, the insiders.
 I hated this, if I was aware of it‚ÄîI really don‚Äôt remember.
 Keep in mind, all I wanted to do was play my guitar and write songs.
 And I was writing at an astonishing clip and artists were picking up on it, and, well, the money started coming in.
 See, in a way, I was fortunate.
 I never had to sack groceries at Piggly Wiggly or teach school, or cut lawns.
 Writing songs, I learned early, brought in the bucks.
 And a lot of the talent coming out of Nashville, well, a lot of those guys were singing my stuff.
 See, at that time, everyone wanted to play and sing, but not everyone could write.

Reba, a truck stop veteran, had eyes for Cliff, though she was twice his age.

These wormholes Marie had mentioned were passages formed around black holes, which were collapsed stars.
 And it was all based on the assumption that something besides light could travel at the speed of light.
 In one small paragraph he found that the entire article was theory upon theory: no one had ever found a black hole or a wormhole or anything that could travel faster than the speed of light.
 "You didn't miss anything," Rick told Marie, setting the article aside.
 "Scientists think that it would be possible to travel through time by going through these wormholes the author mentions, but it's all theory.
 Nobody has ever discovered a wormhole, and none of this stuff has ever been proven."
 Marie sighed.
 "This book isn't hard to follow, but I'm rather skeptical.

 He says that if you concentrate hard enough on getting to the time you want to visit, you can do it."

 They encountered a few soldiers as they hurried there.
 All died before they had the chance to swing their blades.

From Morro Bay to Santa Cruz, we followed the coast and made camp for the night on a cliff between Hearst Castle and Big Sur.
 Saturday, midmorning, we landed in North Beach, San Francisco.
 As we passed strip joints whose signage featured females twice as buxom as Lil' Abner's Daisy Mae, doormen beckoned and dared us to enter, though we were four years underage.
 We stood gawking at the posters on jazz clubs.
 Miles Davis, Gerry Mulligan, Stan Getz, Horace Silver, Coltrane, George Shearing.
 Sylvia had taught Eric to revere and me to appreciate those fellows.
 We shot pool at Mike‚Äôs, where Kerouac had drunk plenty, according to Big Sur.
 We slouched in the catacombs of City Lights bookstore reading apocalyptic poems and hoping for a glimpse of the owner, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the poet who loaned Kerouac his Big Sur cabin.
 We roamed alleys and climbed hills no doubt mistaking mathematicians, who commuted daily to San Jose, for poets or novelists.
 Everybody who looked at home, we imagined had flopped in the Beat boarding houses Kerouac immortalized, or at least listened to the man speak his words in the Cellar, accompanied by a jazz riffing tenor sax.

Like maybe they'd had something caustic poured on them.
 I woodenly went through the motions of studying, and then finally pushed all of my books to the side and opened up Les Mis√©rables.
 I tried to lose myself in the book, but the same worries that'd pestered me while I was trying to study continued to grate against the back of my mind.
 I hadn't wanted to come here, but I'd tried to make it work.
 Mom keeping the pendant felt like a complete betrayal.
 She'd known how it would impact me, but hadn't cared.
 I finally gave up on trying to immerse myself in nineteenth-century France, and cried myself to sleep.

 Alec shook his head at my curious stare.
 "Dom and Jasmin both seem to be spending more time in bed than you'd expect based on the wounds they took putting down Cassie and the others.
 Isaac moved like an old man when we spared yesterday and Donovan is looking old lately."
 I thought back and realized he was right, about Donovan at least.
 The old shape shifter always moved gingerly thanks to old injuries that had left his right leg permanently crippled.
 I hadn't thought anything of it at the time but Donovan was looking frailer lately.
 The thought of Donovan getting to the point that his age was starting to show nearly made me choke up.
 I didn't have the extensive history with Donovan that Alec's family had, but he'd been unfailingly kind to me despite the fact that I'd endangered everything he cared about.

‚ÄúShe is not as free with her body as most Nymphs,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúNo, she is not.
 She only lies with men who she truly feels a great respect for,‚Äù Jordaan answered.
 Rodregas had known that fact, but had not really thought about it.
 ‚ÄúSo what you are saying is that Imeralda forms a life bond like a AElf.
 But while a normal AElf has only one she can form multiple bonds, and she has a bond with you and a bond with me?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúYes, I know of few other cases like this.
 She will always know where you are.
 And my guess is if you are open to the bond, you will be able to know where she is.
 But, there are also deeper implications.

e first thing92m that0m Imeraldada is going to feel, Imeralda, is the feel of your love. But, more than that, she is your friend.

He had suffered for years with a subtle kind of inner rot at letting the evil continue.
 In all the ways that mattered Rodregas knew he was no better than this man, he had spent most of his life as a slaver.
 Rodregas had no moral grounds on which to kill these men, but inside of him there was no mercy.
 He had crossed a line and could no longer live with the evil.
 Rodregas let go of the guard‚Äôs shield.
 He did not have the angle to grab his opponent‚Äôs throat.
 Instead he had to grab the man‚Äôs lower face which was exposed by the half helm, and then he squeezed.
 Rodregas felt the guard‚Äôs face give way to his rage and unnatural strength.
 For a moment the guard struggled to escape his hold, but Rodregas pulled him closer with one hand and with the other ripped his opponent‚Äôs face away.
 Rodregas felt a stab in his back as he took either an arrow or a sword.

one of these hands, and the other went to Rodregas‚Äôs throat. Gas gripped the back of the92m guard0m‚Äôs head.<eop> Rodregas reached out with one hand, and pulled on the guard again, until he grasped one side of the man‚Äô92ms0m head, and the other grasped on the other side of his mouth.

The human men would be of least interest to the Guild and the easiest to blend in.
 On the other hand, while the Hellborn were feared and disliked, the Immortalists should not be interested in Doi‚Äôvan.
 He was also clearly a gifted warrior and between the two of them they would make a dangerous duo.
 However, the Hellborn were feared because of their daemonic natures; they had hungers and urges and famously bad tempers.
 Doi‚Äôvan could be just as much of a danger as help.
 Rodregas had to admit though, that in the little time he had dealt with him, he kind of liked the big guy.
 It looked like Audrian was going to argue, but Rodregas just cut him off and stated, ‚ÄúVery well, you two may travel with me, but let‚Äôs get on the road.
 Audrian, make sure you and the other two do not forget your oaths.
 I will expect no one to know that we head for the Northern Coast.‚Äù Audrian looked like he was going to say something.
 Rodregas thought the loss of the Hellborn did not bother him, but the beautiful half AElfin maiden was another matter.

 It was tight but not uncomfortably so, and it was pretty.
 But she blushed at her profile.
 She filled the front of the bathing suit, and the curve of her hips was all too apparent.
 To her eyes, she looked bulky.
 She didn't want to go out there and ask Rick's opinion.
 She blushed again at the thought of people seeing her like this.
 But people would see her at the shore tomorrow, so she pushed the curtain aside and stepped out.

Over the past few years, before losing my dad, she had helped bury her father, a sister, and two brothers.
 She was the one who always fed me, nursed me, brought home a monthly check, and covered the debts my dad‚Äôs failed business ventures had accumulated.
 But soon after that dreadful Christmas, she got stricken by headaches and became a hermit.
 Evenings she would withdraw to her room and lie with a cool cloth on her forehead, listening to the Lakers, the Padres, or Dodgers, or to whomever the playoffs featured.
 Even through the World Series, she hardly watched an inning on television.
 She preferred the dark and her radio.
 That year, the Yankees won in five games.
 The following week my mom stayed home from her job, teaching eighth-grade English.
 Her headache was so wicked, she grimaced and groaned.
 I tried to coax her to the doctor.

fine, but she was still in92m pain0m. So I went to the doctor. The next day she was taken to the hospital.

I just pulled a cloak from the pile on her bed and was out the hidden door behind the wardrobe.
 I ran in a crouch, praying no one spotted me as I gained on her.
 I only once glanced at the house in the fear I wouldn‚Äôt be able to find my way back.
 If I wanted to catch Ruby, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to mark my path.
 Her cloaked form leapt over a tall rock and disappeared.
 I hurried forward, sure I was about to lose both her and the route.
 When I topped the rock, I froze, taking a heartbeat too long to drop to my stomach.
 Just over that ridge stood a group of elves, though after my pulse settled, I didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd seen me before I‚Äôd fallen back.
 I wasn‚Äôt quite close enough to hear, but didn‚Äôt see a better vantage point.
 I squinted, examining the figures.

I felt tears collecting in the corners of my eyes as I reached out and touched the nearest tree.
 It was as if the world I'd known my entire life had been simply a moldy cover designed to hide the true nature of my surroundings.
 Now the mask was gone and I was immersed in vivid colors, living lights, and a sense of harmony so strong it nearly overwhelmed me.
 It was impossible to say for certain how long I sat looking at the gentle motion of the tree branches, marveling at the way things made up of light could still cast shadows when silhouetted by the harsher light of the sun.
 Only somehow the sun had disappeared, replaced by the paler, colder light of the moon.
 The trees were still graceful strands of light, but the breeze had changed to a harsh thing, one carrying new scents that somehow represented danger.
 Something inside me forced my limbs into motion.
 I was running before the first howl tore through the night.
 I was moving unimaginably fast, jumping fallen trees and bounding over other obstacles which even my improved vision struggled to make out in time for me to avoid them.
 The speed of my passage wrung tears from my eyes, but I didn't dare slow.

"I promise that every word I just told you is true.
 More importantly, I promise I'll make sure nothing terrible happens to you."
 Looking into Brandon's caring eyes, I almost couldn't believe any of it.
 Being threatened and then having the perfect man come to your rescue didn't happen in real life.
 Then again, maybe I was due for some happy endings.
 With a sigh, I thanked him for the ride, and we parted ways.
 The only thing of note that happened in Biology was that for a few moments at the beginning of the hour it almost seemed that the near-constant stares had somehow changed and taken on a more sympathetic tone than they'd had previously.
 It seemed silly to even entertain the idea.
 People my age don't really do sympathy very well.
 We're much more inclined towards ridicule and hasty, usually unfair, judgments.

And, of course, only homes made by nymphs could make living on a ley line comfortable.
 ‚ÄúThis home truly is a find,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan, ‚Äúand now I see why the Dire Cats showed themselves to us.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúDire Beasts seek such places to lair,‚Äù answered Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúWhether their ancestry is Celestial or Infernal, they instinctively seek a place that has a higher level of magic energy.
 But they find ley lines like this irritating as much as we do, unless there is some way to smooth out its turbulence.
 This is especially true of pregnant females.
 The strongest dire animals are not just those of nearest descent, but also those who come to term in high magical environments.‚Äù Rodregas nodded, he had heard bits of this but he had not really thought about it.
 Doi‚Äôvan stretched his hands up and up to an impressive height, and a smile spread across his face, the first one Rodregas had seen on the Hellborn face.
 It was good to see, though it was also a little scary as his teeth were more pointed than Rodregas was used to seeing.
 His teeth had more in common with the Dire Cats than himself or Imeralda.

 How could it be that a man she‚Äôd known only a week wanted to be with her all the time when she‚Äôd gone four or five days at a time without seeing the man to whom she was betrothed?

At first I thought it was a sound on the car radio but quickly realized it must be Ashley.
 She was obviously the only person who had this number and she was very apologetic for the failure to show.
 Ashley said she wanted to get the Oxys as soon as possible and that there would be no problems this time, as she knew Steve was completely out of product and would meet me on my terms.
 In a judgment call that I had not previously planned, I flatly told her that I already sold the Oxys through the other buyer that I had told her about.
 She was notably upset and actually confronted me on my ‚Äúpromise‚Äù to sell them to her.
 I pointed out that I waited in a parking lot for her for over an hour and she was the one who flaked.
 I described how easy it was to sell the one hundred Oxys to the other guy and that he met me exactly where I wanted and when I wanted, gave me the cash and it was a breeze!
 She asked me if I had any more and I told her I had a few but not enough to trouble with.
 I then told her that I had a refill available for ninety Oxys that was good to fill next Tuesday.
 I swear I am making this dialogue up as I go along, just to fit all the necessary criteria and to put her off until next Tuesday.

Would that stop everything from going wrong?
 I mean, then you wouldn't have been poaching his property or whatever you call it."
 It was bad enough that my heart was shattering as I said it, the look in Alec's face made everything a hundred times worse.
 For a second I thought the earth was shaking, but it was Alec, trembling much like he'd done Friday night.
 A loud crack from beside us made me jump.
 Alec looked at the branch, easily as thick as my arm, which he'd just torn from the tree we were leaning against.
 He stopped shaking as he considered what he'd done to the poor tree.
 "You're saying that because you're worried for me?
 Not because you really want to go back to him?"

Britney's eyes grew bright, even after such a short acquaintance, I knew she was about to launch into a blow-by-blow account of the last twelve or so hours.
 "Listen, I don't mean to be rude, but I've got to finish up my physics homework.
 Can we catch up during lunch?"
 Britney looked a little crestfallen, but her eyes quickly lit back up, and before I could get my notebook out and start writing, she'd already switched seats to one closer to a gaggle of cheerleaders.
 It was amazing that I hadn't made the connection between light, the fact that light acted like a wave, and the rainbows on the parking lot puddles, but it was all making sense now.
 By the time the bell finally rang to release the circus back into the halls, I'd finished up a reasonable outline, and was feeling pretty smart.
 Alec probably expected me to have been totally stumped, but I'd figured out the exact answer to the assignment, and I was so going to show him.
 The glow of satisfaction more than made up for the fact that Britney chattered non-stop on our way to Algebra.
 I felt like I should feel guilty for not liking her, but I was starting to notice how much of her conversation revolved around nasty gossip that made everyone else in the school sound like rejects or sluts.
 When we finally made it to Mrs. Campbell's class, I slid into my seat with a sigh of relief.

She then ran her hand from one to the next until she had touched all twelve books.
 Then, she looked up and her expression reminded Rodregas of some girl who had gotten the perfect mid winter gift that she had been dreaming of.
 ‚ÄúThese are not books on magic,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúThese are Grimoires, several of them of great power.‚Äù ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚ÄúI was a squire who learned a little magic, but I really can‚Äôt say that I know the difference between a book of magic and a Grimoire.‚Äù Imeralda looked surprised and said, ‚ÄúOh, you guys must depend on the oral tradition.
 That is a hard way to learn.
 The symbols and geometric figures that form a powerful spell are often too complex to learn from just the spoken word.‚Äù Rodregas cut in and clarified, ‚ÄúI mean, in the order we did read books on magic theory and history, but I never felt energy from them before.‚Äù Imeralda nodded, ‚ÄúLet me explain.
 First, you have a lot more power now, and power calls to power.
 So, you are a lot more sensitive to the power that the books have.
 But what separates Grimoires from other books is that they are made like the stone walls of these buildings, by Nymphs.
 It is thought that the original reason was simply to have books that would not rot over a period of centuries, but the nymph-created paper and leather can hold a faint imprint of magic.

I thought about going back to the Lilac Room, but it would've just been because I was worried about what everyone else was thinking.
 I'd been raised to believe good little girls didn't spend the night with boys.
 Not even boys who were so gentlemanly it was sometimes painful.
 I still believed that, but my desire to be with Alec had devoured the parts of my brain that used logic and reason to decide things.
 I wanted to be with him while he slept, even if it was only for a couple of hours.
 Everyone in the pack already knew I'd spent the night.
 In the end, the reasonable part of me never had a chance.
 Waking up next to Alec fully vindicated my decision.
 He'd greeted me with his typical, heart-stopping smile and I'd leaned in to kiss him before I'd even realized I was in motion.
 He'd pulled back, but his expression at least wasn't reproachful.

h, I'm sorry. I glanced at his face and reassured myself that he'd never look at me that way.<eop> Then again, I wasn't sorry. He was a sweet, sweet92m little0m boy and I didn't need92m him0m to know that.

Glancing at him, she turned and headed downstairs.
 Rick followed her, wondering if she was mad or embarrassed or confused.
 Most women would never again speak to a man who had rejected her touch.
 But most women would have known exactly what they were doing.
 Marie had simply been yielding to the pleasure of his kisses and touches with no intention of giving up her virginity.
 He'd never known a woman so passionate.
 When they walked out into the garden, Marie headed for the fog without a backward glance.

Nothing that mattered yesterday mattered anymore.
 My gut felt as if a big snake were coiled inside it.

 If he couldn‚Äôt become Superman, I estimated my chances equaled about the square root of zero.

I ran from town and pushed through the brush at the edge of the village, taking the shortest direction out of the boundaries.
 I kept running until I became winded and then hastily searched for some kind of shelter.
 Burrowing deep in a briar patch, struggling to catch my breath, I wrenched the wad of papers from under my shirt, buried them in the soil beside me, and then waited for my punishment to come.
 But no one was coming.
 I was na√Øve to think they would chase me like hounds on a fox.
 They had magic‚Äîthey were High Council.
 I stayed in the patch of briars for most of the day, cowering despite myself, but as the sun lowered in the sky, I crawled out on my belly to start the long walk toward home.
 It was late by the time I reached the tree and I was tired enough I didn‚Äôt care as much about being caught.
 I didn‚Äôt even know if they knew who broke the seal, if they knew I was the guilty party.
 But I was still quiet as I entered the house, then my room, and slid into bed.

Things that weren't any of their business, things you weren't ready to discuss.
 Somehow I knew Rachel wouldn't pry.
 It was like keeping so many secrets for her brother had made her especially sensitive to other people's secrets.
 Another few steps brought us to the door, and I held it open for Rachel to follow me outside.
 The intense heat felt like a physical blow.
 I could almost feel my pores open up in an effort to keep me from overheating.
 The sensory overload as my eyes tried to adjust to the unfiltered afternoon sun momentarily distracted me.
 It wasn't until I heard the other door swing shut that I realized James had followed us through, but he'd taken the door on the right instead of the one of the left that I'd been holding open for him.

Both shot to their feet as Velixar‚Äôs bellowing command rolled over the town.
 ‚ÄúWhich way do we go?‚Äù Harruq asked.
 ‚ÄúFollow me,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 The two rushed past the elaborate elven homes toward the sound of combat.
 They kept to the back alleys, and because of this, they met their first target: three elves fleeing toward them, hoping to use the lesser-known pathways to avoid the overwhelming numbers of their opponent.
 ‚ÄúBring them down,‚Äù the necromancer said.
 ‚ÄúWith pleasure,‚Äù Harruq said.
 He raised his blades and charged.

 I imagined I could hear him smile.
 "Thank you.
 I'm afraid mostly all I see is the flaws.
 Even with the most perfect subjects, I still generally fail to capture their true essence."

 "No, not all of them."

And, what for a Memphis musician is worse, so soulless.
 Buddy had gone to hell, many in Memphis thought, though no one said so.
 There was, for a homegrown prodigy, still respect, pride, a sort of sweetly sad valediction.
 When Buddy was buried in L.A. that was the final blow.
 His parents flew out for the interment but no one else from Memphis went.
 It is said there were many celebrities there.
 I hope so.
 I hope he drew a crowd at the end, a healthy gate-count.
 Jack Nicholson was there.
 Debbie Anspach, Donald Sutherland, Larry Hagman, Candice Bergen, Dennis Hopper, Jagger, Ringo.

 Ruby stepped in front of him.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stay with her.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt reply; he merely turned from her to walk into the haze.

But security only exists as a craving.
 Even though the college in Chico gave me tenure, so they couldn‚Äôt have fired me unless I kidnapped the president or his wife or daughter, I had to leave it behind because Laura and I split apart and my kids, whom I loved more than life, health, art or anything, went to live in San Diego.
 I tried commuting (1000 mile weekend trips) for a while but, feeling what I imagine was a similar emptiness to that of Mexicans who labor up here for their families in Mexico, I chucked the best job I‚Äôll probably ever have and returned to San Diego.
 In those first years back, the times I lived for were coaching Cody and the team during practices and ball games at Kuhlken Field, home of La Mesa National Little League.
 Named after my dad since he had been president and organized the renovation of the field.
 During our games, pulling for Cody, I came to understand why a father I knew dropped dead in the stands, when his heart failed while his son was pitching.
 As teenagers, my kids carried on the family tradition of abject rebellion, to the degree that I wrote a Reader story about the Tough Love group I was attending weekly.
 The year my kids began to climb out of the mud, I met Pam.

His face twisted in agony as his right arm was dislocated from its socket, leaving the limb hanging limply at the shoulder.
 I was glad I didn‚Äôt hear that sound.
 He turned back to his questioner, his mouth a grimace as the words came out, unmistakably a curse, and his other arm was wrenched from its place as well.
 He winced, apparently not yet numb from the damages, and then his face went hard, his lips pressed together, jaw clenched tight.
 He wasn‚Äôt going to scream.
 Or talk.
 His back twisted and he fell, a motionless heap on the ground.
 His body was bent out of recognition.

Expecting someone to just stop being addicted is as absurd as asking someone to stop having cancer.
 These addicts need professional help from those who are trained in this field.
 We are ignorant and ill prepared to help and understand an addict and that ignorance could be deadly.
 We can only pray that these addicts can overcome their addiction and start living a clean and sober life one day at a time.

He saw a city burning, people fleeing in the streets, and then he saw himself dressed in black armor that oozed power.
 Salvation and Condemnation waved high above his head, both drenched in blood.
 He looked like a god among men, and the way the soldiers fell at his feet made him think he might have been one.
 This red-dream self looked straight at him and spoke, but Harruq could not understand the words.
 The sound of his own voice chilled him, though, for it was dark, it was dangerous, and it was exactly like Velixar‚Äôs.
 _A god among men,_ said a second voice, one he had never heard before.
 It was darker than any shade that haunted his nightmares.
 There was only one it could be, and it was no mortal.

Everyone would be so busy looking at the other three girls that they wouldn't even notice me.
 It wasn't ideal, but it was better than nothing.
 A quiet knock brought us all around to find Jessica waiting at the door, her makeup and hair partway done, a dress bag slung over her arm.
 "Can I join you guys?"
 Her voice was scratchy, and her eyes were red from crying, but she was putting on a brave face, and Rachel didn't even hesitate.
 "Of course, Jess.
 We figured you wanted some privacy with Isaac, or we would've dragged you over here hours ago."
 The rest of us were quick to pipe in, but at least on my side, the sentiment was a little half-hearted.
 Unlike Jasmin, Jessica never had come around, never made her peace with the fact that because of me things were going to go downhill in a hurry after tonight.
 I'd tried to get both Rachel and Dominic to explain why she hated me so much, but neither would give me a real explanation.

The bigger half-orc was aware of subtle differences, but had little clue to what they were.

 The blue and silver grew thicker and thicker.
 Qurrah‚Äôs words grew louder, more powerful, and then Ahrqur‚Äôs spirit ripped into the air, a glowing blue-silver form of insanity.

 The two took to the air and joined the other survivors.
 They did not try to locate their dead among the hundreds of other rotting bodies.
 Instead, a few elves flew low and scattered firestones, small pebbles that burst into flame upon landing.
 Grass and bodies ignited, and the battlefield rapidly swelled into a giant funeral pyre.
 Qurrah crawled out from underneath the body as flames erupted all around him.
 Everywhere he looked, he saw embers and corpses.
 He spotted the robes of Velixar and ran to them.

He turned the outstretched hand palm up, indicating the stool beside me, as if that had been his intention all along.
 ‚ÄúMay I?‚Äù I nodded once and he slid onto the stool, facing me, not the table spread with documents.
 Have I still not spoken?
 His eyes moved down to the pendant against my chest and then quickly back to my face, as if he had committed an indiscretion.
 We sat there for a few more moments, but my words would not return, not with this imposing stranger inches before me.
 When he finally spoke again, I realized his offer of help wasn‚Äôt a request.
 ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs begin with histories.‚Äù He flicked the middle finger of his left hand and a thick ivory tome flew from a shelf, opened, and steadied between us as if on a table.

When the bell finally released us, I couldn't avoid Britney any longer.
 "Adri...ana, why didn't you tell me?"
 I didn't answer for several seconds, not sure I'd actually heard her right.
 "Tell you what?"
 "Fine, play coy.
 I just think you should know it's pretty lame for me to find all that stuff out second hand.
 We're best friends; you should totally have trusted me enough to tell me."
 Apparently I'd only thought the anger was under control.

All right, so it was just the hawk.

 I quickly passed through their minds, urging them to stampede, and then returned to the sky.
 When I entered the bird again, something was wrong.

 Someone else.
 The shock of it threw me back to my own mind.

‚ÄúOnto my shoulders,‚Äù Harruq suggested, grabbing Qurrah‚Äôs knees and hoisting him high.
 Qurrah latched onto the roof, paused, and then stepped onto Harruq‚Äôs shoulders.
 The extra height boosted his head and chest above the roof, allowing him to climb to the top despite a moment of flailing.
 Harruq clapped for him, and he smiled at the next roar from the orcs.
 It was a goofy smile, and Qurrah recognized the fear hiding behind it.
 ‚ÄúHurry,‚Äù Qurrah said as Harruq climbed, using a windowsill as a foothold.
 Together, they stood upon the roof and gazed over the wall, mesmerized by the sight before them.
 Mere seconds away, hundreds and hundreds of orcs charged.
 Their race could see as well in night as in day.
 That same racial ability allowed the two brothers to watch the approaching orcs, lean muscle bulging underneath their sweat-glistened pale gray skin.

 Fresh tears rolled down her cheeks, and she laid her head on his shoulder.

A part of me knew this was all stupid, but I couldn't shake the depression.
 I was just aware enough to register Brandon's concerned glances as he drove me into school.
 Mrs. Sorenson shot me a nasty look as I stumbled into class.
 "Well isn't it nice of you to come to class today.
 And here we all thought you were doing so well you didn't need to bother with the test."
 I took the proffered test and made my unsteady way back to my desk.
 The class passed in a blur as I made a half-hearted attempt to focus on the questions and remember all kinds of facts about photosynthesis that I'd known just a few days before.
 It was useless.
 The separate pieces of information skittered about on the edge of my memory without ever becoming tangible enough to relate to the answer I needed.
 By the time class ended, I'd almost completely shut down.

As he looked over, Rodregas saw that Junnit and Dale had re-bound the AElf maiden with iron and replaced her gag so that she could not use magic on them.
 While they guarded her they also kept her at a distance as if she was somehow strange now.
 To them she was supposed to have been consumed by the ritual, and they seemed a little put off to have the AElf maiden standing there.
 Both were watching their prisoner but also throwing quick concerned looks over to where Rodregas now crouched on the tower roof.
 Captain Poir looked hesitant but then nodded.
 He walked over to the table and gathered up the robes.
 ‚ÄúDamn, Rodregas thought‚Äù he had said ‚Äúplease.‚Äù Master Ravenhurr ordered something done; he did not say ‚Äúplease‚Äù to his guard captain.
 As Rodregas stood, Captain Poir held the robe open and he clumsily put it on.
 His movements were awkward in this new larger body.

The Order was unique in that it trained not just in the various martial arts but also in the magical, and recruited those who had magical power, but lacked the temperament or intelligence to be a sorcerer.
 Instead of working toward the power of sorcery, they underwent the Sigil ceremony, gaining a magical enhancement but losing the versatility of a true mage.
 Gaining such sigils was outlawed by the guide except for their own warriors, but the Order of the Soaring Heavens was also the traditional sources for the Gods own Paladins, and even the Celestial Guild had never dared to anger the gods by interfering with their use of sigils.
 Rigoria had been one of the greatest of the Order of the Soaring Heavens, but he had grown old and his health had failed him.
 When tempted by the Immortalists with a new body, he had accepted.
 Even though such action was anathema to the very teachings of the Order, he had become an officer of the Immortal Guards, and eventually their leader.
 Several of the most powerful Knights had over the centuries, formed the officer core of The Immortal Guards.
 These Knights traded their honor for near immortality in the Guards.
 The Immortal Guards were all sigil warriors with one or several magical enhancements.

She thought Harruq might stop and claim the cut counted.
 He didn‚Äôt.
 Instead he crosscut, his left arm swiping right while the other swept left.
 She turned to one side, using her staff to press one sword into the dirt and knock the second swipe just above her.
 The staff continued twirling, positioning Harruq‚Äôs hands further out of place.
 She used the awkwardness to gain further separation between them.
 Her hands ached from the force of every block and parry.
 Her breath was fast and shallow.
 Her hair, which she had failed to tie up before the fight, hung in wild strands before her face.
 She was beautiful, but Harruq did not see it.

"OK." "I haven't had a chance to make breakfast.
 Since it's so early, why don't I do that before we go out to the garden?"
 He started to say that he wasn't hungry, but he wanted to put off her walk in the garden as long as possible.
 So he helped her make breakfast and then managed to swallow most of his.
 Out in the garden, he took her hands, gazing down at her.
 "I won't kiss you like I did yesterday.
 But I want you to know how very much I love you."
 She smiled, raising her lips to his for a brief kiss.
 As she wandered off, Rick focused his mind on the TV shows they'd watched last night.

As long as he was willing to talk I was going to fight off sleep.
 "Something happened though to break the bonds between the Sun and the Earth.
 Some say the Earth insulted the Sun, who is incredibly vain.
 Others believe the Sun's children marred the face of the Earth, and that when she refused to discipline her wayward family, the Earth swore in his wrath to destroy them."
 Alec adjusted his pillow and continued.
 "Whatever the cause, it's commonly held that this was the point at which the Earth ceased to be a paradise.
 Bountiful gardens were replaced by weeds and thorns.
 Hurt and betrayed, the Sun distanced herself from the Earth, lessening the number of life-giving rays warming his surface.

Any enjoyment I'd just experienced as a result of seeing one of my least-favorite teachers put in her place quickly soured as she started the class and launched into her usual barrage of questions designed to demonstrate my stupidity.
 Alec had apparently gotten under her skin even more than I'd realized.
 She abandoned her usual practice of stopping once I missed my first question, and instead continued to grill me, her smile growing each time I failed to answer something correctly.
 My earlier commitment to rededicate myself to school notwithstanding, the weekend hadn't exactly been conducive to mastering the intricacies of our latest subject.
 Her smile was wide indeed by the time the bell finally released me to flee in defeat and embarrassment.
 Alec paced me all the way back to my locker.
 "Is that normal for her?"
 I started to laugh, only to cut the motion short as I realized there was a better than even chance I'd end up crying instead.
 I settled for just nodding as I swapped books and slammed my locker shut.
 Alec pursed his lips for a second and then nodded, not at me, but at whatever decision he'd just made.

They ran into some friends of hers, and she introduced him as her betrothed.
 And he kissed her twice more--once as he helped her into his automobile when they left the club and again when he said goodnight to her.
 Now that they were betrothed, maybe he'd kiss her all the time.

Ruby winked at him on her way out and the gesture lit a burn in my chest.
 I turned back to my room and climbed into bed, angry at myself more than anything else, and determined not to let him see.
 I covered my head with a corner of the blanket, suffocating my fractured thoughts with the absence of light.
 I was unsure how long I‚Äôd slept.
 The house was quiet when I slipped from bed, trying not to make a sound.
 I peeked into the main room, finding Chevelle sitting against the front wall, a small window over his head.
 He leaned over, working on something in the palm of his hand, a steady scratching accompanying the movement of his wrist.
 I started forward and my boot scuffed the floor, alerting him to my presence.
 As he glanced up, he slid whatever he‚Äôd been working on into a pocket at his hip.
 It dawned on me then that the main room had only the entrance and two other doors.

It was entirely different when it might cost her the biggest break she'd ever had.
 She nodded jerkily as she stepped out of the room, already dialing.
 I felt my eyelids drooping by the time she came back.
 "They want me to leave right now.
 She said she's already arranged for a charter plane out of St. George.
 If I leave in the next ten minutes, we can make the flight out of Salt Lake International with something like half an hour to spare."
 We both sat there in silence for a few seconds as everything sank in, and then Mom exploded into motion.
 She ran downstairs to repack her photography equipment, all the while yelling upstairs to verify that I'd packed all of the other essentials she was going to need.
 Almost before I'd even finished assimilating how quickly Alec had pulled everything together, Mom was backing down the lane as I waved goodbye.
 Alec appeared within thirty seconds of Mom's departure, Isaac close behind him.

The girl was leading.
 Her dark, wavy hair and flawless skin would've made her pretty in any crowd, but she also had perfectly symmetrical features and one of those bodies that required hours each day in the gym to maintain.
 I wanted to hate her.
 It didn't make any sense, she could hardly be blamed for taking care of herself, but it just didn't seem fair.
 Simply by being in the same town as us, she automatically made every other girl in school feel like bloated, heifers.
 Surely she was somehow cheating to be doing so well in the subtle, nasty game in which every high-school girl ranked herself against every other female.
 I probably would've spent the rest of the day depressed, but once she was out of my line of sight I was able to see the boy following her.
 He was incredible.
 Just looking at him drove every other thought out of my mind.
 If the girl who'd just walked by me without acknowledging the existence of any of us lesser beings was every boy's ideal physical specimen, the boy was every girl's dream.

As impressive as the stereo no doubt was, it was all of those shelves filled with books that finally pulled me off of the bed and onto the incredibly lush, maroon carpet.
 Emerson, Ayn Rand, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy were all present.
 Whoever lived here was either incredibly well read, or a complete poser who bought books just for show.
 Almost scared to find out which it was, I reached over and pulled out the copy of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and opened it up to find a well-cared-for book that'd still obviously been read several times.
 I carefully slid the book back into its spot and then noticed the faintest glimmer of light coming from an open doorway off to my right.
 It was an art gallery.
 One covered in pictures that were eerily familiar, all with a circular signature at the bottom right hand corner.
 They were mostly of mundane kinds of things, landscapes, or people, but there were overtones that caressed a hidden chord inside my soul.
 Everything was done in drab, painfully boring colors, overlaid with incredibly vibrant, hues that were almost unreal in their perfection.
 It wasn't until I'd moved around a corner and entered what looked like a new phase for the painter that I figured out why the paintings looked so familiar despite the fact that I'd never seen any of the places or people depicted.

It was all so crazy.
 Two weeks ago my life had revolved around my inability to think of certain things without collapsing.
 That hadn't changed, but now there was a distinct possibility Jasmin was going to hurt me just to ensure I stayed silent.
 Oh, and I was actually considering opening myself up for some very nasty ridicule, just on the infinitesimally slim chance a boy who was so popular, rich, and gorgeous that he shouldn't even know my name might be interested in me.
 Life was supposed to get better as you got older, but it was starting to look like it just got more complicated.
 Just before I looked back down at the shiny aluminum of my now-naked can, Brandon looked up and caught my eye.
 The smile on his face seemed to say all kinds of things.
 I'm sorry I can't come over and talk.
 They all really depend on me.
 This whole thing with Jasmin is really crazy; we've got to figure out how best to handle it.

 I wish you'd stop asking me to."
 His gaze was long and steady, but finally he nodded.
 "You have as much right to see this through as anyone else does, but it's almost certainly going to get a lot uglier before it's over.
 Your freedom is going to be incredibly restricted, at least as bad as it was today.

It gave a screech and fell to the floor, dead.
 Emily raised her hands and vines shot from the ground and wrapped around a troll that had tried to crush Seth.
 I aimed an arrow at its chest and the troll fell to the ground next to the others.
 The last beast fell, dead from Jason's knife, and we all took in a deep breath.
 Seth sheathed his sword and I slung my bow back on my back.

New varieties of maize are under development that yield 30 per cent more grain in a drought season than conventional varieties.
 They could be especially effective in lowland tropics, including much of Africa.
 Potato yields in Belgium and the Netherlands are roughly three times the world average.
 This productivity gap between what is routinely achieved by different countries represents a vast immediate potential for improving yields that does not require significant additional investment of time or money in R & D. The world already possesses the knowledge, technology and organizational capacities to raise considerably average world yields in major crops.
 Emphasizing cultivation practices
 The phenomenal increases in productivity achieved over the past three decades through the development of improved and hybrid varieties of seeds have over shadowed and distracted attention from the equally great potential of raising yields through improvements in methods of cultivation.
 This is especially true since much of the slowdown in productivity growth is attributable to depletion of soil and water resources, which can be partially rectified or offset by improved practices.
 Growing environmental concerns in the West have generated pressure for reducing fertilizer consumption in developing countries, when in most instances fertilizer application levels are lower than those in Western Europe by a factor of five or ten times.
 Increased, rather than reduced, use of chemical fertilizers will be essential to the expansion of agriculture in these countries and can considerably increase crop yields.
 Total fertilizer consumption by developing countries is expected to double by 2010.

Vincent overreached in his effort to claim the kill, and I sunk my teeth into the muscled flesh of his shoulder as I finally made it around behind him.
 My claws sank into his arms and legs as I repositioned to snap his neck, and then a hammer blow of weight struck me across the shoulders.
 Knocked loose from Vincent, I spun around in time to tear Simon from the air as he leaped at me again.
 It was the perfect opportunity to end a life nearly as evil as Vincent's, but one of the recent arrivals had bowled Jasmin over.
 Leveraging a frame that was more than capable of picking up a small car, I threw Simon into the whirling ball of flesh and fangs.
 He didn't hit hard enough to snap his neck, but he knocked the other wolf off of Jasmin, and then Vincent was back on his feet.
 The rest of the rival pack, save for Brandon their leader, came streaming past, but they didn't help their fellows swarm Jasmin and me over.

Others have come to take these achievements for granted.
 Still others have simply forgotten how much things have really changed.
 But the most important realization to be derived from these events is of the inherent defect in attempts to address the factors underlying international security in a piece meal manner.
 Over the past five years the Commission encountered reminders of this truth in virtually every field that it took up for examination.
 It is this experience that has convinced us of the need for wider perspectives and total solutions.
 The marvellous achievements of the past few years are neither fortuitous nor illusory.
 The Berlin Wall has been brought down and demolished.
 The Iron Curtain has been lifted and obliterated.
 But we still proceed with our heads turned back, looking for shadows behind us at a time when the future demands our full attention in order to capitalize fully on what these events have prepared and made possible.
 In this report, the Commission is calling for a comprehensive, multi-pronged approach to the problem of international security that defies and will continue to defy partial solutions.

Rodregas almost ran face into the squire‚Äôs mace, only throwing himself down barely in time to miss the blow.

 Geriodon responded perfectly.
 He kept one foot planted and spun tight to help counter Rodregas‚Äô speed.
 It should have worked.
 And it did work for several minutes.
 Rodregas simply kept running in a circle around Geriodon just outside the range of his mace.
 He dug into the sand with his feet and he ran, and kept running.

No mess, no pain, and no hurt feelings.
 Jim ‚Äì I‚Äôve tried that, didn‚Äôt work.
 Liz ‚Äì You could just pretend to be stomach-ache then.
 Jim ‚Äì Tried that too, did you know that your mother carries around a bottle of stomach tonic with he in her purse?
 Liz ‚Äì Well there has to be a better answer than stabbing yourself.
 Jim ‚Äì Maybe, but having someone call in a bomb-threat won‚Äôt work every time.
 Liz ‚Äì Very funny Jim.
 Jim ‚Äì I‚Äôm serious, Gene and I talked the whole scenario over for days, stabbing myself is the best way to get away from your mom, and by best I mean the way I spend the least time in jail.

Pain was evident in his eyes.
 ‚ÄúThat man has an army of undead.
 I barely managed to hide until daylight.
 Woodhaven is in danger, and so are you.‚Äù
 Aurelia stepped back, frowning.
 ‚ÄúAre you sure it was Harruq?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI saw the warrior with my own eyes.

He reached up and petted the powerful black head of the creature.
 Its ears had the only hint of non-black on the beast, a slight touch of silver.
 The fur was not as soft as it looked and was actually rough to the touch.
 Rodregas realized his hand was sinking into the skin.
 He tried to pull back but felt himself being drawn into it.
 He was being pulled physically into the panther.
 He started to pull away, but then he stopped and let himself sink into the shape of the great beast.
 Panic set in as his mouth started to sink into the creature‚Äôs head.
 He tried to hold his breath, but he was too late for such an action.
 Rodregas tried to move but his arms refused to reach out and push the Daemon away.

‚ÄúSome night.‚Äù He looked like he was trying to keep a secret.
 Heat crawled up my neck as I remembered climbing into his lap, and then again the second time I‚Äôd gotten out of bed.
 Ruby grinned at him conspiratorially.
 ‚ÄúYes, so educational.‚Äù Had I talked in my sleep?
 Could this get any worse?
 Yes, it could.
 It came back to me then.
 I dropped into a chair, my head falling into my hands to cover my face.
 Ruby started to say something, but Chevelle cut her off.
 ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt you offer your guest breakfast?‚Äù She sniffed.

When he had rammed her, she had tucked the child to guard it from the fall.
 Right before the kill, she had held him, trying to protect him.
 ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù he asked.
 A part of him worried he might wake his brother, but he was too drained to care.
 ‚ÄúWhy did she do that?
 She could have run faster without the child!‚Äù
 No, he knew that answer.
 She would not abandon her child just as he would not abandon Qurrah.
 Then what was bothering him so?
 He fell to his knees and stabbed the old weapons into the dirt.

He turned to see Marie jump to catch a frisbee.
 She threw it to one of three--no, four--guys surrounding her.
 "Marie!"
 She turned to wave to him.
 "Hi, Rick!
 Do you want to play frisbee?"
 "No."
 He watched her play for a couple of minutes and then headed back toward the blanket.
 Marie ran after him.

 she said, almost quivering with excitement as she slid behind the wheel.
 "Yeah, but take a minute to calm down.

 He covered her hand with his, smiling.

 She turned it and let go as soon as she heard a noise.

I guess I should at least be glad you aren't going to lie to me.
 Unless you really didn't ever want to go, and were lying to me all along."
 Rachel shrank in on herself a little.
 It almost looked like she was going to cry, which should have made me feel bad, but I was too mad to care.
 I'd been miserable the whole way there, and especially the whole way back, and then she wanted to just pretend like none of it had happened.
 Rachel's lip trembled slightly as she finally managed to get a response out.
 "This isn't like you.
 Why are you doing this?"
 Cindi used to do the exact same thing.
 Her 'woe is me, I don't understand what is happening act' had usually worked with Dad, and it'd always infuriated me.

Harruq kicked open the barricaded door and then barged up the stairs.
 Qurrah withdrew a few pieces of bone from a pouch.
 He tightened his grip about them, whispering a few words of magic as he did.
 Then he looked to the window.
 He could barely see a bow and part of a hand.
 Qurrah waited.
 The Neldaren warriors charged, hoping to overwhelm their opponents before arrows took them all.
 The elf in the window leaned out to unleash a killing strike, but it was Qurrah who did the killing.
 Four pieces of bone leapt from his hand.
 They hit the elf‚Äôs neck and temple, making a satisfying crack.

Rodregas then dropped his right sword as he kept his left engaged, pushing the blue steel sword away.
 Rodregas moved in and thrust out with his open hand with a speed the guard simply could not match nor have expected.
 Rodregas had the guard‚Äôs throat in his grasp before his opponent knew what was happening.
 The guard was not a big man and with his celestial strength Rodregas simply picked him up and squeezed.
 Rodregas felt the guard‚Äôs neck give under his grip.
 Before the slavers could react, Rodregas went from lifting him up to driving him down into the ground.
 Adrenaline was surging and suddenly Rodregas had a bloody mess in his hand.
 The guard was very dead.
 Rodregas let go of the broken neck and stood quickly, trying to clear himself of the gore.
 Both slavers looked shocked at what had happened and Rodregas moved quickly to take advantage of their surprise.

 ‚ÄúPlease Jazell it‚Äôs nothing you need to worry about, okay?
 Just leave me be, I will deal with it.‚Äù I let my arms fall and Seth lifted his head.
 His eyes were red from crying but something in his eyes showed he was still Seth.
 The same darn stubborn and annoying Seth I was friends with.
 That let me relax a little.
 He faced me, ‚ÄúYou should go back to the others.

Emily held her hand out.
 ‚ÄúHere Jazell, use this to keep your hair out of your face,‚Äù she opened her hand and dropped something in my palm.
 I held it up.
 It was a thin, vine that was about a foot long.
 It felt like a ribbon to me and I shrugged.
 I don't usually wear ribbons and bows; that was Emily's style.
 I pulled my hair back and tied the vine.
 It kept my hair out of my face and acted like a rubber band.
 ‚ÄúThanks Emily,‚Äù I said.
 She finished tying her hair back.

I'm really going to enjoy this."
 Britney had positioned herself so she could see Brandon.
 As a consequence, I could see Alec's entire group, and I was amazed by their reaction to Cassie's belligerence.
 Jasmin's pretty lips drew back in something that looked almost like a snarl, and she'd tensed up so tightly she was almost shaking.
 For a heartbeat I thought Jasmin would launch herself at the other girl, but Alec reached over without looking, and grabbed her arm.
 A stocky, Middle Eastern-looking boy to Alec's right looked like he wanted to act as well, but he was looking at Alec, and an almost imperceptible headshake stopped him.
 I'd been so busy watching the byplay behind Rachel that I'd missed the last two exchanges between her and Cassie.
 Whatever had been said must have been bad though.
 Rachel was shaking, and the blonde looked like someone about to pull the wings off a butterfly.

I‚Äôd known they were dangerous, but did he mean to submit was to accept her fate?
 The image of flames and a circle of cloaks surrounding her was there again and I had to force it away before it turned to an image of me.
 Protection, he‚Äôd kept saying as we worked on magic.
 They‚Äôre going to burn me.
 ‚ÄúThey would kill me because of the pendant, the library?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, Frey.
 You have broken some of your bonds.
 They will not risk trying to bind you again.‚Äù I struggled with an intake of breath.

Seth looked down.
 ‚ÄúYou want them to kill me?
 Maybe I'll tell them in the morning when they aren't so crabby.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou better,‚Äù I snapped and stared at Emily and Jason.
 They were still bickering.
 I felt something on my hand and I looked down.
 Seth had wound his fingers in mine.
 His touch was gentle and cool, kind of reassuring.
 My mind blanked.
 I was holding hands with Seth.
 I never thought that would happen.

Marie closed her eyes, drawing strength from Rick.
 She just hoped he was right.
 And she hoped it would happen soon.
 After Rick had left for work, Marie walked on the treadmill for nearly 45 minutes and then made herself a cup of tea.
 Rested, she opened the box containing the exercise movie Rick had gotten her and with delight put it into the BCR.
 No--VCR, she corrected herself.
 She got so involved in the exercises and then exploring the house that she'd only watched one of the movies--"Gone with the Wind," which made her laugh sometimes and cry sometimes and held her spellbound the entire time--by 5:30, when Rick got home from work.
 ‚ÄúWould you like me to get you some more movies for tomorrow?‚Äù Rick asked Marie as they prepared dinner together.
 ‚ÄúI still have that other one to watch.

‚ÄúShe died of sorrow.‚Äù His brow furrowed.
 We shared the boar and talked further, casually, as if we were old friends.
 He resituated himself on the rock, coming closer to me, and his shirt moved to expose a different color skin where it opened at the chest.
 I reached out to pull it aside and his eyes grew wild at the touch.
 ‚ÄúYour flesh is a different tone here.‚Äù He smiled, as if I were being coy.
 ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù ‚ÄúSometimes I work with my shirt on, to avoid the burn of the sun.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe sun?‚Äù He laughed, but then realized I wasn‚Äôt joking.
 ‚ÄúIt is a tan‚Ä¶ from the sun.‚Äù He pulled the laces and lifted his shirt over his head, throwing it aside to show me his bare chest.
 The bronzed color of his face extended there, but was a lighter shade.
 I examined him closer, taking his hand and turning his arm.
 The inside of his wrist was lighter still, close to the shade of my own skin.

‚ÄúThe Knight Commander might not be willing to stand up to the Immortalists, but he would be more than willing to skip over giving knighthood to someone who was planning to leave anyhow,‚Äù said Rodregas.
 They had made it to the stables and Doi‚Äôvan started to put the saddle and tack onto Doom Hoof, the horse that Doi‚Äôvan had been riding.

For some reason, it infuriated me, and I nearly berated him right there.
 But I remembered I was on the run.
 I remembered this strange elf in front of me.
 I decided to keep my mouth shut before I dug a deeper hole.
 An arm wrapped around my shoulder and drew me forward.
 ‚ÄúIntroduce us, buttercup.‚Äù I grimaced.
 My companion was certainly enjoying himself.
 Chevelle held his hand out in a formal greeting.
 ‚ÄúChevelle Vattier.‚Äù ‚ÄúVattier, eh?‚Äù I thought I heard the stranger mutter under his breath, ‚ÄúWell, you can call me Bonnie Bell.‚Äù Chevelle waited unmoved for his response.
 He finally held his hand out in return.

 I want to share this journey, but I am not a warrior.
 And the two of you were so close to dying on me, and next time I might not be able to save you and you might die‚Ä¶,‚Äù she paused.
 ‚ÄúI could handle dying, but I am not sure I could handle having you die in my arms.‚Äù ‚ÄúImeralda,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan, ‚Äúwe must all walk our own paths.

Greater political and social freedom can only further magnify this tendency.
 This suggests that violence at the international, national and community levels cannot and will not be eradicated before poverty itself has been abolished, and that, if poverty is left unaddressed at its source, further economic progress is likely further to aggravate conflict in society, unless we are able to extend the benefits of progress to everyone.
 This realization would be quite disconcerting were it not for the fact that we are fast approaching the time when both these persistent ills of humankind can be banished forever ‚Äì the way slavery and colonialism were banished in the past.
 The recognition that it is neither desirable nor possible to go backwards adds urgency to our efforts to move forward.
 Revolutions of the past have been partial and localized negative reactions against an existing social order, and benefited only a small part of society that, in turn, blindly resisted change.
 They resulted in war and usually much destruction.
 The revolution of rising expectations is a positive, constructive movement spreading to encompass people at all levels of all societies around the globe, and pressing for the establishment of a higher social organization that can meet the expectations of all humanity.
 But the energies liberated by this revolution have to be properly converted into an evolutionary effort for development, otherwise they will fly off in unwanted directions.
 Society must provide the conditions and opportunities for these energies to express themselves positively and constructively in pursuit of their own fulfilment.
 Education is the most essential ingredient for this transformation.

e mind is a unique collection of ideas. Just as education is a foundation, it92m is0m also the foundation for development of the intellect, for the growth of the arts and humanities, for the development of the knowledge and understanding of philosophy,92m of0m the natural sciences, the92m natural0m and social sciences, and for the opportunity to learn and acquire those necessary skills to advance the enjoyment of all other forms of life.<eop> It92m takes0m a great deal of effort to achieve this, and even a great92m deal0m of courage to

Like the barn, the house was made of perfect cut stone that looked almost new; everything else had gone back to nature.
 Rodregas circled around to the back where the stone steps led to the cellar.
 He was sure that originally that there had had doors covering the entrance, but of course, they were long gone.
 Rodregas smelled what he would find well before he came around the corner.
 Next to the entrance was the corpse of a large bear which had recently been killed and partly eaten.
 It had been a magnificent creature, the largest of the local black bears that he had ever seen.
 Rodregas realized that it had been a Dire beast, drawn here by the safe magical energies.
 Next to the dead bear were the two Dire Cats.

I glanced around, confused about where I was.
 Gray stone walls surrounded us, but I‚Äôd been staring at an open sky, nothing but the cloak between my prone form and the cold earth.
 ‚ÄúWhere are we?‚Äù ‚ÄúFort Stone,‚Äù Steed answered.
 I snickered and Chevelle‚Äôs irritation resurfaced.
 I didn‚Äôt know if it was for me or Steed.
 ‚ÄúFort Stone?‚Äù I asked anyway.
 ‚ÄúNamed for Lord Stone,‚Äù Steed explained.
 Chevelle‚Äôs gaze caught the other man, leaving no question as to the source of his crossness.
 ‚ÄúA lord?‚Äù I tried not to sound too impressed as I took another look around, reassessing the walls.

Water shortages occurring in combination with other sources of tension ‚Äî such as in the Middle East ‚Äî will be particularly worrisome.
 Famine remains a persistent threat precisely because the world no longer feels that threat to be severe.
 India‚Äôs last major famine occurred in Bengal in 1943 during World War II.
 Although the deficit in food production was only marginal that year, three million died for lack of strong administrative intervention to improve distribution.
 A marginal deficit could work havoc in the absence of an efficient and equitable public distribution network.
 While there is no scarcity of food in the world, there is also not a sufficiently organized effort to promote food security, precisely because the sense of urgency is lacking.
 Abundant opportunities exist to eradicate hunger, but in the absence of a catastrophic event, serious effort is lacking.
 Famine attracts media coverage, political and public attention, but chronic hunger does not.
 With global food surpluses accumulating, an organized effort can ensure food security for people everywhere.
 The challenge of achieving food security for all human beings is complex, for it depends on the interaction between multiple factors ‚Äì technological initiatives to produce sufficient food; economic initiatives to stimulate sufficient employment opportunities and increase purchasing power; political initiatives to maintain a peaceful and stable environment, undisturbed by war or social unrest that can interfere with food distribution; and administrative initiatives to provide for those who are unable to provide for themselves due to poverty or during times of emergency.

ecurity will not be a part of the agenda for92m the0m foreseeable future. In most people and other parts of the world during the current92m crisis0m, food security is a priority on the order of priority. In92m many0m countries, food security is threatened by shortages in the sectors of food production that are necessary to produce food for the general population. In the92m near0m future, extensive food blockades may be imposed in the U.S. and Western92m Europe0m. In order to alleviate shortages in food distribution in other areas of

The separate pieces of information skittered about on the edge of my memory without ever becoming tangible enough to relate to the answer I needed.
 By the time class ended, I'd almost completely shut down.
 I registered the whispers as I made my way to English.
 I normally would've been mad, or possibly embarrassed, but it was like my feelings were wrapped in layers of cotton candy.
 If I really pushed, I could faintly feel the hard edges, but there were so many layers shrouding them.
 I just couldn't seem to muster up enough concentration to care.
 I was on autopilot now.
 I answered Britney's whispered questions without ever registering them and never once worried about whether or not I'd made sense.
 I parried Mrs. Campbell's concerned inquiries in much the same manner, probably not convincing her that I was okay, but at least persuading her to leave me alone, and then sleep-walked into the cafeteria.
 I hated the fact that I wanted Brandon to come sit down with me.

Mrs. Campbell wasn't ever really mean, but she gave off an air that made you absolutely sure she wouldn't put up with any crap.
 We were still working on statistics, which was nice in that I could follow what was being said and wasn't falling any further behind, but kind of a bummer because it meant I couldn't do a bunch of makeup work during class.
 It was a relief when Mrs. Campbell finally capped her marker and turned us loose to work on the homework assignment.
 I was midway through the first assignment when one of the aides slipped into the room and whispered into Mrs. Campbell's ear.
 There was a kind of muted, collective gasp that made me look up just in time to see the color drain out of her face.
 Before the aide had even finished whispering, Mrs. Campbell was out of her chair and headed towards the door.
 Thirty seconds later we were all still looking around and wondering what had happened.
 It was a testament to our respect for, or in some cases fear of, Mrs. Campbell that nobody spoke in anything above a whisper for an entire five minutes.
 Every terrible thing that could possibly happen to a person flowed through my mind, and all I could do was hope I was overreacting.
 Mrs. Campbell had scared me a little that first day, but she'd been pretty nice since, and she'd always been fair.

She didn't know how she was going to be able to wait two entire days.
 She was so excited that she felt like she could run all the way to Hollywood.
 After 45 minutes of aerobics, she still wasn't tired!
 She wouldn't be able to sit still and watch TV today.
 She'd do all their laundry and clean the house from top to bottom and have dinner ready when Rick got home.
 She glanced at her watch and decided to get everything ready for breakfast so that it wouldn't take long to cook it for Rick as soon as they got back from her walk.
 She froze in place.
 What if she got back to 1927 today?
 She wouldn't get to go to Hollywood.
 Dropping into a chair, she drew her legs up and wrapped her arms around her knees.

Breathing was agony.

 All his extremities grew cold and his head felt light.
 The pain in his shoulder threatened to send him into shock.

 The forest was too far, and all about was shin-high grass.

He punched his assailant hard in the face.
 The attacker flew back and Rodregas jumped sideways to get more space.
 Rodregas rested his right hand on the knife blade still sticking out of his stomach.
 He was relieved to feel that it was not too deep.
 He had not taken off his armor.
 Although the knife had pierced the leather weave, the tip penetrated less than an inch.
 Rodregas gritted his teeth and pulled the knife free.
 From the feel of its balance, it was not a real fighting weapon, but only a simple utility knife.
 Rather than try to use the unfamiliar weapon that was slick with his blood, he threw it into the dark.
 Quickly Rodregas remembered he was in a fight for his life.

 The map on my palms was gone.
 My skin was unmarked, no indication whatsoever it had even been burned.
 Is this our destination?
 My gaze shot up to find the village, and then I hastily clicked my heels when I realized I was being left behind.
 As we advanced, I could see movement amongst the elves.

The next day Brandon returned to the Narconon facility to start his three months of internship.
 He would learn how to apply the lessons he learned and many more skills he was yet to be taught.
 The months went by slowly for him as he worked for no income as interns do.
 They fed him and they housed him and they educated him.
 He had his ups and downs but he embraced his goal to help others who were afflicted by addiction as he was.
 He started in detox, which was fitting, as it is exactly where he began.
 It was a dirty job that we knew all too well.
 He described how he rubbed the backs of the young men who vomited and comforted them as they reeled in pain from withdrawals.
 He remembered the video of himself and the comparison was obvious.

In my usual humorous deflection of discomfort, I quip that the last time I met Ashley it was a ‚Äúhappy ending‚Äù and I would like the same result this time.
 The officers are un-amused.
 The officers are sent to stake out a nearby drugstore.
 My story to the drug dealers will be that I will fill the prescription there and meet her in that parking lot as it is a stone‚Äôs throw within the county line which they want the bust in.
 One problem I point out is that the drugstore will be closed in a few minutes but they send the crew that direction for feedback on the location.
 The call comes back and the parking lot is virtually empty of cars leaving no cover for the officers to hide.
 I am starting to feel like I know more about this drug busting business than the cops.
 After a change of venue to a nearby grocery store down the street and several miles within the county line, it is nearly 9 pm and I have been unable to call my wife for over three hours.
 The officers move into place for the bust.

 Cloaks flowing in the wind, forming a circle and then massing together, threatening.

Rick had called his sister, and she'd been thrilled Rick had a girl he wanted her to meet and mad that he hadn't invited her sooner.
 If Marie was going to make dinner at his house, they'd obviously been dating long enough to feel pretty comfortable together.
 "I shouldn't have made garlic bread.
 All evening my breath will smell like garlic," Marie told Rick as she finished making dinner the next evening.
 "So will everyone else's."
 "Are you sure Teri likes garlic?"
 "She loves it."
 "What about Jeremy?
 You don't know him that well--maybe he's a vegetarian."

Art ‚Äì Back to women.

 Jim ‚Äì You‚Äôre not going to go on about the birds and the bees are you?

 Jim ‚Äì Good, cause you gave me that speech when I was nine.

 ‚ÄúYou'll lead us into a dragon's cave if you take the lead.‚Äù Seth rolled his eyes again.

His room and the entire house were still searched daily, including the CD cases and every nook and cranny.
 We used the professional drug tests and we tested him randomly.
 Hopefully he hadn‚Äôt found a way to get this drug into our home (again).
 He finished the worst of the drug withdrawals a couple of days after the disastrous intervention.
 When Officer White called, the bust was on.
 I hugged and kissed Brandon and Lisa as if I was about to ship off to a war.
 I felt guilty that I couldn‚Äôt say something to my younger son Bryce but he was now back at college and we hadn‚Äôt told him what I was doing for Brandon.

 I put the last couple of books in my backpack and shrugged.

 I guess she has pretty good reason to be, but she hasn't even given me a chance to apologize."

Rachel opened her mouth, probably to deny it, but the look in her eyes told me it was true.
 She couldn't possibly be that scared about me putting two and two together if he'd been saying nice things about me.
 He hated me, and she was scared of him, scared of what he'd do if he found out she'd let his secret slip.
 "It's not like that, Adri.
 It's..." I didn't even have to cut her off.
 She couldn't finish her own thought, couldn't come up with a lie that was believable.
 I shook my head and went back to my desk before my invulnerability wore off and she brought on another attack.
 I missed them both so badly.

Luke the horse breeder, I can admire, and Eric I can adore, in part because I know their flaws, their humanity.
 Luke's are exposed in "A Father's Story".
 Eric's I can remember, and for reminders, I have his report cards.
 Adoring a human may require us to have developed beyond pure selfishness.
 Yet once that's accomplished, the task seems to come naturally.
 But, at my level, even attempting to adore God is calling for plenty of effort.
 Which I'm beginning to see as the point of this trip I had thought was meant to sell books.
 Still, if God asks me to give up Zo√´, I'll fight him.

Only this time it was different.

 We ran and ducked behind a large boulder, huddling together.
 We all sat down, closed our eyes, and concentrated.
 I felt a shiver run through my body as I left it and entered my hunter form.
 I followed Emily, Jason, and Seth as we crept silently over to the monsters, splitting up to surround them.
 I counted two thrashers, which surprised me.
 I swear we saw more before.
 The thrasher turned before we could execute a surprise attack.

In the commotion, Qurrah vanished, unseen and uncared for.
 He had spent his whole life disappearing in crowds, and in the dark of night, surrounded by fear and worry, he was just a shadow.

 Qurrah was in no hurry as he left the city behind.
 The grass was soft and tall, and it felt good under his feet after so much sprinting down stone roads.
 Stars filled the sky, and he smiled to them often.
 In the distance, he spotted a small fire, and he knew to whom it belonged.

The next floor housed the laboratory.
 The door was locked and he did not want to break it down until he was sure everyone had left.
 The next floor down was the main floor; He stepped out to the main hall and listened.
 He heard nothing but his stomach rumble; he was very hungry and knew that he should eat.
 He was already in the main hall; the room to the right was the kitchen.
 He stepped into the kitchen but then came to a sudden stop.
 Standing next to one of the sinks was a very old, very dirty kitchen drudge slowly peeling a potato.
 She looked up at him in surprise, and with a hint of fear.
 Rodregas raised his hand up in a peaceful motion.

Before long, one of my roommates was busted with an abundance of cocaine and I narrowly missed the arrest.
 I was literally driving away from the house and saw cop cars coming down the street toward it.
 I watched in the rearview mirror as they surrounded the house and I knew he was inside high on free-base and well supplied with cocaine.
 Shortly thereafter I decided to move away and find a new environment.
 Sacramento seemed like it was now completely out of control!
 People were staying up for days on end freebasing, and it was not fun being around someone who is focused on his next fix or dolling out drugs to fellow addicts.
 I moved to Lake Tahoe because they still didn‚Äôt give a shit how anyone dressed and that was fine with me.
 No white polyester pants here!
 My best friend Pete and I opened a waterbed and hot tub store in North Lake Tahoe called Sierra Waterbeds and Hot Tubs‚Äî a venture his father funded.

"I'd rather that you did."
 He returned with a novel that he pretended to read.
 His mind was replaying all the day's events, and he kept peering at Marie over the top of the book.
 She'd washed her makeup off, and she looked like a child, her lashes dark against smooth, rosy skin, one small hand beneath her cheek.
 She was such an innocent young woman and was, as he‚Äôd read, vibrant and fun-loving.
 Even her natural fear of having walked into the future was more often than not suppressed by her sense of adventure.
 He wanted to protect her, now and in the past.

It also looked like he might have a broken nose from the previous day‚Äôs competition.
 The young man did very well, hitting all five targets.
 His shot on the moving target only nicked the edge, still impressive.
 Rodregas stepped forward and picked up the bow.
 It felt light and a little awkward.
 Rodregas focused on his breathing.
 He had five targets and five arrows.
 He shot at the target shaped like a man.
 The arrow sailed over its right shoulder.

 The half-orc bowed and then joined his brother.
 The two journeyed across the hills and then snuck inside Woodhaven.
 When they reached their home, Harruq removed his armor and began wrapping strips of old cloth around his wounds.
 Qurrah watched him for a moment before speaking.
 ‚ÄúYou know what you must do, should it come to it,‚Äù he said.
 Harruq nodded, knowing exactly what he meant.

 Rick had gotten her the Dragonriders of Pern series, since those books were about a world that was new to all readers and had very few offensive elements.
 She'd wanted some romances, but he was afraid that they'd be too explicit for her.

The Order was unique in that it trained not just in the various martial arts but also in the magical, and recruited those who had magical power, but lacked the temperament or intelligence to be a sorcerer.
 Instead of working toward the power of sorcery, they underwent the Sigil ceremony, gaining a magical enhancement but losing the versatility of a true mage.
 Gaining such sigils was outlawed by the guide except for their own warriors, but the Order of the Soaring Heavens was also the traditional sources for the Gods own Paladins, and even the Celestial Guild had never dared to anger the gods by interfering with their use of sigils.
 Rigoria had been one of the greatest of the Order of the Soaring Heavens, but he had grown old and his health had failed him.
 When tempted by the Immortalists with a new body, he had accepted.
 Even though such action was anathema to the very teachings of the Order, he had become an officer of the Immortal Guards, and eventually their leader.
 Several of the most powerful Knights had over the centuries, formed the officer core of The Immortal Guards.
 These Knights traded their honor for near immortality in the Guards.
 The Immortal Guards were all sigil warriors with one or several magical enhancements.
 They also had the best resources of the entire Eastern Realm, the most powerful enchanted armor, the best weapons; their officers rode Dire Beasts for steeds.

 the Dire Beasts92m rode0m Archers for swords and92m spells0m, and the Knights rode steeds for their lances, so they had the strength to be sigil warriors.

She smiled to herself, thinking about how sweet he was to her.
 Already she was feeling better about ending her betrothal to Davis.
 She wanted a man who would spend time with her and hold her and make her feel safe and cherished.
 A man like Rick.
 Tears filled her eyes yet again, and she snatched up a tissue to dab at them to keep from ruining her make-up.
 Rick loved her.

He looked over again at the AElven maiden.
 To an exotic beauty like her a balding overweight man like himself would be invisible under normal circumstances.
 Some of the other guards might be tempted to take what would not be given, but not him.
 Like his mother always told him, a person did not have to own a beautiful sunset to enjoy watching it.
 The door to the top of Raven Tower was large and deeply carved in intricate designs and runes.
 Though as a youth Rodregas had trained in the basics of magic, a secret he was careful not to share, the magical runes were far beyond his understanding.
 He led the prisoners through the door and walked out onto the top of the tower.
 The circular roof was flat and open to the sky.
 The only covering was the landing for the stairs in the East corner.
 The cool night air refreshed his spirits somewhat.

I felt as if she stood there for me to prove l wasn‚Äôt a cop, who likely would leave at least his underwear on.
 She pointed to the bed that was now covered in a bright beach towel.
 I laid face down and she didn‚Äôt offer anything to cover me up as you would in a traditional massage.
 She straddled my buttocks and began to massage my back.
 She told me that she didn‚Äôt have sex as part of her massage.
 I assured her that I just wanted a massage from a pretty young lady and I had no other motive.
 I repeated that I often got massaged from the same older woman and I thought it would be a treat to get a massage from a beautiful young one.
 As I lay there, I could see her in the mirror and we talked from this reflection.
 She pressed the issue of buying the pills.
 She climbed off of me and stood up next to the bed between me and the mirror.

It was still daylight and I tossed and turned, unable to rest.
 I decided to go back to my favorite distraction.
 The time came sooner than any of us expected.
 Looking back, I suppose it was fortunate.
 I can‚Äôt imagine what might have happened if a full birth ceremony had been prepared, if so many had been present.
 It makes me cringe to merely think of it.
 The elders were there, though.
 My father and the others waited in the throne room, arranging a celebration.
 I had read everything I could obtain on the process during my pregnancy and imprisonment in the castle, even finding a few books and scrolls on humans.

Human development strategies focus on improving the welfare and capacities of the individual through better health, education, political choice and economic opportunity.
 Together they encompass the two basic components of all development personal and institutional, individual and collective.
 The challenge is to develop simultaneously both individual and social capacities and utilize their potentials in a complementary manner.
 For the individual, development involves acquisition of greater know ledge, more progressive attitudes, improved skills and higher values.
 For the collective, development involves establishment of more useful and productive institutions, systems, organizations and cultural values.
 The conventional view that development is essentially a function of scarce economic inputs must give way to the perception that the opportunities and potentials for rapid development far exceed actual achievements in every country.
 Looking back over the past few decades, we realize that the speed of social progress could certainly have been much greater than it was.
 The tremendous potential for accelerating development is most easily illustrated by in stances in which actual achievements substantially excelled expectations, such as the enormous leap in world agriculture during the 1960s and 1970s and the phenomenal growth of incomes, employment and exports in East Asia during the last ten years.
 These unforeseen accomplishments reflect the magnitude of potentials that these countries possessed but had not previously utilized.
 The untapped resources of the society can be categorized under several headings:

ls, the first is the92m accumulation0m of the physical capacity, the92m utilization0m of92m labor0m and materials, utilization of materials and productive material resources, and goods, services, goods and productive materials inputs, goods and services and utilization of goods and services and goods and useful and productive materials and services, and utilizing productive material resources, utilization of useful and productive materials and. and, utilization of materials and materials, goods and services92m and0m goods and material inputs.92m The0m second is the accumulation of the intellectual capacity

‚ÄúAnd I love the feel of all the magic.

 It is hard to sleep on a wild line.
 It is going to be hard to stay here for long.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs deep voice had the tone of making a simple observation, not conversation.
 Rodregas nodded; he had been waiting for the comment, but he had thought it would be Imeralda who brought it up.
 ‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúunless you have a way of smoothing it out.‚Äù Rodregas waited for a few seconds as the three approached the main farmhouse building.
 The walls were of thick cut stone and it was built on an impressive scale for a farmhouse, though worn-looking.
 Of course, there were no signs of a roof, doors or windows.
 As they entered the yard, the feeling of the hair standing up on their bodies settled down and instead a feeling of fullness replaced it.
 The horses had been acting up and Rodregas hoped that with the energy smoothing out, the horses would stop fighting their lines.

They went dancing, and in the middle of the floor was a young actor from one of the newer shows.
 He was the center of attention, making all sorts of wacky dance moves.
 Occasionally he'd draw one of the girls from the crowd surrounding him and dance with her for a minute or two.
 To Marie's astonishment and euphoric delight, he grabbed her hand and pulled her into the center of the crowd to dance with him.
 "Did you see that?
 Did you see us?"
 Marie exclaimed breathlessly when she returned to Rick.
 "He danced with me!

Collective and coordinated international action is essential to address this problem.
 Despite past failures, new efforts must be made to revive international commodity agreements, preferably covering both producing and consuming countries.
 This will be possible only if developing countries first arrive at a consensus approach among themselves, including the economic costs and benefits, and a financing plan.
 Financing for international commodity stocks could be supplied partly by producer countries in the form of building national stocks under collective supervision.
 Partly, it could come from bank commercial loans against commodity collateral, loans from regional development banks, the World Bank and IMF's Buffer Stock Facility, which has remained almost unused.
 8.Technology transfer: Accelerate transfer of technology to and between developing countries.
 One or more profit-making commercial organizations should be established as a public sector joint venture of developing countries to promote the commercial transfer of technology to, within and between developing countries and to channel the profits from this activity toward research in these countries.
 9.Global employment model: Our efforts to promote employment are constrained by a lack of detailed knowledge of how global labour markets actually work.
 We still do not understand the impact of technology, trade, macro-economic policies, multinational corporations, shifting patterns of foreign investment and many other factors on job creation, and our ignorance severely hampers effective policy formulation and coordination.
 An international research programme should be organized under the ILO to construct a truly global employment model that monitors the impact of technological developments, expanding world trade, plant closings, movement of industry to low-wage countries, agriculture-led industrialization, economic growth, immigration policies, refugee movements and other factors affecting employment opportunities around the world.

Dragging along behind him as he slowly worked his way through a third of the school was extremely boring.
 I honestly couldn't think of a less entertaining way to spend an evening, but I wasn't ready to join the dancers.
 Most of them seemed to be rapidly losing key items of clothing, and all of them were dancing so close it was hard to tell where one person ended and the other began.
 As Brandon handed me another cup of beer, which I started slowly pouring out on the ground as soon as his back was turned, the loneliness really started to hit me.
 It would be bearable if I had a friend other than Brandon.
 It might even be fun to sit back and laugh at some of the antics making an appearance as people got more and more wasted.
 Instead I was stone cold sober, and the next best thing to completely friendless.
 About the time Vincent tapped the second keg, Brandon looked over at me and flashed a thoughtful smile.
 I would've said nothing could've made up for the last two hours, but it came remarkably close.
 "I'm sorry, this isn't any fun for you, is it?"

They'd secretly talk about all of the people they knew who'd lost family members and been okay after a few weeks, or a couple of months.
 How even at their worst, those friends hadn't collapsed at the mention of their departed loved ones.
 My pulse was already almost twice as fast as normal, and the room was just starting to wobble from side to side.
 Rachel was saying something, but I couldn't really hear her.
 The void was gaping below me, when something grabbed my shoulder and shook me surprisingly hard.
 I opened my eyes to see Rachel looking at me.
 "I'm sorry I had to do that, Adriana, but you need to hear what I have to say."
 Half of me wanted to be angry, but the other half just wanted to collapse into the void.
 Force of habit won over anger and I passively let my defenses crumble, but apparently being shocked out of a collapse functioned much the same as having just come out of an attack.
 For the next few seconds at least I was safe, could think about anything I wanted without fear of the repercussions.

He was devastated to see the condition of his property but he was strangely calm and understanding.
 He simply wanted our help to get Brandon‚Äôs belongings out of his house and fix things as best we could.
 He gave us an offer we couldn‚Äôt refuse.
 If we would get everything out by the evening and pull out all of the carpet, he would not pursue damages.
 None of us were prepared for what we saw when we turned the key in the lock and opened the door.
 Paper and cardboard blackened the windows.
 When we removed these window covers, we found broken panes behind them.
 The bedroom doors had been kicked in, and broken bongs and stem pipes, empty cigarette packs, matchbooks, just trash littered every surface.

My mouth nearly hit the ground when I recognized the throaty roar and dark paint job of Brandon's Mustang.
 "I knew you'd be sitting here worrying she wouldn't come."
 It took a minute for the words to make sense.
 "Fine, but that doesn't shed any light on why you're all the way out here."
 The gray eyes just visible in the slowly growing light crinkled up in a smile.
 "I called her and told her I'd pick you up.
 She can take you home, I'll come pick you up every morning."
 My head was spinning.
 Why would the most popular boy in school want to pick me up for school every morning?

Having just finished up Pride and Prejudice for the third time, I was once again due to try and make it through the written inspiration to some of my favorite music.
 I hardly noticed the slow journey into town, instead caught up in a different time and place as Valjean's story started to unfold.
 All too soon, the bus pulled up to a medium-sized, two-story brick building, and five kids my age stood up to leave.
 I followed them, my heart beating a little faster with each step.
 Other kids were trickling over to the door, either from one of the other two buses, or from the smattering of cars in the parking lot.
 Before we'd even made it inside I'd realized just how much I stuck out.
 Shorts seemed to be the order of the day, knee-length khakis for the boys, and everything from mid-thigh on up for the girls.
 The only people in jeans seemed to be the debate-club types.
 Silently groaning at my fashion faux pas, I located a sign pointing towards the office, and slipped around a couple of jocks who paused in their manly mock boxing match just long enough to check out the new girl.
 I silently hoped they slipped and hit each other in the nose.

 Revising
 While I‚Äôm writing all this from notes and memory, I decide to pick up my old hardback of Big Sur.
 I still get moved by Jack Kerouac‚Äôs honesty and his pictures of the raw and terrifying beauty of people and things.
 After reading about a drive from Big Sur into Monterrey, I go online and look up pictures of the two real people (to whom the book gives other names) on that drive, Kerouac and Neal Cassady.
 Both men were remarkably handsome, some of God‚Äôs finest art, I think.
 Then I remember a character from Ken Kesey‚Äôs Sometimes a Great Notion, and I realize that Kesey may have used Neal Cassady, a fellow of wild intellect and passion, and a legendary womanizer, as a prototype for his character Joe Ben.

The idea of lying alone in the dark, in the very room I'd just seen Brandon demolish, sent my heart into an erratic rhythm.
 If there'd been an EMT present they'd have already been charging up the defibrillator.
 Alec turned around while I was still trying to get my throat to work again.
 "You stopped breathing.

 The tears his touch had dried up a few seconds before were back, and just seconds away from escaping the corners of my eyes by the time I finally pulled myself up onto my knees and managed to speak.
 "Please don't send me there.

 There was just enough moonlight trickling into the room for me to see his expression change.

Like today, when I find myself delivered far beyond the ordinary, into a realm where the glory of simple hills and pastures, of cows and bluebirds, is such that I know why the prophets described heaven as jeweled and paved in gold.
 Father Zossima in The Brothers Karamazov relates this kind of beauty.
 Before his conversion, in the aftermath of a duel, ‚Äú‚ÄôGentlemen,‚Äô I cried suddenly, speaking straight from my heart, ‚Äòlook around you at the gifts of God, the clear sky, the pure air, the tender grass, the birds; nature is beautiful and sinless, and we, only we, are sinful and foolish, and we don‚Äôt understand that life is heaven, for we have only to understand that and it will at once be fulfilled in all its beauty, and we shall embrace each other and weep.‚Äô‚Äù
 Darkness
 For the first time in weeks, a deep sadness grips me.
 Where is it coming from, I wonder?
 After a while, I give up wondering and pray for an answer.
 When no answer arrives, I decide to track my thoughts backward, which leads me to the source, which was a recognition that I had lived much of my life in the aftermath of a grievous mistake.
 If I hadn't been so stubborn, if I had trusted God from the time I first believed, I might've spent all these years in a richer world, maybe not living every moment in the kingdom of heaven, but residing close enough so I could visit more regularly.
 And I might've done a lot of good for other people.

Other nations are reluctant to assume the greater responsibilities that a clearly enunciated doctrine might impose on them.
 All would agree, however, that neither an infinite fragmentation of nation states along ethnic, cultural, religious or linguistic lines, nor a blind indifference to persecution or unconscionable neglect of its own citizens by a state government, can be justified by either reason or lofty legal principles, or be permitted by the human heart and conscience to go unchecked.
 The UN is precluded under article 2(7) of the Charter from intervening in ‚Äòmatters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state‚Äô.
 It must be possible to define objective criteria for identifying instances in which action in apparent disregard of this provision is fully justified.
 The deaths of hundreds of thousands of people in Rwanda and Somalia due to famine, ethnic strife and civil war surely qualify, even if errors in the method of intervention, and lack of public support among nations asked to contribute troops, complicate these precedent-setting initiatives.
 The sovereignty of a nation derives ultimately from the fact that it represents the will of its own people and the right of those people to freedom of action over their own lives and territory.
 National sovereignty is limited on two sides: on the one, by the inalienable human rights of a country‚Äôs citizens and, on the other, by the rights of other member nations of the world community and the citizens they represent.
 In past centuries the sovereignty of nations may have been based on the principle that might is right.
 In our more enlightened age, however, the only acceptable basis for a nation‚Äôs sovereignty is that it expresses the will of its own people, and this condition can only be met under a freely chosen form of government that enables people to express their own free will and determine their own destiny.

I felt my heart skip another beat.
 Everything good that I'd attributed to Brandon had been Alec all along.
 I didn't understand what I'd seen a few hours ago, but he wasn't a monster.
 The amount of hurt in his voice took him out of the category of frightening.
 I moved a little closer.
 "Do you still want me to leave?"
 "Do you want to leave?
 I won't stop you if you do.
 If you can convince your mom to leave town there's even a chance you'll be safe from Brandon."
 Shivers worked their way down my spine as some of the pieces clicked into place.

He could barely see a bow and part of a hand.
 Qurrah waited.
 The Neldaren warriors charged, hoping to overwhelm their opponents before arrows took them all.
 The elf in the window leaned out to unleash a killing strike, but it was Qurrah who did the killing.
 Four pieces of bone leapt from his hand.
 They hit the elf‚Äôs neck and temple, making a satisfying crack.
 The archer spilled through the window and landed with a clattering thud.
 ‚ÄúThe rest are yours, brother,‚Äù he whispered.

He shivered as a skull sailed just above them, its screech turning to chaotic laughter.
 The sound raced up and down his spine, triggering fear no matter how irrational.
 Qurrah watched as if immune to the sound.
 He was so much smaller than Harruq, his slender body wrapped in rags, thin flesh clinging to bone.
 Yet he was unafraid.
 Shame and embarrassment burned in Harruq‚Äôs cheeks.
 He towered over his brother, his hands beefy and arms muscular.
 Nothing should scare him.
 He was supposed to be Qurrah‚Äôs protector, not the other way around.

There was a scattered chorus of badly stifled giggles off to the front of the class.
 Not the normal kind people use when they're amused, but the high-pitched ones girls use to embarrass each other.
 Alec's face unexpectedly softened for a moment, his expression still unwelcoming, but now mixed with a trace of something else.
 While I was busy trying to understand the sudden change, Mrs. Alexander looked at the front of the class with a frown on her face for a moment.
 I suddenly realized that she knew the difference between the two kinds of giggles.
 That was unusual in someone so old.
 The younger teachers usually kept the girls from being too awful to each other, but the old guard didn't really catch the subtle differences high-school girls used to emotionally traumatize each other.
 Her kindly face taking on a stern cast, Mrs. Alexander turned back to Alec.
 "I'm sure you'll enjoy working with Miss Paige, Alec.
 After all, you can't really expect to do everything by yourself.

It had been almost a day since Seth disappeared.
 A day since Kojas took him.
 I had told him, when he had first said that Kojas wanted to use him that he didn‚Äôt have to worry.
 I should have known that Kojas would do anything to get him, and now Seth was gone.
 After he had been taken and Jason had awakened, the faery jerks had scattered.
 Then a light pixie had showed up, the same one who had saved my life a while ago, and led us all the way to her majesty‚Äôs place.
 She was apparently the queen but she was nothing like a stuck up royal leader.
 She was more like a warrior who lead Igneeria in the ‚Äògood times.‚Äô She was really nice but when we had met her, I was in an awful mood.
 No one blamed me; I had just watched one of my best friends get beat up and taken right before my eyes.

They were unrelenting that Brandon owed them a bust, no matter their mistake.
 My son sat there with me and he was not only very ill, he had an obvious broken nose (about which the officers did not inquire‚ÄîI know they had their theories) and Brandon was still very addicted to Oxy.
 Brandon was smoking these pills at a heavy clip.
 He had started his habit by taking the pills orally, then snorting them; finally he had escalated to burning them on foil while inhaling the fumes through a stem pipe.
 Although the next step was slamming or injecting in his veins, he hadn‚Äôt gone that far.
 He was up to about thirty Oxy pills a day and couldn‚Äôt sell enough to supply his habit.
 While he had been living on less since his home lock-down, he was really never clean during this detox.
 How was Brandon going to achieve what these cops wanted in his condition and with his new reputation as a snitch?

"Being able to kiss the man I love whenever I want instead of having to wait for him to kiss me."
 "You can kiss me any time, anywhere you want."
 He nibbled on her neck.
 "Day or night."
 He touched the tip of his tongue to the hollow of her throat.
 Marie caught her breath, clutching at Rick's shoulders.
 Her fingers dug into them as his tongue traced a path up her throat to her chin and then to her mouth, teasing her lips until she gripped the back of his head to pull it to hers, needing his mouth hard on hers.
 Rick's kiss was passionate, possessive.
 Alternately he savored the taste and feel of her and then devoured her, feeling her passion and hunger grow.
 Almost without thinking, he slipped his hand inside her blouse just to touch the soft skin of her midriff, but he withdrew it when he heard her gasp.

"Nope," I said.
 "If we wait, we probably won't go."
 Cliff was more sensible.
 He said my mom could be right.
 I didn't relent until after his mom lectured us in practically the same words.
 Whatever the meaning of Eric‚Äôs death, it might've been losing him that convinced me to give up on Karen Flagstad.
 Anymore, the whole idea of having a best friend spooked me.
 Better to keep my secret life to myself and guard my heart than to trust somebody I was almost sure to lose---because that was how life worked---and mourn over.
 But then, in that way life has of confusing every issue, Karen invited me to be her graduation partner, which meant only walking side-by-side in a procession.
 Still I invited her to the prom.

Their beady dark, red eyes sent shivers down my spine.
 I slung my bow back over my shoulder and grabbed my hunter's knife from its sheath on my side.
 One stopped and raised its head up towards me.
 It opened its mouth to reveal rows of sharp, yellow fangs.
 A chuckle escaped its mouth.
 ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do with that, half-ling?‚Äù it said with a voice that sent needles into my skin.
 ‚ÄúA knife won't do a thing against something like me.‚Äù I almost listened to the thing and started to lower my weapon but I caught myself.
 My hands started to shake.
 Its eyes glistened with hunger.
 ‚ÄúYou can't even hold a weapon.

 Harruq grumbled, but when she frowned and crossed her arms the normal defiance in him melted away.
 He plopped down and sighed.
 ‚ÄúSomething must be wrong with me,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúShut up and start telling me more about yourself.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt understand why I had bothered dragging it along, but my grip on it was tight.

I just said it because a father does whatever he can do to help his son.
 At least that is what I had always thought and that is what I had always done.
 Brandon looked at me as if he wanted to stop me but he lacked the clarity to speak, desperation the only thing evident on his weary face.
 The days since Brandon‚Äôs arrest had been some of the toughest days of his life.
 We know that the practice of turning your busted drug users and dealers into snitches was nothing new in the world of illegal drug distribution.
 I had consumed my fair share of drugs and wasn‚Äôt just some innocent bystander.

 Maybe this was somehow Karma.
 They certainly don‚Äôt have a book that can teach you how to be a good father and my own experiences as a son and a stepson had only given me insight on what not to do as a father.
 Even if this magical book did exist that could help you raise the perfect child, I assume that the chapter titled, ‚ÄúHow to Do a Drug Bust for Your Son‚Äù would be absent.

Restructuring the UN
 The formation of the International Commission on Peace & Food was conceived in 1987, a time when mutual suspicions, escalating military expenditure and confrontational Cold War rhetoric blinded the world to the possibility of radically transforming the global security environment.
 Yet, fuelled by the bold initiatives of Mikhail Gorbachev, by the time ICPF conducted its first meeting on the border of the rapidly vanishing Iron Curtain at Trieste in September 1989, the Berlin Wall had fallen, Cold War hostilities had melted, and the prospect of ushering in a more peaceful and prosperous world for all seemed within reach.
 The euphoria of those heady days generated high expectations of a peace dividend that would help to wipe away much of the world‚Äôs suffering.
 At the same time, the withdrawal of the confrontation between East and West resulted in a gradual shift of attention from the threat of imminent global self-destruction to lesser but very real problems, among them ‚Äì the unresolved danger arising from huge stockpiles of nuclear weapons; some 26 on-going localized military conflicts within and between developing nations, aggravated by increased trafficking in small armaments; the persistence of hunger and malnutrition, especially among the poorest populations of South Asia and politically unstable regions of Africa; progressively rising levels of unemployment in both industrialized and developing countries; and the turbulence and hardship of political, economic and social transition in post-Communist Eastern Europe.
 These challenges, coupled with the outbreak of the first Gulf War, the disintegration of Yugoslavia, and the horrendous civil wars that wracked Somalia and Rwanda, clouded the world‚Äôs vision of a brighter future.
 It was in this context that the Commission undertook five years of research that led to the publication of its report in the fall of 1994.
 The report was released at official functions at UN headquarters in New York, UNESCO in Paris, a global congress of the World Academy of Art and Science at Minneapolis, and in the restored capital of a reunited Germany at Berlin, then formally presented to the UN Secretary General and to all UN member nations by a member of the Commission, Her Majesty Queen Noor on behalf of the Government of Jordan.
 In the decade since then, much has happened to belie the expectations of post-Cold War optimists and pessimists alike.
 On the positive side, the sudden emergence and explosive growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web have fuelled a global revolution in communication, education, economy and a wide range of human activities reaching from corporate board rooms in North America to rural towns and villages on every continent, abridging the time, distance and differences separating countries, classes and people.

He read the material more carefully, and then he reread it.
 He was actually rather relieved that he didn't have to read about her husband and children, but it seemed odd that the pages hadn't changed when she'd gone back.
 He snorted, shaking his head.
 What was really odd was that the pages had changed to begin with, that the information about her marriage had disappeared when she'd walked into 2011.
 And that, of course, had been the biggest oddity of all.
 Still, she had come 84 years into the future, and the parts about her husband and children had disappeared.
 He'd been sure that the pages had changed because her 84-year trip would affect the choices she was to make in 1927, so it made sense, now that she'd gone back to 1927, that those pages would change again to include the name of her husband or at least something about her adult life.
 Shaking his head, he put the papers back.
 He'd never know what had happened to her.
 Maybe, eventually, not knowing-- Rick staggered, everything suddenly going black.

‚ÄúWhat do you say we water the horses?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt have to ask my horse to kneel; Steed just grabbed my waist and threw me up.
 He was mounted before I had settled into the saddle and our horses took off, galloping north in synchronization.
 I looked back for Chevelle.
 He was leaning forward, legs nearly straight in the stirrups as his stallion raced to catch us.
 We were covering distance so quickly I could barely take in the new surroundings.
 It wasn‚Äôt long before we came up on a wide creek.
 I assumed Steed had control of my horse; I was simply concentrating on staying in the saddle as we ran beside him.
 The horses edged closer to the creek, splashing along the muddy bank and then the shallows of the water.
 Silt and cold water sprayed my face as we ran.
 I wondered if this was what it felt like to fly like the fairies.

And then, another time, when I decided to actually find a church I would go to more than once or twice, was on account of feeling quite blessed and knowing I ought to be spending more time thanking God than I ever would on my own.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow did you know which church to pick?‚Äù Such a question calls for more coffee.
 I pour a cup and say, ‚ÄúWell, the evangelical ones were where I found more people who actually tried to get closer to God.
 You know, to better understand God through all kinds of means.
 Intellect and others.
 I mean, I‚Äôm all for preachers showing how Biblical advise can help us be nicer, more prosperous, more benevolent, more likely to work toward human rights and all.
 But without the honest search for connection with the Holy Spirit, none of that good advice carries much weight.‚Äù
 Eric vs. Max Von Sydow
 Back on the road my thoughts pick up where they left off in San Luis Obispo, and I wonder if Brother Lawrence perceived his constant companion as the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit.
 Maybe my problem with adoring God is my habit of looking at, or for, God the Father, who in my vocabulary is easy to respect, admire, stand in awe of, or even worship, but is hard for me to adore.
 God, to me, looks more like a vapor.

Unfortunately Mr. Simms was possibly the worst teacher I'd ever had.
 I mentally shrugged when we were told to open our books and read the chapter to ourselves.
 At least I wouldn't have any worries when it came to catching up in this class.
 Thoughts of Brandon made it hard to really get into the chapter.
 Also, it was hard not to notice the borderline hostile stares from the other kids.
 I sighed in relief when the bell rang, and pulled out my schedule and map to see where I'd be going next.
 Physics?
 I mentally reviewed my conversation with the secretary, but couldn't remember either of us mentioning the class.
 As if trying to catch up in Algebra wasn't going to be bad enough, I was going to face the same kind of problem in physics.

 The past is very much driving what's happening right now, but so much of the past is tied up with the very things from which Alec's trying to protect you."
 I was bubbling with questions, but sensing that now wasn't the time to push, I sat back and waited in silence while she decided exactly how much to tell me.
 "Alec's father was killed nearly two decades ago.
 I don't remember everything about that night, I wasn't even conscious for a large part of the happenings, but the pieces I do remember are sharper than they should be.

You appeared to be an Immortalist Sorcerer and I have grown to hate the Immortalists.
 When it became clear that you were not, I stopped trying to kill you.‚Äù He paused at this, and then Rodregas could tell he made a decision.
 ‚ÄúYou have given me a sword, if a small one, and among my people that is a powerful gesture.
 I will not lie to you, I have left my old life behind and the last few years I have learned to truly hate the Immortalists.
 I travel with you only because the others were going to go back to their homes, and I have no home to go back to,‚Äù he seemed to finish, but then added, ‚ÄúLast night you pointed out that the forces of the Immortalists would be after you and you would fight them.
 And you also proved that you can fight.‚Äù Once again he paused.
 He was clearly a man that liked to think before he spoke.
 ‚ÄúI am simply using you as bait.
 When they come for you, I will kill them.
 Fighting together we will kill some of their vaulted Immortal Guards.‚Äù As Doi‚Äôvan finished he gave a low growl and shook his horned head, his thick mane of wild jet black hair was almost as distinctive as Imeralda‚Äôs own auburn flowing locks.

We instantly noticed his weight gain and he proudly announced through our open car window that he was nearing 170 pounds, and he looked healthy for the first time in so many years.
 His complexion was clear and his eyes were the bright blue they once were and the whites of his eyes were shinny and clear.
 Brandon could hardly wait for us to open the car door and he embraced each of us as if he hadn‚Äôt seen us in years.
 I know I hadn‚Äôt seen him like this in years.
 He held me so tightly and so long.
 He hadn‚Äôt hugged me like that since he was a young child.
 Our son shared a 12 by 12 foot room and one bathroom with 3 people.
 One of his roommates was my age.
 This was no celebrity rehab for sure.
 It did have a nice pool area and a sauna, which they used in a detoxification program designed to rid the body of drugs and residue, Brandon explained.

The pages directly from the record-keeper‚Äôs report all included the same Council mark plus a string of characters.
 Trying to decode them, I realized one of the symbols might simply be a page number.
 And the others, they were probably locators.
 I felt like a fool.
 They were just like the codes used in the library, only more elaborate.
 No one really used the ciphers, you didn‚Äôt need them with magic, but they had been added to many of the pages when the fairies had started tracking clan histories.
 I was holding in my hand the information I needed to find the northern clans in the Council‚Äôs library.

But he could never admit that to Lauri; she'd accuse him of being a romantic.
 He really was, deep down, he supposed.
 But he'd had so many bad experiences that he was rapidly becoming something of a cynic.
 He'd thought he'd been in love with Sabrina, but she'd been too demure, too clingy.
 He'd begun feeling smothered.
 Gina had talked of nothing but marriage from their fifth or sixth date until he'd broken up with her.
 She'd sobbed and told him over and over how much she loved him and begged him not to break up with her.
 A month later he'd read of her engagement to another man.
 He'd actually proposed to Kim, but once she had the ring, all she'd wanted to talk about was what pieces she was going to buy to refurnish the house and at which resorts they were going to spend their summers and how much of his money was in the bank and how much in land investments.
 He'd broken up with her six weeks after proposing.

Steed smiled in acceptance, but not the same smile he‚Äôd given his last opponent.
 They stood across from each other and readied themselves.
 Both tensed but neither took the low, wide stance previously used.
 As their eyes fixed on one another, I felt myself, and Ruby beside me, lean forward in anticipation of action.
 Both men went taut, their muscles corded, jaws clenched tight, determined stares focusing only on each other.
 I saw nothing happen but knew there must be something, some unseen force causing them pain, draining them.
 I couldn‚Äôt look away but stammered to Ruby, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey are trying to overpower one another.‚Äù I could hear the pleasure in her voice.
 ‚ÄúNo silly games, just power.‚Äù The way she said it had some part of my mind wondering whether her statement about not having her mother‚Äôs ambition was true.

The key lies within us.
 Some Common Challenges
 Listing future achievements does not mitigate the very real and pressing problems that confront us now.
 A brief catalogue suffices to indicate the magnitude of these challenges.
 Population: In spite of the continued decline in birth rates, world population is expected to rise by nearly three billion people or 50 per cent over the next three decades, making the task of achieving food security, employment and education for all even more daunting than it is today.
 Poverty: The incidence of poverty continues to increase both in relative and absolute terms.
 Presently, 1.4 billion people, constituting 26 per cent of the total population of developing and developed nations, live in poverty.
 The poorest 20 per cent of the world‚Äôs population share a minuscule 1.4 per cent of the world‚Äôs income.
 According to current projections, 300 million people, representing nearly 50 per cent of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, will live below the poverty line at the turn of the century.
 Environment: Unsustainable lifestyles and consumption (in industrial countries) and population growth, along with rising levels of production and consumption (in developing countries), will place strenuous demands on the environment of the planet.

l resources of the solar system: Earth is a system of the sea,92m earth0m, air92m,0m water, air, the sea, ocean, and earth. Energy: The92m natural0m resources of electricity, wind power, heat, and hot water are critical resources for the ageing earth.

She took scissors from a drawer and reached for a lock on the back of her head.

 He walked silently at her side.
 When they were back inside, she didn't go upstairs to change.
 Instead, she went to the living room and sat in a corner of the sofa, erecting an invisible wall between them.

It is the result of human aspirations turned into action, human energies expressed in thought and work, human imagination and creativity turned toward the upliftment of life, the invention of processes and products to enhance human productivity, the accumulation of knowledge and wisdom passed on from one generation to another, the acquisition and perfection of skills transmitted from parent to child, the conversion of talents into capacities, the pursuit of ideals, an ever widening of attitudes, and the evolution of more complex and productive forms of organization.
 As this evolutionary process unfolds, each element of human personality -- physical skill, vital relationship, mental understanding, spiritual values ‚Äì is enhanced in a progression without end, bringing with it greater material fruits, richer life experience, and higher knowledge.
 The unfolding and flowering of the human being is at once the source and the goal of development.
 Thus, in all our efforts to elevate human society, our primary endeavour must be to enhance these human endowments and expand individual freedom of self-expression.
 Peace, democracy, employment opportunities, food security, education, training, access to information, cooperation, freedom of action and a spirit of innovation are the essential conditions and means for this process to advance.
 There was a time when humanity‚Äôs progress was primarily the result of the collective efforts of the community, demanding and obtaining the strict obedience and conformity of its individual members to preserve what it had created and further the progress of the collective.
 That point is now past.
 In the century now commencing, the individual human being must come into his own as a free and creative force.
 The groundwork has been prepared by the spread of democracy, human rights, universal education, gender and social equality and, more recently, information empowerment.
 The power of individual awakening is responsible for the revolution of rising expectations that has fuelled unprecedented rates of growth and social transformation during the past half century.

They had grown fuzzy around their edges; it‚Äôs difficult to describe how they clung to each other in a desperate way as if they didn‚Äôt know where one ended and the other began.

The official figure is around 6.4 per cent in the United States, but the actual number, including those who have given up seeking jobs, is probably above 10 per cent.
 More than 35 million Americans, constituting 14 per cent of the population, are living on incomes below the poverty line, including 30 per cent of all blacks and Hispanics.
 Western European unemployment rates are at the highest level in 30 years.
 They are projected soon to reach 12 per cent or 18 million people and remain high throughout the decade, prompting the outgoing European Union President, Jacques Delors, to call employment Europe‚Äôs ‚ÄòAchilles heel‚Äô.
 Youth unemployment rates (aged 16‚Äì19) in the European Community average nearly 20 per cent and nearly 50 per cent of the unemployment is long-term (more than one year).
 The emerging situation poses a challenge to the European concept of the welfare state.
 Employment in Eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union has been severely disrupted by the break-up of COMECON, the dissolution of the USSR and the movement of these countries from centrally planned to market economies.
 From the beginning of 1990 to March 1992, registered unemployment grew from 100,000 to over 4 million and it has continued to rise steeply since then.
 The unemployment rate for ten Eastern European countries now averages around 17 per cent.
 Recent projections indicate that jobless ness in Russia could reach 15 million persons or 18 per cent of the work-force in the near future.

ent in the Republic92m of0m Eastern Europe and former Soviet republic Russia is also92m rising0m sharply and the unemployment rate is at92m the0m highest level in the92m whole0m of the EU since 1991. The decline in the EU is due to changes in the structure of the population of Europe and also to the dissolution and further collapse of the Soviet Union. The independence of Chechnya and the92m collapse0m of the former Soviet Union have also contributed to the increase in levels of unemployment in Russia.<eop> The unemployment rate in the European Union is at its highest level

Financing for international commodity stocks could be supplied partly by producer countries in the form of building national stocks under collective supervision.
 Partly, it could come from bank commercial loans against commodity collateral, loans from regional development banks, the World Bank and IMF's Buffer Stock Facility, which has remained almost unused.
 8.Technology transfer: Accelerate transfer of technology to and between developing countries.
 One or more profit-making commercial organizations should be established as a public sector joint venture of developing countries to promote the commercial transfer of technology to, within and between developing countries and to channel the profits from this activity toward research in these countries.
 9.Global employment model: Our efforts to promote employment are constrained by a lack of detailed knowledge of how global labour markets actually work.
 We still do not understand the impact of technology, trade, macro-economic policies, multinational corporations, shifting patterns of foreign investment and many other factors on job creation, and our ignorance severely hampers effective policy formulation and coordination.
 An international research programme should be organized under the ILO to construct a truly global employment model that monitors the impact of technological developments, expanding world trade, plant closings, movement of industry to low-wage countries, agriculture-led industrialization, economic growth, immigration policies, refugee movements and other factors affecting employment opportunities around the world.
 10.Shift focus of technological development: The number of jobs created or destroyed by technology depends on the priority given to various objectives in the process of technological development.
 Presently, there is an in-built bias in technological R & D towards replacing human labour with capital and energy, even when similar levels of quality and efficiency could be achieved by alternative means.
 A conscious shift of focus could lead to the development of more labour-intensive production processes.

ce labour costs, we need to develop more efficient labour intensive92m production0m processes, to92m reduce0m or eliminate the use of labour for labour92m intensive0m production processes92m.0m In addition, when the development of technology increases the efficiency of labour-intensive production processes, the use of energy can be reduced, to increase the efficiency of production and to increase the value of energy and the cost of labour in order to further reduce92m the0m effect of labour costs. 11.

 We turned around to see you being mauled by a Thrasher.
 Before either of us could do anything, some light appeared out of nowhere.
 When it died down, we found you lying on the ground unconscious.
 That‚Äôs basically it.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know what the light was.‚Äù Emily added.
 ‚ÄúBut whatever it was, it saved your life.‚Äù ‚ÄúUh I have a feeling I should thank it, but I don‚Äôt know how you thank light.‚Äù I muttered.
 ‚ÄúYou thank it like you would thank anyone else,‚Äù A voice said.
 I almost jumped to the moon in surprise.
 Out of nowhere someone, or something, appeared beside Jason.

 Marie would be embarrassed if she thought Teri and Jeremy had seen them kissing.
 "Mmm."
 She kissed him again.
 Rick returned her kiss and then gently disengaged her arms.
 "It's getting late.

 He helped her into the car.
 "I think I like 1927 cars better than 2011 cars," Marie said as Rick slid behind the wheel.

 Alec looked back up at me, and his eyes were filled with incredible need.
 I was suddenly struck by the similarities to the me he'd painted, and what I saw written on his face.
 It seemed impossible he would be unsure, that a glorious being like him could ever need anything I could provide, but I couldn't deny it was there.
 There was no way of knowing what it was, but I didn't care.
 Whatever it was he needed I wanted to give him.
 I opened my mouth to say as much, but my vocal chords wouldn't cooperate.

Of course Rodregas had known that in The Immortal Guard of the Guild the most loyal and powerful of their officers were given enhanced bodies, but he thought their power lay in their magical sigils.
 His new body was very large and very muscular, and much stronger than he would have guessed.
 Rodregas lifted his right arm and curled it into a tight muscle.
 He felt the biceps with his free hand.
 The texture under the skin felt like bundles of large, powerful cables.
 He felt his face break into a smile; he had seen this face smile when it had been a prisoner.
 The smile the prisoner had worn was a very open charming smile.
 The smile he felt on his face now had little resemblance to the one he remembered seeing, though without looking in the mirror he had no way of knowing for sure.

 Alec nodded in response to Mallory's observation.

 He opened the door to the pantry, and started putting cans away, but Mallory waved him off.
 "You'll put them in the wrong spots.

He thought if he had let her, she would have jumped right on him and slid himself inside her.
 Rodregas knew that Nymphs were legendary for their enjoyment of sex, but he was a little surprised at her eagerness.
 She ran her hands and lips across his chest, seemingly fascinated by ‚Äòhis‚Äô powerful musculature and smooth skin.
 Once again Rodregas found himself pulling away from her touch.
 He had never really had a woman that eager to touch him before.
 Her eagerness to touch his body made him feel a little put off.
 It was good to be touched, in fact, he craved it.
 But her eagerness highlighted to him that the body she wanted to touch was not really his.
 It was the body of Gerald, not Rodregas.
 Her body was everything that he had thought it would be, both wonderfully hard and lush.

In the developing world, more than 80 per cent of the water is utilized for agriculture, an unsustainable level that is depleting water tables, increasing soil salinity and accelerating erosion.
 Although historically water has often been a source of contention between communities, it has never been the cause of an open inter-state conflict.
 However, nearly one-half of the world‚Äôs land surface consists of river basins shared by more than one country and more than 30 nations receive more than one-third of their water from outside their borders.
 Therefore, the danger of confrontation and conflict will escalate unless concerted measures are implemented urgently.
 Water shortages occurring in combination with other sources of tension ‚Äî such as in the Middle East ‚Äî will be particularly worrisome.
 Famine remains a persistent threat precisely because the world no longer feels that threat to be severe.
 India‚Äôs last major famine occurred in Bengal in 1943 during World War II.
 Although the deficit in food production was only marginal that year, three million died for lack of strong administrative intervention to improve distribution.
 A marginal deficit could work havoc in the absence of an efficient and equitable public distribution network.
 While there is no scarcity of food in the world, there is also not a sufficiently organized effort to promote food security, precisely because the sense of urgency is lacking.

ctims92m of0m hunger in the world are the poor inhabitants of the poorest cities and villages, poorest towns and the poorest92m rural0m communities. At the same time, in the developing world, there is a lack in a supply of food for the hungry.<eop> The problem with a shortage of food is that while the92m food0m is92m readily0m available, there is disparity in the supply of it.

In fact, measures which reduce wage incomes could have the perverse effect of reducing aggregate purchasing power and employment.
 Economic growth is recognized as an essential, though not sufficient, condition for higher rates of job growth ‚Äì but fears of inflation constrain industrial countries from trying to stimulate faster expansion of their economies.
 The primary impact of moderate levels of inflation would be to encourage an outflow of investment to more stable currencies.
 How ever, if the industrial nations all agreed to relax their monetary policies, this effect could be minimized.
 The real constraint on job creation in the industrial nations is not the price of labour, but the need for increased capital investment, partly to counter the effects of reduced military spending and the drastic fall in output and demand in Eastern Europe.
 Increasing public investment to stimulate employment is constrained by widespread concern about rising levels of public debt.
 Recent reports state that the gross debt of OECD countries has risen from 35 per cent of GDP in 1970 to 70 per cent in 1993.
 But this figure is of questionable significance.
 The gross debt includes the debt held by government departments and public agencies as well as by private institutions and individuals.
 When the government-held portion is deducted, the actual net debt of these countries is approximately half the gross debt, which means the net interest burden for servicing the debt is also only half.

I felt as though I was drifting.
 The bed no longer mattered, or even seemed to exist.
 All that mattered was the story and the warm drowsiness that increased with each breath.
 "Adjam saw his brother's frustration grow, but he never suspected just how strong it'd become until two hunters brought Inock to bay, and he turned on them.
 Inock killed the first hunter and would have done likewise to the second, but Adjam sprang upon his brother, knocking him away before the second man could be harmed."
 Alec's fingers slowly caressed my stomach as he spoke.
 It should have tickled, but instead it lulled me even further towards oblivion.
 "And thereby the full effect of the Earth's curse was felt.

 Chairs are scattering as they tip over and who knows what those two men in the helicopter are going to do?
 I look up and the only man standing is Grandpa who has his arms in the air as the wind from the copter pounds him and ripples his suit like a flag in the wind.
 This deeply religious (and senile) old man proclaims loudly ‚Äúthe lord has come to take my son!‚Äù and he continues to repeat this line as if he is a TV preacher in a revival tent.
 I have an eye on the copter and a hand on Grandpa‚Äôs leg as I attempt to pull him to the ground with the rest of us.
 People are barely audible but they are screaming and crying and in total panic.
 The men reach inside the helicopter and they hold what appear to be large boxes.

The global debate over the Uruguay Round of GATT has been obscured by lack of clear information regarding its impact on the countries involved.
 International negotiations on debt, aid and the environment are complicated by lack of awareness about the opportunities that greater economic integration will generate for all nations.
 International institutions, non-governmental agencies and the international media play an important role in providing information to the world community, but there are still huge gaps to be filled in all fields.
 A conscious and systematic effort is required at the international level to put in place both the institutions and the technology for information superhighways needed to support peace, democracy and sustainable development in the twenty-first century.
 Building Social Organization for Development
 The achievement of peace, food security and full employment cannot be accomplished without more fully utilizing one of the most creative and productive of all human resources ‚Äì organization.
 The march of humanity is marked by the development of larger-scale, more complex and more efficient types of organizations to serve higher and wider social needs.
 Advances in the technology of organization, as much as advances in the technology of production, have been responsible for global progress during the present century and, especially, during the post-war period.
 We have argued earlier that establishment of effective and lasting peace requires a radical restructuring of the existing institutions for global governance.

 Uncle Dan was a hero to us as he was the only consistent male figure in our life.
 The drive up stations at Bob‚Äôs Big Boy were filled with a variety of Hot Rods and they were in all shapes, colors and sizes.

 It was very unusual in that time period not to have a father.
 Our friends were puzzled by our missing parent, our working mother, and our home with our grandparents.

‚ÄúCome on, blossom,‚Äù Steed teased back, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see what you‚Äôve got.‚Äù At that, Grey disappeared and then, in a flash, was behind Steed, reaching up to smack him in the back of the head.
 The instant before he struck, Steed ducked into a squat and spun, taking Grey‚Äôs legs out from under him.
 I flinched.
 Grey was gone again, this time reappearing midair in a flip above Steed‚Äôs head, reaching down to tag him on the way by.
 It was a loud smack.
 I was sure it had stung.
 Steed stood still, focused on the spot where Grey had landed and was flickering in and out of view.
 I made an effort to consider possible responses in my head, but was coming up blank.
 The nerves were gone.
 I found myself wanting Steed to win and leaned with his strikes, tensing as if they were my own.

Without a universal ban, the efforts of the nuclear powers to stop proliferation lack moral authority.
 Arguments are often advanced that nuclear weapons cannot be ‚Äòdis-invented‚Äô, and that the danger of a rogue state or terrorist group acquiring and threatening use of these weapons necessitates that the present nuclear powers retain them for such a contingency.
 With the massive conventional firepower already available, nuclear weapons are not needed for defence, even against a rogue state with nuclear capability, and they do not represent a credible defence against terrorism under any circumstances.
 How could nuclear weapons conceivably be used to retaliate against terrorism?
 Alternative solutions can be found to address these threats far more effectively.
 Similar arguments were made in the past against complete eradication of chemical weapons.
 The new treaty for the abolition of chemical weapons provides a useful model.
 Chemical weapons technology is far easier to acquire and violations of the treaty are far more difficult to verify.
 The fact that a comprehensive universal treaty to abolish one category of weapons of mass destruction is now a reality proves that political will rather than technical factors is the crucial element.
 The Chemical Weapons Treaty also shows that negotiation of such a treaty need not take decades.

 the complete abolition of chemical weapons is a monumental task, and it requires a long time and effort to92m achieve0m the goal. Eliminating92m one0m92m one0m category of chemical weapons is a goal; however, achieving this goal is difficult in many parts92m of0m the world, and there is no small amount of political support to support the complete elimination of chemical weapons. The achievement of complete elimination of chemical weapons is also a very difficult task, as the security risks are far greater than they are benefits.<eop>92m<eod>0m I‚Äôm

I had seen this tactic with my grandfather and my uncle, and my brother and I were now in a similar situation.
 When someone saw the marks or bruises on our bodies we lied so we didn‚Äôt get a repeat performance.
 Gym teachers or other kids during showers after PE class asked the most questions.
 We just blamed it on each other as a fight between brothers.
 We just learned to live with it and survive.
 We became quite the fighters at school and other kids learned not to screw with us or we would beat them down.
 It was just something one gets good at when one is in constant training.
 My parents‚ÄîI had been instructed to refer to Dino as my father‚Äîentertained a lot.

I shrugged uncomfortably.
 When teachers praised me, it always made me feel like I was socially deficient.
 I didn't necessarily mind the fact that I spent hours more on homework than any of my peers, but being praised for it always felt like a backhanded insult.
 "It's okay, I'm not going to slack off.
 I want to be done with extra assignments as badly as you want to be finished with having to grade them."
 My feeble joke evoked a smile, but I wasn't quite free to go.
 "Well, your homework is easier to grade than most.
 I also wanted to let you know that I'm happy with what you've been doing at the lab, and to give you this."
 As unbelievable as it was considering that most of my classmates seemed more concerned with working their fast-food jobs than with doing homework, the plain envelope she handed me contained my very first paycheck.

The crucial importance of food security to world peace and economic development demands that the international community take collective responsibility and initiative to eradicate hunger and famine on a global basis as a complement to the initiatives of individual countries to deal with the problem domestically.
 The growth of food production in developing countries can be accelerated dramatically by the application of resource-based, location-specific strategies that incorporate a proper blending of traditional and frontier technologies and integrate all the links in the chain of production, processing, transport and distribution.
 Conditions vary too widely from country to country for detailed recommendations to be broadly applied.
 However, a number of strategies are relevant to the majority of developing countries.
 Some of the components of an Action Plan designed to achieve this goal are given below.
 1.Elimination of agricultural trade barriers by industrial nations.
 The agreements reached for liberalizing agricultural trade in the Uruguay Round of GATT are an important step forward, but they will not release the full dynamism of the agricultural sector, which is so critical for more rapid growth of incomes and employment in both developing and developed countries.
 In the previous chapter, we have called for rapid reduction leading to a complete elimination of agricultural subsidies and other trade barriers by industrial nations, which can generate a positive multiplier effect.
 It has been estimated that complete liberalization of trade in agricultural commodities would yield an annual gain (in 1992 dollars) of about $25 billion for OECD countries and $22 billion for developing and formerly centrally planned countries.
 Actual gains could be very much higher.

f food production is often considered a prerequisite to the elimination of hunger in both developed and developing countries, which is the second92m biggest0m problem in the world92m.0m Such a rapid development of food security in both developed and developing countries as the Uruguay Round92m is0m extremely unlikely to92m substantially0m accelerate the growth of food production and food security in developing countries. However, there is still an enormous potential for expanding92m and0m strengthening them.<eop> 2.Correlation of the linkages between food production and food security in developed countries.

 "I believe you'll want to keep this with you at all times.

 And yes, we can most definitely go to one of the libraries.
 In fact, I believe you'll find the smaller one quite satisfactory.

‚ÄúLast night at the arena party you agreed to ask Van‚Äôdret where Oreintvenir is,‚Äù She replied in a clear clipped voice.
 ‚ÄúActually,‚Äù Van‚Äôdret responded, ‚ÄúI think I said that my visit to his solar would be a perfect opportunity to ask him if he knew the location of our missing Grand Master.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo why did you not take advantage of the opportunity?
 If anyone knows where Oreintvenir is; it is Taiga‚Äù ‚ÄúMy lovely Gracella, you are an Immortalist of impressive power and intellect.
 But we are Immortalist, time is on our side and Grand Master Oreintvenir has been gone for less than a year.

 He could be anywhere on this world or beyond it.
 There is no need to be in such a... rush to ask questions.‚Äù ‚ÄúVan‚Äôdret doesn‚Äôt play your word games with me, you know, and I know that this is not a normal disappearance.

 Neither of us would be surprised if Taiga had killed him and taken his place.
 But, then he would simply have called a concave and be elected Guild Master if that was the case.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not suggesting that Taiga is involved in some foul play against the Grand Master are you?‚Äù asked Van‚Äôdret his tone equally outraged and surprised.

 "No worries, it just seemed like the thing to do at the time.
 Why did she want to hurt you anyways?"
 Rachel looked down, but somehow it wasn't a gesture that conveyed guilt.

 Following his instructions, she went to his bathroom and got the lotion.

 ‚ÄúThey are new to the town, and when they came so did the murders,‚Äù he had said.

7.A greater degree of regional cooperation is desirable between states which share natural resources and common environmental interests.
 This is of particular importance where regional peace and stability is at stake, as in the Middle East, over the question of access to water supplies.
 Where national environmental resources may lead to dispute and conflict, agreements should be drawn up between potential belligerents and the good offices of the UN's specialized agencies used to anticipate and avert future conflict.
 Peace and democracy can provide only the foundation for stable and productive social life, not its fulfilment.
 For that, political security has to be complemented by economic security and a blossoming of individual and cultural potentials.
 Yet here our optimism seems to flag.
 Our thoughts of the new millennium do evoke images of greater peace and stability internationally, more individual freedom and democratic rights, growing international co-operation, exciting new technologies, increasing cultural interaction.
 But they also evoke images of more people and less work ‚Äì meaning fewer jobs!
 No sooner has the threat of nuclear annihilation receded, than the spectre of chronic unemployment and unrelenting poverty has risen to replace it, giving renewed justification to humanity‚Äôs deepest anxieties by transferring them to a new source of apprehension.
 In recent years, unemployment has emerged as a major cause of concern for governments around the world.

 of the growing changes occurring in the region, we stress our need92m to0m tackle fundamental problems such as poverty, climate change and food security , and to promote the development92m of0m economic security, and promotion of democracy. . . as the most92m effective0m means92m to0m achieve our shared aims of peace and security. In particular, we have underlined the importance of the promotion of regional democracy, to maintain the region's stability, and to ensure the sustainable development of human life-forms92m.0m<eop> 8

Brandon could trade prison for setting up the double-crosser Steve.
 Officer White was insistent that the time frame for this deal was short.
 Brandon was very ill detoxing, and the fact that he had been busted and he was on lockdown at his parents‚Äô house was common knowledge on the street.
 There‚Äôs no easy way to bluff if everyone sees your cards.
 Officer White cooked up a scheme.
 He gave Brandon a phone number and a story for him to give to Steve.
 Hopefully this story would explain Brandon‚Äôs bust, now known by all of his associates: He was to acknowledge his bust and tell Steve that the cops didn‚Äôt catch him with drugs because no one would front him the Oxy he was to bring to the deal.
 Brandon owed everyone, including Steve, so that would not be difficult to believe.
 In fact, that part was the truth!

 ‚ÄúNo, can‚Äôt say that I ever have.
 The weapons of the Knight are the sword, the mace, the lance and the bow.
 Those are the weapons of a warrior,‚Äù he stated.
 ‚ÄúAnd what do you do when facing a warrior in full plate armor?‚Äù asked Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúEven chain mail can stop an arrow or the edge of a sword.
 And while a mace is great against chain, crushing your opponent and breaking their bones, such tactics take far too long against plate armor.‚Äù Rodregas was not sure what to say to that question.
 The mace or the war hammer was, of course, the weapon of choice against all well armored opponents.

The role of other states, regional organizations and international agencies in giving explicit or implicit support to these movements has further complicated the task of formulating just and practical solutions.
 These events raise questions about the rights of both nations and their citizens that have to be addressed theoretically before the role of international organizations in these affairs can be determined properly.
 Does a minority group within a country have the right to proclaim itself independent on the basis of its desire for self-governance and in defiance of the claims of the majority on the property and resources they possess?
 Does a national government, whether elected or in power by force, that is unable to protect its citizens against famine and civil strife have the right to insist on its sovereignty and independent action in the face of the persecution or extermination of its own people?
 What is the responsibility of the international community for preventing or alleviating crises within societies?
 What should be the limits placed on international involvement in the internal affairs of countries that, at least momentarily, are unable to help themselves?
 The sanctity of the sovereign state, like the sanctity of private property in a capitalist society, is a fundamental principle of the nation state system on which the present world community is based.
 Like the protectors of private property, the guardians of the sovereign state vigorously resist each attempt to limit its scope or qualify its power ‚Äì although in both instances there are obvious and well-recognized limits and qualifications.
 The sensitivity over the issue of sovereignty ‚Äì especially among former colonies and victims of imperialist aggression ‚Äì is quite understandable in view of the fact that the emergence of modern nation states over the last two centuries occurred during a period when imperialist wars and colonial conquests were accepted as part of the normal conduct of international relations.
 It is a measure of the world‚Äôs progress in this century that this standard of conduct is no longer tolerated by the international community.

established solely as a function of the sovereign state, according to applicable international law, of the rights92m of0m the people of nations, and of human rights. It is the moral duty of92m the0m international community to protect, promote and preserve the sovereignty and independence92m of0m nations, and to allow the sovereign to be independent in the interests92m and0m92m the0m interests of its nations and in respect for the rights of its citizens in pursuit of these interests.<eop> Fourthly, the international community‚Äôs duty is to safeguard the sovereign state

 ‚ÄúNo rulers?‚Äù He gave Steed a sidelong glance.

 That pleasure was only one of many that day.
 First she loaded the dishwasher while Rick supervised, and she poured in the soap and started the machine herself.

He ran his lips down the line of her chin.
 Though he was trying to go slowly, they quickly found themselves naked.
 He thought if he had let her, she would have jumped right on him and slid himself inside her.
 Rodregas knew that Nymphs were legendary for their enjoyment of sex, but he was a little surprised at her eagerness.
 She ran her hands and lips across his chest, seemingly fascinated by ‚Äòhis‚Äô powerful musculature and smooth skin.
 Once again Rodregas found himself pulling away from her touch.
 He had never really had a woman that eager to touch him before.
 Her eagerness to touch his body made him feel a little put off.
 It was good to be touched, in fact, he craved it.

I hobbled up a stair or two in an effort to avoid getting in the way.
 I'd heard of tension so thick you could cut it with a knife, but this was the first time I'd ever experienced it.
 It felt like there was electricity surging back and forth between Vincent and Isaac, making my skin feel too small.
 The tension suddenly flickered like a dying light bulb.
 "Vincent!"
 I was disoriented for a second.
 The yell had come from behind me, and had torn the two apart faster than I'd believed possible.
 The crowd, packed so tightly that I'd been worried someone was going to get pushed over the railing, separated as Alec flowed down the stairs.

What lived and has finally died in Eastern Europe is not communism, but statism, the domination of the state and use of state authority to govern the life of the nation, in practice reducing people to forced labour.
 True capitalism, which regards people as a factor of production, passed away more than half a century ago, when the challenge of communism prompted Western societies to incorporate socialist principles and measures to mitigate the blind justice of the free market.
 There are no true capitalist societies in the world.
 There are no free markets.
 The free market system is highly regulated and controlled by the very state over which it claims victory.
 But although in reality both systems are dead, the ideology of the capitalist system lives on and casts an illusory impression of supremacy.
 Rather than searching for a victor and vanquished, the urgent need is to find a successor that combines and synthesizes the enlightened values of both systems ‚Äì freedom and equality, liberty and security.
 It has been amply proved that the authoritarian state is incapable of exerting a benevolent authority over the people without imposing severe restrictions on freedom, stifling human energy and creativity, leading sooner or later to rising discontent and a loss of social vitality.
 It is also abundantly clear that money as an institution operating through the free pricing mechanism of the market system ‚Äì although it does succeed in generating high levels of energy, creativity and productivity ‚Äì regards people as a purchasable commodity or a potential market, but is otherwise indifferent to human values and welfare.
 Neither the determinism of the state nor the determinism of the market can be adequate in themselves to achieve the goals of peace and prosperity that we strive after.

er of the state92m is0m to promote human happiness and peace, but the power of the market92m cannot0m92m destroy0m human peace and human welfare. It is the cruel92m and0m oppressive power of the state to devalue the peace and human, and to destroy the peace and harmony in the lives of people in the world. As a threat to the welfare of the people in the world, it is the gravest and worst threat to the peace and harmony92m,0m the happiness and the security of human people ‚Äì because it threatens

Rumor was that the Guild Master (and maybe Taiga as well) was close to ascension to true godhood.
 Only two Immortalists had ever succeeded in this task.
 The first was the legendary Accerntorino.
 He was said to have created the Immortalist Ascension ritual and to have been a genius without par.
 The first guild master Accerntorino was also known for his ego.
 Within two decades of his accession he challenged the All-Father All√≥d for control of the Celestial Pantheon of the Gods.
 Accerntorino claimed he could better lead them to victory over the Daemon Lords of the Infernal Realm.
 But All√≥d quickly and soundly defeated the upstart Accerntorino.
 What still caused whispers almost 400 years later was his fate; the All-Father had destroyed him.
 Everyone knew stories of various gods that had challenged All√≥d over the millennia.

Clearly they had no magic, and they definitely were the owners of the crude tools we had found.

Korin was interested in the father, a good-looking man.
 The wife was equally beautiful and they had a slim child named Jorin.
 Rodregas had taken Jorin under his wing.
 He had only been working at Raven Keep for a little over a year at the time and was still learning the names of the prisoners.
 Rodregas had thought that Jorin was a good lad, well behaved and bright, and his eyes were eager for signs of hope.
 Rodregas brought him extra food and words of reassurance.
 Ravenhurr had no need for him nor his mother, and he had seen other prisoners who were not of use set free.
 Rodregas had thought that Jorin would also be set free.
 Two months went by and Rodregas had developed a strong fondness for the boy; a few of the guards made jokes that Rodregas had a new pet.

Ignore the undead once you locate him.‚Äù
 The blasphemous blanket of darkness stretched out below them like a great fog, filled with bobbing heads of Velixar‚Äôs army.
 In that chaotic mass, Dieredon knew the man in black would remain well hidden.
 Not until enough of the undead had been massacred.
 He readied his bow, his strong legs the only thing holding him to Sonowin.
 Three arrows pressed against the string of the bow, their tips dipped in holy water.
 His quiver, as was the quiver of every elf flying alongside him, contained water given to them by their clerics of Celestia.
 When their arrows bit into dead flesh, it would be like fire on a dry leaf.
 ‚ÄúLet no life lost this night be in vain!‚Äù Dieredon cried as they descended like a white river, raining arrows into the darkness.
 More than two hundred moving forms halted after that one pass, but a thousand more swayed in their sick, distracting dance.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Rodregas said.
 ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get to shelter before dark.‚Äù As he headed into the hidden hollow the orchard became clear.
 He was sure that at one point it had straight rows and a pattern to it.
 But the orchard had been wild for a very long time.
 While there was a bunch of fruit trees and berry bushes, most were the descendants of the original orchard and it was hard to find anything that reassembled a straight row.
 The apples trees were in fruit and they all started grabbing a few of each to eat as they went.
 Rodregas was not much of a farmer and did not know what the different types were named, but he liked the small green ones with the yellow splotches; they were sweet with a wonderful tang.
 ‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan, ‚ÄúHiding on a ley line definitely makes sense for keeping the Immortalists off our back and these apples are delicious.‚Äù Rodregas stared at him as he ate.
 Humans ate around the core, but Doi‚Äôvan was eating the whole apple as he talked.
 ‚ÄúAnd I love the feel of all the magic.

My headshake seemed to unnerve him a little more.
 Presumably he was having a hard time believing in a world where people didn't have fixed schedules, where moms didn't let their daughters know when they'd be back from their outings.
 "The message really is quite urgent.
 Are you positive you don't have a way to contact her?
 Well then, I suppose I've no choice."
 Most people say they don't have a choice rather flippantly, but he seemed rather more like he had his back against the wall than I expected.
 "You know, I presume, that there was some confusion regarding the tourism project she bid out for the city?
 Well, I've managed to get to the bottom of the situation and it appears we did indeed award the contract to her."

‚ÄúVICTORY!‚Äù It boomed in a chilling voice.
 The crowds of monsters roared in applause and excitement.
 The trolls banged their clubs on the ground, on their chests, and even on each other.
 The howl of a Frost Beast rose into the night, making me feel even more chilled.
 I wanted to wake up.
 But I couldn‚Äôt.
 I needed to find out what that thing was and what it had killed.
 I also had a horrible feeling, deep down that made me know that this wasn‚Äôt a dream but some type of vision.
 This was happening in real life, right now in Igneeria.
 That proved that Igneeria had worse things to hide than what we thought was bad.

I used to think, with someone who could know my secrets and also douse the fire in me and thereby keep me from all the nonsense men do on account of women, I could live content and free.
 I won‚Äôt argue the chicken and egg question, does our desire for intimacy rise out of our need for God, or is our belief in God the desperate attempt to satisfy that inborn desire for intimacy.
 But I‚Äôm placing my bets on the former, the need for God answer.
 Which is why, on this road trip, I find myself hopeful to the point of desperation that, taking a cue from Brother Lawrence, I can learn to adore God enough so that he will become my daily companion, whom I count on and trust with my failings and secrets.
 Suddenly, maybe invited by all the remembering, a whole other wave of thought takes hold of me.
 I find myself muttering a line a line from Kerouac, maybe from Dharma Bums.

In Taiwan, this was the result of a conscious strategy to utilize agriculture to stimulate job creation and domestic demand.
 The vast technological gap between the levels of agricultural productivity achieved by most developing countries and the highest yields achieved globally represents an enormous untapped potential for stimulating economic growth and job creation.
 The reduction in agricultural subsidies to farmers in industrial nations called for in the recently signed GATT trade agreements will generate far higher international demand for agricultural exports from developing countries.
 In the next chapter, we argue strongly for an agriculture-led job creation strategy and cite evidence to show how it can generate sufficient jobs to eradicate poverty in many countries.
 New deal for the self-employed
 Excluding agriculture, there are 104 million self-employed and unpaid family workers in developing countries, representing 37 per cent of the non-agricultural workforce.
 Self-employed persons and the small firms which they establish have enormous potential for rapidly generating large numbers of new jobs and raising productivity to increase incomes, provided the right policy measures are in place to support them.
 Japan‚Äôs economic growth has relied heavily on the proliferation of small rural enterprises.
 Today, 74 per cent of the Japanese workforce is employed by small and medium-sized firms.
 China created 101 million jobs between 1985 and 1991, 70 per cent in ‚Äòtownship and village enterprises‚Äô, of which nearly half are privately owned.

 Exhaustion caught up with me a few miles later and I found an old oak tree, sliding down its massive trunk to rest my aching legs.

Officer Mike ‚ÄúMooncalf‚Äù Milton, one of the arresting officers, recalls to this day how polite Buddy and the band were as they were being ushered into police cars while the mob roared.
 ‚ÄúBuddy Gardner was a gentleman in a jerk business,‚Äù Officer Milton remembers.
 This mildness, this Southern gentleman perception, follows Buddy to this day.
 It‚Äôs hard to find someone to speak ill of him, even those he later abandoned or stepped on on his way to the top.
 He is often compared to courtly though dipsomaniacal photographer Bill Eggleston, a friend of Buddy‚Äôs from those acme days.
 The cover photograph of Black Lung‚Äôs Pepper Records album, Turntable Poison, is an unaccredited Eggleston photograph.
 (It is, of course, a weathered Sinclair sign, imbued with the enchantment Mr. Eggleston brought to all his work, a divergence quite inexplicable.)
 Buddy was loved, revered.
 He was not held to the same rules as everyone else.
 So it goes with the great.

My breathing started coming faster, exceeded only by the pace of my heart.
 Apparently I wasn't the only one who could tell that working with me wasn't what the school's resident rock star had in mind.
 There was a scattered chorus of badly stifled giggles off to the front of the class.
 Not the normal kind people use when they're amused, but the high-pitched ones girls use to embarrass each other.
 Alec's face unexpectedly softened for a moment, his expression still unwelcoming, but now mixed with a trace of something else.
 While I was busy trying to understand the sudden change, Mrs. Alexander looked at the front of the class with a frown on her face for a moment.
 I suddenly realized that she knew the difference between the two kinds of giggles.
 That was unusual in someone so old.
 The younger teachers usually kept the girls from being too awful to each other, but the old guard didn't really catch the subtle differences high-school girls used to emotionally traumatize each other.
 Her kindly face taking on a stern cast, Mrs. Alexander turned back to Alec.

 The man in black gestured to the city nestled against the forest.

 ‚ÄúFollow me,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 The two rushed past the elaborate elven homes toward the sound of combat.
 They kept to the back alleys, and because of this, they met their first target: three elves fleeing toward them, hoping to use the lesser-known pathways to avoid the overwhelming numbers of their opponent.

Her voice was scratchy, and her eyes were red from crying, but she was putting on a brave face, and Rachel didn't even hesitate.
 "Of course, Jess.
 We figured you wanted some privacy with Isaac, or we would've dragged you over here hours ago."
 The rest of us were quick to pipe in, but at least on my side, the sentiment was a little half-hearted.
 Unlike Jasmin, Jessica never had come around, never made her peace with the fact that because of me things were going to go downhill in a hurry after tonight.
 I'd tried to get both Rachel and Dominic to explain why she hated me so much, but neither would give me a real explanation.
 Rachel would always just get mad and say there was no excuse for how Jess was acting.
 Dominic always refused to say anything other than that Jessica had been through her own set of struggles, and had her reasons for her behavior.
 "I'll be done with Dom in just a moment, Jess, then I'll fix your hair while Rachel finishes up with Adri."

Henry Swift and his best friend Bingo, who lands in a nursing home after a car wreck.
 He can‚Äôt speak or do much of anything except wheel his chair in widening circles.
 Whenever Henry encounters a crisis or challenge, he goes to Bingo and bares his soul but never gets an answer.

Why get something built up so much in your mind that you can't possibly ever realize it?
 All of the little things about Valentine's Day that grounded me in reality were overcome by the mystique of Prom.
 Instead of people fighting, there were dozens, sometimes even hundreds, of couples who all seemed to be very much in love.
 Everyone got to dress up and go dancing in a place that'd been transformed into another world.
 Even before I'd gotten old enough to attend Prom, I'd still invariably spent the day grouchy and depressed.
 Things only got worse as I'd aged, presumably because I wasn't really as indifferent as I liked to pretend, and I couldn't hide behind the excuse of being too young to be asked anymore.
 My pulse had already skyrocketed; I almost didn't hear what Rachel was saying over the pounding in my ears.
 "...of course it's still a little ways away, but a girl like Britney starts early so she gets as high up the social food chain as possible."
 Rachel's words calmed me a little at the same time they sparked confusion.

I thumbed through Pride and Prejudice for a few minutes, and then just gave up and headed to the bathroom.
 A short time later, teeth brushed and face washed, I swung my window wide open and climbed into bed.
 It would take hours for the air to cool down enough to start leeching some of the heat out of my room, but it was better than nothing.
 I'd at least sleep better for the second half of the night.
 As tired as I was, my mind didn't want to shut down yet.
 Mom didn't seem to think it was at all odd that the city had flip-flopped so completely on the job.
 First she had it, then she didn't, now she did again.

As I laughed, the hawk screeched, and Chevelle and Steed glanced up at the sound.

 I ran through my options‚Äîwhere was a quill pig when you needed it?‚Äîbut I wasn‚Äôt able to find anything near.

I wasn't positive he'd really come to terms with having killed Brandon.
 "They'll be fine.
 You need to worry about getting better, and nothing else."
 My pout met with just as much success as it usually did.
 After a second or two I gave up and nodded.
 "Okay, I promise to be good and concentrate on getting better, if you'll come keep me company."
 The flash of emotion, barely visible in Alec's eyes, was a source of hope and despair all at once.
 Eagerness, desire.

No, blood.
 My nose was bleeding.
 It took a moment to get my bearings.
 My bed sheets were a tangle and my clothes were disheveled.
 It must have been a dream.
 I had fallen asleep looking at my mother‚Äôs pendant, trying to remember her, and somehow combined it with the disaster I had read of the northern clans.
 It was only a dream.
 Shaken, I sat up, struggling to collect myself.
 I reached up to remove the pendant from the hook and squeezed it tight in my fist.
 It felt good, like a connection, and I slid the leather chain over my head, pulling the pendant down to rest on my chest.

 "The bank's calling the loan on our house.
 They called the Mayor's office and were told I didn't get the contract to do the tourism brochure.
 They're claiming I committed loan fraud.
 Only I don't understand, Mr. Peters told me I had the job."
 I'd pretty much forgotten about the tourism brochure for the city.
 It'd sounded like the perfect job for Mom, albeit a short term one.
 Now it was sounding like it'd been too good to be true.
 The move had been something I'd opposed and then ignored when my opposition hadn't made any difference.
 I didn't know anything about grown-up things like mortgages.

What took me by surprise was the betrayal I felt.
 All the years I‚Äôd lived in the village, I‚Äôd never counted on anyone the way I had done with this group, Chevelle especially.
 The feeling in my chest was so thick and heavy it burned.
 Struggling with my reactions kept me distracted from the ride.
 It was steep now, rocky, a haze hanging in the few spiky trees.
 When we stopped for the evening, the men quietly set up a perimeter.
 Except for Chevelle.
 He was watching me as I glared back at him.
 Why had I expected more from him?

And I‚Äôm way back with Eric on the sea cliffs just outside the cemetery, and even father back, riding beside my dad over the mountains in the old Chevy bobtail.
 Then I remember a strange idea from the philosopher Blaise Pascal, a line from his book Penses, which contends not only is Jesus alive, he continues to be crucified for our sins.
 So, maybe Christ didn‚Äôt only die for us way back in time, but he's still dying for us.

We were alone in the middle of nowhere and I was sitting in his lap.
 My flush deepened and I hastily stood to straighten my clothes.
 He watched me fidget.
 ‚ÄúUm, so I guess we should get going?‚Äù I stammered.
 ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù My breath caught and I forced myself to look at him, still edgy from the closeness the moment before.
 I convinced myself I was imagining the way he studied me as he sat against the downed tree.
 He had no idea what I was thinking.
 It was the furthest thing from his mind.

Harruq whirled on him, a quick double strike knocking the sword from his hand.
 Helpless, the man staggered backward, clutching his wounded side.
 His eyes pleaded, but his mouth would dare not say the demeaning words.
 Harruq cut him again and again.
 His arms, his chest, his face: it all bled.
 But he remained alive, at least until that final moment when the two magic blades scissor-cut his neck.
 Harruq sheathed his swords and held the decapitated head of his foe high above him.
 Full of pride, Qurrah watched his brother roar his victory to the night sky.

Alec nodded, a short choppy motion that eloquently conveyed his desire not to discuss the matter.
 He turned towards me, only to break off as a cell phone rang.
 "It's for you, probably your mom.
 Pretend you're home, I'll explain once you're finished."
 I almost dropped the phone, and probably wouldn't have managed to figure out how to answer the call in time if he hadn't reached over and pushed the green button for me.
 "Hello?"
 "Adri, honey, are you sure this is a good idea?
 I haven't gotten on the charter plane yet, there's still time to call this off if you're uneasy about being alone for so long."

‚ÄúWe might lose some guards and probably some of the kitchen drudges if they have money in hand and a whole week off, also we leave ourselves open for theft if we don‚Äôt keep at least a minimum of guards at the front gate.‚Äù Rodregas relaxed at the mundane nature of the questions.
 ‚ÄúTrue, but I will not stint in thanking the gods for a favorable ceremony.
 Keep a few guards at the gate, but only the minimum needed.
 But that does remind me.
 Release any remaining prisoners and make sure they are fed and clothed, and allow them to make their way back to their homes.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat has some danger to it,‚Äù said Captain Poir hurriedly, his expression returning to a look of concern.
 ‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù he replied.
 ‚ÄúBut do as I command,‚Äù Rodregas stated in his firmest voice.
 Captain Poir nodded and immediately said, ‚ÄúAs you command, master.‚Äù Rodregas started to open the door to the stairway when another thought hit him, and he turned back to the captain, and said, ‚ÄúI need time to adjust.
 Make sure that I am not disturbed in my quarters tonight, but tell Adapt Korin that before he leaves to celebrate, to come up to my room for some last minute instructions.‚Äù Captain Poir responded with his very military, ‚ÄúYes sir.‚Äù  Rodregas had to admit while most of the guards were no better trained than a ruffian off the street the captain had served with The Immortal Guards and he was highly trained and disciplined.

His spell took in this life energy through his hand, filling his body with it, healing his wounds and clearing his mind.
 The darkness fighting for control in his head subsided, a shred of strength returning to his limbs.
 There was still the slight problem of the arrow lodged in his throat.
 Qurrah had a solution but it was far from pleasant.
 Most likely he would die, but he had to try.
 He heard no screams coming from around the corner, but he knew that meant nothing.
 He had to believe his brother was still alive.
 He had to help him.
 Qurrah took out his last healing potion, popped the cork, and then held it before him.
 Blood was beginning to fill his throat once more.

The alley opened up to the main street, running south from the center of town into the forest beyond.
 It was there that the bulk of combat had spread.
 Elves battled in the street, horribly outnumbered.
 They were skilled, though, and a steady stream of arrows from homes continued to weaken the human forces.
 ‚ÄúHalt here,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 To their right was a two-story elven home.
 Three bowmen fired from the windows at a party of fifteen soldiers.
 The men of Neldar had their shields raised high, but the synergy between the elves in the home and the elves on the street was superb.
 The Tun brothers watched the sword wielders on the ground dance in, make a few precise swings to change the positioning of the shields, and then dart away.

 It was almost worth all of the craziness and exhaustion of the last seventy-two hours to see her eyebrows rise in astonishment as she read the innocuous piece of paper essentially giving Alec carte blanche in her classroom.
 "This is highly irregular, Mr. Graves.
 In fact I don't believe the administration can legitimately expect me to comply."
 Alec's smile could have been used to sweeten pretty much any beverage you could imagine.
 "I promise not to get in the way.
 In fact if you could just find us a couple of desks in the back corner you'll hardly know we're here."
 The look she shot me was so venomous for a second I thought my heart was going to stop.

 After forcing himself to wait until the last visible person left the main gate, Rodregas grabbed the trunk and went to the stairs.
 He listened quietly, and hearing nothing, he set the trunk down and quietly walked down the stairs.
 The next floor housed the laboratory.
 The door was locked and he did not want to break it down until he was sure everyone had left.
 The next floor down was the main floor; He stepped out to the main hall and listened.
 He heard nothing but his stomach rumble; he was very hungry and knew that he should eat.
 He was already in the main hall; the room to the right was the kitchen.

 The rest of the night, the two lovers spent quietly connected and at peace, but they shared few words.
 In the morning after meditation, Doi‚Äôvan pulled forth two wooden staves that he had cut and said with a smile and an exaggerated wink, ‚ÄúApparently you are healed up from your wound now, so I think it is time to stop with these making of shadows like children and time for some more physical training.‚Äù As he finished speaking he tossed Rodregas one of the staves.
 ‚ÄúWith my people we teach our children to fight using the staff.
 It is hard to kill someone by accident with a staff, but you can still deliver pain.
 The avoidance of pain is a great way to teach someone to be nimble and quick.
 My war masters at the palace would say you two are too old to learn the staff, but it is the way that I know.‚Äù ‚ÄúSir Paladin,‚Äù he said to Rodregas, imposing the unearned honor title.

 He was being pulled physically into the panther.
 He started to pull away, but then he stopped and let himself sink into the shape of the great beast.
 Panic set in as his mouth started to sink into the creature‚Äôs head.

 That summer before our senior year, Margaret's best friend was Pam Greenman, who attended our rival high school.
 Lane was someone I probably never would've befriended if not for Eric.
 Since we met in seventh grade, I had considered Lane a smart-mouthed little pest while he thought of me as a big, dumb oaf.
 In Eric's company, we each learned better.
 I have Eric's treasures, which Sylvia gave me.
 Along with them came a treasure of hers, a letter from Pam Greenman.
 She wrote, "One can't begin to talk about Eric because there is no beginning, just as there is no end.

 I would need Brandon to assist me with current drug terms.
 What did an Oxy look like?
 What milligram size I should say I have?
 Brandon told me that the easiest way to buy pills is from people who are prescribed them for chronic pain and intentionally demand more than they need from their doctors so they can resell them at an enormous profit.
 Brandon told me that the Holy Grail for an Oxy dealer was to find an ‚Äúold guy with a script‚Äù (prescription); so I decided this would be who I would become.
 I went to a Wal-Mart and purchased a pre-paid cellular phone that I would use as my undercover phone.
 I didn‚Äôt need my last name popping up on a caller I.D.
 I nicknamed the phone my ‚Äúcrack-berry.‚Äù After getting crucial information and doing a bit of research, I found the Craigslist classified advertisement with a picture of a young blond girl offering massages with a contact phone number that matched the drug dealer Steve‚Äôs number.

Now I felt bad that I had nagged him so hard that he was breaking.
 I walked over to him and wrapped my arms around his body.
 He stopped crying and I felt him squirm.
 Seth grunted and then mumbled, ‚ÄúGet off me.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, not until you tell me what‚Äôs going on,‚Äù I said.
 He groaned.
 ‚ÄúSeriously Jazell, nothing is wrong.
 Now get off me.‚Äù I rolled my eyes but he couldn‚Äôt see that.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a horrible liar Seth.‚Äù ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I felt him sigh.

Jim ‚Äì What do you mean spying?
 You repeat it over and over while sitting and watching television in the living room.
 Johnny ‚Äì Why are you bothering, it‚Äôs my business.
 Jim ‚Äì It‚Äôs all of our business.

His face was masked with one emotion, one that made me vow to myself that I would find out what he was hiding, what he was keeping a secret.
 That emotion was not Seth, not the one I knew.
 It made me feel the same way and I didn‚Äôt know why.
 Fear.
 Chapter 5
 The water war continued with us getting them and them getting us.
 We attacked them with a pool, and they threw water balloons at us while we were on bikes.
 It was pretty simple, but the whole time all I noticed was Seth.
 He wasn‚Äôt the same to me anymore; he always had this mask on his face, hiding himself from the rest of us.
 I had to find out what was wrong, and soon.

Or rather, would come back to 2011.
 He tightened his arms around her.

 He laughed, setting her back to look at her.

I skimmed through Alec's answer and felt my anger joined by surprise and just the slightest touch of admiration.
 He struck on exactly the same theory as I had, and done at least as good of job explaining it.
 Maybe even better considering that he took the time to review some of the underlying theory we'd been taught in class.
 I'd just jumped right into the answer.
 "You're right.
 You never even came to class, and you got the right answer.
 Did you cheat?
 Is the answer to this problem out there somewhere on the Internet?"
 Alec's face tightened with something I was willing to bet was anger.

It would take hours for the air to cool down enough to start leeching some of the heat out of my room, but it was better than nothing.
 I'd at least sleep better for the second half of the night.
 As tired as I was, my mind didn't want to shut down yet.
 Mom didn't seem to think it was at all odd that the city had flip-flopped so completely on the job.
 First she had it, then she didn't, now she did again.
 None of it made sense, but she seemed perfectly ready to accept everything at face value.
 Maybe her way was the best.
 I certainly envied her.
 Not the not knowing, but the fact that she didn't have to worry about what it all meant.
 How did I get stuck being the parent, while she got to be the kid?

At the same time he moved his body to the side and in close.
 Rodregas then dropped his right sword as he kept his left engaged, pushing the blue steel sword away.
 Rodregas moved in and thrust out with his open hand with a speed the guard simply could not match nor have expected.
 Rodregas had the guard‚Äôs throat in his grasp before his opponent knew what was happening.
 The guard was not a big man and with his celestial strength Rodregas simply picked him up and squeezed.
 Rodregas felt the guard‚Äôs neck give under his grip.
 Before the slavers could react, Rodregas went from lifting him up to driving him down into the ground.
 Adrenaline was surging and suddenly Rodregas had a bloody mess in his hand.
 The guard was very dead.
 Rodregas let go of the broken neck and stood quickly, trying to clear himself of the gore.

We never knew when we were going to get knocked across the room.
 We were often treated like unwanted animals.
 We wondered why this was happening to us but at the same time we wondered if the same thing was happening in the families across the street.
 Our half-brother, Harry (named after Dino‚Äôs father) was soon born.
 Then, my stepfather had even less regard for us as we were now second-class citizens to his ‚Äúreal‚Äù son.
 My mother was also abused.
 She stayed, as so many abused women do, because her only options would only lead us back to poverty and uncertainty, and also because Dino threatened to take my little brother to Greece where she would never see him again.
 She protected us and herself as best as she could and she likely hoped for better days.
 Back then we didn‚Äôt have options as kids either.
 There were no toll free hotline numbers to call to safely report abuse and we knew better than to tell anyone what was happening behind closed doors.

By her expression she'd decided on being mad.
 "Do you realize what you just did?"
 I was still fresh out of witty comments.
 I just shrugged instead.
 Britney had been mad before, now she looked furious.
 "You just picked sides, and you picked the wrong one."
 Maybe I still wasn't recovered from my ordeal on Friday; I felt like I was missing something obvious.
 Britney apparently agreed, and she wasted no time in letting me know what it was.
 "There are two in-crowds here; Brandon's group, which consists of all of the athletes and cheerleaders, and Alec's group, which is about half the size, and outside of his immediate friends is made up of a few geeks and misfits.

I loosened the wet corset ties and dropped the dress into a pile at my feet, shivering as I stepped free of it and onto a rock.
 I grabbed a shirt from the pile, and then the slim pants, aware of how nice the fabric felt, how good the cut.
 A leather vest laced over the top.
 It seemed they were tailored for me.
 I‚Äôd never had such luck making my own clothes.
 These were trim and fit, made for traveling.
 Not that I knew where I was going.
 My desire to trail Chevelle had been smashed, but there was no way I could return to the village.

My other grandma.
 And three high school friends including my best friend Eric.
 After Eric died, I took a vow.
 I would love nobody.
 Then neither death nor desertion could hurt me.
 The attitude worked, except it doomed my marriage and helped make me crazy.
 When Darcy arrived, the sight of her instantly flushed my heart of that vow against loving.
 I would sooner have risked any torment than given up my bond with that perfect little girl.
 I became a different fellow.

The elf looked at him.
 She was trying to read him, Harruq could tell, but he endured it without protest.
 ‚ÄúWhen Ashhur and Karak warred, there were elves that sought to end it,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúAgainst Celestia‚Äôs orders, they joined Karak, hoping their aid would finally end the conflict.
 When our goddess imprisoned the two gods, she cursed those elves.
 She stripped them of their beauty, their intelligence, and their long life.
 They weren‚Äôt evil, Harruq, but Karak offered them strength and they accepted it.
 The dark god drove them to war against elves and men.
 Finally the orcs were banished to the Vile Wedge between the rivers.‚Äù

He seemed to be afraid to come over even when the body started to shake in pain.
 After they stepped away from the female squire the healer came over to the other side of the bed from Rodregas and Doi‚Äôvan and touched the woman‚Äôs neck.
 He looked reassured at her vital signs and said, ‚ÄúWhat did you do?‚Äù He looked nervous, though Rodregas was not sure why.
 Imeralda spoke up, ‚ÄúI hope you are not offended, but I am part Nymph and our healing powers work differently than yours.
 She should heal faster for the next few days.‚Äù Rodregas hid his smile; it was a good cover story.
 ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù said the healer.
 ‚ÄúDo you have the strength to heal a few others?
 I think we will lose several more otherwise.‚Äù Rodregas could not tell if the healer believed Imeralda‚Äôs story or recognized what was going on and was going along with it to save his patients.
 ‚ÄúI would be happy to help them, but I have to do it as privately as possible,‚Äù said Imeralda.
 The healer did not seem to take the odd request as being unusual and simply stepped away after leading them to two more patients.

, ‚ÄúWe can talk with the patients and their families,‚Äù said the healer. He then led them to the female squire again, and said, ‚ÄúIf we must see the92m Ny0m92m woman0m, we may speak with her92m if0m she can help us.

I mean I love to travel with you, but while Doi‚Äôvan and I are warriors, when you joined us it was only as a travel companion.
 If you want to stay with the village or stay with Jordaan I will understand.
 You know that by now they will be hunting us, if not because of Ravenhurr‚Äôs death, than because of the missing Immortal Guards.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou know that I probably killed more slavers with the Black Yew bow than either you or Doi‚Äôvan right?‚Äù asked Imeralda with a snort.
 ‚ÄúYour abilities are not of question,‚Äù Rodregas responded.
 ‚ÄúYour abilities as a Forest Nymph and as an archer make you a very deadly woman.
 As you gain control over your magical powers you will only become more dangerous.
 The question is whether you want to fight?‚Äù Imeralda nodded and she hesitated.
 ‚ÄúI will be honest,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúI am a little torn, I have never been as afraid as during and after the battle.
 I have truly come to care for both of you.

If he‚Äôd been under the false impression he‚Äôd had to take me, I wasn‚Äôt about to mess that up only to be dragged back to the village.
 Especially after everything that had happened.
 My horse quickened his pace to ride alongside his and I made a mental note to learn how to control the horse on my own.
 The constricted path forced us close together, our stirrups and legs brushing as we rode.
 Chevelle nodded at my hand and I held it out, palm up.
 Chevelle indicated a spot on one of the mountains.
 ‚ÄúWe are here.‚Äù I tried not to let my disappointment show.
 The information would‚Äôve only helped if I‚Äôd known where I started on the map or its endpoint.
 But at least I knew we were closer.
 When we came through the pass our path widened, but the horses didn‚Äôt separate as I had expected them to.

"I'm Brandon."
 Feeling more than a little nervous, I allowed him to capture my right hand in his.
 "I'm Adr...Adriana."
 Our handshake had ended, but my hand was tingling slightly.
 It was a pleasant, if illusionary, reminder of the contact, one I was hoping would last for about the next three days.
 "You must be the poor soul who's got everyone buzzing with curiosity."
 Brandon reached into the tall, glass-fronted fridge next to the cashier while he was talking, and pulled out a bottle of water and one of those aggressively-colored energy drinks.
 He slipped some money to the cashier while I was still trying to come up with a response that didn't sound stupid.

When we rely on external resources, we achieve the minimum because our achievement is based on what we see before us.
 When we rely on the inner resources, we achieve the maximum because we are constantly led to discover more of our own unlimited capacities.
 Why should we wait before acting until we are compelled by the irresistible force of the rising expectations of the world‚Äôs masses, by the explosion of violence in our cities, or by the complete breakdown of our economic systems because of spiralling unemployment?
 Why should we not act now to prevent these outcomes and reverse the trends that threaten to make them a reality?
 All the resources necessary are within our reach, within ourselves.
 We need the courage to think and say that it is time to abolish weapons of mass destruction and call a halt to the use of war for settlement of disputes, that it is time to insist that all people enjoy the most basic democratic freedoms, that there can and must be enough food produced to feed everyone, and that every person must be guaranteed the right to gainful employment.
 The barriers to these achievements are not material or technological.
 It takes money, materials and technology to make war, not to stop it.
 That requires a determination and insistence, an intolerance of violence, which must start with a commitment of the world‚Äôs leaders and the total empowerment of the UN to enforce peace.

The elders were frantic, which only frightened me more.
 I had never seen them agitated.
 This carried on for hours.
 My hair and clothing were drenched in sweat and I was near surrender.
 And then, with no more warning than when the first pains came, it was over.
 A small, sweet child was in my arms.
 I drew in ragged breaths as I cleaned her face.

The next day Brandon returned to the Narconon facility to start his three months of internship.
 He would learn how to apply the lessons he learned and many more skills he was yet to be taught.
 The months went by slowly for him as he worked for no income as interns do.
 They fed him and they housed him and they educated him.
 He had his ups and downs but he embraced his goal to help others who were afflicted by addiction as he was.
 He started in detox, which was fitting, as it is exactly where he began.
 It was a dirty job that we knew all too well.
 He described how he rubbed the backs of the young men who vomited and comforted them as they reeled in pain from withdrawals.

The sun moved along its path in the sky, and the brothers finally awoke.
 Qurrah vanished, returning later with meager portions of bread and tough meat.
 Aurelia watched, oddly amused by their silent noshing.
 Harruq continuously glanced over at Qurrah, and when the frailer half-orc was overtaken by a coughing fit, Harruq was there, pounding his brother‚Äôs back and looking like his world was about to end.
 Qurrah merely looked embarrassed and pushed him away.
 _They clearly love each other,_ thought Aurelia.
 _Maybe Harruq more than Qurrah._
 The day passed, and it was thankfully uneventful.

 He confessed to spending years trying to find me.
 He‚Äôd thought I was angry with him and that was why I‚Äôd not returned.
 He was afraid to leave this spot in case I were to change my mind, forgive him for whatever he‚Äôd done.

In many developing countries the military can assist with efforts to improve social services in rural areas on a war footing ‚Äì to spread literacy, primary education, basic vocational skills, health care and access to safe drinking water.
 The military have at their disposal scientific and technological resources which in many cases can be applied to environmental protection with the minimum of adaptation, such as information and monitoring systems that track changes in the atmosphere, in the oceans and on earth‚Äôs surface.
 These resources can be applied to environmental monitoring and impact assessment, protection of endangered species, quick response to disasters and accidents, energy conservation, and the minimization and management of waste.
 The appropriate role for the military in these various activities will depend on the country, the urgency of the circumstances, and the cost-effectiveness of military involvement compared with available alternatives.
 In some instances, it may be feasible to establish international ‚ÄòEarth corps units‚Äô, specially trained and equipped to carry out certain types of environmental protection and restoration, such as India‚Äôs eco-battalions, which seek to conserve the Himalayan habitat by restoring tree cover and constructing small dams and canals.

 The goals of peace, prosperity and fulfilment for every human being represent formidable challenges ‚Äì intellectual, attitudinal, organizational and technological.
 We cannot hope to reach such lofty achievements if we waste and squander the precious and abundant resources ‚Äì mental, psychological, social and material ‚Äì placed at our disposal.
 A massive reduction in emphasis on weapons production and military establishments, made possible by recent political events and demanded by the pressing unmet needs of people everywhere, represents both a great opportunity and a considerable challenge.
 The opportunity is not only further to reduce the threat of war by reducing the capacity for waging war, but also to redirect and utilize for other purposes the resources now dedicated to war making and prevention.

"You sound disappointed.
 Do you want me to leave?"
 His expression had taken on the guarded blankness I still hadn't learned how to read, so I wasn't sure whether he was joking or not.
 "No, not disappointed, just surprised.
 I figured I'd wake up and find everything had just been one amazing, crazy dream."
 I'd hoped that my reassurance would make the mask drop, but if anything Alec was looking at me even more seriously.
 "Would you prefer things to take that course?"
 It took me several heartbeats to understand what he was getting at, long seconds in which his face grew increasingly remote.

 Love?
 The heart of the Shema, Deuteronomy 6:5, commands Israel to: ‚ÄúLove the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.‚Äù Jesus agrees, in Matthew 22: "‚ÄôTeacher,‚Äô a disciple asks,  ‚Äòwhich is the greatest commandment in the Law?‚Äô Jesus replies: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.
 This is the first and greatest commandment.‚Äô‚Äù The word "love" has dozens of meanings, and the one that rings truest to me involves action and will rather than feeling.
 In M. Scott Peck‚Äôs definition, "Love is the willingness to sacrifice for the sake of someone else's spiritual growth."
 Since God hardly needs spiritual growth, let‚Äôs define loving God as the willingness to sacrifice when God calls us to.
 And at the very least, he calls us to obey his commandments.
 Meaning we face yet another problem.

Not compared to the first thing I'd faced in hours that had the potential to hurt me.
 I could feel the edge, razor sharp, cleanly parting some of the layers of gauze that'd been wrapped around my emotions.
 It didn't make sense.
 Alec was barely even civil.
 He most definitely wasn't part of the support structure that'd been holding my world in its normal orbit, but suddenly my defenses were in danger of being breached.
 He looked up disinterestedly as I sat in my desk, and even that was enough to send little shivers of near pain coursing through my system.
 It wasn't real pain; I was still too cushioned from the world for that, but my body shied away from it just the same.
 I wanted to run screaming from the room, to jump through a window, to do anything to avoid coming into further contact with someone who so obviously hated me.
 The urges were all very real, but it was like I'd been drugged to the gills.
 I couldn't gather the energy to do anything about them.

 Rachel's soft blue eyes got really wide as she recoiled slightly.
 Whatever she was about to say was preempted as we were both thrown forward in our seats.
 James slid the car through a one-eighty turn that left us facing the direction we'd just come from, only a couple of feet from the start of our lane.

He'd hate to waste a whole Sunday fighting.
 He took his tea out to the garden.
 Gazing at the white roses, he sighed, wishing Marie would come down and share the beauty of the morning with him.
 He couldn't blame her for being mad, but he was getting desperate.
 He felt as if he were in a race to convince her to marry him before they reached a point where they were unable to stop themselves from making love.
 He couldn't keep pushing her away forever.
 It was a wonder he'd been able to stop himself--and her--this long.
 Being here was like being on vacation, she'd told him.
 He sipped his tea, trying to imagine what this was all really like for her.
 He remembered his first trip to Europe, the summer after he‚Äôd graduated from college.

Transition is the process by which society moves from one form or level of activities to another.
 While social scientists conveniently divide social activity into several categories ‚Äì political, economic, social, educational, religious, cultural ‚Äì in practice these distinctions are at best only partially true.
 Economic activities in any society take place on the foundation of the political system, social values and customs, and the psychological aspirations and attitudes of the people.
 During normal periods of slow and gradual change, the impact or role of other dimensions operates below the surface and appears minimal.
 Economists studying the results of economic variables tend to overlook the influence of factors from other fields on the assumption that non-economic factors are constant.
 Under relatively stable and static conditions, these economics principles can be employed to predict changes in economic variables to a considerable extent.
 But under circumstances in which underlying economic, social and political conditions are undergoing radical change, the relevance and predictive capacity of purely economic concepts is quite limited.
 This was the situation confronting the states of the region at the beginning of the transition period, and the reason why the actual results of the reform differed so drastically from what had been anticipated.
 The situation in Eastern and Central Europe was further complicated by the disproportionately large size and importance of the defence sector in the economy.
 This necessitates, not only a change from one economic system to another, but also a restructuring of the entire economy from a defence orientation to a consumer orientation.

mere transformation in the role of the defence sector in the economy but, rather, a change of the structure of economic, political, social and cultural regimes. This will is directly related to the size92m and0m role of the defence sector in the framework of the wider economy. Besides the shift in the political orientation of92m the0m defence sector from a defence92m orientation0m to consumer orientation, all of this is being important in the context of fundamental changes in the social and political system92m of0m the country S92m.0m<eop><eod>

The muscles of his neck and shoulders were bunched up and she could feel his anger through her bond with him.
 But he was also breathing deeply and through the bond she knew he was trying to control himself.
 Imeralda saw that Rodregas was also watching Doi‚Äôvan.
 She thought he also recognized the danger of a Hellborn rage.
 Imeralda reached out to Rodregas first to try to get him to calm down and help manage Doi‚Äôvan.
 Imeralda focused on their bond and looked him in the eyes and said, ‚ÄúRodregas getting angry will not change things, let‚Äôs sit down and talk to the village elders.
 They are thankful for what we have done.
 They need payment for their risk, but they understand we have needs.‚Äù Rodregas nodded and seemed to be calming down until Jordaan spoke, ‚ÄúNo, you made your agreement.
 Imeralda you have said that the equipment of the Immortal Guard was ours.
 While our warriors are not as renown as some of the other races, we have several who are worthy of such armor and such gear is critical for our own survival.‚Äù Imeralda could see both men‚Äôs renewed rage at Jordaan‚Äôs words.

I believed they needed to learn good strong work ethics.
 But I never once hit them, and I never abused them, as I had learned ‚Äúwhat not to do‚Äù as a father.
 I did everything I could think of to give them the best chance to succeed in life.
 I protected them from what I felt were bad influences, including, sadly, my brother, their Uncle Thomas, who had not been reformed in prison.
 He was an addict into horse racing.
 When my boys were in grammar school, our neighbor asked me who the man was who came to our home during the day while we were at work.
 He said that this guy, sometimes with another man, would enter our house through the garage with the keypad code.
 We knew nothing of this!
 The neighbor described the car, and the description matched Thomas‚Äôs car.
 I showed him a family photo and he identified Thomas as the guy.

Finally Van‚Äôdret said, ‚ÄúI cannot say what was in the minds of others.‚Äù Van‚Äôdret started to raise his hand and Rodregas spoke quickly trying to keep him engaged, ‚ÄúSo, are you saying there are not Immortalists led by Taiga who are breaking ‚ÄòThe One Law‚Äô set by both the Gods in the Celestial Realm and the Daemon Lordsin the Infernal to keep balance?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret went pale at Rodregas words and then he stood up very tall.
 For the first time true anger was in his words, ‚ÄúYou do not know what you are getting in the middle of.
 You are barely more than a squire and yet you would get in a battle of beings so much greater than you?‚Äù The Immortalist went from anger to laughter, but his laughter did not last long.
 His laughter was like all things Immortalist, beautiful but cold.
 When it ended he said simply, ‚ÄúTime for the three of you to die.‚Äù What Rodregas did next he knew was meaningless, but he hoped it would give Imeralda a last chance to act.
 He reached inside where he used to find his ‚Äòitch,‚Äô except his former little magical power was now a raging volcano.
 He had learned from Imeralda a new spell to make light; he waved his hands,  mumbled the incantation, and then threw all his power, and sent it straight at Van‚Äôdret in a stream of energy that felt like a river of lava flowing from his hands.
 In fact there was not so much as a flicker of light.
 Rodregas lacked the discipline to channel the power.
 Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs senses were acute on things arcane and he felt the coming flood of power as if it was a real physical thing.

 I leaned forward, resting my head on my knees.

He did not think the knife had cut into anything too important; at least it was not bleeding too badly.
 He was surprised that he was not more tired; maybe his new body handled such things better and could make do with less sleep.
 He was usually a light sleeper and was very surprised that they had been able to get the drop on him.
 His guess was that the AElf maiden had cast some sort of spell on him to mask their approach, and he kept a close eye on her to make sure she did not repeat the effort.
 Of course she was also very nice to look at, so he did not need much of an excuse to enjoy the view.
 In the morning, he slowly pulled out some of the supplies and bundled them.
 He tried not to show how much he hurt.
 The wound might not kill him, but every movement hurt.

But I was staring.
 Despite my resolve, color rose to my cheeks once more as I turned away.
 I couldn‚Äôt understand why he was affecting me this way.
 The pages stuffed in my shirt felt like fire against my skin.
 I quickened my pace, caught my toe on a root, and stumbled.
 As soon as I righted myself, I wasn‚Äôt able to stop myself from peeking back to see if he had noticed, but he was gone.
 I didn‚Äôt know if I was relieved.
 My mind went over the encounter again as I made my way home.
 Did he always wear such a stern expression?
 Why was he looking at me so intensely?

Although the Green Revolution has been widely heralded as an achievement of modern technology, the hybrid seeds and chemical-based cultivation practices that formed the technological basis for the breakthrough in foodgrain production constitute only one part of a comprehensive, integrated development strategy in which government played a central and crucial role.
 This strategy included massive, country-wide demonstration programmes to introduce farmers to new technology, the establishment of new public sector agencies for rapid multiplication and distribution of seeds, assured markets and guaranteed floor prices for foodgrains to eliminate fear that higher production would result in crashing prices, construction of additional storage capacity to house the increased production, import or manufacture of fertilizers, and, most importantly, for transport, distribution and marketing of surplus grains in food deficit areas.
 Few developing countries ‚Äì perhaps few countries at any stage of development ‚Äì could have marshalled resources on such a massive scale and instituted such widespread changes so rapidly without heavy reliance on the government for both planning and execution.
 In the majority of developing countries, government is still the most organized and efficient agency and the only one capable of such significant initiative.
 In formulating strategies, it is essential to take fully into account both the stages and steps of the development process.
 At this stage in their development, it is highly unlikely that food-deficit African nations can make rapid progress toward food self-sufficiency without strong government support and investment to improve technology, training, techno-infrastructure and trade.
 Once the rural sector begins to exhibit its own dynamism, as in the majority of developing countries, there is strong justification for a shift in the role of government from that of prime mover, planner and controller of development to that of catalyst and pioneer.
 Government agencies can tap the potentials of agriculture, identifying new commercial opportunities, educating farmers, demonstrating new potentials, assisting in the transfer and dissemination of new technology, and promoting the establishment of effective organizations ‚Äì preferably privately or co-operatively owned by farmers or at least with their participation ‚Äì to process, distribute and market what is produced.
 Coping with the environmental problems to preserve the ecological foundations essential for sustainable agriculture is an area in which government has special responsibilities and must play a leading role on an ongoing basis.
 Regulating the diversion of prime farm land for non-farm uses, expansion of irrigation capacity, control of groundwater exploitation, major programmes for reforestation and to prevent or reverse desertification, and regulation of pesticide use can only be effectively planned, monitored and regulated by governments.

Humanity has lived with war for so many millennia that it is difficult to imagine a world without it.
 Even in the four decades of ‚Äòpeace‚Äô following the Second World War, approximately 160 inter-state and intra-state wars, including 100 major conflicts, have been fought in developing countries, leading directly to 20 million deaths ‚Äì half of them caused by the armed forces of developed countries in Korea, Indochina, Algeria and other anti-colonial wars ‚Äì and to another 20 million war-related casualties.
 These massive casualties during a time of ‚Äòpeace‚Äô are roughly equal to the total casualties incurred by all the countries of the world during the last world war.
 An equally disturbing phenomenon has been the expansion of violence within society for political purposes.
 Of the 82 armed conflicts between 1989 and 1992, only three were between states.
 During 1993, 42 countries were involved in 52 major conflicts, and another 37 experienced political violence.
 Terrorist warfare, whose principal aim is to threaten social peace, has become the model for conflicts in Northern Ireland, the Middle East and the drug war in Colombia.
 Modern means of communication, increased vulnerabilities of inter-dependent, integrated civil societies, and modern instruments of violence make these forms of war extremely destructive.
 The expansion of war to encompass society poses one of the most serious challenges to national and international security and development and raises fundamental questions regarding war as an instrument of policy.
 For more than two centuries, war has been rationalized as an appropriate instrument in international affairs.

‚ÄúThere, you must get to them!‚Äù
 The horse snorted, banked around, and dove straight for the approaching hands.
 A quick spiral avoided the first wave.
 Dieredon clutched his bow and held on for dear life, his eyes locking on the man in black who stood perfectly still, his arms at downward angles from his body.
 The rest of the elves were in full retreat.
 He was the only one left.
 Qurrah watched Dieredon‚Äôs approach with a gnawing fear in his chest.
 It seemed no hand could touch this one, the horse possessing dexterity beyond what any creature that size should have.
 Velixar showed no sign of being aware of their approach.

The truth was that she felt incapable of simply picking up where she'd left off.
 She loved being with her family again, and she was having a wonderful time with her mother, but it felt as if something were missing.
 And she knew Rick was that something.
 As glad as she was to be home, she felt incomplete without him.
 It was as if her whole morning had been a series of peaks and valleys.
 She and her mother would exclaim over a dress that was perfect for her, and then she'd realize that she wouldn't be able to wear it for Rick.
 She'd see an elegant necktie that would be perfect for Rick and then realize she could never give it to him.

 My father‚Äôs indiscretion was no secret.
 The entire kingdom knew of his notorious action, stealing a light elf for his bride, though the stories vary.
 Some insist he was overtaken by love and she came willingly.
 Others that he raided her village and took her in the night.

Thomas had also conned or borrowed thousands of dollars from mutual friends and associates, and it was not uncommon for my wife and me to be confronted by angry people in restaurants or public places because my brother owed them money.
 The last straw with Thomas was over Christmas many years back when he became so violent and threatening that Lisa and I decided to not see him or his family again.
 We even told our children that if Uncle Thomas came to our house or ever tried to get them in a car that they were to run to any other adult.
 We did not know what drug he was on or how far he would go.
 When he moved to southern California, we were not faced with Thomas‚Äôs problems anymore.
 I crossed him off of my list‚Äîthe brother who had stood shoulder to shoulder with me through all the moves, the abuse, and so much else.
 The brother who for a while was all I had was completely estranged from me.
 I had put Thomas in a similar category as my biological Father, Richard.
 I considered that in both of their cases, nothing good seemed to happen when I associated with them so I just kept them out of my life and my family‚Äôs as well.
 The latest stories I had heard about Thomas were that while at one point he had escalated his abuse to injecting heroin, he then attended a drug rehab center called Narconon, which had apparently enabled him to be clean for the last couple of years.

8.Technology transfer: Accelerate transfer of technology to and between developing countries.
 One or more profit-making commercial organizations should be established as a public sector joint venture of developing countries to promote the commercial transfer of technology to, within and between developing countries and to channel the profits from this activity toward research in these countries.
 9.Global employment model: Our efforts to promote employment are constrained by a lack of detailed knowledge of how global labour markets actually work.
 We still do not understand the impact of technology, trade, macro-economic policies, multinational corporations, shifting patterns of foreign investment and many other factors on job creation, and our ignorance severely hampers effective policy formulation and coordination.
 An international research programme should be organized under the ILO to construct a truly global employment model that monitors the impact of technological developments, expanding world trade, plant closings, movement of industry to low-wage countries, agriculture-led industrialization, economic growth, immigration policies, refugee movements and other factors affecting employment opportunities around the world.
 10.Shift focus of technological development: The number of jobs created or destroyed by technology depends on the priority given to various objectives in the process of technological development.
 Presently, there is an in-built bias in technological R & D towards replacing human labour with capital and energy, even when similar levels of quality and efficiency could be achieved by alternative means.
 A conscious shift of focus could lead to the development of more labour-intensive production processes.
 The production of more food to meet the needs of a burgeoning population has been one of the outstanding global achievements of the post-war period.
 It has demonstrated the extraordinary capacity of humankind to meet a collective challenge of monumental proportions.

owing use of technology and its impact on human health and the environment, making production of food affordable will92m enhance0m the capacity of society and industry to improve quality and efficiency and meet the needs and demands of a growing population population at the same time. 11.Increasing job opportunity: As developing countries continue to increase the number of jobs created by technology, the use of technology will increase92m and0m the employment92m opportunities0m for people92m will0m expand also. The use of technology and information in labour markets is bound92m to0m expand the employment opportunities

 It was late by the time I reached the tree and I was tired enough I didn‚Äôt care as much about being caught.
 I didn‚Äôt even know if they knew who broke the seal, if they knew I was the guilty party.
 But I was still quiet as I entered the house, then my room, and slid into bed.
 The next morning I slipped out early to call on Junnie.

Her folks were out of town.
 Maybe the proposition and setup spooked me.
 Anyway, for reasons lost to time, I went to the dance alone, and afterward took Serena Furby for a ride.
 I hadn‚Äôt known that Serena and Liz sat next to each other in summer school.
 Liz called me various names and tried to get our friend Les Falos to thrash me.
 He considered the proposition, then laughed it off.
 A couple weeks passed before Bill Torrey came and asked if I would mind him taking Liz out.
 No problem, I said.
 In my heart, Billy Torrey was my little brother, and would be for years to come.
 We would play music and perform together in a coffee house, until he married and moved away.

I was all eyes and all ears as the silence in the truck made it too easy for my mind to wander.
 I wasn‚Äôt allowed any background noise.
 I was parked at the far end of the lot with the front end of my truck against a fence as I was instructed to do.
 I was impatiently waiting when I finally saw one of the scraggly dressed officers wandered by pushing a grocery basket full of bags looking like a homeless person.
 He had an old torn jacket on with a beanie on his head.
 He was unshaven and looked the part of a vagrant.
 We had a moment of eye contact and he had no expression as if he didn‚Äôt know me at all.
 It was a slight reassurance but I still wondered where the rest of them were and how they would get to me quick if things went to Hell.
 I received another call from the officer and he had me speak so they could tune in the wire.
 He said that they needed to occasionally check the wire‚Äîfrom time to time I should say something to reassure them that they‚Äôd end up with a quality recording of the deal.

Recently the OECD has presented the main planks of an employment strategy to stimulate economic growth in the industrial nations, make labour markets more flexible, increase productivity, and revamp employment and unemployment security provisions.
 The relative success of the US economy in creating jobs during the past decade has prompted other countries to emphasize the importance of policies to increase the flexibility of wage rates and bring down the price of labour by reductions in the statutory minimum wage.
 The main effect of this policy is likely to be a movement of jobs between nations, however, not a significant increase in the total number of jobs available.
 In fact, measures which reduce wage incomes could have the perverse effect of reducing aggregate purchasing power and employment.
 Economic growth is recognized as an essential, though not sufficient, condition for higher rates of job growth ‚Äì but fears of inflation constrain industrial countries from trying to stimulate faster expansion of their economies.
 The primary impact of moderate levels of inflation would be to encourage an outflow of investment to more stable currencies.
 How ever, if the industrial nations all agreed to relax their monetary policies, this effect could be minimized.
 The real constraint on job creation in the industrial nations is not the price of labour, but the need for increased capital investment, partly to counter the effects of reduced military spending and the drastic fall in output and demand in Eastern Europe.
 Increasing public investment to stimulate employment is constrained by widespread concern about rising levels of public debt.
 Recent reports state that the gross debt of OECD countries has risen from 35 per cent of GDP in 1970 to 70 per cent in 1993.

ncrease public investment to create employment. given the potential for higher92m levels0m of debt, OECD policymakers need to reduce the real size of public debt, but also to reduce the actual size of the effect of monetary policy, mainly by reducing public investment. According to the92m Ministry0m92m of0m Finance, future policies for increased public investment should be designed to improve the productivity of the labour force, increase exports of non-essential92m goods0m, and the import and export competitiveness of the economy.<eop><eod>92m 0m.... in my

He'd sat in the garden until nearly 9:00 Tuesday evening.
 He'd slept hardly at all that night, but he dragged himself to work anyway, not wanting to spend all day alone in the house.
 He'd gotten practically nothing done, and coming home at 8:30 had been torture.
 He'd spent that evening and yesterday evening doing exactly what he was doing tonight: sitting in front of the TV, not seeing, not hearing, not moving.
 How could she have become so much a part of him in only five weeks?
 He'd been engaged to a woman who hadn't been as deeply imbedded in his heart and soul as Marie.
 How could his life ever be complete again without her?
 He wondered if she was feeling the same way.
 Was she finding that home wasn't the same as it had been before she'd fallen in love with him?
 Did she wonder how she could ever feel complete again?

 I tried to pry his fingers from my neck but I couldn‚Äôt get my fingers between his to loosen his grip.
 I finally got one of my hands wrapped around one of his fingers, but it wasn‚Äôt enough to free myself.
 I believed it was going to be over soon and I was going to die.
 I could see him clearly now that my eyes had adjusted to the darkness, and he looked like a madman just inches from my face as he continued to push me up against the door.
 He didn‚Äôt mutter a word from his gritted teeth.

I slipped the tip of the sword down to the tracker‚Äôs leg, just above where his knee met the ground, and sliced his trousers up to the thigh to reveal bare skin.
 Drawing the snake close with magic, I took it in my hand, its thin green body writhing over my left palm, the sword grasped in my right.
 The prisoner watched me, almost smug.
 It was a small snake, its white belly confirming it was nonvenomous, its frame no thicker than my pinkie, but it would do.
 I slid the tip of the sword across the skin above the man‚Äôs knee, making a narrow incision.
 His expression did change then, giving way to uncertainty.
 I smiled at him as the sword tip rested against his leg.
 In measured movements, I placed the snake on the base of the blade, letting it slide toward its mark.
 I closed my eyes to relax, settle into the snake as I had the bird.
 My knees buckled as I released too much and I had to back off, giving myself just enough to control it.

 All of a sudden, Emily walked towards the dragon.
 Seth yelled at her to get back but she ignored him.
 She stood right in front of its head and opened her mouth, bizarre sounds started coming out.
 We all stood there mesmerized as she grunted, growled, snorted and hissed at the dragon.
 I expected it to just take a huge bite out of her, but it seemed as surprised as we were.

But when they saw me, they jumped aside.
 That whole summer, I struck terror into many hearts on account of I had backed down two of Pacific Beach‚Äôs toughest.
 At parties and the beach, girls who got upset and spiteful toward their boyfriends would appear at my side in hopes the boyfriend would object and I would thrash him.
 At Carmen Ranch Club, Eric was on the trampoline, probably showing off for his friend Carol, when he soared too high and got distracted by something.
 He fell sideways, ricocheted off the rail and landed on asphalt.
 Scraped and bruised all over, he went home with Carol, who lived nearby.
 Her parents were gone.
 Whatever they did that afternoon, Eric wouldn‚Äôt say.
 But something went wrong, and it sent him into a funk so deep, he gave up the job and asked did I want to go camping up the coast.

When he returned, the sight of him stole my breath.
 His worn traveling clothes were gone, exchanged for dark gray and black, a leather vest covering his shirt, the laces loose at his chest.
 A long, dark cloak was clasped at his shoulders, the material thick and coarse, so unlike the soft robes the rest of council wore.
 I knew I was gaping at him, but there was something so strange about it.
 He caught my eye and I let my gaze fall to his sword belt, struggling to gather my composure.
 I had to remind myself that he despised me.

Rick had planned to go to the office for a while the next morning, but his friend Dirk called to challenge him to a couple of games of racquetball.
 "Didn't wake you up, did I?"
 Dirk asked as they warmed up.
 "No--I was in bed reading the paper."
 "I was in bed too--and desperately needed to get out.
 Thanks for the rescue."
 Rick shook his head.
 Dirk, at 28 three years younger than Rick, was as leery of marriage as Rick, but for different reasons.
 He liked having a variety of women to choose from, frequently juggled more than one relationship--if you could call them that--at once, and sometimes seemed to enjoy getting caught at it so that he could put his charm to a real test.
 "I ran into Kim the other day."

Oh, Kim," she said and held his hand for a long moment. "I'm sorry." He nodded. "I love you so much92m,0m Kim, and I miss you."

Mrs. Sorenson, my biology teacher, was a skinny old woman with curly white hair that looked like Greek paintings of Medusa.
 She made me introduce myself to the class and then let me slink over to my assigned seat.
 I left the class even more depressed than I'd been when I woke up.
 I'd kind of known I'd have an incredible amount of material to catch up on from the first part of the semester.
 I hadn't anticipated that every other student was going to spend the class carefully ignoring me.
 I'd never really fit in, but this was unbelievable.
 New students could always count on someone to offer to be their friends.
 I'd seen it a dozen times before as people had moved in.
 The really attractive people got drawn into the popular circles, less cool people were offered a place with the punks, the nerds, or at least with the drug users, who didn't care as much what you looked or acted like as long as you were hooked on something illegal.
 I knew I had serious problems, but I didn't think they were obvious to everyone that looked at me.

The side door slides open revealing two men in black suits.
 Everyone starts to dive for cover.
 I am seated next to Grandpa but I am now flat on the ground with the rest of the crowd attempting to duck the flying flowers, tripods, and debris, expecting a shower of bullets.
 Chairs are scattering as they tip over and who knows what those two men in the helicopter are going to do?
 I look up and the only man standing is Grandpa who has his arms in the air as the wind from the copter pounds him and ripples his suit like a flag in the wind.
 This deeply religious (and senile) old man proclaims loudly ‚Äúthe lord has come to take my son!‚Äù and he continues to repeat this line as if he is a TV preacher in a revival tent.
 I have an eye on the copter and a hand on Grandpa‚Äôs leg as I attempt to pull him to the ground with the rest of us.
 People are barely audible but they are screaming and crying and in total panic.
 The men reach inside the helicopter and they hold what appear to be large boxes.

 Doi‚Äôvan and Rodregas had to manhandle the wagon around a few corners which was easier to do than it should have been, but Celestial and Hellborn strength together made short work of it.
 Then, as they finally started to level out into the small little valley of the hollow, the hair all over Rodregas‚Äô body suddenly stood up on end and his skin shivered.

 We walked for several minutes before rounding a corner and finding the entrance to a hedge maze.

 When she returned to the house nearly half an hour later, she stormed past him and up to her room.
 Rick knew for sure that she was mad this time, knew why, and knew he'd been wrong to do what he'd done.

You could have at least picked something good like Batman.
 Jim ‚Äì Sumo has always been there for me in my times of need.
 Liz ‚Äì  Really?
 Jim ‚Äì Yeah, till mom found out what they meant to me.
 She burned my collection when I was at school one day.
 At least all the comics she could find anyways.
 I hid the rest.
 (shakes his head) I had every edition of Sumo Assassin all in mint condition.
 They‚Äôd be worth a fortune now to another collector.

He was quite a ways away, and his lovely eyes were covered by a pair of sunglasses, but I somehow knew he was looking at me.
 He handed Rachel a helmet but continued to look at us, at me, while she put it on.
 I was moving again, but my pulse sped up as Rachel grabbed a hold of her brother and swung her leg over the pillion seat on the bike.
 She seemed to see us for the first time as a cold chill arced down my back and the horizon started to vibrate.
 I managed to raise my hand in response to her wave, but it was an absent motion.
 My attention was still on Alec and his unwavering stare.
 Rachel leaned forward as if to say something to him, and he finally nodded and dropped the bike into gear.
 A few seconds later the pair was screaming out of the parking lot, and my breathing was too labored for it to be anything other than a full-blown panic attack.
 I made it another couple steps, just far enough to grab Britney as I started to fall.
 I had a split second to be grateful I'd lost all of that weight so Britney wouldn't collapse under me, and then the darkness claimed me.

When we stopped for the evening, he pulled me down from my horse and stayed near as we sat on large stones around a fire.
 Ruby was telling stories again and everyone gave her their full attention‚Ä¶ everyone but us.
 ‚ÄúHow do you feel?‚Äù he asked.
 I shrugged.
 ‚ÄúFine, I guess.‚Äù He seemed unusually concerned.
 He was also sitting unusually close.
 He spoke in a low voice, though the others didn‚Äôt appear to be listening.
 I had to strain to hear.

We'd been through this more than once since he'd killed Brandon.
 He'd been so sure he was going to die that he'd relaxed his normally rigid rules.
 Since then he'd done everything possible to keep me at arm's length.
 Everything short of sending me away.
 Growing up with the example of his mother was a powerful object lesson regarding what happened to humans that got involved with shape shifters; but given enough time, I'd exploit that tiny piece of him that wanted exactly what I wanted.
 "Unless you're sending me away there's no point in having this conversation.
 I'm exactly where I want to be.
 It's not like I'm throwing myself at you this very second.
 Have you come up with an explanation for that yet?"
 Alec stared back up at the clouds rather than meet my eyes.

The ring of spectators dissolved as kids quickly returned to their tables.
 Brandon and his friends left through one set of cafeteria doors, while Alec and his friends departed through the other.
 Britney looked like she was trying to decide whether to be mad or impressed, but I felt too sick to stick around and try to nudge her in either direction.
 I mumbled something I hoped sounded intelligible and headed towards the bathroom.
 I passed Mr. Simms and another teacher on my way out, but apparently I looked as awful as I felt.
 They just shot me stern looks rather than stopping me to ask what had happened.
 It wasn't until I'd finished dry-heaving and was trying to clean myself back up, that I wondered where they'd been.
 The school building wasn't that big.
 If they'd really been trying to break up the fight, they should have arrived minutes earlier.
 I thought about hiding in the bathroom for a while, but that was exactly the kind of place a girl like Cassie would want to catch me.

 Qurrah leaned forward, clutching at his tormenter‚Äôs shaking hands.
 Words spilled from the half-orc‚Äôs mouth, garbled and nearly unintelligible.
 ‚ÄúWhat is it you wish to say to me?‚Äù the elf asked, ignoring the flailing hands that pawed at his face.

He grabbed the blade and flung it out of the man's arms.
 He roared angrily and threw his sword down on Seth, who raised his up to block it.
 Seth pushed back, but I could see him shaking.
 Right when I thought he was winning, my mouth dropped open.
 Time seemed to slow as one of the other faery guys ran over to Seth and the one he was locked with.
 The faery raised one of the hilts of his sword and brought it down on Seth.
 It collided with his head and Seth dropped his sword.
 He crumpled to ground and didn't move.
 ‚ÄúSeth!‚Äù I screamed.
 He didn't move and one of the faery men reached down to grab him but I screeched, ‚ÄúLeave him alone!‚Äù and sent an arrow into the guy's neck.

But I didn‚Äôt want to go back to the village, not ever.
 And I only had this one chance, this small moment before they came to retrieve me.
 I grabbed the dress off the tree branch‚Äîthe last evidence of me being here‚Äîand threw it into the pack.
 Swinging it around onto my back, I started to run.
 I didn‚Äôt know where I was or where the map would take me, but I finally had a purpose.
 There were mountains burned into my palms, and there was only one place to find mountains: In the north.
 I couldn‚Äôt remember much of life before going to live with my aunt Fannie.
 The village and surrounding meadows and forests were the only home I‚Äôd had, the only place I‚Äôd known.
 It wasn‚Äôt exactly a comforting place, but there was something to be said for knowing where you were, where to find food, shelter, and water.

 try to seduce her?
 He loved her and desperately wanted to make love to her, and her response to him was passionate and unrestrained.
 But she was confused--he knew that.
 And he knew that she was a virgin.
 He'd felt her initial hesitation when he'd tried to coax her lips apart, felt the shock go through her body when his tongue had touched hers.
 The fact that she'd found the kiss exciting didn't change the fact that she was an innocent.
 Or that she was far from home.
 Or that she was engaged to another man.
 He had no qualms about wooing her away from her fianc√©, but how could she be anything but confused when she couldn't even talk to the man?

A Big Change
 Though I continued to long for Karen Flagstad, I began to roam.
 For some months after meeting Gloria at the San Onofre campground, I frequently drove to South Gate, just south of L.A., a hundred miles each way, to feast on her grandmother‚Äôs cooking, get scrutinized by her dad and brothers, take her to drive-in movies and smooch until her midnight curfew, then race home so fast the sleepy cops along Highway 101 failed to notice the blur as I passed.
 But Mexican dads like hers expect their girls‚Äô novios to marry or que se vayan a la fregada.
 Meaning scram.
 And after the second time I chose North Beach over her company, Gloria informed me her former boyfriend had returned on leave from the Marines.
 We shouted at each other long-distance and parted.
 Eric still didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend.
 I had decided he didn‚Äôt want to hurt dozens of girls by choosing another over them.
 Too soon, I would learn about other reasons.

In an effort to cover my embarrassment, I turned back to Rachel and James, only to feel my jaw figuratively hit the ground.
 James was standing between Rachel and Brandon, slightly crouched in a posture that looked strangely familiar.
 I heard footsteps to my left as Brandon finished crossing the last few feet between us.
 James backed up a half step, one arm stretched out behind him, pushing Rachel back.
 I suddenly realized why his movements seemed so familiar.
 I'd seen dozens of celebrities being shepherded out of one award show or another by professional bodyguards who acted exactly like James was acting right now.
 Only they usually weren't so obvious about it.
 The only time I'd ever seen a bodyguard physically push their client around was when some up-and-coming soap star had a bottle thrown at her by the wife of someone she was sleeping with.
 I looked past Brandon, expecting to see something threatening headed towards us.
 I even opened my mouth to warn Brandon, but there wasn't anything there, just Brandon, still with the same casual smile as he reached out and squeezed my arm.

 He laughed.
 The cold air helped a little.
 I was back in the circle, the group of us sitting around a small fire.
 Ruby was telling stories.
 She related the tale of Bonnie Bell, a blue fairy from the East.
 ‚ÄúHe hunts the human children, luring them in with glitter and lights, and eats them, beginning with their tiny little toes.
 Though he gives no choice in the matter, in exchange, he allows the mother one wish.‚Äù I scoffed, ‚ÄúHumans aren‚Äôt real.‚Äù ‚ÄúEven so,‚Äù she continued, smiling wickedly, ‚Äúyou‚Äôd be surprised how many don‚Äôt think to wish for their children back.‚Äù Raucous laughter floated up around the ring.
 Fairy tales indeed.
 It felt good being there, surrounded by my new companions, a fire and stories, laughter.

It was bad enough that my heart was shattering as I said it, the look in Alec's face made everything a hundred times worse.
 For a second I thought the earth was shaking, but it was Alec, trembling much like he'd done Friday night.
 A loud crack from beside us made me jump.
 Alec looked at the branch, easily as thick as my arm, which he'd just torn from the tree we were leaning against.
 He stopped shaking as he considered what he'd done to the poor tree.
 "You're saying that because you're worried for me?
 Not because you really want to go back to him?"
 I shook my head, as confused by his reaction, by how close he'd come to losing control, as I was by my not having felt threatened.

 Talk about humility.
 The Commandment
 A song reminds me of 1 John 3:23, ‚ÄúThis is his commandment, to believe in the name of his son, Jesus, and to love one another as he commanded us.‚Äù Again I think about the power of a single word to change us, and redirect our lives, and perhaps give us the ability to change others and the world.
 But I suspect it‚Äôs not likely to do so unless we stop and wrestle with its meanings.
 In an essay on writing short stories, Andre Dubus advised that when we get stuck, instead of stopping or attempting to go forward, we should try going deeper.
 On this trip, I have attempted to deepen my understanding of the word ‚Äúadore.‚Äù Now I‚Äôm trying to do the same with some words in John‚Äôs admonition, because I feel my mind or the Spirit telling me that everything we need to know to live in goodness and beauty may be contained in those few lines.
 John tells us to ‚Äúbelieve in‚Äù the name of the Son.
 While at a glance this could be taken to mean we should simply believe that Jesus existed, it doesn‚Äôt.
 Because ‚Äúbelieve in‚Äù denotes more than credulity.

Jesus is related to the whole of humanity. John tells92m us0m to ‚Äúbelieve in the name of the Father,‚Äù to ‚Äúbelieve in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ,‚Äù ‚Äúbelieve in the name of Jesus,‚Äù to believe the Christ Spirit, and to ‚Äúbelieve in Jesus, the Jesus Christ Son,‚Äù ‚Äúbelieve92m in0m the Christ Spirit,‚Äù ‚Äúbelieve in the name of the Jesus Christ our Lord,92m Jesus0m Christ,‚Äù ‚Äúbelieve fully in92m Jesus0m92m,‚Äù0m ‚Äúbelieve in the Father,‚Äù ‚Äú

Alec shook his head.
 "This isn't the time; we need to get you back home to your mom.
 It would be most unfortunate if she were to arrive and find you gone."
 My mind was still a little fuzzy, but it was working well enough for me to know he was wrong.
 "No.
 She's not going to be home until Sunday.
 There isn't any reason to go back there yet."
 I looked around for Rachel, but she'd disappeared sometime between when I'd started falling, and when I'd thought to thank her.
 "You mean she wasn't planning on coming back until Sunday.
 Once Brandon gets involved in things, they tend not to go as expected."

At the same time, it also raises the wages of less-skilled jobs in low-wage countries by increasing the demand for workers to produce for overseas markets.
 The problem in the more developed countries is that the demand for low-skilled jobs declines and the gap in wages between skilled and unskilled jobs tends to increase, resulting in a decline in incomes and employment opportunities for lower levels of the population in these countries.
 This is a natural, healthy process of social development in which different sectors serve as engines for growth at different stages.
 The upward job displacement that earlier shifted job opportunities from agriculture to industry now shifts them to higher-skilled jobs in manufacturing and services.
 The negative side-effects of this process on some sections of the population alert us to areas where society must make special efforts to speed their development.
 As in the case of technology, research is needed to document this complex process across industries, between countries and over time.
 One product of these studies could be the development of specific job coefficients measuring the impact of growth in trade in different industries on overall employment.
 Trade becomes of even greater potential benefit to industrial nations during the coming decade when economic growth in these countries is expected to be significantly slower than in the developing world.
 The pent-up demand generated by the destruction of Europe during the Second World War, the rapid expansion of population during the baby boom generation, and the explosion of new technologies in the past few decades, all generated strong internal demand in the OECD countries, resulting in steady economic growth.
 The slow growth of population and productivity in more recent years means that these factors cannot be expected to drive further economic expansion at the same rate.

he above, it is also important to understand92m the0m effects of economic growth and that the rate of an increase in the number of jobs and incomes in industrialized countries is not a phenomenon92m in0m itself. It is a consequence of the growth of the number of sectors, particularly agriculture and manufacturing, and92m their0m income92m of0m92m,0m and the further growth in the incomes and number of jobs in the developing world will contribute to both economic prosperity in the developing world and to the reduction of poverty in these countries.<eop><cls>

Both democracy and market-oriented economies decentralize authority and decision making, providing the essential legal and regulatory framework and empowering the individual to choose and act with minimum direction or interference from above.
 Both depend for their success on the quality of those choices, which means on the quality of education and information possessed by the mass of people, and on the freedom and dynamism of the population.
 In contrast, authoritarian systems and command economies centralize decision making, restrict the flow of information to the public, foster vast unresponsive bureaucracies, limit individual freedom and initiative within narrow bounds, and encourage obedience and conformity rather than innovation.
 The spread of education, which fosters independent thinking, and dissemination of information through the media were important factors in undermining public acceptance of communism in Eastern Europe.
 In a real sense, it was Gorbachev‚Äôs policy of glasnost that brought down the Iron Curtain.
 It opened up an insular society and exposed it to an avalanche of new information, new ideas and new possibilities, which released a fervent aspiration in the people for a better life.
 Over the last few years, democratization has been especially dynamic in Africa, where it has been dubbed Africa‚Äôs Second Liberation.
 During the first three decades of post-colonial independence, almost all of the continent‚Äôs 54 states had come under either single-party or military rule.
 The preference for authoritarian rule was often justified by the need for rapid economic development, which could be impeded by opposition to government policies and by the need to contain regional and tribal conflicts.
 Neither of these claims has proven true.

uation remains similar internationally and in the United States, but with the92m development0m92m of0m democratization and the welfare state, the92m West0m has become a dominant market economy and92m then0m an authoritarian economy.<eop> Both market and authoritarian economies, however, favor the West, in an important way, over the West.

But he was also breathing deeply and through the bond she knew he was trying to control himself.
 Imeralda saw that Rodregas was also watching Doi‚Äôvan.
 She thought he also recognized the danger of a Hellborn rage.
 Imeralda reached out to Rodregas first to try to get him to calm down and help manage Doi‚Äôvan.
 Imeralda focused on their bond and looked him in the eyes and said, ‚ÄúRodregas getting angry will not change things, let‚Äôs sit down and talk to the village elders.

The World Summit on Social Development should call for a comprehensive World Employment Programme to stimulate more rapid growth in developing countries as an engine for global economic expansion.
 The International Labour Organization has operated a programme for the past two decades, but solution of the employment problem requires an integrated approach that transcends the scope of any single international agency.
 The programme should establish specific objectives and co ordinate efforts to stimulate international investment, increase labour market flexibility, promote productive skills, diffuse technology, eliminate protectionist trade policies that retard growth, increase trade between developing countries, and promote international cooperation on taxation systems to encourage more labour-oriented tax codes.
 2.Coordination of macro-economic policies: The efforts of the industrial nations to achieve higher rates of economic growth and job creation are stymied by the need to maintain macro-economic stability at the same time.
 Due to the competition between OECD members to attract financial resources, rising interest rates or falling inflation rates in one country influence the inflow and outflow of financial resources from other members of the community.
 The efforts to curb inflation at the expense of slower economic growth and job creation need not be so rigorous, if OECD members more closely coordinated their policies to support macro-economic expansion.
 A modest, relatively uniform rise in inflation rates within the OECD would not then result in a significant movement of resources or fluctuation in exchange rates.
 3.Shift investment from defence to education and training: Reduce global defence spending by an additional 50 per cent before the end of the decade to below a maximum threshold of $400 billion.
 Invest at least 10 per cent of the global savings from defence cuts in education and training.
 4.Liberalize agricultural and textile exports: Utilize agriculture as an engine of industrialization, international trade and employment generation by reducing the barriers to a major expansion of agricultural production and exports from and between developing countries.

 And it is not like you are fighting someone who deserves to die.

 ‚ÄúTrue, hopefully another day of this though and we will be back to fighting those we should be fighting, and it will be far harder to stop me if I achieve a greater sigil.‚Äù Imeralda crouched down, she had a very serious expression on her face, and Rodregas had a sense that he was not going to like what she said next.

One of the messengers is from a neighboring lord and one from the Guild of the Celestial Path.
 What rights does the lord have in this situation?‚Äù Rodregas noticed the sorcerer seemed to stiffen at the question.
 Rodregas‚Äô mind swirled.
 The first questions had been easy, but it had been a very long time since he had studied law.
 The sorcerer‚Äôs body language, though, directed his memory to the answer.
 Rodregas said, ‚ÄúThe local lord is responsible for replacing the other lord messenger‚Äôs lame horse.
 There is nothing to be done for the Immortalist messenger‚Äôs horse.
 It is the responsibility of the local lords to provide mounts for the Guild at the local lord‚Äôs expense.‚Äù He made sure his voice remained rough with no emotion coloring his response, just a simple squire giving a by-the-book answer.
 The Knight Captain nodded and said, ‚ÄúWelcome to the tournament, Squire.‚Äù He then turned to look up at the sorcerer and asked him, ‚ÄúAny other questions Ambassador?‚Äù The sorcerer spoke his next question directly to Rodregas, ‚ÄúI noticed you have a Hellborn at your side, you would insult the faith of the Knights by bringing him into the Cathedral of the Heavens?‚Äù Rodregas knew this question would come up and had the natural answer, ‚ÄúThey are my sworn followers.

What a waste, she always sighed, looking at him with reproach.
 A woman would love having that garden, but what did a man know about flowers?
 Truthfully, he knew very little, Rick mused as he set his cartons of Chinese on the counter and went to change clothes.
 He just knew that he enjoyed their beauty and scent.
 But he could never admit that to Lauri; she'd accuse him of being a romantic.
 He really was, deep down, he supposed.
 But he'd had so many bad experiences that he was rapidly becoming something of a cynic.
 He'd thought he'd been in love with Sabrina, but she'd been too demure, too clingy.
 He'd begun feeling smothered.

 I heard some movement off to my right, but was so focused on Brandon's response that none of it really registered.
 The smile gracing his breathtaking face was like the ultimate treat.

I then told her that I had a refill available for ninety Oxys that was good to fill next Tuesday.
 I swear I am making this dialogue up as I go along, just to fit all the necessary criteria and to put her off until next Tuesday.
 The new prescription combined with what I already had would meet the quantity of one hundred Oxys that they wanted.
 I also wanted a solid clarification that I was only going to meet on my terms, just as I had in my fictitious deal.
 Did I mention I am in sales?
 Telling her I sold the drugs to someone else is the classic ‚Äútake-away‚Äù which creates an urgency and desire to comply.
 She said they would buy the Oxys and they would meet me where I wanted.
 She assured me that there would be no bullshit this time.

‚ÄúWith exposure comes understanding.

Its rank claws touched his face, turning the sweat on his brow to ice.
 The arrow squirmed deeper.
 Qurrah focused every bit of his will upon it, desperately seeking to repulse it.
 His well of energy, which he‚Äôd thought empty, burgeoned and over-flowed.
 The arrow snapped, banishing the necromancer‚Äôs presence, but leaving a solitary impression squatting at the back of Qurrah‚Äôs mind:
 Curiosity.
 Qurrah opened his eyes.
 He lay on his back in his brother‚Äôs arms, yet he didn‚Äôt remember falling.

I swear I could feel him shaking from exhilaration.
 ‚ÄúWhatever, you‚Äôre now an official maniac.‚Äù I pulled out my hunting knife.
 ‚ÄúManiacs get destroyed by me.
 No maniacs are allowed to exist except for me and Emily.‚Äù He jumped off as I stabbed the one on my arm.
 I grabbed my bow and shot him with an arrow before he his little legs could he him very far.
 He fell to the ground, the arrow sticking straight up at the sky.
 Now the forest was maniac free.
 I killed the others and looked up to find the thrashers dead too, probably courtesy of Seth.
 A few dwarfs were also lying dead in front of Emily.
 I walked back to my body and closed my eyes.

Even after I looked away with a flush of embarrassment, I still felt like I could feel his eyes watching me.
 I could feel his presence behind and to the left of me, like a gentle tingle of electricity I could've pointed to even with my eyes closed.
 I resisted the urge to look back again as the lights dimmed and the orchestra began the opening strains of the first number.
 The actor playing Jean Valjean strode out onto the stage, and even weighed down by chains, he still commanded everyone's attention as though he was a member of the nobility.
 Each successive character somehow managed to latch onto my heart as they arrived.
 Despite the nagging sensation that I could feel Alec behind me, the first few minutes of the play exceeded all my hopes.
 That all changed when they started 'Lovely Ladies'.
 It was my absolute least favorite song on the whole soundtrack.
 Frankly the whole play would've been better if they'd just left it off.
 Still, sitting through a song about 'ladies of the night' as my mom still called them, had seemed like a small price to pay for getting to listen to the rest of the play.

Billy and I discussed and concluded Eric would explain to the teachers about how Kenny‚Äôs folks‚Äô divorce was making him crazy.
 Eric would promise to pay for the window, and get himself and Kenny pardoned.
 But somebody had called the police.
 Though Kenny ran like the cartoon mouse Speedy Gonzales, he wasn‚Äôt as good at hiding.
 The police found him crouched behind a bus bench on his way circling back to the lot where he had parked his mom‚Äôs Volkswagen.
 They consulted the witnesses and booked Kenny for vandalism.
 The teachers to whom Eric surrendered turned him over to the police, who drove him home to Sylvia and sent a report about him to the school board.
 A few days later, Eric and Kenny got expelled for having been intoxicated on school grounds.
 Mrs. Hazel Bole, our vice principal, summoned Billy and me.

Shift to Services: One would hardly expect to find the decline of manufacturing jobs as a source of employment opportunities, but historical data supports this conclusion.
 Fear over the destruction of manufacturing jobs due to adoption of capital intensive technology has been prevalent for the past 100 years.
 Every new technology that automates a process or increases worker productivity has been perceived as a threat to the future of work.
 The reality has proved to be quite different.
 Technological development propels a spiral of economic development that creates many more jobs than it destroys.
 The most striking testimony to this fact is the history of employment in USA, arguably the country that has most readily and fully adopted new technologies over the past century.
 Employment in manufacturing and mining grew to a peak of about 40 per cent of the workforce after World War II before beginning its downward spiral to 15 per cent by 2000, about the same proportion as in 1850.
 Yet, during this same period total employment in America has expanded phenomenally, from a mere 13 million workers in 1870 to 68 million in 1955 and more than 136 million in 2002.
 In spite of all the automation and all the export of jobs to lower wage economies, the percentage of the American population employed has continued to rise over time.
 Several factors are responsible for this result, among which population growth and technological development are most prominent.

The growth in percentage of the population employed in employment, in manufacturing and92m mining0m and the decline in wages combined with the increase in wages and the decline of wages, the expansion of the economy and the decline of wages, has averaged more than 60 per cent since92m 18500m.

Her eyes narrowed when she replied to him, matter-of-factly, ‚ÄúYour mouth is very small.

 Anvil laughed and his tongue wagged.
 He was holding someone by the arm, preventing them from running away.
 Suddenly, my vision changed and I was a hawk, attacking, tearing a piece from his tongue.
 And Chevelle.
 He was in so many of my dreams.
 We were sparring sometimes, clashing swords.
 Sometimes he was pummeling me with rocks.
 Other times, the moments would have surely made me blush, if I could have felt my cheeks.

There is still time and that time is now.
 The world today has far greater opportunities that ever before, far greater degrees of freedom within which to act to accelerate progress and eradicate suffering.
 The Millennium Development Goals adopted at the UN Millennium Summit in 2000 represent the essential minimum needs for building a stable, secure, free and prosperous global community.
 We confront once again an unprecedented opportunity and an unfinished agenda.
 Disappointed by our failure to achieve all that seemed possible or disillusioned by the emergence of new, more dreadful challenges, some may feel prompted to curb mind‚Äôs contemplation of the greater potentials, dispense with lofty plans and resign themselves to the slower, circuitous pace of progress that characterized earlier periods.
 That choice would be unfortunate.
 For everything in our experience of the past two decades points to the fact that humankind is now capable of more rapid and radical action to build a better common present and future for all.
 We may have become habituated to the astounding magnitude of the events since 1989 and still feel unsatisfied with the results, but we can no longer deny that we collectively possess the capacity to create the world that we choose to create.
 This is still the hour in which anything can happen, provided we are determined to make it happen.
 It is not a question of possibility or prediction, but of decision and determination to walk the talk.

It seemed like such a waste, leaving the grotto after all the work that'd been put into transforming it, but Alec waved away my protests.
 He easily cradled me in one arm, while carefully picking up my painting with his free hand.
 A short time later, we were back inside the house and headed towards his room.
 Cuddled up against his chest with the familiar, warm tingle caressing my skin, my system apparently decided I was completely safe, and started shutting down.
 I was doing a fairly respectable job of hiding my drooping eyelids, but all my efforts were undone by the prodigious yawn that ambushed me as he set me down on the bed.
 "I'm not tired, I promise."
 His eyebrow arched in disbelief as I pulled him down onto the bed, and I found myself admitting the truth.
 "Okay, I might be a little tired, but it isn't a big deal.
 I want to spend as much time with you as possible.
 After all, it isn't like I'm going to be able to really get much rest between now and whenever we need to leave for the challenge."

 She has to hate me."
 Brandon shook his head and flashed another of his winning smiles, albeit one with an overtone of sympathy.
 "I'm sure it isn't as bad as that."
 I wanted to disagree, to go into detail about why my life had just taken a turn for the worse, but something about his manner was suddenly distant.
 I thought about calling him out on it, but with my life suddenly looking like I was all but friendless, that didn't seem like such a good idea.
 Without really meaning to I'd managed to alienate just about everyone at school.
 Brandon already had plenty of reasons not to be with me, it was the height of stupidity to give him any more.

 But I can‚Äôt give up remembering Eric, and memories I left behind long ago appear.

Rodregas threw himself toward the last guard.
 He blocked the sword blow with his borrowed shield but did not have the angle to avoid a direct impact.
 The sword sliced through the shield and Rodregas jerked his arm back fearing that he would lose it.
 Rodregas managed to get in close and, abandoning his useless short sword, grabbed his opponent‚Äôs shield and pulled him in.
 The guard tried to shrug him off, his bearded face looked afraid.
 His eyes, a light blue, stared at Rodregas with revulsion.
 He was probably wondering how Rodregas could be strong enough to take on an Immortal Guard.
 Rodregas knew from the guard‚Äôs fear that he had him, he was not thinking clearly.
 Rodregas growled at him, letting him feel his anger and rage at taking slaves to be used by the Immortalists.

 One after another the deft strokes came in, and one after another Antonil batted them away using the methodical style that had helped him rise to his place at the top of the Neldaren army.
 His opponent, a young elf whose swordplay was raw compared to most of his brethren, tried to give him no reprieve.

"Why would you not dating very much have any impact on how I feel about you?"
 "Because in addition to being the most thoughtful boy I've ever met, you also happen to be rich enough to buy a small country.
 You're so incredibly gorgeous girls swoon when you walk into a room.
 How can I possibly compete against the kinds of girls who'll continue throwing themselves at you for as long as you're breathing?"
 Anger managed to accomplish what all of the swallowing hadn't.
 The diatribe that'd started out nearly inaudible had grown in volume until by the end I was hissing loud enough the people closest to us turned around in curiosity.
 Alec calmly captured my wildly gesturing hands, immobilizing them with a casual strength that made me feel like a child.

I spotted a small toad as it leapt across the clearing in a desperate attempt to escape the inferno.
 I concentrated on it, willing it to change.
 Its wide body started to swell, sides bubbling out, puffing it into a tiny green balloon.

 It burst, spewing entrails across the hem of my dress.
 My head fell into my hands as I groaned.
 It took a while, but the anger eventually faded to a point where I realized I‚Äôd need a new plan.
 I couldn‚Äôt help but regret the flames had consumed the documents that had caused all this to begin with.

The fading spectre of nuclear annihilation gave way in the 1990s to the rising spectre of chronic unemployment.
 The end of the Cold War brought with it some wrenching transitions, among them the break-up of the USSR and Comecom, the reunification of Germany, the downsizing of defence manufacturers in America as the result of reduced orders for war materiel, the collapse of Japanese financial markets and onset of a decade-long recession, and displacement of millions of migrant Asian workers following the invasion of Kuwait and the first war in Iraq.
 These events violently disrupted expansion of the world economy and creation of employment opportunities for an expanding labour force in both industrialized and developing countries.
 Near panic levels of concern rippled across the world during this period about rising levels of joblessness, prompting one doomsday author to prophesize the ‚Äòend of work‚Äô.
 The situation became particularly acute in developing countries, because of their predominately young populations and high population growth rates.
 Trends and Prospects
 ICPF refused to side with the pessimists who viewed unemployment as a terminal illness spreading rapidly through the entire world economic system.
 Its report presented evidence to dispel the twin myths that technological development and trade were net job destroyers.
 It traced the growth of employment opportunities through the 20th Century, a century of unprecedented technological development and commercial expansion, to show that this period has also been an era of unprecedented growth in the quantity and quality of employment opportunities.
 The report argued that the current surge in joblessness was a temporary result of the mismatch between the rates of surging population growth and expanding economic activity.

spects 92mIC0mPF also argued that growth92m in0m the quantity and quality of employment opportunity that resulted from the92m growth0m of exports and capital investment, not from the expansion of financial markets and trade, had led to92m only0m a temporary increase in the level of quantity and quality of employment opportunity. ICPF sought to explain why the current level of joblessness was not yet to be, due to the creation of new employment opportunities as a result of the rapid population growth of industrialized and developing92m countries0m.<eop><eod> Trend

We were both completely soaked to the bone and even though in was the middle of summer, we were shivering.
 The boys looked completely satisfied with how we looked.
 After Emily and I gave them a look, they tore down the street and disappeared.
 Emily squeezed the bottom of her shirt, ‚ÄúI hate them so much right now.‚Äù Water gushed onto the street.
 I wrung my hair out.
 ‚ÄúI agree and if we didn‚Äôt need them, I‚Äôd be planning their funeral.‚Äù Emily smiled, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be helping you.

It was the human children, especially the poor and the destitute, that Harruq sought.
 Of course, none would be out playing, not with so many dead and missing.
 He would need to take different measures.
 Not far from their home, a ratty building operated throughout the night.
 It was Maggie‚Äôs Place, half tavern and half orphanage.
 Maggie enjoyed the free labor and the ability to rant and slap her orphan workers without fear of reprisal while still maintaining the image of a heart of gold to her regulars.
 The tavern filled the first floor, while the orphanage and a few modest rooms for rent composed the second.
 Harruq stepped into the alley beside the tavern and looked up.

All was identical to his dreams.
 A mile from town, he saw the hill, a smoldering fire atop it to guide his way.
 Waiting there was the dark man, his red eyes shining down on him as he approached.
 ‚ÄúSay the words,‚Äù the man in the black robe ordered.
 His voice was quiet but deep, a mixture of hate and malice compressed into audible form.
 ‚ÄúHow can I make such a promise to one whose name I don‚Äôt know?‚Äù Qurrah asked.
 In answer, the man in black stood.
 His eyes flared and his arms spread wide.
 All his power rolled forth, and on trembling knees the half-orc looked upon a man more ancient than the forests, more powerful than the fury of nature, and more death than life.
 ‚ÄúMy life for you,‚Äù he gasped as a fresh wave of terror crawled over him.

The Commission‚Äôs report was never intended to predict what would happen in the years to come, but rather to project what could be made to happen by a concerted, determined effort of the world community.
 The report highlighted many of the opportunities that did emerge as well as some of the dangers that have grown in intensity in the absence of effective action.
 The events of the past 15 years may not have followed the course predicted by either the optimists or the pessimists, but they certainly confirm that this has been a period of unprecedented opportunity for rapid progress ‚Äì what Sri Aurobindo termed an ‚ÄúHour of God‚Äù.
 While the gains have been significant, all of us will acknowledge that we have not taken full advantage of this opportunity to build a better world.
 Though great dangers have receded, old and new threats still loom large, demanding courageous action.
 The door remains ajar.
 The hour is still in progress.
 There is still time and that time is now.
 The world today has far greater opportunities that ever before, far greater degrees of freedom within which to act to accelerate progress and eradicate suffering.

 They sat with their arms around each other for a long time.
 Mrs. Tranton at last gave her daughter a final squeeze.
 "Would you like to go downstairs for some tea or lemonade?"
 "No, thank you.

 Mrs. Tranton rose.

Reaching inside to draw out the long white gown, I could not fathom Junnie‚Äôs reasoning.
 But she must have gone through much to get me this package.
 Numbly, I stared at her words while I unfastened my shirt and sash.
 The pouch I had rescued from the vault fell to the bed.
 How had I forgotten?
 I kicked off my shoes and pulled my top and pants off before sliding the gown over my head, straightening the length with my hands.
 The corset laced tight at my waist, the plunging neckline lower than anything I would ever wear.
 I retrieved the leather pouch from the bed to examine the contents, but before I loosened the binding I heard a crash behind me; three council guards had busted open my door.
 I tucked the pouch under the long bell sleeve of the dress as they crossed the room to seize me by the arms.

In contrast, as many as 30 million persons may have died of famine in China during the late 1950s.
 The political necessity of maintaining popular support and the threat of exposure by the media force elected governments to take all necessary steps to ensure sufficient food supplies.
 Modern democracy is the political counterpart of the market economic system.
 Historically, democracy broke the monopoly of the aristocracy over governance of the people, giving freedom and rights to the individual politically.
 The market system ‚Äì basing itself on property rights and self-determined initiatives of the individual producer and consumer ‚Äì is an economic expression of the same principle.
 Both democracy and market-oriented economies decentralize authority and decision making, providing the essential legal and regulatory framework and empowering the individual to choose and act with minimum direction or interference from above.
 Both depend for their success on the quality of those choices, which means on the quality of education and information possessed by the mass of people, and on the freedom and dynamism of the population.
 In contrast, authoritarian systems and command economies centralize decision making, restrict the flow of information to the public, foster vast unresponsive bureaucracies, limit individual freedom and initiative within narrow bounds, and encourage obedience and conformity rather than innovation.
 The spread of education, which fosters independent thinking, and dissemination of information through the media were important factors in undermining public acceptance of communism in Eastern Europe.
 In a real sense, it was Gorbachev‚Äôs policy of glasnost that brought down the Iron Curtain.

The whole world has an immense stake in the successful outcome of the transition in Eastern Europe.
 Initial Results of Reform
 The pre-existent conditions, the starting point of the transition, the timing, speed and extent of the reforms introduced during the past five years varied considerably among the 25 nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
 But, with few exceptions, they were founded on the same general principles and on the policy recommendations of Western proponents of rapid transformation to total free-market liberal capitalism, based on a simultaneous shock strategy encompassing macro-economic stabilization, prices and property rights.
 Western governments and the international financial institutions, led by the IMF, strongly advocated this approach and linked financial assistance to its adoption.
 The strategy called for rapid deregulation of prices, privatization of farms and industry, introduction of a convertible currency, and balancing the budget to reduce the high fiscal deficits, primarily by reducing military expenditure and subsidies to producers and consumers.
 The assumption was that a programme with these elements would result in a significant increase in production, efficiency and the availability of consumer goods within a short time.
 The actual results were quite contrary to the expectations of these countries‚Äô Western economic advisers, as well as to the governments and people of the region.
 The initial phase of reforms had a disastrous impact on the economies, on the people and in some countries on peace and political stability.
 From 1990 to 1993 production in all 25 nations declined drastically, from a minimum of 10 per cent in Poland, 20 percent in Hungary and 22 per cent in the Czech Republic to a maximum of 45 per cent in Russia, 57 per cent in Latvia and 75 per cent in Armenia.

n92m the0m period up to the end of 1994 to 5 percent in Belarus and 4 percent less in92m the0m Ukraine. The economies of Russia, Belarus, Ukraine,92m and0m in92m eastern0m Ukraine developed and in the recent years have become a major component of the development in the region. The objective is to bring these regions into a state of equilibrium, following92m,0m in effect, the strategies introduced during the initial phase of reforms of the past year. During this time, the pace of growth in the region has increased significantly; it

I shouldn't have bothered rushing.
 I slipped into Spanish exactly three seconds before the late bell sounded, but Mrs. Tiggs wasn't even there.
 When she finally did show up, we had a surprise quiz on our vocabulary.
 Once we finished she turned on the television and told us to listen for conjugation.
 I almost wished I shared the class with Britney, her dad seemed like the type to get six kinds of riled up over something like that.
 He'd probably go straight to the school board and demand a new Spanish teacher altogether.
 It was a real relief when I was finally able to leave the drab little classroom.

 The door was partially open when I reached Junnie‚Äôs house, so I peeked my head in and called for her.
 When she didn‚Äôt answer, I slipped in to check the back room.
 As I walked through the sparsely decorated living area, I passed a carved mirror on the wall and noticed something off in my reflection.
 I knew I was flushed, I could feel the frustration and worry, but I stopped to get a closer look.
 There was something not right with my complexion, but what was really off was just above my face.
 I squinted, leaning toward the mirror as my hands reached up of their own accord.
 The first quarter inch of my hair was blackened.
 I parted my hair in a different area and then again, but the base of my hair was dark over my entire scalp.
 My fingers began to tremble against my skin; I could come up with no plausible explanation for the change.

 In an effort to see better, Rachel and I had moved slightly to the side.

 It wasn't until his arm brushed me that I realized he was shaking ever so slightly himself.
 "There's only one way you're going to touch her, James.
 Are you really ready to take that step?"
 I felt shivers run down me as I realized just how easily everything could boil over into deadly violence.
 The tension in the room pulsed out in waves, skittering many-legged across my skin like something that belonged under a rock somewhere.
 The feeling intensified even more as first Jessica and then Jasmin picked up the same strange, near epileptic quiver.

To the left of the bed was the door to the water closet and to the left of that a wardrobe.
 Along the connecting wall the fireplace calmly burned.
 To the right of the fireplace was a dresser with a small mirror and at the foot of the bed was an ornamental trunk that matched the wardrobe.
 On first glance there was nothing of much value except for perhaps the candleholder on the dresser.

Broadening the scope to include other agricultural products, particularly textiles, the potential for accelerating global economic growth by an agriculture-led strategy is even greater.
 Cotton is a crop with a very high income and employment multiplier effect.
 Per capita cotton consumption in poorer developing countries such as India is less than half the level in China and less than a third the level in industrial nations.
 Measures of the gap between the prevailing levels of nutrition in developing countries and the levels achieved in the West reveal a huge potential for increasing demand for agricultural production, which can serve as an engine to drive the growth of the world economy.
 Extrapolation from ICPF‚Äôs studies of the employment potential of expanding agricultural production in India suggests that more than one billion jobs can be created worldwide through a strategy that focuses on raising agricultural productivity as an engine for improving diets, employment and industrialization.
 Challenges in Agriculture
 The ratio of growth of foodgrain production to population growth has entered into a period of decline over the past decade ‚Äì increasing at just one per cent per year compared to three per cent during the previous two decades.
 There is a similar trend for other staple crops and meat.
 For fish, there has actually been a net decline of seven per cent in per capita world production.
 To a large extent, this slowdown is the result of slower growth in demand, especially in industrial countries, under lining the fact that food security is predominantly an economic problem rather than a technological one.

five years, there have been declines92m in0m that of92m the0m cotton crop and in that92m of0m the foodgra92min0m crop.

I quietly swung the stall door open and felt my eyes go wide as I saw Lucy curled up, sobbing, at Jasmin's feet.
 Neither of the other girls even bothered to look at me as I carefully moved to the door.

Even in such agriculturally diverse countries as the United States and India, it has been demonstrated that better management of micro-nutrients can raise productivity substantially ‚Äì in some intensively cultivated areas by as much as 50 to 100 per cent or more in a wide variety of crops ‚Äì without significant changes in the structure or method of cultivation.
 Greater attention is needed to conserving and applying organic sources of manure and raising nitrogen-fixing crops, as well as to the use of bio-fertilizers.
 Unlike the creation of new irrigated lands, the application of such environmentally sustainable field practices is neither very costly nor technology-intensive, and can be widely propagated through improvements in agricultural training and extension.
 Increasing exports
 Over the next six years, the agreements reached during the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations are expected to reduce the tariffs levied by the industrial nations on agricultural products by 37 per cent and on tropical food exports by 43 per cent.
 Developing countries will cut agricultural tariffs by an average of 24 per cent.
 In addition, North American and Western European countries have agreed to cut agricultural subsidies by one-third.
 Together these cuts are expected to result in a 20 per cent rise in exports of agricultural and processed foods by 2005.
 The share of developing countries in this increase has been estimated at $20 billion to $60 billion annually.
 Increased trade can act as a strong stimulus to the growth of agricultural, agro-industrial and rural employment, provided that these countries respond dynamically to the opportunity by raising productivity and strengthening rural infrastructure for storage, processing and distribution.

The well of magic inside her was dry.
 In time, her strength would return, but she doubted the necromancer would give her a day to rest.
 She used a bit of the magic she did have left to summon her staff.
 If she were to die, she would die fighting any way she knew how.
 The man in black paused, extended his hands, and began to cast.
 He would give her no chance to strike.

Sammy was in the latter group.
 She'd probably been saving a question about light since we'd started the unit.
 Just in case an opportunity presented itself to earn some brownie points.
 "Mrs. Alexander, I read something about water around reactor cores giving off a blue light.
 Can you explain how that works?"
 I'd expected something stupid, but glowing water made me think of the vivid dreams.
 I listened as intently as I'd ever listened to anything, and did my best to follow all of the diagrams as Mrs. Alexander attempted to break a college-level concept down into something fairly average high-school students could follow.
 "So, in short, really it's a matter of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms attempting to shed the excess energy they've gained from the radioactive particles emitted from the core.
 The energized electrons give off radiation in the visible light spectrum during the process of dropping down to a lower energy state."
 Hmm, an interesting concept, but still not an explanation for how the water in my dream had given off a soft golden glow, one that had rippled with the movement of the water.

In Dostoyevski the Thinker, I discovered a passage written following the death of his first wife.
 Since I have the book with me, I pull into a turnout overlooking the Pacific, find the passage and reread it.
 "To love someone as oneself, in accordance with Christ's commandment, is impossible.
 The love of personality is binding on earth.
 The self stands in the way.
 Christ could do it, but Christ was an eternal ideal, toward which man strives and must strive, by the law of nature.
 Meanwhile, after the appearance of Christ, as the ideal of man in the flesh, it became as clear as day that the highest, the final development of personality must come to this: that the person should recognize and with the full force of his nature be convinced that the highest someone can make of his self is to annihilate this self, as it were‚Äîto give it totally to each and every one, individually and unselfishly.
 And this is the greatest happiness."
 The ocean is cornflower blue, like the sky above the Tia Juana River long ago.
 Far offshore, an oil rig appears to bob.

Would this ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù give her number to a ‚Äúbad boy?‚Äù The ploy worked and somehow Lisa agreed to let me call her.
 Lisa had been dating a guy for years and I knew of him.
 He had attended our high school and he was the quarterback of the football team (my polar opposite).
 She had only come to the club the night I met her because she was angry with her boyfriend because he choose to spend Valentine‚Äôs Day with his brother playing basketball (take notes boys).
 She had called a friend who told her she could get her into this bar because she knew the bartender and they were both under legal drinking age.
 Lisa was 20.
 She was a ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù and hadn‚Äôt ever done anything like that.
 She had no intention of breaking up with her boyfriend.
 I looked her square in her beautiful blue eyes and I told her flatly, ‚ÄúYou are going to fall so in love with me that you will not even remember this guy‚Äôs name!‚Äù We were married three years later.

It was the kind of thing that Mom was always trying to capture with her camera, but which never seemed to turn out quite as good as the real thing.
 The sunset wasn't what captured my interest though, it was the greenery.
 Mom's room looked out to the west, the gorgeous side that reminded me of the place and people that would always be home.
 Mom carting me off to the middle of nowhere wasn't going to change that.

Production dropped precipitously as frantic efforts were made to reverse economic decline by radical measures.
 Although these events were closely observed and strongly assisted by top international experts, the world lacked both the conceptual knowledge and the practical experience needed to guide these nations through their crisis.
 At the invitation of the Soviet Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Commission's next meeting, in November 1990, was held in Moscow: it would examine the challenges facing the USSR during the shift to democracy and a civilian market economy, and identify steps to improve the food supply, speed military conversion and ease the economic transition.
 The immediate euphoria over the rapid reduction in tensions between East and West freed public attention to focus on other pressing problems and generated great expectations that a 'peace dividend' would usher in a period of rapid economic progress for developing countries.
 Yet, despite a remarkable one-third reduction in worldwide defence spending from peak levels in the 1980s, foreign aid budgets continued to shrink.
 This prompted us to examine the potential benefits that could be derived from transferring or redirecting scientific, technological, educational and productive resources from military applications to support development and the environment.
 At the same time, increasing pressure was mounted by donors on aid-dependent developing countries to reduce their own defence spending, often with out consideration for the genuine security concerns of these countries.
 The need to improve mechanisms to protect all nations from external aggression has stimulated a rethinking of the competitive security paradigm which has governed relations between nations throughout the century, and the formulation of an alternative approach.
 The slow expansion of world trade and economic growth in developing countries during this period, attributable to prolonged recession in industrialized nations and a drastic decline in demand from Eastern Europe, underlined the need for more effective and better-coordinated development strategies to address the problems of the world's one billion people who live in hunger and absolute poverty.
 Increasing the production and availability of food to meet the nutritional needs of a still rapidly expanding global population led us to propose steps to double food production in deficit regions.

But whatever the method, it is essential that this effort be combined with simultaneous implementation of other essential policies.
 3.Eliminate crop losses: In Russia and the other republics of the former USSR, highest priority in agriculture must be given to efforts that will increase the availability of food and reduce the huge crop losses and massive food imports.
 These losses vary by crop and region but average between 25 and 50 per cent of total field production for major crops.
 A reduction in crop losses could completely eliminate millions of tons of grain imports.
 The reasons for such enormous losses include poor quality of seeds and planting material, the lack of sufficient local storage capacity, in efficient and inappropriate equipment for planting, harvesting, storage and processing, poorly motivated farm workers and short age of labour at harvest time.
 Demonstration projects have proved that potato losses can be reduced from 35 per cent to under 5 per cent in one year.
 A viable solution requires concerted and coordinated activity by government, industry and agriculture at a time when each is operating in isolation from the others.
 The main elements of a viable plan to reduce losses for foodgrains, vegetables and potatoes have been proposed by a Dutch cooperative agri-business firm.
 The aim of the plan is to reduce food imports to zero and eliminate food shortages within three to five years.
 The plan requires acquisition of foreign production and storage technology, but depends only marginally on import of equipment, most of which can be manufactured in domestic defence facilities.

lture, the measures are to increase food availability, increase the capacity of local agriculture food production92m and0m food processing facilities92m as0m well as storage and processing equipment, which don‚Äôt require imports, to be used to enhance the production of food grains and vegetables. The aim of all of these92m measures0m is to substantially increase the availability of food worldwide. The growth in the production and export of small crop vegetables began in the 1960s following a92m reduction0m in the size of this industry and the subsequent expansion of92m the0m export and<sep>.

Even in such agriculturally diverse countries as the United States and India, it has been demonstrated that better management of micro-nutrients can raise productivity substantially ‚Äì in some intensively cultivated areas by as much as 50 to 100 per cent or more in a wide variety of crops ‚Äì without significant changes in the structure or method of cultivation.
 Greater attention is needed to conserving and applying organic sources of manure and raising nitrogen-fixing crops, as well as to the use of bio-fertilizers.
 Unlike the creation of new irrigated lands, the application of such environmentally sustainable field practices is neither very costly nor technology-intensive, and can be widely propagated through improvements in agricultural training and extension.
 Increasing exports
 Over the next six years, the agreements reached during the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations are expected to reduce the tariffs levied by the industrial nations on agricultural products by 37 per cent and on tropical food exports by 43 per cent.
 Developing countries will cut agricultural tariffs by an average of 24 per cent.
 In addition, North American and Western European countries have agreed to cut agricultural subsidies by one-third.
 Together these cuts are expected to result in a 20 per cent rise in exports of agricultural and processed foods by 2005.
 The share of developing countries in this increase has been estimated at $20 billion to $60 billion annually.
 Increased trade can act as a strong stimulus to the growth of agricultural, agro-industrial and rural employment, provided that these countries respond dynamically to the opportunity by raising productivity and strengthening rural infrastructure for storage, processing and distribution.

ping countries like the United States and India increase trade, they are expected to turn to environmentally sustainable92m field0m practices that can contribute to agricultural and rural92m development0m. In the United States, significant growth has been seen in the exports of all organic agricultural products, and in92m agricultural0m92m production0m in the European Union ‚Äì notably due to the increased use of organic pesticides and bio-fertilizers and the implementation of improved practices to manage pest and prevent disease,92m thanks0m to the use of compost. 4.

After reading about a drive from Big Sur into Monterrey, I go online and look up pictures of the two real people (to whom the book gives other names) on that drive, Kerouac and Neal Cassady.
 Both men were remarkably handsome, some of God‚Äôs finest art, I think.
 Then I remember a character from Ken Kesey‚Äôs Sometimes a Great Notion, and I realize that Kesey may have used Neal Cassady, a fellow of wild intellect and passion, and a legendary womanizer, as a prototype for his character Joe Ben.
 Only he revised, changed his life, and made Joe Ben a real hero.
 Remembering that Kesey and Cassady were friends, I look up some dates.
 Sure enough, they met while Kesey was writing that novel, two years before it came out.
 And no doubt he had read Kerouac's novels featuring Cassady, a.k.a.
 Dean Moriarty et al.
 In Sometimes a Great Notion, Joe Ben used to be, as a teen, so handsome and so enthralled by girls, he never could have stayed true to any one of them.
 But a motorcycle crash disfigured his perfect face.

back to the bald head he was accustomed to, and then92m,0m before he died, he became a true hero, and92m one0m of the greatest protagonists in the book. ................92m.0m.........92m.0m92m.0m....................................

‚ÄúKojas sounds like toe jazz, whatever that is.‚Äù I heard Emily laugh and Jason say, ‚ÄúBurn!‚Äù Kojas‚Äô eyes flamed but he formed a tight smile.
 ‚ÄúLet me inform you, Jazell, that you are outnumbered five to one?‚Äù Man, this guy is good.
 ‚ÄúUm, well we‚Ä¶are cooler than you,‚Äù I stumbled.
 ‚ÄúReally Jazell?‚Äù Emily hissed from behind me.
 I turned my head to her.
 ‚ÄúWell, you come up with something to top that and we‚Äôll see how well you do.‚Äù ‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôm good,‚Äù she said quickly.
 Kojas laughed again.
 Seriously, was this faery guy crazy or something?
 ‚ÄúYou are mistaken,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúI am cooler than you because I hold all the cards.‚Äù Then he turned to the army and yelled, ‚ÄúAttack!‚Äù

 ‚ÄúAny man who would hang out with a brute like Harruq must be a disturbed individual.‚Äù

He had no desire to hurt them, and less to be killed by them; but was unsure of how they could share the farm with them.
 Like the barn, the house was made of perfect cut stone that looked almost new; everything else had gone back to nature.
 Rodregas circled around to the back where the stone steps led to the cellar.
 He was sure that originally that there had had doors covering the entrance, but of course, they were long gone.
 Rodregas smelled what he would find well before he came around the corner.
 Next to the entrance was the corpse of a large bear which had recently been killed and partly eaten.
 It had been a magnificent creature, the largest of the local black bears that he had ever seen.
 Rodregas realized that it had been a Dire beast, drawn here by the safe magical energies.
 Next to the dead bear were the two Dire Cats.
 Rodregas had gone around the corner thinking they were in the cellar, but instead found himself no more than twenty feet from them.

Like ‚ÄúMary Had a Little Lamb.‚Äù Consciously so?
 BG:  	A children‚Äôs song?
 Shit.
 No.
 It‚Äôs about being in bed with a new woman.
 It‚Äôs about that moment of intimacy after you‚Äôve spent each other, that time when you‚Äôre running your fingers over each other‚Äôs bodies, asking about little nooks and crannies, scars and tattoos.
 I said this to a woman‚Äîthe ‚Äúwhite swan woman‚Äù in the song‚Äîafter our first intercourse.
 I said to her, ‚ÄúIf you push your belly button‚Ä¶‚Äù and she laughed long and hard.
 It became code between us, code for post-coital pleasures.
 By the way, the song makes reference to an actual quote.

‚ÄúIt is a beautiful blade,‚Äù Harruq said, examining the elven weapon that had belonged to Ahrqur.
 They were killing the final hour before dark.
 Then they would hoist the wrapped body onto Harruq‚Äôs shoulder and sneak out of town.
 Qurrah sat meditating in a corner while Harruq yammered to himself.
 The blade was in one hand, the decorative scabbard in the other.
 ‚ÄúHe was a skilled swordsman,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúHe was also arrogant.
 I would expect such a blade from one like him.‚Äù

I kept seeing Jason's knives fly off into the woods, or sink into the ground, instead of hitting their mark.
 ‚ÄúAnd now half-ling,‚Äù it whispered with joy, ‚Äúyou die.‚Äù It lunged up at me.
 I had a sudden feeling inside and I stabbed at the creature.
 It tried to change forms to avoid the knife's path but somehow my knife stabbed it anyway.
 It withered and then went still.
 I gasped as the body fell to the ground and even some of the creatures, around stopped.
 They murmured among each other, ‚ÄúShe killed a syphon!
 She killed one of us.‚Äù So the awful creatures were called syphons?
 What did they want?

And all those small bodies he left for his brother to mutilate?
 What was it his swords were accomplishing?
 Every action, every kill, seemed to confirm the words of his brother.
 He was a killer and nothing more.
 His legacy would be one of death and emptiness.
 The ghosts of the village clung to his back and neck.
 His choice was made.
 When he looked to the stars, he saw Aurelia‚Äôs face among them.
 He tried not to think of what she‚Äôd say if she knew what he had done.

Jasmin just looked like she'd rather be anywhere than on babysitting duty.
 Rachel had explained that Alec didn't want us delicate, fragile girls traveling alone, so he'd assigned us bodyguards, who happened to also be female and delicate-looking, but who weren't nearly as fragile.
 Also, it turned out we weren't going to Sanctuary, or St. George, or even anywhere in Utah, a fact I didn't realize until we'd been on the road for twenty minutes.
 "Oh, Adri, don't be silly.
 You can't do real shopping in Sanctuary.
 Besides, Alec wouldn't have let the four of us go alone if we'd been planning on staying so close to Brandon's territory.
 Vegas was definitely the best option given the time restrictions we're under."
 I'd settled in for a long trip, only to realize as we crossed the state line that Jasmin was positively shattering the speed limit.
 I managed to limit myself to a single gulp, when I saw just how fast she was going, but everyone else was so relaxed that I finally managed to unclench my fists and join back in the conversation.
 It helped that the Mercedes was so smooth, and that I knew Jasmin had reflexes and reaction time that would've made any Indy racer insanely jealous.

We nearly died because it was the right thing to do to rescue the Nymphs, especially with the children being part of the caravan.‚Äù Rodregas added in a growl, ‚ÄúThere were probably Dire steeds as well.‚Äù ‚ÄúBy the Infernal Daemons, I might be as strong as a Celestial Lion, but we are going to get chopped to little pieces until we have decent armor and weapons.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut why would they keep the armor?‚Äù growled Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúThese people do not seem to be warriors.
 What good would it do them?‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan tossed his wild black mane of hair and his eyes lighted with rage.
 Rodregas suddenly realized that he better not feed the Hellborn‚Äôs rage.
 Those with Infernal blood were known for their berserker rages.
 They seldom survived the rampages, but were nearly unstoppable when they fell into one.
 Rodregas breathed deeply, trying to lower his own anger and frustration.
 Jordaan stepped outside the room Rodregas had been staying in and into the small clearing that was the center of the Nymph Dwello, the tent like structure that they used for houses.
 ‚ÄúGentleman, please,‚Äù said Jordaan.
 ‚ÄúYou must have understood that this village took a great risk in taking you, and those you rescued, in.

He stared at the problem in the largest cell.
 There, sprawled on the floor, were the two female Dire Cats that had been used to trap the Celestial lion.
 Rodregas swore that as soon as he looked at the cats, they were already looking at him straight in the eye.
 The large green eyes demanded something of him even as the animals lay in apparent complete relaxation, sprawled on the stone floor.
 He had to let them out, but how was he going to do that?
 If he simply opened the door, they might tear him apart.
 Rodregas thought the cats may also attack the guard at the front gate on their way out.
 He looked around and realized that the other side of the hall had a door that opened in the same direction as the door leading to the cage.
 He opened it up and thought that if he opened the Dire Cats‚Äô door, he could block them from this direction, while keeping himself safe behind the two doors.
 He knew the guards at the gate would be incredibly curious about what he had been doing, but they would not actually do anything to challenge the man they thought was the Sorcerer Ravenhurr.

e decided to open the front door and allow them to enter through the back door. When he did, the front door would still be open as long as the cage was inside.

His arms and legs bulged with muscle.
 He flexed his arm and stared at the growth that traveled all the way up to his neck.
 He felt within himself a lifewell of energy, one infinitely deep.

 ‚ÄúYou are the protector of my disciple.

 He slid his two swords out from their sheaths, stunned by the ease in which he moved them.

I took the proffered test and made my unsteady way back to my desk.
 The class passed in a blur as I made a half-hearted attempt to focus on the questions and remember all kinds of facts about photosynthesis that I'd known just a few days before.
 It was useless.
 The separate pieces of information skittered about on the edge of my memory without ever becoming tangible enough to relate to the answer I needed.
 By the time class ended, I'd almost completely shut down.
 I registered the whispers as I made my way to English.
 I normally would've been mad, or possibly embarrassed, but it was like my feelings were wrapped in layers of cotton candy.
 If I really pushed, I could faintly feel the hard edges, but there were so many layers shrouding them.
 I just couldn't seem to muster up enough concentration to care.

It was depressing to think that I probably had one less thing to look forward to.
 Looking at the clock, I saw that I was a bit behind schedule.
 The bus would be here in about ten minutes, and Britney was supposed to arrive just a tad before that.
 It was sad, but I didn't trust her anymore, so I'd probably take the bus if she didn't show up before it did.
 I just couldn't risk her leaving me here without a ride.
 She'd been way weirded out after my collapse.
 I wasn't sure even the promise of Brandon's continued presence would be enough to convince her to come through on her word.

Mainland China had become communist and was therefore excluded from the power structure.
 India and the other colonies had not yet gained their freedom.
 In recognition of the mutual suspicions between Russia and the Western powers, the rule of unanimity usually adopted by political conferences was applied to decisions made by the five major powers that became the permanent members of the Security Council.
 The rest of the world was poorly represented.
 Only 51 nations ‚Äì including only two African states, two East Asian nations and three Soviet republics ‚Äì out of the current total of 184 UN members were present at its founding.
 This structure is based on political realities that no longer hold true.
 As the limitations of the League led to renewed conflagration two decades later, so the arrangements underlying the establishment of the UN contained within them the seeds of the confrontation between the superpowers and the Cold War.
 The present international system of governance is as far from being truly representative and ‚Äòdemocratic‚Äô as many erstwhile authoritarian governments that incorporated the popular adjective in the names of their parties or states.
 The UN Charter assigns primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security to the Security Council of 15 members, of whom five are permanent members with veto power over all matters.
 In no other constitution or organization founded on democratic principles is it accepted that a few members may thus invalidate the decisions of the majority.

s of the92m Security0m Council are not elected representatives, whatever their powers, are elected92m to0m office. Five92m permanent0m members of the Security Council are elected representatives and any decision by the 15 members of the Council, in respect of policy or measures taken by the Security Council or any92m UN0m agency, is subject to their review and approval.<eop> All UN members have absolute veto power over the validity of the decisions of the92m five0m permanent members of the Council and the Security Council has the right to revoke the decisions of any member.

Was Rodregas really that strong?
 Or was the bed just lighter than it looked?
 He went back over to the trunk and lifted it up; it to went up too easily and felt strangely light.
 Next he went over the dresser.
 Rodregas had known that the physical essence of the celestial lion was in his body and that all of his physical attributes would be improved, but the strength of the Immortalist was not common knowledge; you just heard that they were long lived and never got sick.
 They used magic against their foes not swords, and they seldom got involved in physical struggles.
 Of course Rodregas had known that in The Immortal Guard of the Guild the most loyal and powerful of their officers were given enhanced bodies, but he thought their power lay in their magical sigils.
 His new body was very large and very muscular, and much stronger than he would have guessed.
 Rodregas lifted his right arm and curled it into a tight muscle.
 He felt the biceps with his free hand.

I was just numb enough still to think about such things without immediately collapsing.
 Even so, I felt a pang of dizziness as my mind warned me I'd pushed it too far today.
 I found myself in the kitchen, nearly finished making enchiladas with only vague ideas of why I'd started pulling ingredients out of the fridge.
 I wasn't hungry.
 I knew I should eat something, but that hardly merited putting together anything more complicated than a sandwich.
 What was I trying to accomplish?
 I slowly put the pan in the oven as I admitted to myself that even after more than two days, the odds were better than even that I'd be eating alone, that most of the food would go into the fridge untouched.
 My class work, neglected as it had been all day, really deserved my attention, but I didn't have the heart to pull it out.
 I knew I wouldn't find any kind of refuge there.
 Instead, I pulled out a pencil and a sheet of paper from my notebook, and started sketching.

I threw both hands in front of me, palms out, and forced the largest mass I could in response.
 Chevelle flicked his wrist and the flame dodged up and angled back toward me.
 I shook my hands frantically, spitting sharp bullets of heat at it, hoping to break it up.
 But he pulled his hands apart and the thing split, each side curving toward me; there were two now, closing in fast.
 I leapt forward just as they collided where I‚Äôd been standing and lost my footing while I watched the fireworks behind me.
 Spinning into a tumble to keep from landing flat on my face, I rolled to my feet, still thrilling from the fire play.
 From magic.
 I let out a breathless laugh and Chevelle joined in, though in all fairness, he might have merely been amused by my fall.
 We spent the next several hours there in the meadow, sculpting my craft.
 The exercises grew increasingly more difficult, but it seemed Chevelle was only toying with me.

 "Those of us who don't require normal amounts of sleep have all been up for quite some time, with the exception of Master Alec, who remained abed for an uncharacteristic length of time, but the rest of the house is just now waking.
 In fact I rather suspect you have just enough time to shower and eat before Mistress Rachel will be pounding on the door, as it were, in excitement for your upcoming trip into town."
 A groan escaped me despite my best efforts.

Possibly the greatest strength of the Yugoslav programme is that it was of necessity conceived by people within the country rather than by foreign experts, and depended entirely on domestic resources and capabilities for its accomplishment, rather than on pleas for foreign assistance.
 Self-reliance released the creativity, generated the determination and mobilized all available resources to make the transition successful.
 It is too early to predict the eventual outcome in Yugoslavia, subject as it is to extraordinary external constraints on public policy.
 However, the initial evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that alternative approaches can and must be fashioned which are more comprehensive in scope, more balanced in implementation, more pragmatic in conception and less influenced by extreme ideological viewpoints.
 It is likely that further study of the Yugoslav model will reveal important applications not only for countries suffering from hyperinflation or the effects of radical transition, but for those carrying out more modest programmes fo economic reform.
 Recommendations for Accelerating Transition in the East
 Conditions within the 25 nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia vary significantly enough to limit the scope for broad generalizations on strategy beyond the statement of principles presented in this chapter.
 However, there are a number of specific recommendations applicable to all or most of these countries that can be applied to accelerate the pace and ease the pain of transition.
 1.Generate consensus for the transition programme: The transition should be an expression of the will of the society for change and it should help generate greater unity and harmony within the society.
 Further attempts to put through any macro-economic reform package will meet with strong political and social resistance unless a national consensus on the strategy is arrived at beforehand.

Every time I nodded off, I awoke a few minutes later, my mind reaching for something that wasn't there, only to snap back as it didn't find what it was looking for.
 Each time the backlash woke me up, I tried to figure out what was going on, but I didn't succeed until nearly morning.
 I'd been trying to find the vivid dreams again.
 I'd finally stopped thinking about them, finally stopped yearning for them every night, only to have my stupid subconscious somehow mix them up with real life.
 That was really the thing that was the most unnerving.
 I'd only ever unconsciously drawn real places.
 To draw a pretend place was surprisingly unsettling, but I almost couldn't blame whatever part of me had gotten confused.
 The dreams were so clear and sharp they sometimes seemed more real than the rest of my life.
 By the time I finally realized what was keeping me from getting real sleep it was too late to worry about trying to get anymore rest.

What more can we ask of art, right?
 Later, when I met him, I talked to him about this and he was, well, flattered, I guess, and he talked about how Guthrie and Leadbelly were like that for him.
 All these memories collide in my head to form a capharnaum around what I want to know more concretely: how did Bob Dylan become important to me?
 And the process must have been gradual, an accretion, Bob Dylan never became, for me, what James Joyce was for Richard Ellmann, or to use a less pretentious comparison, what hamburgers were for Wimpy.
 A centering object, a holy thing.
 But he became a dream-figure, a part of my unconscious, as I understand the term.

And it did work for several minutes.
 Rodregas simply kept running in a circle around Geriodon just outside the range of his mace.
 He dug into the sand with his feet and he ran, and kept running.
 Minutes went by before Geriodon‚Äôs own spin move went a little too fast as he tired.
 Then Rodregas simply threw himself into the man and wrestled him to the ground.
 Even as Rodregas carefully ripped Geriodon‚Äôs helmet off the squire kept fighting.
 This man was a true fighter and Rodregas wished that he could also become a knight, but there could be only one winner today.
 Rodregas‚Äô fist stopped the squire‚Äôs struggles.
 He looked around and to his alarm he saw the last remaining squire running toward the hall with the shield.
 It was generally understood that you did not try to claim the shield until the last opponent was down.

Rodregas nodded, his thoughts swirling as he realized that he could use the celebration to his benefit.
 Without looking at the captain he walked toward the stairway, and the captain followed close behind him.
 At the door Rodregas took a deep breath and said, ‚ÄúCaptain, that ceremony did not go smoothly, but the gods once again proved to favor me, and I wish to be generous with the birthday ceremony.
 Tell the purser to pay everyone an extra month‚Äôs wages today and give everyone a week off to spend as they wish.
 Make sure you tell Purser Stevents to be generous.
 I want all staff rewarded, even the kitchen drudges.‚Äù He finished, hoping it did not sound as halting and made up as he knew it to be.
 ‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù replied Captain Poir, his expression going from a guarded concern to enthusiasm.
 He seemed reassured when Rodregas mentioned Stevents.
 He must have thought either Ravenhurr had been a bit damaged by the ritual or that the young man whose body he now inhabited might still be alive and faking it, obviously the young man would not know about Stevents.
 It must not have occurred to him that his senior sergeant, who had burned in the end, might now inhabit the body.

Today, more than 1.1 billion people in developing countries, constituting 58 per cent of the economically active population, work in agriculture.
 The decline in proportion of the workforce in this sector must necessarily be gradual.
 An employment strategy which generates a large number of new jobs in the non-farm rural sector could contribute substantially to diversification of rural employment opportunities.
 A similar strategy has proved highly effective as an engine for growth in a number of East Asian countries, which employed crop-intensive and labour-intensive technologies to achieve increasing levels of employment and productivity in agriculture.
 Empirical evidence from these countries confirms that wherever agriculture becomes prosperous, labour becomes scarce.
 Between 1952 and 1968, land reform in Taiwan increased the number of cultivators five-fold, leading to dramatic increases in output and productivity, a shift from foodgrains to higher value-added fruit and vegetable crops, and the creation of more than 100,000 jobs in post-harvest and processing activities.
 These changes in employment led to enhanced rural incomes and purchasing power, growing domestic demand for goods and services, including manufactured goods, and further job growth.
 Land reform in South Korea during the early 1950s increased the number of owner cultivators from 50 per cent to 90 per cent and led to a 4.7 per cent annual growth in labour productivity per hectare over a 15-year period.
 Then, as agricultural technology improved and industrialization gained momentum, the proportion of South Korea‚Äôs workforce engaged in agriculture fell from 55 per cent to under 16 per cent over the following three decades.
 Thailand, which has had the fastest growth of the East Asian economies in recent years and still employs 70 per cent of its workforce in agriculture, has also attained high rates of production and employment in the rural sector through diversification in agriculture from traditional cultivation of rice and rubber to high-value crops and agro-based industries.

in productivity has led to an increase in the number of92m jobs0m. In recognition of the importance of agriculture to agriculture, fisheries, fisheries, tourism, fisheries, forestry,92m mining0m, and agriculture industries in Brunei, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Taiwan, recent development in the rural sector92m has0m underscored the importance of agriculture. In these countries, agriculture has contributed to the development of advanced science and technology in agriculture92m,0m increasing levels of employment, expansion of the92m number0m of farmers, and raising the quality of agriculture.<eop><eod>

They did not try to locate their dead among the hundreds of other rotting bodies.
 Instead, a few elves flew low and scattered firestones, small pebbles that burst into flame upon landing.
 Grass and bodies ignited, and the battlefield rapidly swelled into a giant funeral pyre.

 Everywhere he looked, he saw embers and corpses.

The continued build-up of nuclear arsenals was an attempt by the superpowers to maintain parity or superiority over each other as a deterrent against being attacked.
 Although the nuclear powers may argue that their arsenals have protected them from any such danger, there is little rationality in a strategy that compelled adversaries continuously to take steps to offset each other‚Äôs measures, without either party actually achieving greater real security.
 In addition, this strategy was pursued at the cost of increasing insecurity to other nations.
 The acquisition of nuclear weapons generates a ripple effect and acts as a powerful force for proliferation.
 The arms build-up has been reversed, but at least 40,000 nuclear weapons are still in stockpiles with a combined explosive force at least 1,000 times greater than all the firepower used in all the wars since the introduction of gunpowder six hundred years ago.
 START-I and START-II will bring down the number of warheads of the United States and the former Soviet Union by 90 per cent from a combined 55,500 total to 6,500 over a ten-year period.
 But this reduction could, in fact, be achieved within months rather than years by deactivating delivery systems and separating their warheads, which could then be stored under multilateral control.
 Nor do these agreements, long overdue and greatly welcome, remove the fundamental dangers and questionable legitimacy of these weapons.
 Even without a decision to abandon completely their use under any circumstances, a further drastic reduction to somewhere between 20 and 200 warheads is more than sufficient to meet any security need.
 Immediate steps can, and should, be taken to negotiate reductions to this minimum level.

 Many changes, challenges and compromises in our marriage would soon follow.
 Many difficult times required me to recall the moment I first saw Lisa.
 A second son, Bryce, was added to our family two years later.
 I have tried to explain to my friends with no children yet that having children changes everything suddenly.
 Every day, sometimes every second, delivers a new challenge.

‚ÄúCalm yourself,‚Äù Qurrah whispered to his brother as the two marched in front of the guards toward the main streets.
 ‚ÄúTrying,‚Äù Harruq whispered back.
 They marched at sword point.
 Onlookers cackled as they passed, figuring the two were thieves or vagrants caught brawling.
 Their orcish features lent them no kindness, and a few children even threw rocks until the guards shooed them away.
 The whole while Harruq burned with shame and rage.
 They reached the western gate, which remained open during the day.
 Without ceremony, they were kicked through, both falling to the dirt and scraping their knees.

The security, stability, productivity, growth and sustainability of society are determined by its values.
 This report calls upon nations and the international community to make a conscious shift to values that can generate greater domestic and international security, higher rates of sustainable growth, and more equitable distribution of benefits for all.
 The insistence on immediate abolition of war, eradication of poverty, democratic human rights and full employment expresses a commitment to the pre-eminent values of human life, social and economic as well as political freedom, and the development of the full potential of the individual.
 The achievement of these high human values also requires the achievement of a large number of physical, organizational, social and psychological values: higher productivity, better quality, more efficient utilization of resources, faster speed, more systematic functioning, improved coordination and cooperation, punctuality, cleanliness, open-mindedness, tolerance, harmony and a host of other values essential for high achievement in any field.
 Therefore, we have stressed repeatedly the importance of the value of integration in the formulation of strategies, of maximum utilization of human and social as well as material and technological resources, of greater speed and organization, and other values.
 Values are a powerful instrument to spur development.
 They are goals or standards that set the direction and mobilize the collective cultural energies of the society for great accomplishment.
 They prompt us to strive for the maximum that is conceivable, rather than the mini mum that is achievable.
 Values form the basis for the tremendous developmental achievements of the past two hundred years, such as the Japanese commitment to teamwork and consensus, the American devotion to enterprise and innovation, the German dedication to quality, and the Dutch commitment to partnership with other people, rather than exploitation.
 Development is retarded by the slow pace at which new values are acquired, which normally requires a change of generation.

 "You don't want me to be nice to you?"

 "It just does."

Jim ‚Äì There doesn‚Äôt need to be a lot of dwarves, just one of them is worth like 3 midgets, pointed sticks or no pointed sticks.
 What they lack in quantity they make up in quality.
 I mean these guys are huge and muscular, at least from a midget‚Äôs perspective, and they have those pick-axes they use around the mine.
 The seven dwarves would win hands down.
 Liz ‚Äì you‚Äôre forgetting that the dwarves have just come home after a long day‚Äôs work in the mines.
 They‚Äôre exhausted, they‚Äôre not looking for a fight.
 They don‚Äôt have a prayer of taking on all 10 of the midgets.
 The dwarves might be angry about Snow White being kidnapped, but that doesn‚Äôt compare to even to the daily life of a midget.
 Midgets have all the pent up rage of being so different from the rest of humanity and condemned to circus life to fuel their fire in the midst of battle.
 The midgets could take the seven dwarves unarmed and surprised.

‚ÄúNo elf hired us, and no gold was put in our pockets.‚Äù
 The flaming whip appeared, charring grass as it touched the ground.
 ‚ÄúThen what do you want with me?‚Äù the man shrieked.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see,‚Äù Harruq whispered into his ear before backing away.
 The eyes of the nobleman grew wider, and panic gripped him entirely.
 ‚ÄúNo, no you can‚Äôt.

It was a losing argument, but I hated being cooped up in bed all the time, and it was the only argument I had.
 Alec paused for a second to look down at the long, thick bandage wrapped around his middle.
 The gash of white cutting across his darkly tanned skin was uncomfortably similar to what I imagined his wound must have looked like just after Brandon had inflicted it.
 He sighed, but there wasn't any real frustration to the sound.
 "Our cases are hardly comparable.
 You know I heal more quickly than you do."
 An upraised finger cut me off before I could latch onto my last remaining point.
 "The fact that your injury was less severe is really quite immaterial.
 Even the fact that shape shifter-inflicted wounds don't heal as quickly as normal for me is really a small matter when compared to just how much blood you lost before we got the bleeding staunched."
 And there was the real rub.

It flared again and Chevelle squeezed my hands; I had to be able to do this.
 I focused hard on the base of the flame as it wavered and then fell back toward the hem, where it finally choked off.
 I glanced up at Chevelle.
 He looked pleased.
 ‚ÄúAgain,‚Äù he said as he stepped back and released my hands.
 The meadow seemed to open as a circle of fire grew in front of me.
 I tried to see past it, through the flames to Chevelle, and then it was gone.
 He was further back now, raising his right hand so a stream of fire followed it, arcing in my direction.
 I was afraid I wouldn‚Äôt be able to extinguish it before it hit me.
 My feet were frozen in place.

I sometimes felt I should have outgrown the need to talk to Mom when things were tough, but I couldn't deny that it felt like a big weight had been lifted off me as I walked through the door.
 "I'm home, Mom.
 How did your latest shoot..." Whatever I'd been about to say evaporated off of my tongue as I entered the living room and saw Mom curled up on the couch with bloodshot eyes.
 Mom had always been the strong one.
 I still more or less belonged in some kind of padded room.
 Mom had simply accepted events and done her best to hold our life together so there'd be something for me to come back to.
 "What happened?"
 I wanted to comfort her like I used to do with Cindi, but I suddenly realized I didn't know how.
 Parents weren't supposed to need reassuring.
 If they did, they were supposed to work it out between each other.

 No part of me wanted to surrender to my mother‚Äôs killers, but I could not make Chevelle suffer more than he already had.
 My hands trembled and I tightened them into fists.
 He was my watcher; he must have felt he needed to fulfill his duties, to keep his honor.
 He would finish our journey and return me to the village.
 ‚ÄúFreya.‚Äù He said my name as if it were tearing at him and my chest ached.

Yet, even where food supplies are adequate, absence of opportunities for gainful employment to generate the purchasing power needed to buy food can result in hunger.
 Lack of food and employment are the basis for the poverty that still afflicts one-fifth of humankind.
 When it comes to food there can be no justification or excuse ‚Äì everyone must have enough to eat, and can have enough.
 A world dedicated to upholding the political rights and property rights of nations and individuals cannot fail to recognize and enforce the most fundamental of all human rights ‚Äì the right to live.
 Contrary to the fears raised in earlier centuries and revived in recent decades, today the world does possess the capacity to feed everyone, even at current levels of food production ‚Äì subject as it is to disincentives, quotas, restrictions and trade barriers that food surplus countries impose to curtail food production, while other nations remain in perpetual deficit.
 In spite of a doubling of population in the developing countries since 1960, their average food supplies have increased from 1950 calories to 2475 calories per capita per day, or from an average of 90 per cent to 107 per cent of the minimum caloric requirement.
 During the past 12 years alone, per capita food production in developing countries has risen by 15 per cent.
 Overall, the proportion of people in developing countries suffering from hunger and mal nutrition has dropped dramatically both in relative and absolute terms, from 941 million people constituting 36 per cent of the population of these nations in 1970 to 781 million constituting less than 20 per cent of the population in 1990.
 Current projections indicate that the growth rate in world agricultural output will continue to exceed population growth over the next two decades.
 By 2010, food grain production is expected to reach four times the level in 1960.

e of92m food0m production is expected to remain steady, and employment is also expected to increase. Both governments and the world have the capacity to provide the poor with services and goods, which will contribute to the availability of food as the rest of the world expands. In the wake of the post-war reforms of the political and economic92m system0m, and the rapid growth of the population and rapid development of food production infrastructure in the92m developing0m world, the decline92m of0m hunger and mal nutrition remains92m the0m most likely outcome

I spent the time wondering if I should try to make small talk; the gorgeous girl spent it staring out the window.
 The secretary took in the two of us, frowned almost imperceptibly at the length of the shorts and then signed a form for the other girl.
 Determined to at least try and make friends, I started to smile as she turned towards me on her way out, but the expression died as soon as I met her flat green eyes.
 My heart immediately started to race, but she was already gone, moving with grace and confidence out of the suddenly too-small office.
 I'd expected some degree of cliquishness from such a small-town, but this was bad.
 I'd never seen her before, so there wasn't any way it could be some kind of misunderstanding.
 The secretary smoothed her blouse down over an ample stomach and smiled at me.
 I told myself I was just imagining that the smile never reached her eyes.
 She seemed to know who I was, and after identifying herself as Mrs. Pendely, proceeded to quiz me about which classes I'd been in at my last school.
 She stumbled a bit when I told her I hadn't enrolled in classes before moving.

Rodregas had known that the physical essence of the celestial lion was in his body and that all of his physical attributes would be improved, but the strength of the Immortalist was not common knowledge; you just heard that they were long lived and never got sick.
 They used magic against their foes not swords, and they seldom got involved in physical struggles.
 Of course Rodregas had known that in The Immortal Guard of the Guild the most loyal and powerful of their officers were given enhanced bodies, but he thought their power lay in their magical sigils.
 His new body was very large and very muscular, and much stronger than he would have guessed.
 Rodregas lifted his right arm and curled it into a tight muscle.
 He felt the biceps with his free hand.
 The texture under the skin felt like bundles of large, powerful cables.
 He felt his face break into a smile; he had seen this face smile when it had been a prisoner.
 The smile the prisoner had worn was a very open charming smile.
 The smile he felt on his face now had little resemblance to the one he remembered seeing, though without looking in the mirror he had no way of knowing for sure.

Rachel and Britney were both in their accustomed places, Rachel studying away as always, and Britney making some weak efforts to do likewise.
 Two of the other three, a boy and a girl I recognized from second hour, but whose names I couldn't even begin to remember, were already packing their books into a pair of book bags, one of which was a fairly utilitarian item, the other of which probably cost as much as my whole wardrobe.
 I couldn't place the last boy for all that he looked really familiar.
 He had incredibly dark skin and features with a slight Middle Eastern cast.
 When he shifted in his seat, I realized he was built like a football player.
 Not like a lineman, but like a running back, or maybe a quarterback.
 He wasn't as big as Brandon, or even as Alec, but he was obviously well muscled, and he moved with an echo of their grace.
 None of which helped me figure out where I'd seen him before.
 He wasn't a regular at the tutor lab, and didn't have the hectic, desperate look of someone cramming for a test.
 Instead he looked completely at ease sitting in one of the no-man's-land tables with a pair of books open in front of him.

I sincerely hoped not, but I'd rather not have them right now than see the disdain he'd displayed earlier in the day.
 ** The next morning played out essentially the same as the day before.
 I awoke to an empty house, and then hurried to get ready and down to the bus stop so I wouldn't be stranded if nobody else showed up to give me a ride into school.
 Brandon smiled as he pulled up and found me patiently waiting for the school bus.
 "One of these days you're going to go ahead and wait for me at your house, and then I'll know you finally trust me."
 I didn't feel much like playful banter, but I marshaled a semi-convincing smile and gave it my best go.
 "Oh, I trust you, I just know that you've got more important things to worry about.
 One of these times you'll either forget to come get me, or you'll forget to tell me you're not coming by anymore."
 Brandon let the silence build for several seconds.
 "I'd try and convince you I'm not going to do any of that to you, but I suspect that's just going to take time."

I know you92m,0m" he assured me. "You trust me, Brandon, because you trust me, and don't want anyone else92m to0m think that you've earned it." "I know you."

The cloud dissipated.
 Before him, standing with his arms crossed, waited Velixar.
 Qurrah stunned his brother by falling to one knee and bowing his head.
 ‚ÄúGreetings, master,‚Äù Qurrah said.

 Delighted, Velixar grinned as he surveyed the tall, muscular half-orc.
 As with Qurrah, he saw the untapped potential, incredible strength, and skill waiting for a purpose to harness it.
 The subtle shift of Velixar‚Äôs features slowed as he approached.
