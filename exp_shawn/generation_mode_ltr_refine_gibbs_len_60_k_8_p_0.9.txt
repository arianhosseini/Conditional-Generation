“Ruby, please take Frey back to the house.” Chevelle was standing behind us.
 I was too exhausted to jump, but Ruby merely glanced back at him, not at all surprised he was there.
 Her face crinkled.
 “Didn’t go well?” He didn’t respond but was obviously frustrated.
 I couldn’t tell if it was with Ruby or whatever hadn’t gone well.
 Or the idiotic offspring of his parent’s murderer who tried to seduce him in a drunken stupor.
 It didn’t matter, I was being removed again.
 Ruby rambled about all of the difficulties of and uses for venom on our way back.
 She’d gotten so involved in her stories I thought she must have forgotten I was there.
 Her last words confirmed it.

“Huh?” “Time to go.” There was anger in his voice.
 I didn’t know what I had done, but I stood obediently.
 Chevelle pulled me away from Steed.
 “I’ll take her,” Ruby offered.
 “No.
 I’ll do it myself.” A lot of anger.
 “We’ll both go,” she pushed, forcing a polite tone.
 The rest of the group was quiet, watching us, and Ruby eyed Steed as we turned and headed toward the house.
 As soon as we were out of earshot, though I was still being dragged by the arm, I asked Chevelle, “Did something happen with the twins?” Ruby laughed.
 We both stared at her.

“No,” she said a little more clearly.
 “We have to wait and see what happens.
 Plus, we can’t just randomly attack them.” I didn’t really care.
 The song was repeating itself in my head, like a taunt.
 Without thinking, I aimed and shot the nearest dwarf.
 As soon as he went down, the whole camp was facing our direction.
 I was standing up now where everyone could see me.
 There was no point in hiding anymore.
 Emily stayed hidden behind the tree, and I could feel her glare trying to burn me into ashes.
 “You’ll wish you never shot one of his loyal servants.” A dwarf seemed to laugh at me.

He pulled her visor down.
 She used the mirror to wipe the tears and kohl smudges from her face.

Rodregas then said, “I agree we are just starting to figure out that there is something big going on.
 I can’t believe even the Immortalists would be crazy enough to go up against both the Celestial Gods and the Daemon Lordsof the Infernal though.” Imeralda nodded and said, “What price is so high as to be even better than God hood?” The three sat silent for a few minutes soaking in that question.
 Rodregas looked at Imeralda and asked, “Well, we can’t answer that today, but how did you break Van’dret’s spell?” Imeralda nodded and with a smile said, “I always hoped that if I had to take on a sorcerer it would be in the Forest where I would have an edge, but no, it had to be in a hallway!
 I knew my regular spells; he would counter without a problem.
 So I had to work around the spell.

Vines shot from the earth and wrapped around Harruq’s arms and legs.
 Down he went.
 Aurelia gave him no chance to recover.
 She raised her outstretched hand higher.
 More and more vines appeared, covering the half-orc’s arms and legs with green.
 They lifted him into the air, his boots dangling two feet above the ground.
 Harruq bellowed like a bull caught in a cage.
 He jerked against his restraints but they held firm.
 Aurelia calmly walked over, raised her staff, and tapped him on the chest.
 “Three,” she said.

Or do you prefer open and honest?
 Liz – Open and honest, it’s easier and more helpful that way.
 Art – Are you sure?
 Because given some time I can actually sound like I have a clue what I’m talking about.
 It’s not as useful per-say, but it sounds a lot better if you ever decide that you need a quote for a newspaper advertisement.
 You could have a picture of a handsome male model smiling and giving a thumbs-up sign with the line ‘Art says: this stuff is terrifatastic!’
 Liz – I’m sure.
 I need some feedback on my work, and mother isn’t saying anything but ‘mmmmm hmmmm, I like that’ and ‘no no no no, that would never sell Darling.’  So far my mother is the only person who I’ve talked to about it, and she only thinks about my work in a monetary fashion.

It was obvious he saw my anxiety, but I couldn’t be sure he wasn’t enjoying it.
 He just remained sitting there.
 “What should I do?” A sly grin crossed his face and he rolled his hand out in front of him.
 “You are only limited by your imagination, Freya.” Great, so if I screwed up it was just a problem with my mind.
 I considered that, recalling what Steed had said about feeling it, thinking about what you wanted to happen.
 But what did I want to happen?
 I had to catch that line of thought before it spiraled out of control; I concentrated on finding something small.
 A tiny pebble lay on the ground at my feet.
 I focused on it hard, willing it to rise.
 When nothing happened I looked for Chevelle’s reaction.

To save him.
 My boy.
 Brandon.
 I set an appointment with the arresting officers.
 I arrived at the police station with Brandon and we were escorted to an interview room.
 We were sitting in the police station in a county that is known for being tough on drugs and prosecuting everything to the fullest ability of the law.
 The door opened to a closet-size room with a table and four chairs.
 The walls were stark white and the room could barely accommodate the meager furnishings.
 Officer White and his Sergeant entered the room and sat opposite us.
 They were unrelenting that Brandon owed them a bust, no matter their mistake.

Black blots on parchment that made abstract shapes.
 “What do you see, Elfreda?” I knew what they wanted to hear—butterfly and flower species.
 But I was so resentful toward Fannie for putting me there, I usually saw a black blob of death consuming her.
 “A Monarch,” I’d say.
 She looked beyond me at the few inches of open floor, and I took the opportunity to bolt past her down the hall, straight out the door at full speed.
 I ran from the house, ignoring the paths; other elves would be no help to me.
 I kept running until I was certain she wasn’t coming, and then I collapsed at the edge of a meadow, breathless.
 I dropped my face into my hands, and might have wept if I’d not been so fueled by fear and adrenaline.

But there was no mention of that.
 Rick noticed her glazed eyes.
 "Are you tired?"
 "A little."
 "Found anything helpful?"
 "No.
 Well, maybe.

 They had no really provable success, anyway."

The shape twisted and stretched towards the sky, trying to touch it.
 Now that I really thought of it, it did look like a thorn.
 I dropped my bag and leaned my back against the statue, closing my eyes.
 I wondered what Igneeria would be like.
 Maybe the place would be pretty decent… “Jazell?” Emily’s voice scattered my thoughts and I opened my eyes to see her walking briskly towards me.
 She too had an empty bag slung over her shoulder.
 She dropped her bag next to mine and leaned against the statue.
 Nobody spoke for awhile.
 Finally Emily opened her mouth and said, “What are you thinking about?” “What?” The question had caught me by complete surprise.
 “What are you thinking about?” she repeated.

As they stepped out of the door the three of them quickly walked over to the forth wall.
 However, they could find nothing but the black stone of the wall; no door appeared under any fingertips.
 “Well… nothing here,” said Imeralda.
 “What did you find earlier?” she asked.
 “It is behind that door we have not opened up yet, but it smells of the Infernal Realm,” Doi’van said nodding over to the other exposed door.
 “What door?
 I see nothing but black stone.” she said.
 “What?” Rodregas exclaimed.
 “You don’t see that door?” Doi’van and he shared a look of confusion.

“Did you ever walk in your garden before that morning you walked into my garden?” “Of course.

 “That’s true.” “So you’ll keep trying.” “Yes.” “Now I’m sad.”  He met her eyes and then looked away.
 “I’m sorry.”  She hugged him, laying her head on his shoulder.

Unless she was out hiking somewhere, in which case it might be a day or two before she realized I was missing.
 There was nothing to do but walk.
 I waited a few minutes to give Britney time to get out of the lab, and then walked in and grabbed my things.
 The other kids were already clearing out.
 Nobody even looked up as I left.
 Luckily I'd worn sneakers rather than the exotic footwear most girls gravitated towards.
 If I'd been wearing anything else, I'd have been nursing blisters before I made it out of the parking lot.
 As it was, I quickly realized my little walk home was going to be twice as unpleasant as I'd expected.
 The school most definitely wasn't in the pretty, green part of the region.
 Every step kicked up a miniature cloud of fine, red dust that drifted into my lungs and slowly coated my clothes.

She turned his head to the side so he wouldn’t choke on his own blood, a strange gesture of kindness considering what was left of his manhood.
 “Glad to give you something to remember the town by,” she said.
 After a flirtatious flip of her hair, she started down the street.
 Aurelia froze, her blood as cold as when she had sensed the man in black.
 This time no magic could be blamed, and no sense of death.
 No, it was just the sight of Harruq, dressed in black armor and wielding ancient blades dripping with blood.
 Just the sight of him massacring an elven warrior.
 “Oh, Harruq,” she whispered.
 Then he saw her, and all time stopped.

I politely rebuffed the scavengers, ignored the haters, and carefully acknowledged the rest without giving them anything else to go on.
 It was a rather depressing exercise.
 By the time Mrs. Sorenson had fired a couple of ridiculously obscure questions at me, I found the good feelings I'd managed to carry away from the mayor's visit the night before had pretty much evaporated.

 Wuthering Heights wasn't ever going to be my favorite book, but Mr. Whethers had made the characters more real in the last few days and I was actually excited to see what he had in store next.
 Unfortunately, Mr. Whethers wasn't there.
 The substitute teacher sitting at his desk didn't even take roll; he just shut the door, told us to keep it down, and flipped open a magazine.
 While I was sitting at my desk wondering what to do with the next hour of my life, something I'd read in the physics book suddenly clicked.
 In a perfect world I would've been left in peace to finish reasoning out the answer.
 Instead, Britney leaned over and smiled.

I found myself startled again; I had not seen them sitting with the group, or anywhere else.
 For some reason, it was much more eerie than the little wiry man who blinked in and out of vision.
 One of the men spoke, his tone formal.
 “We will not demonstrate their full power at this time, in fear of shorting our forces a man for mere display.” I assumed he was probably joking.
 “As you can see, they can be frightening, however, without attack.” At that, the dogs walked into the circle.
 I had not seen them either, before they were approaching their masters.
 They came forward to snarl, one regarding Ruby and one Steed, and I could only be glad it wasn’t me as their muzzles pulled back and exposed a vicious set of teeth, complete with meat-tearing fangs.
 The hair rose on their backs and I was suddenly positive they were larger than Ruby.
 A horrific growl ripped from their chests in unison and I cringed.
 Then, at once, they settled back into relaxed seated positions as if they had never been angry.

Seth made a small, “Ow.” Every time she hit him.

 He glared at her and she threw it on the floor, “Now I’m done.” “So Jason,” I faced him and he looked up at me, “since Seth won’t tell me I’ll ask you.
 How did you guys find us?” “We followed a dwarf that was running here.
 If we didn’t get lost, we would have been here faster,” Jason’s face turned the color of his red Igneerian hair.
 “It’s okay, at least you answered me,” I shot Seth a look.
 “Well if it’s okay with you boys, we would like to get to bed.

But that is only the most direct initial impact of improved technology.
 Seen from a wider perspective and traced patiently along the course of its myriad consequences, the introduction of new technology acts as a catalyst that generates a positive ripple effect which, on average, results in the creation of many more jobs – more skilled, more productive and higher-wage jobs – than it destroys.
 The rising productivity made possible by technology reduces production costs and thereby lowers the price of products and services to customers and consumers.
 The lower prices result in increased demand, greater consumption, higher levels of production and even greater cost reductions due to economies of scale.
 This represents only the first cycle of job creation.
 While jobs are being eliminated in low-skilled manual or assembly operations, simultaneously they are being created in industries that manufacture and service the more sophisticated machines, as well as in Research and Development (R &D) laboratories that develop the new machines, materials and manufacturing processes.
 The workers who operate the improved machines require higher levels of skill, which demands more education and training, thus creating demand for jobs in the service sector.
 The more productive and higher-paid industrial workers utilize their enhanced purchasing power to buy more goods and services than before – spending more on travel, consumer goods, housing, leisure, health and the education of offspring, and thus creating demand for more jobs in other industries.
 Rising incomes generate higher standards and expectations, bringing changes in lifestyle that create new needs and new commercial activities.
 This process has led to enormous growth in new jobs.

 The bricks piled up as she tried to manipulate the buttons.
 But by the time she began her third game, she'd mastered them, and she got over 5000 points.

She's with my mother."
 My confusion must have been more than usually self-evident as I sat up.
 "No, Mother isn't going through a good episode.
 She's asleep.
 Rachel crept into her room and crawled into bed with her.
 It's a poor substitute for what she aches for, but it's all Mother can offer right now."
 "Alec, there must be something we can do."
 He gently captured my hands, stilling their frantic motion and shook his head.

But it has also engendered a way of life in which the livelihood of individuals is far more dependent than in the past on external conditions – the state of the national and global economy, trade policies, interest and exchange rates, levels of military spending and overall consumer demand.
 Modern society, even in the most liberal democracies, has become so structured that it leaves less and less freedom for truly independent individual initiative.
 Today, government intervenes in virtually every aspect of society’s economic existence, restricting the freedom of the individual to seek his or her own livelihood and determining the type and number of job opportunities available.
 Employment opportunities are directly linked to government tax policy concerning capital gains, depreciation, energy, wages and salaries, as well as by policies governing minimum wage laws, interest rates, budget deficits, imports and exports, environmental regulations and restrictions, defence spending, immigration, industrial development, investment, licensing of practitioners, zoning laws and countless other public policy issues.
 Without access to jobs, people lack the ability to ensure their own survival and support in modern society.
 As government has assured the right to education – indeed, compels it – it can and must also ensure the right of every person to gainful employment.
 Our very concept of the rights of the individual and the responsibilities of the society must undergo radical change.
 UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has called for a broader definition of human rights to include economic as well as political rights.
 The essential basis for meeting the world’s employment needs is the realization that employment is an absolute necessity for survival in modern society and must be recognized as a fundamental right of every human being.
 Pragmatism as well as idealism compels this step.

 I felt my heart skip another beat.
 Everything good that I'd attributed to Brandon had been Alec all along.

 The chills were back, and they'd redoubled in intensity.
 It was like the howl from my dream was echoing through my soul.

I was unsure how long I’d slept but it looked like the sun was rising again and I wanted to be out of the house before I ran into Fannie.
 It was probably too early to hope to see Chevelle.
 I’d spent the last two days with him, but he hadn’t revealed anything of himself and that had only made me more curious.
 I retrieved the documents I’d hidden after my second trip to the library to find out whether they added anything to the report from the Council’s record-keeper.
 There wasn’t much new there, mostly more names, but I did notice a watermark on one of the pages.
 I held it up to the light to better see.
 It was a Council marking and something else.
 I dug out the first pages from under my mattress and examined them closer.
 The pages directly from the record-keeper’s report all included the same Council mark plus a string of characters.
 Trying to decode them, I realized one of the symbols might simply be a page number.

Dominic had smiled shyly in my direction as we'd climbed into an ostentatious black Mercedes.
 Jasmin just looked like she'd rather be anywhere than on babysitting duty.
 Rachel had explained that Alec didn't want us delicate, fragile girls traveling alone, so he'd assigned us bodyguards, who happened to also be female and delicate-looking, but who weren't nearly as fragile.
 Also, it turned out we weren't going to Sanctuary, or St. George, or even anywhere in Utah, a fact I didn't realize until we'd been on the road for twenty minutes.
 "Oh, Adri, don't be silly.
 You can't do real shopping in Sanctuary.
 Besides, Alec wouldn't have let the four of us go alone if we'd been planning on staying so close to Brandon's territory.
 Vegas was definitely the best option given the time restrictions we're under."
 I'd settled in for a long trip, only to realize as we crossed the state line that Jasmin was positively shattering the speed limit.
 I managed to limit myself to a single gulp, when I saw just how fast she was going, but everyone else was so relaxed that I finally managed to unclench my fists and join back in the conversation.

 I opened my eyes the next morning, the sun’s rays shinning through my bedroom window.

Powerfully aroused by that moan, Rick slid one hand down her back to press her closer.
 She shuddered with pleasure as he began kissing her neck.
 He undid the first button on her dress.
 "I want you, Marie," he rasped, raising his head to look into her eyes.
 Marie gazed into his eyes for a moment.
 "I can't!"
 she whispered hoarsely.

Soon, Brandon moved in with his girlfriend, Tiffanie, and she was as strung out as he was.
 When they were together, they looked like two skeletons embracing.
 They had grown fuzzy around their edges; it’s difficult to describe how they clung to each other in a desperate way as if they didn’t know where one ended and the other began.
 It was more than teenage passion driving them to that; it was dependence, an unhealthy co-dependence.
 They couldn’t meet anyone’s eyes; their pinpoint pupils darted around the room when I spoke to them.
 They couldn’t answer simple questions coherently.
 They babbled and told those outrageous stories.
 They were sick.
 When my wife and I heard sirens or the phone rang late at night, we always thought the worst.

Though she was big and hearty, today she looked undone, like a visitor to Auschwitz.
 “Sit down, Kenneth.” “What’d I do?” “It’s about Eric.” Studying her mournful eyes, I eased myself into the chair.
 “Yeah?” “They crashed.” My heart stopped and I gave up breathing.
 “Eric?” I gasped.
 "El Cajon Valley Hospital.
 They don’t believe he’ll make it.” My brain catapulted through space, into a black hole.

 Guess not, she thought.
 A shove put him on his back.

This does not mean that every country can accomplish the goal immediately.
 Nor does it mean that governments should try to spend their way out of unemployment by creating artificial jobs for all who seek them.
 But the high current costs of the unemployed certainly suggest that there are more constructive ways to spend available resources to solve the problem.
 Instead, a commitment to self-employment should lead the government to reexamine and where necessary alter the nature of its priorities and policies and the structure of its economic system in order to make achievement of this goal possible.
 The magnitude of the task and the prescription may vary, but the goal and determination can be shared by all.
 Employment Strategies for the Industrial Nations
 In the industrial countries, the phenomena of jobless growth coupled with persistently high rates of youth unemployment and of chronic unemployment among the poorer sections will not be eradicated by even the most optimistic rates of economic expansion or mere incremental adjustments within the context of present attitudes and policies.
 Although the problem has been aggravated by a variety of short- and medium-term factors whose effects will gradually dissipate over time – defence cuts, recession, East European economic crisis, German reunification, etc.
 – the present job crisis among Western nations is largely structural in nature.
 Although conditions vary from country to country, the crisis impacts most heavily on the unskilled, young people, urban poor, ethnic minorities and older workers.

 “You’re a horrible liar Seth.” “I know,” I felt him sigh.

Especially since it was pretty obvious that he himself had something to gain by convincing her that she shouldn’t marry Davis.
 His sister had once told him that a girl usually wouldn’t even believe her best friend if she told her that her boyfriend was cheating on her.
 He went back to his office and read the article again.
 He should have shown it to Marie before he’d fallen in love with her.
 But he was afraid to tell her he’d known of her before she’d walked into the garden.
 What if she thought he’d done something to cause it?
 Marie was growing increasingly frustrated with the books she was reading.
 There were all kinds of theories about how to travel through time, but there was absolutely nothing that could explain how she’d traveled through time.
 She hadn’t gotten in a time machine, hadn’t been near a dead star, hadn’t been thinking about 2011.
 That was another thing—most of the articles talked about traveling back in time, not forward.

National youth service corps and military personnel can be utilized to help provide the necessary manpower.
 Second, every possible step must be taken to provide education for female children, an essential requirement for social equity and quality of life improvement.
 Nearly two-thirds of the world’s illiterate are women.
 In the poorest developing countries, literacy rates among females are 40 per cent below rates for males and the average number of years of schooling for females is 60 per cent lower.
 But perceptible progress has been made.
 Between 1980 and 1990, female primary school enrolment rose from 44 per cent to 47 per cent of total enrolment, although it actually declined in the Arab states and remained virtually unchanged in South Asia.
 Uneducated females represent a huge reservoir of untapped human potential that must be given every opportunity and full assistance to develop their innate capacities.
 This will call for accelerated efforts to establish crèche and child-care facilities, abolish child labour, and remove gender bias from text books and educational institutions.
 The cost of raising female educational levels up to that of males worldwide has been estimated at $2.5 billion, a small amount for an initiative that could have such wide-ranging benefits.

 last week I never got home before 9:00."
 Her eyes widened, and he grinned, continuing, "But today I'll be home by 5:30.
 I promise."
 She wandered around the house restlessly after he'd left.
 His house was big, and he had a lot of interesting things, but she didn't like being alone.
 It just made her miss her family and friends and Davis that much more.
 Hoping that television would provide the illusion of companionship and take her mind off her homesickness, she went to the living room and turned it on.
 That was where Rick found her at 5:30.

Then I saw the incredibly beautiful rose on our porch.
 I picked it up, trimmed the bottom inch or so off with a knife, and got it into some water acting out of nothing more than pure habit.
 Dad had always kept at least a pair of rose bushes alive.
 He'd loved nothing more than giving Mom roses.
 Once I'd safely done my part to help prolong the future life of the gorgeous specimen, I got down to really examining it.
 I was far from an expert on roses, but I'd looked through pictures of hundreds of different kinds of tea roses, and never seen anything quite like this one.
 It was as big as some of the largest specimens I'd seen, and had at least fifty percent more petals than most of the 'very full' varieties I was familiar with.
 That in and of itself was pretty amazing, but nothing in comparison to the petals themselves.
 They were the purest white edged in a breathtaking purple.
 Equally amazing was just how velvety they were.

It was nearly 7:00 when they left, and Marie was all in favor of pizza in the room this time.
 "I don't think I can wait," she told Rick when he hung up the phone after ordering the pizza.
 "Do you want me to go get you a candy bar?"
 "No.
 I'm going to go take a shower while we wait."
 After her shower she rubbed on some rose-scented lotion.
 Her skin was hot from her day in the sun and just a little red.
 She'd put sunscreen on this morning so that she wouldn't get burned.
 Dropping the bottle onto the bed, she went back to Rick's room calling, "Is the pizza here yet?"
 "Not yet," he replied as he emerged from the bathroom, still toweling his hair dry.

"I'm sorry, Donovan, it's just that I really hate shopping."
 "Ah, yes.
 Might I suggest that possibly is due to the fact you've never pursued the activity in the right company?"
 ** Right company indeed.
 I'd expected it would just be Rachel and I, and that we'd make a quick run in to Sanctuary, which seemed silly seeing as how my house was just as close as town was.
 I was wrong on both accounts.
 The company, as Donovan had dubbed it, also included Dominic and Jasmin.
 Dominic had smiled shyly in my direction as we'd climbed into an ostentatious black Mercedes.
 Jasmin just looked like she'd rather be anywhere than on babysitting duty.
 Rachel had explained that Alec didn't want us delicate, fragile girls traveling alone, so he'd assigned us bodyguards, who happened to also be female and delicate-looking, but who weren't nearly as fragile.

One in ten jobs is now replaced in OECD countries every year.
 This makes the strengthening of job placement systems a crucial element in any full employment strategy.
 Lack of access to information about job or training opportunities retards re-employment.
 Sweden operates one of the most extensive and efficient employment services, in close cooperation with business, that is responsible for filling 60 per cent of total job vacancies.
 Improve labour market information systems within and between countries by increasing the accuracy and comparability of data, requiring mandatory reporting by businesses of all sizes, and freely exchanging information between cities, states and countries on successful employment-generating strategies.

 Lack of qualifications, inadequate and out-dated skills commonly characterize the long-term unemployed.
 There is a strong positive correlation between higher education and higher incomes.
 The employment rate for college graduates in the United States is 75 per cent versus 48 per cent for high school drop- outs; at the height of the recent recession, 3.2 per cent of college graduates were unemployed compared with 11.4 per cent of high school drop-outs.

This trend, if not halted and reversed, casts a renewed spell of gloom over the hopes of hundreds of millions of people to escape from hunger, and over all our hopes for peace in the twenty-first century.
 The projection of future prospects based on past trends is especially questionable with regard to food.
 Not even some of the most prominent agricultural economists expected the gains in food production which have occurred in the past several decades.
 An international team of experts visiting India in 1963 projected a mere 10 per cent growth in foodgrain production by 1970, whereas growth actually achieved during this period was 50 per cent.
 Neither technological, nor financial nor natural resources pose insurmountable obstacles to achieving dramatically more over the next 15 years than is indicated by past trends or current projections.
 The idea that hunger cannot be conquered because we are running out of land to support rapidly burgeoning populations is contradicted by the facts.
 Globally, there is no correlation between population density and hunger.
 China, with only half as much arable land per capita as India, produces 13 per cent more foodgrains per capita.
 Taiwan and South Korea have only half the farmland per capita of Bangladesh, yet they produce 40 per cent more food per capita.
 Tiny Netherlands, with the highest population density in the world, produces more than sufficient food to feed itself and remain a large net food exporter.

I needed to stay on this path, now more than ever.
 Chevelle’s words rolled through my mind.
 He thought I wouldn’t give up because I’d seen the map.
 Something about that nagged at me, but Ruby waited while I searched for a response.
 Chevelle opened the door and I knew I was saved from at least that much.
 When he saw me, he was struck still.
 I had forgotten Ruby’s “treatments” until she squealed in delight at his response.
 He composed his face again, but she’d already marked him.
 “Oh, you like it.

I took the opportunity to move closer, cuddling up next to him.
 I didn't bother looking up at the sky.
 Truth be told, I had all the beauty I needed right in front of me.
 His slight start as my head came to rest on his arm was disappointing but entirely predictable.
 He adjusted my blanket slightly so it was between us and then pulled me closer.
 He was perfectly happy to touch me as long as there wasn't any actual skin on skin contact.
 Every time I pushed for more he backed away or found somewhere else he had to be.

The chain of agricultural training needs to be filled out at the lower level by establishing thousands of village-level farm schools as proposed in the chapter on food security.
 The switch from centrally planned to market-oriented economic systems in Eastern Europe cannot be successful until the population has acquired the skills needed to function effectively in the new economic environment.
 Under the communist system, emphasis was placed on education and training in technical subjects with little attention to marketing, organizational, commercial and interpersonal skills, which are essential requirements for functioning in a market economy.
 A detailed inventory should be compiled of the types and levels of skills needed for transition to the market, covering areas such as entrepreneurship, management, national and international marketing, strategic business planning, finance, quality control, product development, production technology, design, and human resource development.
 Intensive training programmes need to be introduced to impart these skills on a massive scale.
 Even in the most advanced industrial nations there is vast scope for upgrading skills to improve productivity and to keep pace with rapid technological development.
 Inadequate skills are a major impediment to the assimilation of new technologies.
 The increasing demands of global competitiveness place pressure on workers in these countries to continuously improve their skills.
 The mismatch between the skills of the workforce and the evolving needs of industry aggravates unemployment.
 Studies of the return on investment from training programmes document the enormous benefits of continuously upgrading the skills of the workforce.

As I turned my light out and got into bed I realized there'd been one bright spot to the day.
 Brandon Worthingfield III might not really be interested in me, but he was obviously at the top of the social food chain, and he'd already shown me way more attention than any of the boys back home ever had.
 Maybe there was some hope after all.
 ** I was lost, not just in the sense of not knowing where I was, but because I'd never been anywhere even remotely like this.
 The breeze was louder than any I'd ever heard before, and was laden with an unimaginable host of scents.
 It took me several seconds to sort through things enough to realize I was smelling things I didn't even have a name for.
 After several seconds of trying to catalog the most delightful of my new discoveries, I realized I'd had my eyes closed since I'd gotten here, possibly an unconscious defense mechanism meant to protect me from sensory overload.
 The distant sound of water trickling down a rock face, of leaves gently caressing each other in the breeze faded away as I took in an amazing wonderland of light.
 The trees I'd been listening to were exactly where I expected them to be, but it took me several heartbeats to recognize them.
 Gone were the sturdy, brown behemoths I'd spent so much time climbing with Cindi.

The substitute teacher sitting at his desk didn't even take roll; he just shut the door, told us to keep it down, and flipped open a magazine.
 While I was sitting at my desk wondering what to do with the next hour of my life, something I'd read in the physics book suddenly clicked.
 In a perfect world I would've been left in peace to finish reasoning out the answer.
 Instead, Britney leaned over and smiled.
 "So I was really surprised to see you with Brandon.
 I thought for sure he'd be pissed after you made Cassie back down like that."
 "Surprise, surprise, maybe he isn't as shallow and vindictive as you thought."
 The words were mean, but they felt good.
 There were a lot of other, even worse things on the tip of my tongue, things I really wanted to say.
 For a moment, my anger warred with the fear of being completely friendless.

She'd sobbed and told him over and over how much she loved him and begged him not to break up with her.
 A month later he'd read of her engagement to another man.
 He'd actually proposed to Kim, but once she had the ring, all she'd wanted to talk about was what pieces she was going to buy to refurnish the house and at which resorts they were going to spend their summers and how much of his money was in the bank and how much in land investments.
 He'd broken up with her six weeks after proposing.
 He'd never gotten the ring back, of course.
 He was lonely.
 Rick sighed, setting down the carton of fried rice and leaning back.
 That was why he’d been foolish enough to ask Kim to marry him, he now realized.
 He was much more cautious now.

 “Sooner?” Harruq said.

 He swore a few times, getting progressively more colorful as he went.
 “Two minutes alone with that guard,” he muttered.
 “I’d have him drinking through a brand new hole in his neck.”
 “How skilled are you with those?” Qurrah asked, gesturing at the swords in the grass next to Harruq.
 Even though they lived in such cramped quarters, Qurrah still knew very little of Harruq’s life other than what he did at his request.

While he had seen the two interact for some years, he really did not know what was appropriate for him to say in such a circumstance.
 Rodregas knew that he did not have the skills for pretending he was a powerful Immortalist sorcerer, so he said, “How many people have you killed during the past year Korin?
 And how many others have you raped or tortured?” he asked, trying to keep a calm voice.
 Now Korin looked very surprised and he started looking around.
 Rodregas saw that Korin noticed the study door, though he was working hard to not show it.
 “How many?” Rodregas repeated his question.
 “I am not sure,” Korin said.
 “For us to truly become divine we must of course develop our skills.” As Korin answered the question he took a step back.

 I managed to put the impending drawing more or less out of my mind for the first half of the day, but I actually missed Britney's constant gossip.
 There was almost no redeeming value to most of what she said, but it did have the benefit of being distracting.
 By the time lunch finally came around I needed some kind of distraction.
 This was my only chance to see Les Misérables performed live before I turned forty.
 Unfortunately, while the conversation at Brandon's table was plentiful, it wasn't very distracting.

Safety Nets: Long-term solution to the problem of food security requires efforts that will make people food self-sufficient.
 But until those efforts can be put in place and made effective, continued reliance will have to be placed on public programmes such as India’s highly successful Mid-Day Meal scheme for school children and Food for Work programs that combine employment and food security.
 The traditional concept of Food for Work needs to be enlarged to include skilled work related to human and social development.
 A Global Food Guarantee scheme should be put in place, which combines Food for Work and Employment Guarantee in a systematic manner.
 Human Development
 Development is a human process.
 It is the result of human aspirations turned into action, human energies expressed in thought and work, human imagination and creativity turned toward the upliftment of life, the invention of processes and products to enhance human productivity, the accumulation of knowledge and wisdom passed on from one generation to another, the acquisition and perfection of skills transmitted from parent to child, the conversion of talents into capacities, the pursuit of ideals, an ever widening of attitudes, and the evolution of more complex and productive forms of organization.
 As this evolutionary process unfolds, each element of human personality -- physical skill, vital relationship, mental understanding, spiritual values – is enhanced in a progression without end, bringing with it greater material fruits, richer life experience, and higher knowledge.
 The unfolding and flowering of the human being is at once the source and the goal of development.
 Thus, in all our efforts to elevate human society, our primary endeavour must be to enhance these human endowments and expand individual freedom of self-expression.

The worry throbbed in my head; it felt like my mind could splinter.

But then it occurred to me that maybe I had been the cause of it.
 I was resigned now, the fury gone, and so was the screeching, the pain.
 They had said the binding was dangerous… There was a collective gasp as they realized I was back.
 I heard someone beside me and a flash of anger swept through me, lighting a flame at whoever it was.
 So maybe the fury wasn’t completely gone.
 I suddenly remembered the pages I had burnt in the briar patch so long ago.
 Burnt before I’d read them.
 My eyes flashed open.

A few seconds later the pair was screaming out of the parking lot, and my breathing was too labored for it to be anything other than a full-blown panic attack.
 I made it another couple steps, just far enough to grab Britney as I started to fall.
 I had a split second to be grateful I'd lost all of that weight so Britney wouldn't collapse under me, and then the darkness claimed me.
 Even though I knew I wouldn't remember the void when I finally came to, I wanted nothing more than to just float in the darkness.
 It had been a hard day.
 I'd....actually I wasn't sure why it'd been a hard day, but something told me I'd unconsciously been at the end of my rope just before I'd collapsed.
 Unfortunately that same thing told me I couldn't dwell here in the comforting absence, there was a very important reason for me to regain my feet.
 The void was reluctant to let me go, stripping me of memories and experiences as I fought my way free.
 By the time I was near surfacing I no longer remembered just how much I'd wanted to stay.
 Britney was pacing back and forth when I opened my eyes.

Oh, Mother, I wish you could meet him.

 "Is he the reason you ended your betrothal?"
 "In a way.
 I didn't have a chance to tell you about the last time I was with Davis.
 You and Father were out, and we came here to listen to the radio.
 He kissed me, which was wonderful at first.
 But then he started kissing me so hard that my teeth cut into my lips, and I tried to push him away, but he wouldn't stop.
 And he put his hand under my skirt to touch my leg.
 I was finally able to push him away, and all he said was to make sure that you told me what my duties would be once we were married."

We need the technology vastly to improve productivity in poor countries.
 We need the organizational know-how to create effective administrative and political systems in transition states and to restructure international institutions.
 We require enormous investments in constructive economic activities – as opposed to lavish arms spending – to generate jobs and higher incomes for hundreds of millions of people in the developing world, and by extension to stimulate further economic growth and job creation in the West.
 All these essential ingredients are available in abundant measure, if only we choose to employ them for our common benefit.
 Yet even this is not enough.
 Otherwise, we would already have accomplished many of our goals.
 Above and beyond these material, social and financial resources, we need a new vision, a new perspective and new attitudes about what can and must be done.
 If the events of the past seven years prove anything, it is that a massive change of attitude and perspective, such as the one brought about between East and West, is imminently possible and incredibly powerful.
 The one we have all been party to has immensely altered the world’s political and economic landscape – sweeping away at a single stroke the very real danger of another world war and widespread nuclear destruction.
 The recommendations formulated in this report call for profound changes in the way we think, feel and act to meet the challenges and tap the opportunities of the coming decade.

I'd kind of known I'd have an incredible amount of material to catch up on from the first part of the semester.
 I hadn't anticipated that every other student was going to spend the class carefully ignoring me.
 I'd never really fit in, but this was unbelievable.
 New students could always count on someone to offer to be their friends.
 I'd seen it a dozen times before as people had moved in.
 The really attractive people got drawn into the popular circles, less cool people were offered a place with the punks, the nerds, or at least with the drug users, who didn't care as much what you looked or acted like as long as you were hooked on something illegal.
 I knew I had serious problems, but I didn't think they were obvious to everyone that looked at me.
 English was next, and odds were it would be a nearly exact repeat of Biology, possibly minus the awkward introduction.
 The thin, distinguished looking teacher absently accepted my proffered form, starting a little when I didn't leave.

 The air was cold, a sudden chill from the north chasing away the heat of the day.
 Qurrah wrapped himself best he could as he climbed the hill.
 He spotted the small fire, and beside it Velixar bathed in its red glow.
 The fledgling necromancer took his seat across from the man in black.
 “Are you ready to listen?” Velixar asked.
 Qurrah nodded.
 “Good.

"That settles it.

 Alec's smile nearly made me cry.

 You need some time to get your bearings again.
 Going cold turkey is generally the best way to kill an addiction."
 We'd been through this more than once since he'd killed Brandon.

It hurt me deeply to contemplate Thomas’s complete disregard for our relationship as brothers and his choice to take this merchandise from my addicted partner while knowing full well that it would financially destroy my business and thus me.
 Pete had already disappeared for several weeks when I discovered what he was doing, but it was too late and the business closed within a month after the invoices for all of these portable spas and waterbeds started arriving.
 The checking account had been completely drained of any operating capital.
 Bad business partner, and bad best friend: My girlfriend at the time, Karen, had hidden her drug habit from me, and by the time I discovered it she had emptied our joint savings account and was screwing my ex-partner/best friend, Pete.
 They were both very addicted to cocaine and I guess they belonged together because neither one of them belonged with me.
 I went to her apartment where I caught them together.
 I beat him within an inch of his life in front of her.
 Karen and her roommate did everything they could to pull me off of him but my rage for his complete abandonment of our friendship in so many ways had escalated to the perfect storm.
 It seemed he had taken everything from me and he had been my closest friend for the last six years and I snapped.
 This was a defining moment in my life, where I began to truly understand what drugs could make you do.

I examined their wide noses, rounded ears, and stubby fingers.
 Those who wore no shoes had short, thick toes like trolls.
 The men had patches of hair curled on their chests and forearms and some even grew it around their chins like goats.
 Their clothes were tattered and ill-fitting rags.
 They moved about the camp slowly.
 Clearly they had no magic, and they definitely were the owners of the crude tools we had found.
 They spoke to each other often, their voices like the protest of an old hound.
 I watched until nightfall, when they settled into tents and lean-tos.
 They seemed to assign a watchman, wielding only a torch lit from the central fire.

For a moment the Heavenly Realm was silent.
 All the creatures knew the roar.
 The great Celestial Lion was on the hunt and when he found his prey, there would be a battle to shake all the realms.
 As the roar faded in the heavens, a new Knight Captain, a chosen Champion of a Goddess, stood in the great Cathedral of the Heavens.
 He heard the roar because it was his.
 The other hunters in his pride were at his side and ready.
 It was time to start the hunt.

“Nothing to worry about,” Ruby assured me.
 “Just a hunting trip.” I was still muddled, but I knew it wouldn’t take three of them to hunt.
 And then I remembered the bits of conversation I’d heard when I woke.
 “Someone’s missing?” I took stock.
 I’d seen everyone but Rhys and Rider now.
 And the wolves.

“How did you connect the three of us to these crimes?” Van’dret shrugged and smiled and said, “To be honest, I did not really think you were the ones.

 Now, it is my turn to ask a question.” “Actually,” interrupted Rodregas, “you already asked me about being an old soldier.

The End of Something Else
 A couple weeks after Eric's funeral, Cliff and I decided we should quit school and move to San Francisco.
 When school let out that day, we went up the street to La Mesa Junior High and found my mom grading papers on the patio behind her classroom.
 We told her our plans and listened while she recited all the reasons leaving now, three months short of graduation, was all wrong.
 She even tried to bribe us, offering to help with money if we would wait until June and apply to a San Francisco college.
 "Nope," I said.
 "If we wait, we probably won't go."
 Cliff was more sensible.
 He said my mom could be right.
 I didn't relent until after his mom lectured us in practically the same words.

We did not know what drug he was on or how far he would go.
 When he moved to southern California, we were not faced with Thomas’s problems anymore.
 I crossed him off of my list—the brother who had stood shoulder to shoulder with me through all the moves, the abuse, and so much else.
 The brother who for a while was all I had was completely estranged from me.
 I had put Thomas in a similar category as my biological Father, Richard.
 I considered that in both of their cases, nothing good seemed to happen when I associated with them so I just kept them out of my life and my family’s as well.
 The latest stories I had heard about Thomas were that while at one point he had escalated his abuse to injecting heroin, he then attended a drug rehab center called Narconon, which had apparently enabled him to be clean for the last couple of years.
 If this was true, and he was clean, maybe he’d be a good person to go to for help?
 My mother thought so, and she insisted that we reach out to him.
 We were obviously reluctant and for good reason, but we were also desperate.

Shift from commodity-based to resource-based planning
 The responsibility of governments to achieve dramatic increases in foodgrain production to keep pace with population growth naturally led to a commodity-based approach to agricultural development in many developing countries.
 Governments projected demand, set production targets for specific crops, and instituted programmes to help farmers produce the food needed to meet the minimum needs of the population.
 But once shortages are eliminated, the focus on specific commodities becomes a barrier to further agricultural development, because it retards diversification into more profitable commercial crops.
 Contrary to free market theory, farmers in many countries have tended to continue production of traditional crops, even when prices have fallen in response to increased supplies.
 There is still a need for government to educate and encourage farmers to adopt resource-based planning, oriented to national and international market potentials and based on principles of economics, employment and ecology.
 Resource-based planning examines how the available land and water resources can best be utilized to achieve maximum and sustainable economic return to the farmer, which is only rarely the priority of governments in developing countries that tend to focus on production targets for specific commodities.
 This shift can lead to diversification into commercial crops, such as fruit and vegetables, that generate significant increases in on-farm employment and incomes and act as a stimulus to downstream agro-industries.
 From minimum needs to maximum potentials
 The factors which have perpetuated commodity-based planning in agriculture have also fostered an emphasis on minimum targets, rather than maximum goals.

anning to maximize economic returns is a major factor92m in0m the decline of production92m of0m traditional crops and the lack of sustainable agricultural92m development0m in developing countries.

One Friday night, I arrived just as they were leaving for a jazz club.
 Before climbing into Richard’s car, Sylvia commanded me, “If you brought any liquor, Kenneth, go away.” I agreed and waited until they drove off before scooping a pint of bourbon and a bottle of ginger ale out of my Chevrolet’s trunk.
 I wanted to get numb.
 For about the tenth time, Karen Flagstad had rejected me, even though a few days before I had warned her that if she wouldn’t join me at a movie that weekend, I would fast until death.
 From breakfast Monday until late Wednesday afternoon, all I had ingested were three beers and a Coke.
 Then I gobbled two jumbo hamburgers and spent the night consuming aspirins, with my head on two pillows because one alone felt hard as pavement.
 The next day, after Spanish class on Friday, I recounted my ordeal to Karen and explained that all my suffering certainly must have earned me her company at the movies.
 She congenially disagreed.
 While Eric and I drank bourbon and ginger ale, I griped about Karen.
 At first I acted tough and unruffled, but soon the bourbon took hold, and I confessed the pain in my gut that had nothing to do with fasting.

It stretched out long enough that for a moment I didn't think he was going to answer, but then he nodded, a long deliberate motion that left no question but that it was a confirmation.
 I wanted to ask more, but didn't want to venture into the kinds of things that would get him in trouble with Alec.
 We walked for another minute or so before I was struck with the silliness of someone who was old enough to be my great grandfather calling me 'Mistress Paige.'
 "Donovan, you could just call me Adri if you want."
 "That would hardly be appropriate, mistress."
 "It just seems silly.
 I mean, I'm not really part of the family or anything, so there isn't really a need, is there?"
 Donovan's smile was incredibly gentle as he shook his head in disagreement.

I was once again psyching myself up to be seen in public, when Donovan limped into the room and cleared his throat.
 "The gentlemen have at long last arrived."
 Isaac was the first one through the door, looking particularly 007 in a tux that amazingly enough had the occasional silver thread that matched perfectly with Jessica's dress.
 I looked up from his outfit just in time to see a flash of concern melt away into relief.
 I had just a moment to wonder at the novelty of Isaac showing that much emotion all at one time, and then James stalked through the door in a tux that was so cutting edge, that I wasn't sure if there was anything else like it anywhere in the States.
 The shimmery nature of the fabric combined with an unusually angular, sharp cut to make it different than anything else I'd ever seen.
 I worked my way up from the blindingly-polished black shoes, to the splash of deep red peeking out of his chest pocket, and somewhere along the way decided I loved the tux.
 As amazing as James' and Isaac's tuxes were, I was already looking past them, craning my neck to see down the hall in a vain effort to catch a glimpse of Alec.
 There was no reason for my heart to be pounding away so furiously in my chest, but unlikely or not, my body at least seemed convinced he was going to change his mind and leave me standing here by myself.
 Rachel looked up from her conversation with Jasmin just long enough to give me a reassuring smile, and then I heard the barest whisper of sound.

 Although national and international institutions maintain a variety of data bases and models to track the impact of production, trade and prices in agriculture, these models are too limited in scope and detail to construct a working global model of the agricultural sector, which could serve as a valuable tool in projecting the medium- and long-term interactions of changes in food production, consumption, employment, trade, productivity, technology and environmental factors.
 A world food model, which forms the essential basis for evolving a global strategic plan, can help eliminate both food deficits and surpluses.
 6.On-farm training.
 The massive demonstration programmes, conducted in farmers' own fields by countries such as India to propagate the Green Revolution technology, proved that even uneducated, traditional peasant farmers in developing countries will rush to adopt new technology when its application and benefits are clearly demonstrated.
 The slow dissemination of new technologies that still hampers agriculture in these countries is largely due to the ineffectiveness of more traditional types of extension and farmer education conducted on a relatively limited scale by agricultural colleges, technical institutes and research stations.
 This gap in the agricultural education system can be closed by expanding the agricultural training network to the village level.
 The establishment of farm schools in villages, on land temporarily leased from local farmers, can combine the advantages of both formal training and demonstration on farmers' fields, with emphasis on economic viability and ecological sustainability.

 My confusion must have been more than usually self-evident as I sat up.

I'm afraid I've been called into a surprise meeting with the school administration.

You’ll lie down when I say you’ll lie down…” I bit down on a groan, eyes running over the wood grain of the table as I tuned her out.
 I knew the outcome if I didn’t, and I was already in trouble enough.
 Shortly after her tirade insisting I stay until I had earned permission to leave, the one-sided argument ran its course and Fannie tired of looking at me and sent me on my way.
 I trudged out of the kitchen, through the main sitting area, and into my room.
 It was dark except for a small beam of light from a knothole in the wall.
 Fire was the one magic I had mastered; I had been able to light lanterns and candles for as long as I could remember, but I didn’t bother.
 If I was in this room, I wanted to be alone.
 And in darkness I felt more so.

Peace-building activities should address underlying economic and social factors that prevent the establishment of a stable and secure peace.
 In instances such as Cambodia, Rwanda and Somalia, the vacuum created by the complete collapse of political and economic institutions necessitates a broader role for the UN in re-establishing the peace.
 Peace building has thus far been defined as post-conflict actions to support reconstruction and to strengthen and solidify peace.
 The concept needs to be broadened to include pre-conflict actions and expanded to encompass a wider array of potentially destabilizing factors that lead to conflicts.
 The Commission supports the establishment of an International Centre jointly operated by the UN Security Council and UNESCO to implement peace-building programmes.
 Peace-building activities should be expanded to address security threats issuing from environmental degradation, poverty, migration of population and refugees.
 Many cases of ethnic conflict have an under lying basis of economic deprivation that must be addressed before tensions will permanently subside.
 Others can be mitigated by the introduction of positive economic incentives for cooperation.
 Economic cooperation is already dissipating ethnic tensions and conflict in the Middle East.
 It can be creatively fostered in the Balkans and elsewhere.

When he noticed her glance, she dropped her eyes to the bread she was buttering.
 "Rick," she began at last, "do you remember when you first kissed me?"
 "With perfect clarity."
 He grinned at her.

 "I wanted you to kiss me then."
 "I know."
 When she looked up in astonishment, he explained, "I wouldn't have kissed you if you hadn't wanted me to.

 I made it another couple steps, just far enough to grab Britney as I started to fall.
 I had a split second to be grateful I'd lost all of that weight so Britney wouldn't collapse under me, and then the darkness claimed me.
 Even though I knew I wouldn't remember the void when I finally came to, I wanted nothing more than to just float in the darkness.
 It had been a hard day.
 I'd....actually I wasn't sure why it'd been a hard day, but something told me I'd unconsciously been at the end of my rope just before I'd collapsed.
 Unfortunately that same thing told me I couldn't dwell here in the comforting absence, there was a very important reason for me to regain my feet.
 The void was reluctant to let me go, stripping me of memories and experiences as I fought my way free.
 By the time I was near surfacing I no longer remembered just how much I'd wanted to stay.

"I'm sure it isn't as bad as that."
 I wanted to disagree, to go into detail about why my life had just taken a turn for the worse, but something about his manner was suddenly distant.
 I thought about calling him out on it, but with my life suddenly looking like I was all but friendless, that didn't seem like such a good idea.
 Without really meaning to I'd managed to alienate just about everyone at school.
 Brandon already had plenty of reasons not to be with me, it was the height of stupidity to give him any more.
 I could probably deal with not having a boyfriend, even assuming that was what we were right now.
 Going half a year without anyone to talk to because my mom was wrapped up with her art and everyone else in the town thought I was stuck-up would be more than I could take.
 The thought was enough to leave me speechless for the entire drive home.
 Brandon seemed content to leave me alone with my thoughts as he sped around the various turns at speeds that normally would've made me protest.
 As I went to leave the car, he grabbed me by my back pocket, which nearly made me shriek in surprise.

They then dragged the body outside to where the deceased elf had kept a private garden.
 Thick brick walls guarded against any prying eyes.
 They dug a large hole in a corner and then bled the body dry, letting the fluids soak into the dirt.
 Occasionally, they would halt and listen, worried their violent struggle had reached unwanted ears.
 No curious investigators arrived, however, and they continued with their dark deed.
 When the blood dripping from the elf’s wounds became but a trickle, they filled the hole and moved on.
 Using the clothes and robes from upstairs, the two brothers wiped away as much of Ahrqur’s blood as they could.
 They tossed the bloody clothes, the table, and the pieces of glass they into the fireplace and burned them.

Upon her exit, the portal closed, swirling away as if it had never existed.

One of them was Crime and Punishment, by Fyodor Dostoyevski.
 The story tells of Raskolnikov, a dropped out university student a few years older than me, who is possessed with a deep bitterness because he is brilliant but also poor.
 Both to save his sister from marrying a wealthy snob and to prove a theory of his, he decides to rob a pawnbroker, knowing that the act might require murder.
 His theory maintains that even acts of violence can be justified for certain special people who intend to use the results of violence for the good of all or many.
 The special people, whose brilliance and high intentions exempted them from society's laws, were to me the same supermen Nietzsche urged us to become.
 The novel put me into a fever.
 I read every minute I wasn't washing pots, or smooching with Liz, or so drained from everything I couldn't help fall asleep.
 I even cut off some dates long before Liz's midnight curfew to come home and read.
 My room became Raskolnikov's basement garret.

He'd desperately wanted to keep her with him, to marry her, and he could have kept his discovery to himself and never told her he knew how to help her get home.
 But he'd wanted what was best for her.
 Hanging the housedress in the closet again, she stripped off her dress and extra set of underwear and put on Rick's t-shirt.
 Curling up on the bed, she stroked one sleeve.
 She wondered what Rick was doing right now.
 Had he gone to work?
 She suspected that he'd been too upset to work.
 He'd probably sat in the garden until he'd known for sure she was gone.
 He might even still be there, hoping she hadn't gone back, that she was lost somewhere in 2011 and would eventually call out to him to come find her.

What bomb more surely mortal Than death inside of you?
 For some men die by shrapnel, And some go down in flames, But most men perish inch by inch, In play at little games.
 Sylvia helped me remember to vow I wouldn’t go down that way.
 A while ago, a woman I enjoyed hanging out with accused me of being "serious."
 I don't think it was a compliment.
 I like to laugh, hear jokes and funny songs, whack golf balls back and forth across a fairway, cheer for teams and bring pleasant news wherever I can.
 But I don't understand how we can fail to get serious when people are burning, starving, weeping and hopelessly perishing, and while deep down we know we're not all we could be, or doing all we could do.
 In that, I'm like Sylvia Curtis.

His fingers hooked and curled in strange ways, many times so twisted and odd that Harruq could not bear to watch them dance.
 Words spilled from the frail half-orc’s lips.
 Some were strong, demanding, while others came limping out, twisted in form and barely existing as they were meant to exist.
 The words, however, did not matter as much as the dark power rolling forth from Qurrah.
 His sheer will would determine the full strength of the spell.
 A cold wind came blasting in, seemingly from all directions.
 Faster and faster, the words poured from Qurrah’s pale lips.
 Harruq braced himself as his hair fluttered before his eyes.
 The spell neared completion, and Velixar hissed in sheer pleasure at the power flaring from his apprentice.
 Qurrah shrieked out one final word, the signal, the climax of the spell.

 “Aurelia,” called a voice from behind.

 “Yes, Felewen?”
 Felewen stood beside her and faced the window.
 Her hair was tied in a long, black ponytail, her slender figure covered by rare chainmail crafted of the hardest metals known to the intelligent races.

The international community should commit itself to a minimum goal of reducing global military expenditure to $400 billion (in 1992 constant dollars) by 2000 AD.
 Military expenditure mitigates but does not resolve the underlying problem of security.
 Today, the most pressing security threats are social, not military.
 The appropriate response to them is greater investment in sustainable human development, not more arms.
 However, preservation of physical security against external aggression is a primal instinct of nation states that cannot be rationalized away.
 Nations will continue to arm themselves as long as that is the only effective means to ensure their security.
 What is needed is a quantum shift from the competitive security paradigm to a cooperative security system in which countries mutually and collectively agree to refrain from acts of aggression and to protect each other from such acts by any nation.
 This principle served to protect the NATO and Warsaw Pact countries in the past, but on an exclusive basis which promoted a polarization of alliances into military blocs and, most importantly, left more than one hundred countries outside the security orbit and vulnerable to proxy wars.
 It should now be restructured on a global basis as a collective security system that offers protection to all nations from external aggression.
 A whole range of new security challenges is rising to confront the global society.

We were still riding too fast and I was exhausted from the mental and physical exertion when he switched to full-body attacks.
 By nightfall I wasn’t able to fend off anything that came at me and he mercifully stopped the horses beneath another hollow in the mountain.
 I was asleep practically before I slid off my horse.
 The next morning I woke to the sound of rock against rock.
 There was no sign of Chevelle or his horse in the dim stone hollow.
 I sat up, rubbing my sore legs, unable to believe he’d left me.
 And then the rock wall struck me in the face.

 "I just made you spill yours, it's only fair."
 Brandon nodded at Britney, who stood there with her mouth slightly open, as he walked away.
 After a second or two of both of us staring blankly after Brandon, Britney grabbed me by the hand, the one holding the new, unopened water bottle, and pulled me over to a table in the corner.

 I'd had enough pity from my mom to last years.
 "You bet.

 I tried to inject the proper amount of blonde stupidity into my words, but wasn't sure it worked until I felt Alec's arms tighten almost painfully around me.
 I gasped, and he set me down so quickly I almost fell over.
 Before I'd even regained my balance, he was walking away, moving so quickly I would've needed to run to keep up.
 Even so, he hadn't turned away quick enough to hide the complete disdain in his expression.
 I suddenly found myself wishing I'd told him the truth rather than making him think I was stupid and manipulative.

 “Well?” I was speechless, mouth agape.
 The thing seemed as large and black as a starless night.
 Steed was pleased with my reaction, but Chevelle’s eyes rolled heavenward.
 He didn’t comment, though, simply holding out a hand to help me mount before swinging onto his own.
 “I will ride with you as far north as Naraguah and then make my way east to trade with the imps at Bray,” Steed told Chevelle.

I wrote that in Memphis, in Lorelei’s bedroom, right after we had made love.
 There was candlelight dancing on the walls, and outside one of those Memphis thunderstorms that seem like the end of the world, beautiful like the end of the world should be, and Lorelei was lying there naked, a vision out of Titian, and I just started singing those lyrics.
 Those were given to me, you know?
 Like they always existed but I was the one that plucked them from the ether.
 It’s weird, that’s the most Memphis song on the LP, though it really is about, what’s inside us, you know?
 What keeps us going, keeps us growing.
 And, it’s not true unless it makes you laugh.
 That’s what I want to say to my critics, you know, lighten up, irony isn’t dead yet.
 Well, I don’t really want to say it to them, I mean, they’ve got their lives, their maggoty little lives, and they’ve got these things they want to say and I say, god bless them.

 “This world is young, Qurrah, and Karak and Ashhur are young gods.
 Only five-hundred years ago they came and gave life to man.” Those eyes twinkled.
 “I was one of the first they made.”
 The half-orc pulled his ragged robe tighter about him as he stared into the fire.
 “How is that possible?” he asked.
 A soft wind blew, making the fire dance, and in the flickering flames Velixar smiled.
 “I was the favorite of Karak, my dear orcish friend.

A comparative study of institutions and systems in more and less developed regions and countries for every major sector will make it possible to construct accurate scales and reliable road maps for more rapid development.
 In the countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the social institutions that served under the centralized command system need to be transformed out of recognition, or entirely replaced, in order to support a market-oriented system.
 Attempts at economic reform that focus primarily on changing laws and public policy without creating the necessary institutional infrastructure cannot succeed.
 Thousands of systems that have been fashioned by human resourcefulness are needed to support economic activity in different fields.
 The system of warehouse receipts enables American grain traders to purchase unseen crops with full confidence in their quality.
 The absence of this simple system retards trade on the recently established commodity markets in Russia and other CIS countries.
 A complete listing of essential institutions, small and large, should be compiled, based on the experience of other nations, and plans drawn up for introducing them.
 Thus far, the development of social organizations, like the development of technologies, has been partial, piecemeal and sectoral, leaving large gaps between parallel and interrelated activities and institutions.
 This is especially evident at the international level where the organization of the collective social life of humanity is rudimentary and fragmentary, though far more complete than it was a few decades ago.
 In spite of the phenomenal growth in global communications, transportation, commerce, finance and tourism, it is still more difficult to carry out most activities internationally than it is domestically, because the international activities are not as well organized.

 “Why?
 He’s going to try to take Seth.

 It’s an understatement to say all hell broke loose.
 In my opinion, it was way crazier than that.
 Kojas sidestepped my arrow and it disappeared somewhere in the trees.
 Emily raised her hands and roots twisted upward, trying to encase Kojas but he kept slashing them away.
 Jason attempted to distract him by running around throwing knives at him but I think Jason was too busy ducking the black stuff that shot out of Kojas’ hands.

 Alec sighed, but it wasn't an angry sigh, so I nodded, forgetting for a moment that he couldn't see me in the darkness.
 "We share a little in common with a bunch of different legends, but none get it quite right.
 In short, we're shape shifters, people who can take the form of animals."
 I'd already seen that for myself, but it was strangely exhilarating to hear him admit it.

The constant consumption of the cocaine by the helpers appeared to be the payment for the effort of assisting in the process.
 People would come and go as they purchased their cocaine all day and all night.
 The big buyers would be treated to a sampling right out of the giant pile.
 Thomas would drag out a “rock” of cocaine from the massive pile and crack it open as if he was cutting a diamond.
 The story of its origin and quality were described as if you were listening to a reading from a science fiction novelist.
 To watch these people hang on every word of his bullshit was sickening to me.
 Their wild eyes and grinding jaws were just the physical part of their bizarre behavior.

 He was unshaven and looked the part of a vagrant.
 We had a moment of eye contact and he had no expression as if he didn’t know me at all.
 It was a slight reassurance but I still wondered where the rest of them were and how they would get to me quick if things went to Hell.
 I received another call from the officer and he had me speak so they could tune in the wire.
 He said that they needed to occasionally check the wire—from time to time I should say something to reassure them that they’d end up with a quality recording of the deal.

 Though I continued to long for Karen Flagstad, I began to roam.
 For some months after meeting Gloria at the San Onofre campground, I frequently drove to South Gate, just south of L.A., a hundred miles each way, to feast on her grandmother’s cooking, get scrutinized by her dad and brothers, take her to drive-in movies and smooch until her midnight curfew, then race home so fast the sleepy cops along Highway 101 failed to notice the blur as I passed.
 But Mexican dads like hers expect their girls’ novios to marry or que se vayan a la fregada.

Increasing incomes among the poorest countries has the greatest multiplier effect on global aggregate demand, because even small increments in per capita income can lead to large increases in the number of households with incomes above the threshold for buying consumer goods.
 Asia is expected to generate half the growth in gross world product and world trade during the 1990s.
 This region will have one billion consumers of televisions, refrigerators and motor vehicles by the year 2000 and a rising appetite for both imported consumer and capital goods.
 East Asia alone, excluding Japan and China, will spend about $900 billion on infrastructure between 1992 and 2000.
 During this decade, China and India will add 21,000 megawatts of electricity generation every year and more telephone switching capacity than the United States and Japan combined.
 Latin America’s annual requirements for investment in power, water and sewage, telecommunications and transport infrastructure are estimated at $60 billion.
 Rising incomes and increasing exports to the dynamic economies of Asia and Latin America could generate as many as 1.7 million jobs by the end of the decade in the United States alone.
 The growth of the developing economies could provide the major impetus for economic expansion and job creation in both developed and developing countries.
 Government policies based on recognition of this fact can considerably improve the climate for development of these nations and correspondingly stimulate further growth in the West.
 Freer international trade will generate a flood of cheaper goods from the developing world that will give rise not only to greater purchasing power and higher standards of living for the Western consumer, but also to a ‘demand boom’ for sophis ticated Western goods and services to improve infrastructure and meet the needs of billions of consumers in developing countries.

“Well done,” Qurrah said.
 “Killing kids is hardly worth a well done.”
 Qurrah frowned as he glanced from his prize to his brother, who sat against a tree, arms on his knees.

 Harruq shrugged.

The Real World
 I started college and rented an apartment with Kenny Niedermeyer who was suffering more than any of us over Eric’s death, since the car was his and Sylvia blamed him.
 She would call and scream “Murderer!” and accuse him of stealing the twenty dollars Eric took with him that day.
 Here's something she wrote and sent him: Jingle for Rope Jumpers Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear, Eric's dead.
 They pushed him, and they beat him and they smashed him in the head.
 He gurgled and he growled, he suffered and he bled.

It would be like I was behaving irresponsibly and taking away her ability to pursue her art, all at the same time.
 It was past time for the bus to arrive, and she still wasn't here.
 A car zipped around the corner driving way too fast, just like Britney always did, but it wasn't white.
 I looked past it, hoping to see another one following it.
 My mouth nearly hit the ground when I recognized the throaty roar and dark paint job of Brandon's Mustang.
 "I knew you'd be sitting here worrying she wouldn't come."
 It took a minute for the words to make sense.
 "Fine, but that doesn't shed any light on why you're all the way out here."
 The gray eyes just visible in the slowly growing light crinkled up in a smile.

All that pity would then make it hard to want to continue fighting, hard to want to do anything other than just curl up in my room so I could avoid them all.
 Rachel shook me gently, apparently not convinced I was mentally where I was supposed to be.
 "Britney's been telling people you collapsed yesterday after school.
 This makes twice in two days, and I know that yesterday wasn't the first time."
 The tired, dreamy remnants of my attack were suddenly burned away as I registered the meaning of what Rachel had just said.
 Vague suspicions that people had known about Jasmin's threats vanished, driven away by the truth that Britney had been gossiping about me just the way she gossiped about everyone else.
 Rachel grabbed my arm as I tensed up.
 "I don't know what you're going to do, but maybe you shouldn't get up yet."
 I looked over at Rachel's concerned face and opened my mouth to thank her for whispering, for keeping my secret, only the words didn't come out.
 Instead the image of Alec, the one that had burned itself onto my retinas a few seconds previously just as it had done in physics when I'd looked over to see his broken pencil, flared back into life before my eyes.

What still caused whispers almost 400 years later was his fate; the All-Father had destroyed him.
 Everyone knew stories of various gods that had challenged Allód over the millennia.
 The punishments he had dealt some were horrible and some simply funny or embarrassing.
 A few times he had even driven Gods to join the fallen Daemon Lords in the Infernal Realm.
 But the All-Father did not kill any of these other challengers.
 It was his duty to support the Pantheon, even when they betrayed him.
 Yet his reaction to this newly created god, this incredibly powerful, magic-wielding new immortal, was to simply kill him; and that was the end of it.
 Centuries later, when the next Guild Master had ascended to the Celestial plane, she kept her ego in sharp check.
 The Sorceress Goddess Blodeuwedd was known for how helpful she was to the rest of the Pantheon, especially Allód.
 Rodregas had always assumed that this had been the point of killing Accerntorino; if mortals where going to become Celestial they would do so on the Celestials terms.

“This isn’t fair,” I complained.
 It seemed he was holding me in place just to strike me.
 “It’s the only way, Freya.
 This is for your protection.” “I highly doubt they will pummel my face with rocks,” I spat out.
 “No,” he said, “they will bind you and burn you alive.” I felt sick.
 A vision of the Grand Council cloaks circling me was convincing enough, but he continued.
 “You will not know their thoughts; you must be ready for any attack.” I nodded, even though part of me was certain there was a less painful way.
 The rock came at me again.
 I couldn’t respond quick enough, couldn’t counter and hold on to a galloping horse in the instant it took him to decide.

Just use your magic.” I tamped down an image of the horse bursting into flames.
 “I haven’t learned animal magic.” His lip pursed, one brow dropping low, the same strange look he’d given the first time I’d mentioned learning magic.
 “Just feel it, Elfreda.” I ignored the slight annoyance that Chevelle must have told him my full name.
 “I don’t understand,” I told him.
 “You don’t learn magic,” Steed said.

While the sword should be fine for his first match, he hoped to be fighting all day today.
 He went forward leading with his round shield.
 He pushed his combatant back with some hard swings.
 Rodregas swung his shield aggressively, he hit the man’s sword with his shield and then banged the other man’s shield hard.
 Rodregas’ goal was to see if he could out muscle the man while staying protected by the shield.
 It worked!
 Clearly his opponent, though set for a heavy blow, was not expecting the strength of Rodregas’ bash.
 Still his opponent was too good to fall, even when surprised.
 And even as he half fell backwards he used the momentum to slide down and try to land a blow low under the shield.
 Rodregas had both quickness and strength on his side.

Mallory's explanation was tickling the back of my mind.
 "Is that why Brandon's unbeatable?"
 "Nobody is unbeatable, but yes, that's why Brandon is such a formidable adversary.
 His gift is more prosaic than most, it's just increased strength and speed, but that makes him more than a match for most normal hybrids."
 "That's why Alec had more food than normal dropped off here then?
 Because he really doesn't think he can win?"
 Mallory pondered for several seconds, before finally shrugging.
 "That may be unduly pessimistic.
 He's detail-oriented enough that part of it's probably just an insurance policy for me in case he doesn't prevail, but there is a kernel of truth to your concern.
 Alec is an incredible fighter, but Brandon's like hasn't been seen in centuries."

Other officers in the van hear my message as it is broadcast over my wire.
 They quickly get the information out and officers both under-cover and uniformed come out of the woodwork and rush around me towards the Starbucks.
 Officer White firmly tells me to “return to home-base now.” The officer’s phone hangs up suddenly.
 I put the truck in reverse and begin to back out amongst the mayhem.
 I notice all of the patrons headed in different directions as the police are yelling for everyone to get down.
 I feel as though I am watching a movie on a screen.
 I don’t even feel like I am a part of it as I begin to pull away, more officers are headed in.
 I look through the Starbucks’ window as I put the car in drive to leave and I can see the commotion in the back as the officers’ drag Ashley out of the bathroom area and toss her to the floor, I am gone.
 I drive to “home base” (behind the grocery store) where all this started so many hours ago.

Alec froze at my appearance, a large planter that easily weighed as much as I did dangling from one hand.
 The shards of pottery strewn about the grotto answered any questions I might have had regarding its imminent fate.
 Neither of us moved for several seconds, and then he turned towards me with a glare.
 "Go away!"
 The command was so forceful it was almost more than I could do to stop myself from turning and running away in terror, but I held my ground.
 "Leave.
 Leave now and I won't follow you."
 The anger was still there, but now there were other emotions, one of which I could identify, one of which I knew how to handle.

Maybe I'd just been overtired, or possibly the strange, symbol on the note, inked into the place where a signature normally would've been, had reminded me of the other truly alien experience so far in my life.
 Whatever the reason, it felt like I'd spent all night on the edge of one of the incredible, vivid dreams.
 I kept catching glimpses of the characteristic soft glow out of the corner of my eye, but hadn't ever actually slipped into a full-blown dream.
 It'd left me feeling very unsatisfied.
 I rolled over and pulled the note out from its hiding place in my dresser.
 I had the words memorized already; the symbol was what I wanted now.
 The note was proof of the existence of our benefactor, but the sigil on the bottom of the page was a clue to his identity.
 It was incredibly intricate and completely different than anything I'd ever seen.
 Once again I traced the sharp edges and smooth swirls with my eyes, marveling at the way it hinted at further complexity lurking just out of sight.
 With a sigh of resignation I hid the note once again and pulled myself out of bed.

Anvil approached next, stepping into the same starting position Grey had used, and Steed shifted several paces back before he readied himself and nodded toward his new opponent.
 I remembered the tree and was suddenly afraid for him.
 Would Anvil use the same method on a person?
 A thunderous crack answered my unspoken question.
 The lightning bolt was faster than my eyes at such a close distance, by the time I looked at Steed, there was nothing but a wall of water.
 He had constructed a barrier of sorts, caught the strike and redirected it around himself by melting the snow that spotted the mountain.
 Anvil was winded, though the strike wasn’t as severe as his previous show.
 Steed would unquestionably be the winner now and as he took aim to retaliate, his opponent raised his hands in surrender.
 “Quick thinking, Mister Summit.” The large man grinned and I was in no doubt they were old friends.
 Chevelle stepped forward then, eager.

Somehow I'd managed to make it through day after day of isolation.
 Brandon's friends continued to more or less ignore me, the boys without the trace of spite that I picked up from most of the girls.
 Britney started another rumor sometime about the middle of the week.
 Apparently I was now some kind of closet drug addict who was hoping to get Brandon to fund my habit.
 Rachel hadn't been back to tutoring since we'd argued, and I was picking up an increasing number of hostile looks from people I didn't even know.
 Some of them were recognizable as Alec's friends, but most of them were just nameless nerds who apparently had a soft spot for Rachel, or a towering hatred for Brandon's friends.

A mage born of power learns to control it at an early age.
 You never had to learn any control; your power was so weak that you always struggled simply to have enough power to do anything with it.” “Ok, I never learned proper control; the spells I learned as a squire were small weak things.
 But, can I learn control now?”  Rodregas asked.
 “Of course,” she responded.
 “But it will probably be harder and slower than if you were learning earlier in life.
 It requires relearning something that is almost an instinct at this point in your life.
 Part of the problem is that the spell to activate the magic in the bow is just very different than anything you have probably done before.” Rodregas knew she was speaking the truth.
 He had never thought he was going to be some powerful mage.
 The fact that Doi’van had so easily learned the spell just reminded him of how many times in his life he had failed to have the ability to succeed in things that he really wanted.
 Rodregas’ new body was very gifted, but it was still mortal and some things he would just not be able to do as well as others.

Though I didn’t understand at the time, I was asking if they felt the darkness in their nature, the affinity for sin.
 Somewhere, I read, "All sin is the result of the failure to love."
 Over lots of years, I have noted voluminous evidence for that idea, and not a shred against it.
 My last summer in Chico, I was sorely depressed, living too far from my family and confused about most everything.
 And I discovered the best I could do to relieve depression was turn my thoughts and concerns from myself to others.
 Even the feeling like a rock in my belly went away.
 Love heals.
 Along with The Practice of the Presence of God and some mysteries, I have been reading about Feodor Dostoyevski's philosophical positions, because the issues he tackled a century and a half ago are still remarkably current.

So around dawn, I rode shotgun while Cliff drove and Lucas Field and Carol Stuhr napped in back.
 We were on Murphy Canyon Road, a two-lane without sidewalks or curbs, bordered by vacant, hilly land.
 I dosed off.
 Then Cliff joined the rest of us.
 The parked station wagon we rammed might've saved our lives, as it kept the convertible from running up the side of a bank and flipping onto our heads.
 The station wagon was wrecked, Bob's Ford was totaled, and the four of us got cited on account of the case of beer in the trunk, which was meant for the beach party.
 Maybe in consideration of it being our prom-night, the police dropped charges on the condition that Cliff agreed to pay off the station wagon owner.
 I offered to split the pay off.
 Cliff and I postponed our move to San Francisco and went looking for work, which we found at Coffee Dan's restaurant in Grossmont Center, a mall we could see from the front yard of my mom's hilltop home.

A bright light flashed and I saw a ghost-like girl disappear in the darkness.
 My eyes widened as I saw Seth and then darkness.
 But not before the voice said one more thing.
 “Beware of each other.” *** I opened my eyes and shot up so fast my head collided with Seth's.
 I clutched my head and said, “Ow.” Seth stretched his arm to rub his eyes.
 “What's wrong?” he asked.

Ignorance and superstition concerning drugs, crime, ethnic and race relations, the environment, health, education, child care, and the life of the elderly demoralize the population and make effective socialaction difficult in these areas.
 These problems can be minimized by educating the public to understand the changes taking place and to adopt appropriate new behaviours.
 Raising awareness internationally
 Public opinion is an even more important determinant at the international level, since the authority of global institutions is still quite limited.
 Rising ethnic and nationalistic sentiments threaten the integrity of states and impede progress toward regional cooperation and global governance in many countries, because their populations lack reliable information regarding the enormous costs of political and economic fragmentation.
 The global debate over the Uruguay Round of GATT has been obscured by lack of clear information regarding its impact on the countries involved.
 International negotiations on debt, aid and the environment are complicated by lack of awareness about the opportunities that greater economic integration will generate for all nations.
 International institutions, non-governmental agencies and the international media play an important role in providing information to the world community, but there are still huge gaps to be filled in all fields.
 A conscious and systematic effort is required at the international level to put in place both the institutions and the technology for information superhighways needed to support peace, democracy and sustainable development in the twenty-first century.

 "Don't worry.

“And now you’ve killed one.” But I didn’t know who had killed him.
 Anvil had stood before the man, but any one of them could have snapped his spine.
 “Frey.” Chevelle’s tone was solemn.
 “You know what they did to your mother.” And I could hear what he didn’t say.
 You know what they’ll do to you.
 I didn’t have a counter for that and he knew it.
 He took advantage of the silence, giving orders to Ruby.
 “Take her to the house.” She had me at once, towing me beside her as she retrieved our cloaks.
 Chevelle was still instructing, “Steed, watch the front, stay inside.

When he looked to the stars, he saw Aurelia’s face among them.
 He tried not to think of what she’d say if she knew what he had done.
 Guilt and regret meant nothing so he choked it down.
 It didn’t matter what he wanted.
 His oath was made.
 His swords had swung.
 The weight of blood was on his shoulders, and who was he to fight against it?

Mrs. Campbell didn't seem like the kind of teacher you could get away with ignoring, so I retrieved an algebra book from the back of the room and sat at my desk.
 Any thoughts about finding out why hiking was off limits quickly melted away once class started.
 Math had never been my favorite subject.
 I'd always managed to pull A's or at least A-'s, but hated all of the little nitpicky rules.
 Unfortunately, after missing a whole month of classes, I was at least as bad off in Algebra as I was in Biology.
 Mrs. Campbell was solving problems with so many variables in them it was like watching alphabet soup spontaneously re-arrange itself on her overhead projector.
 Not only that, things were being squared and cubed, an operation with which I had only passing familiarity.
 I struggled valiantly to understand what was going on.
 I got the sense the operations being applied to the formulas were being explained very well, I just didn't have the vocabulary to follow what she was saying.
 By the time class finally ended I was fighting not to become emotional.

Ruby answered, “Hmm,” with a cocked eyebrow as she turned to follow the group.
 They were mostly silent the rest of the day, until we stopped for the night.
 The group split after dinner as Anvil and Grey positioned themselves on rocks at the perimeter of our camp.
 Ruby hung out by Grey and Steed busied himself as Chevelle paced stiffly around the camp.
 I was bored again, with everyone entertaining themselves, so I leaned back against a rock and pulled my pack to my lap.
 I wrapped my cloak loosely around me and positioned my legs so I could place the book there and, hopefully, not be found out.
 I wondered how many more days of traveling we’d have.
 I didn’t see a peak—didn’t even know if we were going to the peak of the mountain we were on—but I was too cowardly to ask, to think about what had happened, so I distracted myself in the journal.

“For what reason do we fight?” she asked.
 “For what reason do you harbor this hatred?”
 He glared.
 “I told you.

The veracity of the following has been called into question.
 That the people who would know, the people who were actually there, all three voices heard here, are all dead makes proving it somewhat difficult.
 Buddy Gardner died, famously, of a heroin/pill/alcohol overdose;   Lorelei Enos died only a few years ago by her own hand, after an incident, which was kept out of the papers because of the famous talk show host involved.
 And, Creole Myers, the interviewer, died just last year of cancer.
 But, if you listen, that is, if you can read between the lines here, you’ll find, not only an extraordinary document, but one that could only come from the personalities involved.
 The voices are theirs.
 The story is theirs, even as it belongs to a generation.
 Let us hearken back, briefly, to those days when music was being made because it was important, because genius finds its own level, because people needed godhead, if that’s not overstating it.

I could only think of one thing: Fight fire with fire.
 I flung my arm toward the incoming stream of flames and a tongue of fire akin to a dragon’s shot out and collided with it.
 I was shocked.
 I’d only used my power to light candles and lanterns.
 I’d had no idea I could produce such a vicious plume of flames.
 I looked to Chevelle.
 “Yes,” he exalted.
 He raised his arms above his head to construct a massive circle of blazing heat.
 When his eyes returned to mine, he smiled.
 He liked playing with fire.

In January 1994, the government embarked on a comprehensive monetary reconstruction programme to achieve price and exchange rate stability; to remove administrative controls over production, investment, prices, salaries, and interest rates; to re-establish the role of the central bank in monetary stability; to reorganize public finances through an efficient tax system, including more efficient tax collection and better coverage of the lage `grey' economy; to reduce government administrative and defence expenditure to the maximum possible extent; to maintain price supports for important agricultural commodities as an incentive for production; to stimulate economic activities of private, cooperative and public sector enterprises through equal access to credit and government facilities; and to encourage the takeover of sick firms by stronger, more efficient companies.
 At the same time, the programme was intended to mitigate the harsher effects of shock therapy programme was intended to mitigate the harsher effects of shock therapy programmes on the working class and fixed-income pensioners by providing free scope for collective bargaining, enforcement of a minimum wage policy and a social safety net for the unemployed.
 It was recognized from the outset that stability of the currency was an absolute precondition for the success of the reform programme, which depended in turn on the firmness and consistency with which it was implemented.
 The central element of the programme was the introduction of a new currency, the `superdinar', in parallel to the existing currency, but without demonetizing or confiscating it.
 Inspired by an experiment in the Soviet Union during the 1920s, the value of the new currency was tied to that of the Deutsche Mark and made fully convertible without restriction.
 Based on the country's very limited foreign currency reserves, new issues of the currency were to be utilized primarily to inject real purchasing power into the economy, revive demand and stimulate production, while covering the government's budget deficit during an initial six-month period needed for sufficient recovery.
 In this way the foreign currency and gold reserves were used as a buffer to moderate contraction of the money supply and avoid the shock usually accompanying such efforts.
 Issuing of the old dinar was stopped, but it remained in circulation as legal tender.
 An interest rate of six per cent was established for the superdinar - the first real, positive interest rate in years - to make holding the new currency an attractive alternative to hoarding goods or foreign exchange.
 It had been widely anticipated by foreign experts that this strategy would result in an immediate run on the country's foreign reserves and thereby a collapse of the new currency's foundation.

Outsourcing: During the last decade enormous attention has been focused on the lucrative employment potentials generated by Information and Communication Technology (ICT), particularly the high paid jobs in computer software and hardware and the less technical jobs in business process outsourcing.
 Countries such as India have shown that they can leapfrog into the technological vanguard by developing qualified human resources to meet the ever-expanding shortage in these sectors.
 Information Technology and IT-enabled services stand out as the most important new fields of employment to emerge since the popularization of the automobile.
 While the Commission’s report anticipated the importance of the information superhighway even before the World Wide Web radically transformed global communications, information exchange and commerce, ICPF did not foresee the dramatic impact that the Internet would have on the future export of service jobs to developing countries.
 The West has been exporting manufacturing jobs in large numbers for half a century, fuelling the growth of Japan, the East Asia tigers, and more recently China; but until the emergence of the information superhighway, the scope for export of service jobs was limited.
 Technological development has changed that.
 As a result, business process outsourcing has become one of the fastest growing sectors of the world economy.
 As growth of the labour force slows in high-income countries, there will be increasing pressure for export of service jobs.
 Public concern in the West over the rapid growth of outsourcing is fuelled by the common misconception that employment is a zero sum game.
 A recent authoritative study of the impact of IT outsourcing found that the direct gains to the US economy in the form of additional jobs in other fields, higher real wages, higher real GDP growth, contained inflation and expanded exports far outweigh the losses.

We drove to a party, and told nobody about Billy Graham.

I looked over my shoulder to see if Emily and Jason were coming but both of them stared at me, baffled.
 Their faces disappeared as I was swallowed by the trees.

 I didn’t see any trace of where Seth could have ran.
 That shows how much I know about asking questions.
 I don’t get the answers and boom; I lose it and become a demanding person.
 I walked more slowly, watching the trees.
 I sent a silent prayer that Seth hadn’t entered Igneeria, because then I would never find him.
 What bugged me the most was that Seth didn’t fight me when I pushed him down.
 He just sat on the ground not saying anything at all in his own defense.

For a second nothing made sense.
 Brandon was the one who was saving us, and if that wasn't out of the ordinary, I didn't know what would be.
 Only he'd said in his note not to say anything to anyone.
 Of course.
 He was testing me, making sure I was going to keep quiet about what he'd done.
 Probably because he didn't want any of the praise for such a selfless act.

As he followed Doi’van into the shadows of the distant arch Rodregas smelled what had attracted Doi’van, the odor of brimstone and hellfire.
 Rodregas stepped back in shock; what was that smell of the Infernal Realm doing here in the Cathedral of the Heavens?
 Doi’van however, did not step back but stepped forward, reaching out to the stone.
 When he touched it, suddenly there was a doorway.
 It was the twin of the main entrance, except here there were no guards.
 Doi’van reached for the long handle, but Rodregas quickly said, “Stop!” Doi’van looked back at him and Rodregas could see that he was under no magical geis controlling his will, just curiosity of what the source of the Infernal smell was down here.
 But what Doi’van said to him was, “Where is Imeralda?” At these words Rodregas whirled around and looked around throughout the great chamber.
 Both of their eyes were drawn to where they heard a third door being opened.
 As they had found a door smelling of the fires of hell, so apparently had Imeralda found a door.

 When the creature went down, Seth stood and took a breath.
 Then another tackled him to the ground.

“So how did it go?” He relaxed a little but his mood didn’t rise in the least.
 “We shall see.” “Indeed,” she purred.
 “Indeed.” He didn’t look back at me as he left the room, simply directing Ruby to take me with her when she’d finished.
 She seemed more than happy to comply and I was in no doubt we would be training again.
 I slid the hawk sculpture into my pocket.
 She hummed as she gathered, throwing a cloak at me in the process.
 I tied it on and drew the hood up.
 “Want me to carry anything?” She eyed me as if I was entirely absurd.
 “Well, if you would like to, I can find something for you.” I glared at her back and she turned to grab my arm beneath the cloak, yanking me behind her as we left the house through her closet.

Brandon and his friends left through one set of cafeteria doors, while Alec and his friends departed through the other.
 Britney looked like she was trying to decide whether to be mad or impressed, but I felt too sick to stick around and try to nudge her in either direction.
 I mumbled something I hoped sounded intelligible and headed towards the bathroom.
 I passed Mr. Simms and another teacher on my way out, but apparently I looked as awful as I felt.
 They just shot me stern looks rather than stopping me to ask what had happened.
 It wasn't until I'd finished dry-heaving and was trying to clean myself back up, that I wondered where they'd been.
 The school building wasn't that big.
 If they'd really been trying to break up the fight, they should have arrived minutes earlier.

He had taken in the essence of the Celestial Lion back at Raven Keep, and now Rodregas would consume his own magical power with the greater sigil of a Celestial Lion and become a perfect vessel for its power.
 Rodregas forced himself to step back.
 This was their chance for Doi’van, and he would get a second chance if needed.
 He looked over at the other two.
 Once Rodregas had turned around from the lion, Doi’van started to walk between the pedestals joining Imeralda at looking around.
 He stood in front of the great six-legged stallion, the kind of steed the Gods themselves ride, and then walked over to the Great White Stag of the forest and then to the giant eagle that guarded the Celestial sky.
 It was a sight to take the breath from any mortal, a score of beasts that appeared to have been taken right from the heavens.
 “How were the greater sigils created?” Rodregas wondered.

I demand two lives for the two lives robbed me."
 Brandon's expression was confident and a little smug, and I somehow didn't doubt in the slightest that he'd expected Alec to calmly hand over two people to be executed.
 Alec hadn't even flinched at the demand.
 "Your wolves were lawbreakers who were executed before they could break further laws.
 The protection of the people, of the secrets that guard our nature from the dayborn, represents a law that supersedes any question of territory or dominance."
 The energy suddenly rolling off of the gathered shape shifters nearly drove me to my knees as Alec continued.
 "By their actions Adriana Paige learned of our nature, and it was only by the grace of the Maker that I was able to stop them from killing her.
 Their deaths were an unavoidable price to save an innocent."
 Some of the faces across the circle from me flinched a little, and I had a moment to wonder if Brandon hadn't told them the truth about what'd happened.
 "Her life belonged to me, it was mine to dispose of as I saw fit."

 Emily moved her hand over and the ice evaporated into mist.

 Still, I couldn't help envy such contentment.

It would not be smart to make the Guild Dealer wait for even a moment.
 The Guild Dealer Taiga was not such a common man that he did his work from a desk; his desires and commands came during parties and social events.
 However, if you were truly honored, though personal invitations to dine with him in his personal solar overlooking his city you would get told his wishes.
 As Van’dret stepped through the arch he was struck by the bare simplicity of the solar.
 The city known as the Menagerie of Sky, Earth and Water that Taiga ruled and had created over the centuries was a lush place, full of pleasures and growing things.
 Anything that could be found in the world was said to be found within its gleaming walls and exotic gardens.
 However, the private place where it’s Master worked, was a stark contrast.
 It’s marble columns and arched ceiling spoke of simply sophistication and understated power, and much more accurately reflected the nature of its owner than the over the top shows and pleasures of the Menagerie.
 Two small intricate waterfalls softly trickled down each side wall to the, providing a soft soothing sound.
 The back of the room was an archway leading to the terrace, overhead the incredible crystal ceiling let in the natural daylight of the late afternoon sun and would illuminate the top of the tower under its own power during the night.

Knowing which way they would walk to the office from their auto shop class, around behind the football field, I took that route.
 The teacher was engaged with a carburetor and didn’t notice me trespassing in his class.
 I found Billy and Cliff wearing goggles, huddled over the head to a Chevy, grinding the valves.
 They had decided Mrs. Bole and whatever trouble they were in could wait.
 They had one more valve to grind.

I saw Jason hide behind his tree again.
 One dwarf got too close to Emily and she raised her arms, dousing him in flames.
 He screeched and fell to the ground, withering and then went still.
 Seth ran from the trees, brandishing his sword.
 He swung it around and clashed with one of the faery's swords.
 The faery brought the other around and Seth twisted to avoid it.
 He grabbed the blade and flung it out of the man's arms.
 He roared angrily and threw his sword down on Seth, who raised his up to block it.
 Seth pushed back, but I could see him shaking.
 Right when I thought he was winning, my mouth dropped open.

"But have you?"
 "No."
 She laughed.
 "Come on--let's go do it."
 He hadn't considered the fact that the water hose would be a new toy for her.
 "Time to rinse, Marie."
 "OK.  Look--it's making a rainbow!"
 Smiling, he shook his head.
 "See if it'll make a rainbow on the car."
 "Good idea."

A false promise.
 Eventually, one of the servants slipped, revealing they had seen me following my sister.
 And just like that, she was to blame for the entire ordeal, even though she’d never known.
 She’d been still searching the empty camp.
 At least I was off the hook.
 I surprised myself by being so slow.
 Of course, her sister would have been Aunt Fannie.
 For a flash, I felt sympathy for Fannie… but it passed.
 Just because life had given her sour grapes didn’t mean she had to stomp them into wine and get drunk.
 Had Fannie known all along?

The need for secrecy, always stressed in the Cold War period, has been superseded by the need for openness.
 6.An international system should be instituted by the UN to assist in the transfer of environmentally beneficial technology, as recommended by the Royal Society and the United States National Academy of Sciences, both from the developed to the less-developed nations, and from the military to the non-military sectors.
 This applies in particular to the field of information technology, where there is scope for dual use of existing military capabilities.
 Closer links should be established between research and development teams in the military and civilian sectors at the national level.
 7.A greater degree of regional cooperation is desirable between states which share natural resources and common environmental interests.
 This is of particular importance where regional peace and stability is at stake, as in the Middle East, over the question of access to water supplies.
 Where national environmental resources may lead to dispute and conflict, agreements should be drawn up between potential belligerents and the good offices of the UN's specialized agencies used to anticipate and avert future conflict.
 Peace and democracy can provide only the foundation for stable and productive social life, not its fulfilment.
 For that, political security has to be complemented by economic security and a blossoming of individual and cultural potentials.
 Yet here our optimism seems to flag.

Qurrah accepted the bones, stashing them into a small pocket he had sewn onto his robe.
 A silence fell over the two as far away a wolf howled.
 “I wonder,” Velixar said, gazing in the direction of the howl.
 “Do you have a brother?”
 Qurrah shifted his weight a bit.
 “Why do you ask?”
 Velixar looked up to the moon and stared as he spoke.
 “I have had dreams.

The one on my back grabbed my hair.
 He yanked it back.
 “Ow!
 It may be green but I still value it!” I grumbled, trying to pull my head free.
 I also had no desire to be bald at 16.
 “He’s rising, he’s rising!” The dwarf said excitedly.
 His voice cracked at the last word.
 “Who the heck is rising and why does it require pulling my hair out!” I snapped.
 “He’s rising, he’s rising!” he repeated, full of crazed excitement.
 I swear I could feel him shaking from exhilaration.

They turned to me as Rhys and Rider entered.
 They didn’t approach but stopped just inside the room and dipped into a bow.
 “Our gratitude, Elfreda.” I blushed.
 I had forgotten the wolves.
 They must have found them.
 “Were they hurt?” “No.
 And our thanks to you for that as well.” I wasn’t exactly sure how that was due to me, but I smiled, glad they had found them and everyone was safe.
 They turned to leave and Grey entered with two spits of meat and wine.
 It almost seemed like a celebration.

Don't get specific on any details, and you can ride this all the way until you graduate."
 The mask was gone, she wasn't lying anymore.
 She really believed this rumor would change everything for the better.
 It all made sense, but didn't explain who'd started it, or why they'd done it.
 Rachel's face told me she wouldn't answer either of those questions.
 I finally settled on one I thought she might answer.
 "Why are you telling me all this?"
 Rachel's face tried to take on her liar's mask, but didn't quite succeed.

But that was before.
 I wasn’t sure how the magic had worked with the bird, but I knew it had, so I dropped to my knees, held my hands above the stone, and closed my eyes, concentrating with everything I had.
 Nothing happened right away, and my mind wandered a bit with thoughts of what might be inside, how I wanted to see and needed to touch my family heirlooms.
 The things that belonged to my mother.
 The stone lid scraped across the floor as it shifted.
 It didn’t go far, but I hadn’t needed much.
 I reached down and drew out a small leather pouch, its bronzed decorations weathered and worn.
 I laid it aside, reaching back in.
 My fingers closed around a tube, probably a scroll case.
 I had started to take it out when I heard the wheezing growl behind me.

The land was hill after hill, tree after tree.
 It didn’t seem to end.
 “Hey, I’m king of the hill,” Seth joked and reached for the sky.
 I walked over and pushed him gently.
 He fell backward on his butt and I laughed.
 “More like goof of the hill.” He stuck his tongue out.
 “You’re just jealous.” “Of what?” I asked.
 “What do you have that would make me jealous.” “Uh…” he stumbled.
 “I don’t know, that’s what you usually say in this type of situation.” I laughed.
 “Then what happens?” “I don’t know.” Seth whipped out his leg and tripped me.

He'll find a way to get you to come to him instead of him coming to you.
 The girl had told us more than we had thought.
 Maybe Kojas thought we would both imagine that he did something to the other two so that we would come running to him.
 I had a feeling that Emily and Jason were okay and just as confused as us.
 That also meant that Kojas knew as much, and maybe more than us.
 *** Emily pushed herself into sitting position, ignoring the sharp pains in her elbows and knees.
 Jason was leaning against a tree nearby, tossing a knife from hand to hand.
 She saw a deep, red scratch on his left cheek and the way he winced every time he moved his right arm, she could tell she must have injured it.
 “Do you know where the others are?” she asked him.
 He shook his head.

I knew the way pot smelled, so it wasn’t any great detective work that led me to it.
 Soon after this, we discovered he had obtained a license to obtain medical marijuana.
 I was surprised.
 Turns out, it’s legal for my child (and yours) to buy, possess and grow pot and the only requirement is that they want it!
 Any little shithead can get a “medical” license to smoke marijuana in California when he turns 18.
 In fact, it’s a rite of passage, even more than a drivers’ license nowadays.
 The students hand around a list of unscrupulous doctors who are willing to do a consultation for a fee and then write a prescription for a fee so your child can go to some legal dope dispensary and buy all the “sticky-icky green bud” he or she wants.
 They don’t need a parent to sign, they just need to recite from a passed-around list of symptoms as to why they need this marijuana when they show up to this farce of a doctor’s appointment.
 Apparently half of the high school has obtained this license to smoke pot and can buy the strongest pot available, legally.
 I went and got one for myself—as an experiment—and was astonished at how easy it was.

And the first thing you know I’m getting handjobs in the girl’s bathroom.
 Cute girls, too, not just the trashy ones.

 I think my first blowjob was on the school playground, off in a corner, where there was this big bush.
 Cathy Ceccerelli.
 Man, she was hot, I mean for a thirteen year old.
 Great braids that hung on either side of her face.
 And the first girl in our class to get tits.

 "I'm not angry, Mother, but you're wrong.

 She shook her head with a youthful smile.

But here you were, thinking about me!"
 "I haven't stopped thinking about you."
 And when he'd read the pages about her and realized they hadn't changed, he'd wondered if maybe it was because she hadn’t stayed in 1927, had come back to 2011.
 Or rather, would come back to 2011.

Maybe it’ll re-emerge as an acoustic ballad.

 Of course, the bluesman.

They all turned back to the door and started filing out again, but by tomorrow half the school would know exactly how badly I'd just been humiliated.
 I found myself just outside the tutor lab with no recollection of having stumbled to my locker, or going by Physics to grab the stuff I'd left there.
 Still, somehow my Spanish book had disappeared, replaced by my math book.
 My knees started shaking as I entered the room, but I made it safely to my normal table before they gave out.
 "Adri, Adriana?
 Excuse me."
 I didn't recognize the girl standing across from me, but based on her uncomfortable expression and the fact that more than one person had turned for the sole purpose of watching us out of the corner of their eyes, she'd been standing there longer than I'd realized.
 Apparently my looking up was enough of a response for her to proceed.

“We will not,” Qurrah said.
 “How will I know where this Ahrqur lives?”
 “I will show you, my disciple, but first I have a gift for my dearest bone general.”
 Velixar drew out his magical chest.
 He set it beside him and let it grow out to normal size.
 From within he pulled out a suit of armor stained a deep shade of black.
 He threw it to Harruq, who managed to catch it even though his mouth hung wide open.
 “The first Horde War was caused by a disciple of mine,” the man in black explained.
 “He blessed the armor of one of the leaders of the orcish clans.

Rachel met me outside the door, her face lit up with a smile even more striking than her usual expression.
 "You won.
 I'm so excited that you won.

 Life couldn't get any better.
 I was going to Les Misérables with Rachel, and I only had two more hours before Brandon would be taking me home.

To Rodregas’ relief no one was paying them any attention, not even to Doi’van.
 Rodregas and Doi’van did their best to block the view of others as Imeralda gathered the limp pale hand that should have belonged to an old man, not a young one, and slipped the small frog figurine into it.
 Quickly she channeled the power.
 Rodregas could feel the instinctive rise of the young man’s own power.
 Then the squire started to squirm weakly in pain.
 Both Doi’van and Rodregas reached out and steadied the young man until it was over.
 Imeralda straightened the sheets for the young squire.
 She then led Rodregas and Doi’van to the figure of a woman.
 She was short and muscular and older than average for the tournament.
 Her bed was more exposed and Rodregas could feel the attention of one of the healers.

 As soon as he'd touched me everything else ceased to matter.
 "Once upon a time the Sun and the Earth loved each other.
 So much so that the Sun sent her children down to live upon the Earth's face."
 I was relaxing so quickly that I wasn't sure how much longer I would be able to stay awake, but his story was already different than any other I'd heard, and I resolved I wasn't going to miss any of it.
 As long as he was willing to talk I was going to fight off sleep.

He stared at me as if I were a delusion, a dream looking back at him.
 He was speechless and it occurred to me that perhaps elves were not a part of this human’s knowledge.
 I wondered if he would recover soon.
 I considered abandoning him and returning to watch the others, but his face was so interesting, the emotions so plain and readable there.
 But he wasn’t afraid.
 It was awe.
 I decided to have a little fun with him.
 They couldn’t possibly be dangerous.

 He merely stood gawking at me.

We were evasive when we called my wife’s parents to tell them not to come to our house as they usually did.
 We said we had some personal family issues to deal with.
 We could tell their feelings were hurt, but we didn’t feel we had any other choice.
 We did allow my younger brother Harry in on the whole awful situation and invited him to come to the house as planned.
 I needed my younger brother because he had developed a great relationship with my boys.
 He’s 11 years younger than me, and in the music business where he works shooting videos for rap artists my sons listen to.
 He has had a solid relationship with both of our boys and that could translate into communication.
 This Thanksgiving we had an agenda that didn’t include turkey and all the trimmings.

When she was less happy with me, she tended to focus more on just how stubborn I could be.
 It wasn't always obvious what would set off a bout of 'stiff neck' as she referred to it, but the only people who'd ever successfully talked me into a 'reasonable, rational' response had been Dad and Cindi.
 I could feel that same core of iron making its presence known right now.
 I wasn't going to be deprived of however much time I had left with him.
 I wasn't going to be losing this argument.
 "Alec, I need to be there with you tonight.

We walked inside the dimly lit space and I sighed in relief at some safety.
 The air smelled musty and I had a feeling no one had ever been here.
 I sat on the floor next to Emily and the boys sat on the opposite side of the floor.
 “We should all get some rest,” Seth said with a yawn.
 “We can figure out what to do next when we wake up.” I nodded sleepily and laid down on the hard ground.
 I closed my eyes, feeling a strange tiredness come over me.
 I barely heard Seth mumbled, “I don't like our situation at all.” That night, I had the weirdest dream.
 I was standing on a dark cliff, the eerie moon high in the sky.
 The wind whipped at my hair, causing me to see the green strands in front of my eyes.
 The cold nipped at my cheeks and nose, which I tried to rub back to warmth.

An effective international judicial system is vitally important to the expanded role contemplated for the UN in dealing with arms and drugs trafficking, terrorism and crimes against humanity.
 This requires, as a minimum step, either that the International Court of Justice be granted mandatory jurisdiction over such cases by member states, or that an International Criminal Court be established with jurisdiction over these offences and other crimes under international law, thus strengthening both the preventive and enforcement capabilities of the international community against non-traditional threats to security.
 Alternative Use of Military Resources
 National and international security can no longer be conceived in narrow military terms.
 Ethnic conflict, drugs, environmental degradation and pollution, famine leading to civil unrest or massive migrations of refugees, high levels of unemployment, urban crime and violence constitute threats to both social stability and the preservation of a productive material base.
 Curbing drug traffic, preventing nuclear and chemical contamination, stopping soil degradation and deforestation, augmenting food production capabilities in deficit areas – all directly and substantially contribute to the security of society.
 The attention given to the anticipated monetary savings from reduced military spending has directed attention away from the potential benefits of utilizing other resources controlled by the military for addressing these threats to security, particularly for the alleviation of poverty, protection and restoration of the environment, and management of natural disasters.
 The military possesses a vast array of resources – human, educational, scientific and technological, medical, organizational and logistical; in training, in engineering and production, in communication and transportation, in construction, land and housing – that can be employed to meet non-military security challenges.
 Many of these resources can be utilized for these purposes without necessarily removing them from military control.
 Especially in many developing countries, the organizational and managerial capabilities of the military far exceed those of other agencies and represent a precious resource for addressing these other security threats.

tential benefits of utilizing other resources controlled by92m the0m92m military0m for addressing these other security challenges is to reduce the numbers of military troops92m.0m This requires a significant reduction in military spending92m in0m the form of increased military92m personnel0m.

Maybe I just lacked the maturity to appreciate Bronte's so-called masterpiece, but I couldn't stand that her characters were almost all really nasty people.
 I wondered what else we'd be reading.
 I could always ask Britney, but the odds of her knowing anything useful seemed pretty slim.
 When the bell finally released us from an analysis of Heathcliff's early depravity, Britney asked what my next class was.
 She was elated to find we were both headed to Algebra.
 As we trailed the other students out of the class, I wasn't so sure I was equally enthused.
 Nobody had said anything to either of us.

Rodregas was surprised to find a pile of equipment outside his door the next morning, and Imeralda sorting through the pile.
 It appeared to be mostly their equipment plus miscellaneous pieces of slaver gear.
 Doi’van stood watching, clearly not sure what to make of it.
 When Rodregas tried to apologize Imeralda ignored him and instead said, “We traded the Immortal Guard equipment for safe harbor here at the village for healing.
 But, of course, there were also regular slaver guards and I claimed their equipment and any money that was in their personal money pouches.” “Your armor got pretty chopped up,” she continued, “and Doi’van did not have any armor to start with.
 I have been trading excess gear and coins to repair armor and to refit some of the other armor to fit Doi’van and yourself.
 We still had our three horses, but none of them were too great to begin with; the two were good for pulling carriages, the other was too old.” “True,” Rodregas said nodding his agreement.
 “Jordaan knows horse flesh,” she went on, “and we were able to trade the three old horses for one of the Immortal Guards’ horses.
 I will be honest, he is a big ugly brute and not war trained and his Dire blood is marginal.
 But Jordaan thinks he can actually handle Doi’van’s weight.

She smiled at her mother over her teacup.
 "Then why are you considering a September wedding?"
 "I think he'll propose soon.

 Mrs. Tranton managed to maintain a pensive expression for a few seconds but then smiled at her daughter.
 "Yes.
 And I think a September wedding would be perfect."
 They discussed bridesmaids and flowers and gardens.
 Marie would wear her mother's wedding gown, which had been carefully stored away for the last 28 years.

The devastating effect of even conventional weapons on economic activity and society in general is so great that today no developed nation can afford the costs of military confrontation, either at home or overseas.
 No longer can non-combatants sit quietly on the sidelines or work productively undisturbed.
 War both between and within states has come to involve and affect all of society.
 Infrastructure and production facilities have become a principal target of military action.
 Food supplies are frequently the first major casualty and most lethal weapon.
 A single explosion can paralyze a major metropolis or contaminate an entire region with toxic material, dwarfing the devastation caused by the industrial accidents at Chernobyl and Bhopal.
 The disruption of trade resulting even from regional conflicts such as the Gulf War or the war in Bosnia, impacts not only on the economies of the belligerents, but also on neighbours, trading partners and global economic performance.
 Neither the victor nor the victim can any longer afford to resolve conflicts violently.
 Political states may still be able to survive wars, but developmental achievements can not.
 So long as the benefits of development are confined to one or a few sections of society, the costs of militarization and war may not prevent economic and social progress.

Peace was accompanied by partial economic collapse in Eastern Europe.
 It was evident from the outset that the transition in these countries would not be smooth or easy and that the destiny of the world in the twenty-first century would be influenced decisively by the outcome.
 Severe food shortages in the Soviet Union, which angered the long-suppressed population and compelled the government to take radical action, once again highlighted the linkages between peace and food.
 Production dropped precipitously as frantic efforts were made to reverse economic decline by radical measures.
 Although these events were closely observed and strongly assisted by top international experts, the world lacked both the conceptual knowledge and the practical experience needed to guide these nations through their crisis.
 At the invitation of the Soviet Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Commission's next meeting, in November 1990, was held in Moscow: it would examine the challenges facing the USSR during the shift to democracy and a civilian market economy, and identify steps to improve the food supply, speed military conversion and ease the economic transition.
 The immediate euphoria over the rapid reduction in tensions between East and West freed public attention to focus on other pressing problems and generated great expectations that a 'peace dividend' would usher in a period of rapid economic progress for developing countries.
 Yet, despite a remarkable one-third reduction in worldwide defence spending from peak levels in the 1980s, foreign aid budgets continued to shrink.
 This prompted us to examine the potential benefits that could be derived from transferring or redirecting scientific, technological, educational and productive resources from military applications to support development and the environment.
 At the same time, increasing pressure was mounted by donors on aid-dependent developing countries to reduce their own defence spending, often with out consideration for the genuine security concerns of these countries.

It must take the necessary steps to effect a peaceful92m transition0m.<eop><eod> Another92m example0m is92m the0m belief that it is a good thing for everyone to92m be0m92m ways0m to help others in their life.

Sure enough he was on the ground like he had dropped a few feet and not a hundred.
 Doi’van looked at them; he seemed amused and with a deep laugh of his own made a big show of jumping off the root he was standing on.
 The few feet of his jump seemed to lack any magical qualities.
 “So, other than making the most memorable snack of my life, you say this was the equivalent of a greater sigil for the Elemental realm.
 So, am I stronger, faster or what?” Doi’van asked.
 Imeralda shrugged and said, “No.
 You are more, well, I think the only way to describe it is more nymph-like.
 There are tales of eating the blessings of the One Tree, most of the greatest Nymphs of our history all claim this.
 A Forest Nymph simply becomes more connected to the forest, and some also claim to gain more than one elemental power.

 Some people claimed to have traveled into the past, but they had no real proof.
 If these scientists were so interested in time travel and believed they'd gone into the past, wouldn't they have known about people like her, people who'd come from the past into the future--their present?

That in turn helped me remember that most relationships seemed to be more fuss and mess than they were worth.
 Why get something built up so much in your mind that you can't possibly ever realize it?
 All of the little things about Valentine's Day that grounded me in reality were overcome by the mystique of Prom.
 Instead of people fighting, there were dozens, sometimes even hundreds, of couples who all seemed to be very much in love.
 Everyone got to dress up and go dancing in a place that'd been transformed into another world.
 Even before I'd gotten old enough to attend Prom, I'd still invariably spent the day grouchy and depressed.
 Things only got worse as I'd aged, presumably because I wasn't really as indifferent as I liked to pretend, and I couldn't hide behind the excuse of being too young to be asked anymore.
 My pulse had already skyrocketed; I almost didn't hear what Rachel was saying over the pounding in my ears.
 "...of course it's still a little ways away, but a girl like Britney starts early so she gets as high up the social food chain as possible."

It had been a hard day.
 I'd....actually I wasn't sure why it'd been a hard day, but something told me I'd unconsciously been at the end of my rope just before I'd collapsed.
 Unfortunately that same thing told me I couldn't dwell here in the comforting absence, there was a very important reason for me to regain my feet.
 The void was reluctant to let me go, stripping me of memories and experiences as I fought my way free.
 By the time I was near surfacing I no longer remembered just how much I'd wanted to stay.
 Britney was pacing back and forth when I opened my eyes.
 She had her cell phone out and was looking like she wanted to dial 911, but was worried about the possible fallout.
 I was on the ground, which for some reason made me more irritable than it should have.
 Didn't she realize how hard it was to make it over to someone before collapsing like that?
 It kind of defeated the whole point if they then put you on the ground where your clothes would take their normal, instantaneous-collapse beating.

The Commission's fourth plenary meeting in Oslo during September 1992 focused on the issues of employment and transition.
 Our effort to examine each of these problems, both in depth and in relation to each other, was aided by the constitution of six working groups to study a wide gamut of issues related to peace, disarmament, food, employment and human development in the emerging global context.
 This report is based upon the findings and recommendations of these groups, which were presented and discussed during the fifth and final plenary meeting at the Carter Presidential Center in Atlanta in October 1993.
 This narrative of ICPF's brief history illustrates the complex array of interrelationships that link the issues of peace, social stability, disarmament, democracy and environment with economic transition in the East, employment in the West and poverty elimination and population stabilization in developing countries.
 The necessity for understanding and addressing these issues as a complex whole rather than as disparate and independent parts has been an underlying principle of our work.
 From the outset, it has been our intention to build upon the work of previous international commissions that have done so much to generate greater public awareness and support for coordinated global action.
 This report contains specific operational strategies for implementing many of their recommendations.
 Much of their work can come to fruition in the changed international climate, if only we shift the emphasis from preoccupation with cataloguing the problems to focusing on the opportunities available to eliminate them.
 The work of an independent, self-constituted commission has the advantage of being unfettered by the necessity of conforming to any official policy lines.
 It is also faced with the challenge of making a real further contribution on issues which engage so many excellent minds and institutions world wide.

I felt the tears start again as I realized all that goodness and joy was gone from my life forever.
 As my immunity started to wear off, I gratefully surrendered to the next attack, and the blissful relief it represented.
 I knew I was on track to drop back into the funk that'd robbed me of the weeks immediately after they died, but I was still strangely numb in the parts that should have cared.
 It seemed like I was on my third iteration, but it might have been the fourth or fifth.
 I was too detached to care.
 The knock on the door at least brought me back to myself enough to wonder how long I'd been on the floor.
 My ankle hurt so bad, it was all I could do to get myself standing and then hobble the fifteen feet to the door.
 When I finally managed to get the door open and found empty space where there should have been a person, I almost swore.
 Then I saw the incredibly beautiful rose on our porch.
 I picked it up, trimmed the bottom inch or so off with a knife, and got it into some water acting out of nothing more than pure habit.

I was alone in her bed, but could hear an exchange of low whispers from the open door as she and Steed conversed in the front room.
 I wasn’t about to announce I had woken.
 My head didn’t throb as before, no sour mouth.
 It was overall a much better experience.
 But who could stand the dreams?
 I rolled to my side, rubbing the sleep from my face.
 There were a few books on the bedside table and I reached over to draw the top one near.
 I flipped idly through the pages, until I recognized it was detailing the different aspects of magic.
 I hurriedly scanned through, getting caught on a section marked Exchange.

The words stung him.
 His vision swam crimson.
 He felt his hands close upon his swords.
 Perhaps he shouldn’t have saved her.
 Perhaps he should have left her bleeding upon the ground to die alone and…
 “No!” he screamed, flinging himself to his knees.
 He drew his swords and flung them aside, not daring to have their touch near him just then.
 Velixar’s voice throbbed in his ears, a chant of promises and loyalty.
 “Deny the gift,” Aurelia said, the faintest hint of magic on her fingertips.
 “Give me some shred of hope.”

On Point Loma, in Fort Rosecrans, Eric’s dad’s grave lies in a clearing with no shrubs or trees nearby to mark the spot yet, even in the dark, Eric walked right to it.
 He knelt beside it.
 A couple feet down from the headstone, he dug out a piece of sod, dropped a candy heart underneath it, and replaced the sod.
 We left the cemetery and parked just outside, and sat on the ground with our legs hanging over, about fifty feet above where the waves flooded the tide pools.
 Once before in this spot, Eric had mused that whenever he died, he wanted his ashes scattered from here, out toward the beach and sea.
 Several times, he placed a candy heart on his tongue, chewed slowly, and washed it down with the wine we had brought.
 “I’ve got to tell you,” he said.
 “The big change still hasn’t come, but it’s getting awfully close.” “Hey,” I argued, “you already got kicked out of school, you’re working full-time and don’t much hang out with friends anymore.
 Now you’re ready to start adult school, right?

Steed took some food to Anvil, Grey and Ruby made their way to the front window, and I found myself sitting alone with Chevelle.
 “How do you feel?” he asked.
 “Better.
 And worse.” Better because the dust was clearing.
 Worse because I was fuzzy again, bound.
 He nodded.
 He was closer now, sitting opposite me, and I had the disconcerting feeling that I’d lost the bit of time when he’d moved there.
 He reached out and took my hand in his, his fingers gentle as he turned it palm up to place a pebble there.
 “Can you do anything with this?” “No.” Frustration was clear in my voice.

Prospects and Emerging Opportunities
 Viewing the global employment situation as a whole, there are strong grounds for confidence in a brighter future.
 Resurgent Asia: The nations of East Asia, which went through rapid expansion followed by a major financial crisis, are back on the growth path.
 The Japanese economy is once again growing and creating new jobs, both at home and abroad, especially in China, which has become the largest destination for Japanese foreign investment and a key supplier base for Japanese manufactured goods.
 China’s economy continues to expand at more than eight per cent annually and India’s may soon achieve that rate of growth.
 Fuelled by very rapid expansion of automotive, financial services, IT, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications, India has emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in the world, the third largest destination for foreign investment, and a key player in IT and IT-enabled services.
 According to a recent study, by 2040 China and India will be the first and third largest economies in the world.
 Together with Russia and Brazil, they could account for a larger portion of world GDP than today’s six largest industrialized nations.

I wonder what sort of tricks he’ll want me to perform for our guests.
 How will he display my talents this time?
 I understand he needs to show strength in his position, but it seems as if he’s being a bit obvious.

I was a hawk, flying high above the mountain.
 My wings stretched as I soared through an endless and open sky.
 Through keen eyes I watched below, surveying a massive structure of dark stones.
 Then I was a wolf, running through those stones, hunting, searching, protecting.
 My muscular shoulders tensed and released with each long stride.
 I was myself again, though strong and confident.
 Two statuesque elves, twinned in white, glided past me.
 Lightning struck around me, cracking the dark stones of the walls.
 Reed of Keithar Peak stood before me and suddenly I was on a pedestal, looking down as he wagged his tongue at me.
 I scorned him, burning a chunk of it off, and he smiled.

“Did his tongue die with him?” Harruq asked.
 “I haven’t told him he can speak yet,” Qurrah responded.
 His eyes flicked back from Harruq to the spirit.
 “You may talk, spirit, but keep it quiet.”
 “You take my life, and now you dare keep me from eternity?” the spirit moaned.
 “For what reason do you torment me?
 I have never harmed you, never said a cursing word, but now this?”
 “Just a few questions and you may return to your slumber.”
 Qurrah paused, a smile growing across his lips.

“Halt, who goes there?” one of the guards shouted to them as they neared.
 They wore polished chainmail shining red in the firelight.
 The crest of Neldar adorned their tabards.
 Longswords hung from their belts.
 “Me be Harruq Tun!” the half-orc said as he stepped further into the light, grinning stupidly.
 “And this be me brother, Qurrah!”
 “Get back you smelly thing,” the other guard said.
 Both stood to face him as other guards stirred from their blankets and bedrolls.
 They still wore their chainmail, proof something had disturbed them greatly.

She bounced twice and clapped her hands at her success.
 And then she was over it.
 “Let’s eat.

 “Hmm.

 Not supposed to leave you.” I stood, waiting.
 “Food,” she decided.
 She yanked two cloaks from the corner and tied them on, covering our heads, and led me to the wardrobe by her bed.

The top of its handle was loose.
 His sword was possibly worse with chips and a crack starting high up.
 As the two circled each other, Rodregas’ realized that his first impression, that she was of the blood was clearly true.
 She was both quicker and stronger than a normal human.
 She was also highly skilled, and while not as physically gifted as Rodregas, she was powerful.
 She was also clearly intelligent.
 She must have been watching Rodregas in earlier matches, as she refused to let him close with her shield to shield and let him out muscle her.
 She moved quickly and fluidly, keeping her feet moving and keeping her distance.
 Her sword wove in and out, back and forth.
 Rodregas blocked one blow only to find two others coming at him.

Some of your work hints at it—but it’s subtext, it’s buried.
 BG: 	Lately, for whatever reasons, I have been thinking more about the spiritual side of the human animal than ever I have in my previous twenty-some year tenure on Spaceship Earth.
 It probably has to do with getting older, finding my stability in Lor.
 Time at least to take a peak into the spiritual caldron.
 There are miracles, it might cause one to whisper, alone in the dark.
 I’m not comfortable, really, man, talking about my numinous side, as interesting as I think that is.
 I want to ask a lot of questions, without presuming there are always answers.
 Like, where do lares and penates, where does religion, fit in with this cynical lifestyle we’ve adopted, or that we’ve carefully constructed?
 As The Lovin’ Spoonful asked, “Do you believe in magic?” I mean, I don’t know what has caused me to cogitate about the underlying premise of life, you know?.

“I was just, um, I never got a chance to thank you.” Harruq felt his face flush.
 This was the most awful thing he had ever done.
 He’d prefer to face a dragon in unarmed combat.
 He’d have better odds surviving, too, based on Aurelia’s cold, steeled look.
 “You came all the way out here to thank me?
 Hardly sounds like an orcish thing to do.”
 One would not have thought gray skin could turn so red, but it did.

The night came when the father was taken for the ceremony.
 Rodregas was on guard duty when Korin came down in his new body.
 The poor lad had stared at the man who had been his father, saying nothing, but tears ran down his cheeks.
 The apprentice Immortalist had then proceeded to rape the mother.
 The Adapt was rough and the act was violent and Korin, in his new body, clearly enjoyed the violence more than the sex.
 After he had finished with the mother, he had the guards release the boy who had run over to his sobbing bleeding mother.
 In a fatherly gesture Korin had kissed the boy on the cheek and, wrapping his hands around the boy’s head in a slow loving gesture, made a quick yank and broke Join’s neck.
 The next day the guards released the young AElfin widow.
 Rodregas had helped drag her beyond the gates.
 She lay there not moving, limp though alive; she was dead in every way that mattered.

 A swirling black portal ripped into existence behind him, a bleak wind wailing from it.
 Out came his undead, marching in rows of ten.
 More than a hundred rows spilled out, surrounding their master with mindless perfection.
 “Find him,” he ordered as he covered his face with his hood.
 “He is wounded.

Their productivity can be increased by increasing the speed with which they are employed, in the same way that land productivity can be raised by increasing cultivation from one to two cropping seasons per year.
 In the most industrially advanced nations, the velocity of money is roughly 2.5 to 3 times higher than in the average developing country.
 Removing administrative red tape and inefficiencies in the banking system can multiply the use value and productivity of real money, because the same money can be utilized for more transactions.
 The same is true for information, technology, training, transport and other factors.
 Increasing the speed of dissemination of information and new technology can accelerate the creation of new businesses and new jobs.
 In many developing countries, inefficient bureaucracies are slow to take decisions, issue licences, review applications, sanction loans, and amend legislation.
 This inefficiency directly impacts on the pace of development.
 Streamlining and expediting decision making and the movement of other social resources is a highly effective strategy for spurring development.
 Comparative scales need to be created to measure the movement of each of these social forces within and between nations.
 Strategies can be evolved to stimulate more rapid overall development by directly acting to increase the velocity of these forces up to ten-fold or even more.

We roamed alleys and climbed hills no doubt mistaking mathematicians, who commuted daily to San Jose, for poets or novelists.
 Everybody who looked at home, we imagined had flopped in the Beat boarding houses Kerouac immortalized, or at least listened to the man speak his words in the Cellar, accompanied by a jazz riffing tenor sax.
 We overdosed on espresso.
 Then, as we climbed a hill to recover, I recited a jumble of lines I remembered from Ginsberg's Howl: "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix, wandered around and around at midnight in the railway yard wondering where to go, and loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking visionary Indian angels, and lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup, a hopeless task, and so took ship and disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving nothing behind but the shadow of dungarees and the larva and ash of poetry..." And I recited from On the Road about the children crying in Iowa where they let the children cry and where "the evening star must be drooping and spreading her sparkler dims on the prairie, which is just before the coming of complete night that blesses the earth, darkens the all rivers, cups the peaks and folds the final shore in."
 We explored every street and alley of North Beach and drifted into Chinatown, where I imagined us meeting two exquisite immigrant girls.
 I told Eric these beauties would plead for us to steal them away from the rich devil who had enslaved and brought them from China.
 We would conspire to snatch a suitcase full of cash from the rich devil.
 Then we would speed off toward the forests of Idaho to live in dissolute passion for a while.
 As always when my mind spilled over, Eric stood by me, often wearing a smile that hinted of love.
 Back in North Beach after midnight, a couple of Finochio’s transvestite dancers waylaid us.

 Then the blue flaming energy was sucked into the pale green circle.
 There the prisoner, now empty of his own essence, stood still.
 As the blue fire was sucked into his body, the corporal body suddenly seemed more solid than before.
 Once more Ravenhurr yelled out in his melodious voice the trigger words for the next part of the ritual, “Mana faria podia ricoria.” It was now or never for Rodregas to strike.
 Rodregas raised his arm up and threw his club forward with all his strength.
 There was no time to see if his club hit Junnit or if the half AElfin maiden ran.
 Rodregas half ran and half jumped to the next circle, where Ravenhurr stood with raised arms.
 Ravenhurr was focused on his inner magic and was not prepared for his own guards’ sudden action.

Safety Nets: Long-term solution to the problem of food security requires efforts that will make people food self-sufficient.
 But until those efforts can be put in place and made effective, continued reliance will have to be placed on public programmes such as India’s highly successful Mid-Day Meal scheme for school children and Food for Work programs that combine employment and food security.
 The traditional concept of Food for Work needs to be enlarged to include skilled work related to human and social development.
 A Global Food Guarantee scheme should be put in place, which combines Food for Work and Employment Guarantee in a systematic manner.
 Human Development
 Development is a human process.
 It is the result of human aspirations turned into action, human energies expressed in thought and work, human imagination and creativity turned toward the upliftment of life, the invention of processes and products to enhance human productivity, the accumulation of knowledge and wisdom passed on from one generation to another, the acquisition and perfection of skills transmitted from parent to child, the conversion of talents into capacities, the pursuit of ideals, an ever widening of attitudes, and the evolution of more complex and productive forms of organization.
 As this evolutionary process unfolds, each element of human personality -- physical skill, vital relationship, mental understanding, spiritual values – is enhanced in a progression without end, bringing with it greater material fruits, richer life experience, and higher knowledge.
 The unfolding and flowering of the human being is at once the source and the goal of development.

When Kenny asked him to explain, he only insisted he didn’t want Billy or me along.
 He wouldn’t say why.
 That night on Viejas grade, Mike was driving when they swerved off the road and careened down an embankment.
 On account of some miracle or quirk of physics, the little car didn’t roll, only slammed down on a wide ledge in the mountainside.
 Eric was riding shotgun, where I might've been, since I was taller and longer-legged than any of the others except Mike Beatty, who was driving.
 In those days nobody wore seatbelts.
 Though Kenny would later swear he found the shotgun door closed, and the window closed and unbroken, Eric flew out.
 The door must have opened then slammed shut after him.
 His head, which may have contained the purest, most discerning mind of our generation, rammed against a granite boulder.

Our limo pulls up followed by a stream of limos and cars.
 A large tent is up over the gravesite and rows of chairs for the service.
 The massive flower arrangements, which have somehow followed us from every location, are front and center next to a podium where people will once again speak to what a wonderful father, son, brother, (criminal), blah blah blah Dino was.
 Everyone is seated and the service is ready to begin.
 Once the sermon begins, though, guess what is back?
 Yep, we can hear the helicopter, but we can’t see it through trees and tent.
 The noise gets louder and louder and it suddenly drops down behind the podium.
 The wind from the swirling blades intensifies and the flower displays that sit on tripods start to fall forward and the tent begins to rattle and shake, the wind starts to uproot the tent from the stakes which anchor it.
 The helicopter is facing us and begins to slowly maneuver to expose its side.
 The tent is ripped from the ground and tumbles away leaving a clear view of the black helicopter that is lowering itself closer to the ground.

The hot Utah sun was trying to knock me to my knees as I slowly made my way down our lane.
 For a moment I thought about what would happen if I fell and hurt myself.
 By the time Mom realized I was missing, I'd be a perfectly preserved mummy, sucked completely dry by the harsh climate, exactly as ordered for a pyramid burial.
 I hadn't realized some part of me was hoping Mom would be there waiting when I got home.
 I felt it shrink as I came around the corner and saw the empty cement pad.
 I walked through the door and dropped my things on the couch.
 I could feel myself sinking back into oblivion, but instead of welcoming it, I was suddenly terrified.
 I'd spent weeks numb to the entire world.
 I'd even missed Dad's favorite season, the one that'd become mine as well.
 It'd be all too easy to slip into the same kind of numbness now as a refuge against everything.

His heart plummeted.
 "Why didn't you come tell me?"
 She just shrugged again.
 "I-I'll go sit on the patio and wait for you."
 "That's OK.

 He walked silently at her side.
 When they were back inside, she didn't go upstairs to change.
 Instead, she went to the living room and sat in a corner of the sofa, erecting an invisible wall between them.
 Bewildered and a little hurt, he sat down on the opposite end and turned on the TV.

 When he touched her midriff again, he felt her muscles clench in response.
 Her skin was softer than anything he’d ever touched .

 He also knew she was on fire.

I have suffered beyond anything you can do to me.”
 A firestorm of anger overwhelmed the elf’s features.
 He stepped back and drew an arrow.
 Qurrah lashed his whip, but his speed was not enough.
 An arrow tore right through his hand.
 The whip fell, the fire vanishing the second it left contact with Qurrah’s skin.
 A second arrow followed.
 The half-orc rocked backward, his brown eyes wide in shock, as the tip pierced deep into his throat.

 Our mother was intelligent, at least for an orc, but was she smart enough to leave us clues within our own names?”

ICPF strongly favours a movement towards the liberalization of world trade in agricultural products because it can be of immense benefit to job creation, industrialization, and economic growth in developing countries, and thereby act as a driving force for growth and employment generation in the industrial world as well.
 The liberalization of domestic policies for this sector is also needed in developing countries where government controls and populist policies have often retarded growth of agriculture.
 However, the timing and extent of these measures should be dictated by the relative strengths and needs of each particular country, not by strict adherence to any economic doctrine.
 Role of Government
 Agricultural subsidies and protection are subsets of a larger issue – the role of government in agricultural development.
 The experience of the past four decades strongly supports the view that government can play a vital role in stimulating agriculture up to the stage where the rural economy demonstrates the dynamism needed to take off on its own.
 Although the Green Revolution has been widely heralded as an achievement of modern technology, the hybrid seeds and chemical-based cultivation practices that formed the technological basis for the breakthrough in foodgrain production constitute only one part of a comprehensive, integrated development strategy in which government played a central and crucial role.
 This strategy included massive, country-wide demonstration programmes to introduce farmers to new technology, the establishment of new public sector agencies for rapid multiplication and distribution of seeds, assured markets and guaranteed floor prices for foodgrains to eliminate fear that higher production would result in crashing prices, construction of additional storage capacity to house the increased production, import or manufacture of fertilizers, and, most importantly, for transport, distribution and marketing of surplus grains in food deficit areas.
 Few developing countries – perhaps few countries at any stage of development – could have marshalled resources on such a massive scale and instituted such widespread changes so rapidly without heavy reliance on the government for both planning and execution.
 In the majority of developing countries, government is still the most organized and efficient agency and the only one capable of such significant initiative.

“They rise.”
 Sure enough, the arrow-ridden bodies stirred.
 As if of one mind, they rose together, ignoring any injuries upon them.
 Some hobbled on broken legs while others shambled with twisted and mangled arms.
 The brothers watched as hundreds more lumbered through the still-broken southern gate.
 A few belated alarms cried out from the exhausted guards, but they were too few and too late.
 Unencumbered, the horde of dead marched out to where the necromancer extended his arms to embrace them.
 Harruq and Qurrah watched until the sun rose in the east and all trace of the necromancer vanished.
 “What is it he wanted?” Harruq asked, breaking their long silence.
 “More dead for his army,” Qurrah surmised.

“I’ll get you some food,” he said.
 A fire lit beside us as if of its own accord.
 He strode off in search of food, and I sat close, tucking my cheeks into the material of the cloak for warmth.
 A moment later, he was back, our breakfast roasting over the flames.
 We ate in silence and mounted the horses as we had each day before, but it was obvious nothing was the same.
 How could it ever be?
 I was racked with guilt as we made our way up the mountain.
 I purposefully rode behind him, glad at least to be able to control the horse on my own.
 Small patches of snow had started to dot the landscape, the vegetation a darker, sharper green.
 Occasionally the sun would break through the mist, making me squint, and I would appreciate the calmer, hazier atmosphere.

 Aurelia gasped as all her power flowed into her shield.
 The collision sent her flying, her magical barrier shattered into nothingness.

 Every nerve in her body shrieked with pain.

I have told my friends to imagine driving down a beautiful highway on the way to a vacation spot in the mountains, with all of your plans for the trip clearly in your mind.
 Now imagine that your car’s emergency brake is unexpectedly pulled— hard— your calm drive is suddenly spinning out of control.
 You don’t know which way to turn the wheel or what pedal to push.
 You just act and react and pray for the best all within a moment.
 And the car never regains control.
 That’s parenting.

Sure enough, it was a dwarf but there was something strangely different about this particular dwarf.
 He just walked toward us as if he wasn't afraid that I might put an arrow through his head.
 Just as I was about to release my arrow, the dwarf cried, “Please stop!” I don’t know why I listened to him but I didn’t pull the string.
 The dwarf was acting different than the others; its pudgy eyes were filled with fear at the sight of my arrow.
 “Why?” Seth growled.
 “Your kind has done nothing good to us except make us confused and our lives more complicated.” The dwarf looked startled.
 “Oh you’ll have to excuse my brethren; they have a tendency to be rather annoying.” He took a long frightened look at Seth’s sword.
 “Good sir, before you try to slay me, I have a message to deliver from her majesty.” I lowered my bow because I had a feeling I wanted to know what this message was.
 If it was a lie, Seth and I could kill him anyway in a blink of an eye.

 “You okay, Jazell?” he asked me and held out a hand.
 I took his hand and he pulled me up.

The democratic revolution that has so effectively penetrated Eastern Europe in recent years and extended its roots in other regions must be taken to its logical conclusion at the level of nations and at the level of international institutions.
 World Peace Army: The most far-sighted of ICPF’s proposals sought to evolve a practical mechanism to promote the objectives of cooperative security and democratic freedom.
 It called for the establishment of a World Peace Army, to be constituted by and open to all democratic countries willing to renounce the right to aggression against other nations and willing to contribute personnel and resources to an international multilateral military force capable of defending its members from external threats.
 Such a mechanism, so long as it is inclusive, would provide a real and viable alternative to national militarization, whether or not it was constituted by or within the UN system.
 The success of NATO in maintaining peaceful relations among the democratic states of Western Europe and North America for more than half a century is a viable model which is limited primarily by the exclusivity of its membership.
 The recent measures taken by the European Union to constitute a European Army are evidence of the practicality of establishing a similar mechanism open to all nations.
 The unfortunate situation now witnessed in Iraq could have been avoided, if ICPF’s plea for a World Peace Army had been heeded.
 Eradicating the Roots of Terrorism: Terrorism is not new to the world, but with the withdrawal of national rivalries between East and West, violence by non-nation states has increased in intensity and is viewed as a far greater security concern by the entire world.
 This has spurred an unprecedented international effort to control and suppress terrorist activity.
 But there is little hope of abolishing this menace without simultaneously comprehending and addressing the root causes of terrorism in the world today.

A granite stone about three feet across came bounding and crashing toward us, gathering speed as it careened.
 We scrambled off the boulder and into the shelter of a grotto beside the trickling stream.
 Once we caught our breath, we crawled and peeked out from behind the rocks that formed the grotto’s walls.
 On the hillside, Tom stood waving our crowbar, bellowing laughter and prying loose another big stone.
 We tugged on our jeans and shoes while he rolled more stores and slung smaller rocks at us.
 The way his legs slashed and arms whirled, he looked like some rabid demon.
 Four of us split off, two up the canyon, two down.
 When we got beyond his range, we climbed, intending to circle above him.
 Such a fury possessed us, we might have stoned him to death.

 Rodregas tried to reach out to push Ravenhurr into the circle, but before his hand touched the sorcerer, Ravenhurr lost his balance and fell into the circle.
 The moment that Ravenhurr crossed into the circle he started to burn.
 His body twisted in pain as he burned the same blue fire of creation that he had called forth to rip apart a man’s soul and steal the physical essence of a Celestial Lion.
 The flames that he had called forth to steal the AElfin maiden’s magical abilities now burned him.
 The timing had been near impossible.
 The spell calling forth the flames of creation could only burn one life.
 But the timing was perfect; Ravenhurr called forth the fire, and then he was in it.

Faster than I would've believed possible, we were all in our dresses, and waiting in the living room for the boys to make their appearance.
 Jasmin and Rachel had worked what I was pretty sure was actual magic.
 Even Jessica was nothing less than stunning, and I didn't look as bad as normal.
 Jasmin's backless black dress and shoulder-length gloves had streaks of blue that brought out her eyes, while Dominic's tight, red gown seemed to give her the confidence and poise you'd expect from someone so gorgeous and utterly exotic.
 Jess had opted for a sleeveless silver number that flared out at the bottom so much I wasn't sure how Isaac would be able to walk next to her without stepping on the shimmery material.
 Rachel's mauve dress was probably the most conservative of all, neither over-snug, nor especially low-cut.
 It had seemed entirely out of character considering what she'd purchased for the rest of us, but when I'd asked, she'd just grimaced and said Alec would've made her stay home if she'd chosen anything more daring.
 None of which helped me feel any more comfortable in the tight, strapless wonder Rachel had been so excited to give me.
 Even with all of the weight I'd lost since the accident, it still felt like the material was fighting a losing battle to stretch itself over my frame.
 I'd been hoping to be able to put off actually putting the dress on for at least another half hour, but when my makeup had finally been pronounced satisfactory, Jasmin had studied me for a few minutes, pulled my hair back, secured it with a pair of silver combs I was worried might actually contain genuine diamonds, and then helped Rachel cram me into the dress.

She took the handkerchief he'd just pulled from his pocket, wiping her face.
 "It's so horrible.
 If-if I were to keep this beautiful ring, the first thing I'd want to do would be to run to my mother and tell her all about it.
 But I can't go to her.
 And when I can finally run to her, I won't be wearing this ring."
 Slowly she removed the ring from her finger.
 "I love you, Rick.

 Rick drew her into his arms, feeling torn apart himself.

Grey bowed out of the circle and was replaced by the two tall, silvery elves.
 I found myself startled again; I had not seen them sitting with the group, or anywhere else.
 For some reason, it was much more eerie than the little wiry man who blinked in and out of vision.
 One of the men spoke, his tone formal.
 “We will not demonstrate their full power at this time, in fear of shorting our forces a man for mere display.” I assumed he was probably joking.
 “As you can see, they can be frightening, however, without attack.” At that, the dogs walked into the circle.
 I had not seen them either, before they were approaching their masters.
 They came forward to snarl, one regarding Ruby and one Steed, and I could only be glad it wasn’t me as their muzzles pulled back and exposed a vicious set of teeth, complete with meat-tearing fangs.
 The hair rose on their backs and I was suddenly positive they were larger than Ruby.
 A horrific growl ripped from their chests in unison and I cringed.

Since I knew he had a device called a Wizinator that is sold at smoke shops to look like you are pissing—it has a bag filled with either synthetic urine or someone else’s—I made him show me he was really pissing.
 After he complied, he crawled back into bed.
 Positive for Oxy.
 Top of the scale positive.
 I looked over at Brandon to see him peering at me from the bed, knowing that drug tests don’t lie but drug addicts do.
 I screamed at him to pack his shit and get the fuck out.
 I had been left with only one option—to toss Brandon out on the street to hit bottom— because what I was doing wasn’t enough.
 Or maybe what I was doing was too much?
 I had just risked my life to help him and apparently while I was getting wired to save his ass, he had managed to get Oxy into my home and got high while I was working his undercover drug deal.
 Not only was I devastated, I was a sucker and a fool to have helped him.

“Trying,” Harruq whispered back.
 They marched at sword point.
 Onlookers cackled as they passed, figuring the two were thieves or vagrants caught brawling.
 Their orcish features lent them no kindness, and a few children even threw rocks until the guards shooed them away.
 The whole while Harruq burned with shame and rage.
 They reached the western gate, which remained open during the day.
 Without ceremony, they were kicked through, both falling to the dirt and scraping their knees.
 “Get going,” one said.
 “See if somewhere else will take your mutt ass.”
 It was not just adrenaline that caused Harruq’s hands to shake, but Qurrah put his hand on his wrist and begged him to calm.

However, these changes do not go far enough in furthering the interests of global peace and development.
 They will not fundamentally alter the out-dated, non-representative structure which perpetuates the status quo.
 It is time to devise a new formula and a new structure for international governance that will reconcile and harmonize the political rights and economic interests of all the world’s peoples.
 The institution that had come to symbolize the Cold War must be restructured in such a manner as to symbolize the abolition of all war and the establishment of peace and democracy as the foundations for global development.
 Global Social Revolution
 A second revolution also possesses tremendous transforming power to accelerate human progress – the revolution of rising expectations.
 This revolution is not new in conception or expression, but what is new is its rapid extension to encompass people and nations around the globe.
 Although the term was first applied to describe the growing aspirations of the middle class in North America forty years ago, it is now widely applicable to all social and economic groups in both developed and developing countries.
 After countless centuries of slow, often imperceptible progress, humanity everywhere is on the move.
 A rising tide of technological advancement has brought with it wave after wave of social innovation.

He slowly reached up, and using the full strength of his body, pushed hard on her muscular chest, pushing her away from the bear’s haunch.
 He then ignored her and went back to cutting the haunch loose.
 He waited but the two lionesses seemed to have gone from aggression to napping, with him missing the transition.
 Slowly, Rodregas got up with his bear haunch and took it back to the barn.
 He met the surprised look of Doi’van and Imeralda with a half smile, “I hope you like the taste of bear?” As he was unsure of how old the meat was, he immediately started a fire and started to cook it.
 As he worked on preparing the fire he explained what had happened.
 “Are you suicidal?” asked Imeralda in an angry voice.
 “I know you felt they were not a danger, but to walk up and take the food from two Dire Cats?
 That is just asking to be killed.” Her voice was unusually high pitched and she was shaking her head in disbelief.
 “The Dire Bear must have been living in the cellar,” said Doi’van.

The four of us pressed together.
 “This is the prey?” a rake-like voice cackled.
 “This is nothing!” I saw Seth draw his sword and the rest of us readied our weapons.
 I gripped my bow so hard that I was afraid it might break in two.
 I heard more screechy laughter.
 “Easy kill,” another agreed.
 “No challenge,” something else piped up.
 “The King under estimates our abilities.” It laughed.

He spotted the robes of Velixar and ran to them.
 He picked them up and shook them, furious that no body remained.
 “You lied to me, Velixar,” Qurrah said.
 “You said you were eternal.
 You said you held the power of a god.
 But you lied.
 You are nothing but dust.”
 Surrounded by fire and death, the half-orc stripped naked of his rags and donned the robes of his former master.

Bows cracked and broke in the hands of their masters.
 The few stray animals hit by the wave vomited their intestines and died.
 The elves that endured it found their minds a chaos of horrors, inescapable terror clutching their hearts.

 The men charged, driven by madness they had never felt before.

Buddy was loved, revered.
 He was not held to the same rules as everyone else.
 So it goes with the great.
 And when Buddy started using drugs, mixing bennies, reds and laxatives in dangerous quantities, no one was there to question him.
 Of course, drugs were part of the scene then.
 They were everywhere.
 In the back of every minibus, in the bathroom of every nightclub, at practice sessions, in the homes of every groupie.
 And Buddy had his groupies.
 The twins used to joke that Buddy played for scrimption and blow jobs.

 But that is not the problem.
 Either way you should be physically more powerful.

 Rodregas knew him well enough to wait until he was ready.
 Rodregas had been surprised when Doi’van had refused to take back his oath when they had had some privacy.
 Doi’van had simply said he took his oaths too seriously to play such games.
 So Rodregas had sworn the same oath to Doi’van, which Doi’van had accepted.
 Doi’van though was more focused on the task than the oath.

Advances in multimedia technology now makes it possible to utilize computers, internet and even television broadcasts to deliver a wide range of educational information and vocational skills that otherwise would be unavailable or very costly to disseminate.
 Upgrading the quality of education and enhancing the skills of the work force will accelerate job creation the world over.
 Distance education provides new opportunities for achieving the goal of education for all within a span of a few years.
 The Challenge and the Opportunity
 The problem of unemployment is of relatively recent origin.
 The very idea of employment as opposed to livelihood is a recent conception born of the Industrial Revolution.
 In principle, every human being born creates at least the potential for his own employment, because his very birth generates demand for additional products and services and because each individual possesses the innate capacity to acquire productive skills and creative knowledge capable of generating new products and services to meet new and existing social needs.
 That is why, in spite of rapid strides in the mechanization of agriculture and mass production in manufacturing, the six-fold multiplication of human population since 1800 has been accompanied by a more or less equivalent growth of employment opportunities.
 The present job gap is small compared with the enormous expansion of the labour force.
 As people develop, their aspirations rise and higher level needs emerge – needs for education, health care, balanced diet, entertainment, travel and communication – multiplying demand for new workers to provide them.

In parallel to a UN Earth corps, national Earth corps units should be constituted to operate within each state and for service internationally under the UN.
 Vocational skills imparted through these agencies will be of subsequent use to the community at large.
 5.A greater degree of cooperation in the sharing of environmental data is essential if global security is to be enhanced, particularly that gained from military remote-sensing devices.
 This is especially relevant to the majority of nations which do not have such equipment at their disposal.
 The need for secrecy, always stressed in the Cold War period, has been superseded by the need for openness.
 6.An international system should be instituted by the UN to assist in the transfer of environmentally beneficial technology, as recommended by the Royal Society and the United States National Academy of Sciences, both from the developed to the less-developed nations, and from the military to the non-military sectors.
 This applies in particular to the field of information technology, where there is scope for dual use of existing military capabilities.
 Closer links should be established between research and development teams in the military and civilian sectors at the national level.
 7.A greater degree of regional cooperation is desirable between states which share natural resources and common environmental interests.
 This is of particular importance where regional peace and stability is at stake, as in the Middle East, over the question of access to water supplies.

I think of my sons, Brandon completely fucked up from his drug addiction and Bryce away at college completely unaware of what is happening and what risk his dad is about to take.
 It occurs to me that Bryce and my wife may never forgive Brandon if something were to happen to me.
 I recall their little league baseball games and soccer teams I coached.
 All of the art projects which we proudly displayed with the help of refrigerator magnets over the years.
 Particular events in their life pop in and out of my head.
 Their future begins to enter my mind and I hope and pray that I will see Brandon free from his addiction one day and see Bryce graduate college.
 Who will they marry one day, how many children will they have, will I be a grandpa or a memory?
 Too many thoughts are packed in my head as I realize this is my life and my family’s life passing before me as the moment of truth approaches.

I was wearing light brown hunting boots and tight black pants made out of some sort of light cloth.
 A thick woven jacket was shielding me from the October cold.
 When I looked back at Seth, I realized he had also made an outfit change.
 He was wearing black leather boots and dark blue pants.
 His top was a short, brown cloak with a hood and leather belt.
 A beautiful steel sword with an ornamental hilt was swinging at his side from a woven sheath.
 “Oh well, I guess I have green hair.
 It’s not that bad.
 I like green.” I rambled as I examined the short hunting knife that was resting in a small sheath on my hip.
 I ran a finger over the blade before putting it back.

Lagrimas del Angel.
 The whole greenhouse was filled with them, and suddenly I couldn't ignore the significance of the circular signature on the paintings anymore.
 I hurried outside, looked desperately from side to side for some hint of which way he'd gone, and then headed off to the right towards the sound of shattering pottery.
 Just before I was about to give up hope of finding him, I heard another crash and turned into a small grotto.
 The sight of rock walls nearly covered by a swath of greenery caused me to pull up with a suddenness that only barely saved me from tumbling into the small reflecting pool off to one side.
 Alec froze at my appearance, a large planter that easily weighed as much as I did dangling from one hand.
 The shards of pottery strewn about the grotto answered any questions I might have had regarding its imminent fate.
 Neither of us moved for several seconds, and then he turned towards me with a glare.
 "Go away!"
 The command was so forceful it was almost more than I could do to stop myself from turning and running away in terror, but I held my ground.

A comprehensive, total approach, rather than partial and half-way measures, is needed.
 No industrial country can claim that it systematically exploits all the potential benefits of the strategies in this list.
 This should be the highest priority of every Western government today.
 1.Promote small businesses: All the publicity given to the impact of down-sizing by major corporations has obscured the fact that the top 500 US firms employ less than five per cent of the US workforce.
 It is also the smaller firms that are responsible for job growth.
 Businesses employing fewer than 20 workers presently account for 57 per cent of new job creation in Europe.
 Based upon the successful examples of many developing countries that have stimulated growth in this sector, there is vast scope for expanding services to support new enterprises through better access to management and employee training courses, credit and R & D facilities; by testing and certification for those who want to start businesses; and by estab lishing business incubators to provide work space and shared services as well as technical, financial and marketing expertise to start-up companies.
 2.Reduce business failures: New businesses create most of the jobs, but they destroy most of them too, by going out of business.
 The failure rate of new businesses is extremely high in most industrial nations.
 In Italy, roughly 50 per cent fail in the first year.

 "No, it isn't because he doesn't trust you.
 If he didn't trust you, he wouldn't have brought you here.
 He'd trust Isaac or Jasmin with his or even Rachel's life, but neither of them know about me.

Following in his footsteps will lead to a similar fate.”
 The half-orc said nothing.
 For a moment all three glanced about, the atmosphere akin to air before a thunderstorm.
 Qurrah broke the silence.
 “Woodhaven is behind us,” he said.
 “I have made mistakes, as has my brother.
 I saw you leave with him, and I know you sacrificed much to protect him.
 For this, I thank you.
 All I ask is that we speak naught of this again.
 If we are to travel together, it is my only wish.”

We are told to do whatever he commands, but also told to stay as far away from him as possible,” said the young boy, who could not have been much more than twelve years old.
 Rodregas nodded and said, “Sounds like good advice.” Rodregas looked up as Doi’van and Imeralda entered the room.
 Doi’van looked grim.
 But as Rodregas assumed no one had died, he had to smile.
 “Is it that bad?” he asked.
 Doi’van missed his amused tone, or he was simply not in the mood to hear it.
 “The news is not all good,” Doi’van agreed.
 Doi’van grabbed the far too small stool beside the bed, which was the only other piece of furniture in the little dorm room that they had been assigned.
 Rodregas knew it was only due to his visitor status and having ‘servants’ that he had his own room, most squires would share housing during the tournament.
 Rodregas watched the stool curiously as Doi’van sat to see if it would actually hold the massive weight of the Hellborn.

It spun toward me and turned down, tickling my arm and then my nose.
 I giggled despite my wariness, and reached up to rub my nose where the plume had brushed it.
 I noticed the map on my palms.
 “What about spells?” He eyed my hands.
 “Been working spells?” “Not on purpose.” He smiled.
 “Yes, spells can be dangerous.” “Yes,” I agreed, “but why do you need words for spells and not magic?” “A spell can be left, set with a trigger, or larger than your magic.
 They are complicated and wicked things.
 And the ancient language is… tricky.
 Definitely something you should stay away from.
 Years of learning and practice and you can still wreck a spell pretty good.” I thought about that for a moment.

Alec's smile was more bittersweet than normal.
 "No, but it's not too late to save you.
 I can have you on a flight to Paris tonight.
 It's the only way to guarantee your safety."
 I shook my head.
 "I'm not leaving.
 I believe you when you say my going back to Brandon won't solve anything, but I'm not going to run away and leave you all to deal with the mess I created.
 I wish you'd stop asking me to."
 His gaze was long and steady, but finally he nodded.
 "You have as much right to see this through as anyone else does, but it's almost certainly going to get a lot uglier before it's over.

“Please Jazell, let me tell them myself,” he begged.
 I waited for him to let go, but his grip stayed firm and strong.
 I stared at him.
 “Fine but I'm tired of waiting, Seth.” “I know, I promise I'll tell them,” He stood up, his grip still tight.
 “I just don't think now is the right time.
 After something like falling out of the sky, I don't want to bring more bad news.” I sighed.
 “Alright, I'll leave this to you.
 But I swear...” “I will, I promise you!” he interrupted me.
 “I believe you, Seth,” I whispered.
 “Now are you good and clear?” Seth stared at me, looked down at my arm and let go.

She looked up at him.
 "Are you going to tell her about me?"

 "Are you going to tell her I'm from 1927?"
 "Are you kidding?

 I'll just tell her that you're my girlfriend."
 She smiled, but all at once her smile dissolved into an uncomfortable blush.

“No, it’s not even a part of Earth.
 Try creepy, but cool.” Emily rolled her eyes.
 “Boys, I still don’t know how they find this interesting.” She pointed to Jason and Seth, who were continuing to guess random names to describe the arch.
 “I mean, who cares!
 Am I right about them?” “Yes, completely,” I said and fought a laugh.
 “Don’t try to understand or you’ll get lost in the complicated labyrinths that are their brains.” “I think this is the most thinking the two have ever done,” Emily said with a sigh and shook her head, making her pink curls dance.
 “It’s just sad.” I was about to say something else when the dwarf gave a loud cough.
 Jason and Seth fell silent, outlined by the eerie glow of the arch.
 “You must know a few things before you enter,” the dwarf said, pacing back and forth.
 He reminded me of a teacher instructing a class.

Only he'd said in his note not to say anything to anyone.
 Of course.
 He was testing me, making sure I was going to keep quiet about what he'd done.
 Probably because he didn't want any of the praise for such a selfless act.
 I was usually a pretty lousy liar, but it isn't really a lie if you both know the truth.
 "Brandon, you can trust me.

 At least nothing odder than normal for Sanctuary."

Well short for Arthur.

 Something to explain why you, a man self-professed to not being interested in art, is so knowledgeable about Miss Struan.

He continued to stare at the woods as if he expected a flying deer to leap out, wearing pink socks.
 “What the heck Seth, are you deaf now?” I waited for a sign that he heard me to appear on his face, but it remained blank.
 Emily huffed loudly, “Expect something from Jazell and me soon Jason.
 We’re out of here.
 See you around.” She grabbed my hand and pulled me away.
 Seth turned to see me leave and the look gave me a dark feeling inside.
 His face was masked with one emotion, one that made me vow to myself that I would find out what he was hiding, what he was keeping a secret.
 That emotion was not Seth, not the one I knew.
 It made me feel the same way and I didn’t know why.

Biology went better than it had since my first day in Sanctuary, largely because Alec seemed to have developed a postdoctorate knowledge of Biology.
 Also he didn't have a single qualm when it came to using that knowledge to deflect questions aimed at me.
 Mrs. Sorenson tried three different times to make me look stupid before finally giving up and getting down to the business of teaching.
 She continued to shoot us nasty looks throughout the class, but I hardly noticed.
 Alec spent the rest of the class time writing questions for me in the margins of my notebook.
 By the time I'd described my grandparents, kindergarten teacher, and top three most embarrassing moments, I wanted to get a chance to ask some questions of my own, but he just shook his head and passed me my notebook back with a new set of quickly-jotted queries.
 The sentences should have been a careless mess based on the speed with which he was writing.
 Instead they turned out more even and carefully constructed than anything I'd ever been able to accomplish.
 I'm the Alpha here; you can ask your questions when I finish with mine.
 The flippant, humorous nature of his response was so atypical, and yet still quintessentially Alec.

He smiled back and continued.
 “The faery could have easily stabbed me through the heart but he didn't because he wanted me alive; to give to Kojas.” Emily gasped and covered her face.
 “Why, what would he want with you?” Seth closed his eyes.
 “He's saying that I'm going to be his key to success, in taking over Igneeria and Earth.
 He wants to use me, I don't know how yet.
 They're going to do whatever they can to bring me to him; I'm going to have to be extra careful.
 I don't know-” “Seth,” Jason interrupted him.
 Seth looked up at his best friend.
 “Seth,” Jason repeated, “you aren't alone.
 Kojas isn't going to get a chance to use you because he's going to have to get through me first.” “And me,” Emily added.

The Nymphs were not that interested in keeping him because for a Dire steed he is slow.” Doi’van said, “A steed that can handle me?
 That would make a nice change of pace.” Imeralda continued, “He along with the two best of the slavers’ horses that I claimed.
 That means we now have three decent riding horses.
 Not the Dire war mounts that I know you want, but an upgrade on what we had.
 The local armorer was also able to piece together some steel chain that was decent quality and a good leather harness for Doi’van and he was able to repair your armor.
 You now also have some chain that should fit over your leather armor.” Imeralda added, “I was able to recover only about a score of the arrows, but I have been working with some of the wood nymphs and the armorer and we now have a full set of arrows again.” Doi’van, at her motion towards his armor, picked up the pile of chain mail and tried it over his head.
 The opening on top actually fit over his huge head.
 Doi’van guessed that it had been the chain of the large overweight slaver that he had killed.
 While the equipment was all of average quality, Rodregas was smiling because clearly there were three sets of everything plus a pack horse for equipment.
 Imeralda was clearly planning on joining them.

Jim – Can your mom even drink that much, without passing out soon after anyway?

 Liz – If I told you that, then what edge would I have if we ever had a drinking contest?

That would be stupid.

 And about Godzilla being feared, well I was talking to Rusty down the street.

 The one who got thrown into the school dumpster every day at lunchtime by the girls chess team?
 Eugene – That’s the Rusty and it’s called Anime.
 Well Rusty was telling me about how it’s illegal to yell ‘Godzilla’ in a Japanese theatre, like how it’s illegal to yell Fire in an American theatre.
 He says that it’s because the Japanese are that afraid of Godzilla.
 And who can blame them after he ruined Tokyo so many times.
 But anyways Rusty said that most older Japanese people will just soil their shorts even at the mention of their old nemesis.

Somehow, it seemed to have become unhinged.
 Besides, it wasn’t as if he could think of anything to say.
 All his mind could concentrate on was the feel of the elf’s soft lips on his cheek, the flowery scent of her perfume mixed with sweat, and the quick brush of her breasts against his arm.
 By the time his jaw and mind began working again, Aurelia was laughing.
 “What’s so funny?” he demanded.
 The elf smiled.
 “Nothing.

And then my hands found their way to my stomach and rested there.
 I drew in a sharp intake of breath.
 I hadn’t noticed I had gotten so deeply involved in the story.

 But I couldn’t seem to step away.
 I was unnaturally calm when they finally came for me.

"Rachel said you needed some shoes."
 While I was still struggling to get thoughts to coalesce into words, Alec smoothly went down onto one knee, and picked up my left foot.
 The work of art he slipped onto my foot was so beautiful I felt bad letting it touch the ground.
 I held it up for a second, admiring the way the lights played off its gentle curves while I convinced myself nobody was going to throw me into jail for defiling it by using it for its intended function.
 Glass, or possibly something else perfectly transparent.
 It was hard to tell for sure what it was from so far away, but it wasn't plastic.
 The cool ovals where the sole had been cut away to reveal the material underneath told me that much.
 Whatever it was, it'd been created in layers.
 The outermost material was achingly clear, while the inner layers seemed increasingly less so.
 Alec waited, another smile playing about his lips, while I came to terms with the shoes.

See if  you can find out who people want to win and why?” Imeralda was clearly confused by the odd request, but nodded, and after a little talk she slipped away to the food line and within moments was in an animated discussion with a few squires at another table.
 Rodregas thought Doi’van might ask, but he showed no interest and instead said, “While most of the knights are too high and mighty to talk to a Hellborn, the staff is not so closed mouthed.
 The greater sigils are said to be guarded twenty four hours a day in a great chamber in the very heart of the Cathedral.” “And did you ask if sworn men were allowed in with a new knight?” asked Rodregas with a smile.
 “Actually the topic did come up,” said Doi’van with a chuckle like rocks in a land slide.
 “While guards are usually not allowed in, it is not unusual for close friends or advisors to go in with some of those of the blood; to share their wisdom on the best possible greater sigils to take on.” “I will assume,” said Rodregas, “that they had never heard of a Nymph entering the chamber, much less one of the Hellborn?” “AElves are not uncommon and actually more Orqui than I expected.
 One servant thought that Nymphs used to go in during his father’s, father’s time, but not any time recently.
 No one could even imagine a Hellborn going into the Chamber,” agreed Doi’van.
 “Well as far behind as we are, we might not even get the chance to try to bully our way in,” Rodregas said.
 Doi’van nodded and that comment seemed to end the conversation.
 As Rodregas headed out to the sands of the Cathedral arena for the jousting match, he was relieved to see Imeralda waiting at the entrance to talk to him.

Every worker we met was a recovering drug addict and a one-time student of Narconon.
 People from all walks of life, from all over the country and all ages; it was a mosaic of America’s addicts trying to change their lives.
 The longer the students were there, the more naturally they mentored the new arrivals.
 After about a half hour visiting the center, the facility had transformed for us— from a roadside dive motel to an oasis of healing.
 We took Brandon out to Thomas’s for Easter brunch, about an hour away.
 In that hour, a young man, our son, was in our vehicle and he spoke with confidence and newfound wisdom about what he was learning and how he was being taught to apply it to real life situations.
 At the brunch, the family watched as this same young man who was the subject of an intervention just a few months earlier, spoke calmly, listened to others and acted like a normal human being.
 We could not ignore this massive transformation in just two months as an inpatient.
 Lisa and I were thrilled.

“This isn’t fair,” I complained.
 It seemed he was holding me in place just to strike me.
 “It’s the only way, Freya.
 This is for your protection.” “I highly doubt they will pummel my face with rocks,” I spat out.
 “No,” he said, “they will bind you and burn you alive.” I felt sick.
 A vision of the Grand Council cloaks circling me was convincing enough, but he continued.
 “You will not know their thoughts; you must be ready for any attack.” I nodded, even though part of me was certain there was a less painful way.
 The rock came at me again.
 I couldn’t respond quick enough, couldn’t counter and hold on to a galloping horse in the instant it took him to decide.
 It wasn’t dangerous, but it was like being slapped, and the irritation had me itching to burn something.

 Then they clicked and she shoved it in her pocket.
 “Yup I can.” “You’re always one step ahead.” “Always.” “So what do you think we should do?” Emily asked from my bed later on.
 I swallowed the bit of strawberry that had been in my mouth.
 “I don’t know, ambush them back?” “They might see that coming,” she pointed out, “and it’s really obvious.” “Well, they think we won’t do that because that is exactly what they would be expecting, so by actually doing it, we can trick them,” I rambled on and grabbed another strawberry.
 Emily tapped her lip with her pencil and straightened her pink pajamas.
 “I have no clue what you just said Jazell.” I laughed, “What I meant was that we should ambush them.

“I didn’t want you to fight either,” Harruq said, his eyes leaving hers for an instant.

 “Will you kill me, too?”
 “I asked you not to fight, but here you are.

 Looking at Rick, she asked, “Do you still have the article?” “Yeah.

 Without a word, he handed it to her.
 The picture was one she and her parents and John had posed for just days before her father had disinherited him.
 The article with it was short.
 It was strange to read about herself, although, as Rick had told her, it didn’t say much.

I’d had no idea I could produce such a vicious plume of flames.
 I looked to Chevelle.
 “Yes,” he exalted.
 He raised his arms above his head to construct a massive circle of blazing heat.
 When his eyes returned to mine, he smiled.
 He liked playing with fire.
 And then he shoved the fireball toward me with frightening speed.

It wasn't until I finally got to tutoring that I started to put more stock in the idea that Rachel had simply chosen not to go to Les Misérables.
 She looked up, and then away guiltily as I walked in.
 There wasn't a trace of smile or greeting on her face, an abnormality that hit me hard somewhere in the region of my stomach.
 Albert stopped by to say hi, and I used his presence as a distraction.
 "It sounds like you're almost caught up."
 "Yeah, finally.
 I've got another two weeks or so, but then I'll be all done with this whole triple math homework garbage."
 Albert smiled, and for the first time I noticed how genuine his expressions were.
 It was almost like he was a different person when he wasn't concentrating on explaining some particularly stubborn math problem to one of the slower students.
 You know, the ones who still didn't understand why anyone needed to know their multiplication tables.

Eventually, we may hope to dispel the widespread fear and sense of helplessness that this issue evokes.
 The notion that there are a fixed or inherently limited number of jobs that can be created by the economy is a fiction.
 It is not just advances in technology that work in this fashion.
 Every major advance in social attitudes, institutions, values and lifestyles has a dual effect on employment, creating jobs in some areas and destroying them in others.
 Higher standards of education not only raise productivity, but also stimulate higher expectations that lead to greater consumption.
 Changing attitudes toward the environment have created entirely new industries and generated new jobs in every field where impact on the environment is of concern.
 New types of organization such as fast-food restaurants, franchising and hire purchase or leasing create new jobs by hastening the growth or expanding the activities of the society.
 Shifting attitudes toward marriage and the role of women create greater demand for jobs but also more opportunities for employment, because working women consume more and require additional services.
 Anxiety regarding the impact of technological development on jobs has been aggravated by the belief – largely a hangover from the Industrial Age – that in the industrial nations automation is rapidly replacing high-wage manufacturing jobs with low-wage jobs in the service sector.
 Actually, services have had a dominant place in Western economies for most of the twentieth century.

I locked the door for the first time since we'd arrived in Sanctuary, turned on all the downstairs lights, and then slowly walked upstairs.
 It was crazy to be scared that Alec had somehow missed someone, but I couldn't shake the feeling I was being watched.
 Once I finally made it upstairs, I checked both rooms, and the bathroom, before finally relaxing a little.
 I showered quickly, carefully making sure the smell of alcohol and cigarette smoke was out of my hair, and then changed into clean clothes and collapsed onto my bed.
 I was exhausted, but I couldn't fall asleep.
 Every time I closed my eyes, I saw dark shapes hurtling towards me.
 After looking at the clock for the thousandth time, I finally got up and went downstairs.
 The lights were still blazing, just as I'd left them.
 I debated for several seconds before opening the door and stepping out into the darkness.
 Somehow the porch light didn't reach out as far into the yard as I'd remembered.

AElf maidens, when they mate with an AElf man, form a spiritual and magical bond.
 It is a bond that lasts all their lives and connects them on multiple levels as no other race is connected.
 That is why the AElves take so long to choose a life mate and almost never choose one outside of their race.
 They mate for life; not out of choice, but because that is required of their nature.” After Jordaan finished speaking he stood silently as Rodregas sat up in bed and thought on the healer’s words.
 “She is not as free with her body as most Nymphs,” he said.
 “No, she is not.
 She only lies with men who she truly feels a great respect for,” Jordaan answered.
 Rodregas had known that fact, but had not really thought about it.
 “So what you are saying is that Imeralda forms a life bond like a AElf.
 But while a normal AElf has only one she can form multiple bonds, and she has a bond with you and a bond with me?” he asked.

“And that’s another thing—why 84 years in the future?
 Why not five years?
 Or 100 years—at least that’s a round number.
 Why the year 2011?” Her questions made him reflect uncomfortably.
 The fact that he’d read an article about her just days before she’d appeared couldn’t be a coincidence.
 He couldn’t begin to explain the how or the why, but the when made sense.
 He knew what her future was going to be, so maybe he could help change it.
 But he didn’t know if it was a good idea to tell her that right now.
 As soon as she went to bed, he’d get the article out and reread it.

I can work for a few days a week and by not letting myself want a bunch of stuff, I can have money to give away.
 So I’m careful about what I buy, and I pick the things I do buy for durability and longevity.
 I need a car, so I buy a Toyota.
 If I needed a car that would break down, I could buy a Jaguar.
 “And it isn’t only the desire for stuff that devours our time.
 It’s also that we try to buy security.
 People think they need to not only have lots of stuff, but to save or invest or buy some insurance so they’ll be sure they’ll always have lots of stuff.
 We need a bit more faith.
 I mean, I don’t have AAA or any kind of roadside service insurance because every time a car of mine has broken down, it’s been a block or so from my mechanic’s house.
 Except one time.

There was candlelight dancing on the walls, and outside one of those Memphis thunderstorms that seem like the end of the world, beautiful like the end of the world should be, and Lorelei was lying there naked, a vision out of Titian, and I just started singing those lyrics.
 Those were given to me, you know?
 Like they always existed but I was the one that plucked them from the ether.
 It’s weird, that’s the most Memphis song on the LP, though it really is about, what’s inside us, you know?
 What keeps us going, keeps us growing.
 And, it’s not true unless it makes you laugh.
 That’s what I want to say to my critics, you know, lighten up, irony isn’t dead yet.
 Well, I don’t really want to say it to them, I mean, they’ve got their lives, their maggoty little lives, and they’ve got these things they want to say and I say, god bless them.
 But, in the end, fuck ‘em if they can’t take a joke.
 But, back to the song, here are the elements present in between the lines: candlelight, a picture of Tristan Tzara that was on Lor’s wall, post-orgasmic lassitude, the sound a needle makes stuck in the endgrooves of an LP, and, finally and most importunately, the sight of my woman’s incredible ass, naked beside me.

Then I gobbled two jumbo hamburgers and spent the night consuming aspirins, with my head on two pillows because one alone felt hard as pavement.
 The next day, after Spanish class on Friday, I recounted my ordeal to Karen and explained that all my suffering certainly must have earned me her company at the movies.
 She congenially disagreed.
 While Eric and I drank bourbon and ginger ale, I griped about Karen.
 At first I acted tough and unruffled, but soon the bourbon took hold, and I confessed the pain in my gut that had nothing to do with fasting.
 He asked why I got so obsessed about Karen, knowing I never had pursued anybody else so boldly.
 Should anybody except Karen want a date with me, she had better tell her friend to pass the word along.
 I wouldn’t even ask any other girl for a dance without having already gotten the nod.
 Karen had pink, full lips and plenty of curves, and lively unhaunted eyes.
 She read books for fun and spoke softly, humbly, and acted just as nice to the lowly as to teachers or big shots.

I was a little hungry, but the pangs were a distant kind of discomfort.
 The real suffering for not eating wouldn't come into play until we hit the tutoring lab.
 Oh well, when I got home ravenous and ate a decent-sized meal Mom would probably be ecstatic.
 Or too wrapped up in some project to even notice.
 It was hard enough anticipating what I was going to do from day to day.
 Trying to figure Mom out was truly futile.
 Being held up by Mrs. Campbell at least had one advantage; the line for Britney to get food was nearly non-existent.
 Britney was talking again, but it was still the kinds of things I could respond to with half my attention.

I find myself creeping back until I could barely see the scene below.
 I was afraid that it would see me.
 Then I got a glimpse of what it had killed and I had to hold back my tears.
 The poor body of the dwarf who had brought us here was lying in a contorted heap, limbs twisted in all directions.
 The scene was awful and I had to prevent myself from throwing up.
 Then I knew why they beat and killed him.
 All the other dwarves were on Kojas.
 This dwarf must have betrayed Kojas to bring information to whoever “her majesty” was and to help us into Igneeria.
 I suddenly knew that this dwarf was much braver than we had given him credit for.

Apparently Brandon's charms were enough to make Mom forget herself while he was around, but not so great as to keep her from worrying when he wasn't.
 I shrugged uncomfortably.
 "He's not my boyfriend, Mom.

 Mom looked away from the skyline, a new batch of concern painted across her features.
 "I'm so sorry, dear.

Gently disengaging her arms, he took the ring from the box and slid it onto her finger.
 "I love you, Marie."
 "I love you too."
 Marie walked and danced on air that evening.
 Davis had kissed her after putting the ring on her finger, and then he'd taken her to the same club they'd gone to the previous week.
 They ran into some friends of hers, and she introduced him as her betrothed.
 And he kissed her twice more--once as he helped her into his automobile when they left the club and again when he said goodnight to her.
 Now that they were betrothed, maybe he'd kiss her all the time.

 On his way back home, the threepence jingling in his hand, Harruq spotted a patrol of guards approaching.
 He glanced to the right, where the small alley led back to their shed.
 If he hurried, he might be able to make it before they noticed…
 He was halfway down the alley when he heard a voice call out.
 “Hey!”
 Harruq kept going.
 He was used to harassment and verbal abuse from the guards.

She even smiled as she handed me a green, laminated card.
 "You'll need to pick out an empty table, we don't let students share here.
 Also I'd recommend choosing one somewhat distant from Ms. Samuels, she doesn't need any more distractions than she already has.
 When you have a question, or need help from one of the tutors, flip the card over to the red side and place it on your desk."
 I nodded and headed over to a table near the girl, one where I could watch her without her seeing me.
 I wasn't going to fall all over myself to become her friend or anything, but I figured it was worth observing her for a little bit.
 If she really was cool then we might strike up a friendship at some point.
 If she wasn't, then the sooner I could confirm that fact the better off I'd be.

She turned to Rodregas; her eyebrows arched high in surprise and said, “A ley line and powerful?
 I knew there were several going through the Aridas, but your little abandoned farm is next to a ley line?” she asked.
 “Actually,” Rodregas said, “it is right in the middle of it, and there is even a small undercurrent suggesting that another weaker one crosses at the farm point.” Rodregas explained, “I had been on the run when we found this place.
 I had been worried that those tracking me were using magic.
 So to keep them off my track I traveled in and out of ley lines to throw off the magic scent.
 This one runs underground before coming out in this small valley.

 That is how I found the old farmhouse.” Ley lines are like rivers of magic energy that encircle the world.

They moved about the camp slowly.
 Clearly they had no magic, and they definitely were the owners of the crude tools we had found.
 They spoke to each other often, their voices like the protest of an old hound.
 I watched until nightfall, when they settled into tents and lean-tos.
 They seemed to assign a watchman, wielding only a torch lit from the central fire.
 I slipped down from the tree and returned to the castle.

The great outer courtyard and been marked off with chalk into ten squares.
 The contestants stood around the squares waiting their turn to enter.
 They would push anyone falling out back into the squares.
 Watchers were not allowed around the squares.
 Rodregas knew Imeralda and Doi’van were atop the wall, the closest spot allowed for spectators.
 Two contestants had already fought.
 The rules were simple.
 Two went in and one came out walking.
 The constants were bare of chest and foot.
 There were no fancy speeches to start the match, a bell sounded and the next round began.

Jim – No, other people bought some of those…
 Liz – well that’s not so bad as I thought…
 Jim – She took the ones that we bought him back to the stores, and the rest she gave to the rest of it all to the Salvation Army.
 She told him “those things were too good for someone as worthless as him.”  He must have cried for a month afterwards.
 That was just one event.
 She told him that sort of thing all his life, when she wasn’t trying to control all of our lives.
 She ground him into the dirt at every opportunity.
 Liz – How did you and your father get through it when poor Johnny didn’t?
 Jim – Dad spent a lot of time at work.
 There were some weeks when he was working 60 hours or more.

Rick watched the emotions play across her face.
 "What isn't my fault?"
 he repeated, his forefinger tracing a path along her throat up to her chin.
 She swallowed.
 "That-that I can't go through with it."
 His finger froze.
 "I'm sorry--I should never have pushed you.
 I know that you're engaged, and I know--" "But that's it.
 That's what I'm talking about.
 I can't marry Davis."

Then, what rock did, after Rickie and Buddy and those guys, rock got a conscience.
 Partly Dylan’s doing, but it was inevitable, it was headed that way, the power of it, the communicative power.
 Man, I sound like Rolling Stone.
 What I mean is that rock wouldn’t have held it’s place if it hadn’t shifted, if the words didn’t start to mean something.
 It was time.
 It was time for music to mean something.
 Dylan, The Beatles, they led the way.
 They said, you know, show us the plan, you don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.

5.Privatize and develop road transport: Transportation is a major bottleneck to development of a market economy in much of the region.
 Under the centrally planned system, most freight was hauled by trains over main routes to large cities for distribution in bulk by huge government procurement agencies.
 Under a market system, millions of small producers and consumers must be free to buy or sell wherever the price is most attractive.
 This requires a vast proliferation of small goods transporters in the private sector, which are rare in many countries today.
 The large freight transport monopolies have to be replaced by entrepreneurial companies with small fleets competing for freight business.
 Immediate steps are needed to expand capacity and introduce competition in this vital sector by promoting the development of private road transport companies at the national, regional and local level.
 Special loan and leasing programmes should be established to enable small firms and individuals to purchase vehicles and pay for them out of the revenues generated from use.
 6.Regional models and pilot programmes: Pioneering initiatives need to be encouraged to act as demonstrations and catalysts for new types of activities in the country.
 In a region as vast and diverse as this and in countries such as Russia, which extends over eleven time zones, no single model or pattern will be widely applicable.
 Therefore, several areas in each country representing different economic and social conditions should be selected for establishment of model transition programmes.

I wanted to scream, but the words wouldn’t come.
 I was too drained.
 And I was scared.
 I didn’t know what had happened, what was wrong with me, but I was certain whatever it was, Chevelle would take me straight back to the village.
 We stayed there for some time, a fact for which I was grateful.
 Even though whatever had happened seemed to have passed, neither man seemed in a hurry to go.
 Chevelle glanced at me occasionally but kept himself busy around the fire.
 Steed still played with his feather, eventually entertaining me with it.
 It spun toward me and turned down, tickling my arm and then my nose.
 I giggled despite my wariness, and reached up to rub my nose where the plume had brushed it.

We had Brandon on complete lockdown at our house with no visitors allowed, searching his room and the entire house daily.
 We ordered professional quality drug tests so we could test him every day.
 Brandon experienced the worst of the drug withdrawals in the first few days after his arrest.
 My wife, Lisa sat on the bathroom floor with him during his lowest moments.
 He vomited until he had nothing left.
 He curled up in the fetal position, chanting inaudible ramblings and contorting to the point that we had to pad the doorframe and cabinets with towels to keep him from banging his head and limbs.
 In the twelfth hour of fetal position rocking, infantile whimpering, sickening dry heaves and panicked breathing, I broke out my video camera, thinking I’d just tape a reminder: He can’t possibly ever want to do this again.
 His mother on the bathroom floor alongside him, cushioning his head before it smacks the doorframe, stroking his back and newly shorn hair.
 I am defined again by this moment, disgusted by myself, but in a warped way triumphant: You see, you see you little shit— what happens when you don’t listen to me?
 He was a walking skeleton and you could see his every rib.

When it became clear that you were not, I stopped trying to kill you.” He paused at this, and then Rodregas could tell he made a decision.
 “You have given me a sword, if a small one, and among my people that is a powerful gesture.
 I will not lie to you, I have left my old life behind and the last few years I have learned to truly hate the Immortalists.
 I travel with you only because the others were going to go back to their homes, and I have no home to go back to,” he seemed to finish, but then added, “Last night you pointed out that the forces of the Immortalists would be after you and you would fight them.
 And you also proved that you can fight.” Once again he paused.
 He was clearly a man that liked to think before he spoke.
 “I am simply using you as bait.
 When they come for you, I will kill them.
 Fighting together we will kill some of their vaulted Immortal Guards.” As Doi’van finished he gave a low growl and shook his horned head, his thick mane of wild jet black hair was almost as distinctive as Imeralda’s own auburn flowing locks.
 But with Doi’van the gesture spoke of defiance and challenge like some great bull lowing his horns and getting ready to charge.

The parts of me that weren't emotionally dead, that were still behaving rationally despite the accident, were screaming in terror.
 There probably wasn't anyone in the school who knew less about fighting than me.
 I knew I should turn around and run away before Cassie realized I was serious, but somehow I didn't care.
 Cassie's arsenal of nasty tricks wouldn't be so effective against someone who'd already been kicked out of their house and moved to another state.
 All I really needed to do was survive the next few minutes.
 I'd be out of the state before she really got busy making my life miserable.
 A dozen different things I could say blew through my mind, but they were all competing, and none of them fit the situation.
 In typical fashion, I found myself without anything clever to say.
 Instead I just stood there and stared at Cassie.
 I'd thought things were tense already, but where everyone had been quiet before, now they were motionless too.

It was possible she'd just gone to the restroom.
 I tried to remind myself of all of the places she could be, and all of the reasons she might have left that didn't involve abandoning me here.
 Rachel met me on my way back to my table to gather up my books.
 "She left with Rick Anders."
 I mustered a grin.
 "Was my panic that obvious?"
 "No, I was just watching her to see who she had in her sights for the Ashure Day Dance.
 Then when I saw her leave I realized that would mean you wouldn't have a ride home."
 I put the last couple of books in my backpack and shrugged.
 "I think she's mad.

His speed far beyond the guard’s, he knocked the stab away, then shifted his weight so that both Salvation and Condemnation blocked the other attack.
 The weaker blade shattered against the magic of the twin swords.
 One weaponless and the other horribly positioned, the two were defenseless.
 Salvation took a throat.
 Condemnation pierced rib and lung.
 Harruq ripped his blade out of the guard’s chest and shoved the body to the side.
 The dying heap of flesh collided against two other men, knocking them back and delaying their attack.
 He mocked them, adrenaline flooding his veins.
 “Is that all you can do?” he screamed.

Namely the fact that tomorrow I would have to go enroll in school and try to blend in with a bunch of small-town juniors who'd all probably known each other since they could walk.
 Going to a new school after missing the first month of classes was a prospect likely to generate anxiety in the most outgoing of teenagers, and I was far from that, but it was a different kind of worry.
 As I mapped out all of the things that could, and probably would, go wrong, I could feel my heart slowly settle back down out of my throat.
 If I were pretty or athletic I'd probably manage to fit right in.
 It always seemed like the kids who moved in partway through the year usually had some kind of instant in with the cool crowd, but that probably wouldn't happen for me.
 It wasn't that I didn't want to make friends; I just wasn't very good at it.
 My equilibrium seemed to have returned, so I took a few unsteady steps around to the back of the truck.
 If I didn't return with a box soon Mom would rush out expecting the worst.
 Unless she got caught up visualizing some new project, in which case it would be hours before she thought to come check on me.
 We'd moved the beds and most of the other heavy items in earlier, which helped explain my exhaustion, but that didn't make the pile of remaining items in the back of the truck any less foreboding.

Chapter 23 Someone was calling my name, but I really didn't want to wake up.
 I was still so tired, and I'd had the most wonderful dreams.
 They were a little foggy now, but they seemed to have involved Alec coming to my rescue, and then holding my hand as I went to sleep.
 It wasn't until I finally placed the familiar voice that everything started coming back to me.
 I sat up with an abruptness that nearly knocked Alec off of his perch on the edge of my bed.
 Him still being there, looking at me with a barely restrained amusement glimmering in his eyes, calmed my racing pulse.
 "You're still here."
 "You sound disappointed.
 Do you want me to leave?"
 His expression had taken on the guarded blankness I still hadn't learned how to read, so I wasn't sure whether he was joking or not.

I wish we could do something.“ Rodregas nodded his understanding and said, “I wish we could, but the three of us against a score, the chances of our success is far smaller than the chances of our death.” He stated in the ‘matter of fact’ sergeant voice that he knew people would follow.
 Rodregas stood up and started to turn, but while Doi’van stood he faced the road and he said, “I have been on this road before, though I did not know then that it was called ‘The Princess Road.’ To me it was a road of sorrow.” Doi’van was using that flat voice that he used when stating facts.
 “Rodregas, you said our odds are bad, but how long shall we wait for the odds to be good?” Doi’van’s voice dropped the flat tone and started to sound like rocks groaning deep in the earth, as if a great earthquake was coming, “You believe that a god of the Celestials is behind your survival and that this god wants to see us fight the Immortalists.
 I spent two years of my life in the Menagerie, I swore to myself that given a chance I would see no others be enslaved by the Lord Taiga.” Doi’van continued speaking with the same tone as if the earth shook, “I know these caravans.
 The guards will be mostly badly trained human scum armed in leather and with weapons of simple steel.
 The Immortalist scouts are another matter.
 They will be highly trained but still the lowest of the Immortal Guards, mostly with just one or two of the lesser sigils such as strength or one that gives him enhanced senses.
 Against the three of us, a Forest Nymph with a powerful Black Yew bow and a Hellborn Prince of the Orqui and a warrior empowered with a Celestial Lion, are the odds truly that bad?” Rodregas stood still, surprised by Doi’van’s words.
 In truth he did not know how good or bad their odds were.
 He knew they were not good, but his mind did not spin with the odds.

Agenda for a Global Employment Programme
 Employment is a global problem that cannot be fully solved by individual countries in isolation.
 Policy measures at the national level influence trade and investment flows and employment rates in other countries.
 Economic growth and expansion of employment in one country enhance employment opportunities in other countries as well.
 Therefore, co ordination of policies is in the interests of the global community.
 A comprehensive and coordinated international effort is called for to improve the global climate for economic growth and job creation by evolving stable and supportive policies to regulate capital flows, foreign trade, debt, commodity pricing, immigration and labour movements, transfer of technology, investment, military spending and the arms trade.
 We set forth below a broad policy framework to stimulate global job growth with the aim of achieving full employment early in the twenty-first century.
 1.World Employment Programme: Raising incomes and creating jobs in the developing countries is the best way to promote global economic growth and employment generation in the coming decades.
 The World Summit on Social Development should call for a comprehensive World Employment Programme to stimulate more rapid growth in developing countries as an engine for global economic expansion.
 The International Labour Organization has operated a programme for the past two decades, but solution of the employment problem requires an integrated approach that transcends the scope of any single international agency.

Just promise to bring it back in the same condition.
 Remember, I'm less concerned with your answer, and more interested in the process you take to try and solve the problem.
 Of course the right answer never hurts."
 I smiled and hurried out of class with a 'thank you'.
 I shouldn't have bothered rushing.
 I slipped into Spanish exactly three seconds before the late bell sounded, but Mrs. Tiggs wasn't even there.
 When she finally did show up, we had a surprise quiz on our vocabulary.
 Once we finished she turned on the television and told us to listen for conjugation.
 I almost wished I shared the class with Britney, her dad seemed like the type to get six kinds of riled up over something like that.
 He'd probably go straight to the school board and demand a new Spanish teacher altogether.

Rodregas raised his arm up and threw his club forward with all his strength.
 There was no time to see if his club hit Junnit or if the half AElfin maiden ran.
 Rodregas half ran and half jumped to the next circle, where Ravenhurr stood with raised arms.
 Ravenhurr was focused on his inner magic and was not prepared for his own guards’ sudden action.
 Rodregas grabbed Ravenhurr’s arm and his belt, and using his weight and momentum against Ravenhurr, threw him bodily into the circle of colorful crystals where the half AElf maiden had stood moments ago.
 Ravenhurr, in an amazing act of balance, almost caught himself.
 He seemed to defy gravity as he hung in the air.
 Rodregas tried to reach out to push Ravenhurr into the circle, but before his hand touched the sorcerer, Ravenhurr lost his balance and fell into the circle.
 The moment that Ravenhurr crossed into the circle he started to burn.
 His body twisted in pain as he burned the same blue fire of creation that he had called forth to rip apart a man’s soul and steal the physical essence of a Celestial Lion.

When Mother Teresa entered at the rear of a procession of sisters and escorts, I sneered at the rubber-neckers, asking myself why these folks didn't comprehend that to worship a human offended God.
 The question was rhetorical.
 Obviously, people acted so boorishly because they weren't as cool or enlightened as me.
 During mass, I considered the priest's accent monotonous and uninspired, as though after forty years of mouthing the same lines, it all sounded to him like blah blah blah.
 Attending Catholic services, communion tries my patience, as I'm not allowed to participate.
 But while a young woman read, “He took bread, gave thanks and broke it and gave it to them, saying, ‘This is my body given for you.

 Though he was trying to go slowly, they quickly found themselves naked.
 He thought if he had let her, she would have jumped right on him and slid himself inside her.
 Rodregas knew that Nymphs were legendary for their enjoyment of sex, but he was a little surprised at her eagerness.
 She ran her hands and lips across his chest, seemingly fascinated by ‘his’ powerful musculature and smooth skin.
 Once again Rodregas found himself pulling away from her touch.
 He had never really had a woman that eager to touch him before.
 Her eagerness to touch his body made him feel a little put off.
 It was good to be touched, in fact, he craved it.
 But her eagerness highlighted to him that the body she wanted to touch was not really his.

A thin painted vine trailed up to her thigh.
 She noticed me looking.
 “Well, Frey, I feel like I know so much about you.” She smiled slyly at Chevelle.
 “But you know so little of me.

 Ruby continued without pause.
 “I’m sure you’ve heard by now I’m an amalgamation, a half-breed.” She said the last part with distaste and glanced at Steed.
 “I will give you a short version of events so when the subject comes up—and believe me, someone will ask—you are not overcome by curiosity and forced to seek less than honorable venues to discover the facts.” I chose to ignore the jab about my eavesdropping.

The effort of the international community to deal with these events has brought to the fore fundamental issues regarding national sovereignty and the responsibilities of the world community.
 The very definition and sanctity of the state have been blurred by the determination of ethnic groups in various nations to declare independence from their parent bodies, and the inability or unwillingness of national governments to maintain law and order and provide basic security for their citizens.
 The role of other states, regional organizations and international agencies in giving explicit or implicit support to these movements has further complicated the task of formulating just and practical solutions.
 These events raise questions about the rights of both nations and their citizens that have to be addressed theoretically before the role of international organizations in these affairs can be determined properly.
 Does a minority group within a country have the right to proclaim itself independent on the basis of its desire for self-governance and in defiance of the claims of the majority on the property and resources they possess?
 Does a national government, whether elected or in power by force, that is unable to protect its citizens against famine and civil strife have the right to insist on its sovereignty and independent action in the face of the persecution or extermination of its own people?
 What is the responsibility of the international community for preventing or alleviating crises within societies?
 What should be the limits placed on international involvement in the internal affairs of countries that, at least momentarily, are unable to help themselves?
 The sanctity of the sovereign state, like the sanctity of private property in a capitalist society, is a fundamental principle of the nation state system on which the present world community is based.
 Like the protectors of private property, the guardians of the sovereign state vigorously resist each attempt to limit its scope or qualify its power – although in both instances there are obvious and well-recognized limits and qualifications.

I'd actually been trying to sneak a look in the mirror to find out how everything was shaping up, but it wasn't worth trying to explain.
 With the pall that'd descended over the pack once we'd made it back, it was almost certain she wouldn't believe me.
 Nobody even knew where we'd gone, but they'd keyed off of our mood faster than I would've believed possible.
 The results hadn't been good.
 Jasmin stepped back around behind Dominic as I was watching, and for the first time I got a good idea of how the massively piled style Jasmin had been working on for the last half hour was going to turn out.
 Dominic frowned at my gasp.
 "Oh no, I really look that horrid?"

I moved closer to the window, finding a larger gap there.
 “Were you able to track her?” Junnie asked in a low voice.
 “Not exactly.
 She’s following me.” Heat flooded my face.
 I couldn’t believe he’d fooled me again.
 I didn’t care what else they had to say.
 I stood and marched away, fuming at the idea that both of them were in on it.
 They might have been council, but it didn’t stop the feeling of betrayal.
 They’d lied to me, acted as if they’d cared.
 I was done with them.

Understanding came suddenly and would not be denied.
 I scoffed at myself humorlessly as my words taunted me—just harmless fun… what could it hurt?
 For half a second, I wanted to scream.
 And then my hands found their way to my stomach and rested there.
 I drew in a sharp intake of breath.
 I hadn’t noticed I had gotten so deeply involved in the story.
 I needed to rest, to finish my recovery and break the bonds.
 But I couldn’t seem to step away.

He shook his head, leaning back.
 "Just wait.

 "That really inspires me to want to get married."
 The phone rang, and Ted left as Rick picked it up.

Brandon: Sadly, as he neared the 2-year sobriety mark, Brandon relapsed.
 I immediately knew just by talking to him over the phone.
 I wouldn’t have noticed the changes in his behavior had I not come to know the new sober Brandon after his treatment at Narconon and his subsequent employment at the facility.
 Brandon reluctantly agreed to return to Narconon to try to discover “what he had missed” but he didn’t go easily.
 Drug addicts are convinced that they can handle the issue themselves and believing that lie could prove deadly for them.
 Brandon spent three more months in treatment and is now trying again, living independently in a sober-living environment.
 Another defining moment for all of us.
 We hope and pray that Brandon will use the tools he has been taught to navigate through this world where drugs and alcohol are abundant and easy to obtain where ever you live and no matter who you are with.
 Brandon needs to have the strength and desire to embrace his new healthy body and see the ramifications of destroying himself and his family if he chooses to return to drugs.

He'd pressed objects into Dom and Jasmin's hands, and then brushed his lips across the back of my hand.
 He slipped away, and then we'd entered a brightly-lit room filled with the rest of the pack.
 Alec had picked me up and carried me out to a massive SUV that I'd never seen before.
 Everyone piled in, and despite the seriousness of rapidly approaching events, I fell back asleep somewhere en route to our destination.
 Apparently you couldn't drive all the way though, because we were walking again, or at least some of us were.
 I could just make out Isaac off a little ways into the darkness.
 He was in hybrid form and moving with a ground-devouring gait that was deceptively smooth.
 Flashes of movement off to either side of us, lower to the ground, made me sure the girls were all following along on four legs.
 Alec shifted me around as he realized I was awake.
 "We've still got nearly half an hour, you should get some more sleep if you can."

You wanted so badly to go home."
 He gazed down into her eyes.
 "You loved me, and you were completely torn apart, yet you wanted to go home so badly that you left me.
 What happened?"
 Tears shimmered in her eyes.
 "I was miserable.
 I mean, I was really happy to see my family, and we felt closer than ever.
 They thought I'd been kidnapped at first, but when there was no ransom request, they were afraid I'd been murdered.
 They were out of their minds.

 Mrs. Tranton sat down on the bed.

My mouth tasted sour.
 I tried to sit up but my head spun.
 Before I’d moved an inch I was back down.
 My pulse pounded in my temples as I struggled to recall what had happened the night before.
 I hissed out a low oath when I remembered Ruby leaning toward me, blowing her glitter in my face.
 My eyes opened again to find Chevelle offering me a glass.
 I winced, unsure of what exactly I had said to him.
 I knew it was bad, but couldn’t quite piece it back together.
 I glanced up at him timidly.
 “Thank you,” I croaked as I took the cup, my hand trembling.

My fingernails cut into the palm of my hand where the map had been.
 We’d be traveling to the peak, they’d said.
 I couldn’t guess what waited there, but that didn’t stop the hope that it was something of my mother, my family.
 But even if it wasn’t, I’d be that much farther away from the village and council.
 The second bit of Ruby’s parting comment registered, so I excused myself to her room with a yawn and a short good night.
 I closed the door behind me, and though tired, knew I wouldn’t sleep with him in the next room.
 I walked to the back window and stared out into the night.
 Moonlight glinted off Ruby’s figure in the distance, heading away from the village.
 I didn’t think.
 I just pulled a cloak from the pile on her bed and was out the hidden door behind the wardrobe.

The establishment of secure foundations for peace will be aided by development and post-conflict peace building.
 Yet if there is a growing international consensus on the peace operations undertaken by the United Nations, there is no such consensus on its developmental work.
 Indeed, this lack of a consensus reflects a worldwide crisis in the field of development economics.
 As development becomes imperative, as we approach the turn of this century, we are faced with the necessity of giving new meaning to the word.
 Reflecting on development is thus, in my opinion, the most important intellectual challenge of the coming years.
 Already, it seems clear that macro-economic growth can no longer be deemed sufficient for development purposes.
 Countries pursuing macro-economic growth paths have the necessary foundations for development, but that is only the first part.
 There can be no lasting development with the exclusion of social groups from the fruits of growth.
 Nor can there be long-term prospects for development when the environment is pillaged and the rights of future generations ignored.
 Finally, growth which is not accompanied by the improve ment of the social fabric of society will be only a hollow shell.

Chevelle’s horse whinnied as they rode away.
 “Why always the face?” I yelled at his back.
 I winced as a second branch, this one young and green and more like a lash, struck me from behind.
 A fierce growl escaped me and I took off, running at full speed in the direction my horse had gone.
 By midday, I was completely spent.
 I had eventually caught my horse, but the training hadn’t let up.
 I was too exhausted for any anger to remain, but I had the sneaking suspicion Chevelle was enjoying my “lessons.” We stopped by a patch of snow that had gathered in a rock basin, warming it to water for the horses.
 Chevelle jumped down from his horse as I melted off the side of mine and onto a rock, my limbs like molasses.
 He came to sit across from me and I flinched, expecting another attack.
 He smiled.

Seth made a cat noise and clawed the air, “Someone's a pussy cat today.” “Be quiet Seth or she'll hurt you,” I said and looked over my shoulder.
 Emily seemed to have heard that and she winked at me.
 I smiled and winked back.
 “Seth I'd be really careful.” Seth snorted, “I'm not scared of her.” “I would be,” I said and had to fight another smile.
 I could tell it was getting past noon because the air started to get cooler.
 I was suddenly really jealous of Emily's long robe.
 I also was getting hungry and wondered if there was any way to get food in Igneeria.
 A huge rumble startled me and I looked up at the sky.
 We were in a clearing and I could see the sky clearly.
 Dark clouds covered the sky and a rumble shook the air again.

He ended up with a pile of clothes.
 Some were fancy, but none would be of much use on the road and none were worth selling.
 Next, Rodregas went to the wardrobe, which was engraved with the shape of trees and made of a sweet smelling wood.
 It was much more likely to hold something of value.
 He opened the doors to see brightly colored robes, and there on the left was a suit of chain mail.
 Rodregas could feel his smile.
 Armor!
 He reached in and pulled it out.
 The chain mail was light and seemed to flow around his fingers; the links seemed to be made of silver and he recognized it as Mithril.
 Ravenhurr had a suit of Mithril chain; he could feel his heart start to beat in excitement.

I knew I should be happy for Pam, but I was too busy wishing everyone would quiet down so we could hear the next name.
 Mrs. Alexander shut the door, muting the roar as Principal Gossil continued with a slight rustle of papers.
 "Also winning a ticket to Les Misérables next weekend, Mr. Andrew Webbs."
 A couple of half-hearted cheers broke out towards the front of the class, but they were short-lived.
 Andrew wasn't in the class, and his friends were probably spending almost as much time thinking about their odds of still winning, as I was.
 I only had three chances left, three in two hundred assuming that everyone else in the school had entered the drawing, which was virtually guaranteed.
 "And the third lucky person is Suzanne Bergerman."
 And my chances were down to two, with even worse odds than I'd had a second before.
 My hands hurt, only when I looked down to see why, it was because my fingernails were digging into my palms.
 The blood was pounding so furiously in my ears that I couldn't hear the next name read.

 Rachel glared at me for several seconds, and then suddenly smiled.
 "Okay, Adri.
 I mean I was just trying to do something nice for you, but if you're going to be like that, we'll leave it here."
 Her grin didn't engender trust, but when I opened my mouth to call her on it, she forestalled me with an upraised hand.
 "I swear.
 We'll go home and leave the dress here."
 The pout came back out for a moment.
 "But, if you're not going to let me buy this for you, I'm going to need to compensate by buying something for Jasmin."
 Rachel flounced off, followed by a frowning Jasmin, leaving Dominic to help me out of the straitjacket I was currently using as a dress.

Give us half an hour, and then ask Donovan to show you the way."
 I felt my face break into a huge smile, but he held a hand up to forestall my thanks.
 "This is all still very much against my better judgment, but I'm finding it increasingly hard to refuse you the things you want the most."
 "Somehow I find that hard to believe.
 Even if it were true, you're hardly the type to give away the upper hand by coming out and telling me so."
 Alec's eyes had taken on the serious, resigned expression that'd become disturbingly commonplace lately.
 "I know.
 I think that last part bothers me the most, but I find myself doing so nevertheless.

This guard did.
 The Immortal Guard had already launched himself forward and Rodregas’ own speed worked against him.
 As Rodregas’ short sword hit nothing but air, he felt the sharp agony of the guard’s blade piercing his thigh.
 Rodregas used his speed to throw himself back.
 But as he did, he felt another sharp cut hit his upper arm.
 The other men were moving in now that he was off balance.
 Rodregas twisted as he fell and grabbed one of the slavers and brought him down.
 With a quick stab into his groin, Rodregas took the slaver out of commission.
 Rodregas rolled off his squirming body and threw himself up to a standing position.
 He almost immediately went down again as his wounded thigh buckled under him.

 It was a moment for my wife and me and everyone around us knew how special it was.
 Brandon was now over 180 pounds, which filled out his 6’2” frame well.
 He was working out daily and they were obviously feeding him well.
 Brandon was physically and mentally a different person.
 We would later joke that Brandon was so different from the person who we had known as a son these last few years that we should re-name him.
 Brandon was accepted to the internship program which would last another 3 months.
 First, he returned home for a week to help go through his belongings that we had placed in storage.
 We ended up throwing away 90% of this junk, as he really didn’t want much of it anyway.
 Rummaging through his old belongings was a grim reminder of his former life.

The good news was that they both seemed very full, and if anything, had a sleepy look to them.
 Rodregas guessed that he had awakened them from a nap.
 Rodregas had to remind himself that he needed to develop an understanding with the lionesses.
 Predators like them worked on a very simple alpha relationship; the strong ruled.
 They were Dire beasts, but he was the equivalent of a Celestial Beast.
 He was alpha; pound for pound Rodregas would be stronger and quicker than even these two beasts.
 Of course, each animal seemed to weigh almost twice as much as he did.
 Still, Rodregas knew with sudden clarity that he needed to establish himself as the one in charge.
 If he did not establish his leadership, the next time the Dire Cats were hungry they would try eating one of his party, or at least one of the horses.
 Rodregas walked over to the bear corpse and as he approached, both cats seemed to fully wake up and took on a crouch stance.

 She knew their roles, the balance and position of their hearts.
 It was absurd, poor souls without a home, family, or position to be speaking of power and obligation.
 Her hatred of their unknown master grew.
 He was a puppet-master, and her dear friend was one of his puppets.

“Why?” “It might lead up somewhere.
 Plus, if Jason and Emily see it too, they might go down.

 I brushed the dirt off my pants and followed Seth, who was walking off to the side.
 He went down to the left of the ledge and followed a steep path.
 I walked behind him and had to dig my heels in to avoid from slipping down.
 The path ended and Seth had to jump down to reach the bottom.
 He landed gracefully but almost tripped.

In recognition of the mutual suspicions between Russia and the Western powers, the rule of unanimity usually adopted by political conferences was applied to decisions made by the five major powers that became the permanent members of the Security Council.
 The rest of the world was poorly represented.
 Only 51 nations – including only two African states, two East Asian nations and three Soviet republics – out of the current total of 184 UN members were present at its founding.
 This structure is based on political realities that no longer hold true.
 As the limitations of the League led to renewed conflagration two decades later, so the arrangements underlying the establishment of the UN contained within them the seeds of the confrontation between the superpowers and the Cold War.
 The present international system of governance is as far from being truly representative and ‘democratic’ as many erstwhile authoritarian governments that incorporated the popular adjective in the names of their parties or states.
 The UN Charter assigns primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security to the Security Council of 15 members, of whom five are permanent members with veto power over all matters.
 In no other constitution or organization founded on democratic principles is it accepted that a few members may thus invalidate the decisions of the majority.
 The General Assembly, in which all members are represented and which is headed by an elected Secretary, is only an advisory body, constituted to ‘discuss any questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security’ and to ‘make recommendations with regard to any such questions to the state or states concerned or to the Security Council or both’.
 This authorization is restricted by the provision that in regard to any dispute or situation in which the Security Council is exercising its functions under the Charter, the General Assembly will not make any recommendations with regard to the dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.

That last part sounded pretty weak even to me.
 "Don't be silly.
 Alec hustled you out of your house so quickly you didn't get to bring anything but the clothes on your back.
 Jasmin's clothes will fit you pretty well, but that's only a short-term solution.
 We need to get you stuff to wear, and since it was Alec who created this mess, it's only fair he be the one to pay."
 I was absolutely sure there was no way I was ever going to fit into anything Jasmin owned, but girls being girls, there was no point in protesting.
 Regardless of the truth, Rachel would be obliged to say I was just as skinny as Jasmin.

He complimented me on holding my ground so firmly.
 In fact, he and his partner asked me if I had done this before because I was so stern with her and refused to bend.
 I guess they were accustomed to dealing with strung out drug addicts.
 I was still completely disappointed and I told them so.
 I just wanted this over and I had every expectation that it would be finished tonight and I could get on with my life and my son could get on with rehab and hopefully get healthy.
 Once I was un-wired I was able to call my wife who was a sobbing mess.
 Not hearing from me and the uncertainty of the night had taken its toll on her and my son.
 I headed home defeated and unsure if I would ever get the opportunity to complete the task that would free my son from a three to five year prison term.
 I was mentally exhausted and I didn’t know what my next move would be.

Ok, yeah, so I was playing this Elvis song for my friends and some teacher heard it and blew a gasket.
 (laughs)   I mean, I guess “Baby, let’s play house,” is not something you expect a little boy to sing to a little girl.
 And I got my uke taken from me and a call was made to my parents.
 My mom hit the roof—she was the kind that got embarrassed by such things and that, to her, was the ultimate disgrace, to be shown up in front of other grownups.
 My mom threatened to smash my uke and Dad had to cool her down and, I think, it was later that night I got it back.
 I started right in, learning new songs.
 Thinking up new songs.
 I had this record player, you know, with the lid and the swivel arm made of plastic, and a stack of 45s, some I bought at Corondolet in a sealed stack—you know?

Perhaps she saw the elf in Harruq while Dieredon saw the orc.
 The kindest man might become a brute when surrounded by other brutes.
 When Harruq was with his brother, or the strange man in black, how then did he behave?
 Could he kill?
 Could he murder?
 She had to know.
 It took a simple invisibility spell to approach their rundown home unnoticed, her feet moving silently because of her natural elven grace.
 It was midday and the sun was high in the sky.

But do you remember what dad and other people said about him?
 Johnny – All I know is that he was supposed to be a religious lunatic.
 Jim – That he was.
 He had started his own church somewhere out West.
 Something having to do with Jesus coming back and drop-kicking all the sinners into hell, with the help of the truly faithful of course.
 He was pretty much crazy.
 Johnny – And we’re related to him.
 Jim – Yes we are.
 Course it didn’t make him all that happy.
 That and he hated dad from the beginning because dad isn’t a religious person, and that dad had the audacity to question anything grandpa said.

Rodregas was not as familiar with the daemons of the Infernal Realms as he was the great beasts of the Celestial Realm.
 He sat looking at a wolf with the tail of a serpent but with large beautiful white wings.
 Then he slowly walked next to a great bull with bat wings and a head that appeared to be very human.
 While he had been drawn to the Chamber both figures repulsed him.
 They mocked the natural order.
 It was  not just that they seemed to combine multiple unconnected animals, but the size and shapes were simply wrong.
 Rodregas looked up from his examination of a strange bull daemon and looked for Doi’van.
 He must have been more familiar with the powers of the various creatures.
 Doi’van had walked past many of the figures until he stood at one toward the back.
 The shape was a powerfully built dragon with wings partially spread as if getting ready to fly.

"Don't be silly.
 Alec hustled you out of your house so quickly you didn't get to bring anything but the clothes on your back.
 Jasmin's clothes will fit you pretty well, but that's only a short-term solution.
 We need to get you stuff to wear, and since it was Alec who created this mess, it's only fair he be the one to pay."
 I was absolutely sure there was no way I was ever going to fit into anything Jasmin owned, but girls being girls, there was no point in protesting.
 Regardless of the truth, Rachel would be obliged to say I was just as skinny as Jasmin.
 "I don't think Alec exactly got me into all of this.
 It was more like my own stupidity that landed me in this particular batch of trouble."
 "Please, as if any girl who didn't know what a jerk Brandon was would've done anything different.

My son produced a crumpled receipt and for a couple hundred dollars we reclaimed his dream camera.
 I thought this camera meant the world to him.
 The camera was apparently second and last to his need for drugs—duh— like everything else.
 I knew I couldn’t be the first parent who paid off the loan on a child’s prized belongings.
 I did know that it would remain my camera until he could pay back everything he owed and prove to me he was sober.
 It broke my heart that I was retrieving something from hock that we had given him as the perfect gift to inspire him, and that it had ended up helping fund his drug habit.
 It broke my heart that my Brandon was a drug addict.
 Agenda Item Three: Confront Brandon directly with an intervention.
 The family intervention included me, Bryce, Harry, Anabel, Lisa and even the arresting officer, Denny White, via phone.
 The intervention started with the assumption that Brandon was currently detoxing (for the second time) with us at home, and there were expectations everyone had of him.

Jasmin was standing in the center, and didn't even wait for me to get fully in the room before she started talking.
 "She goes back to Brandon tonight.
 It's a long shot, but it's better than nothing.
 She brought it on herself so there isn't any reason to cry over what might happen."
 Alec shook his head.
 "Unacceptable.
 She wasn't properly his.
 There was no bond of Ja'tell, and consequently we have no obligation to return her to him."
 Jasmin opened her mouth to say something else, but a tiny brunette, probably Jessica, interrupted her.

Half an hour later, I was following him down the hall towards Physics and wishing I'd had more time to prepare.
 Alec slowed as we finally arrived outside the door to Mrs. Alexander's classroom.
 I carefully craned my head around him, half expecting to see Brandon's entire pack waiting to ambush us.
 Instead the pause seemed to have been caused by the fact Mrs. Alexander had been replaced by a sub.
 "Do you mind if we don't go to Physics today?"
 Alec's question should have been lost in the clamor of all of the kids walking by us, but I picked his voice out as easily as if we'd been alone together in the forest.
 Was that another mystical power granted to alpha shape shifters, or just because I was so hyper-aware of him?
 "I thought you said we'd get in trouble if we started cutting school."
 His easy, graceful shrug pulled his black polo shirt tight across his shoulders.

The end of the nuclear arms race between the superpowers may have removed the looming fear of all-out nuclear war and annihilation that surfaced in the artistic drawings of young American school children in the mid-1980s, but the horrible genie of Hiroshima and Nagasaki will continue to haunt us until every nuclear weapon has been destroyed.
 The very existence of the nuclear stock piles carries its own inherent dynamism for their utilization, which is likely to be expressed intentionally or accidentally sooner or later.
 There have been repeated efforts by the non-aligned nations to move a resolution in the UN General Assembly that the use of nuclear weapons should be declared a crime against humanity and outlawed.
 One hundred and twenty-six nations have voted for the resolution.
 It is ironic that the opposition to this resolution and justification for the continued possession and possible use of nuclear weapons come solely from the most militarily, politically and economically powerful group of nations, which are militarily without adversary and at the same time in the best position to afford and institute alternative means for their national security.
 Here lies the real key: the insistence of the few most powerful nations on perceiving security in their own terms, and their insatiable urge to achieve ever more of it for themselves at the expense of greater insecurity for others and the world as a whole, even though their goal can never be achieved on this unilateral basis.
 During the Cold War, nuclear weapons were legitimized by the five permanent members of the Security Council which are the nuclear weapon states.
 Now that it is over, the governments of these nations seek to justify continued possession and the option to use these weapons, even while exerting every possible pressure to stop proliferation to other countries.
 The very logic which the nuclear weapon states rely on to support this policy, however, makes the acquisition of these weapons extremely attractive to non-nuclear powers.
 So long as their possession and possible use is tolerated and justified, the relatively low cost of production and high threat potential of these weapons offer strong incentives for other states to acquire them.

absence of a92m nuclear0m weapon92m threat0m, is the key factor in any decision to use these weapons. The decision to use nuclear weapons is a decision that will be made for a long time. It will be a decision that will be made for92m a0m92m long0m92m time0m. It will be a decision that will be

I mean, why she's the way she is?"
 Definitely not a time for funniness apparently.
 "What do you mean?
 I've only met her the one time.
 She seemed normal enough.
 I guess a little distracted..." The chuckle I'd been waiting for surfaced, but it wasn't at all like his normal laugh.
 It was as if someone had sucked all of the joy and goodness out of the sound I'd grown to crave on a nearly subconscious level, and left a twisted shell.
 "She's definitely distracted.
 You could even say utterly disconnected from the world.
 Completely free from the present, always living in the past."

Mom looked away from the skyline, a new batch of concern painted across her features.
 "I'm so sorry, dear.
 I didn't particularly approve of him, but I wasn't going to get really vocal about it.
 Not when he was your first boyfriend.
 What happened?"
 I didn't have to pretend to be hurt and disappointed.
 Even knowing that Alec was everything I'd thought Brandon was, I still felt used and disappointed.
 "I just wasn't what he was looking for.
 He made it very clear the last time I saw him."

My thanks received only a nod in return, and then Rachel was waving goodbye as they backed down the lane.
 The Jeep was gone, of course.
 I wiped away the beginnings of perspiration as I climbed our steps.
 It was still hot enough outside that I knew it was going to be miserable inside.
 By the time I reached the door I was contemplating just finding a decent tree and spending the afternoon outside.
 The sight of a white envelope, barely visible against the off-white door, was enough to drive those thoughts out of my head.
 It had my name on the side that'd been facing the door.
 I pulled it down as I walked inside the house.
 Mom was gone, there wasn't any reason I couldn't read whatever was in the envelope in the living room, but I found myself quickly climbing up our creaky stairs and closing my bedroom door behind me.
 I tore the envelope open and pulled out a piece of heavy paper, almost like parchment.

She was here, too.
 The water helped.
 I was able to sit up with Chevelle’s assistance.
 Ruby swirled into the room, dressed in a red frock of sorts.
 The color hurt my eyes.
 “Here, a bath will help.
 Come with me, dear.” Her hair was tied halfway back with a scarf, the tattered ends mingling with crimson curls.
 I felt dizzy again.
 She hauled me off the bed, supporting me as I stood.
 She was much smaller than I had thought, slipping easily under my arm.

At first he just yelled at me, and beat mom.
 Then after mom disappeared he turned his full wrath to me.
 I think I was five at the time.
 It was like a week after she didn’t come home, he blamed me for it, I don’t remember much after the first few kicks.
 I think I passed out.
 When I woke up it was days later, I think, hard to be sure.
 He just left me to fend for myself, he didn’t care enough to do anything to help, he just left me lying on the floor.

“These swords were once wielded by Aerland Shen.

 “Long have I waited for someone to wield these blades.
 An elf crafted and used them in battle, an elf cursed into an orc.
 These swords can only be held by one who has the blood of both inside him.” Velixar held the hilts out to Harruq, who drew one from its sheath.
 The sword’s blade was deep black and wreathed in a soft red glow.
 He weaved it through the air, his mouth agape at the ease in which it glided.

Instinct took over and I flung my arms up to block his swing with my own.
 The metal clashed and I felt the shock vibrate through me even as the peal pulsed in my ears.
 He struck again and I pulled the sword back, twisting to block another shot.
 I straightened and raised it back, surprised at how powerful I felt the moment before releasing my blow.
 I smiled as I swung at him, sure he would stop me but reveling in being attacker instead of victim.
 He wound his blade around mine, a metallic screech filling my ears as he knocked my strike aside before coming back at me.
 We continued, blow after blow, the repetitive clank forming a pattern in my head.
 Chevelle seemed to be enjoying himself as the exercise increased in intensity.
 I found I was as well.
 I’d taken no direct beatings like my other training and I wasn’t getting as tired.

Everyone else having somehow gotten too short suddenly wasn't as important.
 The room was still swinging around, only now it wasn't moving, I was.
 A pair of muscular arms encircled my tingling waist and legs, holding me tightly to a near rock-hard chest as Alec deftly weaved through the approaching crowd of students.
 I closed my eyes as a wave of heat started at my collarbones and rushed up to the tips of my ears.
 I wanted to throw up, except that would be even more embarrassing than being carried out of class by the most popular boy in school.
 I opened my eyes and found we were already out in the hall.
 Alec's stride was so smooth it was hard to believe we weren't still back in the classroom.
 "Put me down, I mean please put me down."
 Those clear, deep eyes met mine for a second, seeming to look past the surface and all the way down to the bleeding mental gash that'd just triggered my most recent collapse.
 I was trying to marshal my arguments, but his eyes wiped my mind clean.

She was obviously mad, but once again I couldn't muster enough concern to figure out what'd ticked her off.
 I blinked several times as I realized Mrs. Campbell had been speaking to me for several seconds.
 She was important, one of the few teachers that actually liked me.
 It was incredibly hard, but I focused on what she was saying, voluntarily pulling myself partway out of the wonderful cushion and exposing myself to some of the pain.
 "Are you sure you're okay?"
 My nod and smile must not have been very convincing.
 "Listen, there isn't any real reason to keep the lab open so late today, and you've made amazing progress catching up.
 Why don't you take the night off, and go straight home?"
 The idea didn't make sense.

The orc howled at the sensation of a hundred scorpions stinging his flesh.
 Flooded with adrenaline, he hurled Qurrah aside, desperate to break the contact between them.
 Qurrah’s thin body crumpled against the dirt.
 At the sight of it, Harruq felt his rage break loose.
 He slammed his fist into the orc’s stomach, followed by a brutal kick to the groin.
 Harruq rammed his elbows into the orc’s face, baring his teeth in a feral grin as he felt cartilage crunch.
 Staggering back, the orc dropped one of his swords and clutched his face.
 “His sword,” Qurrah shouted loud as he could.
 “Take it, brother!”
 Harruq obeyed without thought.

People heard I was going to be a father again and asked, "So how old will you be when the baby turns eighteen?"
 or "What if you die?"
 She’s a girl, the doctor said, and I reasoned a girl might be quieter, a little more gentle than a boy.
 Knowing her sex made her more real.
 For the first time, I started getting pictures.
 I saw her as thin, pale skinned and strong like her mom, with reddish hair of a peculiar henna-like tint.
 Her eyes were bright and inquisitive, her mouth ever-ready to speak.
 "Oh Lord," I gasped because my heart was melting.

 “An imp.” “I’d never believed it to be true if I hadn’t seen it myself.” He was lost in thought as he continued, “We may move again.
 The risk seems too great.” Suddenly, I didn’t want them to relocate.
 I wanted them to stay right there, where I could watch them.
 I tried to make him feel safe.
 “You know, I could protect you.” He was incredulous.
 I decided to show him.
 I stepped forward, noting his unease at my movement, and faced the boar that lay on the ground behind him.

Whatever had been there lived a little like the imps.
 And there were imp tracks there, but it appeared only one.
 A massive numbers of bowls and jars littered the camp.
 I have no idea who would need so many.
 The fairies like containers, but not of this crude sort—the craftsmanship was almost that of a troll.
 I tried to stay on the opposite side of the camp from my sister’s wrath, but I found tracks and had to follow them near her, stirring up another fit of rage.
 The prints were shoed, about the size of elves, but the treads were irregular.
 Whatever stayed here, there were a lot of them.
 Near the center of the camp the ground was beat down with tracks, circling a ring of stones.

He reached down and tore a hunk from the spit, tossing it to me with a wink.
 When I blushed, he smiled a wicked smile.
 My mouth went dry.

 Handsome too, I supposed, though I could tell even from these few gestures he was a bit cocky.
 He reminded me of Evelyn, always so proud of herself for finding me out.

 I quit my grocery job and took the money I had saved and headed off to the islands.

 We were on an extended vacation and my best friend Pete, who went with me, was a spoiled brat with an endless supply of money from his father who was one of the Greek associates of my stepfather, Dino.

Whatever it was, it left my skin feeling warmer than usual, and more than a little tight.
 Even after I looked away with a flush of embarrassment, I still felt like I could feel his eyes watching me.
 I could feel his presence behind and to the left of me, like a gentle tingle of electricity I could've pointed to even with my eyes closed.
 I resisted the urge to look back again as the lights dimmed and the orchestra began the opening strains of the first number.
 The actor playing Jean Valjean strode out onto the stage, and even weighed down by chains, he still commanded everyone's attention as though he was a member of the nobility.
 Each successive character somehow managed to latch onto my heart as they arrived.
 Despite the nagging sensation that I could feel Alec behind me, the first few minutes of the play exceeded all my hopes.
 That all changed when they started 'Lovely Ladies'.
 It was my absolute least favorite song on the whole soundtrack.
 Frankly the whole play would've been better if they'd just left it off.

I’d learn and go back… But how?
 How could I learn without a teacher?
 Chevelle.
 The fire died as I thought of the concern he’d shown me in the clearing, the tender moment we’d shared.
 With one word, the flames caught again, burning with a vengeance through the field.
 Watcher.
 None of it had been real.
 He was a watcher, he’d volunteered to watch me, to keep me in line.

What I want to say—the difference is not a drama, the difference is a poem, a song, a way of looking at life, that’s slightly atilt, slightly askew, perhaps, but it’s all me, you know?

Olga Savitsky was a poet.
 We met at a small church charismatic enough so that nobody minded when she stood in the midst of a service and offered her latest poem.
 Long ago, Olga had discovered that what she needed most was God.
 She would hike and pray her way up Cowles Mountain, a mile and a half of rocky trail, then call her best friend Warren so they could pray together, sometimes for hours.
 Then she might go to work, cleaning somebody’s home while listening to worship music.
 God, God, God.
 Here is another of her poems, a simple one I’m choosing because you can also find it on Youtube, read by my Zoë: Jesus, in the night you are my nightlight.
 Jesus, in the morning you are my daylight.
 Jesus, in the afternoon you are my sunlight.
 Jesus, in the evening you are my starlight.

Eagerness, desire.
 Both curbed by the same iron will that'd continued fighting long past where most people would've given up and died.
 I patted the bed next to me, wincing slightly as even that simple motion pulled on things that weren't meant to be pulled on.
 He stared at me for several seconds, and then sat down on the bed.
 I waited, and then when I was sure that was as close as he planned on getting, I slid closer, resting my head on his arm.
 As long as I was careful not to go too far, not to touch too much of him, I could get away with that much.
 His half-imagined sigh sent little trills of satisfaction through me.
 He wasn't going to initiate contact.
 If I didn't know with an absolute certainty that he wanted to be with me, I would've despaired already.
 Still, Dominic had been right so many days ago.

“For if you are safe, then I am not.”
 He crept down the stairs, the whip coiled and ready to burst into flame.
 Before the circular front window stood an elf, one hand on the glass, the other holding a bow.
 Qurrah reached into his pocket, clutching a few pieces of bone.
 Before he could draw them out the elf spoke, his voice soft and sad.
 “Too much death this day,” he said.
 “For hundreds of years my brother and I lived here, and for hundreds of years more we would have remained.
 He is dead now, and for what reason?”
 “Death has no reason,” Qurrah said, his whole body tensing.
 “No,” the elf said, turning around so he could stare at Qurrah eye to eye.

Now, with Brandon having taken an interest in me, I got everything from simple acknowledgment of my presence to obvious dislike, and even a couple of people who looked like they wanted to take Britney's place.
 I suppose some people would have been thrilled by the chance to join the top of the social food chain, but it mostly just disgusted me.
 I politely rebuffed the scavengers, ignored the haters, and carefully acknowledged the rest without giving them anything else to go on.
 It was a rather depressing exercise.
 By the time Mrs. Sorenson had fired a couple of ridiculously obscure questions at me, I found the good feelings I'd managed to carry away from the mayor's visit the night before had pretty much evaporated.
 English should have been better.
 Wuthering Heights wasn't ever going to be my favorite book, but Mr. Whethers had made the characters more real in the last few days and I was actually excited to see what he had in store next.
 Unfortunately, Mr. Whethers wasn't there.
 The substitute teacher sitting at his desk didn't even take roll; he just shut the door, told us to keep it down, and flipped open a magazine.
 While I was sitting at my desk wondering what to do with the next hour of my life, something I'd read in the physics book suddenly clicked.

“Monster!” I cried.
 “You’re a monster!” He didn’t answer me.
 I looked up the hill to see a bunch of faery jerks running down the hill towards us.
 Emily stood in front of Jason and raised her hands.
 I notched an arrow and aimed.
 Dust kicked up everywhere as I aimed blindly.
 I heard one of them shout out in pain.
 I shot another and another, anger burning through me.

 I turned around and saw Seth’s body through the dust.

Something hit the stall next to me, hard enough to leave dents.
 I was scared, I should have been terrified, but I was too busy trying to breathe.
 It was like the air had become thick, and although the fine strands of hair on the back of my neck hadn't moved, it felt like they should be standing on end.
 I heard indistinct sobbing, and then the voice returned and made me shiver.
 The sensation started somewhere on my back, and traveled forward like it was clawing to get out of my face.
 "I know you're sorry, just like you were sorry before.
 Only I don't really believe you, so we're instituting a new policy.
 If I catch you sniffing around him again, I'll kill you.

 My pulse skyrocketed as the raw terror hit.

“This is the door to Igneeria,” the dwarf pronounced proudly.
 I fought the urge to say, “No duh!” Jason looked up, mesmerized.
 “Epic.” “Epic?” Seth scoffed.
 “That’s all you can say?

 The old Seth seemed to be coming back, which was great.
 I was getting really tired of quiet, watching Seth.
 “Then how about ‘the coolest thing on Earth?’” Jason asked.
 Seth shook his head.
 “No, it’s not even a part of Earth.

Liz – Thanks Mr. Trelain, Jim was just telling me what he thought.
 I would appreciate hearing your opinion on what you like and dislike.
 Art – Well, I must say I love that painting of Jesus and Elvis shaking hands, and the one next to it of them fighting the Ninjas.
 It looks so lifelike, and it is extremely unique in concept.
 For the rest, I’m not art-minded enough to tell you anything special.
 Liz – That doesn’t matter, just tell me what appeals to you.

I smiled, thinking how easy it had been as I slid my fingertips across the volumes on that shelf.
 My fingers tingled as they crossed a thin section of pages bound together.
 I slid them out just as I became aware of some sort of commotion… that sounded like it was getting closer.
 No, not a tingle indicating what I was looking for.
 It was a protection spell.
 I ran.
 As I shot through the rooms, all I could think of was not getting caught.
 I shoved the pages under my shirt before I made it through the last door.
 The village was crowded with elves, oblivious to my horror.
 The protection spell must have only alerted council.

Now was the time to strike.
 "Mom, go call Mr. Peters, and I'll start pulling your stuff together."
 It's amazing how quickly you can pack when it's for someone else, and they aren't around to tell you what you can or can't throw into their suitcase.
 Even with my lack of sleep starting to catch up with me, I was still essentially done by the time Mom wandered into her room, staring at her phone like she wasn't sure it was really possible for it to have just told her what she'd just heard.
 "He says it's fine.
 He'll swing by next week to pick up the shots I think are the most promising, and then he'll see if he can't put the brochure together from that."
 She noticed the suitcases and the empty hangers for the first time.
 "Honey, there isn't any reason to be in such a hurry.
 We haven't really decided to take the job yet, and even if we do, I'm sure we won't be able to arrange a flight for another day or two."

 She smiled, but all at once her smile dissolved into an uncomfortable blush.

But nothing happened.
 I sat up, holding both hands in front of me, palms up, as I focused on lighting a flame, any flame.

 I reached out to move a rock from the floor.

 It didn’t shift in the least.

Rachel's eyes lit up brighter than I'd seen them in a while.
 "You're welcome.
 Does that mean we can go to Vegas?"
 It seemed like a crime to deny her, but I knew Mom didn't have the spare money to send me on a two-hour trip to an opera.
 I was working now, but by the time I could save up enough to pay for gas, food, and a ticket, the production would've moved on.
 "I'm sorry, I'd like to go, but I just don't think I can.
 If it was running for an extra month or two I could probably save up enough money from tutoring, but it isn't, so it just isn't going to happen."
 Rachel nodded, and for a second it was easy to forget that she probably got more spending money each month than I'd see all year.

My hands hurt, only when I looked down to see why, it was because my fingernails were digging into my palms.
 The blood was pounding so furiously in my ears that I couldn't hear the next name read.
 I could tell it wasn't mine though because nobody turned back to congratulate me.
 There was only one name left to be read, and I knew that it wasn't going to be mine.
 I'd never been that lucky in my entire life.
 As quickly as that my pulse slowed and my fists relaxed.
 I could clearly hear as Principal Gossil cleared his throat and continued.
 "The fifth winner is Ms. Adriana Paige."
 The cheer from my classmates wasn't nearly as loud as the one for Pam, but it didn't matter.

But as the afternoon wrapped up his final match was against Karun who had two second place white ribbons on her arm.
 Rodregas was pretty sure this match would decide who got the yellow first place ribbon and who would get the white.
 If Rodregas won it would give him ten total points after three competitions.
 It would give Karun twelve points if she once more came in second.
 If he lost, it would be much harder.
 Karun would have thirteen and he would have nine points.

Again, Qurrah lusted for such power and control.
 Velixar smiled, clearly seeing the desire the half-orc hid behind his eyes.
 “One day you will hold such control.
 For now, be content with what I have taught you.”
 Qurrah gave a soft laugh and then nodded.
 “I believe that shall suffice.”
 Harruq did not know why, but the short exchange sent chills running to the pit of his stomach.

 “Thank you,” Harruq said, grateful even though his insides churned.
 He had faced many men in battle, and yet here he was, his heart skipping beats at the thought of meeting this mysterious Aurelia.
 What was wrong with him?
 “You are welcome, half-orc,” the elf said before moving on, the bow still hung comfortably on his back.
 Harruq watched him go, staring longer than he felt he should.
 He couldn’t shake the feeling he was being led into a trap.
 “So be it,” he said.
 He would not be afraid of meeting an elf in battle.

“Karak!” he shouted, all his power fleeing him.
 His undead minions collapsed, their souls released.
 The gates to the abyss opened before his eyes, and he felt the pull on his soul.
 The dark fire already burned.
 He saw the face of his master, and the sick grin there horrified him.
 “I will not die!” he shrieked.
 “I will not die!”
 His flesh burned in fire, his bones blew away as dust on the wind, and only an empty robe remained of the being that was Velixar.
 Yet, still haunting the wind, was his final cry, a promise to the world of Dezrel.

The rug that covered the entire house made it impossible to detect his footsteps, but after several seconds she felt secure enough to undress.
 It wasn't that she didn't trust him; she just felt ill at ease disrobing with a man she wasn't related to just inches away.
 She took off her dress and laid it carefully over the commode.
 Then she removed the binding that kept the straight line of her dress from being spoiled.
 She should wash all her underclothes, since they were the only ones she had.
 But where would she hang them?
 Surely there was a place in the bedroom.
 She turned off the faucet and stepped into the warm water.

They would push anyone falling out back into the squares.
 Watchers were not allowed around the squares.
 Rodregas knew Imeralda and Doi’van were atop the wall, the closest spot allowed for spectators.
 Two contestants had already fought.
 The rules were simple.
 Two went in and one came out walking.
 The constants were bare of chest and foot.
 There were no fancy speeches to start the match, a bell sounded and the next round began.

One or more profit-making commercial organizations should be established as a public sector joint venture of developing countries to promote the commercial transfer of technology to, within and between developing countries and to channel the profits from this activity toward research in these countries.
 9.Global employment model: Our efforts to promote employment are constrained by a lack of detailed knowledge of how global labour markets actually work.
 We still do not understand the impact of technology, trade, macro-economic policies, multinational corporations, shifting patterns of foreign investment and many other factors on job creation, and our ignorance severely hampers effective policy formulation and coordination.
 An international research programme should be organized under the ILO to construct a truly global employment model that monitors the impact of technological developments, expanding world trade, plant closings, movement of industry to low-wage countries, agriculture-led industrialization, economic growth, immigration policies, refugee movements and other factors affecting employment opportunities around the world.
 10.Shift focus of technological development: The number of jobs created or destroyed by technology depends on the priority given to various objectives in the process of technological development.
 Presently, there is an in-built bias in technological R & D towards replacing human labour with capital and energy, even when similar levels of quality and efficiency could be achieved by alternative means.
 A conscious shift of focus could lead to the development of more labour-intensive production processes.
 The production of more food to meet the needs of a burgeoning population has been one of the outstanding global achievements of the post-war period.

I tried to distract myself as we rode east around the lake, attempting to name the species of plants as Junnie might have made me, but there were so many I had never seen that it started to remind me of the difference rather than distract me from it.
 So I bantered with Steed regarding horses and imps and everything I could come up with to keep him talking.
 Chevelle rode quietly behind us, scanning our surroundings.
 I wasn’t sure if he was enjoying the scenery or playing lookout.
 We rode a few days into the base of the mountains.
 We had stopped to camp when, over dinner, Steed announced he would be leaving us the next morning, heading east.
 His easy humor had become a comfort to me during the long days, our quiet evenings a pattern I knew I would miss.
 The disappointment must have shown on my face.
 He reached a hand up and brushed my hair behind an ear.
 “Don’t worry, sunshine, I will see you again.” I smiled a little and he winked at me.

And the emotion that permeated his jumbled thoughts was guilt.
 He'd been preoccupied with thoughts of Marie ever since he'd seen her picture.
 Was it possible that his thoughts had somehow brought her here?
 But even if that were true, how could he have known that thinking about someone would cause her to appear?
 He'd loved studying history in school, and Abraham Lincoln had never appeared.
 He scowled at the chicken as he took it from the oven.
 How was he going to help her get back?
 He didn't have much faith-- Marie's scream almost made him drop the chicken.
 Depositing the pan on the stove, he ran to the living room.
 She was sitting up, gasping for breath, a look of terror on her face.

Much of the shift from labour to capital might not be economically justified were it not for the in-built bias in this system.
 Low levels of taxation on the depletion of non-renewable energy resources in the United States is another distorting influence that makes machine-driven activity more cost-effective than it would otherwise be.
 5.Analyse job impact of government policies: Almost every government policy has a direct or indirect impact on employment.
 Often the relationship is not recognized or intended.
 An analysis of the impact of major public policies on employment at the local, state and nation level can result in avoidance or removal of significant legislative and administrative roadblocks to job growth.
 Require employment assessment of new policy initiatives prior to adoption.
 6.Re-orient social security programmes toward re-employment: OECD countries spend 2-3 per cent of GDP on labour market policies, most of it to support the unemployed.
 The United Kingdom spends nearly $14,000 a year on every unemployed person.
 The United States spends three times as much on welfare payments as it does on retraining the unemployed.
 For three decades, Sweden achieved the highest employment rate among OECD countries based on 'the passionate belief in full employment' and 'the right to work' and on active policies to generate work for all, rather than payments to the unemployed.

There was probably money in the purser’s office, but he knew that the door, as well as the room was rigged with poison needles and other traps, both mundane and magical.
 Rodregas had the impression that Ravenhurr had spent most of his wealth of late on the Dire Cats.
 After Rodregas’ recent generosity, he did not want to take the risk of dying for a nearly empty treasure box.
 He looked out of the entrance, over to the gate and up to the top of the wall where a small tower provided cover.
 There, one of the few guards left should be watching the front gate.
 Also kept in the tower were two of the nicest weapons Rodregas had ever seen: a pair of recurve bows of Wood Nymph created black yew.
 There was no way they would have been taken.
 There were standing orders to kill anyone who tried to remove them.
 Rodregas was not a very good bowman, but he was definitely going to try to bring them with him.
 He peeked out of the main doors and looked around the open keep.

“Is going to a different world supposed to be vacation-relaxing-in-the-sun easy?” He smirked, “I never said that.” “You implied it,” I said, with a roll of my eyes.
 He sighed and pushed me into the doorway, the dark, swirling mist swallowing me up.
 I felt his hands leave my back for a second and then they were back.
 The chilly feeling welcomed me, like a long lost friend.
 As soon as the mist cleared, I was standing in a forest clearing.
 The sky was hazy and dreary, making me want to run back to Earth.
 But when I turned around, the door was gone.
 Emily looked terrified, her eyes bigger than the eerie moon above.
 Jason was frozen next to her, eyes darting around at the shadows.

 Qurrah nodded, his thoughts distant.

The last thing I wanted was for Thomas to be a part of this.
 Oh, how he would rub my face in this shit.
 You would think with all my experience around drugs that I would have known what to do.
 That is exactly what I thought!
 Brandon was sickly and skinny.
 My wife lay with him for hours rubbing his back and keeping fluids in him.
 He went from cold to hot and back again.
 In a couple of weeks he was looking much healthier and we sent him out into the world again.
 Turns out, just because I did drugs and knew people who were addicted to drugs I was still not qualified to understand how to break someone from craving the drugs that satisfy their addiction.
 Brandon seemed better and we thought we had helped him simply because we incarcerated him at home away from his peers until he had the drugs out of his system.

The sprained ankle had slowed me down enough that there was no way I was going to make it back to my locker before the bell rang.
 Still, I tried to be gracious when it went off just as I handed Mrs. North the papers.
 Based on the number of classrooms on the second floor, and the narrowness of the stairs, there was no point in trying to wait the crowd out.
 I gritted my teeth and limped out into the surge of bodies.
 Surprisingly enough, there were more familiar faces than expected.
 As I grabbed the handrail on the right, I noticed Isaac several feet ahead of me.
 Of course, it's hard to miss someone nearly six feet tall and almost as well-muscled as Alec.
 Even if he was partially hidden by Vincent, who was strutting along a little higher up the stairs with all of his usual arrogance.
 If Isaac had been the one close enough to reach out and touch, I probably would've tried to get his attention and said hi.
 With Vincent, I just stayed quiet and hoped he wouldn't notice me.

The memories should have made me feel better, but they had the opposite effect.
 I felt the tears start again as I realized all that goodness and joy was gone from my life forever.
 As my immunity started to wear off, I gratefully surrendered to the next attack, and the blissful relief it represented.
 I knew I was on track to drop back into the funk that'd robbed me of the weeks immediately after they died, but I was still strangely numb in the parts that should have cared.
 It seemed like I was on my third iteration, but it might have been the fourth or fifth.
 I was too detached to care.
 The knock on the door at least brought me back to myself enough to wonder how long I'd been on the floor.
 My ankle hurt so bad, it was all I could do to get myself standing and then hobble the fifteen feet to the door.
 When I finally managed to get the door open and found empty space where there should have been a person, I almost swore.
 Then I saw the incredibly beautiful rose on our porch.

 "Yes, I understand.
 But--" "No.

It was sad, but I didn't trust her anymore, so I'd probably take the bus if she didn't show up before it did.
 I just couldn't risk her leaving me here without a ride.
 She'd been way weirded out after my collapse.
 I wasn't sure even the promise of Brandon's continued presence would be enough to convince her to come through on her word.
 I hurried downstairs and grabbed my liquid lunch replacement out of the fridge.
 I was in such a hurry I almost didn't see the new note on the white board.
 Sorry I missed you last night.

I walked over and tried to help her.
 “Why do you think Seth won’t tell us what he was doing?” I asked, watching her because she had refused to let me help.

The stranger watched me as I ate.
 When I devoured the first piece, he laughed and threw me another.
 I hoped I looked appropriately abashed.
 As I finished the second serving, he stepped closer to sit on the misshapen rock that rose through the earth beside me.
 He held his hand wide and a canteen flew up from a pile of things on the other side of the fire.
 He passed it to me, and I tilted it back, expecting cool water.
 I almost choked when warm wine hit my throat.
 He leaned forward to get a better look at me as I lowered the container.
 He looked as if he thought I might spook, otherwise I guessed he had plenty to say hidden beneath that smirk.
 It didn’t stop him from moving uncomfortably close, though, or eyeing me with what I was certain was the same look I’d just given my meal.

Well, she'd have to put on her thinnest cotton dress.
 She'd like to just keep Rick's t-shirt on.
 No, she thought, stripping it off.
 She didn't want to get her own perspiration on it.
 She shouldn't wear it.
 She should get a big doll or stuffed animal and put the shirt on it.
 Then she could sleep with it in her arms.
 The evening out with her family was wonderful, but when she awoke the next morning, it was with the same confused mixture of happiness and panic that she'd felt when she'd thought about leaving Rick and coming home.
 Her breathing shallow, she sat up and tried to calm herself.

It was a huge grass circle with a small play set in the middle covered in kids.
 The woods surrounded it except for the side that faced the street.

 Emily was fumbling with her bike lock, which was old and rusted and usually refused to work without a fight.

 Words
 A single word can change our lives.
 Some years ago, I began to think hard about the word "love" as in "God is love" and in a challenge Sylvia Curtis made.
 Sylvia was an invalid, and rather crazy, given to dark moods and paranoid notions.
 She was the mother of my best friend Eric.
 I had come to help with chores and listen to her rant about whatever injustices she had recently suffered.
 Her apartment was dingy and cluttered, mostly with books.

 “Not good enough,” he said.
 Wild anger contorted his face.
 Black lightning thicker than a man’s arm tore down the street.
 Aurelia gasped as all her power flowed into her shield.
 The collision sent her flying, her magical barrier shattered into nothingness.
 The lightning continued, swirling about her body.
 Every nerve in her body shrieked with pain.
 She landed hard, unable to brace for the fall.
 The air blasted out of her lungs, and for one agonizing second they refused to draw in another breath.

I tried to inject the proper amount of blonde stupidity into my words, but wasn't sure it worked until I felt Alec's arms tighten almost painfully around me.
 I gasped, and he set me down so quickly I almost fell over.
 Before I'd even regained my balance, he was walking away, moving so quickly I would've needed to run to keep up.
 Even so, he hadn't turned away quick enough to hide the complete disdain in his expression.
 I suddenly found myself wishing I'd told him the truth rather than making him think I was stupid and manipulative.
 It was too late.
 He was already out of sight, and by now his opinion of me was fixed.
 Chapter 4 School hadn't gotten any worse after I'd convinced the hottest boy on the planet that I was a complete waste of oxygen, but it hadn't gotten any better either.
 Mrs. Tiggs, my Spanish teacher, had seemed every bit as mean as my Biology teacher from earlier in the day, and it had been a relief when Britney had finally dropped me off at home.
 I watched Britney's little white Saturn disappear down the lane with a complex set of feelings that included a bit of loneliness and more than a little relief.

"My scars aren't readily visible, but they're there.
 That's why Alec is forced to come move the food he has sent to me.
 The scar tissue built up around my heart tends to pull in painful ways when my pulse starts racing.
 I tend not to worry about it all that much, but Alec fears it's a sign of deeper problems.
 I generally humor him and leave the heavy lifting for his visits, and we both pretend he doesn't know about the small garden I keep in a nearby cave."
 I opened my mouth, but just simply didn't know what to say.
 The horror of being trapped in a body that was riddled with old injuries was something thousands of people faced every day, but it seemed even more of a shame for someone who'd once been so vital and strong.
 Mallory's smile held only the faintest hint of regret.

He opened up the fireplace and started to chuck all the evil books into the fire with the poker.
 The ones from which magic radiated he placed into the trunk; true books of magic would sell nicely.
 The process of sorting the books and then getting them to burn took several hours and he started to feel how long it had been since his new body had slept.
 The sound of the tower was changing, the first sounds of the kitchen crew getting ready for the morning.
 Still he kept at it, though there seemed to be nothing else of wealth in the room.
 He was determined to see the evil books burn.
 They held the secrets to the Immortalist art and other dark magic.
 Leaving them would only lead to another person rising in Ravenhurr’s place.
 Several of the foulest books seemed to refuse to burn but the flames eventually consumed all, just as they had consumed Ravenhurr.
 Finally, the last of the dark books of magic were burned, and the few remaining books that felt of magic but lacked the evil stench of the others were packed in the trunk.

 He was then supposed to tell Steve that he needed help supplying one of his regulars while his parents were holding him with a tight leash and ask him if he could do it.
 All Brandon was asking for in return for this connection was a few Oxy pills dropped at our house as a referral fee.
 Brandon asked Steve to just put the pills on his windowsill so he could get high unbeknownst to his parents.
 The intention was to make Steve believe that Brandon was still using, and thus trustworthy.
 Brandon was a nervous wreck.
 He was completely confused after days of detox and scared to death that he was going to prison if the scheme failed.
 Brandon contacted the other drug dealer from his own cell phone so Steve would recognize the number.
 Brandon told Steve the concocted story and then supplied Steve with the phone number that Officer White had given him for the phony buyer.

It must be as strange for him as it was for her--a woman from the past had walked into his garden.
 He didn't believe in such things any more than she did, but he'd done his best to help her get back.
 And he'd been so kind and considerate, introducing her to the marvels of his time, seeing to her comfort, holding her when she was frightened .
 .
 .
 He really was very handsome, she mused, sinking deeper into the water.
 She'd been too preoccupied to really think much about it, but now she reflected on his lovely blue eyes, his perfect features, his smile.
 And he was so kind.
 Her own betrothed fled at even a hint of tears, but Rick had held her and stroked her hair.
 That was a highly improper action, of course, but then, this was a situation for which no etiquette had ever been designed.

﻿Gardner Remembers: The Lost Tapes an interview with Creole Myers (PLUS: Memphis musicologist, Linda Israel’s mini-biography of the man, “The Growth and Death of Buddy Gardner” Corey Mesler
 Copyright © 2011 by Corey Mesler Pocketful of Scoundrel/SmashWords Edition www.pocketofscoundrel.wordpress.com www.kuboapress.wordpress.com

 The Growth and Death of Buddy Gardner by Dana Illsire © 1975
 You know Buddy “Slipshod” Gardner from his later solo work, the early seventies stuff when he latched onto the singer/songwriter craze begun probably by Sweet Baby James.
 You know him for his albums “Rain and Other Distractions” or “I Was a Child When Smaller.”  But this is the story of headier days, days when the Overton Park Shell was a magical place, the later rainbow implied.
 When Buddy played lead guitar and sang for Black Lung, a blues rock band with a loyal Memphis following.

Dad had the business to keep him occupied.
 Johnny – Yeah I know, he spent fifty or sixty hours a week there after mom left.
 I didn’t ever see him.
 A lot of help he was.
 Jim – Some times all we need is just to escape.
 Look at me, I read Sumo Assassin.
 It helps me forget this world for at least some time.
 It isn’t even a good comic, but it beats thinking about life from time to time.

“Gaelwren waited for your departure.
 He will not find it difficult killing a wounded dog.”
 The anger inside Harruq consumed him entirely.
 He charged the elf, abandoning any hint of precaution.
 He slammed his blades down with all his might.
 The elf blocked once, twice, then three times, wincing each time he did.
 Then the other elf was behind Harruq, stabbing at his back.
 While mad with rage, Harruq still knew very well where his opponents were.
 He spun, avoiding the thrust, and then trapped his assailant’s arm with his elbow.
 A flex of his muscles cracked bone, and the sword fell from a limp hand.

“As you wish,” Velixar said, giving a low, mocking bow.

 One sword came from above, aiming for her shoulder, while the other thrust low.

The door was open a crack and I could see Chevelle sitting in the front room.
 I was hesitant to face him.
 I lay there, running back through the events of the night, the stories.
 Embarrassment flooded me again and I turned my head to bury it in the blankets, but something strange on the side table caught my attention.
 I picked it up to examine.
 A small bird, carved of stone.
 A hawk.
 Of onyx.
 I knew at once it was what Chevelle had been working on, carving.
 And then I recognized the stone, the large black stone that had pummeled my face for days, and I couldn’t help but snicker.

A month later he'd read of her engagement to another man.
 He'd actually proposed to Kim, but once she had the ring, all she'd wanted to talk about was what pieces she was going to buy to refurnish the house and at which resorts they were going to spend their summers and how much of his money was in the bank and how much in land investments.
 He'd broken up with her six weeks after proposing.
 He'd never gotten the ring back, of course.
 He was lonely.
 Rick sighed, setting down the carton of fried rice and leaning back.
 That was why he’d been foolish enough to ask Kim to marry him, he now realized.
 He was much more cautious now.
 In fact, Ted said he’d gone to the opposite extreme.
 But he’d finally realized that there were worse things than being lonely.

Go ahead and walk around looking for students who need help.
 Most everyone will leave in the next ten minutes or so, but we're actually open for another hour."
 She was right.
 Nearly everyone left over the next little while as they either finished up their assignments, gave up, or finally filled whatever quota of study time they'd been given by their parents.
 I did get to answer a couple of questions, which was surprisingly fun.
 When there was only half an hour left Mrs. Campbell walked over.
 "Good job so far.
 Albert, the other tutors, and I are all going to head out.
 Stay here until closing time, and then you're free to go.
 We'll see you tomorrow."

Your studies are coming along nicely, and I've heard quite a few good things about you from other sources, so I'd like to offer you a job."
 Now that I had a chance to talk, I wasn't sure what to say.
 Nobody had ever wanted to hire me.
 Mrs. Campbell gave me a tired smile.
 "The tutor lab is still understaffed.
 Obviously you couldn't spend your whole afternoon tutoring, as that would negatively affect your efforts to catch up.
 I'm thinking just an hour or so per night.
 It would just be minimum wage, but I think you'll find you quite enjoy teaching."
 Still at a loss for words, I just nodded.
 I started towards the door as soon as I was dismissed, but stopped at the threshold.

How dare you?” Then he said a single word and from his mouth poured a huge wind, Doi’van flayed around trying to hold on to Van’dret, but he lost his grip and hit the ceiling hard.
 Rodregas crunched the fingers he was holding and heard them snap, even as he was being pushed away.
 With the snapping of the fingers the wind stopped.
 Rodregas then dropped the hand, grabbed Van’dret’s head and twisted.
 He remembered that day in Raven Tower when he had snapped Korin’s neck and his arms bunched up, his muscles rippling with the strain.
 Van’dret was an Immortalist.
 His neck did not snap easily, but it snapped.
 Rodregas did not stop snapping it until he had the man’s face looking into the rock below.
 The three sat there for a minute and then stepped away to rest against the far wall to get some distance from Van’dret’s body.
 After a few minutes Doi’van said, “Well, one more Immortalist down, that’s good.” The other two nodded.

That and, well, you’re a…‌you know…”
 “What?”
 Harruq grew redder.
 “An elf!”
 “What’s wrong with that?”
 Harruq viciously plucked blades of grass.
 “I don’t know.”
 Aurelia stared at Harruq for a while, her eyes probing.
 The half-orc endured the gaze, concentrating fully on his grass-removing project.
 “I would feel better having met your brother,” she said at last.

“What was that for?”
 “Hitting you is my reward for doing well,” she said.
 “Consider it my way of making sure you don’t go easy on me.
 So are you ready to begin?”
 Harruq mumbled something obscene.
 He nodded, swinging in a low chop.
 As his sword struck her staff, the sparring began.
 Aurelia was familiar with her staff, the wood comfortable in her grip.
 She had no sense of tactic, though, and all it took was a quick feint or two before she left herself horribly open.
 Harruq used only one sword, running it in slow circles, stabs, and the occasional feint.

Just wept.
 And I did, too.
 And I sang it again.
 It was just heart wrenching, man, I mean, we were just like two kids given a new lease on life.
 I wrote a song, I kept, thinking.
 I wrote a damn good song.
 I was back, you know, back, but different.
 Different but the same.
 This is what I want everyone to understand.
 What I want to say—the difference is not a drama, the difference is a poem, a song, a way of looking at life, that’s slightly atilt, slightly askew, perhaps, but it’s all me, you know?

Only I hadn't ever felt the underlying hint of power and energy from her that I'd come to associate with Alec and the others.
 "Wait, you're not a shape shifter?
 How is that possible?"
 Rachel's expression as she tried to understand my question was so surprised it actually managed to lighten the mood.
 "Oh, I forget sometimes how much you don't know.
 I'm normal, and Mom's normal, but everyone else is a shape shifter.
 Human-shape shifter marriages almost never happen, but when they do the kids can go either way.
 Alec became a shape shifter, and I'm just a run-of-the-mill girl without even a single superpower."
 We sat in silence for several seconds as I tried to process how that new piece of information fit in with everything else I already knew.
 The obvious, if somewhat selfish, implication was that maybe it really was possible for someone like Alec to want to be with someone like me.

In fact there was not so much as a flicker of light.
 Rodregas lacked the discipline to channel the power.
 Van’dret’s senses were acute on things arcane and he felt the coming flood of power as if it was a real physical thing.
 Van’dret spread his hands and made a frantic move that sent a corona of power around him.
 Of course no focused magic came near him, and what did occur startled even Rodregas.
 Imeralda was literally flying through the air and she had her dagger drawn.
 She did not land smoothly, colliding into Van’dret’s lower body, but she instantly straightened and thrust her dagger into Van’dret’s stomach.
 The dagger did not sink far; a few inches.
 Rodregas expected Van’dret to get his hands up and fend her off, but he seemed to be in shock.
 Imeralda pulled the dagger out and then viscously stuck it back in the sorcerer, her body moved with the stroke, clearly using every ounce of strength she had.

There was a ripping sound, and when I looked down at his hands, they'd been replaced by the same wickedly-sharp claws I remembered from the night before.
 I must have let out a gasp, because Rachel tightened her grasp on me and moved closer.
 She might have whispered something comforting, but I couldn't hear it past the thunder of my own heartbeat.
 All three of them were moving towards us now.
 It was so inhumanly smooth and slow the motion was almost imperceptible, but I was certain they were stalking us.
 Stalking me.
 As soon as they got close enough to cover the remaining distance in a single bound, they'd attack, and if Alec had been sorely pressed fighting two of his kind last night, three were almost certain to kill him.
 Rachel pulled me around behind her and spoke with a calm that seemed too concrete to be real.
 "Jasmin, please don't do this.
 I'm not going to move.

Velixar showed no sign of being aware of their approach.
 His eyes had rolled back into his head as he controlled the multitude of magical hands.
 “Be gone,” Qurrah said, firing several pieces of bone.
 All pieces missed.
 He tried to cast another hemorrhage spell but the words felt heavy and drunk on his tongue.
 His mind ached, his chest heaved, and when the spell finished it created nothing but a wound the size of an arrowhead in the side of Sonowin.
 “Master, defend yourself!” Qurrah shouted as loud as he could.
 Still nothing.
 More and more hands curled in, surrounding Dieredon and Sonowin in a magical maelstrom, yet still they came.

The chamber was large with a tall vaulted ceiling like some temple, but no rows of seats or prayer mats did this temple hold.
 Instead it was filled with beasts; lions and wolves and the great mythical animals of the Celestial Realm.
 Most of these he recognized as the great totems of the Celestial Realm, each representing great power.
 The great beasts were full-size and, but for their lack of movement, Rodregas would have thought that they must have traveled to the Celestial Realm itself.
 “Oh, my Gods, they look real.
 I thought they would be made of stone like the frog,” said Imeralda.
 Rodregas nodded.
 The beasts looked to be made of flesh and bone, except they all stood perfectly still on short stone pedestals.
 Strangely, the room did not smell of damp stone like the rest of the cathedral, but the air smelled of the outdoors in spring.
 Rodregas’ eyes were drawn to the powerful lion that reared up not far into the gathered animals, and just to the right of the center.

That conversation left a bad taste in Rick's mouth, and he arrived at Ted and Lauri's that evening feeling wary.
 "Hi--I'm glad you said to dress casually," Rick greeted Ted, shrugging out of his coat.

 "Sharon insisted.
 She said set-ups are awkward enough without all the formality."
 He hung Rick's coat in the closet.

The distant sound of water trickling down a rock face, of leaves gently caressing each other in the breeze faded away as I took in an amazing wonderland of light.
 The trees I'd been listening to were exactly where I expected them to be, but it took me several heartbeats to recognize them.
 Gone were the sturdy, brown behemoths I'd spent so much time climbing with Cindi.
 Instead, pillars of soft light reached up to the sky, swaying slowly back and forth with the wind, creaking in a rhythm I'd known by heart since I was seven.
 I felt tears collecting in the corners of my eyes as I reached out and touched the nearest tree.
 It was as if the world I'd known my entire life had been simply a moldy cover designed to hide the true nature of my surroundings.
 Now the mask was gone and I was immersed in vivid colors, living lights, and a sense of harmony so strong it nearly overwhelmed me.
 It was impossible to say for certain how long I sat looking at the gentle motion of the tree branches, marveling at the way things made up of light could still cast shadows when silhouetted by the harsher light of the sun.
 Only somehow the sun had disappeared, replaced by the paler, colder light of the moon.
 The trees were still graceful strands of light, but the breeze had changed to a harsh thing, one carrying new scents that somehow represented danger.

 Mrs. Campbell didn't seem like the kind of teacher you could get away with ignoring, so I retrieved an algebra book from the back of the room and sat at my desk.

 Um, when did you get your first real guitar?
 BG:  	That was—oh, when I was eleven, I think.
 I had played around on an old box guitar Dad brought home—I think it was a gift from Mr. Delisi actually.
 We had to sort of sneak it into the house (laughs) but it was old and didn’t sound very good, though I had fun trying to pick out Carter Family or Pete Seeger songs on it.
 Or blues chords.
 And, of course, I had a Mel Bay instructional book.

 Power, in the end, is just another word, too, but the power is gonna belong to someone, so, in the end, who decides?
 Who decides Nixon has more power than Mao, or John Lennon has more power than Roy Cohn?

Her family had all received the calling “to serve elfkind.” I didn’t know exactly what that meant, only that the elf usually left with fanfare and seldom returned in fewer than a hundred years.
 It was apparently a very honorable thing, though she never seemed proud.
 Just off the living area was the study, larger than the front room, stuffed full of documents and lit by a pair of dim oil lanterns.
 Dust covered the decrepit scrolls and books lining the walls, but aside from a well-used worktable, the room was clean.
 Settling onto my usual stool, I leaned forward, elbows on the carved edge of the table to prop my head up for the monotonous hours to come.
 It was hard to say how long I sat so, looking down on a huge volume entitled The Great Elves of Varkenshire, pretending to read.
 But my eyes had wandered from the page to a small thistle where it rested among some other potion ingredients.
 It had begun to extend its leaves.
 I was startled; Junnie was preoccupied with a lengthy scroll across the room and couldn’t have possibly been the source, and I had never made anything grow.

It was probably on its second generation of students, but looked pretty good still.
 The linoleum floor was faded, but still relatively clean, and the white paint on the walls was conspicuously free of tags and gang signs.
 The students even seemed to be mingling fairly easily with each other.
 I actually kind of missed the feel of armed camps.
 My school hadn't been bad compared to some stories I'd heard from California, but there'd still been some kids beaten pretty severely for crossing the wrong group of wannabe gang members.
 Britney had a piece of pizza, and looked like she was eyeing a piece of cake until she noticed I was trailing along behind her without a tray of my own.
 She actually sighed as she passed the cake.
 The urge to giggle was so strong I uncapped my water bottle and turned slightly to the side in an attempt to disguise my amusement.
 It was one of those moments I'd try to reconstruct in my head again and again.
 I think I must have heard the cash register till close, or maybe Britney said something.

The stereo clicked over to another song as we flipped around and headed back into town.
 It was more of the thrumming beats I'd come to associate with Brandon.
 "I thought this place was in one of the parks or something.
 Why are we headed back to town?"
 "Wow, you really are a city girl.
 In order to get far enough not to be busted by the cops we have to go really remote.
 There isn't any way my car would make it where we need to go.
 We're headed to Vincent's to hitch a ride in his truck."
 'Truck' turned out to be an understatement.

She'd loved the pizza they'd had last night.

 She'd found it both delicious and fun to eat.

I was afraid that it would see me.
 Then I got a glimpse of what it had killed and I had to hold back my tears.
 The poor body of the dwarf who had brought us here was lying in a contorted heap, limbs twisted in all directions.
 The scene was awful and I had to prevent myself from throwing up.
 Then I knew why they beat and killed him.
 All the other dwarves were on Kojas.
 This dwarf must have betrayed Kojas to bring information to whoever “her majesty” was and to help us into Igneeria.
 I suddenly knew that this dwarf was much braver than we had given him credit for.
 I suddenly felt awful because I knew who the thing was.

I could not drown the desire to breathe.
 I pushed through the water, gasping and cold, struggling to climb from the muck as I stood and walked out.
 I was drenched, the material of the long gown soaked and heavy and more uncomfortable than ever.
 I loosened the wet corset ties and dropped the dress into a pile at my feet, shivering as I stepped free of it and onto a rock.
 I grabbed a shirt from the pile, and then the slim pants, aware of how nice the fabric felt, how good the cut.
 A leather vest laced over the top.
 It seemed they were tailored for me.
 I’d never had such luck making my own clothes.
 These were trim and fit, made for traveling.
 Not that I knew where I was going.

Brandon told Steve the concocted story and then supplied Steve with the phone number that Officer White had given him for the phony buyer.
 Immediately there was trouble: The officer had accidentally given Brandon the same phone number that Steve already possessed; the same number that had been given to Steve by the same officers for his use when he was setting up a bust of his own.
 Brandon was outed big time.
 Our son was immediately labeled a snitch on the street and had no chance of helping the police.
 Our phone began ringing with crank calls and threats on his life and ours.
 The officers were apologetic; it was apparently an honest mistake.
 Since our son couldn’t see the deal through, he would be charged with the three felonies.
 Brandon was facing five years in prison.
 I was pissed off that the cops fucked this up!
 It was the one chance for my firstborn son to avoid prison, and damn-it there had to be another way.

What sort of weapon did you have in mind?” Her smile widened.
 Her hand stretched out to the side and a long, silver sword came from the pile of gear to land in her palm.
 She righted it, twisting the blade for me to see.
 My stomach dropped.
 “There are a few things you need to remember when using a blade,” she instructed.
 “First of all, always go for the fatal attack.
 If you merely wound someone, well, someone with magic will use the last of their power to stop you.
 Cut off their head or puncture the lung and heart.
 Never mess around.” I imagined myself decapitating someone.

When he opened his eyes, Aurelia stood, shocked by the red light wafting like smoke from Harruq’s eyes.

 The words stung him.
 His vision swam crimson.

 Perhaps he should have left her bleeding upon the ground to die alone and…

I heard them, but my mind refused to assign meanings to the sounds.
 It wasn't until he'd moved his arm and rolled out of bed with his characteristic speed and grace that I finally realized he meant to take me to the Lilac Room and then return here to sleep.
 I suddenly had a hard time breathing.
 The idea of lying alone in the dark, in the very room I'd just seen Brandon demolish, sent my heart into an erratic rhythm.
 If there'd been an EMT present they'd have already been charging up the defibrillator.
 Alec turned around while I was still trying to get my throat to work again.
 "You stopped breathing.
 What's wrong?"
 The tears his touch had dried up a few seconds before were back, and just seconds away from escaping the corners of my eyes by the time I finally pulled myself up onto my knees and managed to speak.

 Aurelia shrugged.

Eyes low, he stepped out into the night, Aurelia trailing not far behind.
 They travelled deeper into the town.
 A knot grew in her stomach as she noticed he had both his swords, and as they approached the poorer parts of the town, the knot only tightened.
 She watched the half-orc glance in through the windows of the buildings he passed.
 She found herself praying he only meant to steal possessions…‌just possessions, nothing more.
 _Keep the swords sheathed,_ she prayed.
 _Sheathed and bloodless._
 He continued wandering, and she found herself circling several streets multiple times.
 Stalling, she thought, but it was little comfort.
 The day was almost done, the town covered with long shadows and darkened spaces.

 Readers are strongly advised to pick up Torn next and then proceed on to Splintered.
 The most cost effective way to purchase Splintered is as part of the Bitten Reflections Story Bundle.
 Bitten gets you the next six installments of the Reflections series—plus a bonus short story—for 37% off of the normal price.
 Author's Note: In some ways it feels like I've been at this for decades, in other ways it feels like I only just sat down to try and put Adri's story down in words.
 Now that it's live, I can only say that I hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
 If you haven't read Torn yet, please go check it out.
 When I set out to write Broken, I never expected that I was going to end up writing the same story from Alec's point of view, but I'm pleased with how both Broken and Torn have turned out, both individually and as a combined work.
 They are done in very different styles, but ultimately that was exactly what I was after.
 I think there is plenty of cross-over of guys reading paranormal romance, and girls picking up more action-packed stories.

I watched Ruby’s heeled boots as she led me through the main room and to the door to her bedroom.
 “A bath?” I asked, confused.
 She laughed.
 “Well, yes.
 A little cold for lake bathing here.” She led me to a large basin in the corner of her room.
 Water streamed in from the window and filled it halfway.
 “I’ve laid out some clothes for you and there are some lovely soaps on the table.” She spun and glided out of the room, closing the door behind her, and all I could think was, Lovely soaps.
 I examined the room as I undressed.
 A large bed topped with decorated pillows and colorful blankets centered the opposite wall, twice the size of the one I’d been using.
 A tall rack in the corner was draped with materials—deep violet and emerald-green silks, dark wools, and a rainbow of patterned scarves.

In the majority of developing countries, government is still the most organized and efficient agency and the only one capable of such significant initiative.
 In formulating strategies, it is essential to take fully into account both the stages and steps of the development process.
 At this stage in their development, it is highly unlikely that food-deficit African nations can make rapid progress toward food self-sufficiency without strong government support and investment to improve technology, training, techno-infrastructure and trade.
 Once the rural sector begins to exhibit its own dynamism, as in the majority of developing countries, there is strong justification for a shift in the role of government from that of prime mover, planner and controller of development to that of catalyst and pioneer.
 Government agencies can tap the potentials of agriculture, identifying new commercial opportunities, educating farmers, demonstrating new potentials, assisting in the transfer and dissemination of new technology, and promoting the establishment of effective organizations – preferably privately or co-operatively owned by farmers or at least with their participation – to process, distribute and market what is produced.
 Coping with the environmental problems to preserve the ecological foundations essential for sustainable agriculture is an area in which government has special responsibilities and must play a leading role on an ongoing basis.
 Regulating the diversion of prime farm land for non-farm uses, expansion of irrigation capacity, control of groundwater exploitation, major programmes for reforestation and to prevent or reverse desertification, and regulation of pesticide use can only be effectively planned, monitored and regulated by governments.
 Comprehensive Strategies
 In this and previous chapters, we have tried to present an integrated perspective of the political, economic and technological factors that need to be taken into account in formulating a comprehensive approach to the issues of peace, food and employment.
 In an effort to illustrate the potential efficacy of this approach in a country representing nearly 25 per cent of the world’s poor, ICPF conducted an in-depth country level study in India to evolve a strategy for stimulating massive increases in job growth and food production (see box pp.

It is an indication of what is possible, not a prophecy or projection of what is inevitable.
 It presents a set of real opportunities that can be tapped, provided that we take best advantage of the present situation.
 The progress it heralds is no more inconceivable and remarkable than the chain of recent achievements seemed seven years ago – yet those we have already come to take for granted and, underinsistent prodding by the media, to replace in our consciousness with ever new concerns.
 PROSPECTS FOR THE YEAR 2005
 According to the provisions of international treaty, the final batch of nuclear weapons has been destroyed, ushering in a world free of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
 Global military spending has fallen by nearly 50 per cent since 1994 to $400 billion per annum (in 1990 US dollars), half of which is now contributed to a global military force responsible for enforcing a total ban on war between nations.
 Not a single inter-state or civil war is raging due to the extension of the UN's mandate to prevent all forms of war and its vastly strengthened military capabilities.
 International drug trafficking has declined by more than 80 per cent since the signing of the UN declaration granting the UN special powers to eradicate the drugs trade.
 An accelerated schedule for dismantling trade barriers and the formation of regional economic unions, such as the Middle East Economic Area that incorporates Israel and the Arab states, and other initiatives to promote larger bilateral trade between countries and regions, have helped to more than double the growth rate in world trade.
 With the assistance of the UN's World Development Force, proposed in this report, food shortages have been eliminated from the last famine danger zones in Africa, and total food production on that continent has doubled within a decade.

Seth drew his sword and crouched down.
 He shuffled forward and motioned for us to follow.
 We slid through the trees as quietly as we could.
 I kept my eye on the faery men, waiting for one of them to turn around and notice us hiding in the trees.
 I ducked behind a tree and looked over just in time to see Emily trip and fall out of her bush.
 The faery and dwarves looked at her in surprise.
 I guess they’ve never seen a teenage half-ling girl fall out of a bush before.
 “Am I interrupting something?” Emily asked with a gulp.
 The faery men drew their double swords and charged at her.
 I released an arrow and it buried itself in one of their necks.

"She doesn't play now though.
 I've been into her room, and there's no violin there."
 "No, she doesn't play anymore.
 She stopped playing shortly after Mom finished up the piece you just heard."
 His expression was so serious now that I almost stopped him before he could continue.
 "She stopped when she realized that 'Welcoming' was the only celebration of childbirth mother was going to write."
 I felt my smile sour, and tried to turn away, but Alec caught my chin and gently pulled my face up, forcing me to meet his gaze.
 "You don't need to feel embarrassed.
 It's not something that's easy to talk about.
 It's even harder for Rachel to discuss, but sometimes those things still need to be examined.

“Yes I am.
 It's a lot better than hiding this on my own.
 The secret just keeps getting bigger.” I rolled my eyes.
 “Emily will find out eventually, and when she does, she'll kill you for keeping a secret from her.” “Let's hope it isn't until you and I figure this thing out.” I nodded and walked back into the cave.
 Emily and Jason watched us enter and I swallowed nervously.
 Seth gave me a small nod, signaling me to start telling them about my dream.
 “Listen guys, I had a dream,” I said and repeated my dream again, minus the part about Seth.
 Emily and Jason listened to every word I said.
 When I got to the part about Kojas, Emily's mouth made a small O and Jason's eyes widened.
 My voice shook as I recalled the dwarf's dead body.

"Thank you for the little fountain," Marie told Rick as he unlocked her car door.
 "I haven't bought it for you yet."
 "But you want to.
 You decided to as soon as I admired it.

 She linked her arms around his neck, smiling into his eyes and then raising her face to kiss him.
 His hands wandered over her back as he returned her kiss.
 "Wow," he murmured, resting his forehead against hers.
 "I predict our house is soon going to be full of all kinds of knickknacks and gadgets."
 Smiling, she pulled him closer for another kiss.

“The girls should take control.” I shrugged.
 “I guess if that's what you want to do.” Thankfully, there were no trees anywhere except one.
 The ground was mostly dirt and rock, easier to walk on.
 The mountains loomed ahead of us and something tingled down my spine.
 Something was going to happen in those mountains, I just knew.
 The sky was clearer here and also more windy.
 The wind tugged at my hair and clothes as I walked.
 I had to keep squinting to see through my hair.

It hadn’t seemed unusual to me, it was just the way it had always been.
 And besides, I could barely do anything aside from lighting candles.
 Was this why council was so quick to accuse me of practicing dark magic?
 It was rarely even discussed and never tolerated.
 What had Fannie done?
 I flipped through more of the pages, realizing something was out of place.
 It didn’t make sense official documents about Fannie would be among those relating to the apparent extinction of the northern clans.
 And why had all the documents I’d found about the tragedy been separated, mixed up, and missing pages?
 I tried to sort it out, but found there were other council documents there too.

It doesn't look good."
 I had my mouth open and was halfway to asking what was going on when I saw Alec's expression, and swallowed my words.
 He didn't look any different than normal, in fact if I'd been standing forty or fifty feet away from him I'd probably have still thought he was just as calm and in control as always.
 This close, I could feel the anger radiating off of him.
 I almost took a step back when he turned towards me.
 "I realize it's unreasonable to ask you to trust me right now, but I'm going to need you to do so.
 Can you remain quiet for the next few minutes?"
 I wanted to ask why, but it was obvious we didn't have the time for a lengthy explanation.

The last straw with Thomas was over Christmas many years back when he became so violent and threatening that Lisa and I decided to not see him or his family again.
 We even told our children that if Uncle Thomas came to our house or ever tried to get them in a car that they were to run to any other adult.
 We did not know what drug he was on or how far he would go.
 When he moved to southern California, we were not faced with Thomas’s problems anymore.
 I crossed him off of my list—the brother who had stood shoulder to shoulder with me through all the moves, the abuse, and so much else.
 The brother who for a while was all I had was completely estranged from me.
 I had put Thomas in a similar category as my biological Father, Richard.
 I considered that in both of their cases, nothing good seemed to happen when I associated with them so I just kept them out of my life and my family’s as well.
 The latest stories I had heard about Thomas were that while at one point he had escalated his abuse to injecting heroin, he then attended a drug rehab center called Narconon, which had apparently enabled him to be clean for the last couple of years.
 If this was true, and he was clean, maybe he’d be a good person to go to for help?

Illustrations and descriptions matched what I had seen.
 I know I took a risk extending Rune’s spell further, but I did not want to get caught, definitely not followed.
 I wondered if my sister was still at the original camp.
 Surely she wasn’t bright enough to figure it out.
 And apparently she wasn’t willing to tell anyone.
 I was returning to the spot I had found the humans the previous day when I ran across one of them alone.
 I hid myself behind a patch of brush to watch him.
 He had a lovely complexion with a hint of bronze and cropped dark brown hair with a few tiny streaks of blond just around his face.
 He looked less like the others I had been watching.
 He was built like the elves, strong and muscled, but still lean.

We met at a small church charismatic enough so that nobody minded when she stood in the midst of a service and offered her latest poem.
 Long ago, Olga had discovered that what she needed most was God.
 She would hike and pray her way up Cowles Mountain, a mile and a half of rocky trail, then call her best friend Warren so they could pray together, sometimes for hours.
 Then she might go to work, cleaning somebody’s home while listening to worship music.
 God, God, God.
 Here is another of her poems, a simple one I’m choosing because you can also find it on Youtube, read by my Zoë: Jesus, in the night you are my nightlight.
 Jesus, in the morning you are my daylight.
 Jesus, in the afternoon you are my sunlight.
 Jesus, in the evening you are my starlight.

"It's not safe, Adri.
 I don't want to leave you anymore than you want to be left, but it's the only option."
 "No, it isn't, just bring me along."
 His fist clenched, knotting up the covers next to my head, but I was long past worrying he'd lose control of his beast and hurt me by accident.
 "You heard Mallory.
 The odds are very good that I'm not coming back.
 If the worst happens, the rest of the pack may very well have to try and fight their way out of there.

 They took a tour of the movie lot, and Marie was excited to see the sets of some of the movies Rick had rented for her.
 The tram they rode crossed a bridge that shook as if it would collapse, and she screamed, clutching Rick's arm.
 A giant shark swam up to the tram as it crossed a river, and as they later emerged from a forest, it began raining, and a flood rushed toward them.
 With so many children on the tram, Marie knew that these "disasters" were just tricks, but she was still glad she could huddle in Rick's arms when the tram seemed to be in danger.

 Harruq shifted the body to a more comfortable position.

There is only one other group besides the Guild that has is allowed to give sigils, the Knights of the Soaring Heavens; from who the Gods choose their champions.” Imeralda and Doi’van had both become quite intrigued by what Rodregas was hinting at.
 He continued, “I was a squire in the Knighthood who was never raised.
 As you probably know most squires are not raised, only those of the most noble blood and those of greatest talent in both magic and the arts of a warrior.
 I was neither.
 I had thought that I would make a career in the army,” he paused after admitting that.
 His time as a squire was like magic to him, and his time in the army had been a living nightmare.
 “Once a year directly after the new group of knights is raised, a great competition is held; a five days open tournament.
 Any previous squire is eligible to compete.
 The winner of this competition is raised to knighthood,” Rodregas added.
 “You mean to enter the tournament for the right to knighthood?” asked Doi’van.

I handed the dark red stone to Chevelle, who only nodded as he took it from me, not examining it before he slipped it into a pocket to hide it away.
 There was a sound at the door and his fingers slid over my lower back, urging me into my room.
 I was closed in just as the main door opened, giving me no more than a glimpse of deep red curls.
 I tried not to be annoyed about being closed in a room.
 I was a prisoner after all.
 Chevelle’s voice was barely audible as he spoke to his visitor in a formal tone.
 “Ruby.” Ruby?
 Before I could stop myself, I was at the door peering through the frame.
 A tiny crack of light allowed me about three-quarters of Chevelle’s back and all of his guest.

 It'd been easier to lapse into catatonia this time than last.
 Would I reach a point where I couldn't come back?
 There'd been a time right after the accident where Mom had thought I was already there.
 I was just numb enough still to think about such things without immediately collapsing.
 Even so, I felt a pang of dizziness as my mind warned me I'd pushed it too far today.
 I found myself in the kitchen, nearly finished making enchiladas with only vague ideas of why I'd started pulling ingredients out of the fridge.

I stood there woodenly for several seconds, unsure whether or not she was through.
 She finally made a shooing motion and turned back to grading papers.
 Predictably, there were still a half-dozen other kids in the classroom.
 They all turned back to the door and started filing out again, but by tomorrow half the school would know exactly how badly I'd just been humiliated.
 I found myself just outside the tutor lab with no recollection of having stumbled to my locker, or going by Physics to grab the stuff I'd left there.
 Still, somehow my Spanish book had disappeared, replaced by my math book.
 My knees started shaking as I entered the room, but I made it safely to my normal table before they gave out.
 "Adri, Adriana?
 Excuse me."
 I didn't recognize the girl standing across from me, but based on her uncomfortable expression and the fact that more than one person had turned for the sole purpose of watching us out of the corner of their eyes, she'd been standing there longer than I'd realized.

 The prospect of trying to catch up, all the while needing to master new material and deal with a full schedule of other classes, was too much.

Proven technology exists in many fields that await application because people do not know or do not believe that it can be employed successfully.
 Imitation of intensive aquaculture methods commonly employed by farmers in Taiwan and Singapore can raise average fish yields in South Asian, African and Latin American countries 25-fold.
 Advanced methods for micro-nutrient management can double or quadruple fruit and vegetable yields in most developing countries.
 A complete list of proven but untapped technologies and commercial opportunities should be compiled for each country, each region and local area.
 Programmes should be initiated to publicize information about commercialization of agriculture, stimulating industrialization, encouraging self-employment and new business start-ups, improving management practices, etc.
 Role of the media
 Free and well-developed media are vital to democratization and development.
 For this very reason, the dissemination of information by the media carries with it a great responsibility that cannot be effectively shouldered where private profit is the sole motive, or government control limits freedom of expression.
 The media can play an invaluable role in disseminating relevant information to the public, but the type and quality of information being carried in most developing countries must be radically improved.
 The worldwide tendency to focus on the immediate and dramatic at the expense of that which could make a substantial and lasting contribution to development requires greater efforts to creatively present socially useful information in an easily accessible and interesting form.

The future of work will offer increasing opportunities for people throughout the world to match their specialized knowledge and skills with specialized employment opportunities wherever they may originate.
 Meeting the Skill Shortage: Perhaps the single greatest opportunity for employment growth lies in addressing the growing mismatch between the skills of job seekers and the skills required for expanding economies.
 In both industrial and developing countries, workers may be in surplus, but the skills needed are in deficit.
 In the most prosperous nations, the deficit is concentrated in high technology and professional sectors, in electronics, biotechnology, health care, pharmacology, mathematics, marketing, financial services, and the like.
 The adoption of new technologies even in traditional occupations has resulted in a growing demand for higher skill levels in these fields as well.
 Unemployment is highest among the least educated, least skilled categories, such as machine operators, fabricators and labourers.
 The poor are poor both because they have no assets and because their time and labour have low or no economic value.
 Poverty persists wherever the human resource is under-valued.
 To eradicate it, there is need for a paradigm shift from unskilled to skilled work.
 While educated unemployment is high in many developing countries, in most cases the quality and relevance of the education to employment opportunities is far from adequate.

st prosperous nations, it is92m not0m92m enough0m to92m make0m a good wage for a job that is unskilled. The skills are not92m enough0m to make a good wage for a job that is skilled. The skills92m are0m not enough to make a good wage for a job that is not skilled.<eop><eod>

Art – I had to hear about it for weeks after it happened.
 Some of the words she used weren’t very magical, at best they could have been described as explicit.
 I wasn’t even aware that she new some of those words.
 I must say some of the combinations she used were quite imaginative.
 Karen – Were they?
 I think I’d like to hear them then, too bad you can’t get away with calling that art.
 Art – Why couldn’t you?
 Karen – The censors would have a conniption.

 He looked up at me for the first time, and the tortured look in his eyes made me hold onto his hand as tightly as I was able.

They asked me what I wanted from the nearby hamburger joint as they relayed orders to another officer via a cell phone.
 I wanted nothing!
 Eating was the last thing on my mind and my stomach was churning with every passing moment.
 I just wanted to get on with it and go home in one piece.
 It was an odd sight for me as I watched these officers chow down their burgers and sip on their drinks reminiscing about the drug deal they just finished.
 Just another day at the office, I guess.
 In a moment, my crack-berry starts to blow up with one call after the next from Ashley, wanting to know when we are doing this deal.
 I must keep buying time with excuses, now nearing a two-hour delay waiting for the cops to come from the other bust.
 It is looking like this deal is not going to happen either.
 I answer some of the calls and ignore others as I am instructed to do by Officer White.

utes later though, Ashley is back at work and again, I answer some calls and ignore others as92m I0m am instructed by Officer White.<eop><eod> I am92m now0m in a drug addiction. I am92m trying0m to92m get0m out of it, but I am unable to fight it92m.0m I am in a drug deal

I prepared myself emotionally for another unpredictable evening.
 I was told to meet the officers at a different location behind a nearby grocery store near the loading dock and trash bins.
 I arrived promptly, eager to get this thing done, and was immediately disappointed to learn that there would be a delay getting the crew together as they had just busted an Ecstasy dealer and part of the crew was stuck hauling, booking and questioning him.
 I was irritated as they wired me up in anticipation of the bust.
 The officers then recorded my call to Ashley where I told her my wife had me watching the kids and unavailable until she returned, so I’d call her in a while.
 I was buying an unknown amount of time while keeping Ashley and Steve on the hook.
 So while I am standing in the lot wired up, not able to call my wife, not able to go anyplace myself, some of the officers take orders for a hamburger run!
 I am now beyond irritated, as their lackadaisical attitude could equal another disappointment and a setback for the mission to get my son on with his life and out of a possible prison sentence.
 They asked me what I wanted from the nearby hamburger joint as they relayed orders to another officer via a cell phone.

A knowledge of weather patterns boosted productivity in agriculture.
 A knowledge of astronomy enabled sea-worthy vessels to travel across the oceans to distant lands.
 This led to the invention of systematic education as a method to pass on acquired knowledge and skills to the next generation and thereby continuously increase them.
 The Ultimate Resource
 These rich and varied discoveries came as the result of a careful observation and analysis of the external world around us, an infinite exploration and experimentation with things, an endless trial and error blending of minerals and plants to forge metals and produce medicines.
 As a result, for millennia we have tended to overlook or, at best, grossly underestimate the greatest of all resources and the true source of all the discoveries, inventions, creativity and productive power found in nature – the resource that has made minerals into ships that sail the skies, fashioned grains of sand into tiny electronic brains, released the energy of the sun from the atom, modified the genetic code of plants to increase their vigour and productivity – the ultimate resource, the human being.
 World Food Prize recipient and father of India’s milk revolution, Dr V. Kurien, has decried the tendency to credit external factors for the accomplishment of people.
 ‘It is the farmer that has produced this miracle, not the cow.’ And so it can be said of the Industrial Revolution and the Green Revolution.
 Looked at from a different perspective, the entire evolution of civilization is a progressive act of humanity’s self-discovery.
 At each stage of external observation and exploration, people have discovered more of their own inner capacity for resourcefulness.

Imagine Henry David Thoreau as a neurotic who returns to Walden Pond and finds psychosis awaiting him there.
 Still, we concluded that a poet of Kerouac's passion and skill, who could make a hangover feel romantic, would pull out of his tailspin and rise again.
 That fall, Eric and I read most every day, then sat in my backyard or on a beach or sea cliff and talked for hours at a spell.
 Also, we worked at odd jobs, sold some possessions, and saved most of whatever our moms gave us.
 We needed gas money, so we could chase visions of Kerouac and his Beat pals through the places they haunted at the west end of their cross-country odysseys.
 Twice that fall, the minute school let out on Friday, we sped north on Highway 101.
 From Morro Bay to Santa Cruz, we followed the coast and made camp for the night on a cliff between Hearst Castle and Big Sur.
 Saturday, midmorning, we landed in North Beach, San Francisco.
 As we passed strip joints whose signage featured females twice as buxom as Lil' Abner's Daisy Mae, doormen beckoned and dared us to enter, though we were four years underage.
 We stood gawking at the posters on jazz clubs.

more than a month ago I could tell Kerouac had a deep love for music. I92m had0m no idea he had such a passionate passion for a craft92m.0m I thought it was something he had loved to do92m.0m Now he had the same passion92m for0m the craft of music92m.0m<eop> That fall, he

As they ran, a strange sight met their eyes.
 In the distance were hundreds of bodies lined in perfect formation.
 They held no torches or lanterns.
 The wind shifted, and upon its gentle flow the stench of death came to them.
 The villagers slowed, fearfully eyeing the line.
 The stars were bright, and there was no mistaking that something was amiss.
 They were no soldiers.
 Only a scattered few wore armor.
 Still, they stood in the straight lines of a disciplined army.
 A roar from Harruq at their heels spurred them on.

 “It's what you love the most about me.” I punched him in the arm.
 “Who said I loved anything about you.

Buddy Gardner, when I knew him was a sweet, soft-spoken man, a man driven by ambition, sure, but, underneath that, there was a humility and a human heart .
 It’s all here in these tapes, so enough said.
 Three weeks after these interviews were concluded, Buddy Gardner was found dead in his home, with a needle in his arm.
 Lorelei had disappeared.
 These tapes somehow also disappeared until 1999, when they were found in a stockroom in an abandoned studio in Los Angeles by a technician there who, with some heaven-sent Extra Sensitive Perception, sent them to Camel Jeremy Eros, c/o City Lights Bookstore, where for a while I was taking my mail, while recovering from a broken relationship, one that emasculated me, silenced me, did me up a treat.
 These tapes were a godsend—they took me out of myself, out of the self-pity I was wallowing in.
 Many thanks to John Wender, editor extraordinaire, who recognized what we had here and ran them in his celebrated periodical.
 Hence, they ran first, almost in the form represented here, in three installments in Big City Magazine.

It didn't smell as good as the sunscreen, so she wasn't tempted to rub any onto her own skin.
 "Thanks, honey--this'll feel great."
 He rubbed some on his legs and then stripped off his shirt.
 Marie watched in fascination as he applied the lotion to his arms and chest.
 When he was finished, she told him, "I'll do your back."
 "Thanks."
 She used both hands, slowly rubbing the lotion over every inch of his back.
 She couldn't even imagine touching Davis like this, and she didn't think it had anything to do with morals.
 She just didn't feel comfortable enough with him to do something this personal.
 Yet here she was running her hands all over the back of a man she'd known only a week.

 CHAPTER FOUR
 Marie sat beside Rick at the library, watching in amazement as titles of books and magazines appeared on a screen in front of him.
 Whenever he found something that he thought could help them, a machine in front of her would print the title and its number on a piece of paper.
 She'd thought it would take hours and hours to find a handful of books.
 But in only 45 minutes Rick had a long list of books and articles.

There was no deterring Thomas from his occupation, as he believed himself invincible—as all drug dealers do.
 I had watched other old friends get hauled off to jail and I didn’t want the same for my brother.
 One afternoon, I called Thomas and a strange voice picked up the phone.
 I asked for Thomas and the person on the phone said, “He is unavailable right now, but tell me what you want and I will get it ready for you to pick up.” It was obviously a cop, and I knew my brother was probably sitting there in handcuffs while they set up every idiot who called for drugs, then collected them like goldfish as they swam into the net.
 I called my mother and told her I thought Thomas had been busted; time would confirm he had.
 Everyone knew what he was doing, including my mother, but she just didn’t want to admit it to herself, and there was nothing she could do to stop it anyway.
 Later, I watched the evening news and saw reporters standing outside Thomas’s house announcing a record cocaine bust.
 Thomas was sentenced to several years in a federal penitentiary in Texas.
 He would have spent far more time if he hadn’t set up his dealer, who was an even bigger fish in the drug world.
 One of the hardest things I have ever done is accompany my mother to Texas to visit her son, my brother Thomas, in prison.

"Wait.
 You need to put on shorts and a shirt over your bathing suit."
 "Oh.
 OK."  She went to do as he said.
 Marie had been to the shore before, but it had been years ago.
 Her father didn't think it was appropriate for a young woman of her position to be parading around half naked.
 If only he could see her now, she thought with a grin as she took off her shirt and shorts.
 There were only a handful of other people on the beach.
 Rick and Marie went for a stroll--or rather, Rick strolled while Marie ran into and out of the surf.
 When they returned to their blanket an hour later, she was tired enough to be talked into sunbathing for a while.

'0mt wait to go again," Rick said with a smile as92m he0m laid down in his blanket. Marie was92m still0m awake. "I can't wait to go again. Your dad told92m me0m that he wants me to go to the beach."<eop>92m 0m"Of course. I

What else could he be?
 He thought of Aurelia only once before he spoke.
 Her face was a white knife in the darkness of his mind, and he buried her deep within his heart as he yielded to the wisdom of his brother.
 “Yeah,” Harruq said.
 “I understand.”
 “Good.
 Now come.” The two resumed traveling up the small hill.
 They stopped again, however, for from their vantage point they could see the village.
 “See the torches?” Harruq asked, pointing.
 His brother nodded.

Chapter Seven of the Commission’s report examines some of the principal means at our disposal to enhance and accelerate the development of these human capacities.
 It called for efforts to re-examine our development experience over the past few hundred years in order to arrive at a deeper and clearer understanding of the process and principles that govern human evolution, individually and collectively.
 Since the publication of the report in 1994, ICPF’s successor organization, the International Center for Peace and Development, and The Mother’s Service Society in collaboration with the World Academy of Art and Science have worked to formulate a broader theoretical framework for understanding human development.
 Strategies arising from this approach were presented at international conferences co-sponsored with the Gorbachev Foundation in Moscow and with the Noor al Hussein Foundation in Jordan, and were effectively applied to stop hyperinflation in Yugoslavia.
 A full and conscious application of strategies arising from this framework can help to condense the period of transition of East European countries and the take-off of less developed countries from decades into a few years.
 From this perspective, the single most important agent of human development is not the institutions of government or those of private enterprise.
 It is the educational system that imparts to future generations the accumulated knowledge, skill and capacity acquired in the past.
 The quality of that education will determine the quality of the human beings who build our future world.
 Until now, too much emphasis has been placed on transfer of information from teacher to student, too little on the development of thinking and critical faculties by the student.
 Too much reliance has been placed on the capacity of the teacher to teach, too little on the inherent natural capacity of human beings for self-motivated learning and self-discovery.

oncern is to ensure that human capacities become more and more relevant to society, as the period of political transition approaches. In this way, we can concentrate action92m on0m the areas in which human92m development0m is most important. We have been working92m on0m the development of human capacities for a long time92m.0m92m we0m have been

A purple fire surrounded the bones, pulled them into the air, and then hurled them in a giant wave.

 They shattered his bow, crashed into his slender form, and tore flesh and armor.

 They swirled in the air above the elf like a tornado, and all at once they plunged downward, deep into his flesh.

Expanding World Trade: Trade is playing an increasing role in the economic growth of developing countries.
 Economic integration with the global economy has become a compelling necessity for every country.
 The share of trade in global GDP rose from 12 per cent in 1970 to 29 per cent in 2001.
 While the effects of expanding world trade on employment are complex and can lead to displacement of workers and destruction of jobs in some cases, available evidence strongly indicates that the overall impact of freer trade on the global economy will be to promote significantly faster growth of employment opportunities.
 The emerging liberalization of textile trade in 2005 is an example of the potential positive impact of freer trade.
 In India the textile industry provides employment to 18 per cent of the entire workforce, accounts for 8 per cent of the country's GDP, 17 per cent of its manufacturing capacity, and 27 per cent of its export earnings.
 A recent projection indicates that with the lifting of quotas under the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing in January 2005, India’s textile exports could rise from the current $16 billion to $40 billion by 2010, creating as many as 12 million new jobs in the process, five million jobs through direct employment in the textile industry and another seven million jobs in allied sectors.
 The global manufacturing strategies of multinational corporations will further spur the exponential growth of contract manufacturing opportunities in developing countries.
 Already China exports $300 billion a year in manufactured products, while Taiwan and Mexico export more than $140 billion each.
 According to a recent study, India has the potential to create 25 to 30 million new jobs in the manufactured exports sector.

working in the textile sector since the early 1990s,92m which0m has resulted in92m a0m dramatic increase in the number of jobs92m in0m the textile industry. This is not to say that India is an under92mdeveloped0m country. It has a rich history of manufacturing industry and has the tremendous potential to92m expand0m its textile industries.

While foreign aid to developing countries as a percentage of GDP has fallen by 50 per cent since 1990, it has been offset to some extent by a 150 per cent rise in foreign investment.
 In the least developed countries, foreign aid has declined by 24 per cent but this has been offset by a 29-fold increase in foreign investment, so that the combination of foreign aid and foreign investment as a percentage of GDP has remained constant.
 If the rich countries, particularly USA, had met the UN development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of GDP, progress in improving the human condition in countries characterized by a high incidence of poverty would have been faster.
 These real and significant gains have been offset and to a large extent obscured in our minds by the persistence and aggravation of problems that constitute the other side of the post-Cold War ledger.
 Far from vanishing, the nuclear danger has been aggravated by the continued proliferation of nuclear weapons, the increasing danger of these weapons falling into the hands of terrorists, and the stubborn refusal of the existing nuclear powers to seize the opportunity to totally eradicate this pernicious arsenal of self-annihilation.
 Reduced confrontation between nation states has been followed by an aggravation of internal conflicts within countries as well as a dramatic increase in threats of violence by disenchanted minorities.
 Violent local conflicts continue to flare around the world.
 Terrorist acts have intensified against civilian populations on every continent.
 While the worst fears about rising unemployment in the West have been dispelled, the challenge of generating sufficient employment opportunities for all people around the world remains a pressing concern.
 The rich-poor divide has increased within and between nations.

Out came his swords.
 Standing before him was Dieredon, his bow held in both hands like a staff.
 Long blades stretched out from either end, tiny razor teeth lining the front.
 The elf twirled the bow in his hands and then charged.
 Two quick hits batted one of Harruq’s swords out and away.
 A feint, so quick Harruq blocked on instinct, took care of the other.
 His weapons gone, the half-orc was exposed.
 Dieredon wasted no time smashing the half-orc’s groin.
 As he doubled over in pain, a snap kick smacked his chin, splattering blood and forcing him to drop.

Maybe I just lacked the maturity to appreciate Bronte's so-called masterpiece, but I couldn't stand that her characters were almost all really nasty people.
 I wondered what else we'd be reading.
 I could always ask Britney, but the odds of her knowing anything useful seemed pretty slim.
 When the bell finally released us from an analysis of Heathcliff's early depravity, Britney asked what my next class was.
 She was elated to find we were both headed to Algebra.
 As we trailed the other students out of the class, I wasn't so sure I was equally enthused.
 Nobody had said anything to either of us.
 It was starting to look like Britney was receiving just as much of a cold shoulder as I was.
 And she'd been here an entire year.
 It was bad enough not fitting in because you preferred your own company over that of your peers.

But she blushed at her profile.
 She filled the front of the bathing suit, and the curve of her hips was all too apparent.
 To her eyes, she looked bulky.
 She didn't want to go out there and ask Rick's opinion.
 She blushed again at the thought of people seeing her like this.
 But people would see her at the shore tomorrow, so she pushed the curtain aside and stepped out.
 "Rick?"
 He looked around.
 And his mouth fell open.
 She had a fantastic body.

Isaac could've connected with his claws instead of his fist."
 Jasmin and Jessica were circling each other now.
 It reminded me of a fight I'd seen between two feral dogs while I was still in grade school.
 The dogs had circled for five or ten seconds, and then one had thrown himself at the other.
 A neighbor had broken the fight up with a few thrown stones before it'd come to a grisly end, but it'd been obvious once the first dog had latched onto his opponent's throat that it was only a matter of time before the smaller dog would've died.
 This was exactly the same, only it happened faster as Jasmin blurred into motion.
 One moment she was growling at Jess from a distance of more than five feet, the next instant she was on top of Jess, and her teeth were latched around the smaller wolf's throat.
 Dominic's hand tightened on mine as Jess began to whine, but Alec took a menacing step forward and Jasmin released Jessica with another growl.
 "She didn't want to let go, did she?"
 Dom looked for a second like she wasn't going to answer, but she finally shook her head.

Brandon took my head shaking as denial of what he'd said, rather than disbelief regarding the situation.
 "I promise that every word I just told you is true.
 More importantly, I promise I'll make sure nothing terrible happens to you."
 Looking into Brandon's caring eyes, I almost couldn't believe any of it.
 Being threatened and then having the perfect man come to your rescue didn't happen in real life.
 Then again, maybe I was due for some happy endings.
 With a sigh, I thanked him for the ride, and we parted ways.
 The only thing of note that happened in Biology was that for a few moments at the beginning of the hour it almost seemed that the near-constant stares had somehow changed and taken on a more sympathetic tone than they'd had previously.
 It seemed silly to even entertain the idea.
 People my age don't really do sympathy very well.

Its charter could also include specific provisions for close association with other international forces.
 Its combined strength and technological capabilities would exceed those of any of its members and constitute a substantial deterrent to aggression against any member country.
 It would significantly reduce the costs of security for members, possibly by up to 50 or 75 per cent, without compromising their legitimate security needs.
 The more members, the lower the defence expenditure required by each, both because the collective force would be larger and because the number of potential adversaries would be reduced proportionately.
 The organization of a World Army, run on well-defined and transparent lines with appropriate mechanisms for control and responsiveness, would help eliminate the need for countries to maintain their own large standing armies.
 Ultimately this could enable other nations to follow the lead of Costa Rica, which abolished its military forces several decades ago.
 National Sovereignty and International Responsibility
 The recent calamities in Rwanda and Somalia following the outbreak of civil and ethnic war, and in Bosnia following the breakaway of several Yugoslav republics, demonstrate the need for substantially improving international mechanisms for war prevention, peacemaking and peace keeping, and for protection of basic human rights both between and within states.
 The effort of the international community to deal with these events has brought to the fore fundamental issues regarding national sovereignty and the responsibilities of the world community.
 The very definition and sanctity of the state have been blurred by the determination of ethnic groups in various nations to declare independence from their parent bodies, and the inability or unwillingness of national governments to maintain law and order and provide basic security for their citizens.

92m is0m responsible for national security and the security of its citizens. It92m must0m be equally responsible for ensuring the security of its own citizens as well as for the security of the citizens of other countries.

If either of you think he is going to cast a spell, kill him.” The other two nodded at Rodregas.
 Rodregas reached down and slid the blade under the sorcerer’s chin and said, “One spell and you die,” he then nodded to Doi’van and the Hellborn lifted his hand a few inches from Van’dret’s mouth.
 Van’dret whispered, “Please, I am bleeding.
 I need to see a healer.” Rodregas stared at the sorcerer in disbelief.
 He suffered a few minor injuries and he expected they would just go get him a healer?
 The man killed people to steal their bodies and power.
 How could he think they would respond to such a request?
 “Please hurry, I need a healer now,” Van’dret demanded.
 “We will get you a healer as soon as you finish answering our questions,” said Doi’van, his voice more growl than speech.
 “First tell us who among the Immortalists are trying to break ‘The One Law’ and why,” “I can’t,” Van’dret whimpered.

“Of course,” she responded.
 “But it will probably be harder and slower than if you were learning earlier in life.
 It requires relearning something that is almost an instinct at this point in your life.
 Part of the problem is that the spell to activate the magic in the bow is just very different than anything you have probably done before.” Rodregas knew she was speaking the truth.
 He had never thought he was going to be some powerful mage.
 The fact that Doi’van had so easily learned the spell just reminded him of how many times in his life he had failed to have the ability to succeed in things that he really wanted.
 Rodregas’ new body was very gifted, but it was still mortal and some things he would just not be able to do as well as others.
 In some ways this was reassuring, a connection to his past.
 “Can I ask you a question?” she asked.
 Rodregas smiled and said, “of course, what?” “Have you thought of trying to become a sigil warrior?

hink0m that the bow might92m just0m be92m the0m thing for you at this point in your life?” She replied, “Yes, it makes me very nervous.” Rodregas nodded and told her what he wanted to know. “You92m are0m very good at the bow. You are really an experienced one92m.0m

I remember one, in particular, an Aztec poem, and it began, “Rejoice, rejoice, my flower king, you own many jewels—“ and I thought, wow, that’s for me, man.
 It was an egotistical reaction, I know.
 Where “Flower King” comes from.
 And there were these little altars she had constructed, with tiny clay figures and candles.
 And the floor—what there was of it (laughs)—like I say, was awash in album covers and books.
 Books stacked in these tottering towers.
 Names I’d never heard of, at that time: Kis, Malcolm Lowry, Svevo, Madame Blavatsky, Fludd, Dee, Goncharov, Bruno Schulz, Philip Wylie, Whatsername Yates, Blake, Maturin, Borges, Marie-Louise von Franz,  a book called History of Secret Societies, one, I think called On the conjuring of angels.
 It was mind-boggling.
 The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage.

She looked beyond me at the few inches of open floor, and I took the opportunity to bolt past her down the hall, straight out the door at full speed.
 I ran from the house, ignoring the paths; other elves would be no help to me.
 I kept running until I was certain she wasn’t coming, and then I collapsed at the edge of a meadow, breathless.
 I dropped my face into my hands, and might have wept if I’d not been so fueled by fear and adrenaline.
 “Freya?” a soft voice asked.
 I looked up, startled.
 Chevelle stood just in front of me.
 He dropped to his knees and reached out to touch the mark across my cheek.
 Shame flooded me, and I turned my head to hide the evidence, but his hand cradled the side of my face.

He nearly sneered his answer, “Through magic, of course, a simple tracking spell.” Van’dret did not go small, “Are you three responsible for the death of the Immortalist Sorcerer Ravenhurr?” “Yes and no,” responded Rodregas.
 He almost left it at that, but decided to continue, “I killed Ravenhurr during the Ceremony of Ascension.
 I threw him into his own consuming flames.
 The other two I did not meet until afterwards.” At Rodregas’ response Van’dret stared at him, “You killed an Immortalist Sorcerer by yourself in his tower?
 You truly claim that?” Rodregas almost laughed.
 He did chuckle a bit as he said, “First, you want me to admit that I killed an Immortalist Sorcerer, and when I do, you don’t believe me.
 An old soldier like me just can’t win.” Van’dret was too smart not to pick up his hint, “An old soldier?” he asked very quietly.
 “My turn to ask a question,” said Rodregas.
 “How did you connect the three of us to these crimes?” Van’dret shrugged and smiled and said, “To be honest, I did not really think you were the ones.
 I simply did not like you, and the way you hung out with non-Celestials.

My Uncle Dan lived there also.
 My grandfather was a very volatile person, a hateful man, and he clashed with his son—my Uncle Dan—often.
 They physically fought, and my uncle was no match for his father.
 My grandfather, a retired oil driller from Oklahoma and Kansas, drank a lot.
 His skin was Indian-dark, and the wrinkles on his face were deep.
 My brother and I would hide when they fought, and my mother would hold us if she was there, placing her hands over our ears and cradling us close to her.
 Her body muffled the sounds.
 She would rock slightly while humming or singing quietly so we would drift off to anyplace but there.
 We stayed because we had no place else to go, just as my uncle and my grandmother did.

A gravel pathway cut its winding way between real, live grass before terminating in a sandy courtyard that my eyes had been avoiding, almost as though my mind wasn't ready to deal with what it knew it would see there.
 The pack had turned at our appearance and six sets of unblinking, inhuman eyes stared up at me.
 A low growl sounded from one of the throats, and Donovan edged in front of me as the largest of the figures turned and struck out at another of the shape shifters with blurring speed.
 A startled yelp bounced off of the valley walls, and then Donovan relaxed slightly and started forward.
 "We should be safe now.
 Master Alec seems to have things well in hand."
 His word choice didn't inspire an overabundance of confidence, but I could hardly turn and run away after begging to be allowed to come watch.
 The path seemed to shrink as we were walking, and almost too quickly sand replaced the crunch of gravel under our feet.
 I recognized Alec's humanoid form from before, a massive, black, heavily furred tower of muscle, claws and fangs.
 I might have pulled back at his approach, but the eyes, even with their vertical pupils were still undeniably his.

I answered Britney's whispered questions without ever registering them and never once worried about whether or not I'd made sense.
 I parried Mrs. Campbell's concerned inquiries in much the same manner, probably not convincing her that I was okay, but at least persuading her to leave me alone, and then sleep-walked into the cafeteria.
 I hated the fact that I wanted Brandon to come sit down with me.
 If he did a convincing enough job pretending to like me and I tried really hard, maybe I'd believe it'd all just been my imagination.
 It'd be one less piece of my world crumbling out from under me.
 Britney slammed her tray down, but my listless gaze didn't move from the vacant corner where Brandon usually sat.
 A few minutes later a group of girls came to join us.
 I recognized them, but didn't bother putting names to the faces.
 It was like I got hit with another panic attack.
 Somehow I lost an hour, but nobody was running around calling for an ambulance so I must have at least responded to direct questions.

They reached the western gate, which remained open during the day.
 Without ceremony, they were kicked through, both falling to the dirt and scraping their knees.
 “Get going,” one said.
 “See if somewhere else will take your mutt ass.”
 It was not just adrenaline that caused Harruq’s hands to shake, but Qurrah put his hand on his wrist and begged him to calm.
 “Never forget this shame,” he said.
 “Let it burn in you.
 Let it be a reminder of what I have always said.
 We are better, superior.

Too many rock lyricists—you can think of them as well as I can, say, that guy with Procol Harum, or that Emerson Lake and Palmer shit, or some of Jim’s stuff, which, to be honest, I can’t stomach, all that lizard king shit—they’re purposely making with the lit-rock attitude, you know?
 They want you to study their lyrics.
 I mean, “An idiot reigns in the ancient trees of the night,” or whatever the hell he says.
 Shit.
 What I’m saying, in a song like “Love for Lorelei” or “The Golden Apples of the Song”—new stuff, you haven’t heard it yet-- is that, here are my words, man, here’s my life in words.
 What I’m saying is what I mean.
 If I sing “I love you” over and over, that’s truth, man, that’s where I’m coming from, because I mean it, because I’m singing to Lor, and I love her, there’s no secret to it, there’s no murkiness, no florid touches, it’s just raw, like art should be, raw, simple, full of emotion.

While most of us played eight-ball or listened to Sunday’s dad, Ivan, an engineer, explain how things worked, Eric listened to the Messiah.
 I knew he loved Christmas, which was near.
 Besides, I had given up surprise at anything he might do.
 So I hardly noted the changes in his obsessions and moods, until Christmas day.
 It was the second anniversary of losing my dad.
 After the family party at my Aunt Evangeline’s place, where my dad had eaten his final meal, I drove to pick up Eric.
 He wanted to go to Sunset Cliffs, near Fort Rosecrans where his dad was buried.
 His dad, Carl Curtis, was an Army Air Force pilot who crashed during a test flight while Eric was still a baby.
 Sylvia blamed her sister Rosarie for the crash.

Even though whatever had happened seemed to have passed, neither man seemed in a hurry to go.
 Chevelle glanced at me occasionally but kept himself busy around the fire.
 Steed still played with his feather, eventually entertaining me with it.
 It spun toward me and turned down, tickling my arm and then my nose.
 I giggled despite my wariness, and reached up to rub my nose where the plume had brushed it.
 I noticed the map on my palms.
 “What about spells?” He eyed my hands.
 “Been working spells?” “Not on purpose.” He smiled.
 “Yes, spells can be dangerous.” “Yes,” I agreed, “but why do you need words for spells and not magic?” “A spell can be left, set with a trigger, or larger than your magic.

 Qurrah read the name, and then glanced at his brother.
 “That is our last name.”
 Harruq nodded.
 “Aurelia showed me.

The hope felt juvenile and ignorant but she clung to it tightly.
 The magic left her fingertips, and doing her best to calm her heart, she followed Harruq back home.

 It seemed Qurrah would leave it at that, but he clearly saw the apprehension on his brother’s face.
 “Tell me the truth,” he said.

Once again he followed up with the same move, stepping forward and slamming his shield forward to either knock his opponent’s weapon or knock the guard himself down.
 Unfortunately, when Rodregas hit this guard he matched his every move for move.
 The guard responded, slamming shield against shield.
 Rodregas had gotten too comfortable with his opponents not being able to match his strength.
 This guard did.
 The Immortal Guard had already launched himself forward and Rodregas’ own speed worked against him.
 As Rodregas’ short sword hit nothing but air, he felt the sharp agony of the guard’s blade piercing his thigh.
 Rodregas used his speed to throw himself back.
 But as he did, he felt another sharp cut hit his upper arm.
 The other men were moving in now that he was off balance.

“He is the man that you appear to be, whose body you now… have,” responded the maiden.
 “And what are you five named?” Rodregas asked.
 There was a pause at his question.
 He knew this was an important moment because once people say who they are they are much less likely to do violence.
 Rodregas did not understand the reason, but he knew that to be true.
 “I am Imeralda,” said the AElf maiden.
 Then came the Hellborn, “My name is Doi’vanaomeraldioan, but humans usually call me Doi’van,” he stated in a slow careful way in a very deep, deep voice.
 The leader, after a pause, said, “I am Audrian of family Corin.” The other two men identified themselves as Brit and Geor.
 Geor, the one with the torch, was blond and like the other men, unusually good looking and well built.

“There could be more,” Grey insisted.
 That brought me back, no matter how disturbing my realization was.
 “More?” Chevelle gave the bickering group an admonishing glare as he approached me.
 I could hear the alarm in my own voice when I repeated, “There are more council members coming for me?” He tried to calm me.
 “Frey—” I cut him off.
 “I won’t let you all pay for my crimes.” Confusion passed over their faces, everyone except for Chevelle.

Rodregas lacked the discipline to channel the power.
 Van’dret’s senses were acute on things arcane and he felt the coming flood of power as if it was a real physical thing.
 Van’dret spread his hands and made a frantic move that sent a corona of power around him.
 Of course no focused magic came near him, and what did occur startled even Rodregas.
 Imeralda was literally flying through the air and she had her dagger drawn.
 She did not land smoothly, colliding into Van’dret’s lower body, but she instantly straightened and thrust her dagger into Van’dret’s stomach.
 The dagger did not sink far; a few inches.
 Rodregas expected Van’dret to get his hands up and fend her off, but he seemed to be in shock.
 Imeralda pulled the dagger out and then viscously stuck it back in the sorcerer, her body moved with the stroke, clearly using every ounce of strength she had.
 Still the blade only stuck in a few inches, but Van’dret screamed and fell to the floor and started to drag himself away.

 "You're welcome.

 It seemed like a crime to deny her, but I knew Mom didn't have the spare money to send me on a two-hour trip to an opera.
 I was working now, but by the time I could save up enough to pay for gas, food, and a ticket, the production would've moved on.
 "I'm sorry, I'd like to go, but I just don't think I can.
 If it was running for an extra month or two I could probably save up enough money from tutoring, but it isn't, so it just isn't going to happen."

 Alec's father's was that of being able to heal himself more rapidly than normal, even for our kind.
 Thanatas, the legendary king who defeated the southerners, was said to be able to mold his own body, making powerful changes that made him unbeatable in combat."
 Mallory's explanation was tickling the back of my mind.
 "Is that why Brandon's unbeatable?"
 "Nobody is unbeatable, but yes, that's why Brandon is such a formidable adversary.
 His gift is more prosaic than most, it's just increased strength and speed, but that makes him more than a match for most normal hybrids."

The third time that he retreated after taking a blow, the guard went for the kill.
 The guard extended his whole body out in a lunge, thrusting his long sword out to its full length.
 The guard saw Rodregas’ braided leather armor and steel sword and thrust with the point.
 The lunge was perfect, the guard went for dead center, and even though Rodregas had been waiting for a similar move, the thrust almost caught him off guard.
 The guard had only one problem, one that he could not have anticipated.
 Rodregas had been taking easy swings, not revealing his true speed.
 Once the guard committed, Rodregas brought both of his swords down and met the lunging blade.
 Rodregas could not meet his sword edge to edge, but it was thrusting out and he caught it and pushed it down and to the left.
 At the same time he moved his body to the side and in close.
 Rodregas then dropped his right sword as he kept his left engaged, pushing the blue steel sword away.

They always sat like this now, and they frequently embraced during the day.
 And she loved it.
 She didn't have to trick him into holding her, didn't have to dance with him to get his arms around her.
 He liked holding her.
 And he'd been home at 5:30 every day, just as he'd promised--just because he wanted to be with her.
 Davis had never rearranged his schedule for her.
 Rick spent every moment of every evening with her.
 He'd even refused to play racquetball tomorrow with a friend who called last night because he wanted to spend both Saturday and Sunday with her.
 Marie blinked back tears of confusion.

I couldn’t fathom why he would be giving my family heirloom to this woman.
 The ruby had been in the vault with my mother’s possessions, along with the map that had brought us here, and now he was giving this Ruby my ruby.
 I shook my head; there must be a connection, some reason it would end here.
 Ruby drew a package from her cape and handed it to Chevelle, smiling a temptress’s smile.
 It was about two hands in size, wrapped in light brown cloth.
 He slid it under his cloak and it disappeared from my view.
 I couldn’t imagine what she had given him, but it must have been in trade for my stone.
 As I peered through the gap in the doorframe, the stranger’s eyes flicked to mine and I was sure she somehow saw me.
 I held my breath and jerked away from view, plastering myself against the wall.
 When she didn’t speak up to expose me, my pulse began to slow.

“Celestial Gods, please let my life be worth something in death, if not in life,” he prayed quietly.
 Captain Poir and Rodregas carefully put the two prisoners in the middle of their circles, and then stepped out.
 They each picked up small wooden clubs.
 Dale and Junnit stood across from the two of them holding matching clubs.
 The ceremony required the prisoners to stay in each circle unbound.
 The job of the guards was to remain outside the circle but make sure that the prisoners stayed inside.
 Metal would interfere with the magic so the guards held simple wooden clubs and wore only linen clothes with no metal fastenings.
 As Rodregas pushed the half AElf into her circle, making sure not to disturb the bluish sand covered in swirls of colorful small crystals, he was surprised at how vulnerable he felt without his armor but readied himself for the task at hand.
 He quickly reached out to the woman and pulled off her gag, as even that would count as a binding and would interfere with the ritual.
 He wanted to whisper to her as he removed it, and give her a hint of the desperate gambit that he was about to try, but he knew that it was not worth the risk of others overhearing.

By that Sunday morning when he showed up at Kenny Niedermeyer's, he might have gotten the whole message.
 I think about standing outside the basketball gym a month before his last day, when Eric could easily have run like he insisted Billy and I do.
 But he said “I’m going to stay and take my punishment.” “For what?” I asked, and he didn’t answer.
 For what?
 I still want to know.
 A favorite mystery writer of mine, Ross McDonald, earned this praise from a reviewer: “McDonald doesn’t write about crime.
 He writes about sin.” I think back to the day I spent asking kids whether they often felt guilty about something but had no idea what it was.
 Though I didn’t understand at the time, I was asking if they felt the darkness in their nature, the affinity for sin.
 Somewhere, I read, "All sin is the result of the failure to love."
 Over lots of years, I have noted voluminous evidence for that idea, and not a shred against it.

The men shuffled around nervously, their eyes searching for enemies that always seemed to be hiding beyond their vision.
 The guard captain unrolled the edict, his gut sinking as he realized where he stood.
 Long ago, man and elf had agreed to live together in peace.
 Now, on that very same spot, he would rescind that agreement.
 Beyond the clearing loomed several palisades.
 All nearby windows were closed, and several boarded.
 A few humans stuck their heads out their doors to glimpse the armored men trampling through their city.
 Most kept themselves far from danger.

I killed him.
 Whoever this is, he is someone else.
 Someone stronger.”
 He pointed into the darkness.
 “There,” he said.
 “He returns.”
 Robed in black, the figure approached unseen by the guards.
 He lifted his hands, which shone a pallid white in the fading moonlight.
 So very slowly their color faded, from white, to gray, to nothing, a darkness surrounding and hiding them.
 “What’s going on?” Harruq asked.

"While I can't for a moment understand why you've chosen to befriend Britney, I can't fault you on your willingness to help her despite her flaws."
 I should have been overjoyed I wasn't in trouble.
 Instead I felt guilty for being given far more credit than I deserved.
 I opened my mouth to object, but was waved back into silence.
 "Obviously I don't want you to make disrupting my class a habit, but that isn't why I wanted to talk to you.
 Your studies are coming along nicely, and I've heard quite a few good things about you from other sources, so I'd like to offer you a job."

Secure in the knowledge he could see me, I stuck my tongue out at him.
 "Hey, my survival instincts, or lack thereof aren't the point.

 "I suppose I deserved that.
 It's just more than a little unsettling how quickly you're putting pieces together.
 There really are things that aren't safe for you to know.

Luckily there was plenty to distract me.
 It looked like there'd been some kind of war behind the school.
 The flagpole had a massive dent in its base, and actually looked like it was leaning slightly to one side.
 The straggly grass, kept just barely alive by the nearly non-existent rain and infrequent watering by some anonymous grounds keeper, had been torn up.
 Large patches of reddish dirt had been exposed and the ground was scarred by gouges that looked like they'd been made by some kind of farm machinery except for being so irregular.
 My eyes were momentarily pulled back to the ground.
 Something about the gouges was tickling the back of my mind.
 Had I seen something like that before?
 Hiking maybe?
 Only I could count the number of hikes I'd actually participated in on one hand.

With you in such a position.” I didn’t know what she meant exactly, but she continued, “And my dear brother has been there for me all along, helping me with the elf parts.” She kept talking as she leaned forward, seemingly unaware I’d not spoken a word in response.
 Not that she’d given me much opportunity.
 I contemplated whether this was her usual behavior toward strangers or if she felt we had a special motherless bond.
 She ran her finger through the substance in the canister and it came out coated in a deep, dark green that had the consistency of grease, which she smeared across the base of my eyelid.
 She continued rambling as she coated various parts of my body with lotions and powders, smoothed my hair with a sweet-scented cream, painted my lips with a soft balm that smelled of spice.
 After she ran out of areas to work with, she opened a tall glass container with black liquid inside and dipped a cut braid of hair into the bottle.
 She drew it out, using the tip to brush an intricate design on the inside of my wrist.
 When she was finished, she leaned over and blew gently on the paint.
 Or ink?
 I was anxious to see the finished work.

"One tomorrow, one Tuesday.
 We'll get some brochures at the hotel and see what else sounds good to you for the rest of the week."
 They pulled up to the hotel minutes later.
 They checked into their rooms, which were side by side, and Rick suggested that Marie unpack while he ordered a pizza.
 "I don't feel like unpacking and sitting around.
 Can't we go out for dinner?"
 "Aren't you tired?"
 "No!

"And nothing has changed.
 She's been telling me for years now that I have the potential to develop a fairly spectacular gift, one that should it choose to manifest in a useful form, could be more than a match for Brandon's strength.
 Apparently I'm still right on the point of developing said gift, only our time has run out.
 I fight Brandon tonight.
 Besides, even if I were to develop a gift this instant, most of them require practice to master, and I'm not going to have a chance to do any of that."
 "I'm sorry.
 It's my fault that this all happened."
 Alec stopped and tugged me around to face him.
 "Don't be sorry.
 I wish this had happened a long time ago.

Dominic frowned at my gasp.
 "Oh no, I really look that horrid?"
 "No, you're gorgeous.
 All of you are amazingly gorgeous.
 I suddenly feel uglier than normal."
 I wasn't sure my reassurance had been prompt enough, but Jasmin jumped in with a self-satisfied smile.
 "She's right, about how beautiful you look, Dom, if not about how pretty she is.
 James is going to pant when he sees you."
 Rachel had started prepping for the dance early, doing first her own makeup, and then Jasmin's while I was still gone with Alec.
 By the time I'd returned, Rachel's youthful features had taken on a mature cast that'd make all kinds of boys wish they'd taken a risk and asked Alec's little sister out.

I often backed myself into a corner and curled there like a fetus, as if covering my balls and stomach were protection, as if I feared some attack of a physical nature.
 This is what the fear does to you.
 It’s totally debilitating, man.
 Nausea can unseat you, can defeat the strongest man.
 And it’s a nausea that is in your blood—your whole body is sick.
 And, you know, looking at it now, I think I was sick like the country was sick.
 I was nauseated for the USA, you dig?
 I took those deaths, that ignominious war, the whole queasy zeitgeist of the times and internalized them.
 And I couldn’t get away, not in a cabin, not in my music, not anywhere, man, because the enemy was me.
 And, dad, anyone who’s ever had that kind of stomach failure, where you feel like your whole system is shutting down on you, knows how bone-deep that kind of pain and fear is.

Just that mine is toxic to many.
 Not to worry though, I have pretty good control of it now.
 Nasty, poisonous stuff.” She laughed again, “You know, that’s what Chevelle thought I intended the first time I dusted you.” I recalled the panic in his voice before he whisked her away.
 As disastrous a night as that had been, this one hadn’t gone much better.
 “Ruby, please take Frey back to the house.” Chevelle was standing behind us.
 I was too exhausted to jump, but Ruby merely glanced back at him, not at all surprised he was there.
 Her face crinkled.
 “Didn’t go well?” He didn’t respond but was obviously frustrated.
 I couldn’t tell if it was with Ruby or whatever hadn’t gone well.

Brandon's grin was more than a little sheepish as he fished his phone out of a front pocket and checked to see who was calling.
 I didn't need his groan to know it was one of his friends.
 A selfish urge to try and make him ignore the call and continue to focus on me momentarily flared up, but I suppressed it.
 It was such a petty thing to do, and even worse was probably the quickest way to demolish whatever interest he might have towards me.
 I might be almost completely naive when it came to dating, but anyone who'd read more than a couple books, or sat through eight or nine chick flicks, totally knew that the quickest way to drive a guy off was to become controlling and manipulative.
 Unless maybe you were a cheerleader and you were talking about a guy who was used to dating cheerleaders.
 Which while I wasn't even close to the former, the latter actually described Brandon almost perfectly.
 I almost stopped midway through the action of opening my car door, but it was too late.
 Even if I'd picked the wrong course, the moment was gone.
 I had to just play it cool and leave or risk looking like a total loser.

"I realize it's unreasonable to ask you to trust me right now, but I'm going to need you to do so.
 Can you remain quiet for the next few minutes?"
 I wanted to ask why, but it was obvious we didn't have the time for a lengthy explanation.
 I nodded.
 "I trust you.
 After everything you've done, I know you wouldn't hurt me."
 Alec turned towards Rachel, but she shook her head before he could even open his mouth.
 "You don't even need to ask.
 I'll follow your lead, and try to look brave."
 He threw the door open and stalked into the house.

A voice hissed, “We will show him.” This was seriously starting to freak me out.
 It was like the dead were talking to me, and I shivered.
 Then I saw them.
 They slithered from the shadows of the trees and bushes.
 There hundreds of them, each easily my height.
 They were covered in black, grey green scales that were each the size of my hand.
 They were layered on its body like plated armor.
 Their beady dark, red eyes sent shivers down my spine.
 I slung my bow back over my shoulder and grabbed my hunter's knife from its sheath on my side.

Although the deficit in food production was only marginal that year, three million died for lack of strong administrative intervention to improve distribution.
 A marginal deficit could work havoc in the absence of an efficient and equitable public distribution network.
 While there is no scarcity of food in the world, there is also not a sufficiently organized effort to promote food security, precisely because the sense of urgency is lacking.
 Abundant opportunities exist to eradicate hunger, but in the absence of a catastrophic event, serious effort is lacking.
 Famine attracts media coverage, political and public attention, but chronic hunger does not.
 With global food surpluses accumulating, an organized effort can ensure food security for people everywhere.
 The challenge of achieving food security for all human beings is complex, for it depends on the interaction between multiple factors – technological initiatives to produce sufficient food; economic initiatives to stimulate sufficient employment opportunities and increase purchasing power; political initiatives to maintain a peaceful and stable environment, undisturbed by war or social unrest that can interfere with food distribution; and administrative initiatives to provide for those who are unable to provide for themselves due to poverty or during times of emergency.
 Peace, democracy, employment and food security are mutually interdependent.
 The efforts proposed to promote peace, democracy and employment generation will mitigate the problem of food security to a considerable extent.
 In addition, Chapter Five of the Commission’s report highlights direct interventions that are needed to address the problem at the level of agricultural productivity, among which the following are particularly relevant in the present context:

 Alec put me down with a slight start as soon as he saw his sister.

Not in the next two or three weeks at least.
 It felt like my whole world had just disappeared down a drain.
 I didn't suffer any real panic attacks, but more or less spent both days in a kind of despondency that wasn't much better than a full-blown attack.
 By the time Monday morning arrived I had vague memories of doing homework and not much else.
 The only positive from the whole weekend was the way my dream from Friday stayed with me.
 As I got ready for school I idly wondered if it would be possible to recreate the grotto in real life.
 Obviously not with the impossible, glowing water, but with the incredible, lush vegetation and the secluded pool.
 Then again, I'd seen Mom pull off some pretty crazy tricks with her camera, maybe there would be some way to simulate glowing water, some kind of photography trick I'd never heard of.

The sprained ankle had slowed me down enough that there was no way I was going to make it back to my locker before the bell rang.
 Still, I tried to be gracious when it went off just as I handed Mrs. North the papers.
 Based on the number of classrooms on the second floor, and the narrowness of the stairs, there was no point in trying to wait the crowd out.
 I gritted my teeth and limped out into the surge of bodies.
 Surprisingly enough, there were more familiar faces than expected.
 As I grabbed the handrail on the right, I noticed Isaac several feet ahead of me.
 Of course, it's hard to miss someone nearly six feet tall and almost as well-muscled as Alec.
 Even if he was partially hidden by Vincent, who was strutting along a little higher up the stairs with all of his usual arrogance.
 If Isaac had been the one close enough to reach out and touch, I probably would've tried to get his attention and said hi.
 With Vincent, I just stayed quiet and hoped he wouldn't notice me.

It was the body of Gerald, not Rodregas.
 Her body was everything that he had thought it would be, both wonderfully hard and lush.
 To say she was the most beautiful woman he had ever enjoyed touching was a ridiculous understatement.
 Imeralda reached up to his neck and pulled herself up on top of his lap.
 She wrapped her legs around him and hoisted herself up like she was climbing the trunk of a tree.
 He had wanted to take his time and explore her with his hands and lips, but clearly she was in no mood for foreplay.
 Rodregas in turn was in no mood to stop her now that his own passion was building, and there was no reason to think that they would not be repeating this experience.
 There would be other times to explore her.
 Now was time to give in to their most primal needs.
 For one last moment he held her back, slowing her movements.

Just come out and tell him that I love him?
 Cleo – No Elizabeth, you tell him that you love him, and give him an instructional pamphlet with diagrams and small words, not too much in the way of color and shapes because he might get distracted and forget to read the text, not to mention ignore you when you’re exposing your deepest feelings.
 Liz – So your entire theory on men is that they’re complete imbeciles incapable of doing more than dressing themselves.
 Cleo – Dear, most men shouldn’t be allowed to even pick out their own clothes.
 But no they’re not complete morons, they’re quite handy to when it comes to making the clock on the video recorder stop blinking 12:00 for all eternity.
 But when it comes to important things, like knowing what a woman wants, well they’re hopeless.
 Even on the rare occasions that they actually are paying one hundred percent attention to us, which doesn’t happen as often as it should.
 They’re just simple minded, and it’s better that you learn than now than later.

She kissed Marie's forehead and left.
 Marie curled up next to Rick's t-shirt still clutching his handkerchief.
 She felt so empty.
 She didn't sleep well that night but woke up early nevertheless.
 After bathing, she put on her emerald underwear and a simple white dress and went out into the garden.
 It didn't look so different from Rick's, she decided.
 They didn't have any white roses like he did, nor an electric fountain, but they had red roses and azaleas, just as he did.
 She wished she'd brought back a picture of him.
 But a picture wouldn't help much, she knew.
 She wanted to be in his arms, kiss him, touch him.

They went to bed early that night because they had to be at Paramount at 7:00 the next morning.
 Marie, fortunately, didn't question the earliness of the hour.
 The surprise he had for her hinged on the word of a friend of a friend, and he didn't want her to find out about it and then have it fall through.
 Traffic was terrible the next morning, but he managed to find the gate he'd been told to go to.
 The attendant had his name on a list and gave him directions to stage three.
 "Why did your name have to be on a list?"
 Marie asked him.
 "That's the only way to get in."
 "How did you get your name on the list?"
 "I-I called.

Brandon was mistaken thinking that he was smarter than everyone else because while he was the dealer, other people—addicts—hung on his every word as though he was speaking gospel.
 The person dishing out the drugs rambles stupidly and thinks his admirers should be carving his wise words in a stone tablet.
 Been there, seen that with Thomas and others!
 We had been giving him regular drug tests, which showed levels of positive, and that line had been starting to drop.
 It seemed to be leaving his system— it took a while to be completely clean.
 But at some point during the intervention, in between the crying and the lying, it occurred to me that this boy didn’t look like he was suffering the effects of withdrawals.
 His symptoms seemed to be suddenly better and his detox wasn’t as severe as we thought it would be or as bad as it had been the first time years before.
 And I cocked my head and listened more carefully to his lies— the lies which I suddenly realized were consistent with his past behavior when he was high.
 Stop the presses!
 I sprung up and shook my finger in the air in front of his face.

That conversation left a bad taste in Rick's mouth, and he arrived at Ted and Lauri's that evening feeling wary.
 "Hi--I'm glad you said to dress casually," Rick greeted Ted, shrugging out of his coat.
 "I hate to get dressed up when it's raining."
 "Sharon insisted.
 She said set-ups are awkward enough without all the formality."
 He hung Rick's coat in the closet.
 "I might like this girl after all.

 "Not here yet."

 A grin spread wide across his ever-changing face, chilling Harruq’s spine.
 “If the humans win, the elves will declare full scale war against the kingdom of Neldar.
 So which side do you think will have the privilege of our blades and magic?”
 “We will kill the elves,” Harruq said.

I walked the library in search of the section marked for either of the characters listed on my documents, and was about to give up when I noticed some encased racks in the center of the room.
 I checked the small section, seeing immediately the symbols fit.
 I smiled, thinking how easy it had been as I slid my fingertips across the volumes on that shelf.
 My fingers tingled as they crossed a thin section of pages bound together.
 I slid them out just as I became aware of some sort of commotion… that sounded like it was getting closer.
 No, not a tingle indicating what I was looking for.
 It was a protection spell.
 I ran.
 As I shot through the rooms, all I could think of was not getting caught.
 I shoved the pages under my shirt before I made it through the last door.

He did not hear the screams of pain, the thudding of arrows onto shields, and the angry cries that should have followed.
 Instead, he heard a stunned silence.
 As his shield lowered, his eyes took in a shocking sight.
 A black wall encircled them, translucent at times, but flaring when an arrow struck it.
 The projectiles snapped and broke as if hitting stone.
 The guard captain looked around, seeing his entire army protected.
 “Sergan!” he cried.
 “Yes my lord?” the old man asked.

His face was a portrait of stoic calm, but it was all a lie.
 His heart was troubled and he had not a soul to tell why.
 He held a proclamation of King Vaelor to the entire nation of Neldar.
 He had argued as best he could, but his words meant little.
 When Antonil asked that someone else deliver the proclamation, a frown had crossed the king’s smooth face and he had slammed his lotioned hand against a table.
 “It will mean more coming from you!” the king had shouted.
 “They will know the seriousness of my order.
 I will not be flooded with spies, treated like a mere peasant, and then insulted by such blatant snubbing of my humble call for aid.

The extended silence was almost enough to make me decide he was going to get up and leave.
 "All right, I'll come over and lean against your bed, but you really need to try and sleep.

 "What about you, mister superhero shape shifter?

 I tried not to let my voice get too sing-song, but I felt a completely irrational thrill as he quietly crossed over to my side of the room.

As India’s Freedom Movement worked to awaken the population to the possibility of independence from foreign rule and its Green Revolution worked to awaken farmers to the possibilities of higher productivity, the future lies in awakening each individual in society to his or her own greater human potential.
 Chapter Seven of the Commission’s report examines some of the principal means at our disposal to enhance and accelerate the development of these human capacities.
 It called for efforts to re-examine our development experience over the past few hundred years in order to arrive at a deeper and clearer understanding of the process and principles that govern human evolution, individually and collectively.
 Since the publication of the report in 1994, ICPF’s successor organization, the International Center for Peace and Development, and The Mother’s Service Society in collaboration with the World Academy of Art and Science have worked to formulate a broader theoretical framework for understanding human development.
 Strategies arising from this approach were presented at international conferences co-sponsored with the Gorbachev Foundation in Moscow and with the Noor al Hussein Foundation in Jordan, and were effectively applied to stop hyperinflation in Yugoslavia.
 A full and conscious application of strategies arising from this framework can help to condense the period of transition of East European countries and the take-off of less developed countries from decades into a few years.
 From this perspective, the single most important agent of human development is not the institutions of government or those of private enterprise.
 It is the educational system that imparts to future generations the accumulated knowledge, skill and capacity acquired in the past.
 The quality of that education will determine the quality of the human beings who build our future world.
 Until now, too much emphasis has been placed on transfer of information from teacher to student, too little on the development of thinking and critical faculties by the student.

 Harruq shrugged.
 “You think you know me, but you don’t.

The inner city of Atlanta, Georgia, has been divided into clusters in which members of the local community work closely with the staff of major corporations, voluntary agencies, religious groups and a wide range of government agencies to identify and promote employment opportunities and other poverty-alleviation activities.
 13.Promote organizational innovation: In recent years, large firms have made significant strides in improving their speed, efficiency and flexibility of response to changing market conditions by restructuring operations into independent companies and autonomous profit-centres.
 Small firms need to develop new types of organizations to help them acquire some of the benefits of larger size.
 An innovative experiment has been launched by two dozen small precision-manufacturing, defence contractors in the state of Kansas, with the support of the US Defence Department, to combine their technical, organizational and marketing resources for diversification into non-defence production.
 Initiatives of this type can help strengthen the 12,000 small tool and die-making companies in the United States as well as millions of other small companies in other industries and other countries.
 14.National service organizations: National service programmes can be very successful vehicles for providing training and valuable work experience to youth before they enter the labour market.
 Service in activities designed to improve education, health and the environment can be of immense benefit to the country, while slowing the pace of new entrants to the workforce.
 The United States recently established AmeriCorps to strengthen and expand service and educational opportunities by providing educational grants to youth in exchange for community service in the fields of education, environment, human services and public safety.
 Participants receive a limited wage while serving, plus a post-service educational award for higher education.
 15.Pay the unemployed to work, rather than not work: The high costs of welfare programmes, the negative incentives they provide to job seekers and the harmful psychological consequences of unemployment can be mitigated by modifying welfare programmes to require that the able-bodied unemployed either train or work in exchange for welfare payments.

I mean I didn't come here wanting to learn your story specifically, but there's so much history I don't know.
 There's this shared past that I'm not a part of.
 It's like, oh, I don't know, I think maybe learning about the past will help me understand what's going on right now."
 Mallory's sigh seemed to allude to every one of her presumably substantial years.
 "How very perceptive.
 The past is very much driving what's happening right now, but so much of the past is tied up with the very things from which Alec's trying to protect you."
 I was bubbling with questions, but sensing that now wasn't the time to push, I sat back and waited in silence while she decided exactly how much to tell me.
 "Alec's father was killed nearly two decades ago.
 I don't remember everything about that night, I wasn't even conscious for a large part of the happenings, but the pieces I do remember are sharper than they should be.

 But I ignored the feeling and focused on Seth.

 Not that I needed his permission anyway, it's just Seth never asked for help.
 I, again, suddenly knew the syphon's weakness but I didn't know why or how.
 I could sense some dark black area on the neck just like a target dot.

I spent the next hour mapping out exactly how I was going to salvage my college prospects, and had more or less pulled myself together by the time English ended.
 My newfound dedication to excellence meant I outdid myself in Algebra.
 I finished up the day's homework, and made it more than halfway through one of my makeup assignments by the time Mrs. Campbell stopped off at my desk.
 "Care to run another errand for me, Adriana?"
 I didn't really want to.
 Not when I'd just discovered I had more studying to do than was humanly possible.
 Still, Mrs. Campbell had always been super nice, if equally stern, and there was only ten more minutes of class left.
 Besides, I'd been so intrigued by the sight of Alec drawing that I wanted to see him like that again.
 If he could take such joy in the creation process, maybe he wasn't as bad as he seemed.

“You mean to enter the tournament for the right to knighthood?” asked Doi’van.
 “The tournament is held twenty days after the autumn equinox at the Great Cathedral of Oravue.
 I believe that to be in about ten days and it is about a seven day ride from here,” said Rodregas.
 “You would challenge for knighthood,” said Imeralda quietly.
 “That is not a bad idea, while the Guild will be on the hunt for you, they would not expect you to be in such an event, and you will be surrounded by other warriors.
 They would have no room to suspect you.” “There are a few problems.
 I would need to show proof that I was a squire, which I have,” said Rodregas.
 As he spoke he reached into his pouch and pulled out his old Squire patch.
 He showed them the old beaten cloth, the one memento that he had taken with him from his old life.
 The only problem would be if someone asked too many questions about when and where he had trained.

We're starting a new section, and it should be fairly straightforward for you to pick up."
 I shouldn't have been surprised when she turned out to be right.
 The new chapter was on probability, which had absolutely nothing to do with the stuff they'd been working on the week before.
 I quickly decided I didn't like the new stuff as much as what I'd been studying on my own, but it was relatively easy, and almost before I knew it class had ended and it was time to go to lunch.
 My doubts about whether or not everyone would be back in school today after three nights of partying were quickly resolved as Britney and I tried to fight through the ridiculous foot traffic on our way to our lockers.
 By the time we made it to the lunch room, I was heartily sick of dodging jocks with shoulders the size of an ox.
 Why on earth did every single one of them think it was necessary to mock fight, throw balls back and forth to each other, or otherwise make a spectacle of themselves?
 My mood was further soured as we arrived to find an unmistakable circle of bystanders signaling an impending fight.
 My first instinct was to go find a teacher before the two idiots hurt each other, but while I was still looking around to see if there was an adult in the room, Britney grabbed my arm and pulled me towards the circle.
 It wasn't until we got closer that I realized there was something wrong with the circle of kids surrounding the combatants.

He had always found that a good joke was like a good insult; the best always had enough truth in them to sting.
 Geor smiled, but the others seemed not to have appreciated his little joke.
 The AElf maiden just looked at Rodregas quietly and thoughtfully.
 The Hellborn Orqui smiled, but with a look that said he did it because the other men smiled.
 Rodregas had a feeling that Doi’van lacked much of a sense of humor.
 The other three men simply shook their heads at his idiotic statement.
 Not that his statement did not have a hint of truth to it.
 Rodregas was sure everyone here had lost a loved one, at some point, to an Immortalist.
 But, no Paladin of the Gods had ever come to their rescue.
 The truth was that even if one of the gods was backing Rodregas, it was more likely to be some god who was pissed off at the Immortalists; one looking for a chosen champion for their own selfish reasons.

The first time Ashley and I met I had the pleasure of seeing her naked body, but my goal is not to see it again, my goal is to do this drug deal.
 Her actions highlight that she is seriously addicted and that is not comforting when I am taking her word that Steve is a trustworthy drug dealer, as if there is such a thing.
 Another car approaches and it is white, but I cannot tell the make of the vehicle.
 As it passes, I check it out and see that it is a woman with two small children.
 She is handing a baby bottle towards a car seat in the back.
 A young boy sitting in the front passenger seat stares back at me as if to say, “What are you looking at?” I was once that baby in the backseat and my brother that inquisitive one in the front.
 My father wouldn’t have been in the car either.

The answer was like something you'd expect from a politician.
 It conveyed absolutely no information, and his supreme confidence was infuriating.
 Luckily, I wouldn't have to hold my tongue for very long.
 We were already gliding around the last bend in the road before our lane.
 I expected Alec to slow to a stop and make me walk like James had.
 He slowed, but just enough to make the turn down the dusty lane.
 Rachel jumped out of the car as soon as it slowed down and opened my door for me.
 "Enjoy the rest of your night, and don't lose hope on Les Misérables.
 You never know when you're going to beat the odds."

It seemed too good to be true.
 "Aren't you scared of what will happen when Alec finds out that I know more than I'm supposed to?"
 "And how's he going to find out, youngster?
 From how long it took them to unload my most recent food shipment, he won't be back anytime soon, and I'm certainly not planning on telling him.
 Are you going to let our little cat out of the bag?"
 I started to shake my head, but honesty prevailed before I could finish the motion.
 "I mean I'm not planning on it, but I'm not very good at lying or keeping secrets.
 Especially not from Alec."
 Mallory's chuckle was that of a much younger woman.
 "That bothers you a little, doesn't it?"

The Celestial Lion was simply breathtaking; almost twice as large as the Dire Cats and even more powerfully built.
 It was not simply size that set him apart however.
 It was a way of moving, a grace that spoke of perfection.
 To look at a Celestial Beast made Rodregas wish he could write poetry like some noble in one of the high western courts; it made him struggle for words that he simply did not have.
 And what did this marvelous beast do?
 Rutted, gorged, and fell asleep ready for the slaughter.
 Rodregas could not help but shake his head at how life can show you miracles that made you want to live again, and that using the same miracle drives home the fact that there is truly no justice to existence.
 His eyes jerked back to Ravenhurr, as the sorcerer made a jerking motion, rising up from his sky tube.
 “Now,” he said and quickly repeated in his deep but smooth voice, “NOW!” Captain Poir, the leader of Ravenhurr’s guards, had stepped out of the shadows and approached the prisoners, but Rodregas stepped forward first and grabbed the half AElf maiden’s arm.
 With a quick twist of the key he removed her iron shackles but grabbed her arm hard so she could not run.

I am indebted to Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary General of the United Nations; Dr Federico Mayor, Director General of UNESCO; and Mr James Gustave Speth, Administrator of UNDP, for their support and encouragement.
 A special word of thanks is also due to Mrs Robin La Brie-Jackson, who has helped throughout in managing the work of the Commission with great competence and courtesy.
 Finally, I must acknowledge the inspiration and encouragement provided by Mr T. Natarajan, Secretary, The Mother's Service Society, Pondicherry, India, from the very inception of the idea of the Commission.
 His emphasis on leadership in thought that leads to action has served as a guiding principle for the work of the Commission.
 A more complete list of the many individuals and institutions who have contributed generously of their time and resources to our work is contained in the Acknowledgements appended to this volume.
 During 1994 and 1995, several major international events will take place.
 The International Conference on Population and Development at Cairo in September 1994, the World Summit for Social Development at Copenhagen and the Fourth World Conference on Women at Beijing in 1995, and the designation of 1995 as the International Year for Tolerance all provide unique opportunities for promoting sustainable and equitable development.
 The past 50 years since the birth of the UN have marked striking progress in every field of human endeavour, except in the areas of ecological and human security.
 We should now concentrate on these aspects of security, so vital for sustained human happiness and fulfilment.
 It is our hope that this report will be of some help in accelerating the pace of progress in the evolution of a new human ethic conducive to human beings living in harmony with nature and with each other.

My phone buzzed and I awoke from my trance.
 I thumbed the keypad and opened the message Seth had sent me.
 It read: Whatcha Doing?
 I flipped open the pad and wrote: Walking home.
 I shoved it back in my pocket and continued walking.
 The sun was almost gone and shadows were starting to appear behind everything.
 I looked at my own shadow, that danced behind me.
 The phone buzzed again as Seth sent me a reply.

 Her expression made it clear she considered herself forgiven.
 She turned, facing the direction Chevelle had gone, and left me to my discoveries.
 I expected fury from my father.
 He never failed to disappoint me.
 He saw the child, as he called her, as an opportunity.
 I shouldn’t have been surprised.
 After all, had he not stolen my mother for precisely the same purpose, experimenting with power?

Values form the basis for the tremendous developmental achievements of the past two hundred years, such as the Japanese commitment to teamwork and consensus, the American devotion to enterprise and innovation, the German dedication to quality, and the Dutch commitment to partnership with other people, rather than exploitation.
 Development is retarded by the slow pace at which new values are acquired, which normally requires a change of generation.
 But values can also be consciously transmitted through education in order to abridge the time needed for transition.
 The efforts over the last ten years to implement the value of environmental security illustrate the range of knowledge, information, attitudes, institutions, systems, and skills needed to achieve any high value in life.
 The recommendations presented in this report are intended to form a basis for identifying and providing the values, attitudes, organizations and skills needed to achieve peace and prosperity at the dawn of the third millennium.
 It is well known that societies which are able to harness their cultural energies for development tend to progress very rapidly.
 Yet at the same time, we know that cultural factors can also be a barrier to rapid progress.
 Clinging to the external forms and norms of behaviour which distinguish one culture from another generates resistance to progress, whereas the inner content of culture is a powerful engine for collective achievement.
 Customs are the external form of culture, values are the inner content.
 The customs vary widely, but the values are universal.

Brandon chuckled and reached over to run a finger across my palm.
 "I didn't do anything special.
 Your mom seems like a very sensible person."
 I almost choked.
 "I love my mom, but she's the least sensible person ever.
 She spends half of her time in a different universe entirely, and only occasionally worries about the same kinds of things as other parents."
 "Ah, a dreamer, but one who still freaks out when it comes to her daughter and boys.

Most of all, he wasn’t Billy Graham.
 Besides, I glanced to the right of the kid and saw the babe with auburn curls.
 She stood with hands folded at her waist and creamy white legs quivering below the hem of her flowered sundress.
 Then I knew for certain that if I smiled and she smiled back and I asked her name and number and picked her up later at her churchgoing folks’ house and promised to bring her home by midnight, I would drive to a lookout at the sea cliffs and invite her into the back seat.
 And if she complied, I would do exactly what I would have done yesterday, before I surrendered.
 I might be forgiven, but I felt no less corrupt than before.
 Lucky for her, we lost her in the crowd.
 In the car, Cliff and I didn’t mention surrendering.
 We drove to a party, and told nobody about Billy Graham.
 We stayed in the kitchen, drank a couple beers and talked baseball with a few lonely guys.

 I felt my mouth drop open as his words hit me with almost physical force.
 I wanted to turn and run away, but the quasi-dream from the night before was just barely vivid enough to keep me in the room.
 "Is that what you want?
 Not what's best for me, or what you think is best for me, but what you really want?"
 The silence seemed to stretch into hours before Alec finally shook his head.
 "Good, because I don't want to leave.

ICT can be harnessed to provide farmers with access to state-of-the-art technical advice, quality inputs and market information.
 The proper analysis and replenishment of soil nutrients by itself can double or triple crop yields.
 Utilizing ICT, it is possible to deliver custom-tailored instructions for soil improvement in a timely manner at low cost.
 It can help to promote quality and trade literacy among farm women and men.
 Organizational Linkages: In much of the developing world, agriculture suffers from intense fragmentation of land holdings among small and marginal farmers.
 These farmers tend to have lower levels of education, poor access to technology for upgrading productivity, less access to quality inputs and credit, poor access to storage and processing facilities, and higher losses due to post-harvest crop spoilage.
 Their problems are further aggravated by environmental degradation due to soil erosion, deforestation and depletion of water resources.
 Lack of effective organization and management is a common denominator linking all these deficiencies.
 More effective forms of organizations can eliminate or compensate for these deficiencies to a large extent.
 For example, in India more than 10 million farmers are successfully engaged in sugarcane cultivation, precisely because an established system of contract farming provides them with access to technology, quality inputs, credit and an assured market for their produce.

armers need to be actively engaged in these activities. They need to92m be0m able to produce products that are affordable to thousands of farmers. This is a key to sustainable economic development92m.0m<eop>92m<eod>0m "What is the difference between92m a0m ........92m.0m.....

“Yes,” he said at last.
 “I’ve killed.”
 He eyed Aurelia, desperately wishing to know what she thought yet unable to figure out why he even cared.
 He thought he saw pity in her eyes, perhaps compassion.
 But there was a hardness there, a doubting that made him wonder just how much of him she truly knew.
 “Tell me of the first time,” she said.
 He shook his head.
 “Not today.
 Maybe some other session, if I feel I can.”
 They both stood, Aurelia stepping away while Harruq stretched and popped his back.

“Well, you come up with something to top that and we’ll see how well you do.” “Nah, I’m good,” she said quickly.

 Seriously, was this faery guy crazy or something?

 “I am cooler than you because I hold all the cards.” Then he turned to the army and yelled, “Attack!”

 The monsters surged up the hill, blocking out Kojas’ delirious laughter.

She broke down and I left the house before she had recomposed herself.
 I received my first instructions at the police station.
 Told to follow two undercover cars to the back of a nearby hotel, we were met by about a dozen different police officers in varying attire.
 Some were in marked squad cars but most looked like everything from an ordinary guy to a punk with a beanie on his head.
 Scruffy beards to cleanly shaven, they were an unlikely melting pot of law enforcement.
 They were driving a variety of cars and trucks, old and new.
 It was beginning to get dark and that is what the officers wanted.
 I was instructed by Officer White to stand beside my truck while two officers searched the vehicle and verified that I had no weapon, cash or drugs inside.
 Then I was searched and the officers asked me to remove my shirt so they could wire me up.
 I stood there arms out in this parking lot surrounded by police, as they taped this wire to my body.

Standing next to one of the sinks was a very old, very dirty kitchen drudge slowly peeling a potato.
 She looked up at him in surprise, and with a hint of fear.
 Rodregas raised his hand up in a peaceful motion.
 She probably had nowhere else to go.
 He ignored her and went to the cabinets and the cold box.
 He got out cheese and bread, found some fruit and had a good simple meal.
 He would need to pack as much food as possible for his journey.
 The old kitchen drudge was still peeling the same potato when he left the kitchen.
 Freshly fed and feeling better for it, Rodregas went across the main hall and entered the door opposite the kitchen into the barracks section of the keep.
 The place was about as messy as he had ever seen it; the normal tidiness demanded by Captain Poir had apparently been put aside in excitement over the chance to take some time off for the celebration.

My backpack was slung over my shoulder, filled with my writing books and sketchpads.
 I kept my eyes on the shadowed road, watching my every step.
 Usually I was more aware of my surroundings, but today I was tired and didn’t care if I rammed into a tree.
 I kicked a rock into the grass.
 The sun was starting to set, painting the sky in brilliant oranges and reds.
 It slipped down the sky, allowing the first stars to peek out from behind the bright curtain.
 The remaining light cast shadows over everything, creating the illusion that there was double of everything.
 The world prepared to go into its hours of unreal silence that made it seem magical, and it really was.

"Now why would we do a thing like that when we all know you're a dead man?"
 Dominic stopped just outside of what I was starting to understand was pouncing range for people who happened to have supernatural strength, as Alec gave Brandon a cold smile.
 "If I ever really decide the outcome is a foregone conclusion, you'd better start watching out for your people.
 You'd be surprised just how many of them could disappear if I no longer worried about the consequences of my actions."
 The tingle of Alec's power lessened slightly once we were out of sight, but it still hadn't dropped off completely by the time we were standing in front of Mrs. Tiggs' classroom.
 I could still feel the faintest traces of his power long after he'd finally let my hand go with obvious reluctance and strode off, leaving Dominic and I to find our seats.
 ** The pack was more subdued than normal on the way home.
 Everyone splintered off into smaller component parts as soon as we passed the wrought-iron gate signaling the entrance to the Graves estate.

 Now that she'd finally broached the subject, Britney was unstoppable.

 Everyone refusing to talk about it would've been enough to make it X-Files weird, but when the coroner threw such a fit, it entered a class of its own."
 Britney looked around again to make sure nobody was in hearing range, and then leaned in even closer.
 "He said the wounds weren't made by anything in the cat family.
 He wrote up a whole paper on how the teeth marks were made by some kind of new, previously undiscovered predator."
 The chills were back, and they'd redoubled in intensity.

 For lessons in devoting myself to communion with God, besides contemplating Brother Lawrence, I can turn to Olga.

 Olga Savitsky was a poet.
 We met at a small church charismatic enough so that nobody minded when she stood in the midst of a service and offered her latest poem.
 Long ago, Olga had discovered that what she needed most was God.
 She would hike and pray her way up Cowles Mountain, a mile and a half of rocky trail, then call her best friend Warren so they could pray together, sometimes for hours.
 Then she might go to work, cleaning somebody’s home while listening to worship music.

 Rodregas was surprised to find a pile of equipment outside his door the next morning, and Imeralda sorting through the pile.
 It appeared to be mostly their equipment plus miscellaneous pieces of slaver gear.
 Doi’van stood watching, clearly not sure what to make of it.
 When Rodregas tried to apologize Imeralda ignored him and instead said, “We traded the Immortal Guard equipment for safe harbor here at the village for healing.
 But, of course, there were also regular slaver guards and I claimed their equipment and any money that was in their personal money pouches.” “Your armor got pretty chopped up,” she continued, “and Doi’van did not have any armor to start with.
 I have been trading excess gear and coins to repair armor and to refit some of the other armor to fit Doi’van and yourself.
 We still had our three horses, but none of them were too great to begin with; the two were good for pulling carriages, the other was too old.” “True,” Rodregas said nodding his agreement.

As Ashley reaches for the door, she brings her phone up to her ear as if she has an incoming call.
 She is close enough for me to read her lips, just in front of the truck, her hand pushing the door open.
 “Fuck” is the only word she mouths as her eyes make contact with mine; she is immediately in a panic.
 She looks wildly at me as she turns and runs back into the Starbucks, frantically making her way through the patrons headed towards the back of the shop.
 I have no idea what just happened.
 I sit there dumbfounded, thinking the worst and that we have lost this bust forever.
 Maybe she saw something or the phone call was from her boyfriend who had seen something.

 “Steed, why aren’t they together?” He sighed; I didn’t think he enjoyed discussing his sister’s personal life.

James was standing between Rachel and Brandon, slightly crouched in a posture that looked strangely familiar.
 I heard footsteps to my left as Brandon finished crossing the last few feet between us.
 James backed up a half step, one arm stretched out behind him, pushing Rachel back.
 I suddenly realized why his movements seemed so familiar.
 I'd seen dozens of celebrities being shepherded out of one award show or another by professional bodyguards who acted exactly like James was acting right now.
 Only they usually weren't so obvious about it.
 The only time I'd ever seen a bodyguard physically push their client around was when some up-and-coming soap star had a bottle thrown at her by the wife of someone she was sleeping with.
 I looked past Brandon, expecting to see something threatening headed towards us.

 CM: 	So, it’s ok to say that you had a complete nervous breakdown at this time?
 BG:  	Yeah, sure.
 That’s what it was.
 I found myself with existential nausea, the kind you wake up with in the morning and it’s all over you like an animal and there’s nowhere to go because the beast is you.
 I often backed myself into a corner and curled there like a fetus, as if covering my balls and stomach were protection, as if I feared some attack of a physical nature.
 This is what the fear does to you.
 It’s totally debilitating, man.
 Nausea can unseat you, can defeat the strongest man.

And he agreed to produce, under the name Euphonious Moniker.
 Of course, now, everyone knows he did it, but back then, I don’t know, there were legal complications or something.
 Anyway, with Jim there, well, he gave us the confidence to do it.
 So we started laying down tracks.

Since when did the mayor personally come to deliver a piece of relatively insignificant news?
 Not only that, why would he be so shaken up?
 He'd actually seemed to be trying to determine whether or not it would be okay to just leave a message.
 Like he was operating by a set of rules he didn't completely understand.
 Or maybe at the order of someone else?
 Normally I wouldn't have been brave enough to press, but the words were out of my mouth almost before I realized what I was doing.

“Doing okay?” “Uh-huh.” I decided to take the opportunity; I had a dozen questions since reading the diary.
 “Hey, Ruby, are there any castles around here?” The caravan stopped as everyone turned to stare at me.
 I had no idea what I’d said wrong.
 I must have given away the fact that I had no clue where I was.
 It wasn’t my fault.
 I’d never left the village.
 I didn’t know anything about anything.
 She glanced to the watching eyes and again to me.
 I was sure they were waiting for something.

In spite of the phenomenal growth in global communications, transportation, commerce, finance and tourism, it is still more difficult to carry out most activities internationally than it is domestically, because the international activities are not as well organized.
 For instance, transfer of technology still involves a process that is largely trial and error.
 Firms in developing countries seeking to acquire the best available technology for importation or acquisition have to search at considerable expenditure of time and money to discover what is available within their own country as well as overseas.
 The process of identifying and commercially transferring technology can be vastly simplified and accelerated by the establishment of international technology transfer corporations, sponsored by UN agencies such as UNESCO and UNIDO, specializing in all major fields of technology.
 These corporations should be operated on a commercial, for-profit basis, though governments of developing countries could become shareholders in order to promote their formation.
 Each corporation could undertake a detailed study of available technologies in its field and offer to assist corporate customers in developing countries in selecting the most appropriate technology to meet their needs.
 The corporations could also acquire the rights to important technologies with large-scale applications and then market them widely.

Ruby hung out by Grey and Steed busied himself as Chevelle paced stiffly around the camp.
 I was bored again, with everyone entertaining themselves, so I leaned back against a rock and pulled my pack to my lap.
 I wrapped my cloak loosely around me and positioned my legs so I could place the book there and, hopefully, not be found out.
 I wondered how many more days of traveling we’d have.
 I didn’t see a peak—didn’t even know if we were going to the peak of the mountain we were on—but I was too cowardly to ask, to think about what had happened, so I distracted myself in the journal.
 My sister hasn’t spoken to me since our mother passed.
 I wish she was… different.
 Not merely a different personality, but different altogether.
 I can remember the stories in my mother’s journal about her own sister.

I wondered if it would ever seem real.
 Eventually, I made my way back, wrapping my arms around myself to control the shivers.
 I was surprised and more than a little grateful to find a shelter had already been set up for me.
 The idea of being drenched hadn’t mattered until the cool air cut across the lake.
 Chevelle nodded toward the hut as he prepared a fire, and I found my pack on a bed of birch branches, along with a pile of dry clothes.
 As I tugged off my soaked pants to exchange them for the new ones, I wondered if Chevelle had brought both sets or if they’d been packed by Junnie in that small, strange village.
 I couldn’t fathom why I hadn’t considered he’d so easily be able to follow me when I’d run from there, how I’d been oblivious to the dangers of being caught.
 The shirt was fitted to my shape but of a heavier fabric, and a pair of boots was at the bottom of the stack; it must be much colder in the mountains.
 It reminded me of stepping out of the cold wet gown on the bank of the creek, finding the scroll, the map.
 Chevelle’s words echoed in my mind.

Conditions vary too widely from country to country for detailed recommendations to be broadly applied.
 However, a number of strategies are relevant to the majority of developing countries.
 Some of the components of an Action Plan designed to achieve this goal are given below.
 1.Elimination of agricultural trade barriers by industrial nations.
 The agreements reached for liberalizing agricultural trade in the Uruguay Round of GATT are an important step forward, but they will not release the full dynamism of the agricultural sector, which is so critical for more rapid growth of incomes and employment in both developing and developed countries.
 In the previous chapter, we have called for rapid reduction leading to a complete elimination of agricultural subsidies and other trade barriers by industrial nations, which can generate a positive multiplier effect.
 It has been estimated that complete liberalization of trade in agricultural commodities would yield an annual gain (in 1992 dollars) of about $25 billion for OECD countries and $22 billion for developing and formerly centrally planned countries.
 Actual gains could be very much higher.
 These subsidies cost Western consumers several hundred billion dollars annually.
 In addition, they lead to dumping of surplus sugar, cereal, milk and beef in developing countries, often pushing down the prices which farmers in these countries receive for their produce to far below their production cost.

Neither technological, nor financial nor natural resources pose insurmountable obstacles to achieving dramatically more over the next 15 years than is indicated by past trends or current projections.
 The idea that hunger cannot be conquered because we are running out of land to support rapidly burgeoning populations is contradicted by the facts.
 Globally, there is no correlation between population density and hunger.
 China, with only half as much arable land per capita as India, produces 13 per cent more foodgrains per capita.
 Taiwan and South Korea have only half the farmland per capita of Bangladesh, yet they produce 40 per cent more food per capita.
 Tiny Netherlands, with the highest population density in the world, produces more than sufficient food to feed itself and remain a large net food exporter.
 Currently 11 per cent of the world’s land surface is used for agricultural crops, just 4 per cent more than in 1960.
 A comprehensive theoretical study of soils, climate, vegetation and topography conducted in 1975 indicated that both land and water utilized for agriculture could be doubled, if necessary, and that the earth could support 36 times the 1975 level (18 times the 1990 level) of cereal production using the same share of cultivated land.
 There would be severe practical obstacles to such a vast expansion of croplands, but these findings suggest that physical limitations to food production are not the primary constraints.
 A more commonly accepted estimate indicates that the world’s land and water used for agriculture could more than double.

urrent92m projections0m indicate that the world is growing both land and water very rapidly and that it must therefore92m be0m prepared for this rapid growth.<eop><eod> The following sections will focus on the "92mbig0m picture" of this post.

 We had to sort of sneak it into the house (laughs) but it was old and didn’t sound very good, though I had fun trying to pick out Carter Family or Pete Seeger songs on it.
 Or blues chords.
 And, of course, I had a Mel Bay instructional book.
 I think Dad heard me, saw that I was progressing beyond his wildest dreams and bought me that electric guitar, without asking Mom, without thinking it was her business, you know?
 He saw that I was really good, that I could be something special.

Many of his belongings had obviously come from my defunct store.
 Thomas was dealing drugs on a very large scale and was about to be busted.
 There were a couple of occasions when I was at his home in Sacramento when the cocaine was piled so high on his glass top dining table that you needed to be careful that it did not slide off on the floor.
 Scales were pushed tightly up to the edge of the mound of white rocky powder as if to build a barrier around it.
 Sometimes several people would be working in sync doing everything from cutting the cocaine to increase profits to weighing it and bagging it for sale.
 The cocaine was put in small baggies or tiny glass vials in as little as one gram or scooped into zip lock bags weighing up to one pound.
 The constant consumption of the cocaine by the helpers appeared to be the payment for the effort of assisting in the process.
 People would come and go as they purchased their cocaine all day and all night.
 The big buyers would be treated to a sampling right out of the giant pile.

 Chevelle kept a quick pace and I found myself struggling to keep up.
 Unlike me, he wasn’t dodging between rocks and trees, bending out of sight and watching the ground to keep from breaking twigs while he tried to keep from being spotted.
 I cursed the formal dress I’d been dragging as it snagged on a low-lying thicket, flinging another string of beads into the soft dirt.
 I considered dumping it, but didn’t think it was the best idea to be sneaking around the forest unclothed.
 After crossing a few soggy patches of moss, the hem was damp and darkened.
 I might have ripped some of the excess material off, but Chevelle’s movement wasn’t leaving me time for that.
 Finally, just before nightfall, he approached a small village.
 It didn’t look like more than half a dozen structures scattered against the base of a large hill.
 He dropped the simple pack he’d been carrying beside a tree and hunched down as he slowed his pace.

She smiled as poignantly as though I were her son, and her greatness revealed itself instantly.
 Because I realized that although she earned a Nobel prize and is frequently called a living Saint, she considers herself no better than me.
 Talk about humility.
 The Commandment
 A song reminds me of 1 John 3:23, “This is his commandment, to believe in the name of his son, Jesus, and to love one another as he commanded us.” Again I think about the power of a single word to change us, and redirect our lives, and perhaps give us the ability to change others and the world.
 But I suspect it’s not likely to do so unless we stop and wrestle with its meanings.
 In an essay on writing short stories, Andre Dubus advised that when we get stuck, instead of stopping or attempting to go forward, we should try going deeper.
 On this trip, I have attempted to deepen my understanding of the word “adore.” Now I’m trying to do the same with some words in John’s admonition, because I feel my mind or the Spirit telling me that everything we need to know to live in goodness and beauty may be contained in those few lines.
 John tells us to “believe in” the name of the Son.
 While at a glance this could be taken to mean we should simply believe that Jesus existed, it doesn’t.

The proportion of the labour force in the 20-24 age category that have undergone formal vocational training ranges from a low of 5 per cent in countries such as India and 28 per cent in Mexico to as high as 96 per cent in Korea.
 Vocational training systems need to be substantially strengthened to close the gap, including training for farmers, skilled crafts, self-employment and entrepreneurship.
 Advances in multimedia technology now makes it possible to utilize computers, internet and even television broadcasts to deliver a wide range of educational information and vocational skills that otherwise would be unavailable or very costly to disseminate.
 Upgrading the quality of education and enhancing the skills of the work force will accelerate job creation the world over.
 Distance education provides new opportunities for achieving the goal of education for all within a span of a few years.
 The Challenge and the Opportunity
 The problem of unemployment is of relatively recent origin.
 The very idea of employment as opposed to livelihood is a recent conception born of the Industrial Revolution.
 In principle, every human being born creates at least the potential for his own employment, because his very birth generates demand for additional products and services and because each individual possesses the innate capacity to acquire productive skills and creative knowledge capable of generating new products and services to meet new and existing social needs.
 That is why, in spite of rapid strides in the mechanization of agriculture and mass production in manufacturing, the six-fold multiplication of human population since 1800 has been accompanied by a more or less equivalent growth of employment opportunities.

 I really appreciate you making Cassie back down yesterday.
 Nobody else has ever stood up for me like that.
 At least not people that I didn't already know."
 Based on what I'd seen less than thirty hours ago, it didn't look like her friends stood up for her either.

 He was right, and not only had I wished her to choke, I had been too much a fool to see I had caused it, just as I had caused the speaker to choke.
 I squeezed my eyes closed tight in misery, rolling away from him to curl onto a rock.
 He let me, stepping away to unsaddle the horses and settle onto a seat of his own.
 We were both still until nightfall, when he retrieved a blanket from the pack and laid it over me.
 I didn’t thank him, fearing what would come out if I spoke.
 The next morning was quiet as Chevelle saddled our horses.

So at last she jumped up and ran into the waves.
 Rick woke up slowly with no idea of how long he'd been asleep.
 It had been an exhausting week, and he'd gotten less sleep than usual.
 Of course, he'd had much more fun than usual too, he thought with a lazy smile.
 He turned to see if Marie was asleep.
 She wasn't there!
 Springing to his feet, he looked around.
 The beach had become crowded while he was asleep, and he didn't see her anywhere.

I slipped into a tall tree to watch them.
 To my shock, I found something I had never seen before.
 I watched for hours before I was sure, too stunned to believe it possible.
 I had heard stories, the fairies were always puffing dust about it, but I’d never believed it.
 Was I really watching humans?
 I was pulled from reading, confused.
 Humans weren’t real.

 Man, everything was happening.

“Sorry,” Harruq muttered.
 He shivered as a skull sailed just above them, its screech turning to chaotic laughter.
 The sound raced up and down his spine, triggering fear no matter how irrational.
 Qurrah watched as if immune to the sound.
 He was so much smaller than Harruq, his slender body wrapped in rags, thin flesh clinging to bone.
 Yet he was unafraid.
 Shame and embarrassment burned in Harruq’s cheeks.
 He towered over his brother, his hands beefy and arms muscular.

I didn’t get the joke.
 “You’re serious?” Steed said, humor vanished as he gaped at Chevelle.
 “What, she’s a bright lighter?” Chevelle was across the gap and in his face almost before Steed could stand.
 I jerked back in response, but a screeching siren pierced my ears and I doubled over, covering them.
 It was inside, a screaming, terrible howl coming from my ears.
 I tried to force my eyes open, hoping someone would help me, but they were just standing there, chest to chest, arguing.
 Did they not see me?
 I ached to scream for help, but couldn’t get a sound out, couldn’t breathe.

 Wrestling’s my sport.

 Because you’re as great as anybody.

Even in China, which appears to be a blatant contradiction of this thesis, it was the liberalization of the agricultural sector and greater freedom given to the peasant community that were responsible for the remarkable increase in food production.
 For countries still at an early stage of political development, where government lacks even the force of authority to govern, the first essential steps may necessarily be toward greater centralized authority and control, a common stage in the political evolution of the nation state.
 But that central authority cannot release the full initiative of its farmers or tap the full potentials of agriculture without first instituting broader democratic measures.
 Recent events in Eastern Europe demonstrate that where states attempt to use authority as the lever for agricultural development, the achievements are likely to be limited and short-lived.
 The inability of the authoritarian system to produce enough food for its people was one of the major factors contributing to its downfall.
 Democracy is the most potent fertilizer to ensure food security at the household level.
 ICPF was founded at a time when a consensus was emerging worldwide that drastic steps were needed to wipe out the hunger and famine that were ravaging parts of the developing world and afflicting to a lesser extent poorer sections of the industrial nations.
 Recognizing that the problem of food was inextricably intertwined with the problems of peace, political and social stability, and employment, and that no comprehensive solution to one was possible without substantial progress on the others, it was our hope and intention that this growing consensus on food could be harnessed to accelerate progress on arms control and disarmament.
 Ironically, events have unfolded in the reverse sequence.
 Rapid progress has been made during the intervening years to reduce international tensions, but little has yet been done effectively to address the food issue.

d States, the EU and the international community agree that, as in the Soviet countries92m,0m there is a need for a new,92m coordinated0m approach to address the food problem in a sustained and92m effective0m way. It is crucial that we continue to work92m on0m92m the0m food problem, which has become a global problem.<eop>

We were evasive when we called my wife’s parents to tell them not to come to our house as they usually did.
 We said we had some personal family issues to deal with.
 We could tell their feelings were hurt, but we didn’t feel we had any other choice.
 We did allow my younger brother Harry in on the whole awful situation and invited him to come to the house as planned.
 I needed my younger brother because he had developed a great relationship with my boys.
 He’s 11 years younger than me, and in the music business where he works shooting videos for rap artists my sons listen to.
 He has had a solid relationship with both of our boys and that could translate into communication.
 This Thanksgiving we had an agenda that didn’t include turkey and all the trimmings.

Hopefully they'd quiet down once the actual show started up.
 Judging by the orchestra, it was almost time.
 I looked back, intending to shoot the obnoxious pair a nasty glare in the hopes it would shut them up, and instead caught Alec's eye.
 The house lights were still bright enough for me to make out every detail of his perfect face, and yet I was still baffled by his expression.
 He'd obviously been staring at me, was still staring at me actually, but it wasn't a leer.
 It was something else, it made me want to blush, or maybe smile and toss my hair.
 Whatever it was, it left my skin feeling warmer than usual, and more than a little tight.
 Even after I looked away with a flush of embarrassment, I still felt like I could feel his eyes watching me.
 I could feel his presence behind and to the left of me, like a gentle tingle of electricity I could've pointed to even with my eyes closed.

Economic liberalization offers expanded opportunities for private enterprise to work with small producers in a wide range of agro-industries to combine the social benefits of small holdings with the economies and marketing expertise of corporate management.
 The contract system of agricultural production introduced in backward regions of Thailand has enabled small farmers to work closely with private businesses to produce labour-intensive, value-added crops, with technology, training and marketing provided by the companies, resulting in a rapid rise of farm incomes and job opportunities.
 Developing countries possess significant advantages in terms of climate, year-round production and low labour costs that are conducive to foreign investment.
 With private capital flows on the rise, there is an opportunity for developing countries to upgrade technology and obtain direct access to foreign markets by providing a conducive atmosphere for foreign investments and collaborations in agri-business ventures, such as hybrid seed production, flowers, processed fruit and vegetables, fresh and salt water aquaculture, and sericulture.
 Shift from commodity-based to resource-based planning
 The responsibility of governments to achieve dramatic increases in foodgrain production to keep pace with population growth naturally led to a commodity-based approach to agricultural development in many developing countries.
 Governments projected demand, set production targets for specific crops, and instituted programmes to help farmers produce the food needed to meet the minimum needs of the population.
 But once shortages are eliminated, the focus on specific commodities becomes a barrier to further agricultural development, because it retards diversification into more profitable commercial crops.
 Contrary to free market theory, farmers in many countries have tended to continue production of traditional crops, even when prices have fallen in response to increased supplies.
 There is still a need for government to educate and encourage farmers to adopt resource-based planning, oriented to national and international market potentials and based on principles of economics, employment and ecology.

ltural production in developing countries92m may0m be crucial to sustainable development,92m and0m therefore should be considered a key part of the national economy. Economic liberalization in the agricultural sector has been the driving force behind the substantial92m increase0m in net92m income0m of small farmers. This has contributed significantly to the sharp rise in incomes of92m small0m farmers

Signing my notes with an initial still felt a little like a stroke of brilliance.
 Writing out Adriana was a pain, but for obvious reasons I couldn't use the shortened version of my name.
 I glanced down at my watch and saw it was nearly time for Britney to show up.
 With a sigh I opened up the fridge and pulled out one of the trendy, meal-in-a-bottle drinks Mom had started getting lately.
 I didn't particularly like them, but it would keep until I was actually hungry, and Mom would count the bottles as a way of determining how many meals I was missing.
 I thought about taking a second bottle, but they were too expensive to pour down a sink, and I knew I wouldn't be hungry enough to finish up the first, let alone a second meal.
 The tinny blare of a car horn pulled me out the front door.
 Britney was waiting outside with her heater going full blast.
 I was surprised at how cold it was with the sun still struggling to get above the mountains.
 Of course it wasn't cold enough for me to need a heater, but I also wasn't wearing Britney's shorts, which looked like they were even shorter than the ones she'd worn the day before.

The pent-up demand generated by the destruction of Europe during the Second World War, the rapid expansion of population during the baby boom generation, and the explosion of new technologies in the past few decades, all generated strong internal demand in the OECD countries, resulting in steady economic growth.
 The slow growth of population and productivity in more recent years means that these factors cannot be expected to drive further economic expansion at the same rate.
 In contrast, average growth rates in developing countries are expected to be two to three times higher than in the industrial nations.
 The increase in the dollar output of developing countries was actually bigger than that of the most economically advanced nations in 1992 and 1993, and this trend is expected to continue.
 Measured in terms of purchasing power parity, developing countries now represent more than one-third of the world economy.
 More than 40 per cent of US exports now go to developing countries and two-thirds of the increase in US exports in recent years has gone to these nations.
 The rising expectations and upward mobility of millions of people in developing countries represent a vast potential source of demand, higher incomes and jobs for the West.
 Increasing incomes among the poorest countries has the greatest multiplier effect on global aggregate demand, because even small increments in per capita income can lead to large increases in the number of households with incomes above the threshold for buying consumer goods.
 Asia is expected to generate half the growth in gross world product and world trade during the 1990s.
 This region will have one billion consumers of televisions, refrigerators and motor vehicles by the year 2000 and a rising appetite for both imported consumer and capital goods.

Although the value (in 1992 US dollars) of arms exports fell by more than 50 per cent from 1988 to 1992, it still represents nearly $20 billion annually.
 These weapons, over 80 per cent of which are supplied by the five permanent members of the Security Council, directly contribute to the growing instability and violence.
 During the last decade, 40 per cent of these weapons were sold to trouble spots such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.
 These are, indeed, severe challenges that call for urgent and determined action by the global community on a scale unprecedented during times of peace.
 But the lessons of the past decade should caution us against accepting as a fait accompli statistical projections that predict the outcome of our effort over the next ten years before it has even begun.
 No such determinism exists, except in our minds.
 Given the right leadership, we can change the course, amend the rules, alter the structures and accelerate action to achieve an entirely different and more favourable set of outcomes.

 It is a question of choice.

As Alec had intimated, the day started out with a trip to the office.
 Not just me, not even just me and Alec.
 The entire pack trooped into the room, filling it with impeccably dressed, mostly gorgeous, shape shifters, who gave off a perceptible tingle of energy if you knew what to look for.
 I'd really thought Alec was tilting at windmills right up until he politely, but firmly asked for a brief meeting with the principal and was ushered into the other man's office five seconds later.
 Alec drew the blinds, which didn't do anything to muffle the principal's raised voice.
 Fifteen minutes later, after the unmistakable feeling of Alec's power had crested to the point where it almost felt like there was a breeze blowing from the office, we were all sitting down with the bewildered school counselor and playing musical classes.
 Only it turned out Rachel and I were the only ones not changing our schedules.
 I started to protest being treated differently than everyone else, only to feel my mouth click shut as Rachel shook her head at me.
 It wasn't until Alec was walking me to Biology that I finally got an explanation.

“I don’t know, ambush them back?” “They might see that coming,” she pointed out, “and it’s really obvious.” “Well, they think we won’t do that because that is exactly what they would be expecting, so by actually doing it, we can trick them,” I rambled on and grabbed another strawberry.
 Emily tapped her lip with her pencil and straightened her pink pajamas.
 “I have no clue what you just said Jazell.” I laughed, “What I meant was that we should ambush them.
 Give them a piece of what they did to us.” Emily’s eyes lit up, “You mean use water guns…” “And water balloons…” I added.
 “And a trebuchet to launch the balloons!” Emily scribbled furiously on her paper.
 “I can build one easily.” “Sweet, but when do we do it?
 All four of us hang out every day.” “I can solve that problem.

 I grinned, “This is going to be some fun revenge!” “You can say that again.” “Okay,” I said, “this is going to be some fun revenge.” She wacked me in the head with my pillow, “You’re so weird.” “Well that’s the way I am, deal with it,” I wacked her back with my own pillow.

 Apparently he'd decided against the truth option.

Ruby positioned herself in front of it, watching whatever was outside.
 I sighed.
 Plenty of time.
 I fiddled with the blankets for a few minutes, tried a couple of times—futilely—to move tiny specks of loose rock on the floor, and then gave up and decided to read the journal again.
 I rolled away from Ruby and pulled my pack into the curve of my body, settling the book open but able to be quickly hidden away.
 This morning, I extended my spell, giving Rune an extra day of sleep.
 It was a good thing, too.

Although historically water has often been a source of contention between communities, it has never been the cause of an open inter-state conflict.
 However, nearly one-half of the world’s land surface consists of river basins shared by more than one country and more than 30 nations receive more than one-third of their water from outside their borders.
 Therefore, the danger of confrontation and conflict will escalate unless concerted measures are implemented urgently.
 Water shortages occurring in combination with other sources of tension — such as in the Middle East — will be particularly worrisome.
 Famine remains a persistent threat precisely because the world no longer feels that threat to be severe.
 India’s last major famine occurred in Bengal in 1943 during World War II.
 Although the deficit in food production was only marginal that year, three million died for lack of strong administrative intervention to improve distribution.
 A marginal deficit could work havoc in the absence of an efficient and equitable public distribution network.
 While there is no scarcity of food in the world, there is also not a sufficiently organized effort to promote food security, precisely because the sense of urgency is lacking.
 Abundant opportunities exist to eradicate hunger, but in the absence of a catastrophic event, serious effort is lacking.

I had no idea why the mood had shifted, but I enjoyed the laughter and joking anyway.
 We rode past a waterfall, the roar of water making me curious.
 I figured Ruby was my best bet.
 Chevelle gave me no answers and though hers were sometimes cryptic, I knew she’d been reading books on magic.
 “Ruby, is there a way to harness the power of things… like that waterfall?” Grey glanced at me.
 The look of concern for my intelligence was not exactly uncommon, but it was something I could never quite get used to.
 “Not that I know of,” she said.
 She got her mischievous grin then.
 “Though I did read once that there was a way to steal life force and use it for yourself.” Chevelle shot her a stern rebuke from the front of the pack.
 She continued as if excusing herself, “But it was merely a fairy’s tale and probably not entirely accurate.” Then, in a lower voice, “It is fun to speculate, though.” I wiped at my cheek to clear the dampness from the mist, mirroring her low tone as I questioned her.

His theory maintains that even acts of violence can be justified for certain special people who intend to use the results of violence for the good of all or many.
 The special people, whose brilliance and high intentions exempted them from society's laws, were to me the same supermen Nietzsche urged us to become.
 The novel put me into a fever.
 I read every minute I wasn't washing pots, or smooching with Liz, or so drained from everything I couldn't help fall asleep.
 I even cut off some dates long before Liz's midnight curfew to come home and read.
 My room became Raskolnikov's basement garret.
 If my mom dared enter to bring me a sandwich, I grabbed the plate, shooed her out, shut the door, and usually didn't bother to eat.
 Early in the novel Raskolnikov is in a tavern with a drunk, Marmeledov, whose daughter Sonia has prostituted herself for the money to feed her destitute step-mother and brothers and sisters.
 Marmeledov tells of a dream in which God sets straight the wise men who object to his accepting Sonia into glory: "Here is why, oh you wise, here is why, oh you of understanding—-her sins which are many are forgiven for she has loved much."

 I sighed, “Well, at least we can hang out early.” “Well, while you were arguing with the boys I called home and they said you could come over now.” Emily flashed me one of her million-watt smiles.
 “Great!” I piped.
 “I’ll call home quickly to check with my parents.” I called home and my parents said I could go, which wasn’t much of a surprise.

We will not grow strong if we do not spend much of our childhood in a place that is rich in magic.
 This place feels very good.
 The last few years the only time I was in a place rich in magic, I was also a prisoner.
 It is good not to hunger for magic and be FREE!” Rodregas was, of course, curious about the Hellborn’s background but had been hesitant to ask.
 You do not want to piss off one of the Hellborn.
 Hellborn were not necessarily chaotic and sadistic beings, like actual daemons or Greater Daemons, at least unless they voluntarily chose to become one of Hell’s Chosen.
 Rodregas did not think even one of the Immortalists would choose to mess with one of Hell’s Chosen.
 Hellborn on the mortal world were welcome among the Orqui much like those of Celestial blood were among the humans and the AElves.
 The Orqui mated with Daemons and their offspring became its races noble house, just as the blood of Celestials flowed in the noble houses of Humans and AElves.

The ultimate determinant of the number and quality of jobs in future will not be physical or even financial constraints, but – ‘science, technology, values and social organization – in a word, the human imagination’.
 Trading Jobs
 Those in the West who do not blame rising unemployment on technological advancement, usually blame it on trade.
 Business and economic literature is replete with articles stating that the high-wage industrial nations will suffer rising levels of unemployment due to the growth of imported goods from low-wage developing countries.
 The completion of the Uruguay round of GATT trade negotiations was delayed for years because this view fostered protectionist sentiment in the bastion of free trade Western nations.
 This issue elicits heated emotional debate that often overlooks obvious facts.
 For instance, increasing trade with East Asia and with low-wage developing countries is cited as a major cause of the fall in the wages of unskilled workers in the United States.
 As in the case of technology, there is evidence that free trade destroys jobs in some industries, especially unskilled or low-skilled jobs in high-wage economies.
 In some instances the devastating impact of increasing imports may justify a gradual approach to removing trade barriers.
 However, the overall impact of manufactured exports from developing countries has been vastly exaggerated.

The military have at their disposal scientific and technological resources which in many cases can be applied to environmental protection with the minimum of adaptation, such as information and monitoring systems that track changes in the atmosphere, in the oceans and on earth’s surface.
 These resources can be applied to environmental monitoring and impact assessment, protection of endangered species, quick response to disasters and accidents, energy conservation, and the minimization and management of waste.
 The appropriate role for the military in these various activities will depend on the country, the urgency of the circumstances, and the cost-effectiveness of military involvement compared with available alternatives.
 In some instances, it may be feasible to establish international ‘Earth corps units’, specially trained and equipped to carry out certain types of environmental protection and restoration, such as India’s eco-battalions, which seek to conserve the Himalayan habitat by restoring tree cover and constructing small dams and canals.

 The goals of peace, prosperity and fulfilment for every human being represent formidable challenges – intellectual, attitudinal, organizational and technological.
 We cannot hope to reach such lofty achievements if we waste and squander the precious and abundant resources – mental, psychological, social and material – placed at our disposal.
 A massive reduction in emphasis on weapons production and military establishments, made possible by recent political events and demanded by the pressing unmet needs of people everywhere, represents both a great opportunity and a considerable challenge.
 The opportunity is not only further to reduce the threat of war by reducing the capacity for waging war, but also to redirect and utilize for other purposes the resources now dedicated to war making and prevention.
 The challenge is to do so at a time when rising unemployment and economic stagnation in many countries make further cuts in the size of the military unpopular domestically.

Whatever the reason, I'd gotten three invitations to assorted parties or other activities before school ended.
 I even got another two as I hobbled back from the office with my roses, which had decreased during their stay there by exactly the number of office ladies.
 I'd politely declined each invitation, citing my need to catch up in Biology and Spanish, and made it to tutoring without further mishap.
 Another usher, this one thankfully no more fawning than the first, pointed me towards my seat, and I felt my second surge of disappointment for the night.
 My seat was on the main level, but it was only three rows from the very top, and all the way off to one side.
 I guess it really wasn't that surprising.
 If the school was paying for the tickets I should just be glad I hadn't been stuck with a standing room only spot.
 Still, as disappointing as it was that the performers were only barely going to be visible, it wasn't as bad as the nagging worry that Rachel wasn't coming after all.

Besides, on the occasions that he did the actual dealing, it was always a prime piece of real estate and clients who were rich or famous or both.
 Boston was a terrific place to be a realtor.
 Just after 7:00 Rick drove onto his own little bit of Boston in the Back Bay.
 He'd had his house built on a beautiful acre that was located on the southeast edge of the area inhabited by Boston's elite.
 Real estate prices there were outrageous, but Rick, with his connections and eye for property, had gotten this parcel for next to nothing.
 It was only a few blocks from the downtown area and considered too close for comfort by true members of the upper class.
 But for Rick it was perfect.
 Both his office and his neighbors were close but not too close, and he had a beautiful lawn in the front and a large patio and flower garden in the back.
 Rick smiled as he walked into his kitchen, loosening his tie.
 Lauri moaned every time she walked into the garden.

It was too small to be Doi’van and Rodregas staggered over reaching for him, determined to take one final slaver with him.
 His wounded leg buckled again, and Rodregas tried to reach for the ground to slow his fall, but something was wrong with his arm and it did not move.
 For a split second he saw the ground coming up to hit him in the face.
 And then... darkness.
 CHAPTER 10 THE OTHER KIND OF PAIN
 Rodregas laid there looking at blue swirls for a long time, wondering where he was.
 He was not sure if he was awake; his mind seemed heavy with dreams, and shifting images.
 It took him a long time before he remembered the battle.
 With the memory came concern for Doi’van and Imeralda, and a surge of adrenaline that gave him the energy to try to wake up.
 Rodregas tried to sit up, but his body, which had been so strong since that day at Raven Keep, now only responded sluggishly.

When I finally managed to get the door open and found empty space where there should have been a person, I almost swore.
 Then I saw the incredibly beautiful rose on our porch.
 I picked it up, trimmed the bottom inch or so off with a knife, and got it into some water acting out of nothing more than pure habit.
 Dad had always kept at least a pair of rose bushes alive.
 He'd loved nothing more than giving Mom roses.
 Once I'd safely done my part to help prolong the future life of the gorgeous specimen, I got down to really examining it.
 I was far from an expert on roses, but I'd looked through pictures of hundreds of different kinds of tea roses, and never seen anything quite like this one.
 It was as big as some of the largest specimens I'd seen, and had at least fifty percent more petals than most of the 'very full' varieties I was familiar with.
 That in and of itself was pretty amazing, but nothing in comparison to the petals themselves.
 They were the purest white edged in a breathtaking purple.

Contrary to common conception, services can be a major contributor to job growth even in countries at earlier stages of development.
 This sector is as amenable to stimulation by government policies as agriculture or manufacturing, and it also provides impetus for the growth of other sectors.
 Supportive policies have enabled trade, transport and other services to generate more than 50 per cent of all jobs in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.
 Services have produced more than half of all job growth in many other Asian nations, including private day-care centres, nursery schools and computer training institutes, which are multiplying rapidly in many countries, but can be expanded much further.
 India has adopted an innovative, low-cost, self-employment strategy to expand availability of long-distance telecommunications services by setting up small private telephone and fax centres throughout the country.
 Informal private service enterprises in construction, commerce, food catering, repair and transport have vast growth potential.
 Rapid expansion of education, training and public health, especially rural health and education, can also serve as a conscious strategy for employment generation.
 Technology of organization
 Much emphasis is placed on the widening gap in technology between North and South, but the gap in the technology of organization is even greater.

I shook my head.
 "This is going to be really bad, isn't it?"
 His silence validated my belief, probably even more than he realized.
 "I'd...we'd...spare you it if we could."
 It was my turn to shake my head.
 "No, this is my fault.
 I belong here, not cowering in a corner somewhere."
 Rachel hugged me from one side while Dominic placed a gentle, dark hand on my other shoulder, and then we were off.

Rodregas swung at him and retreated.
 The two shared several blows.
 The third time that he retreated after taking a blow, the guard went for the kill.
 The guard extended his whole body out in a lunge, thrusting his long sword out to its full length.
 The guard saw Rodregas’ braided leather armor and steel sword and thrust with the point.
 The lunge was perfect, the guard went for dead center, and even though Rodregas had been waiting for a similar move, the thrust almost caught him off guard.
 The guard had only one problem, one that he could not have anticipated.
 Rodregas had been taking easy swings, not revealing his true speed.
 Once the guard committed, Rodregas brought both of his swords down and met the lunging blade.
 Rodregas could not meet his sword edge to edge, but it was thrusting out and he caught it and pushed it down and to the left.

When a luckless orc rushed too close to the exit, Qurrah hurled the orb.
 Its explosion conjured shadows and shifting mists of violets and purples.
 The orc collapsed, white smoke rising softly from his tongue.
 In the sudden blinding light, Qurrah laughed.
 “Never,” he said, “could I have imagined it so beautiful.”

 An hour before dawn, the city’s soldiers cornered and killed the last of the orcs.
 The Tun brothers were not there to watch, for they had snuck back to the outer wall at Qurrah’s insistence.
 “I know his plans,” Qurrah whispered as they stared across the open grass and the arrow-pierced orc bodies that covered it.

"It's complicated."
 I'd spent too much time with emotions and thoughts floating around in my own head that I didn't want examined too closely.
 I wasn't about to pry if there was something she didn't want to tell me.
 "I guess that's fair.
 Let me know if you have any more questions."
 Rachel nodded, and then turned back to her book, apparently having used up her store of courage for the afternoon.
 I stopped by Britney's desk to ask if she needed any help, and had to avoid an attempt to suck me into another gripe session about Mrs. Campbell.
 Satisfied that there wasn't anything I needed to be doing to help either of the other girls, and that they'd let me know if that changed, I broke out my Spanish book and reviewed some more vocabulary.
 Despite my growing hatred for Mrs. Tiggs, I managed to get deep enough into my Spanish homework to lose track of time.

Utilizing ICT, it is possible to deliver custom-tailored instructions for soil improvement in a timely manner at low cost.
 It can help to promote quality and trade literacy among farm women and men.
 Organizational Linkages: In much of the developing world, agriculture suffers from intense fragmentation of land holdings among small and marginal farmers.
 These farmers tend to have lower levels of education, poor access to technology for upgrading productivity, less access to quality inputs and credit, poor access to storage and processing facilities, and higher losses due to post-harvest crop spoilage.
 Their problems are further aggravated by environmental degradation due to soil erosion, deforestation and depletion of water resources.
 Lack of effective organization and management is a common denominator linking all these deficiencies.
 More effective forms of organizations can eliminate or compensate for these deficiencies to a large extent.
 For example, in India more than 10 million farmers are successfully engaged in sugarcane cultivation, precisely because an established system of contract farming provides them with access to technology, quality inputs, credit and an assured market for their produce.
 India became the world leader in milk production only because of the power of scale conferred on small producers through the dairy cooperative movement.
 A similar organization is presently lacking for most other crops.

They'd gone easy because today was Ashure Day, and once the dance finished up, he'd be facing off against Brandon, and it would be stupid to tire himself out when he was going to be fighting for his life.
 It was a thought pretty much guaranteed to stifle a conversation, but I managed a smile.
 "Only you would come back dripping in sweat and say you took it easy."
 Alec's smile was a bit strained at the edges, but the tenderness on his face was genuine.
 "I don't know what I'd have done without you these last few weeks."
 My heart went pitter-patter, but still mindful of the fact that throwing myself at him would just result in him freaking out and keeping me at arm's length, I managed not to go all gooey on the outside too.
 Unfortunately the effort meant I was slow responding.

The idiot ran off.
 Seth pushed himself up at a surprising speed and raced off into the woods.
 I did the crazy thing that people like me would do and followed him.
 I looked over my shoulder to see if Emily and Jason were coming but both of them stared at me, baffled.
 Their faces disappeared as I was swallowed by the trees.
 I skidded to a halt and scanned the trees.
 I didn’t see any trace of where Seth could have ran.
 That shows how much I know about asking questions.
 I don’t get the answers and boom; I lose it and become a demanding person.
 I walked more slowly, watching the trees.

Junnie was older than I, but remained striking with the blonde hair, blue eyes, and thin features that seemed to be standard-issue among the village elves.
 The Council had assigned her as my tutor, citing my advanced age as the reason I couldn’t learn with the others, but I suspected it was my stunning lack of ability that had landed me here.
 Junnie brushed a lock of hair aside.
 “There you are, my Fredora!” She was always trying out new nicknames for me.
 It was no secret I despised my given name: Elfreda Georgiana Suzetta Glaforia.
 I decided, not for the first time, my father must have been a drunken imp.
 Not that I could remember him, but I could definitely blame him because the father was always responsible for naming the firstborn.
 It wasn’t as if you could get more unoriginal than using the ancient word meaning “elf”, but he certainly hadn’t needed to follow it with a string of ridiculous, flowery—I stopped mid-thought, realizing my tutor was watching me.
 “Hey, Junnie,” I said, forcing a smile.
 “What’s on the schedule for today?” She smiled in return, straightening the deep blue sash that tied her tunic.

I could hear the sound, but could not make sense of it.
 Nothing made sense.

 Fury and fire swam in my head, my chest, my hands.

 Rachel shrank in on herself a little.
 It almost looked like she was going to cry, which should have made me feel bad, but I was too mad to care.
 I'd been miserable the whole way there, and especially the whole way back, and then she wanted to just pretend like none of it had happened.

I didn't want to risk tripping and making my ankle worse, so I was paying especially close attention to where my feet were going.
 If I hadn't been looking down, I would have completely missed it.
 I still almost thought I'd imagined it, but there was no denying that Vincent's foot snaked out and nudged the ankle of the kid in front of him just hard enough to trip the smaller guy.
 The result was all out of proportion to what I expected.
 The smaller boy fell forward, careening towards the banister with so much force he knocked people in front of him out of the way.
 Just before I left elementary school someone had read us a newspaper article about some poor guy being pushed over a railing and falling to his death.
 I'd had nightmares for months.
 Dreams where the stairs had turned slick and I'd slid all the way down them.
 Dreams where the banister hadn't even been there and the stairs had become impossibly narrow, and nightmares where I'd somehow stumbled and started to fall over the edge of the railing.
 This was like all of those dreams put together, only happening to someone else.

Our very concept of the rights of the individual and the responsibilities of the society must undergo radical change.
 UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has called for a broader definition of human rights to include economic as well as political rights.
 The essential basis for meeting the world’s employment needs is the realization that employment is an absolute necessity for survival in modern society and must be recognized as a fundamental right of every human being.
 Pragmatism as well as idealism compels this step.
 Recognizing the right of every citizen to employment is the essential basis and the most effective strategy for generating the necessary political will to provide jobs for all.
 What is needed is not another job generation programme, but a change in social values that will accelerate the natural and inevitable evolution of society, from one in which labour is regarded as a dispensable resource to one based on full human rights and the enormous productive potential of the human being.
 The type and magnitude of change needed today is comparable to that embodied in President Roosevelt’s New Deal for the American people during the Great Depression, at a time when 25 per cent of the workforce was unemployed: to the Indian government’s decision to launch the Green Revolution in the mid-1960s to achieve self-sufficiency in foodgrains, at a time when the country was highly dependent on imported food to stave off famine: and to Mikhail Gorbachev’s initiatives late in the 1980s to end the Cold War and transform Soviet society.
 Is Full Employment Possible?
 Few will argue with the compelling logic, justice and idealism of this view, but many will question the feasibility of practically implementing it.
 As long as we continue to believe that society is truly helpless to manage job growth, there will be strong resistance to the full employment goal.

Alec's chuckle was muffled by the closed door, but still brought a smile to my face.
 "The biggest difference will be that we're going to have to shuffle some class schedules to make sure Brandon and his pack don't have access to you or Rachel.
 Everything else is just kind of a corollary to that.
 At least one pack member will need to be with you whenever you leave the house."
 I spit out the toothpaste currently prohibiting me from being able to respond, and swung the door open.
 "Alec, it's the middle of the semester.
 We can't just walk into the office and tell them we want to change our schedules.
 It doesn't work that way."
 ** After seeing Vincent's 'accident', and knowing he'd probably been trying to kill or at least seriously injure Ben just for the fun of it, I couldn't really argue with Alec.
 Rachel seemed relatively unfazed by the idea of bodyguards, but I wasn't especially excited about yet another point of difference between me and everyone else.

 I tripped over a dead fellow.
 In the bars, we saw girls get used by both men and farm animals.
 A few times we rode in taxis to motels where prostitutes greeted us.
 We would barter, object to the price, and leave while the coarser of them screeched obscenities.
 Some cabbies, after three or four such stops, stoically delivered us back downtown.

I wanted as far away from all of it as possible.
 But I didn’t make it far.
 Exhaustion caught up with me a few miles later and I found an old oak tree, sliding down its massive trunk to rest my aching legs.
 I’d never run so far in my life and my head throbbed.
 I was seething with anger and frustration and the feeling of being ensnared.
 I didn’t sleep.
 I sat, leaned against the tree, like a petulant child.
 I held a hand up and flipped a flame, tossing it up and down, rolling it above my palm.

I told Eric these beauties would plead for us to steal them away from the rich devil who had enslaved and brought them from China.

 As always when my mind spilled over, Eric stood by me, often wearing a smile that hinted of love.
 Back in North Beach after midnight, a couple of Finochio’s transvestite dancers waylaid us.
 The four of us loitered under streetlamps listening to their pitch about the glories of San Francisco.
 The museums, the opera, the food.
 They were perfect gentlemen.
 On our way home, strung out on fatigue and more coffee, I babbled about how, guided by Kerouac, we had risen above routine, learned to outrun the sheep and phonies and to create our own destiny.

Rodregas paused and the knight signaled him as victor with a finger to the Heavens.
 Rodregas followed this pattern throughout the day.
 He kept using his sword more to block than to attack and kept using his shield offensively.
 This allowed him to take advantage of his unnatural strength to overwhelm his foes.
 According to the contest rules, he could replace his shield after every fourth match if need be.
 By the final match, he was on his third and final shield.
 Most of the rest of the matches were with squires with no ribbons.
 But as the afternoon wrapped up his final match was against Karun who had two second place white ribbons on her arm.

Economic liberalization has unleashed people’s expectations: witness the rush of Chinese peasants to invest in the stock market and the increasing demand of Indian villagers for a range of consumer goods.
 The same movement continues in the West as increased physical and social mobility, the growing demand for higher education and the widespread urge for greater recreation and travel.
 These expectations are the seed and driving force for social progress.
 They provide the energy and create the openness and willingness for change.
 But they also increase the danger of frustration, disappointment and violence.
 The end of the Cold War was expected to usher in an age of peace, but actually violence is on the rise in both developing and developed countries because of the widening gap between human expectations and achievements.
 This growing gap between expectations and achievements is at the root of contemporary turbulence worldwide.
 The popular and some times violent demand for freedom and participatory democracy, the return of religion in politics, surging ethno-nationalism and intolerance, and rising urban crime are disparate expressions of this phenomenon.
 In Eastern Europe, where a peaceful revolution from within has broken the shackles of statism that long confined the energies of people, these energies now surge forward in high and eager expectations of a better life.
 Already there are growing signs of impatience, disappointment and frustration arising from the greater hardships that have come in place of the greater benefits that all expected.

 He headed upstairs to make sure she’d found all the books and articles.
 She was coming out of the office with a load of them.

 “You can use the office.

This is especially true of pregnant females.
 The strongest dire animals are not just those of nearest descent, but also those who come to term in high magical environments.” Rodregas nodded, he had heard bits of this but he had not really thought about it.
 Doi’van stretched his hands up and up to an impressive height, and a smile spread across his face, the first one Rodregas had seen on the Hellborn face.
 It was good to see, though it was also a little scary as his teeth were more pointed than Rodregas was used to seeing.
 His teeth had more in common with the Dire Cats than himself or Imeralda.
 “Of course, I know this first hand as it is the same for us Hellborn.
 We will not grow strong if we do not spend much of our childhood in a place that is rich in magic.
 This place feels very good.
 The last few years the only time I was in a place rich in magic, I was also a prisoner.
 It is good not to hunger for magic and be FREE!” Rodregas was, of course, curious about the Hellborn’s background but had been hesitant to ask.

They hunted with weapons, wrote with their hands, worked as if they took pleasure in it.
 Was there no energy left for magic?
 Or was it not important until you reached the close of your years and realized it was almost gone?
 I remembered how long a thousand years had seemed to me before I planned on spending it in a prison.
 Ruby walked in and I snapped the book shut, positive I shouldn’t have taken it from her table without permission.
 One glance at her stifled reaction and I knew I’d not be able to ask her about what I’d read.
 “Sleep well?” she asked.
 “Oh,” I started, my voice hoarse.
 She handed me a glass of water, which she smoothly traded for the book.

His grip had been rock-hard, but he hadn't actually squeezed enough to hurt me.
 He'd shown pretty good control for someone who'd just been spanked in a debate, and obviously wanted to rip my head off.
 Turning around to return to the tutor room, I almost tripped over my own feet when I saw Britney standing just outside the closed door.
 "Are you crazy?
 First you side with Rachel against Brandon, firmly putting yourself in Alec's camp, and then you turn around and piss off Alec?"
 I really wasn't in the mood to argue with Britney, so I tried for nonchalance.
 "So now I'm not on anyone's side.
 They'll both leave me alone and I'll be fine."
 "Oh, yeah, because that's how things work."
 I'd only thought Britney was mad before.

“Where is everyone?” he asked Doi’van.
 Doi’van did not look up from the ground where he was trying to straighten out a shield without doing more damage and said, “I wondered that myself.
 Apparently most drop out by this point.
 A lot have been injured, especially during yesterday’s sword and shield competition, and many simply quit due to not having any points yet.
 If you are going into the most dangerous part of the competition to be injured or killed and you have only one or two points, why bother?” Doi’van said.
 “To be honest, I am surprised how many are left.
 There are still quite a few young fools out there.” “So how many are left now?” Rodregas asked.
 “Fifty-four, on my last count,” Doi’van said.
 Rodregas was a little worried about his shield and wondered if he should jump in and rescue it from the powerful grip of the Hellborn, but he held his tongue and let Doi’van handle the equipment.
 “I see you are employing the forces of the Infernal Realm to aid you in the joust,” said a voice behind Rodregas.

It was entirely different when you weren't sure you could trust the people around you.
 Brandon was too good to be true.
 I pretty much expected any day now he'd come to his senses and realize he could do a lot better.
 Right or not, it's hard to really become emotionally invested when you feel like that.
 Rachel on the other hand should have been the perfect friend, but I got the feeling she'd always choose her brother over me.
 I felt guilty for holding that against her, family should be important.
 Cindi's friends back in Minnesota had probably felt similarly, but I'd always been really careful not to make her choose between me and them.
 Alec seemed like the type who'd force a decision just because he could.
 I felt my heart go crazy at the same time tears started gathering at the corner of my eyes.
 It was stupid to have risked a panic attack when I was already borderline depressed, but that was what I was looking at now.

So he climbed the bark over to the other branch and then walked on the top, which was very easy.
 He followed Imeralda out on the branch until it started getting thin and began swaying.
 Then he sat on the branch.
 He did not know what to do next.
 His body relaxed when he heard Imeralda’s voice.
 “Are you trying to kill me?” she asked, “and are you really trying to rescue a Forest Nymph from a tree?” The laughter that followed was pure and open and even he had to laugh with it.
 “So,” he asked, “what are you doing?” “Well, I decided that if this was a greater sigil I should touch it.
 Even though I do not want a greater sigil to consume my magic, this is the One Tree.

 She took the handkerchief he'd just pulled from his pocket, wiping her face.

 If-if I were to keep this beautiful ring, the first thing I'd want to do would be to run to my mother and tell her all about it.

Most of the nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia have achieved a significant measure of political and economic stability combined with unexpectedly high growth rates ranging from 5 to 10 per cent.
 This region has emerged as an important source of trade and economic growth for the industrial nations.
 Global expenditure on education and training as a percentage of GDP has doubled during the decade.
 One remarkable result has been the complete eradication of illiteracy and universal enrolment in primary education.
 Scientists report that the ozone layer is being restored to pre-1970 levels far more rapidly than had been anticipated.
 This has been aided by a worldwide rush to renewable energy power generation led by such regions as California, which now produces 10,000 megawatts of electricity from wind power and has mandated an increase in pollution-free motor vehicles from the present level of 5 per cent to 25 per cent by 2010.
 Common sense tells us it is not possible simply to wish away the serious problems barring these achievements.
 We need the technology vastly to improve productivity in poor countries.
 We need the organizational know-how to create effective administrative and political systems in transition states and to restructure international institutions.
 We require enormous investments in constructive economic activities – as opposed to lavish arms spending – to generate jobs and higher incomes for hundreds of millions of people in the developing world, and by extension to stimulate further economic growth and job creation in the West.

When I knocked on the door of the hotel room, my father opened the door looked at me, called me Thomas, and then he looked at Bill and called him by my name.
 He didn’t even know what his own kids looked like.
 We spent a brief time in the hotel room getting our names and heritage correct then we were off to dinner.
 During the dinner, Richard asked if I could “score some toot” which I discovered meant find cocaine.
 Well, I didn’t need to look much past my pocket to score, so we ended up getting drunk and snorting toot to commemorate our father and son reunion.
 At the time, it seemed like, “Wow, my dad is cool,” but I later realized how sick it all truly was.
 The fact is, this man was never a father or a dad or anything to me.
 Richard basically knocked my mother up in high school, married her, had another son and abandoned her and his sons while they were still babies.
 He never paid my mother a dime in child support.
 My mother tried to warn me when I decided I wanted to meet him, but as only time would tell, trying to tell your teenage son anything is a virtual impossibility.

It would have been difficult to conceive in 1970 that, in spite of the myriad technological difficulties and powerful economic interests at stake, the entire world would make such a dramatic shift of attitude so quickly.
 This change was not brought about from above by enlightened leadership, but rather from below in response to a swelling tide of public awareness and concern, growing as a result of the work of countless individuals, voluntary agencies and research institutions projected through the media, confirmed by the findings of the UN World Commission on Environment and Development, embodied in the specific resolutions of the Earth Summit and in the growing body of environmental laws being adopted by every country, and now commonly incorporated in the educational curricula at every level.
 The changes called for in this report require changes of attitude of this magnitude.
 But no longer is it necessary for a great visionary leader to espouse a new attitude.
 The higher general levels of public education, the worldwide extension of the media and the active initiative of literally thousands of institutions serving the public interest can exert a powerful force for change, which sooner or later political leaders will accept and espouse.
 What is the shift in attitudes demanded to achieve global peace and prosperity?
 From a competitive, egocentric, state-centred attitude toward national security, that seeks to enhance security for some nations at the expense of the rest of the world, to an attitude of true global cooperation for collective human security.
 From demanding that other nations grant democratic rights to their people to a willingness to extend democratic principles to the governance of international institutions.
 From preoccupation with problems and limitations to an appreciation of the opportunities for more rapid development.
 From wanting to meet people’s minimum needs to wanting to help them realize their maximum potentials.

One afternoon while I was at work, Lisa was trying to help Brandon out by organizing some of his bills.
 Brandon told her that he needed to run a quick errand.
 She called me later that day and said she had lost track of him and he wasn’t returning her calls or answering his phone.
 All the usual horrible thoughts began to surface in our minds.
 The day turned into night and we still hadn’t heard from him.
 Close to midnight, as Lisa and I watched a movie together in the dark, there was a loud banging at our back sliding glass door.
 Our dogs went crazy—they were as startled as we were.
 Who the fuck was at our back door?
 It was Brandon’s druggie friend, high as a kite, rambling a mile a minute.

After the millions of thoughts and moments that have haunted me during this evening I begin to focus on my current life, not my past.
 I think of my wife who has been left in silence for nearly four hours.
 I think of my sons, Brandon completely fucked up from his drug addiction and Bryce away at college completely unaware of what is happening and what risk his dad is about to take.
 It occurs to me that Bryce and my wife may never forgive Brandon if something were to happen to me.
 I recall their little league baseball games and soccer teams I coached.
 All of the art projects which we proudly displayed with the help of refrigerator magnets over the years.
 Particular events in their life pop in and out of my head.
 Their future begins to enter my mind and I hope and pray that I will see Brandon free from his addiction one day and see Bryce graduate college.
 Who will they marry one day, how many children will they have, will I be a grandpa or a memory?
 Too many thoughts are packed in my head as I realize this is my life and my family’s life passing before me as the moment of truth approaches.

 He was clearly a man that liked to think before he spoke.
 “I am simply using you as bait.
 When they come for you, I will kill them.
 Fighting together we will kill some of their vaulted Immortal Guards.” As Doi’van finished he gave a low growl and shook his horned head, his thick mane of wild jet black hair was almost as distinctive as Imeralda’s own auburn flowing locks.
 But with Doi’van the gesture spoke of defiance and challenge like some great bull lowing his horns and getting ready to charge.

Recommendations to Achieve Full Employment in Industrial Nations
 Earlier we noted long-term trends that suggest the recent rise in unemployment in the West does not necessarily forebode, and need not necessarily result in, chronically higher rates of unemployment in these countries.
 Granted that the necessary political and social commitment is forthcoming, there are a range of strategies which, taken in the proper measure and combination, can dramatically accelerate job growth and reduce unemployment.
 Each of these strategies has proved effective in stimulating employment, though none by itself may be sufficient to solve the problem.
 A comprehensive, total approach, rather than partial and half-way measures, is needed.
 No industrial country can claim that it systematically exploits all the potential benefits of the strategies in this list.
 This should be the highest priority of every Western government today.
 1.Promote small businesses: All the publicity given to the impact of down-sizing by major corporations has obscured the fact that the top 500 US firms employ less than five per cent of the US workforce.
 It is also the smaller firms that are responsible for job growth.
 Businesses employing fewer than 20 workers presently account for 57 per cent of new job creation in Europe.

James was standing between Rachel and Brandon, slightly crouched in a posture that looked strangely familiar.
 I heard footsteps to my left as Brandon finished crossing the last few feet between us.
 James backed up a half step, one arm stretched out behind him, pushing Rachel back.
 I suddenly realized why his movements seemed so familiar.
 I'd seen dozens of celebrities being shepherded out of one award show or another by professional bodyguards who acted exactly like James was acting right now.
 Only they usually weren't so obvious about it.
 The only time I'd ever seen a bodyguard physically push their client around was when some up-and-coming soap star had a bottle thrown at her by the wife of someone she was sleeping with.
 I looked past Brandon, expecting to see something threatening headed towards us.
 I even opened my mouth to warn Brandon, but there wasn't anything there, just Brandon, still with the same casual smile as he reached out and squeezed my arm.

Either way you should be physically more powerful.
 It is the nature of the competitions that I am worried about.” Doi’van paused as he ordered the coming conversation in his mind.
 Rodregas knew him well enough to wait until he was ready.
 Rodregas had been surprised when Doi’van had refused to take back his oath when they had had some privacy.
 Doi’van had simply said he took his oaths too seriously to play such games.
 So Rodregas had sworn the same oath to Doi’van, which Doi’van had accepted.
 Doi’van though was more focused on the task than the oath.
 He stated, “Each competition is worth points.
 The top five winners of each round of competition earns five points; those that place six through ten earn four points, eleven through fifteen earn three points and so on.
 There are a total of five different events.” Rodregas nodded.

Quite understandably, decades of totalitarian government had generated such powerful resentment against strong government that by way of re action the society sought for solutions which did not require government to take a highly visible, leading role.
 The reform programme was based on the implicit assumption that the market is a self-regulating mechanism which can substitute for regulation by government.
 This notion is contradicted by the experience and practice of every major market economy in the world.
 Government plays a critically important role in defining and protecting property rights, ensuring competitive conditions, controlling monopolies, regulating foreign trade, establishing and enforcing quality standards, safeguarding the rights of investors and consumers, preserving the environment from over-exploitation and pollution, encouraging investment, and upholding the rights of employees to minimum wages, safe working conditions and social security in the case of lay-offs.
 The policies that have made possible the most successful recent development initiatives of nations around the world, especially in Japan and the newly industrialized nations of the Pacific Rim, do not support the argument for unregulated free market forces.
 These countries combined freedom for entrepreneurial initiative, private property and market prices with care fully crafted industrial policies and tightly controlled foreign trade and investment practices to nurture and protect nascent industries and restrict foreign investment.
 At the same time, they organized the importation of foreign technology on a massive scale.
 They utilized import tariffs, export incentives, tax relief and other mechanisms to guide development of their domestic economies.
 The reform programme involved the dismantling of most of the administrative mechanisms by which an economy can be monitored and controlled by government.
 In place of free market conditions, organized crime and corruption became rampant.

He watched the raging warrior butcher friend after friend, so many having never seen their eighteenth winter.
 Harruq tore a neck open, punctured the same man three times, and then gutted another who had closed the distance.
 The man died after his final slash passed an inch from the half-orc’s skin.
 “Come on,” Jeremiah said to himself.
 “Hang it all, come on!”
 The half-orc held both swords out wide and roared at the remaining three facing him.
 When they held their ground, Jeremiah could bear the sight no more.
 He charged, screaming the cry of one expecting to die.
 He did not get far though, for a sharp burning pain enveloped his wrist.
 His arm jerked back, and the sudden force spun him to his knees.

but she was still in 2011.
 She took a minute to get her bearings and then wandered back toward Rick’s house.
 He was perched on the edge of a chair and sprang to his feet when he saw her.
 “Are you all right, sweetheart?” he asked, taking her hand.
 “Yes.” “I’m sorry you didn’t get home.” Tears filled her eyes.
 “I tried so hard.
 I have on all my 1927 clothes, and I didn’t think about anything but what’s going on at home.” “I’m sorry, sweetheart.”  He led her into the kitchen.

She told everyone how her mother told her how ugly she was her whole life and told her she was worthless, how she attempted to numb the pain with the drugs she took.
 How she became addicted to the drugs, and prostituted herself to pay for her habit.
 She said that she took all the drugs she could because she knew she would never be alive to see her twenty-first birthday.
 She smiled and announced that she was now twenty-one.
 She thanked one staff member after another and one student after another, each for something specific they had contributed to her healing.
 She said she now felt worthwhile, beautiful and confident.
 She had learned how to manage the demons in her head.
 She was beautiful and it shocked me that she had ever considered anything else and to the point that she tried to destroy herself.

But it didn’t clear my head.
 I still couldn’t understand.
 A painful fear shot through me, and I tilted my head forward to run through the growth.
 Vines, thorns and leaves turned to muddy ash as they touched my outstretched arms, wet with rain.
 When I reached the edge of the onetime garden, I stopped to kneel, digging my fingers deep into the soil to form a trench.
 When I saw the bared roots, black and rotted, I was suddenly exhausted.
 It was too much.
 It took me to that familiar, mindless place, and I turned to walk toward home, void of any sensation save the slow rain on my skin.
 When I entered the house, Fannie was there, but I only trudged past her on the way to my room.
 I barely took notice of her expression, her tight grin and suspicious eyes as she took in my mud-streaked clothes, dripping hair.

But I can spell my name now!”
 “Good for you,” Aurelia laughed.
 “Now go on home, you bother me.”
 “Well fine then,” the half-orc said, feigning insult.
 “I see someone’s jealous I saw it before she did.”
 Harruq dodged the first two springs of water but the third one caught him square in the face.
 He was still dripping when he arrived home.
 “You and her go swimming?” Qurrah asked him.
 “Shut up,” was all he said.

“Where are we?” he asked.

 Harruq glanced around, unable to see the town in the distance.
 “So that’s how you always showed up behind me,” he said as he got to his feet.
 “That magic…‌blue thingie?”
 “That magic blue thingie is a portal,” Aurelia said, her arms crossed over her chest as she held her elbows.
 “And yes, that is how I did it.”
 Harruq shrugged, glancing about as he tried to get his bearings.
 A thought hit him, harder than any whacks of Aurelia’s staff.
 “Qurrah!” he gasped.

One swung his sword in a high, round arc while the other stabbed forward, hoping to gut the half-orc because of his charge.
 Harruq’s charge, though, was far from mindless.
 His speed far beyond the guard’s, he knocked the stab away, then shifted his weight so that both Salvation and Condemnation blocked the other attack.
 The weaker blade shattered against the magic of the twin swords.
 One weaponless and the other horribly positioned, the two were defenseless.
 Salvation took a throat.
 Condemnation pierced rib and lung.
 Harruq ripped his blade out of the guard’s chest and shoved the body to the side.
 The dying heap of flesh collided against two other men, knocking them back and delaying their attack.
 He mocked them, adrenaline flooding his veins.

But anywhere else."
 She stirred her tea thoughtfully.
 "And it's accepted?

 "We don't have speakeasies like those in the '20s, but if you want to, I'll take you dancing one night.

 They spent the next hour comparing their respective decades.

 I didn’t even have control over that.
 Chevelle stepped down and started a fire.
 When he walked away, I recalled what he had said earlier in the day, that you could stop someone’s heart.
 It hadn’t occurred to me that might be how he killed his prey.
 He made his way back over the scrubby brush, two small rabbits in hand.
 He dropped them and a branch covered in fat, blood-red berries by the fire, and I posted myself on the edge of an uneven rock to watch.

“Rough night?” Aurelia asked.
 She blinked as a tingle in her head insisted that something was different about the half-orc.
 After a few seconds, she saw it.
 “Harruq,” she asked, “is it me, or did you grow thirty pounds of muscle overnight?”
 “Yup,” Harruq muttered.
 “I’m magical like that.”
 The elf glared at him.
 “Sorry,” he said, his face reddening.
 “I had a long night.”
 Aurelia nodded.

Then, no matter how valiant the efforts of healer Durien, he barely kept you two from death’s door.” “So what did I do?” she asked them.
 “I nearly ran myself to exhaustion fetching Jordaan to heal you.
 I was using my own relationship to rescue you, who I have known less than a season.
 And now that all this effort has been done you are going to get mad… mad at the only reason you two are alive to complain at all?
 Well to the Infernal with you.”  With that Imeralda turned and jumped back into the trees.
 The half Nymph’s anger, though not meant to cool the warriors, had that effect as both men stood in shock at Imeralda’s normally calm demeanor.
 Doi’van wilted like a flower without water in the sun; he literally sat down on the ground.
 Rodregas simply sagged as the truth behind the half AElf’s words sank in.
 Jordaan simply stood watching the scene, without his normal expression of cheer.
 Finally Rodregas turned to Jordaan and said, “Imeralda is right and I apologize for our anger.

When one looked at him and how powerfully built he was, it was incredible to imagine what he could do on the battlefield with a greater sigil added to his power.
 He would be a true daemon on the battlefield.
 But while Doi’van loved his strength, he also loved his intelligence.
 In comparison, Rodregas was less interested in exploring learning as he was about what he could do as a warrior and carrying out his duty.
 “Well,” Rodregas said, “I don’t think we are going to have any options for sigils for now.
 Let us continue to learn what we can of battle and of magic.
 If we are lucky we can worry about more if we survive our first strike at the Immortalists.” The next morning, during his meditation, Rodregas realized that it was time for action.
 He realized that if they continued simply to hide out in the farmhouse, winter would come and travel would be much more difficult.
 As he knelt on the ground examining the new color of the trees, he knew that it was now time to strike.

“Get back,” Harruq ordered as he shoved Qurrah to one side.
 He slammed himself against a house, barely dodging a downward chop of the blades.
 The orc attacked again, all his strength behind the swing.
 Harruq ducked, narrowly avoiding decapitation.
 Qurrah lunged before the orc could strike again, latching onto his wrist and letting dark magic flow.
 The orc howled at the sensation of a hundred scorpions stinging his flesh.
 Flooded with adrenaline, he hurled Qurrah aside, desperate to break the contact between them.
 Qurrah’s thin body crumpled against the dirt.
 At the sight of it, Harruq felt his rage break loose.
 He slammed his fist into the orc’s stomach, followed by a brutal kick to the groin.

 I didn't even want to guess at how much weight was in each basket, but as Alec cleared the door it was obvious that the slow speed that he'd been moving at had only been due to him not wanting to hit anything.
 He moved like they weighed no more than a couple of pillows as he crossed the cabin and set them down in front of what must be the food pantry.
 "That was almost as quick as normal."
 Alec nodded in response to Mallory's observation.
 "I've been lifting weights for a while, but present circumstances dictated a more aggressive program."
 He opened the door to the pantry, and started putting cans away, but Mallory waved him off.

And perhaps I’m light years from devoting myself to communion with God.
 Even on lesser matters than Zoë, such as writing books and building the Perelandra College writing programs (another of my obsessions), I hesitate to cut back in order to devote more time to communing with God.
 Even during these meditative times on the road, since Pismo Beach I have devoted as much to thoughts of the book that will come of the journey as to whether it all will help me live more like Brother Lawrence.
 I wonder, if I were given the choice between writing a wonderful book or achieving deeper communion, which would I choose?
 The woman I call Sweet still haunts me.
 I imagine if some good Christian folks would suggest that God might have sent her to me, others would assure me she was in the devil’s employ.
 Whether she came from God, the devil, or by pure coincidence is academic to me.
 If instead of her, Father Abraham would’ve appeared and reminded me that he was willing to not only surrender his son but to impale and burn his own child, I wouldn’t for a moment consider following his lead, even as far as the give her up part.
 These days, with my big kids and Pam off in the world on their own, Zoë is my only real treasure.

 He couldn't bear the images that had come on the heels of his newest realization--images of Marie surrounded by children, making dinner for them, for a husband, kissing him, making love with him .

 He wished he could stop thinking.

Namely the fact that tomorrow I would have to go enroll in school and try to blend in with a bunch of small-town juniors who'd all probably known each other since they could walk.
 Going to a new school after missing the first month of classes was a prospect likely to generate anxiety in the most outgoing of teenagers, and I was far from that, but it was a different kind of worry.
 As I mapped out all of the things that could, and probably would, go wrong, I could feel my heart slowly settle back down out of my throat.
 If I were pretty or athletic I'd probably manage to fit right in.
 It always seemed like the kids who moved in partway through the year usually had some kind of instant in with the cool crowd, but that probably wouldn't happen for me.
 It wasn't that I didn't want to make friends; I just wasn't very good at it.
 My equilibrium seemed to have returned, so I took a few unsteady steps around to the back of the truck.
 If I didn't return with a box soon Mom would rush out expecting the worst.
 Unless she got caught up visualizing some new project, in which case it would be hours before she thought to come check on me.
 We'd moved the beds and most of the other heavy items in earlier, which helped explain my exhaustion, but that didn't make the pile of remaining items in the back of the truck any less foreboding.

 He wanted sympathy, but he knew that the straight talking Doi’van was not likely to give him any.

 It might also cause less confusion if you are able to gain both Infernal and Celestial great sigils to have ones that share some similarities.” Rodregas nodded and walked toward where Doi’van had pointed, having to circle around what appeared to be a bear with the front feet of a stork and the over large head of an owl.
 Rodregas felt his skin crawl and he almost left the chamber, but then the cat shape behind the daemon became clear.
 The Daemonic shape seemed to be missing the odd combinations of the others.
 It looked like the large Panthers he had heard of that were found in the southern jungles.
 It had no mane like the lions he knew and its fur was black.
 In fact it was the darkest black he had ever seen.
 This was why, at first, he had not seen the shape in the dark.
 It seemed to soak in and blend in with the night.

Slowly the black magic seeped out of her, the pain faded, and then she sucked the dusty air into her lungs.
 “You are a powerful sorceress,” Velixar said, his anger gone as quickly as it had arrived.
 “But I have fought the founders of the Council of Mages.
 I have killed men who thought themselves gods.
 I have died but once, to Ashhur himself.
 There is no shame in your defeat.”
 Aurelia struggled to her feet.
 The well of magic inside her was dry.
 In time, her strength would return, but she doubted the necromancer would give her a day to rest.
 She used a bit of the magic she did have left to summon her staff.

 She turned to go upstairs.

I thought I’d picked out Anvil’s deep voice.
 “Trapped here like rats… cowards…” He was outraged.
 Someone else, Grey maybe, worry coloring his tone.
 “We can’t just leave them out there.” I knew Chevelle’s voice, interlaced between the other comments.
 “She’s not ready… we can’t… too soon.” And a voice I couldn’t place.
 “… another setback…” They seemed to be in disagreement but I couldn’t find the interest to stay with them.
 I faded back into sleep.
 These dreams took me farther.
 My sight was off, not as clear, distorted.

I was just over-reacting.
 It'll turn out to be nothing."
 It was just like Mom to misplace something important like that.
 I opened my mouth to agree with her, but stopped before the words could fully form.
 I didn't know much, but fraud wasn't the kind of thing you associated with a slap on the wrist.
 If the worst happened and Mom was going to serve jail time then we had bigger problems than even what she was admitting to.
 ** It looked like the sun must have set hours ago, but it wasn't really dark.
 The full moon seemed oddly brighter than normal, edging the landscape with a silvery tracing.
 The cool illumination was strangely complemented by the warm tendrils of light trying to escape from the greenery surrounding the area.
 I let my gaze drop, and found an unearthly pool of liquid light at my feet.

Regional and tribal politics have flourished.
 Dozens of civil and inter-state wars have been fought, accounting for millions of lost lives.
 Food production and employment have lagged far behind population growth.
 In the absence of legal channels of protest, opposition parties have frequently resorted to violence.
 By the end of the 1980s the lack of material progress and the emergence of young educated professionals in leadership positions had fostered, on the one hand, a revolt against single-party rule and, on the other, popular pressure for multi-party democracy that have together resulted in a democratic domino effect, similar to the spread of communist rule which Western democracies had feared would overwhelm South Asia twenty years ago.
 As recently as 1989, only four African countries could be considered stable democracies and three more were moving in that direction.
 Only three years later, 18 African nations could be classified as democratic and a number of others were in the midst of far-reaching political change.
 The peaceful end of apartheid in South Africa is one remarkable outcome of this process.
 There are even winds of change in the Middle East, where Jordan has recently shown the way by conducting free elections.
 The role of democracy in development would be even more compelling were it not for the apparently contradictory evidence posed by the recent experience of Russia and China.

To an exotic beauty like her a balding overweight man like himself would be invisible under normal circumstances.
 Some of the other guards might be tempted to take what would not be given, but not him.
 Like his mother always told him, a person did not have to own a beautiful sunset to enjoy watching it.
 The door to the top of Raven Tower was large and deeply carved in intricate designs and runes.
 Though as a youth Rodregas had trained in the basics of magic, a secret he was careful not to share, the magical runes were far beyond his understanding.
 He led the prisoners through the door and walked out onto the top of the tower.
 The circular roof was flat and open to the sky.
 The only covering was the landing for the stairs in the East corner.
 The cool night air refreshed his spirits somewhat.
 Before the prisoners could look around, he shoved them to the right side and strode over to Ravenhurr, who was peering into the night sky through a long tube with tiny glass panes at each end.

“Can you help Emily, she's trying to release the trapped dragon,” I whispered to him.
 Jason nodded.
 “Will do Jazell.” He stood up and walked over to Emily.
 I sat on the ground next to Seth.
 His eyes were closed and he looked dead.
 His blue hair was ruffled up in all directions.
 I was so sure that he might be dead that I placed a hand on his chest, feeling for a heartbeat.
 I felt the steady thump under my fingers and I sighed in relief.

 She leaned over to feel his forehead.
 "Hmmm.
 You may have a slight fever.

 He watched her go.
 She was so sweet and loving.
 When she returned, he took the aspirin and drank the juice, obeying when she insisted that he lie down on the sofa so that she could bathe his face with cool water.
 Marie patted his forehead with the washcloth, dipped it into the bowl of water, wrung it out, and then patted his forehead again.

Authoritarian government is frequently either the result or the cause of food shortages – its use of force justified on the one hand to meet a crisis situation or necessitated on the other to restore order and initiate emergency measures.
 Only under democracy is government compelled to pay attention to the needs of people at the lowest levels of society.
 The dual pressures of a free press and electoral system have helped a free and democratic India to avoid famine for nearly 50 years, despite the recurring incidence of widespread famine in previous centuries, up to as recently as four years before the country gained independence.
 Even in China, which appears to be a blatant contradiction of this thesis, it was the liberalization of the agricultural sector and greater freedom given to the peasant community that were responsible for the remarkable increase in food production.
 For countries still at an early stage of political development, where government lacks even the force of authority to govern, the first essential steps may necessarily be toward greater centralized authority and control, a common stage in the political evolution of the nation state.
 But that central authority cannot release the full initiative of its farmers or tap the full potentials of agriculture without first instituting broader democratic measures.
 Recent events in Eastern Europe demonstrate that where states attempt to use authority as the lever for agricultural development, the achievements are likely to be limited and short-lived.
 The inability of the authoritarian system to produce enough food for its people was one of the major factors contributing to its downfall.
 Democracy is the most potent fertilizer to ensure food security at the household level.
 ICPF was founded at a time when a consensus was emerging worldwide that drastic steps were needed to wipe out the hunger and famine that were ravaging parts of the developing world and afflicting to a lesser extent poorer sections of the industrial nations.

It was like walking into a palace, complete with painted, spun-sugar clouds, and burgundy drapes made out of rich velvet.
 If it wasn't for the press of people pushing me from behind, I probably would've stayed in the front entryway right up until the sound of the orchestra filtered down to me.
 As it was, I only got a few hurried looks before being rushed along with the rest of the students.
 Seeing all of my classmates looking utterly bored as they allowed themselves to be herded through the most amazing building I'd ever seen brought me back to my original train of thought.
 I hadn't actually spent every waking moment thinking about Les Misérables.
 A fair number of those seconds had been spent with Brandon.
 He'd already been picking me up from school every morning and dropping me off most days.
 We now spent every lunch together, and he'd started lingering when he dropped me off.
 It was still only on the days when Mom wasn't home, and I hadn't quite mustered the guts to invite him in, but it'd still been really nice.
 Of course it'd been the logical kind of thing to have start happening after someone asked you to the Ashure Day Dance.

Where both Imeralda and Doi’van had nailed the dead tree in the exact center, his arrow was closer to the barn then the target.
 Unfortunately, the barn was in the opposite direction.
 Rodregas heard a few unkind chuckles from the other two at his shot.
 “I don’t understand it,” he said.
 “Why do I have so much trouble controlling my magical power now?
 I know I have a lot more power, but you both have lots of power as well, yet I can’t seem to control it.” The frustration in his own voice was clear.
 “Could you feel anything?” Rodregas asked Imeralda.
 “No.” she responded.
 “Your power is strong and untamed, in flavor more like Doi’van’s power than a nymph’s or AElf’s, but Doi’van can master the spell.
 I think the problem is that for all of your life your power was weak but easy to control.

 “Wait, are we going to go?” Seth and Jason grinned at me and said together, “You bet.” “That is if we can find the place,” Emily reminded them.
 I turned the door knob and walked into the kitchen.
 My mom and dad were sitting in the living room looking extremely excited.
 Before I even had a chance to say hi, my mom jumped up and rushed over to me.
 “You never told us that you applied for a summer camp!” my mom squealed happily.
 “You also didn’t tell us that you were to be picked from the best.
 Congratulations!” She hugged me.
 “Um,” I choked out in surprise as I was squeezed, “I wanted it to be…uh…a surprise.” I managed to get the words out and seem intelligent.

I felt like I was in a secret underground lab, a lab for the soul.
 It was trippy, a mindfuck, you know, but beautiful.
 And this woman, this witchy, beautiful woman embodied all this stuff, she was her surroundings, her home, her personal halidom.
 And she stood there, as silent as the grave, watching me, and, finally—I was dizzy—I turned back to her.
 And she looked like the answer to every question I’d ever had.
 Her breasts seemed, particularly, to invite me, to suckle there, to be born again.

While they guarded her they also kept her at a distance as if she was somehow strange now.
 To them she was supposed to have been consumed by the ritual, and they seemed a little put off to have the AElf maiden standing there.
 Both were watching their prisoner but also throwing quick concerned looks over to where Rodregas now crouched on the tower roof.
 Captain Poir looked hesitant but then nodded.
 He walked over to the table and gathered up the robes.
 “Damn, Rodregas thought” he had said “please.” Master Ravenhurr ordered something done; he did not say “please” to his guard captain.
 As Rodregas stood, Captain Poir held the robe open and he clumsily put it on.
 His movements were awkward in this new larger body.

“Ruby,” I said.
 He looked confused.
 “Soap.” I had been reduced to one-word sentences.
 “Oh.” He nodded, leaning back.
 “She does have a way with potions and such.” “I enjoy the mixing,” Ruby said, startling me again as she entered the house.
 “But not to worry, I keep it contained to elements and minerals, no breeding.

I had the words memorized already; the symbol was what I wanted now.
 The note was proof of the existence of our benefactor, but the sigil on the bottom of the page was a clue to his identity.
 It was incredibly intricate and completely different than anything I'd ever seen.
 Once again I traced the sharp edges and smooth swirls with my eyes, marveling at the way it hinted at further complexity lurking just out of sight.
 With a sigh of resignation I hid the note once again and pulled myself out of bed.
 Convinced as I was that Brandon was our benefactor, I no longer felt any qualms about trusting him to come pick me up.
 I waited in the living room until I saw him pull up, and then skipped out to meet him with a smile.
 He reached over and opened my door, but some of the usual casualness was missing from his smile.

 Readers are strongly advised to pick up Torn next and then proceed on to Splintered.
 The most cost effective way to purchase Splintered is as part of the Bitten Reflections Story Bundle.
 Bitten gets you the next six installments of the Reflections series—plus a bonus short story—for 37% off of the normal price.
 Author's Note: In some ways it feels like I've been at this for decades, in other ways it feels like I only just sat down to try and put Adri's story down in words.
 Now that it's live, I can only say that I hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
 If you haven't read Torn yet, please go check it out.
 When I set out to write Broken, I never expected that I was going to end up writing the same story from Alec's point of view, but I'm pleased with how both Broken and Torn have turned out, both individually and as a combined work.
 They are done in very different styles, but ultimately that was exactly what I was after.
 I think there is plenty of cross-over of guys reading paranormal romance, and girls picking up more action-packed stories.

 “Actually, I can tell you a lot.” “Great, I’m all ears.” She laughed.

She added the last bullet; Toad Dwarf said to Jason, “He will destroy all half-ling.” What does “half-ling mean?
 “Did the dwarfs tell you anything?” I asked, taking the paper.
 None of what she wrote on the paper made any sense to me.
 She shook her head.
 “No and if they did, I was too busy trying to burn them to hear them.” She took the paper back.
 “Well I think the only thing we’ve established is that toad dwarves are crazy.” Seth said.
 I noticed a thin, red line on his cheek where a thrasher must have scratched him.
 Emily wagged her finger at him.

In fact it wasn’t until just a couple years ago that I could watch a speech by one of their number without wetting myself and shaking in fear.
 But onto other things well she always was a wonderful cook, with mushrooms and brownies being her specialties, we had those a lot, when there was enough to eat anyways.
 We were poor but happy, often mother would make us clothes out of flowers and stuff, they were colorful and pretty during the summer and they smelled real good.
 But when winter came we would be real cold and sometimes our clothes would fall off, which was real bad when we were away from home trying to make some money to help support us.
 Doctor – (really into drawing on one of the papers on the clipboard and not really paying attention)  (speaks periodically throughout Character 1’s monologue without looking up) Zat is very interesting!
 Fascinating!
 Character 1- Well and then there was father…I never met him personally, but mother said that he was hard at work at his job of making license plates for the state, and from time to time she would point one out and say ‘kids, your father might have made that one’ or some other such thing, it wasn’t until I was sixteen that I found out that dad was in prison as a serial jay-walker and general public nuisance.
 (notices the doctors obsession with the drawing)  Um what are you doing?
 Doctor – (startled) I am writing notes on your fascinating case, it’s a thing that we doctors do you know.

Ravenhurr’s eyes had an intensity about them, a habit of weighing everyone else and finding them wanting.
 Rodregas felt that Ravenhurr saw in everyone else a lesser person whose best function was to be used by his betters.
 Rodregas looked over the rooftop following Ravenhurr’s eyes.
 Most of the open flat roof of the tower was covered in various circles.
 The largest circle held all the others and was made of a glittering white sand-like substance.
 Its diameter had been drawn as large as possible within the limitations of the roof’s edges.
 On the inside were sigils, runes, and small candles set out every few feet.
 Rodregas knew enough of magic to understand that the purpose of this circle was to keep out unwanted magical influences.
 They could interfere with the spell casting inside the circle.
 Also, the circle would hold in any magical forces inside which someone wanted to store or manipulate.

 She'd probably like chocolate.
 There wasn't time to make anything, so chocolate ice cream would have to do.
 He still couldn't believe that this had happened.
 He didn't believe in extraterrestrials, he didn't believe in ghosts, and he certainly didn't believe that people could travel through time.
 But here she was.
 His mind reeled with the implications and unreality of it all.
 And the emotion that permeated his jumbled thoughts was guilt.

 He took her face in his hands and rained kisses on her mouth.

 He raised his head to look at her.

He laughed, setting her back to look at her.
 "We'll go inside and get it.
 But you have to tell me what happened.
 You wanted so badly to go home."
 He gazed down into her eyes.
 "You loved me, and you were completely torn apart, yet you wanted to go home so badly that you left me.
 What happened?"
 Tears shimmered in her eyes.

His swords had swung.
 The weight of blood was on his shoulders, and who was he to fight against it?
 “I’m sorry if I’m weak,” Harruq whispered to his sleeping brother.
 “I can’t be like you.
 I can’t be strong like you…”
 The half-orc buckled the old pair of swords next to the gleaming black blades on his belt.
 He then gently took his brother into his arms and carried him back to town.
 The weight of his brother in his hands was a feather compared to the burden on his heart.

Sylvia had a piano, the only treasure in a living room full of hand-me-down furniture.
 When Richard wasn’t plunking on it, weaving garrulous runs around the melodies of old standards, he gawked at TV horror movies.
 Eric, Sylvia, and I discussed religion and books.
 She attended no church but disdained atheists.
 Lord of the Flies she called propaganda by which teachers could argue the superiority of adults.
 Catcher in the Rye she applauded because Holden Caulfield appreciated jazz and was nearly as cynical as herself.
 She dismissed Nietzsche as a syphilitic blowhard.
 While we gabbed, Richard might eye us as though he had something to say.
 But the moment would pass, and he would turn back to gawk at the tube until Sylvia ordered him to fetch her cigarettes, or made him stand still while she straightened his tie, or checked to see that he had zipped all the way.
 Observing them made us recommit ourselves to becoming supermen.

One moment I was quietly studying, an instant later hordes of shape shifters were pouring into the mansion.
 Most of them looked just like Simon and Nathanial, pony-sized wolves moving with blinding speed as they tore through doors and raced down halls.
 Brandon came in immediately behind the first batch of wolves.
 There was no way I could've known that the gray monster who casually sliced through walls and two-by-fours with his wickedly curved claws was Brandon, but I was somehow certain.
 He was built just like Alec had been Friday night, only so much bigger that he had to crouch forward to avoid hitting his head on the unusually high ceilings.
 Donovan faced off against one of the first wolves, but it was obvious he was no match for the grace and power of his opponent.
 The gentle, aging butler was knocked to the ground between one heartbeat and the next.
 I was mercifully spared from seeing the wreckage left when Brandon's wolves moved on, but there was no doubt in my mind that Donovan was dead.
 Screams, distant enough that they had to be coming from the other wing of the house, reached out and pierced my heart.
 There wasn't any way to be sure whether or not it was Rachel or her mother, but ultimately it didn't really matter.

But it wasn’t anything important.” “You didn’t turn down another racquetball game because of me, did you?”  His refusing the game had both thrilled her and made her feel guilty.
 “No—no racquetball game.”  When she quirked an eyebrow at him, he admitted, “A brunch.” Her eyes widened.
 “Are you seeing a young lady?
 Rick, I—“ “No, no.”  He sat down beside her.
 “She’s just a friend.
 We’ve gone out a few times.” “Still, I don’t want to disrupt your life.
 You should accept her invitation.” “I don’t want to.
 I’d rather be with you.” She smiled and leaned over to kiss his cheek, but she could no longer concentrate on her book.
 How could it be that a man she’d known only a week wanted to be with her all the time when she’d gone four or five days at a time without seeing the man to whom she was betrothed?
 Could it be that Davis’ job was harder than Rick’s?

(And, an aside: they did not feel it necessary to include that one song on the LP by the drummer.
 An uncommon display of wisdom for the times but a good thing.
 Skippy could no more sing or write a song than fly.)
 Listen to “Blues for Wendy Ward.” Listen to “In Real Time Nothing Happens.”  Listen to “A Marriage of Rue” or “Hayley Mills’ Underpants.”  It’s there.

Occasionally the sun would break through the mist, making me squint, and I would appreciate the calmer, hazier atmosphere.
 Gloom, as they called it at home, in the usually sunny village where I would spend my eternity.
 I wondered where I would be kept as a captive, if there would be windows, if I was unfit for public view.
 Chevelle picked up speed after we passed through the more difficult part of the trail and then we rode fast the rest of the day.
 I struggled to keep up.
 I was sure I knew the cause of his hurry.
 He’d decided he wanted to get this journey over with, end it and return me to the council for punishment, to be done with me.
 We rode long into the evening, well past sunset, and I began to wonder if he would stop at all.
 I was contemplating possible ways to sleep on a horse when he finally stopped.
 We were riding through a small pass, the moonlight barely lighting our way, and Chevelle’s horse disappeared.

 Just a couple things I would like you to do though.
 Eugene – What do you need?
 I’ll do what I can.
 As long as I don’t have to deal with Jerry.

 First, I want you to stay out of trouble.
 No evil schemes or taking over the world and so forth, either go back to school or come work for me, which ever works best for you, just keep your nose clean.
