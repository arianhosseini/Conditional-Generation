The horror must have stretched time, making the few seconds seem like minutes.
 I struggled to bring myself back.
 I could hear nothing but a piercing squall.
 I willed my eyes open, though only a fraction.
 I was looking at the back of a horse from my position slung over someone‚Äôs shoulder.
 My eyes closed once more as the pain doubled and I lost my body for a moment.
 I concentrated until I got it back and then realized I was bouncing.
 I worked my eyes again, using every ounce of control I had left.
 I was on a horse, running.
 Not my own.

I'm so sorry to be such a bother."
 The words were broken by gasping sobs, but they were understandable, if only just barely.
 Alec's hand on my shoulder just made me try to roll away.
 I didn't want his pity.
 Not after everything else he'd already done for me.
 Guilting him into helping me more just felt wrong.
 He captured me in his iron grip, stopping me from getting up and running away.

Britney quickly used up her allotment of complaints, and then subsided into silence as she led the way to an out-of-the-way corner of the old school.
 I'd noticed Britney liked to position herself so she was closest to the middle of the hall.
 Admittedly, dodging all the people trying to get into their lockers wasn't much fun, but I suspected her real motivation was a desire to ensure she could see and be seen, which was much more easily accomplished by relegating me to the outside position.
 Normally I'd have just viewed her theatrics with amusement, but it'd been a long day and I wasn't in the mood.
 If I'd known for sure where we were heading, I'd have considered cutting her off, even with all of the probable fallout, but I didn't.
 Instead I just sighed, followed her around a corner, and collided with six-plus feet of muscled goodness packaged in a white polo shirt that looked worryingly familiar.
 Brandon caught me as I rebounded from him, easily stopping my momentum before I could stumble into a locker.
 "We'd better be careful; I'm starting to sense a trend."
 I wanted to say something equally witty, but his shirt did wonderful, probably illegal things to his gray eyes, and his perfectly straight teeth were parted in a friendly grin that couldn't possibly be meant for me.
 I managed a feeble grin before the silence stretched too far towards becoming uncomfortable, but it was a pathetic attempt.

I jerked up, hoping she hadn‚Äôt seen the journal.
 It wasn‚Äôt lying there.
 I grabbed my pack, pretending to get ready, and sighed when I felt it tucked inside.
 I didn‚Äôt remember doing it, but I was grateful I had.
 I was really getting into the story.
 I yawned and stretched, and then followed her out of the room.
 I was surprised at the size of the fort.
 We went down several corridors and passed a few doors before finally coming to a large, open arena where the others waited for us.
 Chevelle smiled at me as I passed him on the way to my horse.
 I started to command the horse to kneel, but then Steed grabbed me at the waist and threw me up.

Maize yields in Greece, Chile, Austria, Italy and Germany average more than double the world average, and five to six times the averages achieved in large maize-producing countries such as India.
 Even comparing areas under irrigated maize, average yields range from 1.5 to 8.4 tons per hectare.
 New varieties of maize are under development that yield 30 per cent more grain in a drought season than conventional varieties.
 They could be especially effective in lowland tropics, including much of Africa.
 Potato yields in Belgium and the Netherlands are roughly three times the world average.
 This productivity gap between what is routinely achieved by different countries represents a vast immediate potential for improving yields that does not require significant additional investment of time or money in R & D. The world already possesses the knowledge, technology and organizational capacities to raise considerably average world yields in major crops.
 Emphasizing cultivation practices
 The phenomenal increases in productivity achieved over the past three decades through the development of improved and hybrid varieties of seeds have over shadowed and distracted attention from the equally great potential of raising yields through improvements in methods of cultivation.
 This is especially true since much of the slowdown in productivity growth is attributable to depletion of soil and water resources, which can be partially rectified or offset by improved practices.
 Growing environmental concerns in the West have generated pressure for reducing fertilizer consumption in developing countries, when in most instances fertilizer application levels are lower than those in Western Europe by a factor of five or ten times.

Still, I couldn't help envy such contentment.
 I dropped off my bundle of papers at Mrs. North's class, and started back towards my locker.
 I couldn't help trying to catch another glimpse of the art class as I walked past.
 I'd been hoping to see Alec again, but hadn't expected him to look up as I craned my neck to see inside.
 I stumbled a little in surprise.
 He was still gorgeous, but the simple joy was gone.
 He no longer looked like something that couldn't exist in this world, but even with anger etched on his features my heart still skipped a beat.
 I ducked around the corner and started down the stairs, my embarrassment at being caught staring giving way to anger.
 It didn't make any sense.
 I'd never done anything to him.

He went down to the left of the ledge and followed a steep path.
 I walked behind him and had to dig my heels in to avoid from slipping down.
 The path ended and Seth had to jump down to reach the bottom.
 He landed gracefully but almost tripped.
 I walked up to the edge of the path and jumped off.
 I flung my arms out to steady myself.
 Seth grinned at my clumsiness and waited for me to walk up to him.
 I wacked his head with the back of my hand, making his hair stick up.
 He smoothed it down and we walked across the flat ground.
 The ground had spots of grass sticking out of sand and rock.

Even worries about school wouldn't cushion me now that I'd had an attack today.
 There was nothing left but to wrap myself in numbness as I traveled back and forth between the truck and the house in a slow-moving haze.
 The truck was the smallest one they rented, and we hadn't come even close to filling it up, but it was still dark by the time we finished.
 Mom looked at the mass of boxes, groaned dramatically, and then went to the fridge and broke out the sandwiches we'd purchased when we stopped in town for directions.
 An hour later our beds were made, and I had an outfit laid out for school the next day.
 The clothes weren't mine.
 They'd nearly triggered a full-scale blowup.
 Mom thought I just wanted new clothes.
 I knew we couldn't afford a new wardrobe just because I was temporarily skinny.
 I didn't mind wearing my old stuff, I just didn't want to wear Cin...wear her clothes.

 Her body ached with a pleasure that seemed too intense to bear.

 She shuddered with pleasure as he began kissing her neck.
 He undid the first button on her dress.
 "I want you, Marie," he rasped, raising his head to look into her eyes.
 Marie gazed into his eyes for a moment.
 "I can't!"

Van‚Äôdret hurried through the open doors before the guard changed his mind.
 He normally found the sight of the Immortal Guards reassuring; the great sigil warriors were sworn to the protection of Immortalist, like himself, but he knew these two would cut him down like a common pauper if they sensed he was a danger to their Master.
 There was a short hallway leading from the doors with slim white columns on each side of the hallway, in between each column hung great pieces of art; paintings, sculptures and even a small wall hanging with amazing vibrant colors with a strange abstract design were all preserved in the space.
 Van‚Äôdret was a man of some refinement and appreciation for art, and he wished he had dared to stop and inspect the pieces; they had to be some of the greatest art works in the Realm to be so on display where only those who had been invited to a private meeting with Taiga would see them.
 However Van‚Äôdret dared to do nothing more than glance at them as he hurried forward.
 It would not be smart to make the Guild Dealer wait for even a moment.
 The Guild Dealer Taiga was not such a common man that he did his work from a desk; his desires and commands came during parties and social events.
 However, if you were truly honored, though personal invitations to dine with him in his personal solar overlooking his city you would get told his wishes.
 As Van‚Äôdret stepped through the arch he was struck by the bare simplicity of the solar.
 The city known as the Menagerie of Sky, Earth and Water that Taiga ruled and had created over the centuries was a lush place, full of pleasures and growing things.

 He had dinner with her family two or three times a week, but he and her father always retired to her father's study for the rest of the evening.
 And they'd only gone out alone twice.
 Considering the pattern of the past five weeks, Marie was thrilled when Davis told her that he was taking her out to dinner the next Friday evening.
 But it turned out to be completely unlike the night of their betrothal.
 Davis was in an abominable mood, complaining about the food, the service, even the color of the tablecloth.
 And he was too tired to go dancing after dinner.

 Marie asked as they left the restaurant.

The agreements reached for liberalizing agricultural trade in the Uruguay Round of GATT are an important step forward, but they will not release the full dynamism of the agricultural sector, which is so critical for more rapid growth of incomes and employment in both developing and developed countries.
 In the previous chapter, we have called for rapid reduction leading to a complete elimination of agricultural subsidies and other trade barriers by industrial nations, which can generate a positive multiplier effect.
 It has been estimated that complete liberalization of trade in agricultural commodities would yield an annual gain (in 1992 dollars) of about $25 billion for OECD countries and $22 billion for developing and formerly centrally planned countries.
 Actual gains could be very much higher.
 These subsidies cost Western consumers several hundred billion dollars annually.
 In addition, they lead to dumping of surplus sugar, cereal, milk and beef in developing countries, often pushing down the prices which farmers in these countries receive for their produce to far below their production cost.
 The benefits of eliminating these subsidies would be multiple.
 For instance, eliminating subsidies to sugar-beet growers and dairy farmers in Europe would stimulate greater demand, not only for imported sugar from developing countries, but also for cocoa, which combined with sugar and milk is the basis for the chocolate industry.
 Measures of this type will result in substantially increased demand for agricultural products from developing countries, the first step in an upward spiral of global economic growth that will stimulate industrial exports and job growth in both East and West.

 I didn't want her to say anything she wasn't supposed to, especially not if Alec was having as hard of a time controlling the anger that seemed to be part and parcel of the new shapes everyone was wearing, but I was desperate to start understanding some of what was going on.
 Dominic must've looked away from the fight long enough to see the questions on my face.
 "It's hard to understand just how important the pack structure is.
 The question of who is dominant and who is subordinate drives so much of what we do.
 Even so, it's not nearly as bad as other packs, other places.
 Alec's established clear dominance to everyone else here, but he still probably couldn't make his gentler rules stick if it weren't for the fact that Isaac backs him almost without question."
 The object of our discussion was currently backing away from James while trying to keep Jessica from circling around behind him.

So at last she jumped up and ran into the waves.
 Rick woke up slowly with no idea of how long he'd been asleep.
 It had been an exhausting week, and he'd gotten less sleep than usual.
 Of course, he'd had much more fun than usual too, he thought with a lazy smile.
 He turned to see if Marie was asleep.
 She wasn't there!
 Springing to his feet, he looked around.
 The beach had become crowded while he was asleep, and he didn't see her anywhere.
 "Marie!"
 he called in a moderately loud voice.

Cradled in his arms, I reached up to rub my bleary eyes.
 As I glanced up at him, it struck me how close we were.
 My hand dropped from my face to fall against his chest.
 That didn‚Äôt help.
 Heat rose in my neck; I could feel the corded muscle beneath his shirt.
 I had to look away.
 He must have thought I was searching for Junnie.

 He‚Äôd used the wrong word.
 Occasionally, I watched as a third person.
 My vision would change and my perspective would be off.
 Like when I saw Fannie.
 She was razing the village, slowly tearing it apart.
 Fire and wind and destruction as she cackled and taunted the villagers.
 She dropped them as they ran, sometimes snapping their necks, sometimes breaking a leg so they would have to stay alive to watch their homes burn, their families die.
 There was a large man who forced me to do magic, testing me until I was on the brink.
 He was fierce and wore a long scar across his brow that touched his cheek.

And without the Night‚Äôs Circle, you cannot destroy Kojas forever.‚Äù I started to shake with the intensity of it all.
 ‚ÄúIf the Night‚Äôs Circle destroys Kojas forever, why is he still here?‚Äù June backed up a bit.
 ‚ÄúWe think that our Night‚Äôs Circle wasn‚Äôt strong enough because Mark was seriously injured.

 ‚ÄúYou just put the fate of both worlds on my shoulders.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI put the fate of both worlds on all four of your shoulders.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlright, is that all?‚Äù I asked, eager to leave.
 June nodded and I turned to open the door.
 I was just about to turn the handle when she said, ‚ÄúJazell, don‚Äôt be scared to bring out your emotions.

 Without another word he strode out.
 Imeralda followed him as did all the squire‚Äôs attendants.

 Rodregas left his shield and mace relaxed at his side and strode over to Nordien, who stood with shield and mace at the ready.
 Instead of attacking he asked the big man, ‚ÄúSo, are people right, do you plan to serve the Immortalists if you gain the greater sigil?‚Äù The squire looked around a little confused.

 I make a judgment call that I know will not make the undercover narcotics team happy but she is right, what is my great reason justifying not driving a short distance?
 I tell her I will drive right over and park by the Starbucks.
 I hang up with her and I state into my wire that we are moving to the Starbucks and to deal with it.
 My head set rings from my personal cell phone and the lead officer is a combination of irritated and understanding but he warns me to drive slowly and not to get too far in front of the van which will be coming in behind me.

 Now, on that very same spot, he would rescind that agreement.
 Beyond the clearing loomed several palisades.
 All nearby windows were closed, and several boarded.
 A few humans stuck their heads out their doors to glimpse the armored men trampling through their city.
 Most kept themselves far from danger.
 ‚ÄúElves and men of the city of Woodhaven,‚Äù Antonil shouted.
 ‚ÄúBy order of the noble and sovereign King of Neldar, all elven kind has been banned from human lands.

 "From your bewildered expression during class it appears you aren't transferring in from another school.
 I expect most of your other teachers are just letting you pick up from where they are now.
 I'm afraid this class builds on itself, so I'll be testing you on everything we've covered in the past month.
 I'm sure you've got a full class load, but we haven't gotten into anything truly difficult yet.
 The sooner we get you caught up, the better off you'll be.

 The prospect of trying to catch up, all the while needing to master new material and deal with a full schedule of other classes, was too much.
 I felt tears rising to the surface even as my heartbeat sped up to near-panic attack levels.
 That was the last thing I needed, but I could only fight off so many worries at once, and I was quickly approaching my limits.

Government policies based on recognition of this fact can considerably improve the climate for development of these nations and correspondingly stimulate further growth in the West.
 Freer international trade will generate a flood of cheaper goods from the developing world that will give rise not only to greater purchasing power and higher standards of living for the Western consumer, but also to a ‚Äòdemand boom‚Äô for sophis ticated Western goods and services to improve infrastructure and meet the needs of billions of consumers in developing countries.
 The vast inequalities in living standards that persist within both developing and industrial nations, and between the most and least economically developed countries, result in an enormous global loss of incomes and jobs.
 Accelera ting the development of poorer nations and poorer sections of the population in each country is the most powerful instrument and the surest guarantee of continued growth of jobs and incomes for everyone in the next century.
 Strategies for Developing Countries
 For the developing countries as a whole, the most critical question is how to create quickly hundreds of millions of jobs for the poor with limited purchasing power and limited capital for investment.
 The idea that most of these jobs could be created in the corporate sector or by government-sponsored activities has been put to rest.
 Currently, there are nearly one billion self-employed and unpaid family workers in the world, most of them self-employed farmers in developing countries.
 The self-employed represent 48 per cent of the workforce in low-income economies (less than $500 per capita GDP).
 For any strategy to be successful, it must give central importance to self-employment and entrepreneurship, with emphasis on agriculture, agro-industry and small firms in the informal sector.

I have felt somewhat the same about a few others, at least for a time.
 But I would be lying if I claimed to feel all that about God.
 My problem invites the question: how can I adore God when I don‚Äôt quite know what to make of him?
 I hear and read that he‚Äôs a person, and a spirit, who resides everywhere, outside and in us.
 I understand that if my imagination is too small to fathom God as a whole, which of course it is, I can grasp who God is by observing the qualities, nature, and actions of Christ.
 But though I have read, listened, prayed, and pondered about Jesus for dozens of years, in all honesty, given my definition, I can't claim to adore him either.
 Maybe if he were a woman, I could at least come closer to adoration, as I find women easier to adore.
 Not just for the pretty faces or figures, but for their gentler natures.
 Aside from my father and son, I can‚Äôt think of a man I have adored except Eric Curtis.

This shift to multi-party democracy, when coupled with a free press and an independent judiciary, vastly reduces the threat of large-scale wars similar to those that have twice shaken the world in this century.
 Three factors are at play in most conflict situations: the absence of developed democratic institutions, the absence or abuse of fundamental human rights, and the inability to make those choices in the management of public policy on which good governance depends.
 Authoritarian governments find justification for their existence in the presence of external threats to national security, in times of war and during periods of imperialist expansionism.
 They have a vested interest in maintaining a state of tension or initiating conflicts.
 In contrast, empirical evidence shows that liberal democracies do not go to war against one another.
 A study by Dean V. Babst of 116 major wars from 1789 to 1941 revealed that ‚Äòno wars have been fought between independent nations with elective governments‚Äô.
 The reasons for this are several.
 Democracies tend to be more prosperous and better educated.
 They share common political cultures based on individual rights and liberties.
 They establish orderly and peaceful processes for conflict resolution within society.

Initially, about half of the new jobs will be generated on farms by raising productivity through methods to improve management of micro-nutrients and water, expanding the total irrigated area by more complete utilization of the substantial additional capacity that has already been created, emphasis on more labour-intensive commercial crops such as sugar, cotton, fruit, flowers, and vegetables, sericulture, inland and coastal aquaculture, reclamation of wastelands for forestry and fodder, and increasing subsidiary incomes from animal husbandry and poultry.
 The expansion and intensification of cultivation of these products will raise agricultural output by $25 billion and generate approximately 45 million equivalent full-time unskilled and semi-skilled jobs in agriculture for unemployed and under-employed farmers and landless labour.
 The additional agricultural production will form raw material for expansion of rural industrialization and non-farm employment.
 Another 10 million jobs will be created in downstream agro-industries located in rural areas - in sugar mills, cotton and textile mills, processing units for fruit, fish and silk, and in marketing and distribution - thus serving as a counter-magnet to urban migration.
 Growth of agro-industry will stimulate demand for industrial machinery and services.
 The multiplier effect of skyrocketing rural demand will stimulate demand in a broad range of consumer industries and create an estimated 45 million rural and urban jobs in industry and services.
 Funding for the strategy would come from a mix of public sector and private sector investment.
 The funding requirements are within the range of current five-year projections: 84 per cent of additional planned investment in agriculture and 25 per cent of additional planned expenditure in industry.
 The average cost per additional job is less than $1,000, roughly one-tenth the average cost of jobs in India's private sector and one-hundredth the cost of new jobs in the public sector.
 Implementation of the strategy will require a substantial investment in training of both on-farm and industrial workers, but the plan is based on the recognition that enhancing the skills of the nation's rural work-force will take time and must be done incrementally.

 If this was betrayal, then so be it.
 He would pay the cost.
 Great spasms racked his body.
 All the power Velixar had granted him fled.
 His muscles shrank inward, tightening in great, painful shudders.
 Several minutes passed as the horrendous pain tore through his arms, chest, and legs.
 Aurelia held him as he lay sobbing in pain.
 She did her best to comfort him, stroking his hair until all his dark strength drained away.

It is right that the world community should generously support the successful completion of the reform process in this region that is so vital for world peace.
 But it is also right that these countries should recognize the enormous untapped potentials which they possess ‚Äì human, natural and productive ‚Äì rather than be distracted by the prospect of a large influx of foreign capital.
 ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY IN YUGOSLAVIA
 The extreme damage wrought by the economic reform programme in these countries over the past half decade necessitates an urgent search for more viable alternatives, a search that has been retarded until now by the widely held view that none exists.
 Very recent events in Yugoslavia suggest that even in the limited area of economic stabilization and adjustment, an alternative strategy can be more successful.
 Although the long-term impact of the Yugoslav experiment is an yet unknown, its remarkably positive initial results merit serious consideration.
 The economic disorder that accompanied recent political developments in Yugoslavia resulted in an explosive increase in prices of more than 100 per cent per month in 1992.
 Despite efforts to control monetary expansion, hyperinflation exceeded three million per cent in 1993 - far higher than the inflation rate reached in Germany following the First World War and, quite probably, the highest rate in recorded history.
 The price spiral was accompanied by a steep fall in real purchasing power by as much as 75 per cent.
 The budget deficit increased rapidly as the value of government tax revenues fell further and further behind the rising cost in current terms of its expenditures, due to the time lag between tax declaration, collection and expenditure in a period of very rapid price increases.

Which is why ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Seem to Make Her Mine‚Äù shows up on the bootleg, also.

 At least, whoever put the fucker together had some chops, knew a thing or two‚Äîit‚Äôs a fairly seamless melding of two different versions of the song, incorporating a blistering solo I did on it live with a somewhat coherent rendering we put down at Ardent.

"No.
 If you're really worried about it just make sure that one of the others are in the room at the same time with you."
 "Now that has some real possibilities."
 I was still rolling the thought around in my mind when the bell rang and Alec pulled me to my feet.
 We swapped out our books and were halfway to Spanish when Vincent and Brandon strode into view.
 Moving so smoothly I was positive that nobody else even realized anything was wrong, Alec swung me around so he was between them and me.
 The tension ratcheted up in step with the rolling waves of energy, as Brandon and Vincent drew nearer.
 They split up when they saw us, casually positioning themselves so Alec couldn't protect me from both of them.
 I felt my knees stop working as I took in Brandon's lazy, confident smile, and Vincent's sick, eager expression, but the gentle pressure of Alec's grasp on my hand kept me from falling down.
 I looked up at Alec, hoping for a reassuring smile, but his face had taken on the expressionless mask he used to guard his thoughts.

I read every minute I wasn't washing pots, or smooching with Liz, or so drained from everything I couldn't help fall asleep.
 I even cut off some dates long before Liz's midnight curfew to come home and read.
 My room became Raskolnikov's basement garret.
 If my mom dared enter to bring me a sandwich, I grabbed the plate, shooed her out, shut the door, and usually didn't bother to eat.
 Early in the novel Raskolnikov is in a tavern with a drunk, Marmeledov, whose daughter Sonia has prostituted herself for the money to feed her destitute step-mother and brothers and sisters.
 Marmeledov tells of a dream in which God sets straight the wise men who object to his accepting Sonia into glory: "Here is why, oh you wise, here is why, oh you of understanding‚Äî-her sins which are many are forgiven for she has loved much."
 I jotted the quote on a slip of paper and kept it in my wallet until it disintegrated.
 The only time in my rather lengthy existence I have so treasured an idea.
 Liz wanted more attention from me than I wanted to give.
 But we played fairly well together until, one Sunday evening, I wanted to go to a certain dance, which was held weekly and at which I always danced with other girls in addition to Liz.

Just as he ran into the surf, he heard a familiar laugh.
 He turned to see Marie jump to catch a frisbee.
 She threw it to one of three--no, four--guys surrounding her.
 "Marie!"
 She turned to wave to him.
 "Hi, Rick!
 Do you want to play frisbee?"
 "No."
 He watched her play for a couple of minutes and then headed back toward the blanket.
 Marie ran after him.

It was with enough power to have snapped a normal man‚Äôs neck, but Van‚Äôdret looked more startled than hurt.
 ‚ÄúGag him and don‚Äôt let him move his fingers,‚Äù said Imeralda.
 Even as Doi‚Äôvan nodded he slapped his open palm against Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs mouth and used his other hand to grab one of the sorcerer‚Äôs free hands.
 Rodregas grabbed the other.
 ‚ÄúPut him on the ground and kneel on him,‚Äù Rodregas said to Doi‚Äôvan.
 The Hellborn nodded and pushed the sorcerer down on the cold stone ground.
 He next straddled the man with his knees, pining his shoulders.
 ‚ÄúI am going to ask him a few questions.
 If either of you think he is going to cast a spell, kill him.‚Äù The other two nodded at Rodregas.
 Rodregas reached down and slid the blade under the sorcerer‚Äôs chin and said, ‚ÄúOne spell and you die,‚Äù he then nodded to Doi‚Äôvan and the Hellborn lifted his hand a few inches from Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs mouth.

In the developing world, more than 80 per cent of the water is utilized for agriculture, an unsustainable level that is depleting water tables, increasing soil salinity and accelerating erosion.
 Although historically water has often been a source of contention between communities, it has never been the cause of an open inter-state conflict.
 However, nearly one-half of the world‚Äôs land surface consists of river basins shared by more than one country and more than 30 nations receive more than one-third of their water from outside their borders.
 Therefore, the danger of confrontation and conflict will escalate unless concerted measures are implemented urgently.
 Water shortages occurring in combination with other sources of tension ‚Äî such as in the Middle East ‚Äî will be particularly worrisome.
 Famine remains a persistent threat precisely because the world no longer feels that threat to be severe.
 India‚Äôs last major famine occurred in Bengal in 1943 during World War II.
 Although the deficit in food production was only marginal that year, three million died for lack of strong administrative intervention to improve distribution.
 A marginal deficit could work havoc in the absence of an efficient and equitable public distribution network.
 While there is no scarcity of food in the world, there is also not a sufficiently organized effort to promote food security, precisely because the sense of urgency is lacking.

He was in an honest-to-goodness full tux.
 I wasn't the only one stunned by how good he looked; there was a ripple of turned heads as people noticed his entrance.
 He paced the short distance down to the back row of seats with such incredible grace that I felt my mouth go dry.
 No one person should be so attractive, not when there wasn't enough of him to go around to every single woman in the world.
 For a few seconds I forgot all about the reasons I didn't like him, and just wished he was sitting in front of me instead of two rows behind me where I couldn't see him.
 Then I realized what his arrival really meant.
 Rachel had stood me up.
 She wasn't on the bus, and she apparently hadn't come with her brother, so she wasn't coming.
 I knew I should reserve judgment until I'd given her a chance to explain what'd happened, but it was hard to remember that when faced with Alec's air of superiority.
 Rachel was nicer, but she was still a Graves.

I felt like my head should be reeling from the sheer stupidity.
 Even in a town this small, it didn't seem like the competition for the available males should be a matter for death threats.
 Brandon took my head shaking as denial of what he'd said, rather than disbelief regarding the situation.
 "I promise that every word I just told you is true.
 More importantly, I promise I'll make sure nothing terrible happens to you."
 Looking into Brandon's caring eyes, I almost couldn't believe any of it.
 Being threatened and then having the perfect man come to your rescue didn't happen in real life.
 Then again, maybe I was due for some happy endings.
 With a sigh, I thanked him for the ride, and we parted ways.
 The only thing of note that happened in Biology was that for a few moments at the beginning of the hour it almost seemed that the near-constant stares had somehow changed and taken on a more sympathetic tone than they'd had previously.

I opened my mouth to ask him what he meant, only to be distracted by the sound of the Jeep's engine as it rolled to a stop on the cement pad.
 As I looked back, Alec's eyes captured me.
 "You're sure this is what you want?"
 I managed a nod, and then the downstairs door crashed open.
 "Adri, honey.
 Where are you?"
 Alec was gone when I looked back.
 Only the slight sway of my curtains gave evidence he'd just casually jumped out of my second-story window.

Mom didn't seem to think it was at all odd that the city had flip-flopped so completely on the job.

 None of it made sense, but she seemed perfectly ready to accept everything at face value.
 Maybe her way was the best.
 I certainly envied her.
 Not the not knowing, but the fact that she didn't have to worry about what it all meant.
 How did I get stuck being the parent, while she got to be the kid?

Although the concept may vary from place to place, the central approach is to examine in detail the current usage of both land and water resources and then formulate a district level plan for utilizing available physical, technological, human, managerial and financial resources in a sustainable manner to optimize, over time, production, productivity, farm incomes and employment, non-farm occupations, self-employment opportunities, agro-industrial development, exports and expansion of the service sector.
 This analysis is likely to identify a wide gap between present and potential achievements, which can form the basis for creating an alternative district development plan.
 Government can seek the assistance of farmers' organizations, private enter prise, educational and research institutes, and voluntary agencies for gathering information, analysis and plan formulation.
 Implementation of the plan should be primarily through activities that facilitate more efficient operation of market forces, such as assisting farmers to identify and transfer improved technology, establishing commercial organizations of small farmers and linkages between farms and industry, disseminating in formation on markets and technology, demonstration, education, training and incentives to stimulate rapid multiplication.
 The UN development force can undertake to assist countries in the design and implementation of model district programmes in food deficit countries, and to transfer the expertise needed for replication in other parts of each country.
 5.World food model.
 The actual structure and dynamics of the development of global agriculture and its relationship to industrial ization, employment and trade needs to be fully understood in order to plan for, and achieve, a world free of hunger.
 Although national and international institutions maintain a variety of data bases and models to track the impact of production, trade and prices in agriculture, these models are too limited in scope and detail to construct a working global model of the agricultural sector, which could serve as a valuable tool in projecting the medium- and long-term interactions of changes in food production, consumption, employment, trade, productivity, technology and environmental factors.
 A world food model, which forms the essential basis for evolving a global strategic plan, can help eliminate both food deficits and surpluses.

 I did talk to my mother the next morning and told her that I had met the woman I was going to marry‚Äîand it wasn‚Äôt either of the two brunettes in my bed.
 Gimme a break, it was the eighties!
 The bartender made a call for me to his girlfriend in an attempt to get my dream girl‚Äôs number.
 I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be easy because as it turns out she knew of me through high school and my reputation preceded me.
 Would this ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù give her number to a ‚Äúbad boy?‚Äù The ploy worked and somehow Lisa agreed to let me call her.
 Lisa had been dating a guy for years and I knew of him.
 He had attended our high school and he was the quarterback of the football team (my polar opposite).
 She had only come to the club the night I met her because she was angry with her boyfriend because he choose to spend Valentine‚Äôs Day with his brother playing basketball (take notes boys).
 She had called a friend who told her she could get her into this bar because she knew the bartender and they were both under legal drinking age.

 Before Qurrah could ask what Velixar meant, his master was already in the midst of another spell.
 Inky darkness rose all about his feet, swirling like black floodwaters.
 Chills crept up his ankles as the liquid darkness grew.
 Velixar cried out the final words of the spell, spreading the darkness for a mile in all directions, so high it covered up to their necks.
 ‚ÄúIt is cold,‚Äù Qurrah said, his teeth chattering.
 ‚ÄúYou will not be harmed by it,‚Äù Velixar said, watching the approaching army.
 ‚ÄúWith so much hidden, they will be hard pressed to target us among my undead.

I rose above, peering down at myself, and the image turned into my mother, the dark water going black, the ripples transforming to wind.
 I recognized the scene as her pendant began to glow, the wind howling, screams piercing my ears.
 It was the same dream, but different now.
 I glanced around to find a village I didn‚Äôt know.
 Someone was coming toward me, an expression of fear and sadness on his handsome face.
 His familiar face.
 He reached out to me and I stepped toward him, tears streaming down my cheeks.
 He wrapped his arms around me as I turned again to see my mother.
 A howl of rage escaped her and I started to go to her, but he held me.
 He was restraining me.

Jessica seemed to shrink in on herself, and then she turned and ran away with a final hiss of defiance.

 Alec's almost imperceptible nod sent him in the same direction as Jessica.
 Whatever meager survival instincts I had left chose that moment to finally kick in, and I felt my knees begin to give way.
 Rachel let out a high-pitched sound that had all of the surprise of a squeal, but none of the excitement.
 Apparently Alec knew how to interpret it.
 He turned back and caught me again before I could hit the ground.
 "There isn't anything to worry about now.
 Go ahead and catch your breath."
 As pleasant as it was to be in his arms again, I was starting to worry he'd get tired of it.

A narrow set of stairs climbed to the parapet and Harruq led the way.
 The city gates were lost in the distance, city guards clustered about them.
 ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù Harruq said.
 ‚ÄúOrcs.‚Äù
 He spoke the word with an odd reverence, but they both understood its significance.
 Unlike the humans, the two brothers‚Äô skin was dark and tinged with gray, their ears long and curled to a point.
 They were half-orcs, condemned for the tainted blood coursing through their veins.
 The people of Veldaren hurled the word at them like a dagger, but in truth neither had ever seen a full orc before.
 ‚ÄúNow we‚Äôll finally see,‚Äù Qurrah said, ‚Äúwhat we are, what we are meant to be.‚Äù
 Thousands of orcs spilled into the west, needing no light to see in the darkness.

I was surprised at the size of the fort.
 We went down several corridors and passed a few doors before finally coming to a large, open arena where the others waited for us.
 Chevelle smiled at me as I passed him on the way to my horse.
 I started to command the horse to kneel, but then Steed grabbed me at the waist and threw me up.
 I took one deep breath before we kicked the horses into a gallop and ran from the fort in a pack.
 Our pace finally slowed as the way became too treacherous.
 Massive rock formations loomed over us, loose stones underfoot causing the horses to stumble.
 The haze was so thick I couldn‚Äôt see anything but the riders in front of me.
 I only knew from the strain on my legs we were heading up, climbing higher into the gray sky and biting wind.
 Chevelle rode beside me through the day.

The stranger watched me as I ate.
 When I devoured the first piece, he laughed and threw me another.
 I hoped I looked appropriately abashed.
 As I finished the second serving, he stepped closer to sit on the misshapen rock that rose through the earth beside me.
 He held his hand wide and a canteen flew up from a pile of things on the other side of the fire.
 He passed it to me, and I tilted it back, expecting cool water.
 I almost choked when warm wine hit my throat.
 He leaned forward to get a better look at me as I lowered the container.
 He looked as if he thought I might spook, otherwise I guessed he had plenty to say hidden beneath that smirk.
 It didn‚Äôt stop him from moving uncomfortably close, though, or eyeing me with what I was certain was the same look I‚Äôd just given my meal.

They broke into a small clearing, and there in the center stood a cloaked figure, kneeling down as he turned a meat-covered spit.
 Pressed tight behind an oak tree, I shuffled sideways to get a better view.
 I was sure it was an elf, male, from his size.
 The smell of real food was consuming, and I was watching the cooked meat roll over the flame as I moved again.
 A dry leaf crushed beneath my foot.
 ‚ÄúCome then, there‚Äôs plenty for both of us,‚Äù the figure called.
 I cursed.
 Caught, I walked cautiously out of the trees.
 He turned, tossing the cloak aside as he propped one leg onto a rock.
 I had the strangest notion he was posing.

 It was a source back then, a touchstone.
 You could hear music unavailable elsewhere.
 The music of the planets.
 I listened to it alone in my parent‚Äôs living room, hearing sounds that transformed me as surely as did Lorelei, the finding of my own voice.

Grey.
 He was thoughtful for a moment, deciding the best way to display his skill, before finally approaching to offer his hand.
 I reached forward, placing my palm against his, and then he was gone.
 His entire body had vanished.
 I half expected to feel his touch‚Äîperhaps he‚Äôd merely camouflaged himself‚Äîbut my hand was empty.
 I looked around, baffled.
 The makeshift audience wore easy, amused smiles.
 They watched me, not the vacant space from which Grey had evidently disappeared.
 And then I noticed someone beside me who hadn‚Äôt been there before‚Ä¶ it was him.
 ‚ÄúHow‚Ä¶‚Äù But he was gone again.

For a few seconds they rolled forward, and then Rick saw her relax.
 "OK, press on the gas pedal.
 Just a little.
 Not--" he grunted--"like that."
 She'd pressed it a little too hard and then, panicking, stepped hard on the brake.
 "I'm sorry."
 She bit her lower lip.
 "It's OK.  We have this whole parking lot--you can't hurt anything.
 Just relax and take your time."
 It took a while for her to get the hang of it, but an hour or so later, she was cruising around the parking lot, making reasonably smooth starts and stops.

Chapter 26 It was amazing how quickly my classes flew by when I had a friend, or at least a protector, with me at all times.
 Then again all of Monday had flown by, not just the school portion of the day, so it really shouldn't have been a surprise today was doing likewise.
 After Spanish, Jasmin had escorted me to Mrs. Campbell's class.
 Telling her I wasn't going to be able to help out at the lab anymore had been one of the harder things I'd ever done, but she'd been surprisingly understanding.
 We'd scheduled my makeup test for the next day and I'd left with the sneaking suspicion she'd guessed more about what was really going on in Sanctuary than either pack would've liked.
 I'd been busy contemplating what Mrs. Campbell might have really figured out as we left the building, only to have Jasmin interrupt my musings with an apology of all things.
 She didn't get into specifics, and it was obvious she was still worried about the coming showdown with Brandon, but I was pretty sure she really was sorry.
 It didn't make us best friends and she was still an enigma, but it was a start.
 It even gave me hope maybe Jessica and James might eventually come around.
 I was still reeling in surprise as we walked out to the parking lot and met up with the rest of the pack, or rather the rest of the pack minus Alec.

I was going to do it.
 And if I got caught?
 I could claim ignorance.
 The entire clan thought I was an imbecile in any case.
 Maybe I would just see how close I could get.
 Maybe just to try‚Ä¶ And then I was there, standing in front of the Council building and walking in.
 My attempt at stealth was a poor endeavor, but no one ever seemed to pay much attention to me anyway.
 I casually leaned around a doorway to see into the next room, where a small group of villagers stood, blocking my way.
 They spoke in low voices, and as I tried to figure a way past, something seized my attention.

‚ÄúCan you tell me your name?‚Äù ‚ÄúElfreda,‚Äù I answered immediately.
 He waited for the rest.
 But I had two answers, didn‚Äôt I?
 I chose.
 ‚ÄúOf North Camber.‚Äù It must have been the right answer, because he grabbed me, exultant, sighing and kissing my skin.
 He held me with a fierceness, a gentleness, that took my breath.
 His lips trailed my cheeks, murmuring words and careful of wounds as they swept to a temple, my eyelid, the corner of my mouth.
 He lingered there, unable to resist touching the broken skin of my lips, even if it were only feather light, the barest brush of skin.
 He drew away slowly, feeling my shock, or seeing it in my eyes, and realizing his mistake.
 His expression fell, but he didn‚Äôt take his hands away.

I think I called him once from town and said something like, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me about any of the shit that‚Äôs going down.

I gasped as I realized what Alec must have suspected for quite some time.
 "You mean that was really him in my dreams?"
 "Indeed.
 That's part of why he was so concerned you might be a powerful Fir'shan posing as a normal human."
 A tiny sound just outside the door preempted my next question.
 Alec carefully maneuvered a pair of huge metal baskets in through the door.
 I felt my eyes go wide as I realized that they were full of hundreds of cans of food.
 I didn't even want to guess at how much weight was in each basket, but as Alec cleared the door it was obvious that the slow speed that he'd been moving at had only been due to him not wanting to hit anything.
 He moved like they weighed no more than a couple of pillows as he crossed the cabin and set them down in front of what must be the food pantry.

"There isn't anything wrong with letting someone help you.
 Sometimes a helping hand is exactly what's called for."
 The memory had a vividness that'd been lacking lately.
 It was the same aching realism that'd devoured nearly a month of my existence before I finally decided I had to try and go on with my life, for Mom's sake if for no other reason.
 I panicked when I realized just how badly I wanted to slip back into that twilight world where nothing hurt, where it didn't matter if people liked me or not.
 The one where I still had all three of the most important people in my world.
 The fear that I'd give in, that I'd end up in a hospital during the day or two it took Mom to realize I hadn't made it home from school, pulled me back sooner than normal.
 For a second my mind inhabited a body that wouldn't obey any of the normal commands.
 Fear snaked out from my center when my eyes wouldn't open, but before my heart could really start accelerating, my eyelids started functioning again.
 The desks on the route between Alec and I were lying haphazardly on their sides, but there wasn't any sign of Alec.

I‚Äôve no idea why they attacked him.

 ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù A wry smile crossed his lips and I couldn‚Äôt help but focus on them for a moment.
 ‚ÄúBecause the wolves would have fought to the death, and Grand Council does not kill animals with magic.‚Äù I remembered my mother.

His movements were awkward in this new larger body.
 His angle was wrong, Rodregas felt like he was standing on a crate.
 ‚ÄúShould I order the birthday celebration milord?‚Äù asked the captain.
 The coming celebration had been the talk of speculation for months as well as the object of more than a little betting among the guards.
 Rodregas nodded, his thoughts swirling as he realized that he could use the celebration to his benefit.
 Without looking at the captain he walked toward the stairway, and the captain followed close behind him.
 At the door Rodregas took a deep breath and said, ‚ÄúCaptain, that ceremony did not go smoothly, but the gods once again proved to favor me, and I wish to be generous with the birthday ceremony.
 Tell the purser to pay everyone an extra month‚Äôs wages today and give everyone a week off to spend as they wish.

 The streets were all the same to him, so down them all he wandered.
 The image of Aurelia and Harruq danced in his mind, and conflicting feelings rippled through his chest.

Is that a real place?"
 I nodded, hoping Alec would take the hint implied in my silence.
 I should have known better.
 "What's it called?"
 The name slid out of me almost of its own accord.
 "Monster Lake."
 Every single birthday I could remember had involved some kind of trip out to Monster Lake.
 Picnics had swapped off with treasure hunts and then been replaced by other activities depending on Dad's mood and my age.

 ‚ÄúWhat, Ruby?‚Äù She giggled.
 ‚ÄúHow did you know it was me?‚Äù No one else is that annoying.
 ‚ÄúCan I come in?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù The water streamed from the tub and out the back window.

 ‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôm getting dressed.‚Äù I dried off, gathering clothes from a pile I assumed was for me, too large for Ruby‚Äôs petite frame.
 I opened the door and knew right away I would regret whatever they were about to tell me.

I smiled as I swung at him, sure he would stop me but reveling in being attacker instead of victim.
 He wound his blade around mine, a metallic screech filling my ears as he knocked my strike aside before coming back at me.
 We continued, blow after blow, the repetitive clank forming a pattern in my head.
 Chevelle seemed to be enjoying himself as the exercise increased in intensity.
 I found I was as well.
 I‚Äôd taken no direct beatings like my other training and I wasn‚Äôt getting as tired.
 No magic.

It was a snarling alto that even distorted by anger had traces of smooth velvet, the kind of voice guys occasionally fantasized about, when they weren't thinking about other, less subtle, feminine features.
 Something hit the stall next to me, hard enough to leave dents.
 I was scared, I should have been terrified, but I was too busy trying to breathe.
 It was like the air had become thick, and although the fine strands of hair on the back of my neck hadn't moved, it felt like they should be standing on end.
 I heard indistinct sobbing, and then the voice returned and made me shiver.
 The sensation started somewhere on my back, and traveled forward like it was clawing to get out of my face.
 "I know you're sorry, just like you were sorry before.
 Only I don't really believe you, so we're instituting a new policy.

The elven blade whirled, cutting two out of the air.
 The third smacked into his throat.
 Luckily, the bone was part of a finger and lacked a sharp enough edge to cut skin.
 Instead, the elf was left gasping as he retreated from another series of strikes from Harruq.
 ‚ÄúPretenders, are we?‚Äù Qurrah asked as his fingers performed a dark weave.
 ‚ÄúHow much I wish for your pride to suffer.‚Äù Magical energy rippled out of him and tore across the air.
 The elf whirled, sensing the incoming invisible blow.
 Only a tiny part hit his shoulder, immediately encasing it in ice.
 Then Harruq was upon him, slashing recklessly.
 Ahrqur batted his sword left and right, then jumped as Harruq swung back in a scissor-cut that should have shredded his waist.

Alec set me down as Vincent appeared, a towering, furred figure illuminated by the light of the flares that'd been planted on either side of the cleared space.
 His dark eyes drank in the light as he surveyed us with his typical boundless arrogance.
 A horde of shifting figures milled about just outside of the twin circles of light.
 The rest of Brandon's pack and they seemed to have grown in number since the dance.
 Jasmin and Dominic crowded up against me, one on either side, and I let my hands brush against their heads.
 The feel of their fur, one short and soft, the other long and coarse, anchored me before the surreal strangeness of the scene could carry me away.
 The tingle of shape shifter power was as strong as I'd ever felt it, jumping from multiple sources, arcing around me as it unsuccessfully looked for a place to ground out.
 For the first time, I was able to accurately pick out the individual signatures that made it up.
 Jess was off to the left, white hot with mixed anger and fear, stabilized only by the cool, controlled pillar of power that was Isaac.
 Jasmin almost hummed under my fingertips like barely-leashed violence, while my other hand drank from the still pond that was Dominic, her mere presence feeding me comfort.

He leaned over, working on something in the palm of his hand, a steady scratching accompanying the movement of his wrist.
 I started forward and my boot scuffed the floor, alerting him to my presence.
 As he glanced up, he slid whatever he‚Äôd been working on into a pocket at his hip.
 It dawned on me then that the main room had only the entrance and two other doors.
 If we were staying with Ruby then the second room must be hers.
 I meant to offer Chevelle my room to sleep in, but the look on his face was so unnerving I could not stop myself from offering something else.
 ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt have to protect me.‚Äù I hoped it was true.
 ‚ÄúI can turn myself in, take myself to the village, or‚Ä¶‚Äù I was trying to say Grand Council, but the words stuck in my throat.
 No part of me wanted to surrender to my mother‚Äôs killers, but I could not make Chevelle suffer more than he already had.
 My hands trembled and I tightened them into fists.

He paused when he found a name written in gold near the hilt.
 ‚ÄúTun‚Äôdel,‚Äù Harruq read aloud, slowly and carefully.
 ‚ÄúHe even has his name on his sword.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúDid I not say he was arrogant?‚Äù
 Harruq stared at the name on the scabbard, mesmerized by the beauty of the writing.
 He ran his fingers over it, enjoying the feeling of pure gold.
 When he covered the second half, he paused.
 ‚ÄúQurrah,‚Äù Harruq said.
 ‚ÄúLook at this.‚Äù

They kept talking, settling into conversation.
 Steed offered Chevelle what was left of the roast and they sat, Chevelle beside me and Steed across from us.
 I picked up the canteen and choked down more wine.
 The evening carried on and though the conversation still held a formal tone, neither man talking of anything personal, they seemed to be getting along.
 I faded in and out of the various discussions, listening occasionally but never talking.
 Steed seemed very aware of me, watching me in a way no one ever had.
 It must have been obvious, because when he excused himself to check the herd, Chevelle studied me, sliding a strand of my now-black hair through his fingers.
 ‚ÄúIt suits you.‚Äù It was a familiar gesture and it should have made me flinch.
 Maybe it was the wine, but as I looked at him, my anger was fading.
 The way he‚Äôd reacted when Fannie had struck me, the caress against my cheek, those were not the actions of a council elder.

‚ÄúOver the centuries, I have gathered many items to aid those who would swear their lives to me,‚Äù Velixar said.
 The locks clicked open, the lid raised, and then he reached inside and pulled out two swords sheathed in gleaming obsidian.
 ‚ÄúThese swords were once wielded by Aerland Shen.
 He led the elves that aided Karak in the great war against Ashhur.
 When Celestia cursed his kind, they shared his curse.‚Äù Velixar smiled at Harruq, his eyes gleaming.
 ‚ÄúLong have I waited for someone to wield these blades.
 An elf crafted and used them in battle, an elf cursed into an orc.
 These swords can only be held by one who has the blood of both inside him.‚Äù Velixar held the hilts out to Harruq, who drew one from its sheath.
 The sword‚Äôs blade was deep black and wreathed in a soft red glow.
 He weaved it through the air, his mouth agape at the ease in which it glided.

Regional and tribal politics have flourished.
 Dozens of civil and inter-state wars have been fought, accounting for millions of lost lives.
 Food production and employment have lagged far behind population growth.
 In the absence of legal channels of protest, opposition parties have frequently resorted to violence.
 By the end of the 1980s the lack of material progress and the emergence of young educated professionals in leadership positions had fostered, on the one hand, a revolt against single-party rule and, on the other, popular pressure for multi-party democracy that have together resulted in a democratic domino effect, similar to the spread of communist rule which Western democracies had feared would overwhelm South Asia twenty years ago.
 As recently as 1989, only four African countries could be considered stable democracies and three more were moving in that direction.
 Only three years later, 18 African nations could be classified as democratic and a number of others were in the midst of far-reaching political change.
 The peaceful end of apartheid in South Africa is one remarkable outcome of this process.
 There are even winds of change in the Middle East, where Jordan has recently shown the way by conducting free elections.
 The role of democracy in development would be even more compelling were it not for the apparently contradictory evidence posed by the recent experience of Russia and China.

I punched him on the shoulder.
 "You knew all this time?"
 Another laugh, and a smile at the way I was trying to conceal how much the punch had hurt my hand.
 "Of course I knew.
 It isn't like I could do anything about that.
 I've never led her on, but I've always been aware she liked me."
 There didn't seem to be much else to be said, so I thanked Brandon again for the ride into school, and headed off to my home room.
 Everyone had pretty much just pretended like I didn't exist before.
 Now, with Brandon having taken an interest in me, I got everything from simple acknowledgment of my presence to obvious dislike, and even a couple of people who looked like they wanted to take Britney's place.
 I suppose some people would have been thrilled by the chance to join the top of the social food chain, but it mostly just disgusted me.

 As she spoke she shook her long auburn hair behind her, something he was starting to realize was a nervous gesture.
 ‚ÄúYes, I think so,‚Äù Rodregas said.
 ‚ÄúI freed them from the dungeon before I left, and then I thought I saw them yesterday.

I wish she was‚Ä¶ different.
 Not merely a different personality, but different altogether.

 That was, of course, until my father.
 But I suppose my sister might be different as well, if not for him.

My leaving Brandon's insane bouquet of flowers at the office instead of lugging it around all day should have helped.
 Apparently they all either thought it was a ploy, or were just too stupid to get the message that I didn't want to jump on the popularity bandwagon.
 Whatever the reason, I'd gotten three invitations to assorted parties or other activities before school ended.
 I even got another two as I hobbled back from the office with my roses, which had decreased during their stay there by exactly the number of office ladies.
 I'd politely declined each invitation, citing my need to catch up in Biology and Spanish, and made it to tutoring without further mishap.
 Another usher, this one thankfully no more fawning than the first, pointed me towards my seat, and I felt my second surge of disappointment for the night.
 My seat was on the main level, but it was only three rows from the very top, and all the way off to one side.
 I guess it really wasn't that surprising.
 If the school was paying for the tickets I should just be glad I hadn't been stuck with a standing room only spot.
 Still, as disappointing as it was that the performers were only barely going to be visible, it wasn't as bad as the nagging worry that Rachel wasn't coming after all.

We had no furniture in that room.
 A boxing match would start with one person calling out another person to fight.
 You could decline but you would endure the collective shaming of the crowd.
 Several sets of boxing gloves were available and once both fighters had their gloves on, the games would begin.
 Cowering in a corner was never a good strategy as the crowd only pushed you back to the center.
 The room erupted when the action was good and the fights were a scrappy version of actual boxing.
 The fight was over when you surrendered or you were knocked out.
 I fought many times and I do not remember ever losing.
 As I said, I had grown up facing a much tougher opponent than anyone in the room.
 I was rarely injured because I had learned to protect myself from the powerful blows of my stepfather and I knew how to look for an opening and drop my opponent.

Beyond the clearing loomed several palisades.
 All nearby windows were closed, and several boarded.
 A few humans stuck their heads out their doors to glimpse the armored men trampling through their city.
 Most kept themselves far from danger.
 ‚ÄúElves and men of the city of Woodhaven,‚Äù Antonil shouted.
 ‚ÄúBy order of the noble and sovereign King of Neldar, all elven kind has been banned from human lands.

 This will not be tolerated any longer.

The world needs a coherent intellectual framework for understanding and dealing with radical transitions.
 High priority should be given to developing a fresh conceptual approach that is not en cumbered by allegiance to existing theories and systems.
 Transitions should be regarded as social transformations which depend on and result in corresponding changes in the political, economic and other spheres.
 Efforts to guide a multi-dimensional social transition through uni-dimensional strategies, particularly those limited to manipulation of macro-economic policy, are unlikely to yield the anticipated results.
 Even those transitions which are apparently confined to economic activities within a stable political context necessarily depend on changes in social attitudes and in social institutions which can be dealt with most effectively by assuming a wider perspective of the process.
 Clear visualization of the before and after states of transition, the existing system, the goals to be sought after, and a detailed picture of the changes that need to occur in behaviour, attitudes and institutions are necessary for deriving the most effective transition strategies.
 With the knowledge the world possesses today, with the example of many successful nations over the last four decades, and with its highly educated and motivated people, surely the nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia can abridge the time required and the hardship of lessons learned by trial and error to a few years.
 But this cannot be accomplished by sweeping remedies or hastened by over-eagerness or impatience.
 It will require application of a profound understanding of the process of development and transition.
 We believe that a properly conceived effort to draw on the best available knowledge and experience of other countries can generate a transition strategy that avoids the dangers and pitfalls of the initial approach to reform and puts in place the essential foundations for the new system to function effectively and generate benefits for the people before the dawn of the new century.

 We sat in silence for several seconds as I tried to process how that new piece of information fit in with everything else I already knew.
 The obvious, if somewhat selfish, implication was that maybe it really was possible for someone like Alec to want to be with someone like me.
 There were plenty of other things to think about though.
 "Wow, is that hard?
 I mean living with people who can do all those things?"
 Rachel's shrug was surprisingly sincere.
 "It was a bit at first, especially right after Alec first started manifesting.
 Okay, maybe I was crazy jealous then, and again a couple of years later when it became apparent I wasn't going to manifest anything, but I got over it."

She looked up at him in surprise, and with a hint of fear.
 Rodregas raised his hand up in a peaceful motion.
 She probably had nowhere else to go.
 He ignored her and went to the cabinets and the cold box.
 He got out cheese and bread, found some fruit and had a good simple meal.
 He would need to pack as much food as possible for his journey.
 The old kitchen drudge was still peeling the same potato when he left the kitchen.
 Freshly fed and feeling better for it, Rodregas went across the main hall and entered the door opposite the kitchen into the barracks section of the keep.

The nineteenth century tolerated values based on the exploitation by people over people through slavery, colonialism and war, and the domination of nature by man.
 The guiding values for the coming century are freedom and respect for the individual, social equity, tolerance of human diversity and harmony with the environment.
 Development is widely regarded as the cause of moral decline and increasing corruption, crime and violence.
 These negative consequences are primarily due to the fact that freedom has been extended to vast sections of the population which were confined in the past by rigid social barriers and minimum expectations, so they never had need or occasion to embrace the values they now eschew.
 The earlier self-restraint has been replaced by a self-assertion that has not yet acquired the productive values needed for achievement.
 Rising expectations enhance this tendency.
 While it is true that corruption is more prevalent today than ever before, it is also true that the entire global economy functions on the basis of a faith, honesty, openness and tolerance that would have been inconceivable in the past.
 We mourn the loss of cloistered values, which were very often accompanied by narrow rigidity and provincialism, while failing to recognize the enormous growth in positive human values that has made possible the incredible progress of the past few decades.
 In past centuries cultural values were handed down to future generations through the family.
 Education, which now focuses on the transfer of information, ideas and mental skills, can also impart development-oriented values such as open-mindedness, initiative and innovation.

I actually couldn't have been happier.
 This was the first section where I'd been in a position to sit for the exam with everyone else.
 Our lecture essentially consisted of an extended review, which I quickly realized I didn't need.
 I broke out my book and started in on one of my catch-up assignments instead.
 At the rate I was going I'd be able to take my makeup exam way ahead of schedule.
 It was a pretty lame thing to be excited about, but just having something going well for a change helped compensate for the rest of my life.
 Amazingly enough, the satisfaction from having accomplished so much shielded me for most of the rest of the day.
 I withstood Britney's varied, mostly unsubtle, attempts to make me feel guilty for not spilling my guts about whatever big secret she thought I had, and even held up through the complete boredom that was Mr. Simms' class.
 It wasn't until I walked into Physics that I felt the cold hand of reality reach out and caress the back of my neck.

The answer fell out of my mouth of its own accord.
 It took me several seconds to realize it was the truth.
 I didn't have a ride home until Britney finished up her regular studying stint.
 "For Britney?
 Do you want us to give you a ride home?"
 A slight movement, barely seen out of the corner of my eye, gave meaning to the last part of the sentence.
 A familiar-looking guy was standing a few feet from Rachel.
 I couldn't place him.
 I slowly shook my head, trying to jar something loose enough to figure out who he was.

I was perfectly happy with the way everything was right now until I saw the small outline of a toad dwarf nearby.
 ‚ÄúUh Seth I don't think this is the best time to mention this but I think we have company.‚Äù I pointed to the shape.
 He swore under his breath, and we both entered the dwarf's world together.
 Sure enough, it was a dwarf but there was something strangely different about this particular dwarf.
 He just walked toward us as if he wasn't afraid that I might put an arrow through his head.
 Just as I was about to release my arrow, the dwarf cried, ‚ÄúPlease stop!‚Äù I don‚Äôt know why I listened to him but I didn‚Äôt pull the string.
 The dwarf was acting different than the others; its pudgy eyes were filled with fear at the sight of my arrow.
 ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Seth growled.
 ‚ÄúYour kind has done nothing good to us except make us confused and our lives more complicated.‚Äù The dwarf looked startled.
 ‚ÄúOh you‚Äôll have to excuse my brethren; they have a tendency to be rather annoying.‚Äù He took a long frightened look at Seth‚Äôs sword.

A word of power sent them flying.
 The elf dropped low, his right leg stretching back as he crouched.
 The bone fragments flew over his head, faster than arrows.
 Then he was up, his bow in hand.
 The string vanished from the bow, spikes pierced the front, and out came the long blades at each side.
 ‚ÄúYou foolish mortal,‚Äù Velixar said.
 His voice was far deeper than before, less like a man and more like a demon.
 ‚ÄúI do not fear your steel.‚Äù
 Pale hands shot upward, hooked in strange formations.
 Dieredon stabbed a long blade straight at the man‚Äôs throat.

We were an oddity in the sixties to almost everyone we met.
 Other parents would question us when we visited our friend‚Äôs homes, extracting information that we were ignorant enough to share and which likely hit the gossip circuit immediately.
 The other mothers were threatened by our mother, as she was beautiful and divorced!
 I would later realize how poorly my mother was treated by other mothers, and how she endured many unwanted sexual advances and groping by their spouses and her employers.
 It was the sixties, and my mother was damaged goods in their eyes; she was vulnerable.
 We eventually moved out of my grandparents‚Äô home to an apartment in Los Angeles and then to a small rental house in Burbank that backed up to a military plant.
 Barrels of who-knows-what lined the side of our back fence.
 I guess the rent is cheaper when you live next to a toxic dump!
 We had a yard for our dogs and new friends to meet and we settled into this little house.

Many elves will be lurking inside the woods as they hunt for the Forest Butcher.‚Äù Again Qurrah chuckled at the name his brother had earned.
 ‚ÄúWill we stop for a while?‚Äù Harruq asked.
 The smaller half-orc shook his head.
 ‚ÄúOf course not.
 I must keep learning, increasing my strength.
 We will resume, just this time amid the darkness.‚Äù
 Harruq nodded, obviously uneasy.
 ‚ÄúHey brother?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYes Harruq?‚Äù

 How many died to better your miserable excuse of a life?‚Äù
 Another twist.
 Qurrah leaned forward, clutching at his tormenter‚Äôs shaking hands.
 Words spilled from the half-orc‚Äôs mouth, garbled and nearly unintelligible.
 ‚ÄúWhat is it you wish to say to me?‚Äù the elf asked, ignoring the flailing hands that pawed at his face.
 ‚Äú _Hemorrhage,_ ‚Äù the half-orc hissed.
 The elf‚Äôs face exploded.
 Qurrah fell over onto his side, breathing as slowly as he could through the blood that filled his throat.
 The dead body of the elf crumpled in front of him, all of his hate-filled features gone from his face except for a single eye.

The market system ‚Äì basing itself on property rights and self-determined initiatives of the individual producer and consumer ‚Äì is an economic expression of the same principle.
 Both democracy and market-oriented economies decentralize authority and decision making, providing the essential legal and regulatory framework and empowering the individual to choose and act with minimum direction or interference from above.
 Both depend for their success on the quality of those choices, which means on the quality of education and information possessed by the mass of people, and on the freedom and dynamism of the population.
 In contrast, authoritarian systems and command economies centralize decision making, restrict the flow of information to the public, foster vast unresponsive bureaucracies, limit individual freedom and initiative within narrow bounds, and encourage obedience and conformity rather than innovation.
 The spread of education, which fosters independent thinking, and dissemination of information through the media were important factors in undermining public acceptance of communism in Eastern Europe.
 In a real sense, it was Gorbachev‚Äôs policy of glasnost that brought down the Iron Curtain.
 It opened up an insular society and exposed it to an avalanche of new information, new ideas and new possibilities, which released a fervent aspiration in the people for a better life.
 Over the last few years, democratization has been especially dynamic in Africa, where it has been dubbed Africa‚Äôs Second Liberation.
 During the first three decades of post-colonial independence, almost all of the continent‚Äôs 54 states had come under either single-party or military rule.
 The preference for authoritarian rule was often justified by the need for rapid economic development, which could be impeded by opposition to government policies and by the need to contain regional and tribal conflicts.

She seemed more than happy to comply and I was in no doubt we would be training again.

 ‚ÄúWant me to carry anything?‚Äù She eyed me as if I was entirely absurd.
 ‚ÄúWell, if you would like to, I can find something for you.‚Äù I glared at her back and she turned to grab my arm beneath the cloak, yanking me behind her as we left the house through her closet.
 She replaced the cover that hid the entrance and snatched a quiver of arrows from the ground before pulling me forward again.
 ‚ÄúWhat are those for?‚Äù I asked, indicating the arrows, afraid they would somehow be used in my training.
 ‚ÄúThey are arrows, Frey.‚Äù She was really on a roll today, a delightful mood.

 He still couldn't believe that this had happened.
 He didn't believe in extraterrestrials, he didn't believe in ghosts, and he certainly didn't believe that people could travel through time.
 But here she was.
 His mind reeled with the implications and unreality of it all.
 And the emotion that permeated his jumbled thoughts was guilt.
 He'd been preoccupied with thoughts of Marie ever since he'd seen her picture.
 Was it possible that his thoughts had somehow brought her here?

‚ÄúStay down,‚Äù Harruq said.
 He retrieved Salvation and Condemnation from the dirt, and then stomped over to the beaten, bloody elf warrior.
 ‚ÄúMercy, I am beaten,‚Äù the elf gasped as Harruq lifted his head by the hair.
 ‚ÄúNo such thing,‚Äù he said.
 Salvation tore out his throat.
 Condemnation hacked off his head.
 He sheathed his blades, breathed in deeply, and then let it all out in an ecstatic, primal cry.
 As the last of it left his lips, he saw an elf‚Äôs shocked walnut eyes from a nearby alley.

‚ÄúThen perhaps you could find a way around it.‚Äù I bit my lip and he reached up to gently pull it loose.
 His hand lingered, thumb tracing my bottom lip.
 I was definitely not imagining that.
 Warmth flooded my neck, my cheeks, and his gaze followed the flush.
 His hand dropped to my shoulder.
 ‚ÄúPlease, Freya, try.‚Äù All I could do was nod.
 And then he stood and walked away.
 I sat unmoving for a moment, and then finally glanced at the group.
 They were deeply involved in their conversations, seemingly unaware of the encounter that had my heart in my throat.
 I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, attempting to ‚Äúmove about‚Äù in my mind.

The four walls of the room seemed to be set back with the ceiling gently coming down in the form of great arches.
 In one of the great arches was the door they had entered.
 The stone around the door was the gray of the local granite.
 The three others had black featureless stone that Rodregas did not recognize.
 As he followed Doi‚Äôvan into the shadows of the distant arch Rodregas smelled what had attracted Doi‚Äôvan, the odor of brimstone and hellfire.
 Rodregas stepped back in shock; what was that smell of the Infernal Realm doing here in the Cathedral of the Heavens?
 Doi‚Äôvan however, did not step back but stepped forward, reaching out to the stone.
 When he touched it, suddenly there was a doorway.
 It was the twin of the main entrance, except here there were no guards.
 Doi‚Äôvan reached for the long handle, but Rodregas quickly said, ‚ÄúStop!‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan looked back at him and Rodregas could see that he was under no magical geis controlling his will, just curiosity of what the source of the Infernal smell was down here.

I'd be out of the state before she really got busy making my life miserable.
 A dozen different things I could say blew through my mind, but they were all competing, and none of them fit the situation.
 In typical fashion, I found myself without anything clever to say.
 Instead I just stood there and stared at Cassie.
 I'd thought things were tense already, but where everyone had been quiet before, now they were motionless too.
 Cassie spun around and glared at me.
 "Take off."
 I shook my head and clenched my fists a little tighter.
 "Leave her alone."
 For a second I thought Cassie would go through with it.

The number of single-party or military states and people under autocratic rule has fallen dramatically since 1980, and the trend continues.
 This shift to multi-party democracy, when coupled with a free press and an independent judiciary, vastly reduces the threat of large-scale wars similar to those that have twice shaken the world in this century.
 Three factors are at play in most conflict situations: the absence of developed democratic institutions, the absence or abuse of fundamental human rights, and the inability to make those choices in the management of public policy on which good governance depends.
 Authoritarian governments find justification for their existence in the presence of external threats to national security, in times of war and during periods of imperialist expansionism.
 They have a vested interest in maintaining a state of tension or initiating conflicts.
 In contrast, empirical evidence shows that liberal democracies do not go to war against one another.
 A study by Dean V. Babst of 116 major wars from 1789 to 1941 revealed that ‚Äòno wars have been fought between independent nations with elective governments‚Äô.
 The reasons for this are several.
 Democracies tend to be more prosperous and better educated.
 They share common political cultures based on individual rights and liberties.

What does Kojas want?‚Äù The dwarf seemed to be getting extremely excited now, ‚ÄúHe wants your world and all other worlds because he is a mighty king who wishes to expand his kingdom.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo how would we help him do that?‚Äù I asked, stalling.
 ‚ÄúWe just exterminate the pests.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a half-ling!
 You‚Äôre the bridge to our world.
 Now if you don‚Äôt mind we would like to finish you now, and bring you to the King.‚Äù The dwarf said politely and snickered, approaching me.
 I backed up slowly.
 ‚ÄúUh, I mind a lot actually.‚Äù I said quickly but I guess they didn‚Äôt really want my opinion.
 Emily jumped out from behind the trees and lifted a flame.
 She twirled it around with the movement of her hands and shot it at the nearest dwarf.
 That started what seemed like a war.

We ought to get excited about changes.
 You, for instance, you ought to jump at the chance to go to Pepperdine.‚Äù Though I only remember my mom going to church for funerals, or as far as the front door to pick up a free copy of the Christian Science Monitor, her preference for my education was Pepperdine, a Christian college.
 I suppose she hoped I might find guidance there.
 ‚ÄúIn L.A., Ken.
 You could learn to write movies, and still get home in a couple hours if your mom needs you.
 But you don‚Äôt want to go.‚Äù ‚ÄúState College is almost free.

It‚Äôs almost 1:30 in the morning, and I would like to get home before my dad wakes himself up,‚Äù Emily said, and walked towards her house.
 I waved quickly and followed.
 The rest of the night was quiet and didn‚Äôt include singing dwarfs.
 Before we went to bed though there was a lot of furious writing as Emily tried to write everything down.
 After that, was all sleep.
 In the morning, we ate pancakes that Emily‚Äôs mom had made us and set off for the park.
 We happened to run into Jason and Seth half way and at the same time watched a pole freeze in the middle of July.
 You don‚Äôt get to see that every day, which usually meant there was a monster involved.
 Jason, Seth and Emily saw it too because I was chasing after them as we all ran for the few trees ahead.
 In a few seconds I had a complete view of the culprit.

She could draw her own conclusions about what the change in the article meant.
 Excited, he stood and headed for her room.
 But when he reached her door, he hesitated.
 Would she believe him about the article?
 She still felt loyal to that jerk, and she might not believe him.
 Especially since it was pretty obvious that he himself had something to gain by convincing her that she shouldn‚Äôt marry Davis.
 His sister had once told him that a girl usually wouldn‚Äôt even believe her best friend if she told her that her boyfriend was cheating on her.
 He went back to his office and read the article again.
 He should have shown it to Marie before he‚Äôd fallen in love with her.

Rodregas was used to the rough humor of soldiers and let such jokes roll off.
 The night came when the father was taken for the ceremony.
 Rodregas was on guard duty when Korin came down in his new body.
 The poor lad had stared at the man who had been his father, saying nothing, but tears ran down his cheeks.
 The apprentice Immortalist had then proceeded to rape the mother.
 The Adapt was rough and the act was violent and Korin, in his new body, clearly enjoyed the violence more than the sex.
 After he had finished with the mother, he had the guards release the boy who had run over to his sobbing bleeding mother.
 In a fatherly gesture Korin had kissed the boy on the cheek and, wrapping his hands around the boy‚Äôs head in a slow loving gesture, made a quick yank and broke Join‚Äôs neck.
 The next day the guards released the young AElfin widow.
 Rodregas had helped drag her beyond the gates.

As dire as his situation seemed, he could honestly say he had been in worse shape before and survived.
 Three times, even.
 Then his ears heard what he had feared: something walking directly behind him.
 The others might not see him, but seeing wouldn‚Äôt be necessary if one stumbled directly atop his prone body.
 His good hand fingered the bow pinned beneath him.
 If discovered, he would die fighting.
 The footsteps neared.
 A clacking sound haunted his hearing.
 It rattled sporadically, and it was most certainly bone hitting bone.
 He imagined a loose jaw hanging by only one side, or perhaps a hand held by a thread of flesh banging against a rotted femur.

 Harruq dropped the dead elf and lashed out.
 His backhand broke the elf‚Äôs jaw.
 Reeling, the elf staggered back, only able to raise his meager arm above his head.
 Harruq smashed an elbow into his chest, followed by knuckled fists atop his skull.
 ‚ÄúStay down,‚Äù Harruq said.
 He retrieved Salvation and Condemnation from the dirt, and then stomped over to the beaten, bloody elf warrior.
 ‚ÄúMercy, I am beaten,‚Äù the elf gasped as Harruq lifted his head by the hair.
 ‚ÄúNo such thing,‚Äù he said.

Conditions vary too widely from country to country for detailed recommendations to be broadly applied.
 However, a number of strategies are relevant to the majority of developing countries.
 Some of the components of an Action Plan designed to achieve this goal are given below.
 1.Elimination of agricultural trade barriers by industrial nations.
 The agreements reached for liberalizing agricultural trade in the Uruguay Round of GATT are an important step forward, but they will not release the full dynamism of the agricultural sector, which is so critical for more rapid growth of incomes and employment in both developing and developed countries.
 In the previous chapter, we have called for rapid reduction leading to a complete elimination of agricultural subsidies and other trade barriers by industrial nations, which can generate a positive multiplier effect.
 It has been estimated that complete liberalization of trade in agricultural commodities would yield an annual gain (in 1992 dollars) of about $25 billion for OECD countries and $22 billion for developing and formerly centrally planned countries.
 Actual gains could be very much higher.
 These subsidies cost Western consumers several hundred billion dollars annually.
 In addition, they lead to dumping of surplus sugar, cereal, milk and beef in developing countries, often pushing down the prices which farmers in these countries receive for their produce to far below their production cost.

When I didn‚Äôt reply, she covered her mouth with her hand to try to cover her chuckles.
 ‚ÄúOh then,‚Äù she giggled, ‚ÄúI hope you two had a nice chat.‚Äù ‚ÄúStop it Emily!‚Äù I snapped and felt my face burn.
 She snickered.
 ‚ÄúOkay whatever you say, Jazell.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have to tell you guys something,‚Äù I told her and Jason about how the dwarf had showed up and what he said about Igneeria.

Though I didn‚Äôt understand at the time, I was asking if they felt the darkness in their nature, the affinity for sin.
 Somewhere, I read, "All sin is the result of the failure to love."
 Over lots of years, I have noted voluminous evidence for that idea, and not a shred against it.
 My last summer in Chico, I was sorely depressed, living too far from my family and confused about most everything.
 And I discovered the best I could do to relieve depression was turn my thoughts and concerns from myself to others.
 Even the feeling like a rock in my belly went away.
 Love heals.
 Along with The Practice of the Presence of God and some mysteries, I have been reading about Feodor Dostoyevski's philosophical positions, because the issues he tackled a century and a half ago are still remarkably current.
 In Dostoyevski the Thinker, I discovered a passage written following the death of his first wife.
 Since I have the book with me, I pull into a turnout overlooking the Pacific, find the passage and reread it.

 ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù he mumbled and hurried off.
 Accompanied by a young man scribbling on a sheet of parchment, Alvrik sat at a small table in front of a group of people waiting in line to address him.
 Harruq slipped into the back and tried to calm down.
 Never before had he done anything like this.
 He had stolen food, fled from guards, lived in poverty, and kept to himself.
 For he and his brother, that was life.

I opened my mouth, maybe to laugh the comment off, or otherwise hedge my bets against the humiliation and inevitable mocking laughter.
 Whatever it was I'd intended on saying evaporated away the instant he reached out and slowly slid his finger down the side of my face.
 The tiny part of me that was still screaming none of this could be real was pulled along by the rest of me.
 I completely abandoned myself to the sensations created by his touch.
 My nerve endings didn't know whether to classify his finger as icy cold or scorching hot, but before I could recoil in pain the sensation gave way to a tingly warmth that sank down into my center, simultaneously tightening and relaxing parts I didn't even know I had.
 My pounding heart seemed loud enough to hear from across the street.
 I opened my eyes, afraid he could somehow hear the overworked muscle, already flushing red with embarrassment, only to find a gentle smile waiting for me.
 If there was any insincerity to the expression, I was utterly unable to detect it.
 I cleared my throat, seeking to avoid the awkwardness that always followed these kinds of moments, but Brandon effortlessly defused all of that by opening my door and helping me into the car.

Was she really that scared of him?
 I stole a glance at him out of the corner of my eye.
 He didn't look threatening, well, at least no more so than usual.
 Anyone with that many muscles was at least a little threatening.
 But he was just sitting there casually, driving along, seemingly without a care in the world.
 In fact, he wasn't buckled in either.
 "Isn't that a bit hypocritical?
 I mean you tell her to buckle up, but you're not buckled up yourself."
 Alec shrugged.

 A single word can change our lives.
 Some years ago, I began to think hard about the word "love" as in "God is love" and in a challenge Sylvia Curtis made.
 Sylvia was an invalid, and rather crazy, given to dark moods and paranoid notions.
 She was the mother of my best friend Eric.
 I had come to help with chores and listen to her rant about whatever injustices she had recently suffered.
 Her apartment was dingy and cluttered, mostly with books.

 Quite impressive really.
 He didn‚Äôt even seem to be watching, let alone concentrating.
 And no blessings on it, no thanks to Mother Earth.
 It seemed he was just enjoying himself, not being responsible to the magic.

"Almost?"
 He stopped, turning to face her.
 They were in the dappled shadows of early blossoms, and he drew her into his arms to kiss her gently.
 Marie's heart pounded as she kissed him back.
 His kisses were rare, so she savored each one, clinging to him and hoping that it would go on forever.
 But he ended this one all too soon, raising his head to gaze down into her sparkling eyes.
 "I love you," he whispered, pressing his lips to her forehead.
 Those words were even rarer than his kisses; she'd heard them only twice before.
 "I love you too, Davis."
 Caught up in the evening's enchantment, she gazed up into his eyes, hoping he'd kiss her again.

 ‚ÄúMaybe we should see what your strong suit is,‚Äù she said and motioned me to follow her as she walked to the rock ridge and jumped over, hurrying down to the men.
 ‚ÄúSorry to interrupt, gentlemen,‚Äù she announced.
 ‚ÄúI was wondering if you‚Äôd mind a little demonstration?‚Äù They broke their circle to give her their attention.
 ‚ÄúFrey here hasn‚Äôt found her rhythm yet,‚Äù she explained.
 They seemed to understand and she bounded back over to me and drew me to sit beside her on a large rock facing the men before cueing them to begin.
 The largest stepped forward, boasting deep brown hair and eyes.
 He wore plain clothing but his broad shoulders and massive size made him seem regal.
 ‚ÄúThey name me Anvil but I am Reed, of Keithar Peak.‚Äù His voice was thick, though it was impossible to tell whether it was an accent or he had difficulty speaking.
 He was huge, frighteningly so, but something about him drew me in.

"Marie?"
 Rick called as he searched the house for her.
 She wasn't in the living room or kitchen.
 He went upstairs and looked in her bedroom.
 Where else could she be?
 "Marie?"
 He finally went out to the garden.
 She was way over by the pink roses, and he was surprised and dismayed to see her wearing her 1927 clothes.
 "Marie!"
 He ran over to her, but something about her stance when she looked up at him kept him from sweeping her into his arms like he wanted.

Teachers were a little harder, but if you didn't have the help of your 'friends', then they became an insurmountable obstacle.
 The gears finally ground to a stop and Britney sighed as she put her head down on the table.
 I tried to stop from smiling at her theatrics, but happened to look over at Rachel just in time to see a matching smile on the younger girl's face.
 Before I could look away, Rachel held up the red side of her card.
 "Do you have a minute?"
 Happy to be able to do something, I hurried over and took a look at her open book.
 "Fractions, huh?"
 "Yeah, I'm supposed to reduce them after I finish adding, but I can't seem to get to the same answer as the book on this one."
 She'd transposed a couple of the numbers when working on one of the intermediate steps.
 "Here it is, you've changed the numbers here, it should be fourteen sixty-fifths, not fourteen fifty-sixths."

The sound of her tromping up the stairs finally roused me from my state of shock.
 "I'm in my room, Mom."
 Apparently the sound of my voice was at least slightly reassuring, she was only a little wild-eyed by the time she opened the door and stuck her head in my room.
 "Oh, there you are, dear.
 I was worried you were gone."
 I forced a chuckle.
 "Please, Mom.
 Where else would I be?

She only spoke a few minutes, yet three times she asked that we pray for the MCs and the poorest of the poor.
 I joined the receiving line.
 As those of us standing went first, it only took a few minutes, during which I received the clarity to recognize that God, the source of all power, only works through people who stand aside and let him.
 Mother Teresa has built a mighty force of little, brown, meek, powerful women, because she knows and practices the art of humility, as perfectly as anyone I've witnessed.
 Her ego vanishes.
 God fills the vacuum.
 One of her warm hands touched mine and the other pressed my forehead.
 She smiled as poignantly as though I were her son, and her greatness revealed itself instantly.
 Because I realized that although she earned a Nobel prize and is frequently called a living Saint, she considers herself no better than me.
 Talk about humility.

Aurelia and Qurrah shared a quick, knowing smile.
 The frail half-orc‚Äôs face lost much of its lifelessness, and a gentle caring filled his eyes.
 His seriousness quickly buried it, but Aurelia had seen enough.
 ‚ÄúI shall leave you two to your studies and sparring,‚Äù Qurrah said after a long pause to torture Harruq.
 ‚ÄúAlthough I doubt the wisdom of leaving him alone with such a beautiful teacher.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúGood thing you will not have to worry about that, considering I see no beautiful teachers around,‚Äù Aurelia replied.
 Qurrah walked to Aurelia and bowed again, taking her hand in his and kissing it.
 As Aurelia smiled, he rose and whispered into her ear.
 ‚ÄúHe loves you, elf.
 I can feel it.

 Whatever had been there lived a little like the imps.
 And there were imp tracks there, but it appeared only one.
 A massive numbers of bowls and jars littered the camp.
 I have no idea who would need so many.
 The fairies like containers, but not of this crude sort‚Äîthe craftsmanship was almost that of a troll.
 I tried to stay on the opposite side of the camp from my sister‚Äôs wrath, but I found tracks and had to follow them near her, stirring up another fit of rage.
 The prints were shoed, about the size of elves, but the treads were irregular.
 Whatever stayed here, there were a lot of them.

Wish-granting fairies somewhere were working overtime, because as Brandon turned off the engine, I saw a mob of people over by one of the smaller entrances to the school.
 "Wow, I wonder what's going on over there."
 We were both out of the car now, and it seemed the most natural thing in the world to grab Brandon's arm and tug him over to the crowd.
 It wasn't until I felt the iron-hard muscles under my now-tingling hand that I realized what I'd done.
 I felt a surge of heat wash over my face and neck.
 Brandon for once didn't have an easy comeback to defuse the awkwardness.
 If anything he looked slightly uncomfortable himself.
 "I'm sure it's nothing important..." He trailed off as my traitorous hand found his arm of its own accord and started pulling again.
 I wasn't sure why I was so anxious; usually I avoided crowds like the plague.
 Maybe I was just trying to prolong our time together.

I'm better at seeing God in the sorrow of a destitute fellow, one of those folks Hank Williams called "men with broken hearts", or in the patient nod of a sales clerk as I decide whether to buy a magazine, or in a woman's kind smile.
 When I need a break from work or chores, and sometimes while reading or praying, I sit on the back porch like my mom used to do.
 The view was the reason she gave for not selling the house after I left home.
 As I sit and gaze toward the Mexican border, I think of Eric, and how we used to peer through twilight and try to locate his home in the valley about five miles closer to Mexico.
 Which reminds me of Sylvia and how the cruelty of the world drove her crazy, and I wonder if turning to Jesus might have cured her, if she had let him expel her bitterness.
 Because for those who fail to discover peace and even joy in the midst of the cruelty, going mad is only sensible.
 I imagine Eric sitting beside me, wearing the same face as after he pinned me to his living room floor, just before he coached me to believe in myself no matter the evidence that I was a loser.
 Then the expression changes to the one I imagine him wearing when he told Kenny they needed to leave for the desert without Billy and me.
 I get a crazy idea I have never considered before.
 Because Eric and Olga would have loved each other, I bring Olga out of the air and onto the lounge chair beside Eric.

He had an old torn jacket on with a beanie on his head.
 He was unshaven and looked the part of a vagrant.
 We had a moment of eye contact and he had no expression as if he didn‚Äôt know me at all.
 It was a slight reassurance but I still wondered where the rest of them were and how they would get to me quick if things went to Hell.
 I received another call from the officer and he had me speak so they could tune in the wire.
 He said that they needed to occasionally check the wire‚Äîfrom time to time I should say something to reassure them that they‚Äôd end up with a quality recording of the deal.
 The crack-berry rang and it was Ashley.
 She said her friend was reluctant to come to where I was because I was in a county where they were tough on crime and she wanted me to drive a couple of miles away and meet them at a grocery store.

For a second I couldn't even think.
 He'd just used the 'L-word', and my heart felt like it was tearing itself apart inside my chest.
 In the subtle shadings we girls used to measure commitment, it wasn't as good as if he'd come right out and said, 'I love you Adriana Paige', but it was still pretty good, and it was a complete first for me.
 Once I made it past the second part of his statement, I was able to start considering the first part of what he'd said.
 It was horrifying and amazing all at once, and it made complete sense.
 His mom was living in memories because the real world was just a pale shadow of her life with his father.
 Alec seemed to take my silence as condemnation, or possibly just agreement with his self-condemnation.
 "We're where the legends of succubi originated.
 Irresistible demons who drain their victims dry, who leave their lovers a hollow shell of what they were before."
 I'd finally worked through things enough inside my mind, to respond, but he bulldozed right over me.

He drank in her smell.
 Like her it was unique, something between a honey blossom and a ripe apple.
 Like many things in life since he left Raven Keep, he cherished the feel, the taste, and the smell.
 Then she broke away and whispered, ‚ÄúI am afraid.‚Äù Imeralda spoke so quietly that he could barely hear.
 ‚ÄúI want to,‚Äù she paused and then continued her light whisper, ‚ÄúBut being a half Nymph, half AElf means it is not easy to become involved with for a human.
 I don‚Äôt want to hurt you.‚Äù He missed her taste as she pulled away, and he was surprised by what she said, but he also knew that he no longer wanted to live in fear.
 ‚ÄúShhhhh, it is all right.
 With me you never have to worry, you never have to be afraid.‚Äù He was going to tell her that he would not hurt her, but since she seemed afraid that she would be the one hurting him, he held the comment back.
 He just pulled her close again, but instead of a soft kiss he kept himself from touching her and simply looked deep into her eyes and thought about how much he appreciated her.
 Rodregas let her feel how much he thought of her.

Alec appeared around the corner, followed by Isaac, just a split second before Brandon sauntered into view from the opposite direction.
 The tingly feeling grew exponentially more powerful with so many more shape shifters present.
 Rubbing my arms did nothing to ward off the feeling that entire colonies of insects were skittering across my skin.
 Mr. Rindell's appearance forestalled what I'd been sure would turn into a full-blown fight.
 He sized up the situation with the canny eye of an educator who'd seen more fights over his career than most gang leaders.
 "Class is about to start, and if every one of you isn't where you're supposed to be before the bell rings, you'll have detention for the next month."
 Vincent's hiss was still almost inaudible.
 "This isn't over."
 I felt my knees almost collapse as the two packs slowly backed away from each other, and Jasmin joined me inside the classroom.
 Mrs. Campbell gave the two of us a considering look after reading Jasmin's note, but sent us off to a pair of empty seats at the back of the classroom without comment.

Income inequalities are increasing rapidly, even between developing countries.
 More than 60 countries are unable to meet their debt obligations.
 Many are facing depressed prices for primary commodities, upon which they rely for their export earnings and debt servicing.
 Economic collapse in Eastern Europe: The enormous spread and depth of economic decline among the former communist countries of Eastern Europe during the period 1990‚Äì3 exceeds in magnitude the catastrophe that engulfed the capitalist economies during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
 Falling production and incomes coupled with soaring prices are combining to cause political instability, social unrest and extreme hardship to the populations of these nations.
 If not remedied, this could result in a reversal of the remarkable progress towards world peace achieved during the past seven years.
 Arms exports: The cutting of defence budgets has generated increasing pressure on arms manufacturers to seek export markets.
 Although the value (in 1992 US dollars) of arms exports fell by more than 50 per cent from 1988 to 1992, it still represents nearly $20 billion annually.
 These weapons, over 80 per cent of which are supplied by the five permanent members of the Security Council, directly contribute to the growing instability and violence.
 During the last decade, 40 per cent of these weapons were sold to trouble spots such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Sudan.

 Shit, I still have that little radio‚ÄîI kept it because it seemed important.

 Of course, by this time, I was making my own music, fixing to go out on my own, and, in a way, I saw Dylan as a map, as a way out into the world.
 What more can we ask of art, right?
 Later, when I met him, I talked to him about this and he was, well, flattered, I guess, and he talked about how Guthrie and Leadbelly were like that for him.
 All these memories collide in my head to form a capharnaum around what I want to know more concretely: how did Bob Dylan become important to me?
 And the process must have been gradual, an accretion, Bob Dylan never became, for me, what James Joyce was for Richard Ellmann, or to use a less pretentious comparison, what hamburgers were for Wimpy.

 All at once he remembered the article about Marie.
 He dug it out of the bottom drawer of his desk and read it again.
 All it contained was her birth date and the general information about her family.
 He wished the information about her marriage to Davis hadn‚Äôt disappeared.
 He could have shown her what her life would be like if she married him.
 But why couldn‚Äôt he just tell her what the article had said originally?
 She could draw her own conclusions about what the change in the article meant.
 Excited, he stood and headed for her room.
 But when he reached her door, he hesitated.

‚ÄúAll right, Sir Paladin, I have to admit I have talked to the Sorcerer Ravenhurr a few too many times, and you definitely don‚Äôt seem to be him.
 Nevertheless, we are taking your wagon and your supplies.

 ‚ÄúHand over the shorts swords,‚Äù Audrian continued, gesturing at the two blades that Rodregas had yet to pull.
 ‚ÄúWe will return one in the morning.‚Äù Rodregas smiled and nodded and pulled the two swords out simultaneously.
 He was starting to think his new body was ambidextrous, equally comfortable with both hands.
 That could prove useful, but would require some additional training to take full advantage of.
 ‚ÄúActually, since I was kicking your ass barehanded, even with a knife in my belly, how about this: I won‚Äôt kill the bunch of you if you keep your distance and leave my camp at first light?‚Äù Rodregas‚Äô tone was casual.
 ‚ÄúAnd, if you ask nicely, I will even leave you a few supplies to get to the nearest town if you promise not to tell anyone that you saw me.
 And you will promise that in the name of the All-Father, or you will die at my hand.‚Äù Rodregas did not smile now, nor did they.

Brandon was inconsolable.
 His best friend was dead.
 Brandon blamed himself for not being there to take care of Tom.
 One of Brandon‚Äôs confessions during rehab was that almost all of his friends decided to get as high as they could to attend Tom‚Äôs funeral.
 It was the beginning of his excessive drug abuse.
 Chapter 24: Let The Healing Begin As Brandon approached his fifth month as a student at Narconon, he called us and told us he was nearing graduation from the program.
 He also told us he had applied for an internship at the facility and that he wanted to become a drug counselor.
 Brandon told us he wanted to give back and stay on to help others and told us how much better equipped he felt to deal with the world which surrounds us all, but silently haunts a select few.
 The counselors at Narconon had such a profound impact on him that he wanted to have the same impact on others.
 We felt as though we were getting our son back!

 ‚ÄúAnd what is that, Qurrah?

Starting at his wrist, she rubbed his arm, working her way up.
 When she reached the tan line where his sleeve began, her hands glided up to the red spot just below his neck.
 "You-you must not have put sunscreen here.
 It's really red."
 He gazed at her averted face as she rubbed lotion on his chest.
 He was sure she could feel the pounding of his heart when her hands strayed from the sunburnt spot.
 Swallowing, he said hoarsely, "You like touching me, don't you?"
 Her eyes met his briefly and then returned to follow the action of her hands.
 "Yes," she whispered.
 Rick's arms slid around her waist, and he bent his head to kiss her.

Her knuckles went white, and her breathing sped up.
 I knew if she sprang at me, I was going to get really hurt.
 When Brandon's hand appeared on Cassie's shoulder to restrain her, I thought for a second my knees would buckle.
 A few seconds later, it was as if nothing had ever happened.
 The ring of spectators dissolved as kids quickly returned to their tables.
 Brandon and his friends left through one set of cafeteria doors, while Alec and his friends departed through the other.
 Britney looked like she was trying to decide whether to be mad or impressed, but I felt too sick to stick around and try to nudge her in either direction.
 I mumbled something I hoped sounded intelligible and headed towards the bathroom.
 I passed Mr. Simms and another teacher on my way out, but apparently I looked as awful as I felt.
 They just shot me stern looks rather than stopping me to ask what had happened.

A similar organization is presently lacking for most other crops.
 The successful establishment of more than one million Self-Help Groups (SHGs) in India over the past three years providing access to credit for 15 million small farmers illustrates the power of organization.
 It is an indication that the phase of society‚Äôs predominant dependence on government initiatives for development is coming to a close.
 An organization combining the advantages of SHGs and contract farming through the agency of an NGO or an agri-business centre operated by farm and home science graduates or entrepreneurs can be successfully extended to other crops, providing the technical knowledge and essential inputs that small farmers need to raise productivity and farm incomes.
 Crop Diversification: Eradicating hunger necessitates shifting production from traditional crops to higher value added crops that can improve nutrition, while generating higher on-farm incomes and greater off-farm employment.
 Fruits and vegetables can remove micro-nutrient deficiencies, while dairy and poultry can eliminate protein deficiencies.
 The soaring price of petroleum, which has reached historical highs this year, presents an additional opportunity for countries such as India to become large scale producers and exporters of bio-fuels and bio-mass energy, thereby substituting imported petroleum with lucrative markets, higher incomes and greater employment opportunities for the rural population.
 Contract farming arrangements between small producers and agri-business centres can stimulate rapid development of this field.
 Ethanol, bio-diesel and bio-mass power from agricultural produce could generate the equivalent of 15 million additional employment opportunities in India, while raising rural incomes by US $10 billion annually.
 Water Conservation: Improving access to safe drinking water requires a combination of public education and government action.

Dark magic poured in.
 Her arms and legs arched backward, her sword fell from her hand, and her mouth opened in a single, aching shriek.
 Bits of darkness flared from her mouth, her eyes, and her nostrils.
 Done, Velixar shoved her smoking body back into the alley and left her to die.
 When he turned, he snarled.
 Aurelia was gone.
 ‚ÄúYou have delayed me my kill,‚Äù he said to Felewen‚Äôs body.

 He placed his hood back over his head, pulled it down to cover his features, and then began his search for the sorceress.

Even as he was talking, Alec was moving towards the door.
 "There's really no need.
 I'm fine.
 I don't need to see the nurse."
 It was obvious he was going to ignore me.
 I tried to thrash around enough for him to put me down, but he restrained my arms with a couple of fingers.
 The motion was so casual I was pretty sure nobody even realized he'd pinned my arms to my stomach with surprising strength.
 I thought about kicking, or even screaming, but that would just leave me feeling like a child and give Alec exactly the kind of attention he was probably hoping for.

One person, he guessed, most likely an elf judging by the design of the building.
 Qurrah stood and readied his whip.
 He would not cower in hiding.
 This was his home now.
 He would defend it.
 ‚ÄúYou are not safe here,‚Äù Qurrah whispered.
 ‚ÄúFor if you are safe, then I am not.‚Äù
 He crept down the stairs, the whip coiled and ready to burst into flame.
 Before the circular front window stood an elf, one hand on the glass, the other holding a bow.
 Qurrah reached into his pocket, clutching a few pieces of bone.

And I discovered the best I could do to relieve depression was turn my thoughts and concerns from myself to others.
 Even the feeling like a rock in my belly went away.
 Love heals.
 Along with The Practice of the Presence of God and some mysteries, I have been reading about Feodor Dostoyevski's philosophical positions, because the issues he tackled a century and a half ago are still remarkably current.
 In Dostoyevski the Thinker, I discovered a passage written following the death of his first wife.
 Since I have the book with me, I pull into a turnout overlooking the Pacific, find the passage and reread it.
 "To love someone as oneself, in accordance with Christ's commandment, is impossible.
 The love of personality is binding on earth.
 The self stands in the way.
 Christ could do it, but Christ was an eternal ideal, toward which man strives and must strive, by the law of nature.

I felt a tingle of power as Mallory reached out and placed her hands on either side of his face.
 The power surged, and Alec's heavy, cool power was joined by something light and laughing.
 Several seconds later, Mallory released Alec with a sigh and fell back in obvious exhaustion.
 Alec watched intently until she shook her head, and then the mask fell for just a second before he locked it back in place, hiding the disappointment that for the slimmest of moments had been plainly written on his expression.
 Mallory reached out, as if to take Alec's hand, but he gently set her hands back on her lap.
 "Nothing's changed.
 We'll just proceed as before.
 Rest now, and should the worst come to pass I'll send Donovan to you."
 A few seconds later Alec and I were outside the cabin, walking back in the direction of the waiting motorcycle.
 I reached out to take his hand, and felt a glimmer of relief when he didn't reject the gesture as he had with Mallory.

I glanced over at her but she was still facing out the window.
 A moment later Chevelle walked in and she threw him a wicked grin, leaving us alone.
 I brushed the length of my hair forward, hoping to cover the heat that had risen to burn my neck and ears.
 ‚ÄúReady to resume training?‚Äù he asked.
 That cooled the flush and I grimaced, moving to stand.
 I hadn‚Äôt done so since the incident and my head spun.
 I wobbled, and Chevelle was suddenly there, steadying me.
 I shook off his look of concern.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.

 ‚ÄúI think I need to change shields,‚Äù he said.
 Doi‚Äôvan glanced at what remained of Rodregas‚Äô shield and simply nodded and handed him one of their other shields.
 It was not in great shape, but it was whole.
 Rodregas watched a few of the other matches before it was his turn again.
 Except for him, everyone remaining wore full plate.
 Rodregas‚Äô next opponent was shining in the sun in his steel; which was better than him having to face Night Bronze plate, but still not very reassuring.
 The flag fell and Rodregas dug his heals into Doom Hoof‚Äôs side and the mount plodded forward.
 His opponent‚Äôs horse looked almost as powerful, but much faster.
 The collision happened before Rodregas was fully expecting it and he felt himself hit the ground and hit it hard.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù asked Imeralda, ‚Äúwhere are we going?
 I assume it is not the Northern Kingdoms as you said to Audrian.
 For one thing that would be stupid, and for a second you seem to be climbing ever higher into the Arida Mountains and that is hardly the best way north.‚Äù Rodregas nodded.
 He hoped to make it to his hideaway by nightfall, so he decided it did not hurt to share his plan at this point.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right; we are not going to the Northern Kingdoms.
 A few companions and I were hiding out in the Aridas and in one of the higher hollows I found an old farmhouse.
 It has been abandoned for a long time, but it is well made and there is water and lots of fruit trees and berry bushes that must be left over from an old orchard.‚Äù After a moment he added, ‚ÄúI always thought that if I ever needed a place to hide out that it was ideal.
 Of course it will be rough there.
 Outside of what we bring, there will not be much.

Qurrah laughed, untouched by the heat.
 He could not say the same for the elves, and as their pained screams reached his ears he only laughed louder.
 The half-orc ran as people flooded the streets, calling out for buckets and water.
 Too many homes were aflame.
 They could no longer cower within them and hope to be spared.
 In the commotion, Qurrah vanished, unseen and uncared for.
 He had spent his whole life disappearing in crowds, and in the dark of night, surrounded by fear and worry, he was just a shadow.

Usually when people said something nice and didn't mean it their smiles only lasted as long as they were speaking.
 I tried a tentative smile in return and his widened slightly.
 "I'm Brandon."
 Feeling more than a little nervous, I allowed him to capture my right hand in his.
 "I'm Adr...Adriana."
 Our handshake had ended, but my hand was tingling slightly.
 It was a pleasant, if illusionary, reminder of the contact, one I was hoping would last for about the next three days.
 "You must be the poor soul who's got everyone buzzing with curiosity."
 Brandon reached into the tall, glass-fronted fridge next to the cashier while he was talking, and pulled out a bottle of water and one of those aggressively-colored energy drinks.
 He slipped some money to the cashier while I was still trying to come up with a response that didn't sound stupid.

Your incredible eyes and hair, you are breathtaking.‚Äù Rodregas looked at her, his eyes going slowly over her entire body as he spoke.
 Then he shifted his gaze toward Imeralda‚Äôs large green eyes.
 As their eyes held he slid over to her, running the back of his hand across her cheek.
 ‚ÄúYou are so beautiful, your skin so soft,‚Äù Rodregas said.
 ‚ÄúYou are the complete woman; beautiful, intelligent, brave.‚Äù He reached down and placed his finger below her chin and raised it up to be equal in height to his.
 ‚ÄúI have wanted you since I first saw you,‚Äù and with that straight forward statement, he reached down, and holding her face steady with his single finger, he slowly, softly kissed her.
 For a moment she tried to pull away, but he kept the pressure of his finger steady and firm so she could feel his desire.
 He made his lips eager but light, not too forceful.
 He was strong and he let her feel his strength, but he also gave her plenty of leverage so that if she truly wanted to pull away she could.
 He was making his desire clear, but the decision was hers.

 Reaching lower meant he had to draw her closer.
 "Hmmm--there's a piece at the top too."

Well as a kid she used to scare my sister and me with horror stories about the Republican Party and conservatives in general, with the stories about rush Limbaugh being the worst of the lot.
 In fact it wasn‚Äôt until just a couple years ago that I could watch a speech by one of their number without wetting myself and shaking in fear.
 But onto other things well she always was a wonderful cook, with mushrooms and brownies being her specialties, we had those a lot, when there was enough to eat anyways.
 We were poor but happy, often mother would make us clothes out of flowers and stuff, they were colorful and pretty during the summer and they smelled real good.

They then dragged the body outside to where the deceased elf had kept a private garden.
 Thick brick walls guarded against any prying eyes.
 They dug a large hole in a corner and then bled the body dry, letting the fluids soak into the dirt.
 Occasionally, they would halt and listen, worried their violent struggle had reached unwanted ears.
 No curious investigators arrived, however, and they continued with their dark deed.
 When the blood dripping from the elf‚Äôs wounds became but a trickle, they filled the hole and moved on.
 Using the clothes and robes from upstairs, the two brothers wiped away as much of Ahrqur‚Äôs blood as they could.
 They tossed the bloody clothes, the table, and the pieces of glass they into the fireplace and burned them.
 Harruq wrapped the body in spare blankets he found in a closet.

‚ÄúNo sleep tonight,‚Äù he said, turning back to the building that had been his shelter.
 Fire swarmed around his fingers.
 Like streams of water, it flowed from his hands, splashing across the roof and setting it ablaze.
 Finished, he ran for an alley to hide as the fire gained the attention of the many patrols.
 He heard footsteps and shouts further down the road so he ducked left, running in between homes as all around the shouts grew louder.
 The houses ended, and like a fleeing thief he burst out into the streets only to slam into a drunken man holding a small bottle.
 The two rolled, a tangle of legs and arms.
 The small bottle shattered.

I pushed myself into sitting position and crawled over to Seth.
 He had his arms behind his head and was staring at the sky.
 He smiled at me when he saw me.
 ‚ÄúYou okay?
 You freaked out before,‚Äù he asked, his voice full of concern.
 I nodded and answered shakily, ‚ÄúYou know that I hate falling.
 You must have been scared too.‚Äù He hesitated.
 ‚ÄúYes, I was, but I think I was more concerned that you would wake the dead with your screams and they would attack us too.‚Äù I smacked him lightly on the arm and laid down next to him.
 I stared at the sky.
 ‚ÄúSo where are we?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, our winged friend managed to get us out of the woods and near the mountains.

The advantages of cooperation between republics needs to be care fully examined.
 A study should be conducted by a credible institution to estimate the economic losses incurred by the break-up of the common economic space between the former Soviet re publics and to assess the benefits of restoring an economic union in some form.
 It should estimate overall economic growth and living standards for each republic over the next five years operating within and outside the economic union.
 This study can serve as a powerful argument for closer cooperation among the republics.
 The study can be undertaken at very low cost by a consortium of researchers from different research institutes within the Commonwealth of Independent States.
 5.Privatize and develop road transport: Transportation is a major bottleneck to development of a market economy in much of the region.
 Under the centrally planned system, most freight was hauled by trains over main routes to large cities for distribution in bulk by huge government procurement agencies.
 Under a market system, millions of small producers and consumers must be free to buy or sell wherever the price is most attractive.
 This requires a vast proliferation of small goods transporters in the private sector, which are rare in many countries today.
 The large freight transport monopolies have to be replaced by entrepreneurial companies with small fleets competing for freight business.

See, at that time, everyone wanted to play and sing, but not everyone could write.
 So I wrote.
 And, even if we never performed any of it, which we didn‚Äôt, they were my songs, and they were popping up on the radio.
 Sebastian did, ‚ÄúLemmy Caution‚Äôs Incubus,‚Äù and I think that was really the start of it.
 That was big for him‚Äîhe has that voice, you know, like he‚Äôs sitting next to you, and it perfectly fit the song.
 God bless him‚Äîno slouch at writing songs himself, he really took me under his wing, sort of.
 Not much has been made of that connection, but John, early on, taught me the logistics of writing for money, of getting my stuff with one of the music publishers.
 A lot of artists did this, you know, kind of like what Dylan was doing with The Basement Tapes, except that took on a whole life of its own, because it was Bob.
 So, I did some demos, at Ardent with Jim‚Äôs help, and others, I just wrote, you know, just committed them to paper and John helped me get them disseminated.
 It worked well then to do that.

I jumped to my feet and almost ran for Alec, but she grabbed my hand with more of that fragile strength, and pulled me back down.
 "There isn't anything he can do for me, child, and unless I'm very much mistaken he's more than normally worried right now.
 He's in no kind of way needing yet more to fret about.
 Just let me catch my breath and I'll be as right as ever."
 Several minutes later, once the renewed bout of coughing had subsided, Mallory looked back up at me with wan features.
 "How did it happen?
 What brought things between Brandon and our Alec to a head?"
 "It was my fault.
 I'd been dating Brandon, and we went to a party.

In 1991 the industrial nations spent more than $180 billion on agricultural subsidies to support their farm populations, which is three times the total world overseas development assistance.
 These subsidies cost Western consumers another $135 billion annually in terms of higher food costs.
 Agricultural protectionism in the North not only places powerful constraints on exports from developing countries, but also directly interfere with the livelihood of one-third of the entire human race living in developing countries.
 The elimination of the system of quotas and subsidies to Western farmers can dramatically reduce the budget deficits of industrial nations and bring down food prices, while stimulating large-scale expansion of agriculture, industrialization and job growth in developing countries.
 Existing trade barriers by the industrial nations to textile exports cost developing countries an estimated $50 billion annually.
 The complete elimination of these barriers could result in a doubling of textile exports by developing countries.
 This labour-intensive industry can be another engine for job creation in developing countries and rising demand for technology and capital goods from the industrial nations.
 The progressive reduction, leading to the eventual elimination, of barriers to trade in agricultural products and textiles is an important step that can substantially improve the employment opportunities of people in developing countries.
 5.Improve access to markets: The most important structural change in the world economy over the past 35 years has been the five-fold increase in the world share of manu factured exports gained by the developing countries as a group, up from 4 per cent to 19 per cent, compared with a current market share of about 13 per cent each of the United States and for Japan.
 Although 54 per cent of these manufactures come from five top exporting countries, a large number of countries export more than $1 billion in this category annually.

She lived in 1927.
 She was going back.
 Then she'd be able to talk to her mother about any confusing feelings that might linger.
 She put on her Egyptian-motif dress, her ugly black shoes, and even her 1927 underwear.
 Rick, thankfully, was in his own shower when she went downstairs and out to the garden.
 She didn't really think she'd be able to get back on a clear, bright afternoon, but she needed to put herself closer, emotionally at least, to home.
 "Marie?"
 Rick called as he searched the house for her.
 She wasn't in the living room or kitchen.
 He went upstairs and looked in her bedroom.

"No.
 But it isn't enclosed.

 But she was fascinated, not scared.
 The cart made to resemble a bicycle took them through the air above a moonlit village, and she squeezed Rick's hand in delight rather than fear.
 She enjoyed it so much that they got back in line and rode again.
 But as much as she enjoyed the "E.T."
 ride, it couldn't compare to the "Back to the Future" ride.
 That was really like flying--even more than in the airplane.
 It was more like having wings of her own, soaring high and low, below bridges and over mountains.

One by one, the skulls‚Äô fire went out and they fell like morbid hail upon the city.

 "Do you have it in 1927?"
 "Yes--it's one of my favorites."

 ‚ÄúWill do Jazell.‚Äù He stood up and walked over to Emily.
 I sat on the ground next to Seth.
 His eyes were closed and he looked dead.
 His blue hair was ruffled up in all directions.
 I was so sure that he might be dead that I placed a hand on his chest, feeling for a heartbeat.
 I felt the steady thump under my fingers and I sighed in relief.

Chapter 8 I was midway through brushing my teeth before I realized I'd had another night filled with nothing but regular dreams.
 I'd walked into two different classes and found out that there were tests I'd forgotten about, been stranded at the side of the road, and been chased through some kind of rain forest, but while some of those dreams had been plenty terrifying, none of them had even a touch of the surreal vividness of the ones I'd had my first few nights in Sanctuary.
 Maybe they were just some kind of psychological defense mechanism popping up in response to all the changes.
 If so, I kind of wished I could be sick still.
 It's a heck of a thing to not want to be healthy, but I'd gone to bed most every night hoping I'd get to experience another one.
 It was depressing to think that I probably had one less thing to look forward to.
 Looking at the clock, I saw that I was a bit behind schedule.
 The bus would be here in about ten minutes, and Britney was supposed to arrive just a tad before that.
 It was sad, but I didn't trust her anymore, so I'd probably take the bus if she didn't show up before it did.
 I just couldn't risk her leaving me here without a ride.

The rest of the world was poorly represented.
 Only 51 nations ‚Äì including only two African states, two East Asian nations and three Soviet republics ‚Äì out of the current total of 184 UN members were present at its founding.
 This structure is based on political realities that no longer hold true.
 As the limitations of the League led to renewed conflagration two decades later, so the arrangements underlying the establishment of the UN contained within them the seeds of the confrontation between the superpowers and the Cold War.
 The present international system of governance is as far from being truly representative and ‚Äòdemocratic‚Äô as many erstwhile authoritarian governments that incorporated the popular adjective in the names of their parties or states.
 The UN Charter assigns primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security to the Security Council of 15 members, of whom five are permanent members with veto power over all matters.
 In no other constitution or organization founded on democratic principles is it accepted that a few members may thus invalidate the decisions of the majority.
 The General Assembly, in which all members are represented and which is headed by an elected Secretary, is only an advisory body, constituted to ‚Äòdiscuss any questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security‚Äô and to ‚Äòmake recommendations with regard to any such questions to the state or states concerned or to the Security Council or both‚Äô.
 This authorization is restricted by the provision that in regard to any dispute or situation in which the Security Council is exercising its functions under the Charter, the General Assembly will not make any recommendations with regard to the dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.
 It may have been the wisdom of the great powers to fashion this non-democratic structure and maintain it, so long as the superpowers and the military blocs stood in firm opposition to each other, and so long as military power was a primary factor in world affairs.

The man thrashed once and then laid still.
 The second body flew by in a blur.
 With such swiftness, Rodregas reasoned, he must have a sigil of speed.
 He headed right for Doi‚Äôvan and was behind Rodregas before he could do anything.
 Doi‚Äôvan must have seen him coming from his position and he dropped his bow and pulled his great sword.
 The guard must have been thinking ‚ÄúForest Nymph‚Äù due to the nature of the archery attack from the forest because he was unprepared for the strength of the blow.
 Like the one Rodregas had hit, the sword failed to cut armor.
 The guard, with the speed of his sigil, blocked it.
 But he blocked it sword to sword instead of using the momentum and speed to simply guide the sword away from his body.
 The resulting blow had an unpleasant sound and cut right through Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs sword.

I've noticed you've been working on the older material during class, which I very much approve of, but you may want to listen today.
 We're starting a new section, and it should be fairly straightforward for you to pick up."
 I shouldn't have been surprised when she turned out to be right.
 The new chapter was on probability, which had absolutely nothing to do with the stuff they'd been working on the week before.
 I quickly decided I didn't like the new stuff as much as what I'd been studying on my own, but it was relatively easy, and almost before I knew it class had ended and it was time to go to lunch.
 My doubts about whether or not everyone would be back in school today after three nights of partying were quickly resolved as Britney and I tried to fight through the ridiculous foot traffic on our way to our lockers.
 By the time we made it to the lunch room, I was heartily sick of dodging jocks with shoulders the size of an ox.
 Why on earth did every single one of them think it was necessary to mock fight, throw balls back and forth to each other, or otherwise make a spectacle of themselves?
 My mood was further soured as we arrived to find an unmistakable circle of bystanders signaling an impending fight.
 My first instinct was to go find a teacher before the two idiots hurt each other, but while I was still looking around to see if there was an adult in the room, Britney grabbed my arm and pulled me towards the circle.

 Ruby laid her hands on mine, which were trembling now, but I would not take the dust again.
 Tears streamed silently as I drifted, the ache in my chest only dulled by exhaustion.
 I felt weak when I woke, but I was silent about the pain as we continued the journey.
 Yearning to avoid my thoughts altogether, I spent much of the day in the mind of my horse.
 And the day passed.
 It was evening again when we stopped.
 I barely noticed the group‚Äôs mood; though quiet, they seemed anxious and kept the perimeter close.

As my watcher, Chevelle would have been involved in the binding by Council.
 Maybe Fannie should have been punished for whatever she had done, but how could they assume I would follow in her footsteps?
 So I‚Äôd killed a bird, stolen a few papers from the council library.
 My argument faltered, so I went back to anger, betrayal that he had lied to me.
 And not just him.
 The entire village must have known I was bound, known I couldn‚Äôt perform magic, as they sat and watched me try.
 Sending me to Junnie for lessons, allowing Evelyn to taunt me without recourse, giving me the blame for everything that happened.
 Because they expected me to turn.

Lots of years ago, I attended a Billy Graham crusade with these two friends.
 I listened, got moved, and turned to Christ.
 Cliff made a profession but, as far as I know, never followed up.
 Bob declined the invitation.
 What sent us to the crusade began with Eric Curtis.
 As I pass the beach camp at San Onofre where Eric and I spent a couple of my happiest weeks, I silence my I-pod and remember.

 I was fifteen when, on Christmas night, I lost my dad to a heart attack.
 He left my mom and me alone in our house on a hill a few miles north of Mexico and near enough to the Pacific so that when Santa Ana winds blew the gunk away, we could see ocean and islands.
 My mom was a rock.

Whoever was on the other side of the flimsy metal door I was hiding behind didn't just believe she would kill the other girl, she knew it, like someone who'd killed before.
 As scared as I was, I should have been a gibbering wreck, but strangely enough part of my mind was coldly rational.
 If I walked out right now I might be okay.
 If however they did kill the brunette, they'd come after me too.
 It was possible, it turned out, to be rational but still completely paralyzed by indecision.
 The girl was sobbing now, and my heart felt like it was about to tear itself into pieces.
 The creak of the bathroom door opening should have been a relief.
 I was expecting the tension to evaporate once there were more witnesses.
 I couldn't have been more wrong.
 The air had felt heavy before, now it felt alive, like ground zero of a lightning strike a split second before the soil was blackened by three hundred thousand volts.

Harruq bellowed like a bull caught in a cage.
 He jerked against his restraints but they held firm.
 Aurelia calmly walked over, raised her staff, and tapped him on the chest.

 Aurelia swung the staff with all her strength.
 The end cracked against Harruq‚Äôs cheek.
 Blood shot from his mouth.
 ‚ÄúFour!‚Äù she shouted.
 The fierce pain appeared to knock some sense into him.

‚ÄúGreetings, master,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúI have brought him as you asked.‚Äù
 Delighted, Velixar grinned as he surveyed the tall, muscular half-orc.
 As with Qurrah, he saw the untapped potential, incredible strength, and skill waiting for a purpose to harness it.
 The subtle shift of Velixar‚Äôs features slowed as he approached.
 When he spoke in his deep, rumbling voice, Harruq struggled against a sudden urge to join his brother on one knee.
 ‚ÄúSo you are Harruq?‚Äù the man in black asked.
 ‚ÄúI am,‚Äù Harruq said.

His face was contorted in agony, but that wasn‚Äôt what had done it.
 It was the fear.
 He had cracked.
 Chevelle released the tracker‚Äôs hand long enough for the man to scribble a few words of a spell, not allowing him to speak or cast magic.
 He slumped after his surrender, confident the worst was over.
 I reached the sword tip back to his leg and made another incision to release the snake.
 It jerked and coiled free of the wound, flicking blood over the tracker‚Äôs pristine white robe.
 Behind me, a low voice ordered, ‚ÄúKill him.‚Äù I glanced down at the sword, still in my hand.
 The sword I was supposed to take someone‚Äôs head off with.

It also could have been that I knew where they had fallen from the day before.
 Regardless, I made my way over and took a few volumes and scrolls back to my secluded table.
 I was able to find several documents on the northern clans and even one of the missing pages of names‚ÄîL.
 I had spread them out on the table and was studiously examining them when a shadow crossed my desk.
 I realized someone was standing there and distractedly glanced up to see who.
 My instinct to breathe deserted me.
 It was Chevelle Vattier.

For the first time in I don‚Äôt know how long, I was out of the castle.
 Free from practice, free from duties, free from walls.
 Though tricky to set up, the spell worked on Rune.
 I showed up at practice early and whispered the words in case something went wrong and he heard.
 I can‚Äôt imagine what my punishment would have been, though it might have been worth it.
 He fell asleep quickly and I ran as fast as I could, my pulse pounding with excitement.
 I spent the entire day away from the castle.

In the United Kingdom alone, an estimated 500,000 jobs will be lost for this reason in 1994.
 The impact of structural adjustments programmes has slowed economic growth and new job creation in a number of developing countries.
 Gains in productivity due to new technology, particularly delayed gains from the micro-computer revolution of the 1980s and the growth of factory automation, have slowed job growth in some industries.
 The increasing competitiveness of the NIEs of Asia and most recently China has displaced jobs in the West, primarily unskilled jobs.
 The major impact of several of these factors has already been felt and is now beginning to subside.
 Some will continue for several more years.
 Still others may entirely reverse their direction and contribute to job growth later in the decade.
 Not one is an irreversibly negative factor that will continue to exert a downward pressure on job growth for the foreseeable future.

 Home to the two half-orcs was in the older, mostly abandoned southern district of Veldaren.
 Those with wealth had drifted northeast, closer to the castle and away from the busy streets and markets.
 When King Vaelor had ordered all trade to come in through the western gate, and not the south, it had been the final nail in the district‚Äôs coffin.
 The homeless, hungry, and destitute flooded the rows of abandoned buildings, clawing them away from their legal owners with their very presence, or sometimes their murders.
 Harruq and Qurrah played that game well.
 They had grown up on the streets of Veldaren and fought for every scrap of food they‚Äôd eaten.
 They had punched and kicked for every soft, dry bed.

He could have shown her what her life would be like if she married him.
 But why couldn‚Äôt he just tell her what the article had said originally?
 She could draw her own conclusions about what the change in the article meant.
 Excited, he stood and headed for her room.
 But when he reached her door, he hesitated.
 Would she believe him about the article?
 She still felt loyal to that jerk, and she might not believe him.
 Especially since it was pretty obvious that he himself had something to gain by convincing her that she shouldn‚Äôt marry Davis.

 I succeeded with my goal of making him laugh.

 Apart from that, I spend an hour or two every day vetting Donovan's management of the family assets.

So he bought her one with the works, along with onion rings and a Sprite.
 She'd never had either of those two, and she sighed and rolled her eyes as if she were feasting on ambrosia.
 Since she'd had Coke but never heard of Sprite, he assumed that Sprite hadn't been invented by 1927, but he wondered if maybe the fact that she'd never had onion rings was due to her social class.
 Times had definitely changed where food was concerned.
 You had to be extremely wealthy and travel in very exclusive circles if you'd never had onion rings or-- "Pizza!"

 Moonlight glinted off Ruby‚Äôs figure in the distance, heading away from the village.

 And hopefully my phone wouldn‚Äôt stop me like it did most nights.

 They never seem to rest, much to my annoyance.
 I sighed and rolled over, burying my face in my pillow.

"Not an imposition.

 It felt wrong to try and kiss Alec right now.
 I didn't want to make light of Rachel's hurt, or Jasmin's loneliness, but his presence was too great a temptation to pass up.
 My face started out in the hollow of his neck, drinking in the ambrosia of his scent, and then moved up towards his lips without conscious decision on my part.
 Our lips met, and it felt like a warm, pleasant surge of electricity washed from my head down to the tips of my toes.
 My head started spinning almost instantly, only my hand on his chest, and his arms around my waist kept me from losing my balance completely.
 As it was, I still fell into him, overcome by weakness as my heart stopped beating altogether.
 No more than a second or two of breathlessness could have possibly passed, but Alec pulled away, firmly holding me at arm's length.

 The rock came at me again.
 I couldn‚Äôt respond quick enough, couldn‚Äôt counter and hold on to a galloping horse in the instant it took him to decide.
 It wasn‚Äôt dangerous, but it was like being slapped, and the irritation had me itching to burn something.
 The volley continued and whenever my anger showed, the rock came harder, faster, so I tried to control the emotion or at least hide it.

 ‚ÄúFor Kim, Because it Went by So Fast‚Äù---we worked our asses off to get that one right.
 I don‚Äôt know what was wrong really.
 It was a song I‚Äôd written right before we went into the studio, so we‚Äôd never done it live‚Äîmaybe that was the reason we struggled with it.
 But, the lyrics, you know, they‚Äôre a little complex: ‚ÄúI took my Melville out into the sun, what else could I do, I was in my twenties‚Äù it begins.

You are beautiful."
 I waited for the inevitable joke, or backhanded compliment to follow, but he seemed happy to just stop there.
 For once in my life I managed to be smart and do the same.
 "So what's the agenda for today?"
 Alec stretched and then shrugged.
 "School, just like every Monday."
 My groan brought a smile to his face.
 "I can ship pesky parents out of the country, but if you start a wholesale program of cutting class your mom will find out when she gets back."
 "So I just go about my day like normal, pretending like I don't know Brandon's a psychopath who just happens to be able to change shapes at will and rip big holes in brick walls?"
 I finally rolled out of bed, and started picking through the pile of bags from our shopping trip, hoping to find something that wouldn't make it look like I'd just won the lottery or robbed a bank.

 Harruq gave her no answer.
 Instead, he stabbed with Salvation, a higher thrust of Condemnation trailing behind it.

 Both swords stabbed high above her head.

 CHAPTER TWELVE
 Marie wanted to make Rick a special meal that evening.
 She felt terrible for having rejected his proposal.
 She looked through the two recipe books he'd bought her but couldn't find anything that appealed to her.
 Maybe she should just prepare something simple and have candlelight and flowers from the garden.
 No--that seemed silly.

I was frozen in fear, realizing that I hated falling.
 This was worse than my fear of rollercoasters.
 ‚ÄúCalm down,‚Äù Seth said to me.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to fall-‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, Seth?‚Äù I said in a panicked voice.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre freaking falling right now!‚Äù Emily looked at us and she tried to hide the fear in her face.
 ‚ÄúThe dragon is going to pull its wings around us to protect us from falling but it‚Äôs going to make us fall faster.
 Make sure you hold on to something or get in the center.‚Äù Seth pressed himself against me and we leaned closer to the dragon‚Äôs back.
 Jason tucked his arms under him and Emily pressed next to him.
 Then, as if on cue, the dragon tucked its great wings over us, blocking out the sky and we began to really fall.
 I screamed louder and sunk deeper into Seth, trying to forget that we were falling at about 90 miles per hour without a parachute.

Also he didn't have a single qualm when it came to using that knowledge to deflect questions aimed at me.
 Mrs. Sorenson tried three different times to make me look stupid before finally giving up and getting down to the business of teaching.
 She continued to shoot us nasty looks throughout the class, but I hardly noticed.
 Alec spent the rest of the class time writing questions for me in the margins of my notebook.
 By the time I'd described my grandparents, kindergarten teacher, and top three most embarrassing moments, I wanted to get a chance to ask some questions of my own, but he just shook his head and passed me my notebook back with a new set of quickly-jotted queries.
 The sentences should have been a careless mess based on the speed with which he was writing.
 Instead they turned out more even and carefully constructed than anything I'd ever been able to accomplish.
 I'm the Alpha here; you can ask your questions when I finish with mine.
 The flippant, humorous nature of his response was so atypical, and yet still quintessentially Alec.
 I nearly broke into a fit of laughter that would've gotten us both in even more trouble with Mrs. Sorenson.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get to shelter before dark.‚Äù As he headed into the hidden hollow the orchard became clear.
 He was sure that at one point it had straight rows and a pattern to it.
 But the orchard had been wild for a very long time.
 While there was a bunch of fruit trees and berry bushes, most were the descendants of the original orchard and it was hard to find anything that reassembled a straight row.
 The apples trees were in fruit and they all started grabbing a few of each to eat as they went.
 Rodregas was not much of a farmer and did not know what the different types were named, but he liked the small green ones with the yellow splotches; they were sweet with a wonderful tang.
 ‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan, ‚ÄúHiding on a ley line definitely makes sense for keeping the Immortalists off our back and these apples are delicious.‚Äù Rodregas stared at him as he ate.
 Humans ate around the core, but Doi‚Äôvan was eating the whole apple as he talked.

Much emphasis is placed on the widening gap in technology between North and South, but the gap in the technology of organization is even greater.
 Creation of new types of systems and organizations can create markets and jobs in many ways.
 The Dutch system of flower auction co-operatives is so successful that 68 per cent of the entire world‚Äôs exports of cut flowers pass through markets in the Netherlands.
 The franchise system has led to a rapid proliferation of new businesses and new jobs in the West in such widely diverse fields as food services, home remodelling, dry cleaning and real estate.
 Industrial estates, export processing zones, export promotion councils, export insurance, warehouse receipts, quality standards, and thousands of other organizational innovations have been either created or borrowed by developing countries to accelerate social progress.
 A comprehensive study of successful systems and institutions that can be transferred and adapted to local conditions will document the enormous untapped potential for stimulating faster economic and job growth by inventing, imitating and further improving social systems.
 Action Plan to Stimulate Employment in Developing Countries
 Employment generation is a product of multiple factors that combine together.
 Stimulating job creation requires a comprehensive approach, rather than partial policies or piecemeal strategies.
 The achievements of the Newly Industrializing Economies (NIEs) of East Asia demonstrate that tremendous increases in employment generation can be achieved based on comprehensive strategies.

Anvil was winded, though the strike wasn‚Äôt as severe as his previous show.
 Steed would unquestionably be the winner now and as he took aim to retaliate, his opponent raised his hands in surrender.
 ‚ÄúQuick thinking, Mister Summit.‚Äù The large man grinned and I was in no doubt they were old friends.
 Chevelle stepped forward then, eager.
 I had a feeling he‚Äôd been itching for this the way I‚Äôd been itching to burn Ruby.
 Steed smiled in acceptance, but not the same smile he‚Äôd given his last opponent.
 They stood across from each other and readied themselves.
 Both tensed but neither took the low, wide stance previously used.

The opening up of economic relations between the USA and China by President Nixon has made war between the two countries almost unthinkable.
 There are no serious conflicts in the world today that cannot be resolved through consultation, consensus and ‚Äòwin-win‚Äô formulas.
 Full Employment
 The fading spectre of nuclear annihilation gave way in the 1990s to the rising spectre of chronic unemployment.
 The end of the Cold War brought with it some wrenching transitions, among them the break-up of the USSR and Comecom, the reunification of Germany, the downsizing of defence manufacturers in America as the result of reduced orders for war materiel, the collapse of Japanese financial markets and onset of a decade-long recession, and displacement of millions of migrant Asian workers following the invasion of Kuwait and the first war in Iraq.
 These events violently disrupted expansion of the world economy and creation of employment opportunities for an expanding labour force in both industrialized and developing countries.
 Near panic levels of concern rippled across the world during this period about rising levels of joblessness, prompting one doomsday author to prophesize the ‚Äòend of work‚Äô.
 The situation became particularly acute in developing countries, because of their predominately young populations and high population growth rates.
 Trends and Prospects
 ICPF refused to side with the pessimists who viewed unemployment as a terminal illness spreading rapidly through the entire world economic system.

 Before we went to bed though there was a lot of furious writing as Emily tried to write everything down.
 After that, was all sleep.

Was Rodregas really that strong?
 Or was the bed just lighter than it looked?
 He went back over to the trunk and lifted it up; it to went up too easily and felt strangely light.
 Next he went over the dresser.
 Rodregas had known that the physical essence of the celestial lion was in his body and that all of his physical attributes would be improved, but the strength of the Immortalist was not common knowledge; you just heard that they were long lived and never got sick.
 They used magic against their foes not swords, and they seldom got involved in physical struggles.
 Of course Rodregas had known that in The Immortal Guard of the Guild the most loyal and powerful of their officers were given enhanced bodies, but he thought their power lay in their magical sigils.
 His new body was very large and very muscular, and much stronger than he would have guessed.
 Rodregas lifted his right arm and curled it into a tight muscle.
 He felt the biceps with his free hand.

The world that is emerging is one of unprecedented opportunity to tackle the problem of unemployment that emerged with the Industrial Revolution, the massive movement of people from the land into the cities, massive migrations from one country and continent to another in search of economic opportunities, and the lightning speed of technological development that has eradicated traditional occupations while spawning whole new types and fields of human activity.
 Thus, we are faced with the paradox: an employment problem of unprecedented dimension coupled with an opportunity of unprecedented magnitude; a problem that is not going to be eliminated any time soon by the force of market mechanisms alone, but one which can be dramatically diminished by the appropriate action of governments around the world.
 Opportunities, strategies, instruments and mechanisms are not lacking, provided there is a commitment and determination of commensurate strength, a commitment that is best formulated and enshrined by a recognition of employment as a fundamental human right supported by constitutional guarantees, a commitment that must be translated into a determination by all countries to implement a broad spectrum of available strategies to address the issue today.
 Among these strategies, the greatest necessity is for every country to continuously upgrade the quality, quantity and, most importantly, relevance of educational and vocational training programs to equip its citizens with the knowledge and skills needed for productive engagement in a rapidly evolving world.
 Food Security
 The world produces more than sufficient food to amply provide for all of humanity.
 Still, more than 800 million people spread throughout the developing world lack sufficient and secure access to nutritious food and clean drinking water.
 Between 1990 and 2000, malnutrition declined from 21 per cent to 18 per cent of the population of developing countries, but it actually increased marginally among the least developed nations, particularly in Africa.
 Incidence of malnutrition among children under five years of age remains severe in both Africa and South Asia.
 But the problem is more complex than these numbers suggest.

In spite of all the automation and all the export of jobs to lower wage economies, the percentage of the American population employed has continued to rise over time.
 Several factors are responsible for this result, among which population growth and technological development are most prominent.
 Rising levels of technological sophistication certainly displace workers in most fields of manufacturing.
 But at the same time they stimulate growth of employment in many different ways ‚Äì increasing demand for the products thus manufactured by a factor of 10, 100 or even 1000 fold as in the case of automobiles, TVs, cell phones and computers; increasing the demand for research workers to support technological innovation and for teachers to meet the rising demand for education; and rising living standards, which increases consumption of other goods and services due to the falling prices made possible by rising productivity.
 Over the past two decades the US economy lost nearly 4 million manufacturing jobs but added a net 37 million jobs through expansion of the service sector, which now accounts for 84 per cent of total employment.
 It is time that we stop resisting or resenting this trend, but rather strive to adapt by shifting our focus toward those fields of employment which are most directly stimulated by technological innovation.
 Export of commercial services already accounts for 20 per cent of world trade.
 The shift from manufacturing to services is a positive and inevitable expression of the elevation of human activity from the physical to the mental level, which is the central reason for the phenomenal rise in global living standards over the past century.
 Rich nations have become rich through a shift of workers from the primary farm sector to value-added, non-farm secondary and tertiary sectors.
 Poverty and hunger persist so long as a majority of the population depend upon the routine operations of farming for their livelihood.

‚ÄúUnleash our arrows,‚Äù Dieredon shouted back.
 ‚ÄúWatch for the necromancer.

 The blasphemous blanket of darkness stretched out below them like a great fog, filled with bobbing heads of Velixar‚Äôs army.
 In that chaotic mass, Dieredon knew the man in black would remain well hidden.
 Not until enough of the undead had been massacred.
 He readied his bow, his strong legs the only thing holding him to Sonowin.
 Three arrows pressed against the string of the bow, their tips dipped in holy water.
 His quiver, as was the quiver of every elf flying alongside him, contained water given to them by their clerics of Celestia.
 When their arrows bit into dead flesh, it would be like fire on a dry leaf.

It guaranteed that the squires stayed focused during meditation.
 Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda looked at him as he knelt in the grass with the sword naked on his bare arms.
 Rodregas spoke carefully so as not to tip the sword and said, ‚ÄúIt is called sword meditation.
 My instructor would start us out with the prayer and then we would meditative on our duty.‚Äù ‚ÄúFor how long?‚Äù asked Imeralda.
 ‚ÄúUntil you are sure of what your duty is,‚Äù Rodregas replied, hearing the voice of his old drill Knight Captain.
 All the instructors had been retired knights who enjoyed teaching the squires.
 He did not think the two would join him for this but both pulled their weapons and imitated his position, Doi‚Äôvan with his large great sword balanced on his powerful arms, Imeralda grabbed her bow instead of a short sword, which with her lack of training was probably a good idea.
 Rodregas focused inwards and resumed his meditation.
 He was finding it wonderful to do the meditation again; Rodregas had a lot of good memories from his life as a squire, before everything had gone wrong.
 Part of him felt uncomfortable for doing this again, like he no longer had the right.

Minutes later Jason and Seth emerged from the trees.
 They weren‚Äôt smiling or doing anything suspicious so I figured we were safe, for now.
 They sat down across from us.
 I noticed that Seth was avoiding my eyes.
 ‚ÄúSo whose crazy idea was it to meet under a truce when we‚Äôre having so much fun wreaking havoc on each other?‚Äù Jason asked.
 Emily sighed and pointed at me, ‚ÄúThis crazy person right here.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo what do you want?‚Äù he continued and eyed me.
 I took a small, quiet breath and said what I had planned, ‚ÄúI want to work on the dwarf problem.‚Äù I nodded towards Emily, signaling her to take out her paper.
 She groaned and pulled the folded piece of paper out of her pocket.
 She unfolded it and placed it in front of us.
 While we studied it, I tried to catch Seth‚Äôs eye, but he didn‚Äôt look at me.

The central element of the programme was the introduction of a new currency, the `superdinar', in parallel to the existing currency, but without demonetizing or confiscating it.
 Inspired by an experiment in the Soviet Union during the 1920s, the value of the new currency was tied to that of the Deutsche Mark and made fully convertible without restriction.
 Based on the country's very limited foreign currency reserves, new issues of the currency were to be utilized primarily to inject real purchasing power into the economy, revive demand and stimulate production, while covering the government's budget deficit during an initial six-month period needed for sufficient recovery.
 In this way the foreign currency and gold reserves were used as a buffer to moderate contraction of the money supply and avoid the shock usually accompanying such efforts.
 Issuing of the old dinar was stopped, but it remained in circulation as legal tender.
 An interest rate of six per cent was established for the superdinar - the first real, positive interest rate in years - to make holding the new currency an attractive alternative to hoarding goods or foreign exchange.
 It had been widely anticipated by foreign experts that this strategy would result in an immediate run on the country's foreign reserves and thereby a collapse of the new currency's foundation.
 Contrary to expectations, the initial months of the programme have yielded spectacular results.
 Inflation fell to zero per cent in the first week after the issue of the new currency and remained below one per cent during the first five months.
 Instead of a massive outflow of foreign currency through conversion of superdinars, people have rushed to cash in their foreign currency, resulting in a 60 per cent increase in the nation's reserves during the first three months.

Raising the skills of society to those of countries higher up on the scale will enable the country to move to that higher level.
 Despite enormous expansion of educational and training institutions, most developing countries suffer from a shortage of quality vocational skills among the huge number of people at lower levels of the society who seek desperately to raise their standard of living.
 This shortage retards the growth in productivity and quality needed to meet domestic needs and achieve international competitiveness.
 The technical training in frastructure in these countries should be expanded by the establishment of craft and vocational training institutes at the local level in every community to impart a wide range of basic technical skills.
 A massive programme of basic vocational and skills training should be launched on a parallel with the 100 per cent literacy programmes that are now being promoted by many governments to wipe out rural illiteracy.
 The military in many developing countries possesses the organizational capabilities and experience with intensive training to assist with this task.
 An institutional gap exists in agricultural training systems.
 In most developing countries, agricultural colleges, universities and polytechnics train researchers, government, bank employees and extension officers, but not farmers.
 Producing more food with less water, less chemicals and less soil erosion requires high levels of skill.
 The chain of agricultural training needs to be filled out at the lower level by establishing thousands of village-level farm schools as proposed in the chapter on food security.

 Rick hesitated at the kitchen door, glancing at Marie.

 She'd already made her decision.
 He led her into the garden.

I then called my wife who was so wound up from the lack of communication over such a long period of time.
 She sobbed uncontrollably as I told her I was unharmed, headed home, the ordeal was over and we busted the drug dealers.
 A hero‚Äôs welcome awaited me, as my son was so thankful for what I had done for him.
 As I went to bed that night, my mind would not shut off and the events of that evening replayed in my head over and over again.
 I lay awake for hours wondering what would have happened if the dealer hadn‚Äôt run into the cops.
 They both confessed to the drug deal when separately interrogated.
 The officer said they had less than half of the money, which she had attempted to hide in a trash can in the Starbucks‚Äô bathroom, and Steve had a gun, which Ashley admitted they would have used if I didn‚Äôt give them the drugs once I discovered they were short on cash.

It was time to end Korin‚Äôs vile pestilence on the world.
 Rodregas got behind him with his right hand covering his mouth, and with his left took a firm grip on the top of his head.
 Rodregas leaned over to his ear and whispered ‚ÄúYou probably don‚Äôt remember, but you killed a boy named Jorin by snapping his neck, and payback is a bitch.‚Äù Snapping a grown man‚Äôs neck is quite hard.
 Rodregas had never done it; he had learned that there were better ways to kill a man than trying to break his spine with bare hands.
 But with the memory of Korin breaking Jorin‚Äôs neck, adrenaline pounded in his new arms.
 This was justice long overdue.
 With a quick movement of his arms and the haunting memory of the sounds of crunching and popping from all those years ago, he twisted Korin‚Äôs head nearly all the way around.
 Rodregas held his body as it spasmed wildly for a moment.
 Then the Adapt went still and limp; and Rodregas dropped him to the floor.

For a second I thought the earth was shaking, but it was Alec, trembling much like he'd done Friday night.
 A loud crack from beside us made me jump.
 Alec looked at the branch, easily as thick as my arm, which he'd just torn from the tree we were leaning against.
 He stopped shaking as he considered what he'd done to the poor tree.
 "You're saying that because you're worried for me?
 Not because you really want to go back to him?"
 I shook my head, as confused by his reaction, by how close he'd come to losing control, as I was by my not having felt threatened.
 "No, I want to stay, but how can I knowing it will mean you're going to be fighting to the death?"

First use of such weapons by any power should automatically invoke the strongest collective security measures under the UN Security Council.
 The decision on whether to permit the continued existence of nuclear weapons is of too great importance to the future of humanity to be left to the discretion of one or a few member nations of the international community.
 Under the present structure of the UN, the only body with authority to act is the Security Council, but the veto power of the five permanent members deprives other nations of an effective voice.
 The proposal to ban completely the possession and use of nuclear weapons should be put before the Council.
 The right of veto should be rescinded with respect to this most crucial issue.
 A time-bound plan should be drawn up by the UN for complete and total nuclear disarmament by all nations.
 Ban on ballistic missiles
 Nuclear devices are the most lethal class of weapons, but much of their threat arises from the development of ballistic missile technology which can deliver them to distant targets unmanned and without risk to the aggressor.
 Even if nuclear weapons are eliminated, these vehicles can be utilized to carry large conventional payloads that strike terror in a distant population.
 The danger to all nations of unexpected and unprovoked attack from near or distant powers can be vastly reduced by declaring an immediate ban on the use of ballistic missiles of all types, including those carrying conventional warheads.

 It was not that she had floated down.
 It was as if she had she had been in a regular sized tree.
 She smiled and waved at him to follow her.

 If it did not work, between his Celestial essence and now the Night Panther‚Äôs sigil, he probably would not die.

By focusing on critical threats that can only be met through common action, it has changed the way people and nations think about the world and each other.
 A consciousness of One World is emerging above the din of individualistic and nationalistic self-interest.
 This new perspective will enable us to generate effective strategies for addressing many problems that have thus far defied solution.
 In addition to these nine factors, two powerful revolutions are re-drawing the landscape of the global society and generating an unparalleled dynamism for rapid progress on the issues of critical concern to humanity.
 Democracy, Peace and Development
 The first is a revolutionary movement from authoritarianism to democracy that has travelled around the world during the past decade.
 The initial wave swept through Latin America in the early 1980s, replacing military regimes in Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay and Bolivia.
 In 1979, 12 out of 19 Latin American countries had authoritarian governments.
 By 1993, every country except Cuba and Haiti had a democratically elected government.
 Glasnost and perestroika in the USSR initiated a second and more powerful tide of freedom that expanded rapidly through Eastern Europe and then to other continents, in the same way that India‚Äôs attainment of freedom from colonial rule gave birth to a host of freedom movements and new nations after the Second World War.

 Deeper in the forest, Aurelia stepped out of a glowing blue portal.
 An elf waited there, an ornate bow slung across his back.
 ‚ÄúSo do you think it could be him?‚Äù he asked her.
 ‚ÄúPerhaps,‚Äù Aurelia said.
 ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs in him.
 Something is wrong, though.
 He‚Äôs too light hearted, too free.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù the other elf asked, his fingers twitching at the string of his bow.
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Dieredon.‚Äù Aurelia sighed.

 CHAPTER ONE
 "Haven't you had enough, Marie?"
 "No," she replied, too busy looking around to spare her companion a glance.
 "Your father will kill you if you get home past midnight.
 And me if he finds out where I've taken you."
 "Don't worry, Tom--it's barely 11:00.
 We'll leave in half an hour."
 Marie was entranced by the music and lights and laughter of the speakeasy.
 For months she'd been nagging her cousin Tom to bring her here.

 Harruq gasped at the thought.
 He had always felt akin to man and orcs, whose lives burnt out so quickly.
 The idea of living two hundred years was‚Ä¶‚Äåwell, more than he could handle.
 ‚ÄúStrange,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúGuess I have plenty of time to learn to read, don‚Äôt I?‚Äù
 Aurelia laughed.
 ‚ÄúYou do, but I would prefer we not take too many years.
 Spending that much time around you is bound to give me bad habits.‚Äù

Steed, I was almost sure because of his stance.
 I scanned the darkness and found two other figures.
 One was about the size of Steed; the other was thinner and appeared fidgety, even in the darkness.
 They approached Ruby and Steed and out of the shadows I could see their dark hair.
 The thinner one‚Äôs hair was long, his bangs falling over sharp features.
 I studied their gestures in the moonlight, occasionally catching a few words.
 It seemed they were planning, but I couldn‚Äôt be sure.
 There was movement again in the shadows as more figures approached.
 I inched forward, anticipating when they would come into view.
 One of the forms was a mass, low to the ground.

 ‚ÄúIn time, the burden of sustaining life in them will seem weightless.

My wife was a champ as ‚Äúthat thing‚Äù (her nick-name for it) sat in a million pieces in the garage for so long.
 Seeing Brandon heading down the wrong path, I knew only what not to do.
 I had no idea what to do.
 I remember a lesson I learned while coaching youth sports.
 ‚ÄúThe hardest kid to coach is your own.‚Äù A true statement.
 I found myself unable to dissuade my eldest son from the dangerous road he would travel.
 Chapter 14: What Have I Done Wrong?
 When Brandon was about eighteen, I busted him for being stoned.
 I knew the way pot smelled, so it wasn‚Äôt any great detective work that led me to it.
 Soon after this, we discovered he had obtained a license to obtain medical marijuana.

The third church she was asked to leave.
 Though she didn‚Äôt explain, I suppose her expulsion resulted from her theory about evil being inside us all or from the fear she would infect the congregation with notions that could lead to an epidemic of broken marriages.
 At the end of her story, Curly comes over and gives her friend some reasons they need to move along.
 Before they leave, Curly reaches down and rubs my shoulder.

It was too much.
 It took me to that familiar, mindless place, and I turned to walk toward home, void of any sensation save the slow rain on my skin.
 When I entered the house, Fannie was there, but I only trudged past her on the way to my room.
 I barely took notice of her expression, her tight grin and suspicious eyes as she took in my mud-streaked clothes, dripping hair.
 I didn‚Äôt speak; I was spent and I just couldn‚Äôt make myself care.
 In the dark of my room, I collapsed onto the bed, dropping asleep to the thrum of falling rain.
 I woke gasping from another dream of my mother and destruction.
 The rain had stopped, and the sun was rising, so I wiped the sweat from my brow and went to the hall pitcher to splash my face.
 The dark roots of my hair were stark in the mirror‚Äôs reflection, and I recalled the dream.
 The memories of my mother were fuzzy, but I‚Äôd always thought she‚Äôd had light hair, beautiful and golden like Junnie‚Äôs.

It was the trendy girl from the office, and she apparently still didn't like me.
 I felt my face get even hotter, only now I was both angry and embarrassed.
 It was a relief to sink down into a chair with my back to Brandon and his friends.
 Strangely enough, Britney also being so obviously uncomfortable helped calm me down.
 "Okay, out with it, why is this such a big deal?"
 Britney shifted back and forth in her seat for a couple of seconds before leaning in to whisper.
 "It really shouldn't be a big deal, but everyone around here acts like it's taboo.
 Two hikers were killed by some kind of wild animal a few months ago."
 I felt my heart skip a beat as a chill ran from the base of my spine all the way to my scalp.
 Britney's innocuous words shouldn't have caused my mind to immediately sink back to the terror I'd felt this morning, but they did.

As the evolution of the international community proceeds towards the establishment of an effective system of world governance in one form or another, the collective rights of the international community of nations must inevitably come to be regarded as another inalienable truth, alongside individual human rights and the rights of each nation.
 The right of the nation state to self-determination has to accommodate the rights of other nations and the common shared rights of every human being.
 This approach establishes criteria for determining when claims of national sovereignty must be ignored.
 Every right is accompanied by a responsibility.
 A government that fosters external aggression or cannot contain domestic violence and civil strife, that cannot create conditions in which its people can feed themselves or even receive outside assistance, fails the test of sovereignty.
 Under these circumstances, the international community, through the UN, should have the right and accept the responsi bility to intervene appropriately.
 The need of the hour is not to undermine the legitimate right of nations to self-determination, but rather to protect that right by more clearly demarcating its legitimate boundaries against the highly visible challenges being posed by forces of disintegration and fragmentation from within.
 The current tendency for states to fragment along ethnic lines cannot be handled by any abstract principle of international law.
 It depends on the understanding and will of people.
 The evolution of larger, heterogeneous national units functioning under principles of equality is an outstanding product of civilization that should not and cannot be reversed without great damage to the general welfare of humanity.

Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs eyes were literally glowing red and he was tossing his horned head with his wild black hair flying.
 Imeralda had not seen him in such a mood before, not even during the battle with the slave caravan.
 Imeralda thought that Rodregas was only marginally better.
 The muscles of his neck and shoulders were bunched up and she could feel his anger through her bond with him.
 But he was also breathing deeply and through the bond she knew he was trying to control himself.
 Imeralda saw that Rodregas was also watching Doi‚Äôvan.
 She thought he also recognized the danger of a Hellborn rage.
 Imeralda reached out to Rodregas first to try to get him to calm down and help manage Doi‚Äôvan.
 Imeralda focused on their bond and looked him in the eyes and said, ‚ÄúRodregas getting angry will not change things, let‚Äôs sit down and talk to the village elders.

Apparently I'd only thought the anger was under control.
 It frothed beneath the surface right now, anxious for a reason to bite someone's head off, and Britney was the preferred target.
 Only I needed her.
 Not enough to completely dismiss what had happened though.
 "I don't know what you're talking about, but I honestly wouldn't have told you anything I wanted kept a secret.
 Not after the way you told everyone about my panic attacks."
 Britney looked like she was having a hard time getting enough air.
 She gasped a couple more times, and then managed to get some words out.
 "I'm so sorry.

If you want to leave we'll give her a ride home."
 I could see the wheels turning in her head.
 If I really did have a ride, she could leave without ruining things with Brandon; but if I wasn't going to lie, then there was a good chance that Mrs. Campbell would find out she'd left early.
 Parents were relatively easy to fool.
 Leave the tutor lab early, go somewhere else and kill some time until you were supposed to come home, and they'd never know the difference.
 Teachers were a little harder, but if you didn't have the help of your 'friends', then they became an insurmountable obstacle.
 The gears finally ground to a stop and Britney sighed as she put her head down on the table.
 I tried to stop from smiling at her theatrics, but happened to look over at Rachel just in time to see a matching smile on the younger girl's face.
 Before I could look away, Rachel held up the red side of her card.

I hurried to finish lacing the boots, throwing the cloak around my shoulders as he left more rations and went to ready the horses.
 I stretched out on the ground to eat, examining the carved medallion clasped to my boot.
 Chevelle stepped away again, disappearing behind the rocks that had become more jagged and taller along our way.
 When he returned, the sight of him stole my breath.
 His worn traveling clothes were gone, exchanged for dark gray and black, a leather vest covering his shirt, the laces loose at his chest.
 A long, dark cloak was clasped at his shoulders, the material thick and coarse, so unlike the soft robes the rest of council wore.
 I knew I was gaping at him, but there was something so strange about it.
 He caught my eye and I let my gaze fall to his sword belt, struggling to gather my composure.
 I had to remind myself that he despised me.

I jolted awake, the smell of burning flesh still lingering in my senses, and was staring at Ruby‚Äôs ceiling.

 I was alone in her bed, but could hear an exchange of low whispers from the open door as she and Steed conversed in the front room.
 I wasn‚Äôt about to announce I had woken.
 My head didn‚Äôt throb as before, no sour mouth.
 It was overall a much better experience.
 But who could stand the dreams?
 I rolled to my side, rubbing the sleep from my face.
 There were a few books on the bedside table and I reached over to draw the top one near.
 I flipped idly through the pages, until I recognized it was detailing the different aspects of magic.

Whenever school was out, I used to ride with him on overnight runs to El Centro, in the desert, which in the summer turned so hot, I imagined all the inhabitants were escaped criminals who figured the police wouldn‚Äôt chase them into that hellish air.
 Going over the mountains in the truck cab with my dad sitting tall behind the wheel and jamming the mysterious floor shift back and forth, I gazed down at the other drivers and passengers and felt safe and full of everything that mattered.
 Many dozens of times, I rode with my dad on the narrow and winding two-lane highway past the very boulder that crushed Eric‚Äôs head.
 My first successful story was called ‚ÄúCars‚Äù.
 It tells of two young fellows who lost their fathers.
 Henry Swift and his best friend Bingo, who lands in a nursing home after a car wreck.
 He can‚Äôt speak or do much of anything except wheel his chair in widening circles.
 Whenever Henry encounters a crisis or challenge, he goes to Bingo and bares his soul but never gets an answer.
 Maybe on account of being an only child, ever since I can remember, I have longed for a best friend to whom I could tell all the crazy stuff I think and feel.
 A best friend is what I hoped Karen Flagstad could be.

I'd spent weeks numb to the entire world.
 I'd even missed Dad's favorite season, the one that'd become mine as well.
 It'd be all too easy to slip into the same kind of numbness now as a refuge against everything.
 What would happen if I failed to surface?
 It'd been easier to lapse into catatonia this time than last.
 Would I reach a point where I couldn't come back?
 There'd been a time right after the accident where Mom had thought I was already there.
 I was just numb enough still to think about such things without immediately collapsing.
 Even so, I felt a pang of dizziness as my mind warned me I'd pushed it too far today.
 I found myself in the kitchen, nearly finished making enchiladas with only vague ideas of why I'd started pulling ingredients out of the fridge.

She wrapped her arms around him, trying to get closer to him.
 When he raised his head, she whimpered, wanting his mouth on hers again.
 But she gasped with pleasure as he began nibbling on her earlobe.
 Rick wanted to do much more than kiss her, and she was making it difficult to resist.
 He'd never held a woman so eager, so responsive to his slightest touch.
 But he had to stop.
 He had to stop now.
 He raised his head, straightening and pulling away.

Donovan had been waiting in the hall just outside Alec's room.
 He'd pressed objects into Dom and Jasmin's hands, and then brushed his lips across the back of my hand.
 He slipped away, and then we'd entered a brightly-lit room filled with the rest of the pack.
 Alec had picked me up and carried me out to a massive SUV that I'd never seen before.
 Everyone piled in, and despite the seriousness of rapidly approaching events, I fell back asleep somewhere en route to our destination.
 Apparently you couldn't drive all the way though, because we were walking again, or at least some of us were.
 I could just make out Isaac off a little ways into the darkness.
 He was in hybrid form and moving with a ground-devouring gait that was deceptively smooth.
 Flashes of movement off to either side of us, lower to the ground, made me sure the girls were all following along on four legs.
 Alec shifted me around as he realized I was awake.

All that mattered was the story and the warm drowsiness that increased with each breath.
 "Adjam saw his brother's frustration grow, but he never suspected just how strong it'd become until two hunters brought Inock to bay, and he turned on them.
 Inock killed the first hunter and would have done likewise to the second, but Adjam sprang upon his brother, knocking him away before the second man could be harmed."
 Alec's fingers slowly caressed my stomach as he spoke.
 It should have tickled, but instead it lulled me even further towards oblivion.
 "And thereby the full effect of the Earth's curse was felt.
 Trapped as they were in their beast forms, neither brother could talk to the other, and the resulting confrontation quickly spun out of control.
 Hours later Adjam was left bleeding and broken as his brother disappeared into the night."
 Alec's soothing voice continued on, but I'd lost the ability to listen.
 My mind floated off into visions of a battered wolf who dragged himself over to a brook before collapsing on the bank, streaked with mud.

The land here started to roll, the trees a deeper green, their trunks too narrow.
 It didn‚Äôt seem as if I‚Äôd gone that far, only half a day following Chevelle and then this time on my own.
 The changes here made me anxious to see the North.
 I glanced at my palm once more.
 I thought I‚Äôd figured out most of the lines‚Äîcreeks curving through the landscape, mountains a jagged ridge across the top‚Äîbut there were still a lot of unanswered questions.
 My hand squeezed into a nervous fist, but I kept moving.
 I tried not to think about all that had happened‚Äînot Fannie or the trial, not Junnie and especially not Chevelle.
 I just kept putting one foot in front of the other.
 I couldn‚Äôt even imagine what lay in the mountains where I was heading, but there was no going back.
 I wasn‚Äôt tired anymore, not as I had been every day since I‚Äôd been using magic.

Rodregas hit knee high and the man trying to run by went flying head first into the dirt.
 Rodregas knew from the feel of the blow that his sword had hit armor and bounced off.
 It was an Immortal Guard.
 Doi‚Äôvan shot another arrow almost straight down into the back of the neck of the downed guard.
 The man thrashed once and then laid still.
 The second body flew by in a blur.
 With such swiftness, Rodregas reasoned, he must have a sigil of speed.
 He headed right for Doi‚Äôvan and was behind Rodregas before he could do anything.
 Doi‚Äôvan must have seen him coming from his position and he dropped his bow and pulled his great sword.
 The guard must have been thinking ‚ÄúForest Nymph‚Äù due to the nature of the archery attack from the forest because he was unprepared for the strength of the blow.

I was thoroughly enjoying it‚Äîreveling in it, if I was honest with myself.
 He persisted in trying to touch and kiss me anytime I was close enough to allow, and I let him sometimes.
 He surprised me one evening, when he knew it was time for me to leave, grabbing my wrist and holding me there.
 I was stronger than him, but I didn‚Äôt resist his pull as he spoke.
 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go.‚Äù I smiled.
 ‚ÄúI will return tomorrow.
 Early.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said, flush with emotion.
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt ever want you to go.‚Äù I laughed and he drew me closer.
 ‚ÄúStay with me.‚Äù I started to pull away and he reached up, placing his hands on either side of my face, feverish now.
 ‚ÄúMarry me, Lizzy.‚Äù I had long since gotten used to the name, but I wasn‚Äôt sure he was talking to me at first.

 Like Brother Lawrence, Olga didn‚Äôt urge anybody to retire to a monastery, only to try to stay in as close contact to God as they could in their own place and position.
 Besides Eric and Olga, Mother Teresa has taught me plenty.
 Judith Moore, a wise and benevolent editor at the San Diego Reader, sent me to Tijuana to report on the Missionaries of Charity seminary there.

Inside was a stash of healing potions.
 All he needed was one and he could fight again.
 Just one.
 As he reached to open a drawer he felt his leg jerk back, halting his momentum.
 He crashed to the floor, screaming in pain as one of his forearms landed hard.
 Then he felt his ankle start to burn.

 Harruq did not bother to cross the distance.

 Harruq stood and looked down.
 His arms and legs bulged with muscle.
 He flexed his arm and stared at the growth that traveled all the way up to his neck.
 He felt within himself a lifewell of energy, one infinitely deep.
 ‚ÄúDiscard your swords, Harruq,‚Äù Velixar said.
 ‚ÄúYou are the protector of my disciple.
 You deserve better.‚Äù
 He slid his two swords out from their sheaths, stunned by the ease in which he moved them.
 It was if they went from being made of steel to air.

I would call the target soon and instruct her to meet me in a particular spot.
 Things moved rapidly now and the instructions came quickly.
 I was instructed to get as much incriminating conversation as I could, including the price, quantity and name of the drug; anything beyond that would be helpful but gravy.
 The main thing was to get the money for the drugs.
 Then I was shown the contents of a small white plastic bottle: One hundred Oxys poured into the officer‚Äôs hand.
 They were smaller than I thought they would be and an odd green color.
 He gathered the pills back into the bottle and handed them to me, telling me to put them in an easily accessible jacket pocket.
 The officers were all gathered around, but my focus was now entirely on the lead man, Officer White, the same undercover officer who had busted my son, had screwed up by giving Brandon the wrong phone number and with whom I had negotiated this deal.
 He was cocky and his ego always front and center, but I completely understood this demeanor.
 A person who does this for a living should have a high level of confidence, and that translates into what one might call ‚Äúa strong personality.‚Äù I was listening as if my life depended on these men.

Movement behind his army caught his eye.
 He shoved a few men aside, tore through the center of his army, and then emerged at the back.
 Far down the street, his robe flowing in a nonexistent wind, walked a pale man dressed in black.
 His low hood covered all but the chin of his face.
 His gait was slow and steady.
 He kept one hand outstretched, and from it flowed a black river that branched out to form the shield that had kept the men alive.
 No arrows fired.
 The battle was at a standstill, all because of this mysterious stranger who walked so calmly down the street.
 ‚ÄúMen of Neldar!‚Äù this man screamed, sounding like a giant among mortal humans.

 Not trusting my voice, I nodded and took the couple of steps needed to reach his passenger door.
 "I wanted to apologize for what happened earlier today.
 Cassie can be a real jerk sometimes."
 It was too good to be true.
 I almost looked over at him, but I knew I'd lose myself in a pair of soft, gray eyes.
 Brandon seemed to understand that my silence meant I wasn't convinced.
 "You wouldn't believe how relieved I was when you stepped forward and stopped her before things got out of hand."
 My natural pessimism reasserted itself, undaunted by the fact that I could just see Brandon's exquisitely-muscled arm out of the corner of my eye.

 He shook his head and nodded over to the dragon.

I didn't know what to make of her.
 She looked like the type who was always on the fringe of the popular crowd.

 I mumbled a response, something that wasn't rude, but which couldn't be mistaken as pleading for friendship.

 ‚ÄúBecause I am wondering if our ‚ÄòPaladin‚Äô has a connection to the Dire Cats.

 She tried to yell at me and it came out, ‚ÄúThut uhp!

 Harruq halted before the mess that had been his prey.
 The line of undead stood motionless, their unfocused eyes looking nowhere.
 The wind blew through them, shifting their hair and whistling through the holes in their bodies.
 The half- orc said nothing, just stared at the carnage and the servants of his master as he waited for Qurrah.
 The mindless rage that had consumed him slowly faded.
 By the time his brother arrived, it was all but a memory.
 ‚ÄúThe undead took them,‚Äù Qurrah said, his breath quick and shallow.

Water productivity can be enhanced by raising crop productivity as well as by adoption of deep chiselling technologies that enhance water retention in the soil.
 It can also be improved by shifting to more water efficient crops, such as replacing sugarcane wherever possible with sugar beet, which consumes 60 per cent less water per unit of sugar produced.
 Safety Nets: Long-term solution to the problem of food security requires efforts that will make people food self-sufficient.
 But until those efforts can be put in place and made effective, continued reliance will have to be placed on public programmes such as India‚Äôs highly successful Mid-Day Meal scheme for school children and Food for Work programs that combine employment and food security.
 The traditional concept of Food for Work needs to be enlarged to include skilled work related to human and social development.
 A Global Food Guarantee scheme should be put in place, which combines Food for Work and Employment Guarantee in a systematic manner.
 Human Development
 Development is a human process.
 It is the result of human aspirations turned into action, human energies expressed in thought and work, human imagination and creativity turned toward the upliftment of life, the invention of processes and products to enhance human productivity, the accumulation of knowledge and wisdom passed on from one generation to another, the acquisition and perfection of skills transmitted from parent to child, the conversion of talents into capacities, the pursuit of ideals, an ever widening of attitudes, and the evolution of more complex and productive forms of organization.
 As this evolutionary process unfolds, each element of human personality -- physical skill, vital relationship, mental understanding, spiritual values ‚Äì is enhanced in a progression without end, bringing with it greater material fruits, richer life experience, and higher knowledge.

It felt and sounded like metal bands inside my mind, inside my ears, screeching.
 I hadn‚Äôt opened my eyes again and now I couldn‚Äôt.
 I couldn‚Äôt find my body; I wanted to bring my hands to my head, cover my ears.
 But I couldn‚Äôt feel anything aside from the pain in my mind.
 I focused all of my energy on finding some feeling somewhere and finally, though the terror was unrelenting, I felt my body again, knew it was there.
 It still didn‚Äôt respond, but I knew I hadn‚Äôt fallen with the horse.

We hid under a pool table and talked about Eric and our dubious futures.
 Karen didn't care to join us for yet another party at Black's Beach, a place only accessible by a trail down a high sea cliff, where police never showed to bust rowdy kids for drinking.
 So around dawn, I rode shotgun while Cliff drove and Lucas Field and Carol Stuhr napped in back.
 We were on Murphy Canyon Road, a two-lane without sidewalks or curbs, bordered by vacant, hilly land.
 I dosed off.
 Then Cliff joined the rest of us.
 The parked station wagon we rammed might've saved our lives, as it kept the convertible from running up the side of a bank and flipping onto our heads.
 The station wagon was wrecked, Bob's Ford was totaled, and the four of us got cited on account of the case of beer in the trunk, which was meant for the beach party.
 Maybe in consideration of it being our prom-night, the police dropped charges on the condition that Cliff agreed to pay off the station wagon owner.
 I offered to split the pay off.

But that pleasure had frightened her, because it was wrong.
 She was betrothed to Davis.
 When she was dressed, she put her betrothal ring back on.
 She shouldn't have left it off last night.
 And she should have asked Rick to set an alarm for her so that she could have walked in the garden this morning.
 She shouldn't skip any mornings; she never knew which day might be the one when she'd find herself back in 1927.
 When she went downstairs, Rick was watching television.
 "Want to watch `Bonanza'?"
 he asked.
 "OK." He glanced at her, bemused, when she sat down on the far end of the sofa.

 There was no more talking, each had plenty of their own thoughts to mull over.
 Rodregas was feeling pretty good at the moment, dangerously positive.
 He had learned long ago that the better you felt, the harder came the emotional fall.
 He knew this was all too good to last, but knowing that it would not last also made it more important that he enjoy the moment.

Did he really hate me so much just because I'd told him off about not protecting Rachel?
 Cassie was waiting for me at my locker when I got there.
 "Brandon wanted me to stop by and let you know he had a few things to take care of, so he won't see you during lunch.
 You can still come sit with us if you want."
 The words were right.
 If I'd been reading them off of a page in a book, I probably would've believed them, but the way she delivered them left no doubt in my mind.
 She didn't want me at their table.

 She was still in bed, awake but numb, when her mother tapped on her door the next morning.
 "Marie?

 "Yes.

 Mrs. Tranton went to sit on the edge of the bed.

 She hadn't even thought about binding her chest again, a convention that her mother had never understood or liked.

 Besides, she liked wearing the lacy bras she'd brought from 2011.

I've noticed you've been working on the older material during class, which I very much approve of, but you may want to listen today.
 We're starting a new section, and it should be fairly straightforward for you to pick up."
 I shouldn't have been surprised when she turned out to be right.
 The new chapter was on probability, which had absolutely nothing to do with the stuff they'd been working on the week before.
 I quickly decided I didn't like the new stuff as much as what I'd been studying on my own, but it was relatively easy, and almost before I knew it class had ended and it was time to go to lunch.
 My doubts about whether or not everyone would be back in school today after three nights of partying were quickly resolved as Britney and I tried to fight through the ridiculous foot traffic on our way to our lockers.
 By the time we made it to the lunch room, I was heartily sick of dodging jocks with shoulders the size of an ox.
 Why on earth did every single one of them think it was necessary to mock fight, throw balls back and forth to each other, or otherwise make a spectacle of themselves?
 My mood was further soured as we arrived to find an unmistakable circle of bystanders signaling an impending fight.
 My first instinct was to go find a teacher before the two idiots hurt each other, but while I was still looking around to see if there was an adult in the room, Britney grabbed my arm and pulled me towards the circle.

 Another thing hasn‚Äôt changed about drug deals in all the years since my last: Buyers are always late to arrive and usually short on cash with lame excuses throughout the process.
 I am expecting $2500 in cash as agreed and I hope that the deal goes smoothly so I can go home safely to my wife and sons.
 I don‚Äôt want any problems, and I don‚Äôt want to see any weapons.
 Drug dealing has never been an honorable profession, so anything could happen.
 Though I have never met the buyer, I have been assured by his girlfriend that he will have the money and the deal will take only a few minutes.
 I also know that Ashley is seriously addicted to Oxy.
 After we first met‚Äîat her apartment‚Äîshe called me several times just to get a few pills to hold her over until we could meet for this drug deal.
 I have refused her every time as I have told her that we will meet just the one time and exchange all the drugs for the money at once.
 She has tried to entice me with her young body in exchange for a couple Oxy, but I have resisted the temptation.

 But I forced those thoughts away, counting steps as I ran.
 I was miles from home.
 A home I might never return to.
 I pushed myself forward through the day, only stopping when I found a patch of sweet berries and a small, babbling creek.
 The berries were wild, small and much less palatable without the guiding hand of an elf, but the water I‚Äôd gathered from the stream was cool and refreshing.
 As evening approached, so grew the underlying discomfort with the idea of the coming darkness.

Instead of working toward the power of sorcery, they underwent the Sigil ceremony, gaining a magical enhancement but losing the versatility of a true mage.
 Gaining such sigils was outlawed by the guide except for their own warriors, but the Order of the Soaring Heavens was also the traditional sources for the Gods own Paladins, and even the Celestial Guild had never dared to anger the gods by interfering with their use of sigils.
 Rigoria had been one of the greatest of the Order of the Soaring Heavens, but he had grown old and his health had failed him.
 When tempted by the Immortalists with a new body, he had accepted.
 Even though such action was anathema to the very teachings of the Order, he had become an officer of the Immortal Guards, and eventually their leader.
 Several of the most powerful Knights had over the centuries, formed the officer core of The Immortal Guards.
 These Knights traded their honor for near immortality in the Guards.
 The Immortal Guards were all sigil warriors with one or several magical enhancements.
 They also had the best resources of the entire Eastern Realm, the most powerful enchanted armor, the best weapons; their officers rode Dire Beasts for steeds.
 Taking on a sigil warrior would be a huge challenge for Rodregas, or at least he thought it would be.

He thanked them.
 I think the arrest helped him realize how long the police had been after him and how much they knew about him and that dealers he knew were working for the police.
 After rehab when his head was clear, and he knew how close he came to dying or going to prison, I think he respected what the police were doing.
 By then, several more of his friends had died from an OD or were in rehab or prison.
 We chatted and the officers said that they called Brandon the ‚Äúone percent kid‚Äù due to his progress through recovery.
 They also joked about how I was still the talk of the narcotics and uniform officers as this crazy father who went undercover to save his son‚Äôs ass.
 It was an odd gathering but I know the officers enjoyed it and I know they appreciated that their efforts had a positive result on someone.
 While we had Brandon home for this brief time we also attended a family wedding.
 The four of us, Brandon, Bryce, Lisa and myself, drove together several hours north to a coastal town in northern California.
 We all stayed in the same quaint roadside motel near a popular camping spot called Patrick‚Äôs Point.

Sitting there staring at them was about the worst of all the choices open to me, but I was too shocked to pull my eyes away.
 I felt a surge of heat rush through me as the room wavered slightly.
 For a second I worried I was going to pass out, but movement behind the two punks distracted me from my heaving internal landscape.
 There was just enough light for me to see Alec lean forward and put a hand on each troublemaker's shoulder.
 There was an abortive movement by the two loudmouths, as they tried to spin around and confront him.
 Granted, the lighting was less than ideal, but it didn't look like Alec was holding onto them very hard.
 Still, neither of them made it more than a quarter of the way around before being slammed back down into their chairs.
 The tingly heat that'd convinced me Alec was staring at me earlier was back, and even more intense.
 I felt the tiny hairs on my neck stand up as the feeling redoubled yet again.
 The darker, more vocal of the two opened his mouth and got the first part of a swear word out before ending in a hiss of pain that was almost completely drowned out by a crescendo from the orchestra pit.

Velixar accepted a stab deep into his chest.
 A pale hand grabbed Dieredon‚Äôs throat, its grip iron and its flesh ice.
 ‚ÄúIt will be painful,‚Äù Velixar said.
 Vile magic swirled about his hand, pouring into Dieredon‚Äôs neck.
 The blood in his veins clotted and thickened.
 A toss of his hand and the elf flew through the air.
 He rolled across the ground without the usual grace he had shown in combat.
 Qurrah glanced about, paralyzed with fear.
 The remaining elves were returning, deadly and furious, and the darkness that had protected them was gone.
 ‚ÄúDo you feel it?‚Äù Velixar said, stalking over to the dying elf.

Rodregas felt that Ravenhurr saw in everyone else a lesser person whose best function was to be used by his betters.
 Rodregas looked over the rooftop following Ravenhurr‚Äôs eyes.
 Most of the open flat roof of the tower was covered in various circles.
 The largest circle held all the others and was made of a glittering white sand-like substance.
 Its diameter had been drawn as large as possible within the limitations of the roof‚Äôs edges.
 On the inside were sigils, runes, and small candles set out every few feet.
 Rodregas knew enough of magic to understand that the purpose of this circle was to keep out unwanted magical influences.
 They could interfere with the spell casting inside the circle.
 Also, the circle would hold in any magical forces inside which someone wanted to store or manipulate.
 Inside the large circle were four smaller circles.

No answer again.
 ‚ÄúSeth is there something wrong?‚Äù I whispered.
 He didn‚Äôt answer me again.
 He continued to stare at the woods as if he expected a flying deer to leap out, wearing pink socks.
 ‚ÄúWhat the heck Seth, are you deaf now?‚Äù I waited for a sign that he heard me to appear on his face, but it remained blank.
 Emily huffed loudly, ‚ÄúExpect something from Jazell and me soon Jason.
 We‚Äôre out of here.
 See you around.‚Äù She grabbed my hand and pulled me away.
 Seth turned to see me leave and the look gave me a dark feeling inside.
 His face was masked with one emotion, one that made me vow to myself that I would find out what he was hiding, what he was keeping a secret.

"Very well then.
 It's just after ten o'clock.
 Your mom is about to pull into the driveway.
 Do your best to convince her you spent the night safely at home.
 We'll stay here and watch over the two of you.
 Also, if you can convince her it's safe to leave on an extended trip, that would be very helpful.
 Once she's gone, I'll come back for you."
 I opened my mouth to ask him what he meant, only to be distracted by the sound of the Jeep's engine as it rolled to a stop on the cement pad.
 As I looked back, Alec's eyes captured me.
 "You're sure this is what you want?"

Not an iron-clad one, but good enough for now.
 I thanked Brandon for the ride, and was rewarded with one more wide, open smile before we split up and headed our separate ways.
 I kept telling myself not to get caught up in the idea of being with someone for the first time in my life, but still went through the first two classes more or less in a daze.
 Mrs. Sorenson was just as nasty as she'd been every day this week, but I didn't care when she managed to stump me on her second question.
 I found myself subconsciously comparing Heathcliff with Brandon during English, and Mr. Whethers had to ask me a question at least twice before I realized he was talking to me.
 I hardly even blushed at the inevitable giggles.
 I made a mental note to find out from Britney if I'd caught his question on the second or third repetition, but I rather suspected I'd forget.
 In fact, when class finally got out I remembered my question, but just didn't feel like asking.
 Instead, I just wanted to get away from her and the never-ending gossip.
 I waited until she stopped to talk to one of the cheerleaders about who was dating who, and then mumbled something about the bathroom, and made a break for it.

If he did a convincing enough job pretending to like me and I tried really hard, maybe I'd believe it'd all just been my imagination.
 It'd be one less piece of my world crumbling out from under me.
 Britney slammed her tray down, but my listless gaze didn't move from the vacant corner where Brandon usually sat.
 A few minutes later a group of girls came to join us.
 I recognized them, but didn't bother putting names to the faces.
 It was like I got hit with another panic attack.
 Somehow I lost an hour, but nobody was running around calling for an ambulance so I must have at least responded to direct questions.
 Alec was sitting in his normal seat as I wandered into physics.
 I tried to remember whether or not I'd already heard the second bell ring.
 It wasn't important though.

Britney shifted back and forth in her seat for a couple of seconds before leaning in to whisper.
 "It really shouldn't be a big deal, but everyone around here acts like it's taboo.
 Two hikers were killed by some kind of wild animal a few months ago."
 I felt my heart skip a beat as a chill ran from the base of my spine all the way to my scalp.
 Britney's innocuous words shouldn't have caused my mind to immediately sink back to the terror I'd felt this morning, but they did.
 For a moment I couldn't focus on what Britney was saying, my heartbeat had become completely erratic from the surge of adrenaline flooding my body as it futilely tried to escape the nameless things that'd been snapping at my heels.

But, as a teenager I served as a squire of the knightly Order of the Soaring Heavens‚Äù.
 At their nod he added,‚ÄùI was never raised to knighthood, as I had neither the noble lineage nor the martial prowess.
 My life as a squire was a good life, one I appreciated more afterwards than when I was living it.
 Both the knights and the squires always started off the day with a prayer to the Celestial Gods.
 I have not done this in over forty years, but I am going to start again and I would like you to join me if you would.‚Äù The two looked at Rodregas, they were very different people, but they both seemed unsure what to say to his request.
 Finally, Doi‚Äôvan nodded at Imeralda and said to Rodregas, ‚ÄúIt has been too long since I have prayed as well, it would be good for the soul.
 Please lead us in prayer.‚Äù Imeralda did not say anything, but she nodded and followed the two of them outside.
 Rodregas knelt in the grass facing the sun, the sign of the All-Father in the celestial heavens.
 He reached out and wove his fingers together; he pulled his thumbs down and opened his woven hands in the ancient symbol of opening oneself to the gods.
 ‚ÄúDear Celestials in the heavens, we open our hearts to you and we accept our duties as your warriors here in the world.

He did his best to dodge, but he was far less mobile than his brother.
 The arrow pierced between his left shoulder and collarbone, burying the barbed tip deep in his flesh.
 The half-orc let out a stunned gasp.
 He staggered right, clutching his shoulder as he slumped against the front of a home.

 Qurrah shoved away his clumsy attempts to examine the wound.

He went around the room one final time poking around for anything else of note and, finding nothing, went over to the door to the water closet.
 Inside he first tested out the plumbing, finding the experience both new and familiar.
 He also had a chance to examine his own plumbing, and was pleased with the results; his new body was large and powerfully built even in places that most people would not see.
 The only thing of use in the water closet was a shaving kit which Rodregas added to the trunk.
 Next he went to the study door only to find it locked.
 He looked for a key but there was nothing.
 He guessed that it was locked by magic and required a magic word or incantation to open the lock.
 He pushed and pulled on the door, but it was solidly made and there was nothing to get a good hold of to test his new strength.
 He looked around for something to use as a pry bar; next to the fireplace was a poker.
 He grabbed it and forced it into the crack were a normal door would have its catch.

Dominic and Rachel had to tell me I looked good, that was an unwritten girl-rule regardless of what species you were.
 Jessica had no such imperative, so I was forced to conclude Jasmin had done the best she could considering what she had to work with, and resigned myself to being the homely one in the group.
 Still, seeing all of the other girls in one place, fully decked out in the kind of shoes I'd always wanted to wear, but never been able to pull off, was even more intimidating.
 I was once again psyching myself up to be seen in public, when Donovan limped into the room and cleared his throat.
 "The gentlemen have at long last arrived."
 Isaac was the first one through the door, looking particularly 007 in a tux that amazingly enough had the occasional silver thread that matched perfectly with Jessica's dress.
 I looked up from his outfit just in time to see a flash of concern melt away into relief.
 I had just a moment to wonder at the novelty of Isaac showing that much emotion all at one time, and then James stalked through the door in a tux that was so cutting edge, that I wasn't sure if there was anything else like it anywhere in the States.
 The shimmery nature of the fabric combined with an unusually angular, sharp cut to make it different than anything else I'd ever seen.
 I worked my way up from the blindingly-polished black shoes, to the splash of deep red peeking out of his chest pocket, and somewhere along the way decided I loved the tux.

It was my absolute least favorite song on the whole soundtrack.
 Frankly the whole play would've been better if they'd just left it off.
 Still, sitting through a song about 'ladies of the night' as my mom still called them, had seemed like a small price to pay for getting to listen to the rest of the play.
 By the middle of the song both of the oversexed boys behind me were whispering catcalls.
 I felt my ears going red.
 I wanted nothing more than to sink down into my seat and try to ignore them, but once guys got started on something like that, they never stopped.
 Some of the people around me were starting to evidence signs of annoyance, but that just spurred the hecklers on to greater heights.
 I was so worried they were going to ruin everyone's experience, that I turned around and shot them a dirty look.
 "Oh, sweetie, don't you worry, we've been aching to get our hands on you all night.
 We're saving plenty of loving for you later.

 But I was never good at that anyway.
 I shook my head.
 He nodded, giving up, but our hands still lay together, connecting us.

It is unrealistic to expect that any system of international controls or inspections can prevent their eventual acquisition by states that decide to develop them and have the advanced scientific capabilities to do so.
 From the inception of nuclear weapons, two things have been clear.
 There can be no victors in a nuclear war and there is no credible defence against these weapons.
 Confidential studies by NATO in the 1960s concluded that the costs of a nuclear exchange to either party would be so great that the weapons were essentially unusable.
 No satisfactory answer has ever emerged for the question: where and under what circumstances can these weapons be deployed beneficially?
 The continued expansion of nuclear stockpiles over three decades may have added to the self-importance of the military and political leaderships, and perhaps of the general public, in states that possessed them, but there is little evidence that it ever added to national security.
 The unusability of these weapons helps to explain why predictions of rapid spread of these weapons to other states proved to be so wildly exaggerated.
 The irrelevance or unusability of nuclear weapons is evident in all the wars involving major powers during the past four decades.
 A greater understanding of the environmental impact of these weapons has further strengthened the perception of unusability.
 It is time that psychological posturing gave way to a mature recognition that these weapons have no place in the civilized world and must be banished from it.

The sentences should have been a careless mess based on the speed with which he was writing.
 Instead they turned out more even and carefully constructed than anything I'd ever been able to accomplish.
 I'm the Alpha here; you can ask your questions when I finish with mine.
 The flippant, humorous nature of his response was so atypical, and yet still quintessentially Alec.
 I nearly broke into a fit of laughter that would've gotten us both in even more trouble with Mrs. Sorenson.
 I roll my eyes at you...a lot.
 So once you're done, I get to ask you any question?
 No restrictions?
 That was nearly a deal breaker, I could see it by the way his initial smile at my 'rolled eyes' faded away into his more characteristic seriousness.
 He contemplated his response for a good fifteen seconds, which was probably something like two hours in shape shifter time, before finally touching his pen to the paper again and then passing my notebook back.

All four of us stood there waiting and when he got his breath back, he spoke.
 ‚ÄúI am glad that you accepted my message,‚Äù he said to Seth and me.
 Then he turned to Emily and Jason and said, ‚ÄúAh, it‚Äôs great to meet the other two.‚Äù He beamed at all four of us.
 ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù Emily said, looking a little freaked out.
 ‚ÄúSo now that you‚Äôre here, are we going to get a move on or what?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh of course, follow me please.‚Äù He shuffled off and disappeared behind the statue.
 Jason raised an eyebrow.
 ‚ÄúWhere is he going?‚Äù Emily sighed.
 ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only one way to find out.‚Äù She walked behind the statue.
 Seth, Jason, and I followed her.
 As soon as I was on the other side, I gasped at what I saw.

They would not be able to do much more without getting some timber.
 They all worked or read until it was too dark and than they fell asleep quickly.
 The next morning, after they had finished Morning Prayer, Rodregas said, ‚ÄúAlright, are you two ready for a little fighting practice?‚Äù At their nod he added, ‚ÄúIt is always good to start with the basics.
 I thought we would go over some fighting forms.
 Are you two familiar with learning forms, also known as Kata?‚Äù he asked.
 He was expecting Imeralda to shake her head but was a little surprised that Doi‚Äôvan did as well.
 He clearly knew how to fight.
 Rodregas started to explain, ‚ÄúForms are a series of motions that mock fighting, but also give you an opportunity to work on balance and to visualize and understand your actions and responses to different fighting situations.
 While strength and speed are important for any kind of fighting whether it is hand-to-hand or swords fighting, good technique is all about balance and center of gravity.
 What you want to learn is to keep your center low and your balance strong even when you are tired and exhausted.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan had his normal interested expression, but Imeralda looked unconvinced.

She assured him she was all his.
 For some weeks, he allowed her to rest on that answer, but more and more she became uneasy with it, until she realized she didn‚Äôt by any means belong entirely to God.
 Most of her thoughts, concerns and energies went to her family.
 She was the mom of three wonderful kids and the wife of a loving husband.
 In horror, she returned to intense and persistent prayer, telling God he couldn‚Äôt possibly mean she should leave her family, could he?
 Rather than reply with words, he used silence, like Tae Kwon Do Master Jeong used to do when one of us students offered an excuse for not training often enough.
 For weeks she waited, listened, and prayed God would at last reply that he had only been using the method through which he tested Abraham‚Äôs willingness to obey at any cost.
 Once she declared herself ready to forsake her family, he would release her from the need to do so.
 But he didn‚Äôt release her.
 She gathered together her husband and kids, all of whom she adored and treasured.

The name slid out of me almost of its own accord.
 "Monster Lake."
 Every single birthday I could remember had involved some kind of trip out to Monster Lake.
 Picnics had swapped off with treasure hunts and then been replaced by other activities depending on Dad's mood and my age.
 My subconscious had keyed in on the one scene guaranteed to make me feel miserable.
 "Was that close to your house in Minnesota?
 I..." Whatever else Alec was saying was lost to the roar in my ears, caused as always by my racing heart.
 I didn't even have a chance to try and fight the attack.
 By the time I realized I was in trouble, papers were flying off my desk and the floor was racing up to meet me.
 Rather than swimming around in blackness like I normally did when collapsed, this time there was just nothing.

Part of me wanted to scream for joy, to jump up out of my bed and wrap myself around Alec as tightly as I could, but I was just too far gone.
 I half thought I was dreaming it all.
 As I finally let sleep pull me down into darkness, I almost thought I heard Alec say one last thing.
 The tone was so vulnerable and hesitant he almost sounded like another person.
 "The truth is, I've fallen well and truly in love with you."
 Chapter 23 Someone was calling my name, but I really didn't want to wake up.
 I was still so tired, and I'd had the most wonderful dreams.
 They were a little foggy now, but they seemed to have involved Alec coming to my rescue, and then holding my hand as I went to sleep.
 It wasn't until I finally placed the familiar voice that everything started coming back to me.
 I sat up with an abruptness that nearly knocked Alec off of his perch on the edge of my bed.

‚ÄúWhat?
 What did you find?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I was just‚Ä¶ there was a thistle here‚Ä¶‚Äù It was all that had developed, the bulbs and seedlings were undisturbed, and I couldn‚Äôt help but think, Oh, sure, the weed grows.
 Junnie was across the room in a flash.
 She glanced at the changed thistle and then, briefly, me, but when I tried to meet her gaze, it shifted to the wall of books.
 ‚ÄúWell, good for you, Frey.
 Your efforts are finally paying off.‚Äù I stared blankly at her.
 ‚ÄúWhat do you say we wrap it up for today?
 I‚Äôve got some business with Council.‚Äù I stumbled off the stool, half numb from being still so long, and made my way outside into the warm sun, unsure of my direction.
 The idea of lingering within sight of the village center didn‚Äôt have much appeal, but I was in no hurry to get back home to Fannie.
 Choosing instead a rambling, rarely used path out of the village, I found myself wandering idly through the trees and, eventually, into an abandoned, overgrown garden, where I tried to work out what to do with my now empty afternoon.

The Dire Cats then circled the main building and went over to the far edge of the main house and then simply disappeared.
 Rodregas said, ‚ÄúI think they just went into the cellar of the home.
 The entrance is over there.
 Come on, let‚Äôs get the horses over to the old barn and get them set for the night before it gets too dark.‚Äù ‚ÄúAre those the two Dire Cats from Raven Keep?‚Äù asked Imeralda.
 As she spoke she shook her long auburn hair behind her, something he was starting to realize was a nervous gesture.
 ‚ÄúYes, I think so,‚Äù Rodregas said.
 ‚ÄúI freed them from the dungeon before I left, and then I thought I saw them yesterday.
 Apparently, everyone in the dungeon is following me,‚Äù he said with a chuckle.
 ‚ÄúYou saw them?‚Äù asked Doi‚Äôvan.

 A few humans stuck their heads out their doors to glimpse the armored men trampling through their city.
 Most kept themselves far from danger.

 ‚ÄúBy order of the noble and sovereign King of Neldar, all elven kind has been banned from human lands.
 The elves of Woodhaven have ignored this edict, ignored the laws of the great kingdom in which they live.
 This will not be tolerated any longer.
 All elves must leave the city, which being outside the forest of Erze, falls inside our borders.
 Those who do not immediately leave will be forced out at the edge of a sword.

I caught Chevelle‚Äôs expression as I glared at her.
 He had seen what she was doing, knew her motives most likely, but I could tell he thought it had worked.
 He thought I was jealous.
 Perfect.
 I smelled something odd and glanced down.
 The meat I was holding had burnt in my hand.
 I cursed, dropping it onto the plate.
 When I looked back to them, Steed was watching me, smiling.
 I tossed the burned meat onto the table, considering going back to bed.

 "I think he'll propose soon.

 Mrs. Tranton managed to maintain a pensive expression for a few seconds but then smiled at her daughter.
 "Yes.
 And I think a September wedding would be perfect."
 They discussed bridesmaids and flowers and gardens.
 Marie would wear her mother's wedding gown, which had been carefully stored away for the last 28 years.
 Marie's grandmother had worn it as well, and when Marie took it off after her own wedding, it would go into storage for her daughter.

The few times I looked up, I saw Britney, who seemed determined not to give in and actually do her homework.
 I finished my two assignments about the time I normally did, and walked over to where Mrs. Campbell was trying to explain a story problem.
 The sophomore she was helping looked like he wanted to be anywhere other than trying to figure out how long it would take Sally to mow the lawn given a certain width of lawn mower moving at a given rate of speed.
 "Oh, Adriana.
 Go ahead and walk around looking for students who need help.
 Most everyone will leave in the next ten minutes or so, but we're actually open for another hour."
 She was right.
 Nearly everyone left over the next little while as they either finished up their assignments, gave up, or finally filled whatever quota of study time they'd been given by their parents.
 I did get to answer a couple of questions, which was surprisingly fun.
 When there was only half an hour left Mrs. Campbell walked over.

 It took a while for her to get the hang of it, but an hour or so later, she was cruising around the parking lot, making reasonably smooth starts and stops.
 Rick was glad to see that her initial difficulties had made her cautious.
 That should curb her excitement when she got out on the road.

CHAPTER 6 LUNCH WITH THE ENEMY
 With an eager stride, Van‚Äôdret climbed up the stairs to the rooftop solar of the Guild Dealer Taiga‚Äôs tower fortress...
 He was excited by the honor to dine with the great Immortalist.
 He followed a servant dressed in expensive silks of a drab brown color through the well lit passageways and stairs, all the while nervously straightening his own expensive wardrobe.
 As they approached the top of the tower, the servant silently stepped aside and, with an open palm, waived Van‚Äôdret forward.
 The top of the stairs had a small platform where two massive Immortal Guards stood.
 At first they showed no signs of movement, though Van‚Äôdret could feel their eyes on him as they weighed his right to enter the private solar of their master.
 In their full plate Night Bronze, the two guardsmen who stood perfectly still at full attention looked to be more statues than actual men, and something that was not beyond the magic of the man was whose door they guarded.
 The double doors leading to the private solar were also of Night Bronze, however the door was covered in intricate wards and symbols.
 The guardsmen's armor was less decorated and held only an engraving of their sigil animals.

 The mood in Woodhaven grew somber as dark rumors spread.
 First came word that troops were on their way to enforce an edict evicting all elves from the city.
 The more this rumor spread, the more elves seemed to arrive.
 Elven men and women with camouflage and great longbows patrolled the city.
 Even more lingered in taverns and the homes of kin.
 Many humans left for the homes of family and friends, wanting no part of the coming conflict, while others spent hours whispering with the elf men in the bars.
 The tension grew.
 A group of men, not daring to admit where their pay came from, built sturdy palisades between the two halves of town.

It was quiet there and I wondered if I had cracked.
 But then it occurred to me that maybe I had been the cause of it.
 I was resigned now, the fury gone, and so was the screeching, the pain.
 They had said the binding was dangerous‚Ä¶ There was a collective gasp as they realized I was back.
 I heard someone beside me and a flash of anger swept through me, lighting a flame at whoever it was.
 So maybe the fury wasn‚Äôt completely gone.
 I suddenly remembered the pages I had burnt in the briar patch so long ago.
 Burnt before I‚Äôd read them.
 My eyes flashed open.
 I sat up, ignoring my spinning head, but the book was already gone.

8.Launch a massive programme to impart new skills and attitudes to the population: In countries where private enterprise was extinguished for decades, entrepreneurial, financial and marketing skills can be extremely limited.
 An analysis should be undertaken of the types and levels of skills needed for transition to a market system, covering areas such as entrepreneurship, management, national and international marketing, strategic business planning, finance, quality control, product development, production technology, design, and human resource development.
 Experience in former colonial nations where entrepreneur ship was also stifled for a long period indicates that a profound change in attitude is necessary before people will risk leaving or forego seeking salaried and pensioned jobs in favour of self-employment, even when the salaried jobs are scarce or unavailable.
 Such a basic change of attitude, which normally requires a change of generation, can be accelerated by a massive programme of public information, education and demonstration spanning several years.
 9.Study the benefits of economic recovery on world trade: Recessionary trends are affecting many parts of the world today.
 The prognosis in the West, especially in the European Union, is for slow growth during the 1990s.
 The progress of developing countries is impeded by slow growth in the industrialized nations and the collapse of Eastern Europe.
 What would be the impact on the world economy of a rapid recovery and economic expansion in the countries of the region?
 What would be the result elsewhere of further decline in Eastern Europe?
 These questions are of vital relevance to the entire world.

 "I'll call Alec; he'll know what to do."
 She was still whispering, but the words sheared through the darkness, arresting my fall.
 I didn't want him here, didn't want to give him another reason to despise me.
 What if Jasmin came with him?
 The thought of lying helpless with her in the same room sent shivers of cold sliding down me.
 I couldn't see, so I reached out, blindly trying to find the phone before Rachel could dial Alec.
 My questing hand finally found the tiny, hard-plastic package, and I grabbed on with all of my fading strength.
 The darkness was still beckoning, but alternating images of Jasmin and Alec flashed before my eyes.
 I was so confused that I couldn't make sense of the flood of emotions that accompanied the pictures, other than the fact that terror came to the forefront as they sped up.

 And who can blame them after he ruined Tokyo so many times.
 But anyways Rusty said that most older Japanese people will just soil their shorts even at the mention of their old nemesis.
 Not only that, but everyone knows the name Godzilla.

 Half the time I felt like there was an entire conversation being carried on over my head, but sitting next to Brandon left me with such a tingly feeling all along my right side that I didn't really mind.
 Not even the presence of a pop quiz in History managed to faze me.
 Almost before I knew it I was sitting down in Physics.
 As usual, Alec slipped into class a half second before the bell.
 I was so happy I forgot how arrogant he was, and I smiled at him as he sat down.
 It was like he was looking at something that wasn't even human.
 My insides seemed to freeze and shrink.
 I couldn't even muster up my normal blush of embarrassment.
 I'd had plenty of people hate me since I'd arrived in Sanctuary, but he was the first person I'd met who I was convinced wouldn't have thrown me a life preserver if I was drowning.

Based on the precedent of the Chemical Weapons Treaty, the proposal for a universal ban on the possession of nuclear weapons by any nation should be placed before the Security Council for a vote.
 The five permanent members should agree to the suspension of their veto power on this issue so crucial to the future of humanity.
 8.The danger to all nations of unexpected and unprovoked attack from near or distant powers can be vastly reduced by declaring an immediate ban on the use of ballistic missiles of all types, including those carrying conventional war heads.
 This would eliminate the discriminatory provisions that deny missile acquisition to some while preserving the right of others to maintain and develop this purely offensive capability.
 It would also eliminate the need for missile defence systems, which no nation can afford and which are the only possible defence against ballistic missile weapons.
 The ban on use should be followed by urgent measures to dismantle and scrap this entire class of weapons worldwide.
 9.Highest priority must be given to controlling and reversing the proliferation of small arms in line with the determined international measures employed to curb hijacking.
 As an immediate first step, these weapons should be classified and a UN register created to monitor their manufacture and sale.
 Agreements should be negotiated between major arms suppliers to severely restrict production and sales.
 Strong sanctions must be instituted to discourage states from actively or passively abetting small arms proliferation, especially to non-state actors.

 She smiled, but all at once her smile dissolved into an uncomfortable blush.

Amazingly enough, Isaac and Jessica were far and away the best; he was leading her through steps that were at least twice as hard as anything we were trying.
 For maybe the first time I'd ever seen, Jessica was happy.
 She seemed completely in her element, utterly oblivious to the number of people watching her every move, and I felt just a little of my resentment dissolve.
 "You're all such good dancers.
 How did that happen?"
 Alec released my waist and spun me out and back in without missing a single step.

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù he asked trying to act calm and in control.
 ‚ÄúWe might lose some guards and probably some of the kitchen drudges if they have money in hand and a whole week off, also we leave ourselves open for theft if we don‚Äôt keep at least a minimum of guards at the front gate.‚Äù Rodregas relaxed at the mundane nature of the questions.
 ‚ÄúTrue, but I will not stint in thanking the gods for a favorable ceremony.
 Keep a few guards at the gate, but only the minimum needed.
 But that does remind me.
 Release any remaining prisoners and make sure they are fed and clothed, and allow them to make their way back to their homes.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat has some danger to it,‚Äù said Captain Poir hurriedly, his expression returning to a look of concern.
 ‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù he replied.
 ‚ÄúBut do as I command,‚Äù Rodregas stated in his firmest voice.
 Captain Poir nodded and immediately said, ‚ÄúAs you command, master.‚Äù Rodregas started to open the door to the stairway when another thought hit him, and he turned back to the captain, and said, ‚ÄúI need time to adjust.
 Make sure that I am not disturbed in my quarters tonight, but tell Adapt Korin that before he leaves to celebrate, to come up to my room for some last minute instructions.‚Äù Captain Poir responded with his very military, ‚ÄúYes sir.‚Äù  Rodregas had to admit while most of the guards were no better trained than a ruffian off the street the captain had served with The Immortal Guards and he was highly trained and disciplined.

For a moment it seemed he was going to shake her off again but then he shuddered, shot Alec another dirty look, and stormed out of the room.
 The tiny form following after him looked like a fragile schooner trailing along the edge of a hurricane.
 The room seemed so calm after James disappeared that for a second I forgot Jessica was still half-crouched in the center of the room.
 Alec hadn't forgotten, and if the waves of tension and energy rolling off of him weren't as strong as the combined effects coming from all four of them, it still felt like the walls should explode outwards.
 Jessica seemed to shrink in on herself, and then she turned and ran away with a final hiss of defiance.
 Isaac looked up at Alec from the corner where he'd been quietly standing.
 Alec's almost imperceptible nod sent him in the same direction as Jessica.
 Whatever meager survival instincts I had left chose that moment to finally kick in, and I felt my knees begin to give way.
 Rachel let out a high-pitched sound that had all of the surprise of a squeal, but none of the excitement.
 Apparently Alec knew how to interpret it.

So there was absolutely no point in falling in love with her.
 Marie found herself thinking about Rick all the time that week.
 He was always smiling, always kind and gentle.
 He showed her new things he thought she'd like and took her places and bought her gifts.
 But what she enjoyed most was just being with him.
 He made her feel special.
 And he was protective without making her feel confined.
 He called her every day at lunch and sometimes later in the afternoon.
 Last week he'd been concerned about her, worried about how she was getting along in a strange place.
 But now they chatted and made plans for the evening.

It's a deal.
 When I finish up with my questions, you can ask whatever you want.
 Of course if your question is something that's going to get you into trouble, I reserve the right to pack you onto a plane and send you off to safety once I'm done answering.
 I stuck my tongue out at him, for real this time, as I wrote down my response.
 Bully.
 Still, all in all it was a win for me.
 Once he'd dug up every painful moment from my childhood, I was going to get to finally start learning about him.
 His pack too of course, but most importantly, I'd finally know more of what made Alec Graves tick.
 A couple of hours later at lunch, Mrs. Campbell had met the appearance of Rachel, Alec, and the rest of the pack with a raised eyebrow and a disbelieving headshake, but simply motioned them all over to the other side of the room, and handed me my test.

Values that foster productivity, organization and social cohesion.
 Skills that improve quality and productivity.
 Successful systems that improve efficiency and expand activities.
 Organizations that promote cooperation, coordination and broaden the sphere of activity.
 Environmentally friendly technologies that can be widely adopted.
 Social attitudes that foster self-confidence, individual initiative, and positive responses to new opportunities.
 Development-oriented laws, policies and programmes that can be more fully implemented.
 A huge surge in development can be achieved if every socially available resource and potential is fully utilized by the people ‚Äì if every capable youth, male and female, continues education up to the level of his or her highest aptitude; if every family employs all the health care knowledge and best practices known by the society; if every government self-employment programme and training programme is fully utilized; if all known technology for improving agriculture is widely publicized and put into practice; if every successful system and institution is replicated and applied to full advantage.
 The highest priority must be to evolve strategies for utilizing these vast social resources more effectively.
 The magnitude of this potential is illustrated by the enormous gap, referred to earlier, between average yields on major food crops achieved by poor developing countries in Asia and Africa and the yields obtained by the world‚Äôs most productive producers.

The only thing I was sure of was that neither intended to lose.
 Their stances, right down to their gazes, were absolutely unwavering.
 A sound behind me drew attention to how quiet the valley had grown as we watched this unanimated brawl.
 And in an instant, how still.
 Steed and Chevelle broke their stare, turning to the noise‚Äîdogs, I thought‚Äîbefore the entire world shifted into action.
 Ruby was gone, vanished from beside me, and I was whisked from my seat, catching only a glimpse of Steed and Chevelle darting past.
 In less than a heartbeat, I was standing over the rocks in the opposite direction, Ruby before me, red curls blocking my view, arms outstretched in readiness.
 Steed and Chevelle were at opposite angles in front of us, both tensed, even more so than they had been in their bout.
 I peered around Ruby‚Äôs mane to see what they were focused on.
 In front of our triangle, directly ahead of Ruby, stood a reedy, blond elf, draped in the long white robe and tassels of council.

There is nothing more glamorous about this drug than heroin.
 The same addiction, the same diseases, the same low-down disgusting lying homeless in the alley and piss your pants drug‚ÄîOxy is essentially synthetic heroin.
 And the last step, when addicts can no longer afford Oxy, is to get on heroin.
 Lives are ruined or lost completely to this drug, which, unlike the drugs of the past, is found in the medicine cabinets of parents, grandparents and patients with severe pain all over this world.
 Some of these patients lose their prescription unsuspectingly to family members or caregivers who steal it for the street value.
 Other patients have discovered the street value so they beg their medical providers for more, claiming their pain has escalated and they need it more frequently to stop their suffering; then, they sell it.
 The young couple coming to buy my Oxy know me as the latter‚Äîan old guy with a script.
 I know they are both addicts and I know the boyfriend, Steve, is a big time Oxy dealer, selling it faster than he can get it.

 Some people claimed to have traveled into the past, but they had no real proof.

 There was no place for the eye to rest, no blank walls, no white spaces.
 And this is like Lorelei herself, really, she is made up of so many parts, she‚Äôs a Steppenwolf, in the best sense of that word, a house of mirrors, each part of her reflects a different part of yourself once you get to know her or her you, you dig?
 Anyway, I spent a good half-hour just looking around, while she stood aside and observed me.
 I was spellbound, pixilated.
 It was a ramshackle, poor man‚Äôs Kubla Kahn.
 I walked slowly around her little apartment, which was like some chthonic art gallery, lit by phosphorous.
 She had art reproductions by Klee, Gironella, Motherwell, Picabia, Bacon, this weird Malcolm Morley yellow pages thing, Ensor, on and on.

Today people still talk about Lorelei Enos with a wary reticence.

 What happened there is shrouded in mystery, except Skippy recalls Buddy saying, ‚ÄúShe had the most beautiful sex I‚Äôve ever seen.

 And its musk stayed on me for days, like it had gone subcutaneous, like it had replaced my own body odor.‚Äù Perhaps this was her hex: Ruthah: The perfume of Immortality.

This guard did.
 The Immortal Guard had already launched himself forward and Rodregas‚Äô own speed worked against him.
 As Rodregas‚Äô short sword hit nothing but air, he felt the sharp agony of the guard‚Äôs blade piercing his thigh.
 Rodregas used his speed to throw himself back.
 But as he did, he felt another sharp cut hit his upper arm.
 The other men were moving in now that he was off balance.
 Rodregas twisted as he fell and grabbed one of the slavers and brought him down.
 With a quick stab into his groin, Rodregas took the slaver out of commission.
 Rodregas rolled off his squirming body and threw himself up to a standing position.
 He almost immediately went down again as his wounded thigh buckled under him.

 ‚ÄúRodregas,‚Äù she said slowly, ‚Äúwe are not doing this for vanity right?‚Äù Rodregas nodded, he sensed she knew the answer to the question but was going somewhere with the question.
 She looked around to make sure others in the arena could not overhear.
 ‚ÄúWe attacked a slave caravan simply because there were children and innocents that needed rescuing though the odds were against us.‚Äù Rodregas nodded again.
 ‚ÄúOn the way here I passed the healers tent,‚Äù she continued.
 ‚ÄúThe healers have cleaned the wounds and cast their healing chants and spells, but I think some of them won‚Äôt make it.
 I think we should use the minor Sigil of Healing on them, at least the most critical of them.‚Äù She paused at Rodregas‚Äô surprised look and then quickly added, ‚ÄúI know it is illegal for anyone but the Immortalists or the Order to use sigils, but that is a law made by the Immortalists!‚Äù ‚ÄúBut Imeralda,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan, ‚Äúthe final competition of the tournament is tomorrow and he is very close to earning knighthood and a greater sigil.‚Äù Though he spoke in opposition his tone was flat as if he simply weighed facts.
 Rodregas froze for a moment, and then simply nodded.
 He had made this decision the moment he took on a body that was not his.
 He was either a monster now, or he was a warrior fighting for justice.

Alec's established clear dominance to everyone else here, but he still probably couldn't make his gentler rules stick if it weren't for the fact that Isaac backs him almost without question."
 The object of our discussion was currently backing away from James while trying to keep Jessica from circling around behind him.
 I finally realized what I'd always thought of as grace was really an economy of motion.
 It was like he was saving every possible bit of energy because he never knew when he'd find it necessary to burn up his reserves in a blaze of violence.
 Even as I watched, he spun around, plucking Jessica out of the air, grabbing her by the head mid-leap as she sought to find purchase on this throat.
 He tried to spin back around to meet James' rush, but the smaller hybrid knocked him down with a crash.
 Isaac and Jasmin were there in a blink, tearing the other two wolves off of Alec before the conflict could turn deadly.
 I couldn't breathe until the dust settled, and Alec rolled back up to his feet, dripping blood from a large gash in his side.
 Dominic heard my sudden gasp and reached over to reassure me.
 "He's okay.

Harruq stayed far from Celed, the elven side of town, since they sent all their children to be raised in Nellassar, deep in the heart of the Erze forest.
 It was the human children, especially the poor and the destitute, that Harruq sought.
 Of course, none would be out playing, not with so many dead and missing.
 He would need to take different measures.
 Not far from their home, a ratty building operated throughout the night.
 It was Maggie‚Äôs Place, half tavern and half orphanage.
 Maggie enjoyed the free labor and the ability to rant and slap her orphan workers without fear of reprisal while still maintaining the image of a heart of gold to her regulars.
 The tavern filled the first floor, while the orphanage and a few modest rooms for rent composed the second.
 Harruq stepped into the alley beside the tavern and looked up.

As we talked I described to her that I had a very controlling wife and two young children at home.
 I told her this because I needed to set some restrictive boundaries; I knew I would need to work within the confines of the narcotics officers, and this would allow me to put her off, buy some time, if I needed it.
 She talked with me and continued to massage my chest as she straddled my naked body.
 She reached for my hands and placed them on her young firm breasts.
 It was an unexpected treat for ‚Äúan old guy with a script‚Äù.
 I‚Äôll let you use your imagination from there, but she finished her massage and then we both got dressed.
 The fish was in the net.
 The girl, Ashley, had taken the bait, and I felt confident that I had the deal working.
 Now I would need to go home and hope my wife‚Äôs level of understanding would allow me to be completely honest with her about what I was doing, and what I had just done.
 I knew Lisa wanted to help Brandon and we both knew my involvement would require a venture into unchartered territory but I needed her to know everything.

In the present context, employment is the most effective way to distribute the fruits of development among people.
 The world is now capable of producing sufficient food and other basic necessities to feed, clothe and house everyone; but without opportunities for employment, people lack the purchasing power needed to buy them.
 Economic entitlement, rather than a shortage of food or food production capacity, is the key to global food security.
 Lack of employment opportunities is also directly linked to destruction of the environment, both rural and urban.
 The destruction of tropical rain forests has been one result.
 The greatest security challenges of the twenty-first century are economic, not military or political.
 Employment is a sine qua non for meeting these challenges.
 A thorough examination of facts and a dispassionate analysis reveal grounds for hope and opportunities for action.
 The possibility of more rapid economic growth and rising incomes in both developed and developing countries ‚Äì spurred by further substantial reduction in defence spending, the diffusion and application of new technologies, economic liberalization leading to growth of international trade, the globalization of financial markets, and the emergence of new engines for global expansion among developing countries ‚Äì indicates that our apprehensions need not prove justified, provided society acts courageously and decisively to meet the challenge.
 A global overview of employment cannot do full justice to the special circumstances, problems and potentials of specific regions and countries, but it can dispel the growing concern that employment has become a problem beyond the means of governments or the global economy to eradicate or even contain.

It came back to me then.
 I dropped into a chair, my head falling into my hands to cover my face.
 Ruby started to say something, but Chevelle cut her off.
 ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt you offer your guest breakfast?‚Äù She sniffed.
 ‚ÄúLunch maybe.‚Äù A plate of food landed on the table in front of me with a slap.
 ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I managed.
 I was hungry, despite the embarrassment.
 I grabbed the plate and started eating.

My near attack ended the conversation, albeit with my old clothes still packed away in some anonymous box.
 Mom's enthusiasm couldn't be damped for long though.
 It had fully returned by the time she turned my light off.
 "Have a good night, Adri...ana.
 You'll see, tomorrow will be like the start of a whole new life."
 I kept the tears back until the door was shut, and then they came in a hot rush that left me depleted and sore.
 It was like Mom had already forgotten about the other half of our family.

From Rodregas‚Äô perspective the next two seemed to withstand the pain a lot better than then he had.
 After all three were completed Imeralda used her magic to inscribe Jordaan.
 The healing sigil was the only sigil commonly used by magic users.
 A few were known to use sigils that improved memory or allowed one to store excess magic.
 After the sensation faded Rodregas felt no different than before.
 Rodregas had the feeling that Jordaan would have liked to keep the little frog; it was a powerful tool in the hands of an Elemental Healer like Jordaan, but Rodregas was not willing to give it up, and Jordaan never actually asked.
 The next morning they headed out for the Cathedral of Oravue.

 Chevelle mumbled something and my ears began to ring, distracting me from bewilderment.
 It was only a few stuttered heartbeats before recognition came.

 ‚ÄúStop,‚Äù I repeated.

I like to laugh, hear jokes and funny songs, whack golf balls back and forth across a fairway, cheer for teams and bring pleasant news wherever I can.
 But I don't understand how we can fail to get serious when people are burning, starving, weeping and hopelessly perishing, and while deep down we know we're not all we could be, or doing all we could do.
 In that, I'm like Sylvia Curtis.
 Eternity
 Philosopher and theologian Dallas Willard proposes that people who are right with God won't readily notice when they die, because they will already reside in the kingdom of heaven.
 Though I can't second his proposal with assurance, I see evidence for it, as I believe I have spent time in the kingdom of heaven.
 And if we can go there in this life, the difference might be as slight as crossing the state line into Oregon.
 On my own, I won't propose anything about the after-life.
 Observing and attempting to grasp this life is enough of a challenge.
 But God will make justice come about somewhere, somehow.

 Still, because Eric didn‚Äôt create himself, to worship him would be like praising Hamlet rather than Shakespeare.

This superabundance conceals gaping holes of ignorance.
 American foreign policy toward the USSR in the 1980s was certainly influenced by the fact that, as recently as 1988, more than 50 per cent of Americans believed the Soviets fought against the United States in the Second World War.
 The irrational alarm which economists sounded in the late 1970s about the impact of inflation on the poor in the US overshad owed compelling evidence published by a leading economic institution that poorer Americans were actually better off and it was primarily the rich who were less advantaged by the price rise.
 The importance of continuous investment in training is not fully understood by all but the most advanced corporations.
 There is considerable scope for increasing awareness in areas such as self-employment opportunities, the linkage between education and career development, management practices, and foreign trade opportunities.
 Ignorance and superstition concerning drugs, crime, ethnic and race relations, the environment, health, education, child care, and the life of the elderly demoralize the population and make effective socialaction difficult in these areas.
 These problems can be minimized by educating the public to understand the changes taking place and to adopt appropriate new behaviours.
 Raising awareness internationally
 Public opinion is an even more important determinant at the international level, since the authority of global institutions is still quite limited.
 Rising ethnic and nationalistic sentiments threaten the integrity of states and impede progress toward regional cooperation and global governance in many countries, because their populations lack reliable information regarding the enormous costs of political and economic fragmentation.

I looked down at my Spanish test and wondered how I'd gotten here.
 There were answers on the page.
 They were unmistakably done in my awkward scrawl, but didn't make sense.
 I flipped the page over and found more of the same.
 My eyes idly traced down the page, finding blanks and almost of its own accord my pencil reached out and filled them in with words that seemed familiar, but whose meaning I couldn't seem to pin down.
 I resurfaced as I walked into the tutor lab, unsure if I'd passed anyone I should have greeted.
 I sat down at my usual spot and pulled out a book at random as Britney stomped into the room and threw her books down.
 She was obviously mad, but once again I couldn't muster enough concern to figure out what'd ticked her off.

 She was important, one of the few teachers that actually liked me.

More than two hundred moving forms halted after that one pass, but a thousand more swayed in their sick, distracting dance.

 Blood ruptured from the beautiful creature‚Äôs neck.

 They crashed into the inky blackness, crushing bodies underneath before the swarming dead tore them to pieces.
 Velixar‚Äôs first attack was far more impressive.
 Bits of bone ripped out from his undead army; femurs, fingers, ribs, and teeth flew into the sky in a deadly assault.

I decided to show him.
 I stepped forward, noting his unease at my movement, and faced the boar that lay on the ground behind him.

 I was afraid to scare him too much, so I decided on a small gesture.
 I held my hand out in front of me, emphasizing the action as I twisted my wrist in the air, the boar‚Äôs head spinning, the sound of its neck cracking in tandem with my movement.
 He gasped and stepped back from me.
 I was afraid for a moment I‚Äôd shown him too much.
 He looked at my face, searching, and finally let out a breathless, ‚ÄúMagic.‚Äù His face was filled with wonder.

 Massive rock formations loomed over us, loose stones underfoot causing the horses to stumble.
 The haze was so thick I couldn‚Äôt see anything but the riders in front of me.
 I only knew from the strain on my legs we were heading up, climbing higher into the gray sky and biting wind.
 Chevelle rode beside me through the day.
 When we stopped for the evening, he pulled me down from my horse and stayed near as we sat on large stones around a fire.
 Ruby was telling stories again and everyone gave her their full attention‚Ä¶ everyone but us.
 ‚ÄúHow do you feel?‚Äù he asked.
 I shrugged.

 CHAPTER FIFTEEN
 "Luuuucy!
 You not goin' to play in the band tonight."
 Rick watched without seeing and listened without hearing as Ricky and Lucy fought.
 It had been Marie's favorite show.
 She'd been gone four days.
 He'd sat in the garden until nearly 9:00 Tuesday evening.
 He'd slept hardly at all that night, but he dragged himself to work anyway, not wanting to spend all day alone in the house.

My getting closer to you is the ultimate form of self-gratification.
 It's the worst possible thing I could do to you.
 If you somehow survive everything that's about to happen, it would leave you forever hungering for another touch, but never able to fulfill that desire."
 I placed a hand on his lips before he could ramp back up to another diatribe.
 "None of that matters.
 All I want is to be with you, and if we're as likely to all die as you seem to think we are, then the state of my mind after you're gone is hardly something worth wasting worry on.
 I accept your invitation.
 As much as I hate the very thought of going to any formal dance, I can think of nothing better than going with you."
 "That's the addiction, the Ja'tell bond talking."
 Now that I knew his concerns, it was hard not to notice just how distracting the feel of his lips under my fingers was.

She hadn't ever managed to really pique my interest in any boy, but I could see how a few years from now, he'd probably be fairly popular among college girls.
 Britney stopped before one of the top lockers and started spinning the tumbler.
 She was still relating some story about her old school, but suddenly I couldn't hear a word.
 The crowd of students had drifted to the sides of the hall, like worshipers making way for a pair of pagan gods.
 Even so, there still wasn't quite room for them to walk side by side.
 The girl was leading.
 Her dark, wavy hair and flawless skin would've made her pretty in any crowd, but she also had perfectly symmetrical features and one of those bodies that required hours each day in the gym to maintain.
 I wanted to hate her.
 It didn't make any sense, she could hardly be blamed for taking care of herself, but it just didn't seem fair.
 Simply by being in the same town as us, she automatically made every other girl in school feel like bloated, heifers.

My wife, Lisa sat on the bathroom floor with him during his lowest moments.
 He vomited until he had nothing left.
 He curled up in the fetal position, chanting inaudible ramblings and contorting to the point that we had to pad the doorframe and cabinets with towels to keep him from banging his head and limbs.
 In the twelfth hour of fetal position rocking, infantile whimpering, sickening dry heaves and panicked breathing, I broke out my video camera, thinking I‚Äôd just tape a reminder: He can‚Äôt possibly ever want to do this again.
 His mother on the bathroom floor alongside him, cushioning his head before it smacks the doorframe, stroking his back and newly shorn hair.
 I am defined again by this moment, disgusted by myself, but in a warped way triumphant: You see, you see you little shit‚Äî what happens when you don‚Äôt listen to me?
 He was a walking skeleton and you could see his every rib.
 The bones on his spine looked like a row of knots stretched under his skin.
 His pelvic bones stuck out reminiscent of a dead animal‚Äôs carcass on the roadside.
 He looked like one of the horrid pictures you see of a concentration camp victim.

Moonlight glinted off Ruby‚Äôs figure in the distance, heading away from the village.
 I didn‚Äôt think.
 I just pulled a cloak from the pile on her bed and was out the hidden door behind the wardrobe.
 I ran in a crouch, praying no one spotted me as I gained on her.
 I only once glanced at the house in the fear I wouldn‚Äôt be able to find my way back.
 If I wanted to catch Ruby, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to mark my path.
 Her cloaked form leapt over a tall rock and disappeared.
 I hurried forward, sure I was about to lose both her and the route.
 When I topped the rock, I froze, taking a heartbeat too long to drop to my stomach.
 Just over that ridge stood a group of elves, though after my pulse settled, I didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd seen me before I‚Äôd fallen back.

 I took his hand and he pulled me up.
 ‚ÄúYup, I‚Äôm just peachy.‚Äù ‚ÄúAt least you can use sarcasm in a time like this,‚Äù he said and started to fight his way through the crowd.
 I followed him quickly.
 I had no desire to become separated again.
 ‚ÄúWhen can‚Äôt you use sarcasm?‚Äù I asked loudly.
 He didn‚Äôt reply to me because he had spotted Emily.

 He stood up, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not hiding anything.‚Äù His voice was level but it shook slightly.
 I stepped towards him and gave him a hard shove.
 He stumbled back and fell on the ground.
 He looked up at me, waiting for what I would do next.
 ‚ÄúWhy are you keeping a secret from me?‚Äù I repeated, my voice as cold as an icicle.

Even so, I don't really know what it's like to be a shape shifter.
 Most of the time it just means they're faster and stronger than me.

 I felt my heart speed up as Rachel met my eyes with more gravity even than normal.
 "They aren't always completely in control, Adri.
 They try, and some of them are really good.
 Alec is probably the most controlled person I've ever met, and Isaac is so disciplined he's almost immune to the power plays.
 Even so, sometimes it's like they operate on a shorter fuse than the rest of us."
 My throat was so dry it took me two attempts to clear it.

 For whatever reason you just aren‚Äôt connecting.

 I was a little dense‚Äîthis was, oh, I don‚Äôt know, before Lorelei, before we really hit big.
 And, then afterwards, one of those driving home epiphanies, I figured out who she was, and that she was looking at me because she recognized me and expected me to recognize her.
 So, I was a bit embarrassed and when I got home, I called her.
 I said, hey, it‚Äôs Buddy.
 I know, she said.
 I said, well, shit, you know, in the restaurant, I‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt remember who you were, and I thought, damn, this is embarrassing, but, I thought you were staring at me, you know, to get my attention, to get my heterosexual attention.
 And, well, then I remembered, of course, that I knew you through the Tickles.

‚ÄúI was his slave.

I lit a thin flame to practice fire magic, leaning forward as I danced it back and forth above the ground.
 My control had progressed a good deal since my training had begun; it seemed almost easy to navigate a small flame.
 I smoothed it out into a line and traced arcs and then more intricate designs.
 The designs started to resemble portraits and I had to concentrate hard to keep from seeing them, so I focused on landscapes, but those grew from tiny village houses and trees to rolling hills and curving creeks.
 Before long, the hills rose to mountains that melted into unidentifiable monsters.
 I snuffed the flame with a wave and the den was black with night.
 Eventually, the clouds broke and the soft glow of moonlight filtered in through the opening.
 I leaned onto an elbow to examine the glistening patches of light on the skin of my outstretched hand, twisting it from day to night, pale to dark.
 Weary and trancelike, I lowered my head, tucking my arm back as a pillow, and fell into a deep sleep.

 Mom's chuckle was almost genuine.
 If Alec hadn't implied she was going to suspect I'd been up to no good, I probably wouldn't have even noticed how off she sounded.
 "You're right, dear.
 I shouldn't have doubted you.
 I just had a few kids come hiking past this morning talking about this massive party the entire school was at last night.
 I know it's completely irrational, but I kept thinking about you there with all that alcohol."
 I was so nervous about answering her question that I didn't realize she was headed over to shut my window until she was already so close that there was no hope of intercepting her.
 Hopefully Alec had kept moving after he'd jumped.

Her message always expresses or implies that by serving the poorest of the poor, the MCs minister to Christ in his distressing disguise.
 This morning she quoted, ‚ÄúFor I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me."
 She only spoke a few minutes, yet three times she asked that we pray for the MCs and the poorest of the poor.
 I joined the receiving line.
 As those of us standing went first, it only took a few minutes, during which I received the clarity to recognize that God, the source of all power, only works through people who stand aside and let him.
 Mother Teresa has built a mighty force of little, brown, meek, powerful women, because she knows and practices the art of humility, as perfectly as anyone I've witnessed.
 Her ego vanishes.
 God fills the vacuum.
 One of her warm hands touched mine and the other pressed my forehead.
 She smiled as poignantly as though I were her son, and her greatness revealed itself instantly.

Rodregas had thought that Jorin would also be set free.
 Two months went by and Rodregas had developed a strong fondness for the boy; a few of the guards made jokes that Rodregas had a new pet.
 Rodregas was used to the rough humor of soldiers and let such jokes roll off.
 The night came when the father was taken for the ceremony.
 Rodregas was on guard duty when Korin came down in his new body.
 The poor lad had stared at the man who had been his father, saying nothing, but tears ran down his cheeks.
 The apprentice Immortalist had then proceeded to rape the mother.
 The Adapt was rough and the act was violent and Korin, in his new body, clearly enjoyed the violence more than the sex.
 After he had finished with the mother, he had the guards release the boy who had run over to his sobbing bleeding mother.
 In a fatherly gesture Korin had kissed the boy on the cheek and, wrapping his hands around the boy‚Äôs head in a slow loving gesture, made a quick yank and broke Join‚Äôs neck.

 Rachel's promise somehow seemed like it belonged from another time.
 The sincerity pulled me further out of my safe, numb shelter.
 Something in me wanted to confide in her, was willing to risk the pain of facing reality, but I was too far gone to be able to put what I was feeling into words.
 I shook my head again, not sure if it was a refusal or something else entirely.
 Rachel took it as the former and sat down next to me, pulling her knees up tight against her chest.
 A few seconds later I heard the howl of an after-market exhaust fed by a turbo-charged engine.
 The green Honda that came screaming through the parking lot was hardly recognizable as an Accord.
 It was approaching too quickly, but I couldn't bring myself to care.

We began our work with the conviction that, as Willy Brandt said, 'the problems created by men can be solved by men'.
 The ancient Indian scripture, Bhagavad Gita, expressed the same sentiment by stressing, 'Whatever man aspires to, that he can accomplish.'
 The achievement of food self-sufficiency by India in a period when famine threatened millions of lives through the power of political will and scientific action in a democratic society illustrates this truth.
 In spite of such uncommon opportunities for a better common present, during the last six years the world has been witness to an escalation of ethnic and mini-conflicts, growing intolerance of diversity, the spread of small arms, an increase in violence starting with violence to oneself through drug addiction and damage to the life support systems of land, water, flora, fauna and the atmosphere.
 In addition, the current pattern of economic and technological growth is leading to gross social inequity and rising joblessness.
 The rich-poor divide is widening both within and among nations.
 At the same time, the spread of knowledge and information, particularly through the electronic media, has led to an era of rising expectations.
 The economically and socially underprivileged sections of human society are now aware that their future is not a question of fate, but of political and technological choice.
 If they are not given access to the information superhighways and other technological highways to progress, a new form of social and economic apartheid will spread, which will be even more serious in its consequences to the future of human civilization than the skin-colour-based apartheid which has just ended.
 True education is leadership in thought.

"I don't want you to go into the garden mad."
 She smiled then.
 "I'm not mad."
 "Good."
 He drew her into his arms, bending to kiss her.
 Her mouth tasted so good, felt so warm and soft.
 He'd give anything to keep her here with him, to marry her and make love to her and spend the rest of his life with her.
 Remembering that she‚Äôd said she liked being kissed on the neck, he moved to press his lips to her neck, kissing, nibbling, sucking.
 Marie gasped, threading her fingers into his hair.
 His hands slid down her back, pulling her hard against him, reminding her of how he'd pinned her against his car last night.

The Order was unique in that it trained not just in the various martial arts but also in the magical, and recruited those who had magical power, but lacked the temperament or intelligence to be a sorcerer.
 Instead of working toward the power of sorcery, they underwent the Sigil ceremony, gaining a magical enhancement but losing the versatility of a true mage.
 Gaining such sigils was outlawed by the guide except for their own warriors, but the Order of the Soaring Heavens was also the traditional sources for the Gods own Paladins, and even the Celestial Guild had never dared to anger the gods by interfering with their use of sigils.
 Rigoria had been one of the greatest of the Order of the Soaring Heavens, but he had grown old and his health had failed him.
 When tempted by the Immortalists with a new body, he had accepted.
 Even though such action was anathema to the very teachings of the Order, he had become an officer of the Immortal Guards, and eventually their leader.
 Several of the most powerful Knights had over the centuries, formed the officer core of The Immortal Guards.
 These Knights traded their honor for near immortality in the Guards.
 The Immortal Guards were all sigil warriors with one or several magical enhancements.
 They also had the best resources of the entire Eastern Realm, the most powerful enchanted armor, the best weapons; their officers rode Dire Beasts for steeds.

 I ran my finger along his cheek, mirroring the motion he'd done to me so many times.
 "Then don't ask them.
 You'll either win, in which case it doesn't matter whether I'm there or not, or else I don't care what happens."
 Both fists were knotted now, and unless I was very much mistaken, there was just the barest hint of a shake there as well.
 "Don't be ridiculous, Adri.

At the end of the Second World War the victorious nations joined together to found the UN.
 At the end of the Cold War, the organization needs to be re-founded, and restructured according to democratic principles, to give a more active role and more equitable representation to people of all nations.
 To deem such considerations unrealistic given the present alignment of power in the world is a short-sighted view.
 It ignores the incredible speed and scope of changes that have radically transformed international relations over the past half decade.
 It assumes that the present system has the backing of the international community and that it can and will sustain itself regardless of whatever steps we may contemplate.
 A fundamental change in structure is essential and inevitable.
 The break-up of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War have resulted in the demise of the bipolar system which dominated international relations after 1945.
 The United States is now recognized as the sole superpower and the primary determinant of actions by the UN Security Council.
 But neither America‚Äôs culture nor its historical economic and political development and present outlook will permit it to take on the extraordinary responsibilities and overseas commitments which fulfilment of this role necessitates, as its reluctance to get involved in Bosnia and Rwanda, and its quick withdrawal from Somalia illustrate.
 Indeed, no one nation can or should assume such responsibilities on behalf of the whole world.

 Eventually, my father did seek to find out who the father was.

 I was almost happy it would not be powerful, half human and unmagical.
 I wondered if it could even be brought to term, I was ill so often now.
 The elders discussed it constantly‚Äîit was so unusual to be sick, but it must have been a result of the pregnancy.
 Several of them were assigned to watch me and I had to listen to their incessant chatter.

Asking Captain Poir to send up Adapt Korin had been totally unplanned.
 He had been dreaming of killing Korin for all the 18 years that he had served in the tower.
 The Sorcerer Ravenhurr had been an immoral monster that used those around him for his own selfish desires.
 But Adapt Korin was of a more casual evil; he never passed up the opportunity to hurt those around him, physically or emotionally.
 Ravenhurr had existed in the same body for the full eighteen years of Rodregas‚Äô service, and was hundreds of years old.
 In all his years serving in the tower Ravenhurr had only tried to hold the ceremony three times, each time abandoning the attempt due to the lack of a celestial animal.
 A celestial animal was extremely rare, but required as part of the ceremony for Ravenhurr‚Äôs next step up in power.
 In contrast, his assistant, the Adapt Korin, had been going though bodies constantly.
 Worse, he seemed to take great delight in letting people know what fate awaited them.
 Rape and torture of the victims were common occurrences with Korin.

Existing weapons would be destroyed or turned over to the peace force.
 As in NATO, members would agree by treaty to consider an attack on one member as an attack on all.
 The peace force would intervene automatically and unconditionally ‚Äì defensively and, if necessary, offensively ‚Äì to protect the sovereignty and international borders of any member country, provided that it conformed to the rules under the charter.
 The organization could also assist members in fighting drug trafficking and terrorist activities.
 The benefits of this cooperative peace-keeping mechanism would be manifold:
 Since the charter would bind members and the alliance to eschew the use of force and aggression for any reason, it would represent a stabilizing, non-provocative, non-offensive defence.
 Its charter could also include specific provisions for close association with other international forces.
 Its combined strength and technological capabilities would exceed those of any of its members and constitute a substantial deterrent to aggression against any member country.
 It would significantly reduce the costs of security for members, possibly by up to 50 or 75 per cent, without compromising their legitimate security needs.
 The more members, the lower the defence expenditure required by each, both because the collective force would be larger and because the number of potential adversaries would be reduced proportionately.

Eradication of terrorism is possible, but it demands a comprehensive and integrated approach and concerted, collective action.
 The commercialization of the arms trade ‚Äì which benefits some countries economically at the expense of the security of all nations ‚Äì must be subject to rigorous monitoring and control by international agencies.
 Vested economic interests that thrive on conflict must be placed under UN surveillance and regulation.
 International institutions must be strengthened to eradicate arms smuggling, narcotics, offshore money laundering and other criminal activities that serve as seedbeds and instruments for terrorism.
 However, no final solution to the problem of terrorism can be arrived at by force alone.
 While terrorism is frequently attributed to religion and ideology, it sprouts and thrives most readily among populations that lack opportunities for gainful employment and economic development.
 Social unrest is an expression of the upward aspiration of those who have been left out of the political and development process or who feel threatened by the rapid pace and stress of social change and inequity.
 Those who lack the opportunity or the ability to labour intensely for their own upliftment express their productive energies through the intensity of violence.
 The international community cannot afford to be silent spectators of the growing violence.
 Peace, democracy and development are inseparable and interdependent.

Firms that adopt new technologies report even more serious problems.
 In addition, the work force in many developing countries also lacks advanced productive skills for agriculture and a broad range of other basic vocations.
 The proportion of the labour force in the 20-24 age category that have undergone formal vocational training ranges from a low of 5 per cent in countries such as India and 28 per cent in Mexico to as high as 96 per cent in Korea.
 Vocational training systems need to be substantially strengthened to close the gap, including training for farmers, skilled crafts, self-employment and entrepreneurship.
 Advances in multimedia technology now makes it possible to utilize computers, internet and even television broadcasts to deliver a wide range of educational information and vocational skills that otherwise would be unavailable or very costly to disseminate.
 Upgrading the quality of education and enhancing the skills of the work force will accelerate job creation the world over.
 Distance education provides new opportunities for achieving the goal of education for all within a span of a few years.
 The Challenge and the Opportunity
 The problem of unemployment is of relatively recent origin.
 The very idea of employment as opposed to livelihood is a recent conception born of the Industrial Revolution.

 On the phone is lead undercover narcotics officer Denny White.
 Officer White wants to do a last minute sound check on the wire that I am wearing taped to my back.

 It didn't tell the date of her death.
 That was odd--he was sure it had been in this section.
 His heart began racing as he scanned those pages.
 There was no mention at all of her death--or of her marriage.
 The only information was her date of birth, the names of her parents and brother, and the general family history.
 He knew that the other information had been there before, and after his mind had completely rejected the impossible--that the print had changed when Marie had stepped from 1927 into 2011 (another impossibility)--he rapidly considered the implications of such an impossibility.
 Maybe the information about the rest of her life wouldn't appear until she returned.

 One of her warm hands touched mine and the other pressed my forehead.
 She smiled as poignantly as though I were her son, and her greatness revealed itself instantly.
 Because I realized that although she earned a Nobel prize and is frequently called a living Saint, she considers herself no better than me.
 Talk about humility.
 The Commandment
 A song reminds me of 1 John 3:23, ‚ÄúThis is his commandment, to believe in the name of his son, Jesus, and to love one another as he commanded us.‚Äù Again I think about the power of a single word to change us, and redirect our lives, and perhaps give us the ability to change others and the world.
 But I suspect it‚Äôs not likely to do so unless we stop and wrestle with its meanings.
 In an essay on writing short stories, Andre Dubus advised that when we get stuck, instead of stopping or attempting to go forward, we should try going deeper.
 On this trip, I have attempted to deepen my understanding of the word ‚Äúadore.‚Äù Now I‚Äôm trying to do the same with some words in John‚Äôs admonition, because I feel my mind or the Spirit telling me that everything we need to know to live in goodness and beauty may be contained in those few lines.

 The elf who had been sitting with me was now in a fiercely protective stance in front of me.
 I leaned around him to see, placing my hand on his leg as I angled my head past it.
 That broke his stare and he glanced down at me.
 I watched Chevelle, still walking casually toward us, as if there weren‚Äôt two angry panthers preparing to pounce on him.

At any rate he was gone before our move south).

 I remember comparing peepees with the girl down the street;  I even remember her name (well, of course I do, my first sex) which was Sandy.
 I remember, as if from a bad dream, a life lesson dream) getting a hellacious shock from our electric football game.
 This was a flat metal gameboard which you plugged into the wall and it vibrated and your defensive and offensive formations danced together (or apart) in random, chaotic tremblings, until the player with the ball (a small plastic chip) was shaken off the playing field.
 I think I piled rubber bricks on the game (although rubber shouldn't give you a shock, should it?)
 and was jolted into an acute awareness, which obviously left its impression.

A little eddy of wind found its way into our grotto, and for the first time my newly-acute sense of smell registered Alec's presence.
 His scent was divine, full of subtle themes I wasn't experienced enough to pick out, all of which screamed of warm power and rock-like masculinity.
 For half a second the torrent of sensation was too strong to leave room for conscious thought.
 I realized I'd closed my eyes to better savor the experience.
 When I opened them Alec's expression had moved from annoyance to sadness.
 I had a pair of heartbeats to wonder at the strange tricks my subconscious was playing on me, and then the dream started fading away.
 The heavenly surroundings were predictably the first thing to disappear, leaving afterimages of light burned into the corners of my vision.
 Alec was the next thing to go, but the memory of his features clung to my mind long after I found myself in a featureless void.
 Stranger still, his scent stayed with me even longer.
 I was just self-aware enough to hope I'd remember it all when I awoke in the morning.

 Except for Chevelle.
 He was watching me as I glared back at him.
 Why had I expected more from him?
 He was my watcher.
 He‚Äôd volunteered to help council bind me.
 But it didn‚Äôt stop the hostile stare I was sending his way.

Brandon left our home with little in his hands and got into what was once a nice little car, but was now something appropriate for a salvage yard with body damage, a driver‚Äôs door that wouldn‚Äôt open, and water leaking through missing door seals.
 Brandon had to get in from the passenger side of this wreck of a car, symbolic of his wreck of a life.
 My wife and I held each other as we watched him back out of the driveway.
 He couldn‚Äôt even look at us as he drove away to God knows where.
 We were numb.
 Our son was 6‚Äô2‚Äù about 135 pounds and addicted to one of the most powerful drugs on the street: Oxycontin.
 What would happen to him?
 Would he get busted again, overdose or die in a drug deal gone bad?
 We contemplated the worst as we watched what was our son, our first-born, drive off into complete uncertainty.
 We didn‚Äôt know Brandon at all, and we really believed we might never see him again.

His eyes seemed of no use so he closed them and simply walked toward where he knew she was.
 He felt Doi‚Äôvan grab onto his shoulder and follow him.
 When he opened his eyes, he saw that they had entered another great chamber.
 At first he thought it was the same size as the first chamber until his eyes saw the huge tree in the middle and followed it up and then up.
 The tree soared above them so high that Rodregas thought it must be far higher than the Cathedral itself.
 This was, of course, impossible.
 As Rodregas stopped beside Imeralda he tried to see the shape of the leaf to identify the type of tree, but the leaves were so high up he could only see a very general shape.
 The shape of the trunk reminded him of a white oak, but the color was a darker gray with touches of striped brown.
 The trunk was huge, thicker than the towers of the keep.
 But that made no sense to Rodregas.

If this was true, and he was clean, maybe he‚Äôd be a good person to go to for help?
 My mother thought so, and she insisted that we reach out to him.
 We were obviously reluctant and for good reason, but we were also desperate.
 My mother insisted that Thomas‚Äôs last rehab stint at Narconon had worked for Thomas and she knew he had strong ties there and perhaps he could get Brandon in for treatment.
 She told us that Thomas was doing work for the rehab in the form of interventions and getting drug addicts into treatment and that was what Brandon needed.
 But at what price?
 I wasn‚Äôt as worried about the financial price at this point, but rather the thought of owing Thomas after all that he had perpetrated against us was almost as unpalatable as Brandon‚Äôs Oxy addiction.
 This was all unchartered territory.
 It was all uncomfortable.
 It all sucked big time.

Seth narrowed his eyes.
 ‚ÄúNo, I'd be cold, wet and annoyed.
 You can do that if you feel like having me be grouchy all day.‚Äù ‚ÄúNah,‚Äù Emily said.
 ‚ÄúI don't think it would be worth it.‚Äù ‚ÄúAre we just going to sit here and talk or are we going to get a move on?‚Äù I asked.
 ‚ÄúAlright then,‚Äù Emily said and walked out of the cave.
 ‚ÄúIf you want to go in the dreary woods so bad, we'll go.‚Äù Jason walked after her, shoulders hunched.
 I went to follow him when Seth said, ‚ÄúWe should tell them about our dreams.‚Äù I turned around and faced him.
 ‚ÄúWe should, they need to know in case they have ones like ours.‚Äù Seth nodded and followed me as we joined everyone else outside.
 Emily waited for us and then headed into the woods.
 She waved to the dragon and we disappeared once more.

Release any remaining prisoners and make sure they are fed and clothed, and allow them to make their way back to their homes.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat has some danger to it,‚Äù said Captain Poir hurriedly, his expression returning to a look of concern.
 ‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù he replied.
 ‚ÄúBut do as I command,‚Äù Rodregas stated in his firmest voice.
 Captain Poir nodded and immediately said, ‚ÄúAs you command, master.‚Äù Rodregas started to open the door to the stairway when another thought hit him, and he turned back to the captain, and said, ‚ÄúI need time to adjust.
 Make sure that I am not disturbed in my quarters tonight, but tell Adapt Korin that before he leaves to celebrate, to come up to my room for some last minute instructions.‚Äù Captain Poir responded with his very military, ‚ÄúYes sir.‚Äù  Rodregas had to admit while most of the guards were no better trained than a ruffian off the street the captain had served with The Immortal Guards and he was highly trained and disciplined.
 Rodregas had always wondered what had brought a man of his obvious military background to serve Ravenhurr; thank goodness he clearly did not understand the simplest things about magic.
 On the other hand, the AElf maiden clearly had some ideas.
 He was glad she was gagged and not able to speak, and the guards knew better than to release a mage from her bindings until they had to.
 As Rodregas made his way down to the next level, the personal level of Master Ravenhurr, he closed the door to his suite of rooms that covered the whole floor.
 He listened as the other guards made their way down the tower.

Her voice had a casual quality, but Rodregas sensed she thought this very important.
 ‚ÄúWhen Doi‚Äôvan sees you, he thinks of you as one of the blood, a noble in fact, if not by birth.
 Most of the men and women in this circle are that; faster, stronger because they descend from a Celestial god.
 But you are not that.
 The Celestial Beasts all represent something.‚Äù She paused, looking at him for the first time.
 ‚ÄúWhat does The Lion represent, Rodregas?‚Äù she asked.
 Rodregas was silent for a moment and then said, ‚ÄúStrength, the Hunter, and Protector of the Pride.‚Äù He spoke words that he knew he had learned as a child at temple.
 Imeralda nodded, a smile starting to appear on her face.
 ‚ÄúAnd what would happen if this group of squires tried to take on a Celestial Lion?‚Äù she asked.
 Rodregas started to laugh at the idea and then stopped cold.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre coming in.‚Äù Chevelle leaned back, his fingers brushing my collarbone when he pulled away.
 I bit my lip at the tingle that ran through me, and the corner of his mouth turned up into a different kind of smile.
 He stood to walk from the room and I stared at the stone entry, struggling to keep my thoughts from spinning out of control.
 Too much had happened.
 Too much was wrong.
 My life had flipped, twisted into some strange reflection of itself, and I couldn‚Äôt reconcile the fragments.
 It caused me physical pain to think about Chevelle‚Äôs touch, about council, about what was happening, and I knew it was the bonds.
 When Grey walked out, my trance broke and I noticed Ruby by the front window, wearing an odd smile.
 I flushed and turned from her, rolling into a ball on my blankets, remembering no more than the feel of his skin on my neck, the quirk of his lips.
 I had to keep distracted, and there was nothing for it but the book.

This red-dream self looked straight at him and spoke, but Harruq could not understand the words.
 The sound of his own voice chilled him, though, for it was dark, it was dangerous, and it was exactly like Velixar‚Äôs.

 It was darker than any shade that haunted his nightmares.
 There was only one it could be, and it was no mortal.

 Even I could tell that I wasn't doing a very good job pretending I believed him.

 "It's okay that you don't believe me yet, I'm equal to the challenge of convincing you."
 He smiled at my shrug, but now that we weren't arguing about the inevitable fact he was eventually going to leave me, my mind was free to start working again.
 "Don't do what?"
 For the first time ever, I'd managed to catch him by surprise.
 It took him several seconds to figure out what I was talking about.
 "Your hands, you tend to talk with them when you're excited or angry, and it's very distracting.

Mrs. Campbell wasn't as pale as she'd been when she'd left, but she still looked unsettled and more than a little unhappy, presumably with both whatever had caused her to leave so quickly, and the fact that she'd come back to a class where almost nobody had been doing anything productive.
 I had a couple of heartbeats to hope she'd realized I'd been trying to help Britney with her homework, and therefore not deserving of any punishment.
 "Britney, Adriana, I'll need to speak with you both after the bell."
 Apparently the whole justice thing was on the fritz right now.
 It would probably start working again just in time to punish me for whatever bad thing I did next.
 I tried to work on my homework some more, but my heart wasn't in it, so I just sat at my desk and tried not to look like I was pouting.
 All too soon class was over, and I found myself trailing Britney up to Mrs. Campbell's desk.
 She still didn't look very happy, but there was a trace more self-control to her face than a few minutes before.
 "Britney, despite spending at least an hour at the tutor lab each afternoon, the quality of your homework hasn't come up in the slightest, so I took the liberty of talking to your father yesterday."
 Britney's gasp had all the dramatic effect you'd expect out of someone who'd spent the last decade of her life getting away with pretty much whatever she wanted.

Everything, all fighting, all arguing, all bleeding, living and dying halted at that moment.
 For Harruq, there was only the sight of Aurelia doubled over, her eyes filled with sadness.
 His arm yanked the blade out of her, without any thought on his part.
 ‚ÄúHarruq?‚Äù she gasped.
 She fell on her back, still clutching her bleeding abdomen.
 That look of sadness tore through his rage.
 What should have been the exhilaration of the kill was instead the cold, biting emotion of guilt.
 His eyes lingered on the blood on his blade before something changed inside.
 He looked back to the elf, and again the words of his brother echoed in his head.
 Do you love her?

He swung for her face, turning the blade at the last moment so the flat side struck her.

 Aurelia laughed.

 Harruq looked at his weapons and then shrugged.

She did have incredibly soft-looking wavy brown hair though.
 It looked like debate boy had pretty much finished answering her question.
 I looked back down at my book so I wouldn't get caught staring.
 I was just about to dive back into my text book when someone cleared their throat nearby.
 The tutor was standing at my elbow looking over my assignment.
 "Hi, I'm Albert, and you must be Adri."
 I winced again.
 It was going to take a lot of work to get people to use my full name.

He tried not to think of what she‚Äôd say if she knew what he had done.

The United States spends three times as much on welfare payments as it does on retraining the unemployed.
 For three decades, Sweden achieved the highest employment rate among OECD countries based on 'the passionate belief in full employment' and 'the right to work' and on active policies to generate work for all, rather than payments to the unemployed.
 Drawing lessons from the Swedish model, introduce a comprehensive programme of education and vocational preparedness for the unemployed, compulsory retraining for those who are unemployed for more than six months, and a strictly managed penalty system for unemployed persons who refuse successive job offers and do not seek retraining.
 7.Improve labour market information and job placement systems: Labour markets are becoming more and more fluid.
 One in ten jobs is now replaced in OECD countries every year.
 This makes the strengthening of job placement systems a crucial element in any full employment strategy.
 Lack of access to information about job or training opportunities retards re-employment.
 Sweden operates one of the most extensive and efficient employment services, in close cooperation with business, that is responsible for filling 60 per cent of total job vacancies.
 Improve labour market information systems within and between countries by increasing the accuracy and comparability of data, requiring mandatory reporting by businesses of all sizes, and freely exchanging information between cities, states and countries on successful employment-generating strategies.
 8.Raise minimum standards for education: Higher education increases productivity, raises personal expectations and consumption, and generates additional jobs in education and elsewhere.

As winter approached, we sat by the fireplace and took turns reading out loud.
 We admired Russell‚Äôs smug attitude, the gall of a fellow who accused Christ of utter arrogance for counting people vipers simply because they disapproved of his preaching.
 We delighted in Russell's arguments that Christianity was the principal enemy of moral progress in the world.
 Dismiss Christ, trust ourselves, we would discover the solution.
 Simple.
 After a couple of Russell‚Äôs books, Eric brought home Thus Spoke Zarathustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche, a strangely enchanting poet.
 Zarathustra claimed that some of us could become supermen.
 First, our spirits would need to brave the desert like camels, forsaking our past, our heritage, all the values of common people.
 Once we had finished forsaking, we would metamorphose into lions and proceed to slay the dragon called "Thou Shalt".
 After burying the dragon, the lion would die and resurrect as a child, the infant superman, innocent and forgiving, a new beginning, a sacred Yes.

"What's wrong?

 Rachel's promise somehow seemed like it belonged from another time.
 The sincerity pulled me further out of my safe, numb shelter.
 Something in me wanted to confide in her, was willing to risk the pain of facing reality, but I was too far gone to be able to put what I was feeling into words.
 I shook my head again, not sure if it was a refusal or something else entirely.
 Rachel took it as the former and sat down next to me, pulling her knees up tight against her chest.
 A few seconds later I heard the howl of an after-market exhaust fed by a turbo-charged engine.
 The green Honda that came screaming through the parking lot was hardly recognizable as an Accord.

I'd never been invited to any parties, let alone cool ones.
 I'd never felt the lack too strongly, but I smiled and let Britney keep talking until Mr. Whethers realized it was time to start class.
 I quickly gathered we'd be reading Wuthering Heights, a prospect that both elated and disappointed me.
 After seeing how far behind I was already in Biology, it was nice to know we'd be working on something I'd already been through twice.
 On the other hand I hadn't liked the novel the first time I'd read it, and when I'd gritted my teeth and sat down for a second attempt I'd found I liked it even less.
 Maybe I just lacked the maturity to appreciate Bronte's so-called masterpiece, but I couldn't stand that her characters were almost all really nasty people.
 I wondered what else we'd be reading.
 I could always ask Britney, but the odds of her knowing anything useful seemed pretty slim.
 When the bell finally released us from an analysis of Heathcliff's early depravity, Britney asked what my next class was.
 She was elated to find we were both headed to Algebra.

 Art ‚Äì Yeah, but to go from protesting God, to joining a church within a matter of weeks is rather an extreme turn-around even for our Gene.
 Jim ‚Äì If it had to do with religion I would agree.

I don't remember his exact words, but essentially it came down to the fact that there'll always be people who're better than me at something.
 Even gaining super powers wouldn't change that.
 What's important is that I do the best I can with what I've been given.
 As crazy as it sounds, Alec's pack needs me."
 I mentally reached around for something similar and then finally nodded.
 "I guess I can understand that.
 My mom would have a hard time functioning without me, so I try to do the best I can at taking care of her."
 Rachel's smile lit the room up.
 "That's it exactly.

"Fair enough.

 The question seemed to take her by surprise.
 "Um, Gone With the Wind.

 I felt my eyes go wide.
 "That's a pretty detailed analysis of a book you've never read."

‚ÄúBe careful now and enjoy yourself!‚Äù ‚ÄúRight I will‚Ä¶‚Äù I said uneasily.
 No doubt that I was going to be very careful indeed.
 I stepped outside and the door closed behind me.
 My mom and dad watched from the window, waving happily to me.
 I returned a slow, uncertain wave and hurried off towards the park.
 As I entered the park, I spotted the rising public art statue.
 The shape twisted and stretched towards the sky, trying to touch it.
 Now that I really thought of it, it did look like a thorn.
 I dropped my bag and leaned my back against the statue, closing my eyes.

I put off the ordeal as long as I could, waiting until everyone but Britney and I had exited the room.
 Britney looked particularly unhappy.
 Mrs. Campbell was looking at my homework when I reached her desk.
 "I was prepared to tear into you for not going to the tutoring lab last night, but that hardly seems fair seeing as how you went ahead and did the work by yourself."
 I felt a small glow of satisfaction flare into life, but her next words ensured it didn't get out of hand.
 "Of course, you've got the right answers, and technically you're attacking the problems correctly, but you're leaving out a couple of steps that I think will give you problems a bit later on.
 Please take my advice and spend a little bit of time at the math lab.

 But as Rodregas assumed no one had died, he had to smile.

It was petty, but I waited inside the room until the clock showed exactly the time the lab was supposed to finish, and then joined Britney outside in the oppressive heat.
 The air was so dry I could nearly feel it pulling the moisture out of my body as we started around the school towards where Britney had parked her car.
 As we reached the west side of the building, the high-pitched growl of a performance engine tore a hole in the relative silence.
 The edge of the student parking lot was just barely in view now, but it was enough to see the source of the noise.
 A tiny figure barely recognizable as Rachel, was walking towards a dark-blue bullet bike, which had just roared to life.
 We had to walk several more steps before I recognized the leather-clad, dark-haired figure on the bike as Alec.
 My feet must have unconsciously slowed because Britney was now several steps ahead of me and looking back impatiently.
 I tried to catch up, but Alec chose that moment to look up and stare in our direction.
 He was quite a ways away, and his lovely eyes were covered by a pair of sunglasses, but I somehow knew he was looking at me.
 He handed Rachel a helmet but continued to look at us, at me, while she put it on.

 "Why don't we find you a nice, simple dress?"
 Rick asked the next day after they'd bought towels and lotions and visors and sunglasses.
 She smiled, hugging his arm.
 She hadn't even mentioned the dress.

 "Right then, I believe there is a vacancy next to Ms. Samuels in the back."
 People were still trickling into the room, so at least I was spared the full gantlet, but the few gazes I met were still unfriendly until I reached the last table.
 The skinny-ish blond girl already at the table smiled at me as I sat down.
 "Hi, I'm Britney."
 I didn't know what to make of her.
 She looked like the type who was always on the fringe of the popular crowd.
 She was the girl who was the first to follow whatever fad happened to be in, and the first to turn on someone if it would make her just a tad more acceptable to her peers.
 I mumbled a response, something that wasn't rude, but which couldn't be mistaken as pleading for friendship.
 Those kinds of girls loved to laugh at the 'poor, desperate, friendless' types behind our backs.

 Mrs. Campbell shot us both a glance that didn't bode well for any attempt to get out of class without a stern reprimand, but allowed us to go to our respective seats without comment.
 I pulled out the two assignments I'd done the night before, and passed them up with everyone else's homework.
 Realizing the lecture wouldn't do me any good, I pulled out my book, and started reading the next section in my self-appointed study regimen.
 Mrs. Campbell either understood what I was trying to accomplish, or was saving up all her venom for after class.
 She didn't call on me even once.
 Britney wasn't so lucky, and I caught a nasty look from her each time I surfaced from my textbook.

 No one said anything and Emily produced a pencil out of her bag.

I didn't like it, but I'd learned to accept it.
 He didn't need to finish that particular sentence though.
 They'd gone easy because today was Ashure Day, and once the dance finished up, he'd be facing off against Brandon, and it would be stupid to tire himself out when he was going to be fighting for his life.
 It was a thought pretty much guaranteed to stifle a conversation, but I managed a smile.
 "Only you would come back dripping in sweat and say you took it easy."
 Alec's smile was a bit strained at the edges, but the tenderness on his face was genuine.
 "I don't know what I'd have done without you these last few weeks."
 My heart went pitter-patter, but still mindful of the fact that throwing myself at him would just result in him freaking out and keeping me at arm's length, I managed not to go all gooey on the outside too.
 Unfortunately the effort meant I was slow responding.
 He moved on before I got anything out.

It wasn't until I tried to decide which of the two remaining wolves was Dominic, that I realized the next smallest figure wasn't a wolf at all.
 The pitch-black shadow that padded towards me was some kind of cross between a leopard and a jaguar.
 A low growl rippled up out of Alec's throat as the large cat got closer, but she dropped to the ground and rolled onto her back.
 I started forward, but Donovan's hand closed around my arm, pulling me up short.
 Alec's gaze never left the prostrate shape shifter.
 He let her remain on the ground for several seconds, and then his chin dropped in an unmistakable nod.
 Moving with what had to be exaggerated care for someone capable of such speed, she rolled back onto her paws and crossed the remaining distance between us.
 Donovan released my arm as she reared up and placed her front paws on my shoulders.
 The colorless eyes didn't match any of the pack's human form, but they had Dominic's gentleness.
 She dropped back down and butted her head against my hand.

Mom's chuckle was almost genuine.
 If Alec hadn't implied she was going to suspect I'd been up to no good, I probably wouldn't have even noticed how off she sounded.
 "You're right, dear.
 I shouldn't have doubted you.
 I just had a few kids come hiking past this morning talking about this massive party the entire school was at last night.
 I know it's completely irrational, but I kept thinking about you there with all that alcohol."
 I was so nervous about answering her question that I didn't realize she was headed over to shut my window until she was already so close that there was no hope of intercepting her.

 They turned to leave and Grey entered with two spits of meat and wine.
 It almost seemed like a celebration.
 Almost.
 Their high spirits hadn‚Äôt quite returned from before.
 I wondered how long I had been out.
 I wondered where the councilmen who‚Äôd attacked us were now.

Humankind has employed itself ever since the dawn of civilization.
 So long as people have wants and are willing to work to fulfil them, there need not be a shortage of jobs for all who seek them.
 The problem today is not a shortage of money or technology.
 The problem is that we have constructed a hermetically sealed economic system that does not permit all people to express that willingness.
 Even if we reached the advanced stage of technological development that enabled one-tenth of the world‚Äôs population to produce all the goods and services to which all humanity could ever aspire, what would prevent us from distributing that work in such a manner as to provide everyone with the opportunity to acquire the purchasing power to consume their share of that over-abundance?
 The main limit on the production of sufficient goods to create prosperity for all is not material, financial, or technological.
 It is the inefficiency and arbitrariness of the present economic system that fails to take advantage of the vast latent market potential of nearly half the human race.
 Give these people the chance to work and they will create the markets to provide jobs and higher incomes for everyone.
 The single act of removing the artificial subsidies and import barriers for agricultural products in industrial nations that protect the jobs of so few in the West, and deny jobs to so many in developing countries, can help realign global labour markets, creating vast scope for employment generation in the South that will act as an engine for industrial exports and full employment in the North.
 Ultimately, the achievement of peace and prosperity for all does require an enormous investment of resources, but the resources demanded are human resources that dwell within ourselves, waiting to be tapped.

By the time English rolled around my natural embarrassment had given way to actual anger at Britney for starting it all.
 She tried to catch me at our lockers in between classes, but I pretended not to hear her, and made it safely into Mr. Whethers' class before she could catch up.
 Part of me acknowledged how petty it was, but I avoided her attempts at a whispered conversation during class.
 Mr. Whethers unknowingly helped my cause, when he crossly silenced a couple of girls on the far side of the classroom.
 He was normally so even-tempered that even his moderate rebuke instantly shut them up.
 I probably shouldn't have felt quite so happy about it, but I was pretty sure from the way they'd been looking at me that I'd been the source of their gossip.
 When the bell finally released us, I couldn't avoid Britney any longer.
 "Adri...ana, why didn't you tell me?"
 I didn't answer for several seconds, not sure I'd actually heard her right.

I wondered how many more days of traveling we‚Äôd have.
 I didn‚Äôt see a peak‚Äîdidn‚Äôt even know if we were going to the peak of the mountain we were on‚Äîbut I was too cowardly to ask, to think about what had happened, so I distracted myself in the journal.
 My sister hasn‚Äôt spoken to me since our mother passed.
 I wish she was‚Ä¶ different.
 Not merely a different personality, but different altogether.
 I can remember the stories in my mother‚Äôs journal about her own sister.
 They were so close.
 That was, of course, until my father.
 But I suppose my sister might be different as well, if not for him.

To my shock, I found something I had never seen before.
 I watched for hours before I was sure, too stunned to believe it possible.
 I had heard stories, the fairies were always puffing dust about it, but I‚Äôd never believed it.
 Was I really watching humans?
 I was pulled from reading, confused.
 Humans weren‚Äôt real.
 What kind of book was this?

 No doubt some readers will agree with my friend Don Merritt and wonder why I‚Äôm allowed on the loose.
 I had a blog called Writing and the Spirit which I suspect Don read so that, at the least mention of any Christian thought or word, he could express his horror.
 In response to a post about Michelangelo having devoted his last years motivated by the idea that his work could assure his salvation, Don wrote: ‚ÄúI still cannot believe that the Ken I knew in the old days can use these phrases [win his salvation, eternal life, the principles Jesus taught] with a straight face, that you really believe these odd, old, irrational superstitions.
 Maybe you have already gone over the edge.‚Äù He could be right.
 Even believers might think I am crazy, or worse.
 I have often wondered if imagining Eric or Olga as my companion, confessing my sins and other secrets to them, is not only neurotic, but possibly blasphemous.
 All I can give for an answer is: when Pam was in seminary, one evening she lamented, ‚ÄúEvery time I come up with a good idea about some Biblical thing, a professor says ‚ÄòOh yes, that was the so and so fallacy, which was ruled heretical by this or that council in .
 .
 .‚Äù Whereas Don Merritt thinks I‚Äôm crazy, I prefer the word loco, which in my vocabulary means something less judgmental.

It was hard to decide whether my excitement at seeing the biggest jerk I'd ever met humbled outweighed my dislike for Alec, who'd pretty much locked up the honor of being the second biggest jerk.
 A surge of dread washed through me as Vincent backed closer to the wall in an effort to maintain his distance from Alec.
 I half expected for the incredible tension I'd been feeling before to disappear, but instead it morphed slightly.
 If I hadn't known it was absolutely absurd, I would've said it felt like there was a tingly wind blowing down the stairs, pushing Vincent along before it.
 Isaac moved slightly.
 It was a small change of position, but somehow incredibly menacing.
 It wasn't until Vincent froze in place that I realized Isaac's shift had kept Vincent squarely between him and Alec.
 It was like watching a pair of wolves bringing down an elk.
 I'd seen gangs work together like this before, but it seemed strangely out of place in Sanctuary.
 I was positive there was going to be a fight after all, but then Vincent grabbed some poor freshman, shoved him into Isaac, and pushed his way downstairs as Isaac caught the human missile.

He weighed over 200 pounds and he could do some damage any way he beat us.
 The primary goal when getting beaten by a person nearly twice one‚Äôs size is to limit injuries and not escalate the violence because there is no winning.
 I had seen this tactic with my grandfather and my uncle, and my brother and I were now in a similar situation.
 When someone saw the marks or bruises on our bodies we lied so we didn‚Äôt get a repeat performance.
 Gym teachers or other kids during showers after PE class asked the most questions.
 We just blamed it on each other as a fight between brothers.
 We just learned to live with it and survive.
 We became quite the fighters at school and other kids learned not to screw with us or we would beat them down.

I looked around to verify that all of the usual suspects were there.

 I smiled at Rachel and then flipped open my math book.
 Everything went just like normal, and promptly at five I closed my binder and started stuffing books into my backpack.
 I looked up to find Rachel standing in front of my table.
 "Are you ready?
 James had to leave early, but don't worry, we've still got a ride home."
 I think I managed to keep the disappointment off of my face.

I also had a horrible feeling, deep down that made me know that this wasn‚Äôt a dream but some type of vision.
 This was happening in real life, right now in Igneeria.
 That proved that Igneeria had worse things to hide than what we thought was bad.
 The thing walked forward and the crowd parted to make it a path, falling silent.
 I find myself creeping back until I could barely see the scene below.
 I was afraid that it would see me.
 Then I got a glimpse of what it had killed and I had to hold back my tears.
 The poor body of the dwarf who had brought us here was lying in a contorted heap, limbs twisted in all directions.
 The scene was awful and I had to prevent myself from throwing up.
 Then I knew why they beat and killed him.

Suddenly, my vision changed and I was a hawk, attacking, tearing a piece from his tongue.
 And Chevelle.
 He was in so many of my dreams.
 We were sparring sometimes, clashing swords.
 Sometimes he was pummeling me with rocks.
 Other times, the moments would have surely made me blush, if I could have felt my cheeks.
 He held my face in his hands, declaring his need for me.
 ‚ÄúI have wanted you since the moment I first saw you.‚Äù But the word burned.
 Wanted.
 He‚Äôd used the wrong word.

Qurrah glanced up, tried to speak, and then swore as the elf leaned around the corner and fired another arrow.
 He did his best to dodge, but he was far less mobile than his brother.
 The arrow pierced between his left shoulder and collarbone, burying the barbed tip deep in his flesh.
 The half-orc let out a stunned gasp.
 He staggered right, clutching his shoulder as he slumped against the front of a home.

I sat on the ground next to Seth.
 His eyes were closed and he looked dead.

 I removed my hand and looked over at Emily.

While it did not draw blood, the jolt of it knocked the elf to one knee and gave her a dull ache in her head.
 ‚ÄúHave you lost your mind?‚Äù Aurelia asked as she rolled away.
 Harruq‚Äôs mad charge was her answer, and it sparked fear in her heart.
 Sword strikes assailed her impossibly fast.
 Any thought of the fight being practice left Aurelia‚Äôs mind.
 It felt too real.
 She stayed defensive, parrying with all her skill while constantly dancing away.
 Harruq pressed closer, and every time the elf pulled out of a roll or landed from a leap backward, he was upon her.
 Notch after notch covered her staff as the swords chopped harder and harder.
 His strength grew as the fight progressed.

Rodregas thought Doi‚Äôvan was learning far more quickly than any of the squires that he had trained with as a teenager.
 Doi‚Äôvan looked like a daemonic nightmare, and he clearly loved to test his strength in battle, but he was an amazingly quick learner both with the forms and with the books.
 Even though Doi‚Äôvan could not read, Rodregas would read him some of the Grimoires, since they were the only books they had.
 His insights and questions were insightful, and Rodregas realized that Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs intellect was greater than his own.
 Two weeks into the routine the three were starting to get into the rhythm; they had moved into the old house and for not having a roof, it was pretty comfortable.
 Though they had all claimed rooms of their own, they were all still sleeping in the living room, partly because of the fire they kept there and partly for the company.
 They were surprised with visits by the two Dire Cats on a regular basis.
 The first evening, when they were settling into the night, the two cats casually walked through the door.
 The three of them froze while the two cats just sprawled out in casual comfort close to the fire.
 One of the cats (Rodregas had not been able to tell the two apart yet) stretched over and started to rub her chin against Rodregas‚Äô leg.

Should the people of any country themselves prefer an alternative system, let them freely make that choice by electoral process.
 Suspension of voting rights or of the privileges of membership should be the ultimate penalty for the failure of governments to comply with this condition within a reasonable period of time.
 The affirmation of democratic principles cannot and will not stop with the domestic governance of member countries.
 It is inevitable that the same principles be extended to the relationships between the nations that make up the international community.
 The present structure of the UN system is a product of the Second World War, just as the League of Nations was of the First.
 The Allied powers conceived it at the height of the war and evolved its structure to reflect the immediate post-war realities.
 Russia, the USA, France and the UK emerged from the war as the arbiters of the world order.
 The defeated Axis powers, Germany and Japan, were relegated to the back ground.
 Mainland China had become communist and was therefore excluded from the power structure.
 India and the other colonies had not yet gained their freedom.

I just said it because a father does whatever he can do to help his son.
 At least that is what I had always thought and that is what I had always done.
 Brandon looked at me as if he wanted to stop me but he lacked the clarity to speak, desperation the only thing evident on his weary face.
 The days since Brandon‚Äôs arrest had been some of the toughest days of his life.
 We know that the practice of turning your busted drug users and dealers into snitches was nothing new in the world of illegal drug distribution.

 They certainly don‚Äôt have a book that can teach you how to be a good father and my own experiences as a son and a stepson had only given me insight on what not to do as a father.

She was no help with my queries so I was forced to look around myself.
 Whatever had been there lived a little like the imps.
 And there were imp tracks there, but it appeared only one.
 A massive numbers of bowls and jars littered the camp.
 I have no idea who would need so many.
 The fairies like containers, but not of this crude sort‚Äîthe craftsmanship was almost that of a troll.
 I tried to stay on the opposite side of the camp from my sister‚Äôs wrath, but I found tracks and had to follow them near her, stirring up another fit of rage.
 The prints were shoed, about the size of elves, but the treads were irregular.
 Whatever stayed here, there were a lot of them.
 Near the center of the camp the ground was beat down with tracks, circling a ring of stones.

But I had to clean the blood from my face and straighten the nest of hair on my head.
 When I leaned forward, a flash caught my eye.
 For a moment I thought the pendant was reflecting light from somewhere in the dark hallway, but my brain must have been still muddled from sleep.
 I examined the stone closer and saw blood had gotten smudged there as well, so I rinsed it clean.
 I lingered there, clutching it tight in my hand.
 It was a comfort to hold.
 It seemed to warm something deep within me.
 I vowed to keep it on as I shook away a thought from the dream coming back to me and headed for the door.
 It was a gloomy day and I didn‚Äôt miss having to squint away the bright sunlight.
 Early as it was, I decided to take the long way to town, meandering through the fields and thinking of all that had passed in the last days, until I reached a patch of weeds that reminded me of Evelyn‚Äôs taunting.

Right now it was just another reminder of how many things in my life I didn't have control over.
 No, that was right out.
 I thumbed through Pride and Prejudice for a few minutes, and then just gave up and headed to the bathroom.
 A short time later, teeth brushed and face washed, I swung my window wide open and climbed into bed.
 It would take hours for the air to cool down enough to start leeching some of the heat out of my room, but it was better than nothing.
 I'd at least sleep better for the second half of the night.
 As tired as I was, my mind didn't want to shut down yet.
 Mom didn't seem to think it was at all odd that the city had flip-flopped so completely on the job.
 First she had it, then she didn't, now she did again.
 None of it made sense, but she seemed perfectly ready to accept everything at face value.

The older boys shook themselves and then looked for a second like they were going to try and get Alec kicked out of the theater.
 The sense of being caught in some kind of electric sandstorm momentarily intensified, and then faded away as they got up and left.
 I felt my mouth drop open again as they scurried out of the theater without once looking back.
 Alec, who I'd always figured had the depth of an old-style Mickey Mouse cartoon, had just faced down two older boys, and singlehandedly saved my Les Mis√©rables experience.
 Valjean launched into 'Who am I?
 ', and almost against my will I was pulled back around to where I could see the stage.
 Even as enthralled as I was by the music, I made a mental note to thank Alec after the performance.
 For once I wasn't going to try and get the best of him verbally, I was just going to walk up and thank him.
 The sense of being able to feel Alec behind me didn't diminish during the course of the play, if anything it gradually increased almost to the levels it'd been during the face-off with the college boys.
 Now though, it felt more reassuring than threatening.

 He was still backing away, holding his hands in front of him palms out.
 A wordless hiss escaped my throat as I felt the fire coursing through me light in my hands.
 He would burn for this.
 Burn.
 I was standing now, walking step for step toward him as he backed away.
 He said nothing, his face calm as the fire flared and I raised my hands to strike.
 And then everything went black.

Marie was disappointed, of course, but Rick wasn't sure it was a good idea for her to drive alone, anyway, and she'd eventually want to do that if she had a license.
 Besides, he was putting together a surprise for her that he knew would take her mind off driving.
 Marie was doing laundry Thursday afternoon when the phone rang.
 Putting down the lid and turning the machine on, she ran to answer it.
 "Hello?"
 "Hi, sweetheart--how is everything?"
 "Fine.
 I'm doing the laundry."
 "I have a blue shirt hanging on the bathroom doorknob--" "I found it.

Again and again it happened.
 I ran a calculation for how many pulleys we'd need to lift our weight up the thirty-degree incline on a string able to hold only a fourth as much, only to look over at his paper and see not only had he already arrived at the correct figure, he'd already thought to adjust for starting friction.
 Not used to being outclassed academically, I got flustered, which led to a misplaced decimal, and then an incorrect conversion from English to metric.
 Alec just continued on, never seeming to really hurry, never actually making a mistake, but still grinding through calculations with a speed I might have been able to match on a good day, but couldn't even approach today.
 It would've been much easier to just stop my efforts and watch him work, but I was too stubborn to give up.
 Alec finished up with the theoretical portion of the assignment, and started stringing the pulleys while most of the other groups were still arguing over whether or not they could afford to add a few extra grams for extra credit.
 If there was a single person in the class who¬†didn't¬†need any extra credit, it was Alec; but he calmly loaded the system with an extra sixteen grams, caught Mrs. Alexander's eye, and then smoothly started the train of weights moving up the ramp, over the wall, through the woods, and right up to Grandma's house.
 It wasn't fair that someone who missed so many days of school could be so consistently right.
 He must have an IQ of 160.
 That and an ego big enough for someone twice as smart.

Brandon for once didn't have an easy comeback to defuse the awkwardness.
 If anything he looked slightly uncomfortable himself.
 "I'm sure it's nothing important..." He trailed off as my traitorous hand found his arm of its own accord and started pulling again.
 I wasn't sure why I was so anxious; usually I avoided crowds like the plague.
 Maybe I was just trying to prolong our time together.
 I let go as soon as we reached the fringe of the crowd, and prayed it was only my imagination that made me think Brandon was just the slightest bit relieved.
 Luckily there was plenty to distract me.
 It looked like there'd been some kind of war behind the school.
 The flagpole had a massive dent in its base, and actually looked like it was leaning slightly to one side.
 The straggly grass, kept just barely alive by the nearly non-existent rain and infrequent watering by some anonymous grounds keeper, had been torn up.

He rushed toward it and I followed, unsure why he was running.
 The noise was made by a small boar and the human was chasing it.
 He ran after it, gasping for air, and I followed close behind, thrilling at the spectacle.
 The boar approached a ridge of rock and turned, giving the human the advantage.
 He leaped after it, blade held wide, and landed, slicing into its side and twisting the blade back out.
 He was leaning over its small motionless body, heaving for breath, covered in blood.
 I laughed, shocked at myself, but filled with excitement and amusement.
 He stood, whirling to face me, bloody blade held out.
 I had to stifle another laugh.
 I managed to keep my reaction calm, only a smile.

I wanted them to stay right there, where I could watch them.
 I tried to make him feel safe.
 ‚ÄúYou know, I could protect you.‚Äù He was incredulous.
 I decided to show him.
 I stepped forward, noting his unease at my movement, and faced the boar that lay on the ground behind him.
 He turned to see what I was focusing on.
 I was afraid to scare him too much, so I decided on a small gesture.
 I held my hand out in front of me, emphasizing the action as I twisted my wrist in the air, the boar‚Äôs head spinning, the sound of its neck cracking in tandem with my movement.
 He gasped and stepped back from me.
 I was afraid for a moment I‚Äôd shown him too much.

 He spoke the word with an odd reverence, but they both understood its significance.
 Unlike the humans, the two brothers‚Äô skin was dark and tinged with gray, their ears long and curled to a point.
 They were half-orcs, condemned for the tainted blood coursing through their veins.
 The people of Veldaren hurled the word at them like a dagger, but in truth neither had ever seen a full orc before.
 ‚ÄúNow we‚Äôll finally see,‚Äù Qurrah said, ‚Äúwhat we are, what we are meant to be.‚Äù
 Thousands of orcs spilled into the west, needing no light to see in the darkness.
 They howled and cheered, drums and war chants mixing with the shrieks of the skulls.

That is why they are here.‚Äù We topped the ridge, jagged rock and loose dirt shifting beneath our feet, and Ruby dropped the quiver by the edge before climbing down with a deftness I had yet to master.
 Steed, Anvil, and Grey greeted us before we resumed training.
 I tried to keep my mind off the wolves, off the reason we were training, off the encounter with Chevelle, off all of the terrible things it kept returning to, and I was grateful for the fog that clouded my thoughts.
 Though I wasn‚Äôt exactly winning matches, I was getting better.
 The battering continued, and long days of constant fighting were making me tired.
 We took a break and I leaned back on a rock, staring at the sky as I rested.
 Chevelle walked me to the edge of a tall peak.
 The rock mountain ended in a sheer cliff, straight down into haze.
 He looked into my eyes like he saw something there, like he really knew me.
 We gazed out over the cliff, at the horizon‚Ä¶ endless.

The tent is ripped from the ground and tumbles away leaving a clear view of the black helicopter that is lowering itself closer to the ground.
 The helicopter is about thirty feet above the ground, and now just behind the podium, over the limos.
 The side door slides open revealing two men in black suits.
 Everyone starts to dive for cover.
 I am seated next to Grandpa but I am now flat on the ground with the rest of the crowd attempting to duck the flying flowers, tripods, and debris, expecting a shower of bullets.
 Chairs are scattering as they tip over and who knows what those two men in the helicopter are going to do?
 I look up and the only man standing is Grandpa who has his arms in the air as the wind from the copter pounds him and ripples his suit like a flag in the wind.
 This deeply religious (and senile) old man proclaims loudly ‚Äúthe lord has come to take my son!‚Äù and he continues to repeat this line as if he is a TV preacher in a revival tent.
 I have an eye on the copter and a hand on Grandpa‚Äôs leg as I attempt to pull him to the ground with the rest of us.
 People are barely audible but they are screaming and crying and in total panic.

He stopped partway through shaking his head.
 "I can't promise he'll even bother to read it, but I'll take it to him if you promise never to talk about this again.
 I don't want to hear even the slightest rumor anything unusual happened in association with this project."
 I nodded, relieved I'd have a chance to jot down a couple of lines, that I'd at least have that much of a link with our protector.
 Mayor Wilkenson waited at the door, almost the perfect picture of a gentleman at his leisure, but his desire to be done with this whole affair was almost palpable.
 I hurried back to the kitchen counter and tore a piece of paper off of the tablet I'd been drawing on.

Incidence of malnutrition among children under five years of age remains severe in both Africa and South Asia.
 But the problem is more complex than these numbers suggest.
 Although India is considered a food surplus state, it is home to the largest number of undernourished people in the world and access to a balanced diet and clean drinking water is far below the basic requirements for sound health.
 Projections indicate that over the next decade growth of the world‚Äôs food supply will be adequate to meet the needs of all human beings.
 The UN Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of human beings suffering from hunger and malnutrition between 1990 and 2015 is highly commendable, yet achieving it would still leave an unconscionably large number of people without adequate food.
 More can and must be done in the next decade to eradicate the scourge of hunger.
 The problem of water scarcity is even more pervasive and challenging.
 Studies indicate that by 2015 more than half the world‚Äôs population ‚Äì mostly in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia and Northern China ‚Äì will be living in countries that are ‚Äòwater-stressed‚Äô.
 In the developing world, more than 80 per cent of the water is utilized for agriculture, an unsustainable level that is depleting water tables, increasing soil salinity and accelerating erosion.
 Although historically water has often been a source of contention between communities, it has never been the cause of an open inter-state conflict.

"Class is about to start, and if every one of you isn't where you're supposed to be before the bell rings, you'll have detention for the next month."
 Vincent's hiss was still almost inaudible.
 "This isn't over."
 I felt my knees almost collapse as the two packs slowly backed away from each other, and Jasmin joined me inside the classroom.
 Mrs. Campbell gave the two of us a considering look after reading Jasmin's note, but sent us off to a pair of empty seats at the back of the classroom without comment.
 We were starting a new unit, but I couldn't concentrate on the lecture.
 Alec's unshakable calm over the last few days had mostly convinced me the other members of his pack had been overreacting.
 Somehow I'd come to believe the coming dispute with Brandon's pack would be resolved as easily as a normal teenage dispute.
 After experiencing such intense, barely restrained violence, I was starting to see just how ludicrous that'd been.

Back then we didn‚Äôt have options as kids either.
 There were no toll free hotline numbers to call to safely report abuse and we knew better than to tell anyone what was happening behind closed doors.
 If we kept our mouths shut we would hopefully avoid making him even angrier.
 He weighed over 200 pounds and he could do some damage any way he beat us.
 The primary goal when getting beaten by a person nearly twice one‚Äôs size is to limit injuries and not escalate the violence because there is no winning.
 I had seen this tactic with my grandfather and my uncle, and my brother and I were now in a similar situation.
 When someone saw the marks or bruises on our bodies we lied so we didn‚Äôt get a repeat performance.
 Gym teachers or other kids during showers after PE class asked the most questions.
 We just blamed it on each other as a fight between brothers.
 We just learned to live with it and survive.

Rested, she opened the box containing the exercise movie Rick had gotten her and with delight put it into the BCR.
 No--VCR, she corrected herself.
 She got so involved in the exercises and then exploring the house that she'd only watched one of the movies--"Gone with the Wind," which made her laugh sometimes and cry sometimes and held her spellbound the entire time--by 5:30, when Rick got home from work.
 ‚ÄúWould you like me to get you some more movies for tomorrow?‚Äù Rick asked Marie as they prepared dinner together.
 ‚ÄúI still have that other one to watch.

 Rick added some seasonings to the sauce he was stirring.
 Glancing at Marie, he saw that she had a mushroom on the cutting board but was just staring at it.
 ‚ÄúIs something wrong?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre staring at that mushroom pretty intently.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh.

 His warrior self was nowhere to be seen.
 ‚ÄúSeth how‚Äôd you do that?‚Äù I asked.
 He whirled around.
 ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù ‚ÄúMe, you idiot!‚Äù I snorted.
 He stared at the place where I was standing, but his eyes weren‚Äôt focused on me.
 ‚ÄúJazell?‚Äù ‚ÄúObviously, are you blind?‚Äù ‚ÄúI can hear you but can‚Äôt see you.

A half-hour into the trip we all, even Steve, regretted bringing Tom.
 All the way over the mountains, he had criticized us, for opening a window, calling for a pit stop, and choosing the wrong direction at a crossroads.
 In the desert he turned into a pyromaniac, pelted us with fiery sticks and blew one of our sleeping bags to shreds with cherry bombs.
 At last, a few of us chased him off into the night.
 In the morning, we couldn‚Äôt find the long crowbar we had brought for loosing boulders so we could roll them and watch them crash down the hillsides.
 We supposed Tom had stolen the crowbar and sold it to another camper then bummed a ride home.
 That Sunday morning, on the biggest and flattest of all the canyon‚Äôs boulders, Eric stood as though at a pulpit, arms outstretched as in the ‚ÄúJesus body picture‚Äù while he consulted our copy of Zarathustra and recited, ‚Äú‚ÄôMan is something that shall be overcome.

"I hope you get back, Marie.
 But if you do, I'll miss you."
 Her throat was suddenly sore.
 "I-I think you have some lint on your back."
 She embraced him, whispering, "Thank you for everything.
 I'll miss you too."
 She gave him a smile before turning and walking into the garden.
 When she found herself at the edge of it, she veered right, seeing that it extended farther in that direction.
 She deliberately tried to lose herself, since that was how she'd gotten to 2011.
 And she knew that Rick would find her if she didn't get back to 1927.

The blade broke through and cleaved his skull in two.
 The other brought his sword down too late.
 Salvation tore through his chainmail.
 Harruq whirled on him, a quick double strike knocking the sword from his hand.
 Helpless, the man staggered backward, clutching his wounded side.
 His eyes pleaded, but his mouth would dare not say the demeaning words.
 Harruq cut him again and again.
 His arms, his chest, his face: it all bled.
 But he remained alive, at least until that final moment when the two magic blades scissor-cut his neck.
 Harruq sheathed his swords and held the decapitated head of his foe high above him.

I stole a glance at him out of the corner of my eye.
 He didn't look threatening, well, at least no more so than usual.
 Anyone with that many muscles was at least a little threatening.
 But he was just sitting there casually, driving along, seemingly without a care in the world.
 In fact, he wasn't buckled in either.
 "Isn't that a bit hypocritical?
 I mean you tell her to buckle up, but you're not buckled up yourself."
 Alec shrugged.
 "Yes, I suppose it does look hypocritical at that.

Alternative Use of Military Resources
 National and international security can no longer be conceived in narrow military terms.
 Ethnic conflict, drugs, environmental degradation and pollution, famine leading to civil unrest or massive migrations of refugees, high levels of unemployment, urban crime and violence constitute threats to both social stability and the preservation of a productive material base.
 Curbing drug traffic, preventing nuclear and chemical contamination, stopping soil degradation and deforestation, augmenting food production capabilities in deficit areas ‚Äì all directly and substantially contribute to the security of society.
 The attention given to the anticipated monetary savings from reduced military spending has directed attention away from the potential benefits of utilizing other resources controlled by the military for addressing these threats to security, particularly for the alleviation of poverty, protection and restoration of the environment, and management of natural disasters.
 The military possesses a vast array of resources ‚Äì human, educational, scientific and technological, medical, organizational and logistical; in training, in engineering and production, in communication and transportation, in construction, land and housing ‚Äì that can be employed to meet non-military security challenges.
 Many of these resources can be utilized for these purposes without necessarily removing them from military control.
 Especially in many developing countries, the organizational and managerial capabilities of the military far exceed those of other agencies and represent a precious resource for addressing these other security threats.
 Participation of the military in these activities necessitates a wider conception of both security and the role of the military in meeting security needs.
 Coping with the serious challenges from environmental and developmental security threats requires the mobilization of a wide range of scientific, technological and physical resources presently utilized for military purposes.

She dropped them as they ran, sometimes snapping their necks, sometimes breaking a leg so they would have to stay alive to watch their homes burn, their families die.
 There was a large man who forced me to do magic, testing me until I was on the brink.
 He was fierce and wore a long scar across his brow that touched his cheek.
 He kept his hair cropped short, not wanting to hide any part of the damage.
 And my mother, though my dreams gave her two names.
 Dark hair, blowing in the wind, arms outstretched, the pendant hanging at her neck glowing fiercely.

Brandon became sicker every day that his frail body went without the Oxy it craved to survive.
 Brandon had lived away from our house for over a year and he looked like a ghost of himself.
 His eyes were dark, his enthusiastic personality was gone and his mind seemed permanently altered.
 He was 23 years old, 6‚Äô 2‚Äù and his weight was hovering at a skeletal 130 pounds.
 We had Brandon on complete lockdown at our house with no visitors allowed, searching his room and the entire house daily.
 We ordered professional quality drug tests so we could test him every day.
 Brandon experienced the worst of the drug withdrawals in the first few days after his arrest.
 My wife, Lisa sat on the bathroom floor with him during his lowest moments.
 He vomited until he had nothing left.
 He curled up in the fetal position, chanting inaudible ramblings and contorting to the point that we had to pad the doorframe and cabinets with towels to keep him from banging his head and limbs.

Their beady dark, red eyes sent shivers down my spine.
 I slung my bow back over my shoulder and grabbed my hunter's knife from its sheath on my side.
 One stopped and raised its head up towards me.
 It opened its mouth to reveal rows of sharp, yellow fangs.
 A chuckle escaped its mouth.
 ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do with that, half-ling?‚Äù it said with a voice that sent needles into my skin.
 ‚ÄúA knife won't do a thing against something like me.‚Äù I almost listened to the thing and started to lower my weapon but I caught myself.
 My hands started to shake.
 Its eyes glistened with hunger.
 ‚ÄúYou can't even hold a weapon.

The only thing I have to look forward to are the few breaks I get to go out on my own, into the pines.
 Father has increased my work periods to every other day.
 Combined with my other duties, I am stationed in the castle almost all week.
 The magic practice exhausts me or I would sneak out at night, the way I enjoyed as a child.
 It doesn‚Äôt seem fair.
 My sister is practically ignored.
 Father clearly prefers me, but sometimes I wonder if that is really better.
 She wanders idly around the castle, no practice, no duties, no formal gatherings.

Emily listened quietly but when I got to the part that we were supposed to go there, her mouth fell open.
 ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs completely crazy!‚Äù Emily gasped.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre supposed to just leave and go there?
 What about our parents?‚Äù ‚ÄúHe told me, and I quote, ‚ÄòMiss did you not think that her majesty would have this all planned out?
 You don‚Äôt have to worry.‚Äô I personally think it‚Äôs all a little skeptical, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said, digging for a pencil and paper from my bag, ‚ÄúI do.
 We don‚Äôt even know who this ‚Äòmajesty‚Äô is and if this information is reliable.
 I understand the Half-way part, that makes sense, but the destiny part doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù I sighed and sat down on the log.
 ‚ÄúThe dwarf said to meet him tomorrow morning near ‚Äòthe thorn that reaches the sky.‚Äô What does that mean anyway?‚Äù Jason stepped over and spoke instead of Emily, who was furiously writing everything down, as if she‚Äôd forget in a couple of seconds, ‚ÄúIt could be a description of something in town, maybe a building or a landmark.‚Äù I suddenly got an idea and took another piece of paper out.
 ‚ÄúHey Jason maybe you could draw what you think it might be and that would help us.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try my best, Jazell,‚Äù he said.
 I knew that his drawing would probably help us.

Brandon's voice washed over me like silk, carrying away any desires I might have had to walk all the way home just to prove a point.
 Not trusting my voice, I nodded and took the couple of steps needed to reach his passenger door.
 "I wanted to apologize for what happened earlier today.
 Cassie can be a real jerk sometimes."
 It was too good to be true.
 I almost looked over at him, but I knew I'd lose myself in a pair of soft, gray eyes.
 Brandon seemed to understand that my silence meant I wasn't convinced.
 "You wouldn't believe how relieved I was when you stepped forward and stopped her before things got out of hand."
 My natural pessimism reasserted itself, undaunted by the fact that I could just see Brandon's exquisitely-muscled arm out of the corner of my eye.
 "If you knew Cassie was in the wrong, why didn't you stop her?

The double doors leading to the private solar were also of Night Bronze, however the door was covered in intricate wards and symbols.
 The guardsmen's armor was less decorated and held only an engraving of their sigil animals.
 The guard on the right had an engraving on his Pauldrons, the piece of armor that protects his shoulders of the Celestial beast know as The Stag while the man on the left had an engraving of The Mastiff.
 After a moment, that seemed to stretch longer than was polite, the Immortal Guard to the right slowly nodded and with no hand touching it; the two massive doors opened to welcome him into the sanctum.
 Van‚Äôdret hurried through the open doors before the guard changed his mind.
 He normally found the sight of the Immortal Guards reassuring; the great sigil warriors were sworn to the protection of Immortalist, like himself, but he knew these two would cut him down like a common pauper if they sensed he was a danger to their Master.
 There was a short hallway leading from the doors with slim white columns on each side of the hallway, in between each column hung great pieces of art; paintings, sculptures and even a small wall hanging with amazing vibrant colors with a strange abstract design were all preserved in the space.
 Van‚Äôdret was a man of some refinement and appreciation for art, and he wished he had dared to stop and inspect the pieces; they had to be some of the greatest art works in the Realm to be so on display where only those who had been invited to a private meeting with Taiga would see them.
 However Van‚Äôdret dared to do nothing more than glance at them as he hurried forward.

She laughed again.
 "You might have lint on your back too."
 She put her arms around him.
 He smiled down into her face, which was now tantalizingly close to his.
 He quickly pressed his cheek to her hair, tightening his arms for just a moment before releasing her.
 "Come on--let's go see what else we can find."
 He took her to a drugstore, handing her a 20-dollar bill and wandering off when he realized that there were some toiletries she needed but was too embarrassed to pick up while he was watching.
 When she was done, he took her to a jewelry store, thinking she might like that, but there was jewelry in 1927.
 She was much more interested in the electronic gadgets next door, and she spent ten minutes exclaiming over the effects of a blacklight.
 When he bought her one, her face came alive with delight.

 It was heaven.
 It was hell.

He must have been more familiar with the powers of the various creatures.
 Doi‚Äôvan had walked past many of the figures until he stood at one toward the back.
 The shape was a powerfully built dragon with wings partially spread as if getting ready to fly.
 But unlike a real dragon this one had three heads at the end of long serpentine necks; one was that of a wolf, one was of an eagle and one was of a lion.
 ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù he asked Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúA Bunei.
 They are powerful fighters, but also lead packs of daemons in combat and have powerful magical abilities.
 Most of these others are powerful and dangerous, but a Bunei is more than a simple fighter of the Infernals.

The Green Revolution was originally applied to improving productivity of wheat and rice in high potential areas.
 After the first rounds of phenomenal success, the effort to extend it to other agricultural regions and other crops lost momentum, because the urgent necessity had been eliminated.
 Recognizing the importance of agricultural surplus to rural employment, industrialization and exports, renewed efforts are called for to apply the comprehensive, integrated approach of the Green Revolution to high potential commercial crops and to all regions.
 With the knowledge gained over the past 30 years, greater emphasis can be placed on ensuring that the productivity improvements are not only economically viable but also ecologically sustainable.
 Region-specific strategies should be adopted for mountain areas, high rainfall tropics, uplands and irrigated plains.
 The crops covered should include foodgrains and oil seeds, cotton and jute, sugar cane, fruit, vegetables, dairy, meat, medicinal plants, spices, and agro-forestry for fodder, fuel and industrial raw materials.

 The complex task of planning, managing and executing nationwide programmes to eradicate food shortages may be beyond the political, administrative and management capacities of some governments, hampered by the absence of training and experience, political instability or social strife.

 The interests of global peace, political stability and basic human rights justify and may necessitate external assistance to help countries establish viable food security systems.

She met me at the door, dressed in casual sweats and no make-up.
 Despite looking a little weary, she looked like she could be very attractive if she tried.
 As I looked at her, I felt sorry for her because I knew she was about the same age as my sons and I knew she was somebody‚Äôs daughter, somebody‚Äôs baby and I also knew the sordid details of her existence.
 She led me into a surprisingly clean bedroom that had a complete bedroom set and a mirrored closet door was beside the bed.
 She pointed me towards a chair in the corner of the room and told me I could get undressed and put my clothes on the chair.
 She excused herself, telling me that she was getting a towel to cover the bed where the massage would take place.
 I thought I could hear her whispering to someone in the apartment, but I only heard her voice.
 Now I was really wondering what I had walked in to.
 I labored to get my shoes off: A well placed moan and groan intended to prompt her curiosity.
 ‚ÄúAre you all right?‚Äù she asked, coming back into the room with a towel and spreading it flat onto the bed, then bending down and helping me untie my shoes.

 Zo√´ Dot Dot
 While driving I‚Äôm inclined to find fault with others who have the gall to use the same road I do at the same time.
 Especially if they are these fellows who have surrouned me on I-5 north of Vancouver, Washington.
 In the rain, with their semis, they spray torrents at my windshield.
 But recalling that yesterday I got blessed for choosing not to judge, I begin to practice understanding these truck drivers‚Äô concern for time and distance.
 Soon I notice that when I go into critical mode, my awareness of the proximity to God shuts down.
 Praise, love, adore, perhaps even admire or commiserate with someone, God joins in.
 Condemn, I‚Äôm on my own.
 So, I have found a new rule to live by: the more I criticize or judge, the less the Holy Spirit cares to hang with me.

Typical cover up.
 ‚ÄúHey Seth, it looks like Jazell didn‚Äôt kill you after all,‚Äù Emily said and flashed me a grin.
 ‚ÄúWhat was that all about anyway, Jazell?‚Äù I opened my mouth to spill the whole truth when Seth glanced at me.
 I sighed at his expression, knowing that I couldn‚Äôt tell anyone if Seth didn‚Äôt want me to.
 I didn‚Äôt want to make it worse by revealing what I knew.
 When I didn‚Äôt reply, she covered her mouth with her hand to try to cover her chuckles.
 ‚ÄúOh then,‚Äù she giggled, ‚ÄúI hope you two had a nice chat.‚Äù ‚ÄúStop it Emily!‚Äù I snapped and felt my face burn.
 She snickered.
 ‚ÄúOkay whatever you say, Jazell.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have to tell you guys something,‚Äù I told her and Jason about how the dwarf had showed up and what he said about Igneeria.
 Emily listened quietly but when I got to the part that we were supposed to go there, her mouth fell open.

 Surprised, she glanced at Chevelle and then back to me, forcing a smile.
 ‚ÄúAre you all right, Frey?‚Äù I stood there baffled, and then remembered screaming.
 I cleared my throat.
 ‚ÄúI was covered in bark.‚Äù Her eyebrows turned up as she looked again at Chevelle, who was mirroring her concerned expression.
 ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs time to allow her a few small lessons.‚Äù Magic?
 It took longer than it should have to realize I‚Äôd unwittingly camouflaged myself.
 This whole thing was going to take a while to get used to.

Marie climbed into bed with a frown.
 She and Davis were going to have to have a serious discussion.
 She didn't intend to have a husband whom she saw only at meals and at bedtime.
 CHAPTER SIX
 Marie awoke at dawn the next morning and jumped into her clothes.
 She was halfway down the stairs when she remembered she'd promised Rick that she'd wake him up so that he could stay within earshot of her.
 "Rick," she called, tapping on his door.
 "Rick."
 "Just a minute."
 Seconds later his door opened, and he blinked down at her sleepily.

The answer was like something you'd expect from a politician.
 It conveyed absolutely no information, and his supreme confidence was infuriating.
 Luckily, I wouldn't have to hold my tongue for very long.
 We were already gliding around the last bend in the road before our lane.
 I expected Alec to slow to a stop and make me walk like James had.
 He slowed, but just enough to make the turn down the dusty lane.
 Rachel jumped out of the car as soon as it slowed down and opened my door for me.
 "Enjoy the rest of your night, and don't lose hope on Les Mis√©rables.
 You never know when you're going to beat the odds."
 Shaking my head in amazement at Rachel's unfailing optimism, I turned to thank Alec for the ride.

I hurried forward, sure I was about to lose both her and the route.
 When I topped the rock, I froze, taking a heartbeat too long to drop to my stomach.
 Just over that ridge stood a group of elves, though after my pulse settled, I didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd seen me before I‚Äôd fallen back.
 I wasn‚Äôt quite close enough to hear, but didn‚Äôt see a better vantage point.
 I squinted, examining the figures.
 Ruby‚Äôs red curls gave her away.
 She had tossed back the hood of her cloak and was laughing with a large elf.
 Steed, I was almost sure because of his stance.
 I scanned the darkness and found two other figures.
 One was about the size of Steed; the other was thinner and appeared fidgety, even in the darkness.

It seemed familiar somehow.
 He‚Äôd let his guard down, and though strained with worry and fear, there was something else there, sadness or maybe just plain sympathy.
 ‚ÄúThis is a good place to stop for the night,‚Äù Chevelle said, breaking my trance.
 I‚Äôd barely noticed the day pass.
 A glance at the path behind us showed the lake far in the distance below.
 It shook me from my stupor.
 I climbed down from my horse to stretch my legs over the trunk of a fallen tree, facing the mountain top instead of the view below, some part of me unable to accept the distance and height we had traveled.
 Chevelle led the horses to a thickset tree, its limbs stretching low and wide above the rocks.
 His hand spun to form a trough from the bark and tinder scattered beneath, the horses drinking as he used the same method to gather grasses from the sparse patches on the incline.
 Movement up the mountain caught my eye and I looked to Chevelle in alarm.

It caused me physical pain to think about Chevelle‚Äôs touch, about council, about what was happening, and I knew it was the bonds.
 When Grey walked out, my trance broke and I noticed Ruby by the front window, wearing an odd smile.
 I flushed and turned from her, rolling into a ball on my blankets, remembering no more than the feel of his skin on my neck, the quirk of his lips.
 I had to keep distracted, and there was nothing for it but the book.
 I wasn‚Äôt able to find much regarding humans in the study‚Äôs library.
 But I had been right.
 Illustrations and descriptions matched what I had seen.
 I know I took a risk extending Rune‚Äôs spell further, but I did not want to get caught, definitely not followed.
 I wondered if my sister was still at the original camp.
 Surely she wasn‚Äôt bright enough to figure it out.

The terrain sloped beneath them as they climbed a hill.
 Another quick shift and they were stumbling down that same hill.
 The cold hand vanished.
 The cloud dissipated.
 Before him, standing with his arms crossed, waited Velixar.
 Qurrah stunned his brother by falling to one knee and bowing his head.
 ‚ÄúGreetings, master,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúI have brought him as you asked.‚Äù
 Delighted, Velixar grinned as he surveyed the tall, muscular half-orc.
 As with Qurrah, he saw the untapped potential, incredible strength, and skill waiting for a purpose to harness it.

‚ÄúHe is the man that you appear to be, whose body you now‚Ä¶ have,‚Äù responded the maiden.
 ‚ÄúAnd what are you five named?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 There was a pause at his question.
 He knew this was an important moment because once people say who they are they are much less likely to do violence.
 Rodregas did not understand the reason, but he knew that to be true.
 ‚ÄúI am Imeralda,‚Äù said the AElf maiden.
 Then came the Hellborn, ‚ÄúMy name is Doi‚Äôvanaomeraldioan, but humans usually call me Doi‚Äôvan,‚Äù he stated in a slow careful way in a very deep, deep voice.
 The leader, after a pause, said, ‚ÄúI am Audrian of family Corin.‚Äù The other two men identified themselves as Brit and Geor.
 Geor, the one with the torch, was blond and like the other men, unusually good looking and well built.

She was proud of her work.
 The eyes that stared back at me in the reflection grew large as they took in her mastery.
 Gone was the girl I‚Äôd been in the village.
 This woman, dressed in leather and dabbed with war paint, was striking, imposing even.
 Her dark gaze might have been fierce if it weren‚Äôt round with astonishment.
 Ruby was thrilled at my response.
 She bounced twice and clapped her hands at her success.
 And then she was over it.
 ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs eat.

 Aurelia nodded, tracing her hand across the dirt.

 The half-orc smiled at the name.
 ‚ÄúIt even looks all pretty,‚Äù he said, eliciting a laugh.

An additional 260 million people will enter the workforce during the 1990s.
 Employment in the East Asian economies is projected to grow by 37 per cent between 1990 and 2000, while the labour force will increase by only 17 per cent, leading to an increasing shortage of labour in the region.
 In contrast, employment growth is projected to lag behind labour force growth in South Asia, Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa.
 Although job growth has once again started in many OECD countries, economic growth alone will not be sufficient to bring down unemployment rates significantly, especially among youth and the long-term unemployed.
 Changes in values, attitudes, structures and policies will be necessary.
 Unless concerted action steps are taken, global unemployment will increase by 130 million during the 1990s.
 Our thesis is that there is a great deal that can be done to prevent this outcome and even reverse the trend, leading to sharply reduced levels of unemployment and progressive eradication of poverty over the next decade.
 How can we make such an optimistic prognosis in the face of the rising number of unemployed and rising concern of governments everywhere?
 Before presenting our case, it is necessary to challenge several basic concepts about job creation and unemployment.

Only he hadn't been able to keep the act up for more than just a few seconds.
 I must really repulse him.
 Physics was my own little personal hell for the next forty minutes.
 I absorbed absolutely nothing from the rest of the discussion about calculating mechanical advantage, and when we were finally released into our groups Alec and I didn't even look each other in the eyes.
 I gutted out the last five minutes by pretending I was completely absorbed in a reference book while Alec started running preliminary calculations.
 He was out of his seat and halfway to the door by the time I'd even realized the bell had rung to dismiss us.
 Spanish was both better and worse.
 Better because without Alec sitting six feet away from me I was able to think about something other than him, worse because we had a pop quiz and I barely placed in the A- range despite having spent a fair amount of time on my vocabulary.
 Math was plain and simply burning up too much time.
 Something needed to change because my only hope of going to college was to get a scholarship, or load up on student loans, and I had no desire to graduate sixty thousand dollars in debt and spend the next fifteen years trying to pay it all off.

Several of those who would now be higher are too injured to continue.
 So you are now in fourth place overall.

 Rodregas nodded.
 The pain was easier to manage knowing that at least he was still in the running for the tournament championship.
 Imeralda stepped into his sight shaking her head, ‚ÄúYou men are crazy sometimes; you actually look pleased!
 If your armor had not held you would be dead now.
 And it is not like you are fighting someone who deserves to die.

 ‚ÄúTrue, hopefully another day of this though and we will be back to fighting those we should be fighting, and it will be far harder to stop me if I achieve a greater sigil.‚Äù Imeralda crouched down, she had a very serious expression on her face, and Rodregas had a sense that he was not going to like what she said next.

Rodregas had long ago learned that it was hard to learn if you were talking.
 Over the next hour Rodregas began to regret his decision to learn.
 Doi‚Äôvan was clearly a master with the staff which Rodregas could not help but be impressed by.
 In the Eastern Realms, and every other kingdom that he knew of, the staff was a peasant weapon.
 As many lords only allowed swords to be for their soldiers and nobility.
 Farmers and crafts people were not allowed to own edged weapons of war.
 Though Rodregas had known such rules to be broken by non-noble families, it was done discretely, usually for keeping a family heirloom.
 During the fairs that most rural areas had fighting contests were common, but they were always matches of wrestling or bare knuckle fighting.
 The only weapons allowed the local workers were the staff and sometimes the bow.
 Rodregas had always regarded the staff as a primitive weapon which no true warrior would bother with, but to watch Doi‚Äôvan with it was breathtaking.

 She set aside the papers on her lap, closing her eyes.
 But seconds later she opened them.

The interesting thing about Steve was that much of the information the officers had on Brandon was from Steve.
 It‚Äôs quite a tangled web.
 Steve had been busted some time ago and released when he agreed to work with the narcotics division of the police department.
 Steve‚Äôs bust was kept a secret so he could fold back into the drug world unnoticed and collect information on drug dealers like my son and share that information with the officers so they could set up these dealers.
 Steve was tasked with introducing undercover officers into the inner circle that would eventually lead to a bust that appeared to be far removed from the original contact with Steve.
 The only problem with Steve is that he was double-crossing the narcotics officers and they had come to discover his deception.
 Steve and his girlfriend, Ashley were highly addicted to Oxy and their combined drug habit made it necessary for him to continue to deal Oxy to the bigger buyers while tossing a few small fish to the officers to appease them and satisfy his deal.
 The officers knew too that Steve was beating his girlfriend and forcing her to perform ‚Äúhappy ending massages‚Äù and sexual favors to support her personal addiction to Oxy.
 Brandon was one of the small fish that Steve provided information on.
 Brandon had become so addicted that he could no longer supply the drug in quantity because he and Tiffanie consumed over $1000 a day by snorting or smoking it.

Rachel was Alec's sister, and he hadn't made a move to save her.
 He hadn't even been willing to let his friends step in and stop the fight.
 I drifted off to History thinking that I would've done almost anything to save my sister.
 It would take a real heartless individual to abandon their own family.
 My anger buffered me just enough to think about Cindi without the usual consequences, but I still wasn't really in top form.
 I was halfway through my class before I realized Mr. Simms had been shooting me dark looks for the last twenty minutes.
 They weren't the obvious nasty looks that kids shoot each other of course.
 They were subtle and infrequent but there was something about the set of his mouth that made it clear he wasn't pleased I was in his class.
 I shrugged it all off and gutted my way through class, eagerly planning what I'd say to Alec when I saw him in physics, only when I finally stalked into Mrs. Alexander's class Alec wasn't sitting in his corner desk.
 I pulled out my notes and started reviewing what I'd managed to learn about our project, stalling until he arrived so I could give him a piece of my mind.

I settled for just nodding as I swapped books and slammed my locker shut.
 Alec pursed his lips for a second and then nodded, not at me, but at whatever decision he'd just made.
 "We'd better get you to your next class.
 Dealing with that will have to wait until later."
 I wanted to ask what he meant, but the halls were already full of other students, and I was pretty sure he'd tell me when he was ready and not a moment sooner anyways.
 With a sigh, I followed him into the crowd.
 A few minutes later I'd been handed off to my next babysitter, James this time, and was safely ensconced in Mr. Whethers' class.
 Mr. Whethers looked more than a little confused after reading James' note, but he simply added James' name to his roll, and then absently waved the two of us towards seats.
 I would've enjoyed English if not for the wildfire buzz created by my little scene with Alec outside of Biology.
 Mr. Whethers repeatedly asked various clumps of giggling and or staring girls to be quiet, but his efforts were largely wasted.

Thinking up new songs.
 I had this record player, you know, with the lid and the swivel arm made of plastic, and a stack of 45s, some I bought at Corondolet in a sealed stack‚Äîyou know?
 Five 45s for $1, and you could only see the top one.
 And it would be something halfway tempting, some Jerry Lee or The Cascades.
 But the others were groups you‚Äôd never heard of.
 But, that didn‚Äôt matter to me.
 I listened to everything.
 At that time everything was equal‚Äîmy taste was still developing.
 So I was indiscriminately borrowing from everywhere, from any 45 that came across my little portable spinner, it was all equal, you know, it was all music, Lee Hazlewood or Howlin‚Äô Wolf or Roy Orbison or Serge Gainsbourg.
 I remember I had this Terry Callier 45, ‚ÄúLook at me Now,‚Äù and I thought it was every bit as good as ‚ÄúRock Around the Clock‚Äù or the Sun stuff or ‚ÄúLemon Tree‚Äù‚Äî(laughs)‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt know, man,  I mean it all seemed good to me.

Did he want to share the mattress with her?
 He did of course, but this was a time of new beginnings.
 Rodregas would live and die like he had always meant to.
 He walked back to the wagon, grabbed another blanket and put it down far enough away from Imeralda to show his honorable intentions.
 But not too far in case there was trouble.
 With a big smile he laid down and slept, like he had not slept in a very long time.
 CHAPTER 6 LUNCH WITH THE ENEMY
 With an eager stride, Van‚Äôdret climbed up the stairs to the rooftop solar of the Guild Dealer Taiga‚Äôs tower fortress...
 He was excited by the honor to dine with the great Immortalist.
 He followed a servant dressed in expensive silks of a drab brown color through the well lit passageways and stairs, all the while nervously straightening his own expensive wardrobe.

"Stand back, everyone, and let me through!"
 It took a few seconds to realize the sub was the one yelling.
 Nobody seemed very interested in making room for him.
 The reason it took so long for my brain to start working again was that I couldn't seem to think about anything other than Alec.
 He was looking down at me with an expression I'd never seen on his face before.
 I still couldn't read it, but it was new and somehow seemed like it belonged there more than his normal impenetrable mask.
 "What's going on?
 Is she okay?"
 The sub had finally pushed his way through the crowd, and looked like he was about two steps away from a total panic.
 Alec stood, and it wasn't until I went up at the same time that I realized he was carrying me.

The majority were covered in bandages stained red with blood.
 Splints holding together broken bones were also in clear evidence.
 At least the enchantment against flying insects seemed to be holding, otherwise it would have been even worse.
 Imeralda led the two men over to a corner where a young man lay; he was unconscious and looked near death.
 From his wounds Rodregas guessed he had been injured during the sword and shield competition.
 To Rodregas‚Äô relief no one was paying them any attention, not even to Doi‚Äôvan.
 Rodregas and Doi‚Äôvan did their best to block the view of others as Imeralda gathered the limp pale hand that should have belonged to an old man, not a young one, and slipped the small frog figurine into it.
 Quickly she channeled the power.
 Rodregas could feel the instinctive rise of the young man‚Äôs own power.

When I finally rose to leave, I stashed a few more of the northern clan documents from the table under my shirt.
 My head was swirling with all that had happened, not simply my new tutor but the magic.
 On my way out I walked past the shelf that hid the body of the now-dead bird.
 I‚Äôd never been able to move objects, but it seemed I had done it without thinking.
 And it wasn‚Äôt just that, but the thistle.
 I needed to see Junnie.
 The door was partially open when I reached Junnie‚Äôs house, so I peeked my head in and called for her.
 When she didn‚Äôt answer, I slipped in to check the back room.
 As I walked through the sparsely decorated living area, I passed a carved mirror on the wall and noticed something off in my reflection.
 I knew I was flushed, I could feel the frustration and worry, but I stopped to get a closer look.

I need to see a healer.‚Äù Rodregas stared at the sorcerer in disbelief.
 He suffered a few minor injuries and he expected they would just go get him a healer?
 The man killed people to steal their bodies and power.
 How could he think they would respond to such a request?
 ‚ÄúPlease hurry, I need a healer now,‚Äù Van‚Äôdret demanded.
 ‚ÄúWe will get you a healer as soon as you finish answering our questions,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan, his voice more growl than speech.
 ‚ÄúFirst tell us who among the Immortalists are trying to break ‚ÄòThe One Law‚Äô and why,‚Äù ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt,‚Äù Van‚Äôdret whimpered.
 ‚ÄúI mean I don‚Äôt know anything about Immortalists breaking ‚ÄòThe One Law.‚Äô‚Äù He suddenly groaned and would have doubled up if Doi‚Äôvan had not been sitting on his chest.
 Imeralda smiled.
 She was poking his two wounds with her fingers.

As he separated her from the male prisoner he whispered to her, ‚ÄúIf you want to live, don‚Äôt do anything until your circle starts to burn, then I will throw the club at the other guard.
 Run and make sure you get out of the circle.‚Äù She jerked towards him as he spoke and Rodregas was struck once again by the beauty of her amazing eyes, but he forced her forward hoping that she could think on her feet.
 Rodregas carefully led her over the outer white circle and into a yellow circle that was across from the Celestial Lion.
 Captain Poir led the man into the pale green circle that was the closest to being in the exact middle and was most strongly interconnected to the other circles.
 As Rodregas crossed into the main circle, the sense of power almost made him stumble.
 He knew his own power was minimal, not much above average, but his few years of training as a boy had opened him up to magic more than the other three guards on the tower roof.
 Rodregas knew that if Ravenhurr had ever thought he had more than basic magic training he would long have been reassigned to a duty far from the ceremony.
 The very air seemed to strum like a stringed instrument with the gathered magical power.
 Rodregas could not help but think about how out of his depth he was trying to interfere with the ritual ceremony.
 However, as he forced the beautiful woman forward, the woman whose name he had refused to learn, he knew he was indeed going to try.

I slid the hawk sculpture into my pocket.
 She hummed as she gathered, throwing a cloak at me in the process.
 I tied it on and drew the hood up.
 ‚ÄúWant me to carry anything?‚Äù She eyed me as if I was entirely absurd.
 ‚ÄúWell, if you would like to, I can find something for you.‚Äù I glared at her back and she turned to grab my arm beneath the cloak, yanking me behind her as we left the house through her closet.
 She replaced the cover that hid the entrance and snatched a quiver of arrows from the ground before pulling me forward again.
 ‚ÄúWhat are those for?‚Äù I asked, indicating the arrows, afraid they would somehow be used in my training.
 ‚ÄúThey are arrows, Frey.‚Äù She was really on a roll today, a delightful mood.

Not until enough of the undead had been massacred.
 He readied his bow, his strong legs the only thing holding him to Sonowin.
 Three arrows pressed against the string of the bow, their tips dipped in holy water.
 His quiver, as was the quiver of every elf flying alongside him, contained water given to them by their clerics of Celestia.
 When their arrows bit into dead flesh, it would be like fire on a dry leaf.
 ‚ÄúLet no life lost this night be in vain!‚Äù Dieredon cried as they descended like a white river, raining arrows into the darkness.
 More than two hundred moving forms halted after that one pass, but a thousand more swayed in their sick, distracting dance.

However, it would be better for him if Poir went looking for Rodregas himself instead, and spread his men all over trying to find him.
 There were only about twenty Ravenhurr guardsmen.
 If they were sent in every possible direction, especially in pairs, there was a good chance that he would come across no more than two of them at a time.
 If they were still confused about whether he was or was not Ravenhurr, he would have an excellent chance of overcoming them.
 On the other hand, if the forces of the guild came after him‚Ä¶ The guardsmen of the Immortalist guild were known as the Immortal Guards and their reputation as the premier fighters of the realm was seldom questioned.
 If they found out what had happened at Raven Keep there was not much chance for Rodregas‚Äô survival.
 After a simple meal, a good rub down for the horses and a few hours of rest, Rodregas got the wagon back on the road.
 If he could keep up this pace, up he could be well hidden before any forces could find him.
 At the end of the second day, before he had come to his last turn off, he realized that he would have to get some sleep.
 He was feeling exhausted.

All ended up on the bed.
 Nothing else of interest was in the wardrobe.
 Though the two fanciest robes both heavily embroidered and of Western Silk, also went to the bed.
 Next, he went to the trunk which was made of High Cedar wood and which matched the large wardrobe, but was much more portable.
 Unfortunately, the only items of use in it were several blankets of good quality wool.
 The remaining contents consisted of drawings, pictures and other personal items.
 Rodregas dumped the trunk contents on the floor, sandwiched the armor in the blankets and loaded up the trunk.
 How he was going to cart the trunk out of the tower he did not yet know.
 He went to the door and listened; it seemed to be getting quieter.
 It was the middle of the night and the stir from the ceremony seemed to have subsided, but it was only hours until dawn when everyone would be heading out to celebrate the new ‚Äòbirth‚Äô of Ravenhurr.

Qurrah chuckled though it felt like hammers pummeled his chest.
 He spread his hands to either side and bathed a few houses with fire.
 The city‚Äôs fear was deep enough he could sense it like a cold breeze, and he wanted it to deepen.
 An arrow whistled by, clipping his ear.
 Qurrah dropped to his knees as a second thudded into the side of a home, inches from his neck.
 A spell on his lips, he spun, grabbing chunks of dirt in his hands to use as components for a spell.
 From two windows, a pair of elves held bows, and together they pulled back the strings and released their arrows.
 The ground beneath Qurrah cracked and tore as his spell completed, so that he fell into a deep pit.
 The landing jarred his back, and he gasped for air, but for the moment he was safe from the arrows that went flying above.
 The fire continued to spread.

 Three weeks after these interviews were concluded, Buddy Gardner was found dead in his home, with a needle in his arm.
 Lorelei had disappeared.
 These tapes somehow also disappeared until 1999, when they were found in a stockroom in an abandoned studio in Los Angeles by a technician there who, with some heaven-sent Extra Sensitive Perception, sent them to Camel Jeremy Eros, c/o City Lights Bookstore, where for a while I was taking my mail, while recovering from a broken relationship, one that emasculated me, silenced me, did me up a treat.
 These tapes were a godsend‚Äîthey took me out of myself, out of the self-pity I was wallowing in.
 Many thanks to John Wender, editor extraordinaire, who recognized what we had here and ran them in his celebrated periodical.
 Hence, they ran first, almost in the form represented here, in three installments in Big City Magazine.

Thoroughly soaked, he changed tactics and ran toward her.
 She screeched and started to run, but he seized her around the waist and grabbed the hose.
 "You're in trouble now."
 He released her and then squirted her.
 Laughing again, Marie twirled in the spray.
 "This is fun!"
 Rick shook his head, grinning.
 "What am I going to do with you?"
 Dropping the hose, he went to hug her.
 "You're absolutely incorrigible."

Emily squeezed the bottom of her shirt, ‚ÄúI hate them so much right now.‚Äù Water gushed onto the street.
 I wrung my hair out.
 ‚ÄúI agree and if we didn‚Äôt need them, I‚Äôd be planning their funeral.‚Äù Emily smiled, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be helping you.
 Do you think they would like pink coffins?‚Äù ‚ÄúTotally,‚Äù I laughed and grabbed my dry bag.
 ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go home.
 Want to crash at my place?‚Äù Emily flipped open her phone, her fingers danced on the keys and paused.
 Then they clicked and she shoved it in her pocket.
 ‚ÄúYup I can.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always one step ahead.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlways.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo what do you think we should do?‚Äù Emily asked from my bed later on.
 I swallowed the bit of strawberry that had been in my mouth.
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, ambush them back?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey might see that coming,‚Äù she pointed out, ‚Äúand it‚Äôs really obvious.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, they think we won‚Äôt do that because that is exactly what they would be expecting, so by actually doing it, we can trick them,‚Äù I rambled on and grabbed another strawberry.

I checked the small section, seeing immediately the symbols fit.
 I smiled, thinking how easy it had been as I slid my fingertips across the volumes on that shelf.
 My fingers tingled as they crossed a thin section of pages bound together.
 I slid them out just as I became aware of some sort of commotion‚Ä¶ that sounded like it was getting closer.
 No, not a tingle indicating what I was looking for.
 It was a protection spell.
 I ran.
 As I shot through the rooms, all I could think of was not getting caught.
 I shoved the pages under my shirt before I made it through the last door.

Strength surged into him, dark and unholy.
 In the blink of an eye, he twirled both swords, knocked Aurelia‚Äôs staff from her hand, and then looped his right arm all the way around to bury Condemnation deep into her stomach.
 Everything, all fighting, all arguing, all bleeding, living and dying halted at that moment.
 For Harruq, there was only the sight of Aurelia doubled over, her eyes filled with sadness.
 His arm yanked the blade out of her, without any thought on his part.
 ‚ÄúHarruq?‚Äù she gasped.
 She fell on her back, still clutching her bleeding abdomen.
 That look of sadness tore through his rage.
 What should have been the exhilaration of the kill was instead the cold, biting emotion of guilt.
 His eyes lingered on the blood on his blade before something changed inside.

They ate in silence until only bones remained, which Qurrah then tucked away in a pouch.
 Harruq relaxed and enjoyed the heat while his brother tightened his robe and leaned toward the fire.
 ‚ÄúThings are more dangerous now, aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù Harruq asked after a pause.
 Qurrah nodded, his thoughts distant.
 ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre ready for us.
 Many elves will be lurking inside the woods as they hunt for the Forest Butcher.‚Äù Again Qurrah chuckled at the name his brother had earned.
 ‚ÄúWill we stop for a while?‚Äù Harruq asked.

I let my beast bubble up from the corner of my being where I usually kept it chained.
 Between one moment and the next, I went from running on four legs to two.
 As my transformation ended, a six-foot tower of muscle and claws sprang from the shadows.
 I ducked Vincent's first blow and retaliated with a gash that opened one side of his chest nearly down to the bone.
 A dark-furred form leaped at Jasmin, but the other wolf mistimed the spring.
 Most of the other pack didn't appreciate just how nimble she was.
 Jasmin dodged to one side and then the two of them were circling, looking for an opening.
 Vincent, the other hybrid, attacked with the strength and fury that'd earned him the position of second in his pack, but he hadn't been expecting to face me in this form.
 As a wolf I weighed in at a solid two hundred pounds, but would've still given up more than a hundred pounds to him.
 Now I had at least six inches and seventy-five pounds on my side of the equation, and he was the one pressed onto the defensive as the fight progressed.

‚ÄúYou seriously think that I assumed you would walk away with me?

 I pulled my arrow out and notched it, aiming it at Kojas‚Äô back.
 ‚ÄúJazell, wait!‚Äù I didn‚Äôt turn around as Emily and Jason skidded to a halt behind me.
 I didn‚Äôt drop my bow either.
 ‚ÄúWait Jazell,‚Äù she panted.

But he was also breathing deeply and through the bond she knew he was trying to control himself.
 Imeralda saw that Rodregas was also watching Doi‚Äôvan.
 She thought he also recognized the danger of a Hellborn rage.
 Imeralda reached out to Rodregas first to try to get him to calm down and help manage Doi‚Äôvan.
 Imeralda focused on their bond and looked him in the eyes and said, ‚ÄúRodregas getting angry will not change things, let‚Äôs sit down and talk to the village elders.
 They are thankful for what we have done.
 They need payment for their risk, but they understand we have needs.‚Äù Rodregas nodded and seemed to be calming down until Jordaan spoke, ‚ÄúNo, you made your agreement.
 Imeralda you have said that the equipment of the Immortal Guard was ours.
 While our warriors are not as renown as some of the other races, we have several who are worthy of such armor and such gear is critical for our own survival.‚Äù Imeralda could see both men‚Äôs renewed rage at Jordaan‚Äôs words.
 She knew she should calm them down, but her first thought was how stupid men could be, men of all races.

 She snickered.
 ‚ÄúOkay whatever you say, Jazell.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have to tell you guys something,‚Äù I told her and Jason about how the dwarf had showed up and what he said about Igneeria.

 I was all the way out to the parking lot before I realized that I didn't have a way home.
 I was still trying to figure out what to do, when I heard the deep roar of a high-performance engine.
 Brandon was clear over at the other end of the parking lot, but somehow he saw me and flipped his car around.
 "You're looking just a little stranded."

 His smile was just as radiant and reassuring as always.

During 1994 and 1995, several major international events will take place.
 The International Conference on Population and Development at Cairo in September 1994, the World Summit for Social Development at Copenhagen and the Fourth World Conference on Women at Beijing in 1995, and the designation of 1995 as the International Year for Tolerance all provide unique opportunities for promoting sustainable and equitable development.
 The past 50 years since the birth of the UN have marked striking progress in every field of human endeavour, except in the areas of ecological and human security.
 We should now concentrate on these aspects of security, so vital for sustained human happiness and fulfilment.
 It is our hope that this report will be of some help in accelerating the pace of progress in the evolution of a new human ethic conducive to human beings living in harmony with nature and with each other.
 M. S. Swaminathan, Chairman International Commission on Peace and Food Madras, India, 6 July 1994
 Preface to the Second Edition Unprecedented Opportunity, Unfinished Agenda
 Humanity is on the threshold of unprecedented opportunities to promote peace and accelerate human development.
 Yet, as in the past, our vision of these opportunities is obstructed by conceptions and attitudes inherited from a bygone era.
 To fully appreciate the emerging opportunities, we need to more clearly comprehend the events of the past two decades that are the seeds from which these opportunities spring.

 Her nod was sad.
 "I told you he was special.
 All of that hard-won civilization tends to flake and chip away when we're that close to our beast.
 Alec always does what's right though.
 No matter what it costs him personally."
 Dom's words were timely.
 Before hearing them I would've watched Alec's near-stillness with unconcern, but now, seeing the way Jasmin and Isaac split their attention between Alec and the wolves they'd just pulled off of him, I could nearly see the effort he was exerting to shove aside the instincts demanding the death of the wolves who'd marked him, who'd questioned his supremacy.
 With a shudder, he relaxed again, and Jessica approached, dropping to her stomach to crawl the last little ways, and then rolling onto her back.
 James dropped down on all fours, grounding the wicked-looking claws tipping his hands, and then it seemed all was forgiven.

I just said it because a father does whatever he can do to help his son.
 At least that is what I had always thought and that is what I had always done.
 Brandon looked at me as if he wanted to stop me but he lacked the clarity to speak, desperation the only thing evident on his weary face.
 The days since Brandon‚Äôs arrest had been some of the toughest days of his life.

 They certainly don‚Äôt have a book that can teach you how to be a good father and my own experiences as a son and a stepson had only given me insight on what not to do as a father.
 Even if this magical book did exist that could help you raise the perfect child, I assume that the chapter titled, ‚ÄúHow to Do a Drug Bust for Your Son‚Äù would be absent.

Rodregas did not stop snapping it until he had the man‚Äôs face looking into the rock below.
 The three sat there for a minute and then stepped away to rest against the far wall to get some distance from Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs body.
 After a few minutes Doi‚Äôvan said, ‚ÄúWell, one more Immortalist down, that‚Äôs good.‚Äù The other two nodded.
 Rodregas said, ‚ÄúWe did not learn much more though.
 We still don‚Äôt really understand why they are interested in Infernal power now and willing to break The One Law.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou mean if that is what they are doing.
 We really don‚Äôt know for sure, other than for Ravenhurr,‚Äù said Imeralda.
 Doi‚Äôvan, sounding like granite, said, ‚ÄúI know Taiga is involved.‚Äù The other two nodded, but did not pursue that thought.
 Rodregas then said, ‚ÄúI agree we are just starting to figure out that there is something big going on.
 I can‚Äôt believe even the Immortalists would be crazy enough to go up against both the Celestial Gods and the Daemon Lordsof the Infernal though.‚Äù Imeralda nodded and said, ‚ÄúWhat price is so high as to be even better than God hood?‚Äù The three sat silent for a few minutes soaking in that question.
 Rodregas looked at Imeralda and asked, ‚ÄúWell, we can‚Äôt answer that today, but how did you break Van‚Äôdret‚Äôs spell?‚Äù Imeralda nodded and with a smile said, ‚ÄúI always hoped that if I had to take on a sorcerer it would be in the Forest where I would have an edge, but no, it had to be in a hallway!

My headshake wasn't very convincing.
 I'd known it wouldn't be, but couldn't manage anything more.
 It was a relief when she chose not to press for more information.
 By the time people started trickling out and my shift started, I'd spent plenty of time watching Britney pout, and very little time actually working on my homework.
 I think it was really starting to sink in that she wasn't going to be able to get out of continuing to spend most of her afternoons here.
 Albert, Mrs. Campbell, and the other tutor all waved goodbye as they left.
 One of the cheerleaders, a particularly whiny specimen named Jackie, wanted help, which I was happy to offer, even in my current state.
 Unfortunately she thought that meant I'd just hand over all the answers.
 We spent a good ten minutes with her trying to offer a variety of covert bribes ranging from the insignificant to things she couldn't possibly deliver.
 I kept telling her I wasn't interested and that she'd just have to do the work.

Biology?
 Character?
 It‚Äôs inexplicable, really.
 All of my roommates had dropped out of high school but somehow I continued; although my grades sucked, they were passing grades.
 In my senior year I only took classes until noon because that is all I needed to graduate.
 I got another job at a local restaurant for the lunch shift as well as any days I was off from the grocery store.
 I realized at an early age that nobody was going to give me anything and if I wanted something I would need to earn it.
 If I didn‚Äôt succeed, I wouldn‚Äôt survive!
 Somewhere around this time, I decided to try and find my biological father, Richard, a natural thing for a young man my age to want to do, right?
 So I tracked him down and called him.

He sought the perfect note, the one that would bring about rapture.
 One night, after a triple billing at the Shell (Black Lung was the middle act that night, sandwiched between the lesser talents of Rubdown and Barry and the White Panthers), Buddy wandered backstage after his set, still in that trance he seemed to enter when he played, and was greeted by a statuesque blond with eyes the color of the Wolf River at Sunset.
 She stepped into his path like a gunfighter.
 Buddy looked deeply into her.
 She was an equation he could not quite decipher.
 Her eyes stayed on his.
 She was bewitching him and even Buddy, already high from making music, was not immune.
 Today people still talk about Lorelei Enos with a wary reticence.
 ‚ÄúNot much is known about her,‚Äù you hear people say.
 ‚ÄúShe came in on a bad wind and left on another,‚Äù one roadie told me.

Soon they were one of the most sought after acts, playing gigs everywhere the area offered, in clubs, at outdoor festivals (happenings), and, of course, their famous half-aborted rooftop gig on top of the Sterick Building downtown.
 Officer Mike ‚ÄúMooncalf‚Äù Milton, one of the arresting officers, recalls to this day how polite Buddy and the band were as they were being ushered into police cars while the mob roared.
 ‚ÄúBuddy Gardner was a gentleman in a jerk business,‚Äù Officer Milton remembers.
 This mildness, this Southern gentleman perception, follows Buddy to this day.
 It‚Äôs hard to find someone to speak ill of him, even those he later abandoned or stepped on on his way to the top.
 He is often compared to courtly though dipsomaniacal photographer Bill Eggleston, a friend of Buddy‚Äôs from those acme days.
 The cover photograph of Black Lung‚Äôs Pepper Records album, Turntable Poison, is an unaccredited Eggleston photograph.
 (It is, of course, a weathered Sinclair sign, imbued with the enchantment Mr. Eggleston brought to all his work, a divergence quite inexplicable.)
 Buddy was loved, revered.
 He was not held to the same rules as everyone else.

I recognized them, but didn't bother putting names to the faces.
 It was like I got hit with another panic attack.
 Somehow I lost an hour, but nobody was running around calling for an ambulance so I must have at least responded to direct questions.
 Alec was sitting in his normal seat as I wandered into physics.
 I tried to remember whether or not I'd already heard the second bell ring.
 It wasn't important though.
 Not compared to the first thing I'd faced in hours that had the potential to hurt me.
 I could feel the edge, razor sharp, cleanly parting some of the layers of gauze that'd been wrapped around my emotions.
 It didn't make sense.
 Alec was barely even civil.

"I swear.

 The pout came back out for a moment.
 "But, if you're not going to let me buy this for you, I'm going to need to compensate by buying something for Jasmin."
 Rachel flounced off, followed by a frowning Jasmin, leaving Dominic to help me out of the straitjacket I was currently using as a dress.
 Chapter 25 I slowly stretched, and then turned over and smiled when I found Alec lying on top of the covers.
 "Good morning, beautiful."
 As always, his voice sent shivers down my spine.
 By the time we'd arrived home, it was ridiculously late, and I'd barely managed to stay awake long enough to bolt down a little dinner after Donovan had helped us unload our haul.
 I'd then done the single most gutsy thing of my entire existence.

 I wanted to know what he meant, but couldn't muster the willpower.
 I already felt myself starting to drift away.
 Even the feeling of him caressing my check again wasn't enough to bring me all the way back to full alertness.
 "Somehow that all changed after you arrived.
 Little by little I started to realize just how empty my life really was.
 I wish I could come right out and say it while you're awake.
 I don't want that life anymore.
 I don't really want any life that doesn't involve you."
 Part of me wanted to scream for joy, to jump up out of my bed and wrap myself around Alec as tightly as I could, but I was just too far gone.

 She turned to look at her mother earnestly.

After a few minutes she stopped and lay down with a sigh.
 The beach was beautiful, and the air smelled so good.
 She liked being here with Rick.
 All morning he'd looked at her like she was a goddess.
 Or a cone of ice cream.
 She giggled at the thought.
 Wondering if Rick had heard her, she glanced over at him.
 He hadn't moved.
 Raising her head, she leaned a little closer to him.
 He was asleep!

 Raising a pale hand, he dismissed them.
 Qurrah turned to leave, but Harruq lingered.
 ‚ÄúMaster,‚Äù he asked, ‚Äúwhen this fight starts, which side will we be on?‚Äù
 His brother narrowed his eyes, knowing exactly why the question was asked.
 Velixar, however, seemed either not to know or not to care.

‚ÄúNobody knows for sure,‚Äù said Jordaan.
 ‚ÄúThe Gods and Infernals do not explain their actions, but most believe that if someone had the full potential to tap into all three‚Ä¶ he would be stronger than either the Gods or the Greater Daemons.
 He would have the potential to rule all the realms and break the great balance.
 This is something that not even the Infernals want,‚Äù he added.
 Rodregas spoke, ‚ÄúSo if Ravenhurr, who was a friend of Taiga, was part of a group of Immortalists who are breaking ‚ÄòThe One Law‚Äô then he might have already added Hellborn power to his own.
 And when I took on Ravenhurr‚Äôs power, I also added the Infernal power, which is natural for a Hellborn.
 It could also be a reason that the gods answered my prayers and helped me succeed against Ravenhurr.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo the Gods might not be against all Immortalists, but just the ones who are tapping into the Infernal power?‚Äù asked Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúAll Immortalists deserve to die for their crimes,‚Äù Rodregas answered.
 His angry response did not surprise the others.
 ‚ÄúAgreed,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan, raising his hand in a calming gesture, ‚Äúbut it might be helpful to understand what the gods will support us doing.‚Äù ‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù Rodregas added.

"There's still a lot you don't know about all of the others.
 There's much I could tell you about Jasmin, but it isn't my story to share.
 Suffice it to say only Dominic has a greater capacity for empathy."
 I wanted to ask what Alec meant, but it was more and more obvious he wasn't going to answer anything he didn't want to.
 We walked in comfortable silence for several minutes before turning off into what I could only assume was the Lilac Room.
 Donovan looked up as we entered the suite.
 "I trust your mother was well, sir?"
 Alec nodded, a short choppy motion that eloquently conveyed his desire not to discuss the matter.
 He turned towards me, only to break off as a cell phone rang.
 "It's for you, probably your mom.

I released an arrow and it buried itself in one of their necks.
 It fell backward and they turned to my hiding spot, searching for me.
 Two knives flew and a dwarf and man collapsed on the ground.
 I saw Jason hide behind his tree again.
 One dwarf got too close to Emily and she raised her arms, dousing him in flames.
 He screeched and fell to the ground, withering and then went still.
 Seth ran from the trees, brandishing his sword.
 He swung it around and clashed with one of the faery's swords.
 The faery brought the other around and Seth twisted to avoid it.
 He grabbed the blade and flung it out of the man's arms.

What is it Seth?‚Äù ‚ÄúI've been hiding this from you for a long time,‚Äù Seth began.
 ‚ÄúOnly Jazell knew what it was because she found out that I was hiding something, and demanded to know what it was.
 So I told her, and ever since I did she's been bugging me to tell you too.
 But I didn't want to, I was afraid that I would get you worried about nothing.
 So far it hasn't turned out to be nothing.
 The incident with the faery guard showed that clearly.‚Äù I walked over to him and sat at his other side.
 I gave him a smile.
 He smiled back and continued.
 ‚ÄúThe faery could have easily stabbed me through the heart but he didn't because he wanted me alive; to give to Kojas.‚Äù Emily gasped and covered her face.
 ‚ÄúWhy, what would he want with you?‚Äù Seth closed his eyes.

Alec's smile nearly made me cry.
 "You know it might be for the best.
 You need some time to get your bearings again.
 Going cold turkey is generally the best way to kill an addiction."
 We'd been through this more than once since he'd killed Brandon.
 He'd been so sure he was going to die that he'd relaxed his normally rigid rules.
 Since then he'd done everything possible to keep me at arm's length.
 Everything short of sending me away.
 Growing up with the example of his mother was a powerful object lesson regarding what happened to humans that got involved with shape shifters; but given enough time, I'd exploit that tiny piece of him that wanted exactly what I wanted.
 "Unless you're sending me away there's no point in having this conversation.

Apparently I wasn't the only one put off by Alec's snobbishness.
 A couple of guys who looked like they were old enough to be in college were rolling their eyes at him.
 They were whispering and laughing, but positioned as they were closer to Alec than to me, I couldn't make out any of what they were saying.
 While I agreed completely with their sentiment, they were so loud they were disturbing at least twenty or thirty people.
 Hopefully they'd quiet down once the actual show started up.
 Judging by the orchestra, it was almost time.
 I looked back, intending to shoot the obnoxious pair a nasty glare in the hopes it would shut them up, and instead caught Alec's eye.
 The house lights were still bright enough for me to make out every detail of his perfect face, and yet I was still baffled by his expression.
 He'd obviously been staring at me, was still staring at me actually, but it wasn't a leer.
 It was something else, it made me want to blush, or maybe smile and toss my hair.

Chevelle walked through the tree line and my jaw clenched tight against a silent curse.
 He was alone.
 He kept walking as he looked my direction, surveying the damage from the fire.
 I was convinced he would know it had been me, but he didn‚Äôt stop or even slow.
 It made no sense.
 Why hadn‚Äôt he investigated further?
 Was he not here looking for me?
 He was my watcher and I was missing.
 So where else would he be going?
 Before I had, regrettably, torched the documents, I had seen Junnie noted as his contact.

 The thought of being courted was revolting.
 Rick had said that they'd both eventually settle for someone else and get married, but she had no intention of marrying anyone else.
 She would never stop loving Rick.

 He opened his hands.
 Fueled by dark magic, the bones shot forth, piercing the elf‚Äôs throat and eyes.
 Against the window his dying body fell, his arms still held wide as if offering an embrace that would never be returned.
 Qurrah stared at the corpse, and as the blood pooled on the floor he felt himself standing once more on solid ground.
 The elves were his enemy.
 His brother was his only friend.
 Velixar was his master.
 Solid ground.
 Qurrah slipped over to the window and glanced out.

 ‚ÄúNot long,‚Äù Harruq said, holding Qurrah‚Äôs shoulder to steady him.
 ‚ÄúThe orcs are almost here.‚Äù
 As if on cue, they heard a collective roar from the south.
 Harruq glanced at the stairs along the wall, but Qurrah saw this and shook his head.
 ‚ÄúWe need to get closer to the fight,‚Äù Qurrah said, slurring his words.
 ‚ÄúI need to see him.‚Äù

While the lasagna she'd made for dinner baked, she made a list of what she wanted to buy the next day.
 They needed new beach towels and more sunscreen and aloe vera lotion.
 She wanted a nice dress to wear in the evening, but she hesitated about putting it on the list.
 She didn't want to ask Rick for anything frivolous, and she'd probably get to wear the dress only once or twice.
 But she didn't want him to be embarrassed by a companion who wasn't dressed appropriately.
 Well, she'd ask him where he planned to take her and what she should wear.
 "Why don't we find you a nice, simple dress?"
 Rick asked the next day after they'd bought towels and lotions and visors and sunglasses.
 She smiled, hugging his arm.
 She hadn't even mentioned the dress.

Jordaan stepped outside the room Rodregas had been staying in and into the small clearing that was the center of the Nymph Dwello, the tent like structure that they used for houses.
 ‚ÄúGentleman, please,‚Äù said Jordaan.
 ‚ÄúYou must have understood that this village took a great risk in taking you, and those you rescued, in.
 The only way Imeralda was able to get their support was to offer the bounty of the Immortal Guard‚Äôs equipment.‚Äù As if called from Jordaan‚Äôs words, Imeralda landed in the clearing, seemingly leaping from one of the nearby trees.
 She looked a bit out of breath, like she had sprinted at a run to the Dwello.
 She took a quick look at Doi‚Äôvan and Rodregas and paled.
 Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs eyes were literally glowing red and he was tossing his horned head with his wild black hair flying.
 Imeralda had not seen him in such a mood before, not even during the battle with the slave caravan.
 Imeralda thought that Rodregas was only marginally better.
 The muscles of his neck and shoulders were bunched up and she could feel his anger through her bond with him.

He reached out and wove his fingers together; he pulled his thumbs down and opened his woven hands in the ancient symbol of opening oneself to the gods.
 ‚ÄúDear Celestials in the heavens, we open our hearts to you and we accept our duties as your warriors here in the world.
 Let your courage fill our hearts and your strength fill our arms.
 May we know the guidance of your twin children, Honor and Justice.‚Äù He then knelt down and pulled one of the two short swords from his weapon harness; he crossed his arms and laid the blade across his own upper arms.
 It was possible, only with great concentration to do this without dropping the sword or cutting himself.
 His instructor had taught the squires this simple prayer.
 It guaranteed that the squires stayed focused during meditation.
 Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda looked at him as he knelt in the grass with the sword naked on his bare arms.
 Rodregas spoke carefully so as not to tip the sword and said, ‚ÄúIt is called sword meditation.
 My instructor would start us out with the prayer and then we would meditative on our duty.‚Äù ‚ÄúFor how long?‚Äù asked Imeralda.

The cold water had thrown her for no more than a fraction of a second, but it was enough time to right myself and execute one quick attack.
 I volleyed a nearby rock, which struck her in the back of the head and threw her balance off for another instant.
 I knew I was larger than her so I gritted my teeth and lunged, grabbing her as I tried to figure my next move.
 She raised her face and, when her eyes met mine, they narrowed.
 Part of me was aware I should have been scared, but I was enjoying myself.
 Whatever pain I might receive didn‚Äôt factor; I had wanted to hurt this wicked little redhead since the first time I‚Äôd seen her, since her hand reached out seductively toward Chevelle and collected my ruby.
 My palms lit where they wrapped around her arms.
 I would finally burn her.
 She cocked one eyebrow at me.
 ‚ÄúHalf fire fairy, silly.‚Äù And I flew through the air to land with a heavy thump a few yards away.

I ducked as it slashed my side and I winced.

 Yes, blue, my blood is blue.
 It turned back around and threw its self at me.
 This time I was prepared.
 I pulled out my hunting knife out just as he landed on me.
 He yelped and went limp.
 I pushed him off and grabbed my fallen bow, the familiar feeling of the wood boosting my confidence.
 I turned back around and started back where I left off, but then a body slammed into me.
 I just had enough time to see the thrasher, before the fur and dirt filled my vision.

The last two minutes of lunch dragged on forever, but then the bell rang and I was left sitting stunned as Brandon and his friends stood to go.
 I let Brandon help me to my feet, hardly noticing the way his touch left my hand tingling, and headed off to class.
 It was stupid, but I couldn't help feeling this was yet another sign I wasn't going to win a ticket.
 I tried to shake the feeling during History, but was still fighting it when I walked into Physics.
 In a departure from his normal routine, Alec was already seated when I arrived.
 I flipped open my notebook and tried to distract myself with a brief sketch, only to tear the page out and ball it up as the bell rang.
 I looked up to see Alec staring at me, which just made me mad.
 It was completely unfair.
 I wasn't going to get to go to Les Mis√©rables, but he was rich enough to fly to New York and book the whole theater.
 As Mrs. Alexander stood up to take roll, a burst of static silenced us all.

But, yeah, we were cracking up even as we rose.
 Maybe rising causes dissolution, right, you can dig that.
 Like Icarus.
 Or, it‚Äôs like Adam and Eve, you know, paradise is full of apples, full of snakes.
 We were in paradise briefly, as we cut that album, made those songs happen, we had it all, chicks, drugs, some money‚Äîthough they screwed us of course.
 We should have been bigger, gotten better contracts.
 I don‚Äôt care about that.
 But, I do care about my songs, man, my damn songs.

Alec's hand was warm on my face as he nodded.
 "You're amazing.
 All the things being taken away from you just because you got involved with the wrong crowd, and you just do what has to be done.
 Of course you can have a few minutes.
 I'm sorry to make you do this."
 I wanted to tell him it was less than he was doing.
 To say it was the least I could do considering this was all my fault, but the unabashed bliss of having him touch me was overwhelming.
 It took surprising effort to string coherent thoughts together.
 Before I managed to do so successfully, he sighed and helped me to my feet.
 "We'd better get back or you'll miss Spanish."

Her mom moved aside so I could walk in.
 I unlaced my sneakers and walked up the stairs, looking at the flower paintings hung along the wall that her mom had painted in her spare time.
 I pushed open Emily‚Äôs bedroom door to see her stuffing her clothes in the drawer and flopping onto the bed.
 She pulled out my bag and threw it to me so I could set up my sleeping bag on her rug.
 Her mom called us downstairs, hopefully for food.
 She held a box of pizza.
 ‚ÄúYou two can eat upstairs or down here.‚Äù She already knew our answer and handed us paper plates.
 I took three slices of pizza and ran upstairs.
 Emily and I sat on the floor, eating pizza and doodling nonsense in her notebook.
 The time ticked by to one o‚Äôclock in the morning.

The college is one of the occupations that keeps me rushing around, the condition that originally clued me I should read Brother Lawrence.
 Pam and I believed God was asking us to found the college to make a place for people in general and Christians in particular who wanted to become writers to discover what they honestly believe, and to write with courage from their unique visions.
 Thinking of Jaime, I can‚Äôt begin to lament the virtually endless hurdles we've been called upon to jump in order to earn and maintain the college‚Äôs licensing, accreditation and the rest.
 Jaime's thesis is superb.
 A novella about a young woman whose Christian parents, when their daughter finds herself in extreme trouble, appear more concerned with remaining in accord with their church than with helping or even trying to understand their daughter.
 Its honesty touches my heart.
 Jaime and I spend a day roaming the city, with an hour stop at the Seattle Mystery Bookstore, which played a role in the final scene of Road Kill, an account of a book tour my friend Alan and I did together.
 At several of the tour stops, including Seattle and Portland, Mike Connelly joined us.
 Since then, Mike has become an international bestseller.

 Jason spun around and began to stab them as I suggested.
 He ducked and I say their number start to drop because of his quick reflexes.
 The swarm's size was reduced to half.
 The syphons were starting to look uneasy, hesitating before they flung themselves at us.
 It didn't matter to me.
 ‚ÄúRetreat!‚Äù one of the voices yelled.
 ‚ÄúFall back!‚Äù They gave one more angry hiss at us and disappeared into the woods.
 The bushes and trees rattled and then the woods were silent.

I fought panic as I wondered if they‚Äôd all made it.
 The worry throbbed in my head; it felt like my mind could splinter.

My mind whirling with too many thoughts to sort out, I turned to go back to my desk, only to find Alec staring at me.
 He still didn't seem happy to be sharing the same room with me, but the complete disgust from half an hour before had been replaced with something more measuring.
 In Spanish, Mrs. Tiggs took special delight in telling us that she'd started grading our tests and a couple of them weren't looking very good.
 I suffered through the last hour of school and then hurried to my locker.
 I didn't really want to meet up with Britney, but I also didn't want to alienate her any more than I already had.
 I shouldn't have even bothered.
 I waited around for a full fifteen minutes before finally heading over to the tutoring lab.
 Britney was watching the door when I arrived.
 She didn't even bother trying to mask the flash of satisfaction that crossed her face when I walked in late, obviously having spent the last little while waiting for her.
 I wanted to scream, or maybe cry.

 Felewen charged, desperate to arrive before her brethren were overwhelmed.
 Aurelia stepped into the street and summoned her magic.
 Frost surrounded her hands, and a thin sheet of ice spread beneath the human soldiers.
 Many of them stumbled, unable to balance the sword and shield in their hands and the heavy chainmail on their bodies.
 Felewen slid on one leg, her sword out and ready.
 She passed right between two men, slicing out heels and tendons as she flew by.
 The elf reached the end of the ice, turned, and went sliding back.
 The two she had cut were on the ground, unable to stand after such precise hits.
 As she reached them, she stabbed one of their legs to halt her momentum, yanked her sword free, and then rolled around to stab the other in the throat.

The rest of the dinner quickly wrapped up, and Van‚Äôdret soon found himself caught up in thought as he journeyed down several floors to the Great Hall that served as the gathering place for the other Immortalist in residence in the city.
 His questing mind was rudely interrupted by a woman stepping to his side and asking him, ‚Äúso did you ask him?‚Äù ‚ÄúAsk him what?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret asked.
 The Immortalist Sorcerer in the form of a tall athletic human female with spectacular long red hair and blue eyes gave Van‚Äôdret a silent glare before responding.
 ‚ÄúLast night at the arena party you agreed to ask Van‚Äôdret where Oreintvenir is,‚Äù She replied in a clear clipped voice.
 ‚ÄúActually,‚Äù Van‚Äôdret responded, ‚ÄúI think I said that my visit to his solar would be a perfect opportunity to ask him if he knew the location of our missing Grand Master.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo why did you not take advantage of the opportunity?
 If anyone knows where Oreintvenir is; it is Taiga‚Äù ‚ÄúMy lovely Gracella, you are an Immortalist of impressive power and intellect.
 But we are Immortalist, time is on our side and Grand Master Oreintvenir has been gone for less than a year.
 It is not unusual for one of his power to be gone for such a length of time.
 He could be anywhere on this world or beyond it.
 There is no need to be in such a... rush to ask questions.‚Äù ‚ÄúVan‚Äôdret doesn‚Äôt play your word games with me, you know, and I know that this is not a normal disappearance.

 When she didn't look away, simply continuing to gaze into his eyes, he slowly lowered his mouth to hers, brushing his lips over hers.

 ‚ÄúStay calm and lie still.‚Äù I tried to convey my incredulity as I lay there, unable to move.

The tall graceful Immortalist had dark robes of deepest black with swirling gold patterns sewn on it.
 His hair was pulled back and to the side in an unusual looking style.
 ‚ÄúMy Lord,‚Äù Rodregas responded.
 ‚ÄúIs there something that I can help you with?‚Äù ‚ÄúI understand that your other servant, the Nymph girl, was out making inquires last night,‚Äù said Van‚Äôdret.
 Rodregas paused at that, unsure of how to respond.
 Finally, he said, ‚ÄúIt is always good to know who your enemies are and who might be your friends.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you have many friends here,‚Äù said Van‚Äôdret.
 ‚ÄúI have those I need,‚Äù responded Rodregas, ‚ÄúI hear, on the other hand, that you are quite popular.
 They say that Nordien carries your colors and is your champion.‚Äù Rodregas thought he saw the Ambassador‚Äôs eyebrow rise slowly, but there was no hesitation to his response.
 ‚ÄúAs an Ambassador to the knighthood I, of course, have no favorites.

Ruby was telling stories.
 She related the tale of Bonnie Bell, a blue fairy from the East.

 Fairy tales indeed.
 It felt good being there, surrounded by my new companions, a fire and stories, laughter.

 But I was also under the influence of a fairy.

 Despite my best efforts, I was mumbling so badly I wasn't sure anything I'd said was comprehensible.
 Somewhere in there I'd closed my eyes, so I felt a sluggish, tired kind of surprise when he gently brushed his fingers across the side of my face.
 The sensation was so feathery I almost opened my eyes to verify that he'd really touched me.
 It was too much effort.
 Besides, I didn't really want to know if he hadn't touched me, it was better to just go on pretending he had.

I'd thought things were tense already, but where everyone had been quiet before, now they were motionless too.
 Cassie spun around and glared at me.
 "Take off."
 I shook my head and clenched my fists a little tighter.
 "Leave her alone."
 For a second I thought Cassie would go through with it.
 Her knuckles went white, and her breathing sped up.
 I knew if she sprang at me, I was going to get really hurt.
 When Brandon's hand appeared on Cassie's shoulder to restrain her, I thought for a second my knees would buckle.
 A few seconds later, it was as if nothing had ever happened.

As Van‚Äôdret stepped through the arch he was struck by the bare simplicity of the solar.
 The city known as the Menagerie of Sky, Earth and Water that Taiga ruled and had created over the centuries was a lush place, full of pleasures and growing things.
 Anything that could be found in the world was said to be found within its gleaming walls and exotic gardens.
 However, the private place where it‚Äôs Master worked, was a stark contrast.
 It‚Äôs marble columns and arched ceiling spoke of simply sophistication and understated power, and much more accurately reflected the nature of its owner than the over the top shows and pleasures of the Menagerie.
 Two small intricate waterfalls softly trickled down each side wall to the, providing a soft soothing sound.
 The back of the room was an archway leading to the terrace, overhead the incredible crystal ceiling let in the natural daylight of the late afternoon sun and would illuminate the top of the tower under its own power during the night.
 In the middle of the room was an enameled silver table set for two, with Taiga lounging in his throne like chair on the opposite side of Van‚Äôdret.
 Van‚Äôdret hurried forward and fell to his knees with his head lowered; he did not say a word until after Taiga spoke.
 ‚ÄúPlease, my friend, there is no need for subservience here; let us enjoy a meal together.

The door remains ajar.
 The hour is still in progress.
 There is still time and that time is now.
 The world today has far greater opportunities that ever before, far greater degrees of freedom within which to act to accelerate progress and eradicate suffering.
 The Millennium Development Goals adopted at the UN Millennium Summit in 2000 represent the essential minimum needs for building a stable, secure, free and prosperous global community.
 We confront once again an unprecedented opportunity and an unfinished agenda.
 Disappointed by our failure to achieve all that seemed possible or disillusioned by the emergence of new, more dreadful challenges, some may feel prompted to curb mind‚Äôs contemplation of the greater potentials, dispense with lofty plans and resign themselves to the slower, circuitous pace of progress that characterized earlier periods.
 That choice would be unfortunate.
 For everything in our experience of the past two decades points to the fact that humankind is now capable of more rapid and radical action to build a better common present and future for all.
 We may have become habituated to the astounding magnitude of the events since 1989 and still feel unsatisfied with the results, but we can no longer deny that we collectively possess the capacity to create the world that we choose to create.

 To me, the key to living well is living in a way that gives an opportunity for appreciating nature and friends and taking time for prayer and writing and helping people.
 And unless you inherit a pile of money, the way to live like that is to not want a lot of stuff.
 Most stuff is just clutter.
 But our culture feeds the desire to own or consume until what we think we need makes us greedy.
 ‚ÄúThe Bible says that we should work so we‚Äôll have something to share with people in need.
 I can work for a few days a week and by not letting myself want a bunch of stuff, I can have money to give away.
 So I‚Äôm careful about what I buy, and I pick the things I do buy for durability and longevity.
 I need a car, so I buy a Toyota.

 next year with near-perfect grades and two minors, in Latin and Spanish.
 Still, his greatness, the character trait that makes me hope someday we‚Äôll find a President like him, is his devotion to do whatever is good and right, though it might be the hardest way.
 A question.
 How, given the world‚Äôs need for such people and his belief that his young wife‚Äôs gifts will make her a mother able to lavish her child with love and wisdom, could a man who, when a novice parent, helped create and develop two such excellent beings as Darcy and Cody decline to make and help raise one more.

 Mighty pleasant work, which we‚Äôre both apparently competent at.

The ruby had been in the vault with my mother‚Äôs possessions, along with the map that had brought us here, and now he was giving this Ruby my ruby.
 I shook my head; there must be a connection, some reason it would end here.
 Ruby drew a package from her cape and handed it to Chevelle, smiling a temptress‚Äôs smile.
 It was about two hands in size, wrapped in light brown cloth.
 He slid it under his cloak and it disappeared from my view.
 I couldn‚Äôt imagine what she had given him, but it must have been in trade for my stone.
 As I peered through the gap in the doorframe, the stranger‚Äôs eyes flicked to mine and I was sure she somehow saw me.
 I held my breath and jerked away from view, plastering myself against the wall.
 When she didn‚Äôt speak up to expose me, my pulse began to slow.

Alec finished up with the theoretical portion of the assignment, and started stringing the pulleys while most of the other groups were still arguing over whether or not they could afford to add a few extra grams for extra credit.
 If there was a single person in the class who¬†didn't¬†need any extra credit, it was Alec; but he calmly loaded the system with an extra sixteen grams, caught Mrs. Alexander's eye, and then smoothly started the train of weights moving up the ramp, over the wall, through the woods, and right up to Grandma's house.
 It wasn't fair that someone who missed so many days of school could be so consistently right.
 He must have an IQ of 160.
 That and an ego big enough for someone twice as smart.
 Mrs. Alexander shuffled over and smiled at the pair of us.
 "Sixteen grams.
 Most impressive, you two.
 An entire gram more than I would have ventured to risk myself, and done before anyone else.
 I thought the pair of you would make a great team."

Harruq took the other sword and held both in his hands.

Some of the people around me were starting to evidence signs of annoyance, but that just spurred the hecklers on to greater heights.
 I was so worried they were going to ruin everyone's experience, that I turned around and shot them a dirty look.
 "Oh, sweetie, don't you worry, we've been aching to get our hands on you all night.
 We're saving plenty of loving for you later.
 Meet us out back after this crap is over and we'll give you a real show."
 My mouth dropped open in shock.
 Nothing was going to get them to shut up now, not when they had such a perfect target.
 Sitting there staring at them was about the worst of all the choices open to me, but I was too shocked to pull my eyes away.
 I felt a surge of heat rush through me as the room wavered slightly.
 For a second I worried I was going to pass out, but movement behind the two punks distracted me from my heaving internal landscape.

I debated where to sit for a second.
 I'd done the right thing in standing up to Cassie, but I didn't want to further alienate Brandon, or put myself anymore firmly in the group of idiots who looked to Alec as their master and liege.
 Before I could finish weighing the pros and cons, Rachel looked up and caught my eye.
 The smile that appeared on her face was tentative but genuine, and completely resolved my doubts.
 I returned her shy greeting with a smile of my own, and sat down at the table closest to her.
 Britney entered the tutor lab a few minutes later, and frowned at me before going over and sitting at the end of the room containing the jocks and cheerleaders.
 Apparently I was supposed to have waited?
 I sighed and flipped open my book.
 As I finished up my second assignment for the day, I realized I was parched.
 My trusty water bottle was empty when I reached for it, so I quietly stood and left the room.

 The elf blocked once, twice, then three times, wincing each time he did.
 Then the other elf was behind Harruq, stabbing at his back.
 While mad with rage, Harruq still knew very well where his opponents were.

The whole point of my existence had been avoiding the kinds of things that'd result in everyone laughing at me.
 Why was I setting my sights on a boy who was so far out of my league?
 Even if there'd been a chance he might like me, I had absolutely no idea how to proceed.
 Given the option, I would've just hid behind the pillar until everyone left for class, but Britney had made her decision, and was paying for her food.
 Essentially out of time, I took a deep breath and followed her to a table.
 I couldn't help glancing towards Brandon's table one last time.
 I was hoping he was still smiling.
 Maybe he'd seen how awkward I was, but didn't mind.
 Maybe he even thought it was endearing.
 Failing that, I at least hoped he wasn't chuckling with his friends over the new girl's stupid infatuation.

 I gasped as the body fell to the ground and even some of the creatures, around stopped.
 They murmured among each other, ‚ÄúShe killed a syphon!

 I made a mental note to tell Emily about this.
 That is, if all of us didn‚Äôt die first.

Even if you can't make it every day, you need to come in a few times a week."
 "Yes, ma'am."
 The scolding actually hadn't been that bad, almost like disguised praise.
 Britney looked like she was hoping for something similar, but Mrs. Campbell's expression quickly dashed that idea.
 "You on the other hand definitely need to spend every night at the math lab.
 Your homework was incomplete, and of the problems you bothered to attempt, you didn't do a single one correctly.
 Britney, you're headed towards a failing grade, and while you might not care, your father most certainly does.
 Make my class a priority, or I'll stop in for a checkup and let slip just how poorly you're doing to dear old Dad, and then you'll find yourself riding the bus to school."
 It was a vicious threat, but one almost guaranteed to have an effect.
 Britney most definitely didn't want to be stuck riding the bus with all of the junior high kids and other assorted 'losers'.

His magic power shot out of the circle and started orbiting the larger circle.
 He was completely gone.
 Rodregas excitedly thought, ‚ÄúVictory!‚Äù He had done it.
 He had killed the Immortalist Sorcerer Ravenhurr.
 The multi-colored energy of his magic swirled around the outer circle and was sucked into the empty vessel of the young man.
 The magic energy throbbed and Rodregas could feel the ritual screaming for the final release of the magic; there was no way to save anyone else.
 Rodregas would probably die in the next few seconds in the magical backlash of the failed spell, but he thought that he had understood the meaning of the final trigger words used in the rehearsal.
 Rodregas‚Äô years of rejecting his early upbringing made him embarrassed to say the words, but he reached down into that deep, nearly empty place where his little bit of power still sparked.
 Rodregas reached deep inside and pulled that spark of power up until he felt the tingle and inner sensation that he always inelegantly called ‚Äòmy itch.‚Äô Rodregas filled his words with the power and the intent behind them.

He quickly found himself on the defensive and suffered both a cut on his upper hand and cheek.
 He started to worry that the knight would end the match and give Karun the victory.
 He tried to use his speed to advantage and trap her sword.
 But he nearly lost his sword instead.
 He realized that he was outclassed.
 Her skills were better than his own and Rodregas‚Äô physical abilities were not so much greater than hers as to counter her superior fighting skills.
 For the first time in the tournament Rodregas lost control of the flow of the match as suddenly she moved in swinging hard.
 Then again, and again, she went in close with her shield wedging it in, and was able to lock it to his left for just a second.
 She swung hard at his open side; he had time to block her stroke but his sword shattered when the two swords collided.
 Her sword was at his throat before he could do anything and the officiating knight yelled a stop to the match, handing the yellow band to Karun and the white second place finish to Rodregas.

‚ÄúWhat do you say we wrap it up for today?
 I‚Äôve got some business with Council.‚Äù I stumbled off the stool, half numb from being still so long, and made my way outside into the warm sun, unsure of my direction.
 The idea of lingering within sight of the village center didn‚Äôt have much appeal, but I was in no hurry to get back home to Fannie.
 Choosing instead a rambling, rarely used path out of the village, I found myself wandering idly through the trees and, eventually, into an abandoned, overgrown garden, where I tried to work out what to do with my now empty afternoon.
 Sitting surrounded by the various weeds, my tutor might have urged me to do something useful, like identify the species, but she wasn‚Äôt here, and I couldn‚Äôt help but attempt to repeat the process I‚Äôd used on the thistle in her study.
 I‚Äôd been warned not to practice without supervision, but the field felt alone as I concentrated on one weed and then on each of the others, spinning my charms in an attempt to develop them.
 I had no luck with the wild flowers and renegade vegetable plants, but a small thorn tree and a couple of noxious strains began to mature in response to the magic.
 All this time, I‚Äôd thought something was broken in me, that something had happened when I‚Äôd lost my mother, but maybe Junnie was right.
 Maybe I‚Äôd just needed to get my focus, to work until it came through.

It wasn't until she was finally in the Jeep and backing down our lane that I finally stopped worrying that Brandon was going to pop around the corner.
 He'd been smugly confident he wouldn't show up before she was gone, but had refused to tell me how he planned on pulling up at my house five minutes after the coast was clear.
 Half of me was strongly tempted to dawdle for fifteen or twenty minutes, but with my luck he'd really manage to show up within the next few minutes, and I'd have to scramble to get ready while he waited for me.
 With a sigh I ran up to the bathroom, brushed my teeth, gave my hair the once-over, and grabbed a light jacket as I left my room.
 It wasn't even remotely as cold here as I would be at home by this late in the year, but the oppressive heat had finally started to wane a little.
 Knowing my luck, if I left it home tonight would be the first time it snowed in Sanctuary in the last two centuries.
 More and more excited about the prospect of going to my first real party, I bounced down the stairs and into the kitchen for a drink.
 I happened to look out the window as I pulled a glass out of the cupboard, and nearly dropped it when I saw Brandon leaning against his car, patiently waiting for me.
 Before I could move out of sight, he looked up at me with a self-satisfied smile.
 I nearly dropped the glass again.

They have $2500 in cash in exchange for the one hundred 80 milligram Oxycontin tablets which are in a small plastic bottle, tucked away into my jacket pocket.
 I have just turned fifty years old, which is older than the combined age of the young couple who will be meeting me.
 It is early 2009, and the drug I have in my pocket was not even available when I was a teenager.
 In my younger days the contents in my pocket would have been cocaine or marijuana, but times have changed.
 The eventual recipients of these pills will be the addicts who crave them more than a next meal or the love of their family, or anything for that matter.
 The pills are small, round and an odd green color‚Äîa powerful prescription drug manufactured to relieve severe pain.
 They are essentially synthetic heroin, and much sought after by the drug addicts who litter your streets, work alongside you and perhaps sit next to you at a family dinner.
 They are daughters or sons or parents.
 The street price for these pills could reach up to $80 each while the co-pay at the pharmacy for the insured who are prescribed these pills could be as little as $10 for a quantity of ninety.
 That is quite a tidy profit for all involved, and the sellers do not care what casualties wait.

She worked as a carhop at a Bob‚Äôs Big Boy hamburger joint and she wore roller skates to serve the drive up customers in their cars.
 My Uncle Dan would take us there at night to visit her and she could sometimes sneak us some food.
 We would watch her roller-skating from car to car and back inside to retrieve her food orders.
 Uncle Dan was a hero to us as he was the only consistent male figure in our life.
 The drive up stations at Bob‚Äôs Big Boy were filled with a variety of Hot Rods and they were in all shapes, colors and sizes.
 The engines revved and the tires squealed consistently as the parade of cars cruised through.
 It was an exciting place and a formative moment for both Thomas and me, and helped to cement our lifelong love of muscle cars.
 We were so proud of our mother and we loved to tell our friends where she worked.
 Our friends would openly wonder why a mother would be working at all.
 It was very unusual in that time period not to have a father.

 She shifted and the markings on her leg caught my attention.
 A thin painted vine trailed up to her thigh.
 She noticed me looking.
 ‚ÄúWell, Frey, I feel like I know so much about you.‚Äù She smiled slyly at Chevelle.
 ‚ÄúBut you know so little of me.
 Let me tell you a few things, since we will be traveling together.‚Äù I felt my head jerk to find Chevelle, not believing what I had just heard.

 "You are an incredibly passionate woman, Marie.

"Fine, but that doesn't shed any light on why you're all the way out here."
 The gray eyes just visible in the slowly growing light crinkled up in a smile.
 "I called her and told her I'd pick you up.
 She can take you home, I'll come pick you up every morning."
 My head was spinning.
 Why would the most popular boy in school want to pick me up for school every morning?
 "You don't need to do that; I can always just ride the bus."
 Brandon flipped open the passenger door and motioned for me to get in.
 I started around the vehicle, stumbling and nearly falling before I finally made it to my destination.
 Brandon waited for me to get my seatbelt on and then gunned the engine, flipping around a hundred and eighty degrees in a maneuver I'd never seen anyone perform outside of the movies.

Require employment assessment of new policy initiatives prior to adoption.
 6.Re-orient social security programmes toward re-employment: OECD countries spend 2-3 per cent of GDP on labour market policies, most of it to support the unemployed.
 The United Kingdom spends nearly $14,000 a year on every unemployed person.
 The United States spends three times as much on welfare payments as it does on retraining the unemployed.
 For three decades, Sweden achieved the highest employment rate among OECD countries based on 'the passionate belief in full employment' and 'the right to work' and on active policies to generate work for all, rather than payments to the unemployed.
 Drawing lessons from the Swedish model, introduce a comprehensive programme of education and vocational preparedness for the unemployed, compulsory retraining for those who are unemployed for more than six months, and a strictly managed penalty system for unemployed persons who refuse successive job offers and do not seek retraining.
 7.Improve labour market information and job placement systems: Labour markets are becoming more and more fluid.
 One in ten jobs is now replaced in OECD countries every year.
 This makes the strengthening of job placement systems a crucial element in any full employment strategy.
 Lack of access to information about job or training opportunities retards re-employment.

Weird huh?‚Äù I almost tripped but I caught myself.
 She pushed us into the woods, ‚ÄúWe got to move fast before someone gets hurt.
 Make sure no one is around.‚Äù In a matter of seconds, I had an arrow in my bow, Seth had his sword in his hand and Jason had his hands full of knives.
 The dwarf was sitting on the edge of the slide, looking like an ugly version of a toddler, and a few more came out of the woods to join him.
 We tried to sneak up without being spotted but one of the dwarves turned his head and saw us.
 He immediately launched himself onto Emily.
 She screeched and I thought I saw one of the kids turn around.
 He crawled up to her ear and whispered something that I couldn‚Äôt hear.
 She froze, but I saw her place her hands on his wrinkled skin.
 Fire flared from her fingertips, scorching his skin.

As his eyes hit mine, I had the feeling I was intruding, that I should look away, but something kept me staring.
 It was him again.
 Chevelle Vattier.
 I swallowed hard and forced myself to continue walking, this time determined not to trip.
 Following the path as it wound closer to them, I became excruciatingly aware it was going to split, heading to either the gate or to the library.
 I hadn‚Äôt decided how to make my escape when Chevelle turned back toward Virden and spoke something low, cutting the conversation off.
 Virden shot me one quick look and stormed into his tree.
 Chevelle remained standing where he was, his back to me.
 I had to decide.
 Walk within feet of him going to the library to research him or run home and hide.

 We used to try to work up a version of ‚ÄúThe Sun Also Rises‚Äù because I could make my voice sound like his raspy delivery‚Äîlikewise Sky Saxon of The Seeds.

Then a voice rang out, ‚ÄúStop, STOP, it is not him!
 It is not the Sorcerer Ravenhurr.‚Äù It was a woman‚Äôs voice.
 Then a much deeper voice, one that seemed half growl, responded, ‚ÄúShe is right.
 This is no sorcerer we fight.‚Äù The voice was from his present combatant, the only one who had proven to be dangerous to him.
 ‚ÄúShe is right,‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚ÄúI am not Ravenhurr.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know that,‚Äù challenged another voice from the dark.
 As he stepped forward he recognized the shape of the large aggressive man that Rodregas had first thought was the leader.
 ‚ÄúIf he is not Gerald, then he must be Ravenhurr.‚Äù There was a silent response to that statement, but finally one of the other men lit a torch and held it up.
 Rodregas quickly realized that in front of him were five of the eight prisoners who had been held in the dungeon.
 ‚ÄúHow did you track me here?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 The one with the torch waved it over toward the lone female of the group, the half AElfin maiden from the tower.

I didn't really want to unpack, but it was long past needing to be done and I knew if I left it to Mom that we'd never really get moved in.
 If I'd had anything even remotely better to do with my Friday night, I would have done it.
 I didn't, so I started with the stuff that we'd piled in the living room because it was marginally cooler downstairs.
 I got into a decent rhythm, opening boxes, pulling out the stuff that I could easily put away, and then consolidating what was left into fewer boxes.
 I was on my fourth box when it happened.
 Mom's jewelry box had somehow got packed into a box labeled 'old photography gear'.
 As I pulled it out to set it to one side, it slipped from my hands.
 The glittering deluge of chains and bracelets that went sliding across the floor would have made me feel bad enough all by themselves, but there was a proverbial scorpion nestled in the midst of all that shininess.
 I'd thrown mine out shortly after the accident.
 Part of me hadn't wanted to.

 ‚ÄúWhat are you babbling about?‚Äù the elf asked, her eyes cracking open.
 Harruq tried to smile, but a sob came out instead.
 He hugged her, his forehead pressed against hers.
 ‚ÄúHelp me up,‚Äù she said.
 Harruq did as commanded.
 When she was standing, he grabbed his blades and sheathed them.
 She leaned all her weight against him, and such close contact only deepened his guilt and anger.
 He knew she watched him, and he wiped away his tears as quickly and subtly as he could.
 ‚ÄúWhy, Harruq?‚Äù she asked him.

He ran to where the sixty elves that had lined the street engaged a large portion of his army.
 They had discarded their bows and drawn swords, wielding them with a precision his men would be blessed to ever match.
 They didn‚Äôt need to, for they had numbers, momentum, and morale.
 When Antonil shoved to the front line, they also had leadership.
 The sixty dwindled to forty before fleeing.
 ‚ÄúGive chase,‚Äù Antonil shouted.
 ‚ÄúThose in the back, flush them out of the houses.‚Äù
 Velixar watched the Neldaren army scatter, some chasing elves down streets, others barging into locked homes.
 Screams of pain and dying, although just few and random, filled the air.
 He drank it in and smiled.

The cry from Qurrah rolled over him like a horde of stampeding horses.
 All his resistance broke away, meaningless, preventing nothing.

 Harruq shook his head, hardly able to believe it.

 She took a minute to get her bearings and then wandered back toward Rick‚Äôs house.

Before I knew it we were back at Britney's locker and she was promising to give me a ride home from school after Spanish.
 History was about as dry as I'd expected, which was really too bad.
 I'd had a good history teacher in junior high, and it was an incredibly interesting subject when taught right.
 Unfortunately Mr. Simms was possibly the worst teacher I'd ever had.
 I mentally shrugged when we were told to open our books and read the chapter to ourselves.
 At least I wouldn't have any worries when it came to catching up in this class.
 Thoughts of Brandon made it hard to really get into the chapter.
 Also, it was hard not to notice the borderline hostile stares from the other kids.
 I sighed in relief when the bell rang, and pulled out my schedule and map to see where I'd be going next.

 The two half-orcs heard the sounding of the horn but did not know its purpose.
 So far from any human soldiers, they could only guess.

 Qurrah shrugged, glancing down the vacant street in search of victims.
 ‚ÄúPerhaps, or perhaps the elves are retreating, or even the humans.

His eyes seemed of no use so he closed them and simply walked toward where he knew she was.
 He felt Doi‚Äôvan grab onto his shoulder and follow him.
 When he opened his eyes, he saw that they had entered another great chamber.
 At first he thought it was the same size as the first chamber until his eyes saw the huge tree in the middle and followed it up and then up.
 The tree soared above them so high that Rodregas thought it must be far higher than the Cathedral itself.
 This was, of course, impossible.
 As Rodregas stopped beside Imeralda he tried to see the shape of the leaf to identify the type of tree, but the leaves were so high up he could only see a very general shape.
 The shape of the trunk reminded him of a white oak, but the color was a darker gray with touches of striped brown.
 The trunk was huge, thicker than the towers of the keep.
 But that made no sense to Rodregas.

Despite my disbelief, I somehow managed to act quickly, stashing the papers in my shirt before attempting a casual exit to read them at home.
 I made it out of the library and almost to the gate when I noticed a dark figure behind Virden Day‚Äôs tree.
 It was Chevelle.
 He was speaking with Virden when he turned his head slowly toward me‚Ä¶ and I was staring into his eyes again.
 Oh, give me a break; he‚Äôs halfway across the village from you.
 But I was staring.
 Despite my resolve, color rose to my cheeks once more as I turned away.
 I couldn‚Äôt understand why he was affecting me this way.
 The pages stuffed in my shirt felt like fire against my skin.

I could feel my mind trying to shut down, hoping to cushion me from the worst implications of what was coming.
 I knew it was going to be bad, could feel it in a sickening, only-seconds-away-from-vomiting kind of way, but couldn't follow the chain of logic through to the very end.
 I let Jasmin help me pull my books together, and then numbly followed her out to the hallway.
 Alec and the rest of the pack were waiting for us at my locker.
 Jasmin calmly opened my locker and put my things away while I was still trying to come to terms with everything.
 Alec took my hand.
 "Are you okay?"
 I shook my head.
 "This is going to be really bad, isn't it?"
 His silence validated my belief, probably even more than he realized.

 There wasn't really any bitterness in her voice, but there was something, maybe the same kind of longing I felt when I talked about Prom.
 "You're probably right.
 That would fit with what I know of Britney so far."
 "Do you need us to give you a ride?"
 I looked over and saw that James was once again glaring at me, somehow having approached to within a few feet without making any noise.

 Ruby and Steed were sitting across from me.
 She was reclined, her bare legs showing where the material of her skirt was pulled to the side.
 When I looked up, she resituated herself, leaning toward Steed and talking low about some nonsense.
 She walked her fingers up his chest as she talked, glancing at me for a reaction.
 She was trying to make me jealous.
 I was suddenly furious.
 She‚Äôd poisoned me and now this.
 I wanted to burn her right then and there.

I didn‚Äôt have a driver‚Äôs license yet, but I had a learner‚Äôs permit.
 I had no car and I walked, bummed a ride or hitchhiked if I needed to get someplace like work or high school.
 It was not easy living on my own and finding roommates at such a young age, but I managed.
 After a short stint of crashing on couches or extra bedrooms of several friends, I rented a room at a house with some other kids near my age.
 I was still in high school and I wanted to graduate, but I also needed money to live on.
 Rent, food, utilities and various expenses were all new to me.
 The father of my girlfriend Lori was an executive of a supermarket chain, and he made some calls and got me an interview.
 The manager explained to me that he would love to hire me but he had a hiring freeze on everyone but minorities.
 I had no idea what this meant so I asked, and he explained to me all the types of minorities that he could hire, including, American Indian.
 I said, ‚ÄúHey, my grandfather was half American Indian,‚Äù and he hired me on the spot.

 The other guards laughed and shouted in agreement.
 They had spread out, flanking the half-orcs on all sides.
 The leader stepped forward and gestured with his weapon.

He was thrilled when she didn't say she'd probably be back in 1927 before then.
 She was quiet during the ride home, remembering the scene she'd done.
 And how she'd peered through a camera.
 And sat in a director's chair as he walked his sitcom actors through a scene.
 It hadn't been a page out of a fairy tale like she'd expected, but it had been exciting nevertheless.
 And a dream-come-true.
 "I feel gritty.
 I think I'm going to jump in the shower," Rick told her when they got back to the hotel.
 "Me too."
 She would have preferred a bath, but she was afraid she'd fall asleep in the tub.

Right when I thought he was winning, my mouth dropped open.
 Time seemed to slow as one of the other faery guys ran over to Seth and the one he was locked with.
 The faery raised one of the hilts of his sword and brought it down on Seth.
 It collided with his head and Seth dropped his sword.
 He crumpled to ground and didn't move.
 ‚ÄúSeth!‚Äù I screamed.
 He didn't move and one of the faery men reached down to grab him but I screeched, ‚ÄúLeave him alone!‚Äù and sent an arrow into the guy's neck.
 I heard Jason yell in rage and they started to drop like stones.
 Emily raised her arms and the ground shook under a faery.
 Roots twisted upward and wrapped around one of the five faery men that were left.

 Harruq mumbled something obscene.
 He nodded, swinging in a low chop.
 As his sword struck her staff, the sparring began.
 Aurelia was familiar with her staff, the wood comfortable in her grip.
 She had no sense of tactic, though, and all it took was a quick feint or two before she left herself horribly open.
 Harruq used only one sword, running it in slow circles, stabs, and the occasional feint.
 He enjoyed the steady workout but savored even more watching Aurelia move gracefully through the air.

Brandon gave us another lazy smile as he stepped slowly backwards to give us more room.
 Alec's tone was still conversational as he shoved Vincent backwards and allowed his hand to return to normal.
 "The harassment of my people stops now."
 "Now why would we do a thing like that when we all know you're a dead man?"
 Dominic stopped just outside of what I was starting to understand was pouncing range for people who happened to have supernatural strength, as Alec gave Brandon a cold smile.
 "If I ever really decide the outcome is a foregone conclusion, you'd better start watching out for your people.
 You'd be surprised just how many of them could disappear if I no longer worried about the consequences of my actions."
 The tingle of Alec's power lessened slightly once we were out of sight, but it still hadn't dropped off completely by the time we were standing in front of Mrs. Tiggs' classroom.
 I could still feel the faintest traces of his power long after he'd finally let my hand go with obvious reluctance and strode off, leaving Dominic and I to find our seats.

"Not really.
 But I'll make you a good dinner."
 She enjoyed her lunch, the conversation as well as the food.
 Rick told her about how easy it was to get on an airplane any day and go anywhere in the world, about machines that made the house warm in winter and cool in summer, about telephones you could carry in your pocket.
 It was all so amazing.
 She'd always felt that she was living in very modern times‚Äîelectricity, automobiles, the new talkie.
 The wonders Rick described seemed like magic.
 They settled down on his sofa after lunch.

It matched the long cuffs on his forearms, the same dark, worn leather of his saddles.
 He stepped closer, taking my chin in his hand to examine my face in the moonlight.
 He purred something toward Ruby about her decorations and gave me a wink as he walked off in the direction Chevelle had gone.
 We were alone then, Ruby and I, and I was sure this was going to hurt more than my other training.
 She untied her cloak and tossed it to land with a muffled sound on the rocks.
 She was smiling a touch as she reached a hand across her waist, closing her fist around a black hoop I‚Äôd not seen before.
 She drew it out and around as a long black trail curved in its wake and came to rest at her side.
 My mouth went dry.
 A whip.
 Oh yes, this would hurt.

 Doi‚Äôvan looked grim.
 But as Rodregas assumed no one had died, he had to smile.
 ‚ÄúIs it that bad?‚Äù he asked.
 Doi‚Äôvan missed his amused tone, or he was simply not in the mood to hear it.
 ‚ÄúThe news is not all good,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan agreed.
 Doi‚Äôvan grabbed the far too small stool beside the bed, which was the only other piece of furniture in the little dorm room that they had been assigned.

Everyone would be so busy looking at the other three girls that they wouldn't even notice me.
 It wasn't ideal, but it was better than nothing.
 A quiet knock brought us all around to find Jessica waiting at the door, her makeup and hair partway done, a dress bag slung over her arm.
 "Can I join you guys?"
 Her voice was scratchy, and her eyes were red from crying, but she was putting on a brave face, and Rachel didn't even hesitate.
 "Of course, Jess.
 We figured you wanted some privacy with Isaac, or we would've dragged you over here hours ago."
 The rest of us were quick to pipe in, but at least on my side, the sentiment was a little half-hearted.
 Unlike Jasmin, Jessica never had come around, never made her peace with the fact that because of me things were going to go downhill in a hurry after tonight.
 I'd tried to get both Rachel and Dominic to explain why she hated me so much, but neither would give me a real explanation.

I'd just never recognized how much I'd depended on her.
 Even that oblique thought was almost too much.
 I felt my pulse quicken a little as the air seemed to vibrate.
 "Look, I'm sorry about how I reacted yesterday.
 I shouldn't have left you here like that."
 Britney's voice was coated with sincerity, but it was the thinnest of layers, one which poorly disguised all kinds of nasty little feelings.
 On the other hand, it distracted my mind from the string of thoughts I'd otherwise have followed all the way down to a full-blown panic attack.
 It was a small thing in the grand scheme of the universe, but it was just enough to tilt the balance in her favor.
 I still didn't like her any more than she really liked me, but I was willing to tolerate her.

It was nearly 7:00 when they left, and Marie was all in favor of pizza in the room this time.
 "I don't think I can wait," she told Rick when he hung up the phone after ordering the pizza.
 "Do you want me to go get you a candy bar?"
 "No.
 I'm going to go take a shower while we wait."
 After her shower she rubbed on some rose-scented lotion.
 Her skin was hot from her day in the sun and just a little red.
 She'd put sunscreen on this morning so that she wouldn't get burned.
 Dropping the bottle onto the bed, she went back to Rick's room calling, "Is the pizza here yet?"
 "Not yet," he replied as he emerged from the bathroom, still toweling his hair dry.

 She started to pout, but I'd already been taken by that tactic once today, and caving in had just landed me in deeper trouble.
 "I'm serious, Rachel; we are not walking out of the store with this dress.
 You can throw a temper tantrum if you want, but I'm not giving in."
 Rachel glared at me for several seconds, and then suddenly smiled.
 "Okay, Adri.
 I mean I was just trying to do something nice for you, but if you're going to be like that, we'll leave it here."
 Her grin didn't engender trust, but when I opened my mouth to call her on it, she forestalled me with an upraised hand.

 Jason hit Emily in the arm and she started yelling at.
 So, this is typical thing to wake up to.
 I stood up and walked over to Seth.
 He looked up from the ground and saw my troubled face.

We do not advocate a return to state socialism or expansion of the public sector.
 As in the case of the environment, the changes needed are in the priority given to achieving different social objectives in the formulation of government policy.
 Recommendations to Achieve Full Employment in Industrial Nations
 Earlier we noted long-term trends that suggest the recent rise in unemployment in the West does not necessarily forebode, and need not necessarily result in, chronically higher rates of unemployment in these countries.
 Granted that the necessary political and social commitment is forthcoming, there are a range of strategies which, taken in the proper measure and combination, can dramatically accelerate job growth and reduce unemployment.
 Each of these strategies has proved effective in stimulating employment, though none by itself may be sufficient to solve the problem.
 A comprehensive, total approach, rather than partial and half-way measures, is needed.
 No industrial country can claim that it systematically exploits all the potential benefits of the strategies in this list.
 This should be the highest priority of every Western government today.
