 "Yes."
 She was horrified when two tears spilled out of her eyes, and she tried to wipe them away before he could see.
 But he noticed right away.
 "What's wrong, sweetheart?"
 She shook her head, but he reached out to tilt her chin up.
 "What's wrong?"
 She sniffed.
 "I don't like to think of your-your .

Steal money.
 Sell their bodies to strangers.
 Encourage their girlfriend or wife to sell her body.
 Anything to get the cash they desperately need to feed the demon that owns them.
 The most extreme way to increase Oxy’s effect is to reduce the powder to a liquid, draw it into a syringe, and shoot it into their veins, warming them from the inside out.
 Sound familiar?
 There is nothing more glamorous about this drug than heroin.
 The same addiction, the same diseases, the same low-down disgusting lying homeless in the alley and piss your pants drug—Oxy is essentially synthetic heroin.
 And the last step, when addicts can no longer afford Oxy, is to get on heroin.
 Lives are ruined or lost completely to this drug, which, unlike the drugs of the past, is found in the medicine cabinets of parents, grandparents and patients with severe pain all over this world.

"I'm not washing my car again."
 I expected Rachel to back down as soon as she realized he was spoiling for a fight, but if anything she looked more determined.
 It was hard to believe this was the same person I'd had to rescue from Cassie so recently.
 I stopped Rachel just before she could put the impressive lungful of air she'd just taken in to whatever use she'd planned.
 "It's okay.
 I'm better.
 The lane's dusty and exercise would do me good."
 She hesitated, obviously torn, but my fumbling fingers finally found the unfamiliar door release and I made the decision for her.
 I swung the door open and slipped out of the car before she could respond.
 I waved goodbye with a cheery casualness I thought did a pretty good job of hiding my desire to break into tears.

I still like the lyrics: I still imagine a face white like faith’s hue and a dimple carved there and a disdain for any attention.
 How attractive these qualities are.
 How they still reverberate across the gulf of time.
 It really is a gulf, deep like an ode, and dark as if dipped in death-shadow.
 CM: 	Damn.
 It’s a beautiful melody, too.
 BG:  	Yeah it is.
 And that’s sitar on it—though we miked it so it sounds sort of like a harp.
 CM: 	Ok.  “Building Cla-Le-Clare?”
 BG:  	You know, Larry co-wrote that.

The rest of me just nodded calmly, and turned to head upstairs as Isaac politely passed me, apparently on his way to the kitchen.
 Alec gently grasped my shoulder before I'd even managed to take a step.
 "There isn't time.
 We have to go now."
 As soon as we were out the front door, Alec motioned for me to jump on his back, and then we were off with a speed I suspected an Olympic athlete couldn't have matched.
 The lane between our house and the road flew by faster than I'd ever driven it in a car.
 The wind created by our passage was strong enough to make my eyes tear up, but I resisted the urge to close them.
 I occasionally saw shadowy shapes darting through the trees ahead or to either side of us, but there wasn't any way to be sure it was Isaac and Jasmin instead of Brandon and his entire pack.
 A faint howl from behind us caused Alec to put on another terrifying burst of speed as we left the lane and turned to parallel the road.
 The sight of branches clawing at us as we slipped by them with little more than inches to spare was too much.

I could feel the edge, razor sharp, cleanly parting some of the layers of gauze that'd been wrapped around my emotions.
 It didn't make sense.
 Alec was barely even civil.
 He most definitely wasn't part of the support structure that'd been holding my world in its normal orbit, but suddenly my defenses were in danger of being breached.
 He looked up disinterestedly as I sat in my desk, and even that was enough to send little shivers of near pain coursing through my system.
 It wasn't real pain; I was still too cushioned from the world for that, but my body shied away from it just the same.
 I wanted to run screaming from the room, to jump through a window, to do anything to avoid coming into further contact with someone who so obviously hated me.
 The urges were all very real, but it was like I'd been drugged to the gills.
 I couldn't gather the energy to do anything about them.
 Instead my mind reached down and pulled extra layers of gauze over itself.

But contrary to popular conception and empirical observation, there is little evidence to support the thesis that technological development is responsible for rising levels of unemployment in the medium to long term.
 In spite of widespread anxiety that machines are progressively replacing people in the workforce, historically there has been a strong positive correlation between technological development and job creation.
 It is certainly the case that the commercial application of each new phase of productive technologies displaces people from traditional occupations, reduces the number of workers required to carry out specific tasks, and can in the short term lead to fewer jobs in specific industries.
 In the process, a larger number of low-wage, unskilled jobs are replaced with a smaller number of higher-wage, more skilled jobs resulting in rising levels of worker productivity and rising personal incomes.
 But that is only the most direct initial impact of improved technology.
 Seen from a wider perspective and traced patiently along the course of its myriad consequences, the introduction of new technology acts as a catalyst that generates a positive ripple effect which, on average, results in the creation of many more jobs – more skilled, more productive and higher-wage jobs – than it destroys.
 The rising productivity made possible by technology reduces production costs and thereby lowers the price of products and services to customers and consumers.
 The lower prices result in increased demand, greater consumption, higher levels of production and even greater cost reductions due to economies of scale.
 This represents only the first cycle of job creation.
 While jobs are being eliminated in low-skilled manual or assembly operations, simultaneously they are being created in industries that manufacture and service the more sophisticated machines, as well as in Research and Development (R &D) laboratories that develop the new machines, materials and manufacturing processes.

Since Bob is a masterful cook, I eat too much, turn in and worry about Zoë, as she sounded weary and glum when I called her earlier.
 The next morning is sunny, the only dry day I will see while in Portland, according to the weather report.
 So Bob and I head out for a day of whacking golf balls into the marshes beneath some snowcapped peaks across the Columbia River in Washington.
 Because Portland’s main attractions are its brewery pubs, after golf we stop at one of them.
 On two of the too many televisions is the women’s college softball World Series.
 I watch the pitchers, studying their moves.
 Zoë is a softball pitcher too.
 She was the ace of her eight and under team.
 The season just ended a few weeks ago.
 For a project in her second grade class, she wrote and illustrated a book, which her teacher bound, entitled The Fast Friendly Pitcher’s Bad Remembering Day.

“No, I'm not that kind of cold.” She put the little flame out.
 “Ah, I know what you mean,” she said and hugged me.
 “I'm feeling the same way.
 But don't worry, they,” she motioned to the boys, “don't have to know.” “They'll find out eventually,” I mumbled.
 “But that doesn't have to been now.
 I bet they must have some kind of fear themselves.” I shivered.
 “It's like going throw the bogey-man's home.” “He must not get a lot of visitors,” Emily commented.
 “I'm defiantly not coming over anytime soon.” Emily laughed and the boys stopped walking.
 The trees parted to reveal a rock ledge.
 I spotted a small cave, the entrance covered in thick, twisted bramble.

He checked the powders for magic and several came off very strong so he added them to the pile.
 Two came off with the foulest feel yet, even worse than the books in the studio.
 He could not burn them but knocked them into the middle of the room and then added a couple of the other non-magic powder containers.
 In his final action before he left, he used the crow bar to shatter all the bottles, and made sure to mix the powders together.
 He hopes that would make them impossible to use.
 After moving what he wanted to take with him to his pile at the entrance, he headed down the stairs to the dungeon.
 Rodregas did not want to go down there.
 Some of his worst memories were from his time down in the dungeon.
 Too many terrible deeds had occurred there, not that he had done many of them himself, but he had not been able to stop them.
 He could have tried to stop the terrible things that had happened, but he had simply chosen to survive instead.

"Why?"
 When he didn't answer, she took his hand, lacing her fingers with his.
 "They tried to make a game of picking me up and throwing me into the waves, but I wouldn't let them.
 I didn't let them touch me.
 Not even to help me up."
 She played with a damp, curling lock of his hair.
 "I'm still a woman of the '20s.
 I don't let men hold my hand or embrace me or touch me in any way .

The half-orc swung his glowing black blades, cutting his bow, and his body, in twain.
 As the blood poured free, he roared, looked about, and then ran off toward the sound of combat.
 A frail form in rags followed from inside the house, a mirror image in looks but for the paler skin and lack of muscle.
 “You saw nothing,” this second half-orc said to him before following the warrior.
 Antonil struggled to his feet, shaking his head all the while.
 “It keeps getting stranger,” he muttered.
 He took a step and immediately regretted it.
 As his leg throbbed, he yanked the arrow out.
 His armor had kept it from penetrating too deeply, the barbs unable to latch onto any soft flesh.
 Of course it still hurt like the abyss, but he could deal with that.

“I was a half-ling.,” June corrected me.
 “I’m dead now.
 But I can still speak to you because you have to complete the job I did before with my friends.” “Wow, back up a second,” I said quickly.
 “You’re dead?” She tapped her foot impatiently.
 “Do you know how long ago I defeated Kojas?
 It must have been over one hundred years ago.” “Wow, that was a long time ago,” I said.
 “You defeated Kojas?” June sighed in frustration.
 “Did you pay any attention to anything?
 Mackenzie, David, Mark and I beat Kojas the first time he appeared.
 It wasn’t easy; let me tell you that right now.” “How did you die?” “Mark died of a wound after we beat Kojas.

How do you propose to handle yet another set of homework?"
 I felt my mouth slam shut.
 He knew everything about everyone, but it still somehow caught me by surprise that he knew so much about me.
 "But they'll hate me even more."
 I already wished I could take it back, but it was too late.
 It took less than half a second for him to figure out who I was talking about.
 "They don't hate you.
 A few of them are scared almost senseless, but nobody hates you."
 "They were willing to kill me.
 They wanted to trade me back to Brandon."

Words spilled from the frail half-orc’s lips.
 Some were strong, demanding, while others came limping out, twisted in form and barely existing as they were meant to exist.
 The words, however, did not matter as much as the dark power rolling forth from Qurrah.
 His sheer will would determine the full strength of the spell.
 A cold wind came blasting in, seemingly from all directions.
 Faster and faster, the words poured from Qurrah’s pale lips.
 Harruq braced himself as his hair fluttered before his eyes.
 The spell neared completion, and Velixar hissed in sheer pleasure at the power flaring from his apprentice.
 Qurrah shrieked out one final word, the signal, the climax of the spell.
 “ _Rise!_ ”

The half-orc smiled at the name.
 “It even looks all pretty,” he said, eliciting a laugh.
 “Do Qurrah now.”
 Aurelia did not begin writing immediately, instead thinking over the pronunciation.
 “Qurrah,” she said at last.
 “It is a little tricky, but I bet it is spelled like this.”
 Letter by letter she wrote ‘Qurrah’ in the dirt.
 Harruq stared at it, whispering his brother’s name as his eyes traced the letters.
 As he did, a thought hit him.
 His eyes went back and forth from his own name and Qurrah’s.

It really isn't any trouble.
 James, can you get your car, please?"
 He looked angry.
 Like maybe he was going to argue, but as he opened his mouth Rachel turned and glared at him.
 It seemed odd to see someone only a little smaller than Alec back away from someone even smaller than me.
 The image stuck with me so strongly that I considered it until Rachel came over and took my hand.
 "What's wrong?
 It's just the two of us now, you don't have to worry about James, and I won't tell anyone else.
 I swear."
 Rachel's promise somehow seemed like it belonged from another time.

 "Let's find something funny to watch."
 They found an "I Love Lucy" rerun, but for once Marie couldn't pay attention to the television.
 Rick was sitting back in the corner of the sofa, and she was leaning against him with his arm around her.
 How could she be so comfortable with a man after only a week?
 They always sat like this now, and they frequently embraced during the day.
 And she loved it.
 She didn't have to trick him into holding her, didn't have to dance with him to get his arms around her.
 He liked holding her.

Prison.
 I pushed the book into my pack and finally slept.
 When I woke, I felt better.
 Stronger.
 I was hopeful this applied to my magic as well.
 Chevelle sat against the dark stone wall, watching me.
 He seemed to recognize the change in my mood.
 “Feeling well?” I nodded.
 “I think I’d like to train again.” “That is probably a good idea.
 We’ll be leaving soon.” I didn’t know if I was that much better.

"Are we here?"
 "Disappointed?"
 I felt my skin heat up again, but managed to stick my tongue out.
 "No, we're not quite there yet, but before we continue on, I need your promise not to discuss this with anyone.
 Not even the rest of the pack."
 I was taken aback with his sudden intensity, and part of me wanted to bristle at the implication I couldn't be trusted with a secret.
 His expression softened a little as he reached into the small bag mounted on the fuel tank, and handed me a bottle of water.
 I hadn't even realized I was thirsty until that second.
 "I'm sorry, Adriana.
 I know I can depend on you, this is just important enough that I needed to make sure you understood what's riding on your discretion."

 "She'll come after me."
 Brandon shook his head.
 "I won't let her.
 That's part of why I wanted to talk to you.
 I won't let anyone do anything to you.
 Think of it as repayment."
 The words weren't anything special, but there was something about the way he said them that made me absolutely sure he'd deliver on his promise, that he was somehow completely in control of his surroundings.
 The intensity in his stare was too much, and I found myself looking away, trying to buy some time to collect myself.
 Luckily I wasn't so far gone as to not recognize where we were.

She tore off the paper and stared at a rectangular gadget with several buttons and what looked like a small TV screen.
 "What is this?"
 "A Gameboy.
 You can play different games on it.
 I bought you four."
 He opened a bag and took out four small cartridges.
 Marie watched as Rick made bricks of different shapes fit together, laughing when he got stuck in a pattern and all the bricks piled up to the top.
 "Let me try."
 The bricks piled up as she tried to manipulate the buttons.
 But by the time she began her third game, she'd mastered them, and she got over 5000 points.

Rodregas spoke carefully so as not to tip the sword and said, “It is called sword meditation.
 My instructor would start us out with the prayer and then we would meditative on our duty.” “For how long?” asked Imeralda.
 “Until you are sure of what your duty is,” Rodregas replied, hearing the voice of his old drill Knight Captain.
 All the instructors had been retired knights who enjoyed teaching the squires.
 He did not think the two would join him for this but both pulled their weapons and imitated his position, Doi’van with his large great sword balanced on his powerful arms, Imeralda grabbed her bow instead of a short sword, which with her lack of training was probably a good idea.
 Rodregas focused inwards and resumed his meditation.
 He was finding it wonderful to do the meditation again; Rodregas had a lot of good memories from his life as a squire, before everything had gone wrong.
 Part of him felt uncomfortable for doing this again, like he no longer had the right.
 But once you are raised from Page to Squire as he had been, you always got to keep the title of Squire.
 Squires who were not raised to knighthood were much sought after; their martial training and their education, especially in law and etiquette, were a great foundation for many careers.

BG: 	Lately, for whatever reasons, I have been thinking more about the spiritual side of the human animal than ever I have in my previous twenty-some year tenure on Spaceship Earth.
 It probably has to do with getting older, finding my stability in Lor.
 Time at least to take a peak into the spiritual caldron.
 There are miracles, it might cause one to whisper, alone in the dark.
 I’m not comfortable, really, man, talking about my numinous side, as interesting as I think that is.
 I want to ask a lot of questions, without presuming there are always answers.
 Like, where do lares and penates, where does religion, fit in with this cynical lifestyle we’ve adopted, or that we’ve carefully constructed?
 As The Lovin’ Spoonful asked, “Do you believe in magic?” I mean, I don’t know what has caused me to cogitate about the underlying premise of life, you know?.
 I mean, fuck, are we really that far removed from our supranatural sides that any discussion or mention of it is inordinate, is worth commentary?
 Or are we only embarrassed by discussions of spirituality?

I took a deep breath and started to enter the cave.
 All of a sudden, a roar made me freeze.
 Two nostrils and eyes popped up from the cave.
 My blood stopped.
 It was a dragon.
 Chapter 8
 I stood, frozen in fear at the sight of the dragon.
 It stalked towards me.
 The piercing green eyes bore into mine and I was more scared than I had ever been in all 15 years of my life.
 “Jazell move!” Seth yelled and pushed me behind him so hard, I almost fell over.

ICPF refused to side with the pessimists who viewed unemployment as a terminal illness spreading rapidly through the entire world economic system.
 Its report presented evidence to dispel the twin myths that technological development and trade were net job destroyers.
 It traced the growth of employment opportunities through the 20th Century, a century of unprecedented technological development and commercial expansion, to show that this period has also been an era of unprecedented growth in the quantity and quality of employment opportunities.
 The report argued that the current surge in joblessness was a temporary result of the mismatch between the rates of surging population growth and expanding economic activity.
 It concurred that rising levels of unemployment constituted a serious problem that needed to be urgently addressed, but rejected the notion that it is an inevitable and incurable disease which the world must resign itself to passively suffer and endure.
 The Commission, therefore, developed and presented a comprehensive strategy for job-led economic growth.
 Over the past decade, changes in the employment picture lend credence to ICPF’s perspective.
 The American economy experienced a decade-long expansion, fuelling high levels of employment at home, while stimulating job growth throughout East Asia, attracting a massive influx of foreign technical workers and setting the stage for a global outsourcing boom which is still in its infancy.
 Among the advanced economies, unemployment declined from an average of 6.9 per cent in the period 1985-94 to 6.5 per cent during the last 10 years.
 It fell by 10 per cent in France, 25 per cent in Italy, a third in Netherlands, 50 per cent in Spain and 70 per cent in Ireland.

Tilting her chin up, he smiled at her.
 "You're beautiful, Marie."
 She caught her breath, unable to respond.
 To her delight, she saw that he was going to kiss her.
 She closed her eyes, savoring the anticipation and then the sweetness of his lips on hers.
 When, after a few seconds, he didn't end the kiss, her heartbeat sped up.
 He'd never kissed her this long before.
 But her eyes flew open when she felt his hand slide under her skirt to squeeze her thigh.
 Panicking, she tried to push him away.
 But he pinned her against the back of the sofa, his mouth becoming rough.

The governments of the region have been so preoccupied with ‘re-engineering’ their economic and political systems and with meeting the conditions to attract foreign aid and investment that they have tended to over look the many essential and practical steps needed to implement the reforms on the ground.
 Even if governments had been able to get all the laws and economic policies ‘right’ the first time, there is no assurance that the actual impact on the people would have been less harsh than it has been.
 The so-called ‘shock therapy’ strategy pursued by these countries has been widely criticized for its severity and seeming indifference to social costs.
 But debates regarding the appropriate speed and social cost of reforms divert attention from a more fundamental problem with this approach.
 The essence of shock therapy is a reliance on macro-economic factors to bring about a radical restructuring of the economy and a radical change in the behaviour of individuals and enterprises.
 While monetary policy may prove useful for dealing with short-term adjustment problems within a relatively stable environment, there is no evidence to support its use as the principle instrument for social transition.
 Monetary variables are indicators of the functioning of an economy, but the essential factors which determine the strength and health of an economy are the productivity of its enterprises and its workforce and the material resources of the country.
 Tight monetary policy can generate intense short-term pressure for change in behaviour, but this pressure is applied indiscriminately and often with unexpected and unanticipated results.
 The primary result of premature liberalization of prices was to encourage trade and speculation while discouraging production and investment.
 It distracted attention from fundamental changes in institutions and social attitudes needed for the transition to be successful.

“What do we do about all the blood?” he asked.
 “We will clean it, but first we must drain the body.”
 The two dug through dressers upstairs, grabbing old and expensive robes and shirts.
 They then dragged the body outside to where the deceased elf had kept a private garden.
 Thick brick walls guarded against any prying eyes.
 They dug a large hole in a corner and then bled the body dry, letting the fluids soak into the dirt.
 Occasionally, they would halt and listen, worried their violent struggle had reached unwanted ears.
 No curious investigators arrived, however, and they continued with their dark deed.
 When the blood dripping from the elf’s wounds became but a trickle, they filled the hole and moved on.
 Using the clothes and robes from upstairs, the two brothers wiped away as much of Ahrqur’s blood as they could.

 The two brothers lived in the poorest part of town, sheltered in an old building long abandoned.
 When they had first arrived, several homeless men claimed it as their own.
 Harruq had slit their throats when they slept and then Qurrah worked his art.
 The few vagabonds left in the city quickly learned to avoid the worn building marked by holes in its roof and long shadows that lingered no matter where the sun shone.
 Harruq shoved open the door and then halted as he breathed in the stuffy air.
 “Nothing like home, eh?” he said.
 “Move, before the meat spoils,” Qurrah said.
 The big half-orc stepped out of the way.

It would have been like putting your finger in a dike, with the Great Mississippi behind it.
 And I even wrote a couple numbers, crude things, but I still remember ‘em, I can still play ‘em.
 “Caterpillar Blues.” “The Bookseller’s Beautiful Daughter.” “Idlewild Playground Blues.” (laughs) It was all a gas.
 In a way, man, that was my best period as a musician, when I was a sprout, playing my little man blues, all alone, without a care in the world except to make music.
 And have it remake me.
 CM:  	What do you mean?
 BG:  	Well, I was a weeny kid, you know?
 There was only one thing you could be when a boy in that decade and that was tough.
 Everything else was weeny.
 I wasn’t tough.

"The fact that your injury was less severe is really quite immaterial.
 Even the fact that shape shifter-inflicted wounds don't heal as quickly as normal for me is really a small matter when compared to just how much blood you lost before we got the bleeding staunched."
 And there was the real rub.
 Alec was well on his way to being fully healed, while I still had fits of dizziness every time I tried to stand.
 I even had to have Jasmin or Dom help me to the bathroom.
 There was no good way to know how long I'd lain there with a branch stuck through my back, but it'd been long enough for even a relatively small wound to result in near fatal blood loss.
 I'd been nearly unconscious from the pain, so I didn't remember any of what had happened next, but Alec had reluctantly filled in most of the details.
 Apparently the stress of the fight had finally awakened his potential, and his power was a real humdinger.
 The metaphysical hurricane that'd knocked me to the ground had actually been Alec pulling power from all of the shape shifters and humans in the area.
 The experience had been nearly as overwhelming for Alec as it had been for the rest of us.

Stupid dust.
 I watched Chevelle’s face as my eyes fluttered shut, exhausted.
 My dreams brought him close, a much-too-vivid kiss on the cheek that burned like fire.
 My skin was blistering, I could feel the color.
 It swirled around me and shocked me awake again.
 I lay on the floor, eyes wide, body unmoving.
 I was weak, tired, still under the influence, but I heard voices.
 I didn’t move as I listened to discern if they were real.
 They seemed to be close, but muffled—maybe in the next room or down a corridor—as they echoed off the stones.
 I thought I’d picked out Anvil’s deep voice.

The goals and strategies recommended in this report aim to accelerate the process of political, social and economic development by creating greater public awareness of desirable and achievable objectives and releasing the initiative of individuals and institutions to pursue them more vigorously.
 Information is the most powerful catalyst for this process.
 The speed and extent of knowledge transfer are far from optimal between and within nations – even within industrially advanced nations – due to lack of information, out-dated attitudes and beliefs, lingering superstitions, and conventional wisdom.
 Ignorance and scepticism about new opportunities are characteristic of development at each stage and in every field of activity.
 Information about success stories helps overcome this resistance and spurs people to action.
 Enormous potentials are waiting to catch the attention of the society and take off at this moment.
 Proven technology exists in many fields that await application because people do not know or do not believe that it can be employed successfully.
 Imitation of intensive aquaculture methods commonly employed by farmers in Taiwan and Singapore can raise average fish yields in South Asian, African and Latin American countries 25-fold.
 Advanced methods for micro-nutrient management can double or quadruple fruit and vegetable yields in most developing countries.
 A complete list of proven but untapped technologies and commercial opportunities should be compiled for each country, each region and local area.

Anger swelled inside, and when he looked to Aurelia he felt an enormous desire to attack.
 She was questioning his master, his brother, questioning what it meant to be him.
 When he opened his eyes, Aurelia stood, shocked by the red light wafting like smoke from Harruq’s eyes.
 “You could never know what I am,” he said.
 “I’ve seen what you can be,” she said.
 “Is that not enough?”
 The words stung him.
 His vision swam crimson.
 He felt his hands close upon his swords.
 Perhaps he shouldn’t have saved her.

"I'm sorry to have pried like that.
 If I'd known it would make you feel bad, I wouldn't have asked."
 I tried to shrug indifferently, but she seemed to see through my pretenses.
 "I normally wouldn't have said anything, but knowing what I know now, I wouldn't want you to go through the next several days hurting inside because you think everyone looking at you out of the corner of their eye is ridiculing you."
 Confident she didn't really need help, and eager to avoid further reminders of just how broken I was, I'd been standing to return to my desk.
 The words were plenty foreboding, but they had an impact all out of proportion from what they should have.
 I sank back into the chair and turned towards Rachel.
 Not enough to actually make eye contact with her, just enough I hopefully didn't come off rude.
 Maybe the illusion of space would be enough to cushion me from whatever she was going to say next.
 Rachel waited a second, giving me a chance to say something before she proceeded.

Of course Albert did stop by to see if I was having any difficulties, but since I didn't summon him, he couldn't read anything into it.
 When Britney stomped over and asked if I was done, I considered telling her I needed ten more minutes.
 Her being an attention hog didn't justify me being petty though.
 I just nodded instead and packed up my stuff.
 The ride home was completely uneventful, and mercifully brief.
 Britney was one of those people who drive fast normally, and even faster when they are pissed off.
 Apparently having to stay after school to study merited twenty-five over the speed limit.
 I normally would have complained--I'd become much more sensitive about speeding in the last couple of months, but I was anxious to get home, and very much not feeling like there was anything particularly special to live for.
 Not that I was suicidal, contrary to Mom's unvoiced, but obvious fears.
 I just didn't have much of anything to look forward to.

Everything suddenly dropped into place, and I grabbed Brandon's arm.
 "Who's that?"
 Brandon tensed up for a second, and then his massive arm relaxed under my hand as he followed my gaze.
 "That's Ben."
 His voice dropped to a rumbling whisper.
 "The one I told you about the other day."
 It was incredibly obvious, all the while making absolutely no sense.
 He was obviously uncomfortable this morning, just like you'd expect from someone who was in the unenviable position of telling off a borderline psychopath.
 Everything I'd seen substantiated Brandon's explanation, but why would Jasmin become so enamored of someone so average-looking?
 Not only that, what were the odds Ben was one of the eight males in America who would decide they weren't interested in dating the most gorgeous girl on the planet, even if she was a nut case?

It was a good thing Alec had such a steady arm, it was all I could do not to stumble as I took in the transformation that'd taken place.
 Our group glided up to the covered pavilion, surrounded in a pocket of silence as the rest of the crowd turned to see who'd just arrived.
 Alec produced tickets for all of us from a pocket somewhere while I was still taking in the sheer number of lights that'd been assembled for the occasion.
 The decorations inside the pavilion were amazing.
 Swathes of silk gave the open-air building an ethereal feel, while candles and other light sources created a soft illumination.
 I didn't have to possess preternatural hearing to catch whispers about the city having received a very large, very anonymous donation just a few days before.
 The committee had obviously chosen to spend it on decorations.
 My newfound height put me closer to Alec's ear.
 I only had to tug on his arm a little bit to get him down to where I could whisper to him.
 "That was you, wasn't it?"

Hardwood bows rested high on their backs.
 The wolves were mostly concealed on the ground, vigilant.
 One glanced up at me, at the bird.
 Someone approaching, robe and tassels blowing in the cool breeze.
 The second wolf looked forward.
 He saw it, too, and abruptly pointed, calling out.
 But the howl echoed in my own ears, not my imagination, and I jolted upright.
 The field was in motion, rushing in response to the warning.
 In seconds, they were set again, the same protective positions they had taken the last time.
 The last time a tracker had found us.

 "Why were you kidnapped?

 "I don't know.
 Um, Mother, could we have some cocoa?"
 Mrs. Tranton hugged her daughter.

 "You really miss her."
 "Yes.
 There have been times in the last five weeks when I really needed her.
 Needed to talk to her."
 "When you get back, what are you going to talk to her about?"
 "You."
 Fresh tears ran down her cheeks.
 He tilted her chin up, wiping away her tears.
 "Won't you consider staying here with me?

“I take it you know him?” he asked.
 “He’s following me,” I announced, too loud.
 His eyes were concerned, so I let down my guard, moving to stand behind him.
 Chevelle approached us, staring directly at me as if there were not the broad, tall form of the stranger between us.
 He let me see his irritation for one long moment before his features melted back into their standard sternness.
 For some reason, it infuriated me, and I nearly berated him right there.
 But I remembered I was on the run.
 I remembered this strange elf in front of me.
 I decided to keep my mouth shut before I dug a deeper hole.
 An arm wrapped around my shoulder and drew me forward.

For the first time all day I felt like I could relax.
 The few times I looked up, I saw Britney, who seemed determined not to give in and actually do her homework.
 I finished my two assignments about the time I normally did, and walked over to where Mrs. Campbell was trying to explain a story problem.
 The sophomore she was helping looked like he wanted to be anywhere other than trying to figure out how long it would take Sally to mow the lawn given a certain width of lawn mower moving at a given rate of speed.
 "Oh, Adriana.
 Go ahead and walk around looking for students who need help.
 Most everyone will leave in the next ten minutes or so, but we're actually open for another hour."
 She was right.
 Nearly everyone left over the next little while as they either finished up their assignments, gave up, or finally filled whatever quota of study time they'd been given by their parents.
 I did get to answer a couple of questions, which was surprisingly fun.

Even though I knew I wouldn't remember the void when I finally came to, I wanted nothing more than to just float in the darkness.
 It had been a hard day.
 I'd....actually I wasn't sure why it'd been a hard day, but something told me I'd unconsciously been at the end of my rope just before I'd collapsed.
 Unfortunately that same thing told me I couldn't dwell here in the comforting absence, there was a very important reason for me to regain my feet.
 The void was reluctant to let me go, stripping me of memories and experiences as I fought my way free.
 By the time I was near surfacing I no longer remembered just how much I'd wanted to stay.
 Britney was pacing back and forth when I opened my eyes.
 She had her cell phone out and was looking like she wanted to dial 911, but was worried about the possible fallout.
 I was on the ground, which for some reason made me more irritable than it should have.
 Didn't she realize how hard it was to make it over to someone before collapsing like that?

You are nothing but pretenders.”
 Harruq clanged his swords together, showering the ground with sparks.
 His armor shimmered as his anger grew.
 “Pretenders with wonderful toys,” the elf continued, eyeing Harruq’s blades.
 “Toys I will take from your dead bodies.”
 He leapt down the stairs in a single bound.
 His feet hardly touched before he was vaulting over a red silk couch to land before the fireplace.
 He drew an ornate sword that hung over the fireplace, letting the scabbard fall to the floor.
 The blade gleamed in the firelight, impossibly sharp and deadly.
 “I have killed a hundred like you,” Ahrqur said.

In both industrial and developing countries, workers may be in surplus, but the skills needed are in deficit.
 In the most prosperous nations, the deficit is concentrated in high technology and professional sectors, in electronics, biotechnology, health care, pharmacology, mathematics, marketing, financial services, and the like.
 The adoption of new technologies even in traditional occupations has resulted in a growing demand for higher skill levels in these fields as well.
 Unemployment is highest among the least educated, least skilled categories, such as machine operators, fabricators and labourers.
 The poor are poor both because they have no assets and because their time and labour have low or no economic value.
 Poverty persists wherever the human resource is under-valued.
 To eradicate it, there is need for a paradigm shift from unskilled to skilled work.
 While educated unemployment is high in many developing countries, in most cases the quality and relevance of the education to employment opportunities is far from adequate.
 Here too, fully qualified technical and professional workers are in short supply.
 There is even a shortage for educated workers with a high level of general language and communication skills to fill the job opportunities being created for business process outsourcing.

 He shuddered.
 "Are you sure you're feeling all right?"
 Marie asked him, having seen his shudder.
 "Maybe you had too much sun this weekend."
 She leaned over to feel his forehead.
 "Hmmm.
 You may have a slight fever.
 I'm going to get you some aspirin and juice."
 He watched her go.

Bandits, or worse.
 The orcs have struck Veldaren once.
 They may well have found a way across the bone ditch again.”
 “Hard to rest with torchlight flickering into your bedroom,” said an elderly man behind Jeremiah.
 “Something ain’t right, Corren,” Jeremiah said, “and I’d bet all my harvest you feel it stronger than we do.”
 Corren stroked his beard as his eyes went blank.
 “Two men come from the east,” he said, his voice distant.
 “But they are not men.
 Troubled spirits, half-demons…”
 The two farmers stared at Corren in horror as the old man’s voice returned to normal.

She went to her room and put on a set of black lace underwear and a set of emerald on top of that.
 Now that she knew Rick was the key to opening the door, she wasn’t worried that clothing from 2011 would keep her from getting back.
 She wanted to wear the black dress they'd bought for their trip to Hollywood, but she put on her Egyptian-motif dress, not wanting to shock her parents.
 She tucked Rick's handkerchief into her bra--bras--and then put on the silver bracelet he'd bought her in Tijuana.
 Finally she took Davis' betrothal ring from the little porcelain dish where it had lain since the night she'd realized she couldn't marry him.
 In a few hours she'd take it off and hand it to him.
 Rick was outside her door when she opened it.
 He handed her a paper grocery bag, telling her, "This bag is kind of big, but all the others are plastic and have `Walmart' written on them."
 "Thank you."
 They went downstairs hand in hand.

 Jim – See you at the show.

 Scene 2
 Later that day.
 An art gallery.
 Several pedestals with ‘art’, one being a cardboard box supposedly filled with ceramic pieces.
 And several paintings are on display.
 The art work all has spotlights on it, in addition to the regular lighting.
 Several people are looking at the creations and acting like they are holding conversations as they move about and look at the exhibit.

He wondered what radio programs she’d enjoyed and if maybe she’d preferred to read.
 Sighing, Rick rose to go inside.
 He didn’t feel like being alone all day.
 Maybe he’d call Dirk and go play racquetball.
 Or maybe— He stopped and turned around, hearing footsteps.
 Footsteps?
 Who would be out here?
 A neighbor's child, maybe?
 He decided to investigate, although the fog made it difficult.
 To his knowledge, no children had ever come here, but he wanted to be sure that no one was trampling the flowers.

Her morals were deeply ingrained, and the guilt would eat away at her.
 He loved her far too much to put her through that.
 But they couldn't go on like this.
 He'd always prided himself on his self-control, but living under the same roof with a woman he loved, a woman who begged for his kisses--that was too much.
 But he knew Marie didn't really understand.
 She thought that they could just kiss forever.
 If only he could convince her to stay here with him.
 He was sure that she'd eventually come to accept the fact that she wasn't going to be able to get back home, but he was afraid they'd end up making love before she'd reached that point.
 And while making love on their wedding night would be a wonderful, earth-shattering experience for them both, he knew that making love before marriage would probably have disastrous results for her--and therefore for him.
 So he had to convince her to stay.

She finally made a shooing motion and turned back to grading papers.
 Predictably, there were still a half-dozen other kids in the classroom.
 They all turned back to the door and started filing out again, but by tomorrow half the school would know exactly how badly I'd just been humiliated.
 I found myself just outside the tutor lab with no recollection of having stumbled to my locker, or going by Physics to grab the stuff I'd left there.
 Still, somehow my Spanish book had disappeared, replaced by my math book.
 My knees started shaking as I entered the room, but I made it safely to my normal table before they gave out.
 "Adri, Adriana?
 Excuse me."
 I didn't recognize the girl standing across from me, but based on her uncomfortable expression and the fact that more than one person had turned for the sole purpose of watching us out of the corner of their eyes, she'd been standing there longer than I'd realized.
 Apparently my looking up was enough of a response for her to proceed.

At the same time, there is no longer an insurmountable political conflict within the UN system to prevent all member countries from agreeing to a total ban on the use of violence against each other.
 It is time for the UN to declare war itself a crime against humanity and to ban from membership any nation that engages in aggression against another.
 Even if this intention cannot immediately be made effective, the adoption of this Peace Imperative would mark a milestone in human affairs.
 There is no rational or practical obstacle to the immediate adoption of this measure.
 As a starting point, it can be demonstrated that with the right perspective, courage and commitment, practical immediate solutions are possible for any and all of the conflicts presently raging.
 Recent failures of international diplomacy do not contradict this assertion, they confirm it.
 War must, and can, be abolished.
 Nuclear Weapons
 The threats to future peace come in many forms and at many levels, but unquestionably the most pernicious and potentially devastating is the peril from nuclear weapons.
 The end of the nuclear arms race between the superpowers may have removed the looming fear of all-out nuclear war and annihilation that surfaced in the artistic drawings of young American school children in the mid-1980s, but the horrible genie of Hiroshima and Nagasaki will continue to haunt us until every nuclear weapon has been destroyed.

A whisper roused me from my studies and I realized it was late, so I decided to give up and start again the next day.
 Rising unsteadily, I heard the whisper again.
 But it wasn’t a whisper—it was the wind.
 I glanced backward.
 Paper fell to scatter on the floor.
 I surveyed the library, but it was practically empty.
 Someone on a higher level must have knocked the pages down.
 I bent over and read the closest document.
 It was an account from the northern clans.
 Despite my disbelief, I somehow managed to act quickly, stashing the papers in my shirt before attempting a casual exit to read them at home.

Chevelle’s horse whinnied as they rode away.
 “Why always the face?” I yelled at his back.
 I winced as a second branch, this one young and green and more like a lash, struck me from behind.
 A fierce growl escaped me and I took off, running at full speed in the direction my horse had gone.
 By midday, I was completely spent.
 I had eventually caught my horse, but the training hadn’t let up.
 I was too exhausted for any anger to remain, but I had the sneaking suspicion Chevelle was enjoying my “lessons.” We stopped by a patch of snow that had gathered in a rock basin, warming it to water for the horses.
 Chevelle jumped down from his horse as I melted off the side of mine and onto a rock, my limbs like molasses.
 He came to sit across from me and I flinched, expecting another attack.
 He smiled.

I collapsed onto all fours, hardly noticing the burning pain from my damaged palms, and let the racking sobs take over.
 I probably would've stayed there all night if not for the howling.
 It'd been going for several seconds before it pulled me back from the mental abyss I'd been so eagerly approaching.
 I looked around blankly for several more heartbeats before I finally managed to place the noise.
 Wolves.
 There weren't supposed to be any wolves in the area, but there wasn't any ignoring my ears.
 I numbly pulled myself back up, and began stumbling back towards the party, only to stop as another howl echoed down through the canyon.
 It was between me and everyone else.
 I turned and started into a shuffling run.
 Maybe the wolf would be attracted to the noise and light.

“Stop yelling my name, Jazell, or you’ll tell the whole world that I’m here.” My arm dropped and I slid the knife back in its sheath.
 I followed Seth through the trees.
 This time there were less of them and the only ones that around us looked half dead.
 The bark was peeling off and I could see the tree branches leaning towards the ground.
 The air was cold and heavy, like a mound of snow on your shoulders.
 The trees parted to show a cliff.
 We walked up to the edge and the wind whipped at my face.
 A feeling of déjà vu came upon me.
 I knew where we were because I had been here before.
 “Seth, I was here in my dream, the one with Kojas and the dwarf,” I said.

Preventive Diplomacy, Peace Making and Peace Building
 The answers to the questions regarding national sovereignty and international responsibility will determine the scope of UN preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace building in years to come.
 They must be addressed with a view to evolving valid principles of international law, rather than remaining subject to frequent reversals of public policy by member states based on the short-term impact of the media on current public opinion.
 Granted that a consensus is reached regarding these larger issues of principle, there still will remain immense problems relating to implementation, as illustrated by the recent failure of international intervention in Somalia.
 Whatever may be the limits placed on the UN’s mandate for action, it is clear that it cannot carry out that mandate effectively under the current constraints imposed on it by member states through indecisiveness, narrowly defined interests and lack of political commitment.
 Once again the inherent weaknesses in the structure of the UN organization impact negatively on its capacity to perform the tasks rightfully allotted to it.
 The absence of a unified chain of command for national forces placed under UN command – culminating in the outright refusal of field forces to follow the commands of UN field staff, inadequate training and equipping of both military staff and fighting units, poor coordination between field units from different countries and between member states and UN headquarters – and a failure to vest sufficient authority in the UN Secretary General are among the most blatant weaknesses of the present system.
 Substantive measures are needed to strengthen the UN’s capabilities to handle crises.
 First and foremost, the position of the Secretary General, who now has the diplomatic status equal to that of a prime minister of a member state, should be upgraded to that of a head of state, with full authority over the forces placed under his command by member states to carry out the decisions of the Security Council.
 Problems of control over the armed forces of member states argue for the constitution of a standing international military force, as described in the previous section of this report.

Rodregas had always thought that it was only Ravenhurr’s eyes that gave away the fact that what was inside him was not as attractive as his exterior.
 Ravenhurr’s eyes had an intensity about them, a habit of weighing everyone else and finding them wanting.
 Rodregas felt that Ravenhurr saw in everyone else a lesser person whose best function was to be used by his betters.
 Rodregas looked over the rooftop following Ravenhurr’s eyes.
 Most of the open flat roof of the tower was covered in various circles.
 The largest circle held all the others and was made of a glittering white sand-like substance.
 Its diameter had been drawn as large as possible within the limitations of the roof’s edges.
 On the inside were sigils, runes, and small candles set out every few feet.
 Rodregas knew enough of magic to understand that the purpose of this circle was to keep out unwanted magical influences.
 They could interfere with the spell casting inside the circle.

Jim – And you did?
 They asked you to stop and you did?
 Why didn’t I think of that?
 Eugene – There were eight large hairy men, and they had knives and clubs.
 I assume you’ve seen movies about bikers.
 Can we get on with the new name now?
 Jim – Ah yes, biker movies, I don’t think you’d have made one of them a good wife anyways.
 Guess asking you to stop wouldn’t work for me after all.
 Liz – I told you that you should start lifting weights, besides you might look cute in a leather jacket.
 Jim – I think it’s easier not to piss large men off, then they have no reason to hurt me, and I have no reason to life weights, so I don’t need large muscles.

The leader of the guards tugged all along Harruq’s face, pulling hair and scratching skin.
 “I’ll be,” he said.
 “It is real.
 No illusion and no disguise.
 You two cretins have god-damned elf blood in you.”
 “You jest,” Qurrah said, hanging back and showing no sign of aggression.
 The soldiers clearly thought Harruq the more dangerous of the two, and he was more than willing to let them continue thinking that.
 “No jest,” the guard said.
 “You two are leaving this city, now.”
 “My things,” Harruq said, his voice coming out as a weak croak.

"Yeah.
 Well, not to the men's restroom.
 But anywhere else."
 She stirred her tea thoughtfully.
 "And it's accepted?
 In 1927, women can go to speakeasies, but not respectable women."
 "We don't have speakeasies like those in the '20s, but if you want to, I'll take you dancing one night.
 To one of the wild places where the kids go if you like--and you'll still be considered respectable."
 They spent the next hour comparing their respective decades.
 She told him all about her favorite stars and pictures.

"I just made you spill yours, it's only fair."
 Brandon nodded at Britney, who stood there with her mouth slightly open, as he walked away.
 After a second or two of both of us staring blankly after Brandon, Britney grabbed me by the hand, the one holding the new, unopened water bottle, and pulled me over to a table in the corner.
 "Oh my gosh, you just poured water all over Brandon Worthingfield the Third.
 And then he talked to you.
 This is so incredible."
 I more or less fell into my seat, staring at my new bottle of water as Britney's chatter poured over me.
 It was pointless to try and pay attention to anything she was saying.
 It was all I could do to remember to nod when she paused and looked at me expectantly.
 Lunch passed all too quickly.

She believes you’ve been in the dark long enough.” “What do you mean?” I questioned.
 “Our real destiny?” “Yes,” he said, a little more relaxed, “it must take place in Igneeria, where you are truly needed.” My brow furrowed in confusion.
 “But wait, aren’t we in Igneeria right now?” The dwarf gave a quick, half-hearted laugh.
 “No miss, you are far from Igneeria.
 You’re in the Half-way, the place between Earth and Igneeria.
 The Half-way can act as a gate, or passage into Earth.
 It seals off the two worlds and if a monster were to make it as far as the Half-way, it would have a truly difficult time completing its journey because it won’t find a way in or out of this place.” “So let me get this straight,” I said slowly, “we’re not in Igneeria right now but some Half-way?” The dwarf nodded, happily.
 “So where’s Igneeria?” The dwarf rubbed his stubby chin.
 “The entrance changes but its current location is in your town.
 That’s how I got here.

I’m here to tell you, you got one person, man.
 When you’re a writer, you got one person.
 As close as I am to Lorelei, when I’m in there, when I’m at the typewriter or guitar or keyboard, I’m all alone, man, a chilling kind of alone, and I’m conscienceless, ruthless.
 You write because you’ve got to man, because it’s your guts that are hurting, your guts that are in need of something.
 And you’re gonna find that thing, even as it keeps receding from view, even as the more you go forward the farther away it gets.
 You ever been to the beach man?
 Seen those little clams, tiny little fuckers, that dive as you dig around them.
 They just keep burrowing downward, and the faster you dig the deeper they go (is that a Beatle’s line?
 something like that) (laughs).
 Anyway, those little fuckers defy your best efforts, they’re almost always gonna be quicker than you.

It didn’t make sense.
 I knew I had been assigned a watcher.
 From the North.
 “No one?” I asked.
 “No.
 Council does not attempt to rule the North.” I considered that, considered my watcher.
 He was a volunteer.
 I seethed for a moment, but flashes of my mother and council cloaks flooded my thoughts and I had to block them.
 “So the North… has no council at all?” His answer was uncomfortable.
 “No.

I knew that the wavy vertical line off the side was destined to become a waterfall.
 The scene was starting to take shape, but for the first time in ages I still couldn't place it.
 A mossy boulder filled itself in with feathery detail, and then I realized the center of the piece was still blank.
 It was like my subconscious hadn't ever seen that part of the landscape.
 Only that didn't make sense.
 How could I not have seen part of whatever it was I was looking at?
 Unless it'd been blocked by something.
 But if so I would have drawn whatever it was that'd been in the foreground.
 I was even worse than normal when it came to drawing people or animals, but I had a good memory for everything else.
 I pushed the notepad away in frustration, and then started shaking as I finally recognized my drawing.

Instead I felt guilty for being given far more credit than I deserved.
 I opened my mouth to object, but was waved back into silence.
 "Obviously I don't want you to make disrupting my class a habit, but that isn't why I wanted to talk to you.
 Your studies are coming along nicely, and I've heard quite a few good things about you from other sources, so I'd like to offer you a job."
 Now that I had a chance to talk, I wasn't sure what to say.
 Nobody had ever wanted to hire me.
 Mrs. Campbell gave me a tired smile.
 "The tutor lab is still understaffed.
 Obviously you couldn't spend your whole afternoon tutoring, as that would negatively affect your efforts to catch up.
 I'm thinking just an hour or so per night.

Johnny – Last time it happened, you burst into tears and ran from the room.
 Jim – No I didn’t!

 Which reminds me, did you ever get the pictures from the Japanese tourists?

 They even wrote a letter.

Moving so smoothly I was positive that nobody else even realized anything was wrong, Alec swung me around so he was between them and me.
 The tension ratcheted up in step with the rolling waves of energy, as Brandon and Vincent drew nearer.
 They split up when they saw us, casually positioning themselves so Alec couldn't protect me from both of them.
 I felt my knees stop working as I took in Brandon's lazy, confident smile, and Vincent's sick, eager expression, but the gentle pressure of Alec's grasp on my hand kept me from falling down.
 I looked up at Alec, hoping for a reassuring smile, but his face had taken on the expressionless mask he used to guard his thoughts.
 I tried to slow down, but Alec kept moving forward, never altering his speed in the slightest as he pulled me directly towards Vincent.
 It seemed incredible that the few other people still in the hall couldn't feel the surge of energy as Vincent stepped directly in front of us and placed his hand on Alec's chest.
 The sudden spike was enough to make my hair stand on end, but Jim Hansen hurried by without any indication there was something out of the ordinary.
 "You're in our way, half-breed."
 I felt Alec's grasp tighten slightly, but considering the crushing strength he was capable of, it was the closest thing imaginable to a non-response.

This must have been the dwarf’s plan.
 Would have been nice if he had warned me, I thought bitterly.
 My dad got up and glowed happily behind my mom.
 “We are very proud, Jazell.
 You’re supposed to leave tomorrow, so you better pack.” “I’m going to go do that.” I said quickly, while I backed up towards the stairs.
 As soon as I reached them, I shot up so fast you would think I was running for my life.
 I closed the door, locking it behind me and then dialed Emily’s cell phone as fast as I could.
 I sat on my bed as the phone rang three times before I heard it click.
 “Jazell you wouldn’t believe what my parents just told me.
 They say I signed up for some camp and-” “I know the same thing happened to me,” I interrupted her quickly.

Rachel and Britney were both in their accustomed places, Rachel studying away as always, and Britney making some weak efforts to do likewise.
 Two of the other three, a boy and a girl I recognized from second hour, but whose names I couldn't even begin to remember, were already packing their books into a pair of book bags, one of which was a fairly utilitarian item, the other of which probably cost as much as my whole wardrobe.
 I couldn't place the last boy for all that he looked really familiar.
 He had incredibly dark skin and features with a slight Middle Eastern cast.
 When he shifted in his seat, I realized he was built like a football player.
 Not like a lineman, but like a running back, or maybe a quarterback.
 He wasn't as big as Brandon, or even as Alec, but he was obviously well muscled, and he moved with an echo of their grace.
 None of which helped me figure out where I'd seen him before.
 He wasn't a regular at the tutor lab, and didn't have the hectic, desperate look of someone cramming for a test.
 Instead he looked completely at ease sitting in one of the no-man's-land tables with a pair of books open in front of him.

Public opinion is an even more important determinant at the international level, since the authority of global institutions is still quite limited.
 Rising ethnic and nationalistic sentiments threaten the integrity of states and impede progress toward regional cooperation and global governance in many countries, because their populations lack reliable information regarding the enormous costs of political and economic fragmentation.
 The global debate over the Uruguay Round of GATT has been obscured by lack of clear information regarding its impact on the countries involved.
 International negotiations on debt, aid and the environment are complicated by lack of awareness about the opportunities that greater economic integration will generate for all nations.
 International institutions, non-governmental agencies and the international media play an important role in providing information to the world community, but there are still huge gaps to be filled in all fields.
 A conscious and systematic effort is required at the international level to put in place both the institutions and the technology for information superhighways needed to support peace, democracy and sustainable development in the twenty-first century.
 Building Social Organization for Development
 The achievement of peace, food security and full employment cannot be accomplished without more fully utilizing one of the most creative and productive of all human resources – organization.
 The march of humanity is marked by the development of larger-scale, more complex and more efficient types of organizations to serve higher and wider social needs.
 Advances in the technology of organization, as much as advances in the technology of production, have been responsible for global progress during the present century and, especially, during the post-war period.

She told him “those things were too good for someone as worthless as him.”  He must have cried for a month afterwards.
 That was just one event.
 She told him that sort of thing all his life, when she wasn’t trying to control all of our lives.
 She ground him into the dirt at every opportunity.
 Liz – How did you and your father get through it when poor Johnny didn’t?
 Jim – Dad spent a lot of time at work.
 There were some weeks when he was working 60 hours or more.
 He always claimed that he was trying to support the family, but after the shop became more and more successful he was making some damn good money.
 He even hired a few other workers to help with the work-load.
 Liz – Dad always thought that he was just a hard worker and a ‘good Christian man’.

She patted my hand as she shrugged.
 "It's rather ironic how things work out sometimes, but that's not fair on my part.
 I'm sure there are things you would much rather learn of than how I came to be in my present circumstances."
 "Actually, that's part of what I want to understand.
 I mean I didn't come here wanting to learn your story specifically, but there's so much history I don't know.
 There's this shared past that I'm not a part of.
 It's like, oh, I don't know, I think maybe learning about the past will help me understand what's going on right now."
 Mallory's sigh seemed to allude to every one of her presumably substantial years.
 "How very perceptive.
 The past is very much driving what's happening right now, but so much of the past is tied up with the very things from which Alec's trying to protect you."

 You didn’t think about lifting your leg to get on the horse, you just knew you wanted to climb on and your leg lifted.” Chevelle caught us then, riding up and cutting off Steed’s explanation with a clipped, “This isn’t the time for a magic lesson.” All three horses slowed to a walk as Chevelle shot Steed a glance.
 I could only think of our lessons, of the fire in the clearing.
 It had been so obvious once Chevelle had urged me to control a stronger flame, I guessed because I had been using the power in small doses for so long.
 “What about your hands?” I asked.
 “What do you mean?” Steed said, ignoring Chevelle’s warning glance.
 “Why do you use your hands, if you just think it, I mean?” He laughed.
 “That’s simply a quirk, I guess.
 Habit.

In order to provide employment for every job seeker, the world needs to create approximately one billion new jobs during the next decade.
 This will require a job growth rate of more than 4 per cent per year compared to the less than 3 per cent achieved during the 1980s.
 About 95 per cent of the growth in the world labour force over the next 35 years will take place in developing countries.
 An additional 260 million people will enter the workforce during the 1990s.
 Employment in the East Asian economies is projected to grow by 37 per cent between 1990 and 2000, while the labour force will increase by only 17 per cent, leading to an increasing shortage of labour in the region.
 In contrast, employment growth is projected to lag behind labour force growth in South Asia, Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa.
 Although job growth has once again started in many OECD countries, economic growth alone will not be sufficient to bring down unemployment rates significantly, especially among youth and the long-term unemployed.
 Changes in values, attitudes, structures and policies will be necessary.
 Unless concerted action steps are taken, global unemployment will increase by 130 million during the 1990s.
 Our thesis is that there is a great deal that can be done to prevent this outcome and even reverse the trend, leading to sharply reduced levels of unemployment and progressive eradication of poverty over the next decade.

So I wrote.
 And, even if we never performed any of it, which we didn’t, they were my songs, and they were popping up on the radio.
 Sebastian did, “Lemmy Caution’s Incubus,” and I think that was really the start of it.
 That was big for him—he has that voice, you know, like he’s sitting next to you, and it perfectly fit the song.
 God bless him—no slouch at writing songs himself, he really took me under his wing, sort of.
 Not much has been made of that connection, but John, early on, taught me the logistics of writing for money, of getting my stuff with one of the music publishers.
 A lot of artists did this, you know, kind of like what Dylan was doing with The Basement Tapes, except that took on a whole life of its own, because it was Bob.
 So, I did some demos, at Ardent with Jim’s help, and others, I just wrote, you know, just committed them to paper and John helped me get them disseminated.
 It worked well then to do that.
 I don’t know if it still does.

Proven methods are available and have been commercially applied with great success, as the achievements of Israel so dramatically demonstrate, radically to reduce water consumption by as much as five- to ten-fold, while at the same time significantly increasing crop yields.
 The most productive of these methods, involving the construction of greenhouses, is too capital-intensive for immediate wide spread adoption in developing countries.
 Drip and sprinkler irrigation are far more moderate in cost and still result in enormous savings of water.
 The cost of adopting these methods can be further reduced by more widely popularizing them, so as to achieve increasing economies of scale in their manufacture.
 8.Low-input sustainable agriculture.
 While we have argued against pressure on food-deficit developing countries to reduce their comparatively low-level usage of mineral fertilizers and chemical pesticides, empirical studies sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences and the Department of Agriculture in the USA found strong evidence, long resisted by scientists and commercial farmers in the West, that chemical-free farming can be as productive and cost-effective as chemical-based methods.
 Industrial countries that offer subsidies to encourage chemical usage should modify their policies to provide active incentives for the use of chemical-free methods instead.
 During the last ten years, Indonesia has succeeded in bringing down the consumption of chemical pesticides without adversely affecting grain production through the nationwide adoption of integrated pest management systems for food crop protection.
 India has launched a massive national training programme to popularize bio logical methods of pest control, which can reduce the consumption and cost of chemical pesticides by 50 to 75 per cent.
 Public education programmes of this type are needed at the national and international level to disseminate information about chemical-free methods to producers and to educate consumers in developed and developing countries about both the health and environmental benefits of organically grown produce.

They were big Hawaiian guys with badges and they did not like howlies.
 They grabbed us roughed us up and handcuffed us because we were two high white guys.
 They drove us deep into a sugar cane plantation.
 We were not going to the police station.
 Pete and I sat in the back of this police car on our bound hands in silence.
 They eventually pulled us out of the car and beat the shit out of us.
 They undid our handcuffs when they were done, emptied our pockets of every dollar, and even took the pot we had.
 They left us in the field and all we knew to do was to walk back the way we came.
 We hitchhiked to the airport and stood outside where the planes were de-boarding.
 We hustled an unsuspecting tourist into buying our surfboards so we could return to California.

What came instead was far more excruciating.
 I expected to collapse as my body disconnected from my mind, but the vines held me in place.
 I saw a few final flickers of the battle before my eyes looked toward the sky, rolling back into my head.
 I had no way of forming a coherent thought or I might have been afraid.
 Chapter Seventeen A Fitting End
 I was surprised, in my dreams, that I wasn’t already dead.
 For a long time, there was no sound, only those disjointed images.
 When the sound came, there was something else wrong.
 It was like… like I wasn’t alone.
 Someone else was there, dreaming with me, and I could see their dreams.

 Harruq hurried down the road, doing his best to pretend he knew what he was doing.
 Most of his bruises had already faded, hidden beneath the gray hue of his skin.
 He drew many glances, however, and he did his best to ignore them.
 The people of Woodhaven accepted him but still viewed his blood in bad regard.
 Elves and humans held little love for the orcish kind and had ever since their creation.
 That distaste suited Harruq just fine.
 Deep down, Harruq felt he deserved their ire.
 He stopped by Maggie’s Place, not bothering to go inside.
 It was early morning and anyone already drinking would hardly be useful.

I’m too old for this shit.
 The minutes click.
 I just want to live through this and see my wife and children again.
 Lisa must be thinking all kinds of things, as, being wired, I cannot call her to give her an update.
 I love her so much, and I always return in my mind to the day I met her and then everything is in perspective and nothing else matters but our love.
 Chapter 12: Who’s Your Daddy Lisa and I discovered “we” were pregnant about four months into our marriage.
 Even though we had not planned to start a family so early, we were thrilled, excited and anxious at the thought of creating a life conceived by the two of us.
 After passing out during the movie at the birthing class, (yes, really!)
 I was not convinced I was going to be the pillar of strength my wife would need during the birth of our child (and neither was Lisa).
 I remember the movie; it was titled “The Brazilian Squatting Method.” Until then, The Exorcist was the scariest movie I had ever seen, and this beat it hands down.

She'd thought the single rose, Lagrimas del Angel, as I was calling it now, had been sweet and thoughtful, especially when I'd told her it was from an anonymous admirer.
 The other roses had been an entirely different matter.
 I'd had to do some pretty quick talking to convince her I didn't know who they were from either.
 All of which meant I still hadn't told her I'd been asked to the Ashure Day Dance.
 Luckily, Rachel was the perfect listener, even if she did cringe a little every time I mentioned Brandon.
 All the things I would've told my mom had instead been shared with Rachel.
 Best of all, there'd been absolutely no hint that she'd blabbed to anyone else.
 I settled deeper into my seat, opening my program as the orchestra started warming up.
 It was amazing to think the near-chaos currently drifting up from the pit would transform itself into the glorious strains of the Overture in just a few minutes.
 I was so intent on the program it should've taken a small explosion to bring my head around, but something caused me to look up as Alec walked past the drapes.

"Should I let it grow longer?"
 "Definitely."
 He smiled.
 "Have a seat--breakfast's ready."
 She sat down and poured milk on her cereal.
 "Mmm--this is delicious."
 "Good.
 Do you want milk or juice or both?"
 They chatted as they ate, and only when she began loading the dishwasher did she remember that she was going to have to spend the day alone.
 "What should I do while you're gone, Rick?"

Mostly those two play them on one another, sometimes on Art.
 The quality of his jokes has suffered ever since he promised not to get into trouble.
 Jim – Oh well.
 Enough of this, how have you been?
 Liz – Lonely.
 (They embrace and kiss)
 Jim – I’ve missed you.
 Liz – I’ve missed you too, it’s about time you came back to visit.
 Jim – I’ve been busy, classes are a bit tougher this year.
 Liz – Finally going to graduate, you sure took your sweet time.

The designs started to resemble portraits and I had to concentrate hard to keep from seeing them, so I focused on landscapes, but those grew from tiny village houses and trees to rolling hills and curving creeks.
 Before long, the hills rose to mountains that melted into unidentifiable monsters.
 I snuffed the flame with a wave and the den was black with night.
 Eventually, the clouds broke and the soft glow of moonlight filtered in through the opening.
 I leaned onto an elbow to examine the glistening patches of light on the skin of my outstretched hand, twisting it from day to night, pale to dark.
 Weary and trancelike, I lowered my head, tucking my arm back as a pillow, and fell into a deep sleep.
 Chapter Seven Steed
 The early morning sun streaked through every break in the makeshift door, lighting the entirety of the hollow.
 I considered covering my head with that damp dress and sleeping the rest of the day, but my stomach ached for food and Chevelle might not be far behind.
 I crawled out, rubbing and squinting my eyes, and was able to locate a few roots and greens.

While I’m writing all this from notes and memory, I decide to pick up my old hardback of Big Sur.
 I still get moved by Jack Kerouac’s honesty and his pictures of the raw and terrifying beauty of people and things.
 After reading about a drive from Big Sur into Monterrey, I go online and look up pictures of the two real people (to whom the book gives other names) on that drive, Kerouac and Neal Cassady.
 Both men were remarkably handsome, some of God’s finest art, I think.
 Then I remember a character from Ken Kesey’s Sometimes a Great Notion, and I realize that Kesey may have used Neal Cassady, a fellow of wild intellect and passion, and a legendary womanizer, as a prototype for his character Joe Ben.
 Only he revised, changed his life, and made Joe Ben a real hero.
 Remembering that Kesey and Cassady were friends, I look up some dates.
 Sure enough, they met while Kesey was writing that novel, two years before it came out.
 And no doubt he had read Kerouac's novels featuring Cassady, a.k.a.

Liz – So do you.
 You seem to have to flirt with all my boyfriends.
 I’ve even seen you chase the gardener and just about every other man you come across.
 Cleo – Elizabeth!
 Liz - Why couldn’t you just leave Jim alone?
 Cleo – Elizabeth!
 Liz – Is there some reason why you have to go chasing after my best friend?
 Cleo – I can’t believe that you are saying what you are saying.
 Why you little ingrate.
 If we were at home right now I would bend you over my knee and spank you.

Not fear of being stuck in 2011 but of spending the day without Rick.
 What would she do?
 She showered while Rick did the same in his bathroom, and she washed her hair with some shampoo she found on the edge of the tub.
 It smelled nice, and she found herself wishing for some perfume or some bath oil.
 She should have thought of that yesterday.
 After toweling her hair dry, she combed it, bound her chest, and put on the blue-green blouse and her jeans.
 Rick was coming down the hall as she emerged from the bathroom.
 "Hi--feel better?"
 She nodded.
 "Hey, let me show you how to use my blowdryer."

It looked like the recreation yard in the film One Flew Over the Coo Coo’s Nest, as people milled about, stopping and turning to look at us as we entered the parking lot.
 The facility itself might have been a roadside migrant worker motel.
 People were roaming around the grounds doing everything from raking leaves to just hanging in groups, but each one stopped what they were doing to examine us as we drove in.
 We could immediately tell that visitors to this desolate location were rare.
 Brandon approached the vehicle with enthusiasm and the brightest broadest smile we have ever seen on his face.
 We instantly noticed his weight gain and he proudly announced through our open car window that he was nearing 170 pounds, and he looked healthy for the first time in so many years.
 His complexion was clear and his eyes were the bright blue they once were and the whites of his eyes were shinny and clear.
 Brandon could hardly wait for us to open the car door and he embraced each of us as if he hadn’t seen us in years.
 I know I hadn’t seen him like this in years.
 He held me so tightly and so long.

He could feel the eyes of his brother on him and did not wish to disappoint.
 “Qurrah has told me of the troubles in your heart.
 I must see them.”
 “He did?” Harruq asked, glancing at his brother.
 His stomach dropped, and his heart quickened as Velixar approached.
 He felt like a truant servant caught by his master…‌which perhaps he was.
 “You killed many yesterday,” the man in black said.
 “Do you feel guilt for their deaths?”
 Harruq took a deep breath, analyzing every word before he opened his mouth.
 Velixar could surely tell if he lied.

Mostly there's just light coming out of the people and the plants and animals.
 It's so beautiful.
 Funny your having more acute senses would make me think of that."
 Alec sighed.
 "It's bordering on stuff I shouldn't tell you, but you deserve to know.
 You've just described exactly how we perceive the world.
 The colors are all more vibrant, the breeze is more alive with scents than anyone could ever know."
 I felt my heart speed up a little as things started falling into place.
 "Your paintings.
 That explains them.

Not in full, as in a Second Coming.
 But in a way so that Jesus entered him and took possession.
 While this thought grips me, both Eric and Jesus become so precious the word adore feels timid and weak.
 Cliff and Toni
 A semi cuts in front of me while we climb Cuesta grade, just north of San Luis Obispo.
 Surrounded by semis, I decide I had better return to the mundane world.
 The last dozen miles to Cliff’s home in Atascadero I spend wondering if I could possibly write something that might introduce Cliff, Billy, and Bob to God.
 I suppose I’m an evangelical but I don’t like to confront people.
 Sometimes I feel ashamed that I haven't been the instigator of more conversions.
 I could offer pages of justifications, but I won't bother, as I recognize how flimsy they are.

He tried to explain.
 “I want you forever.
 I need you, Lizzy.” The yearning in his voice was clear on the last part and I was surprised that I ached for him a little, felt for his pain and need.
 He touched me then and I thought I understood when he continued, “We could be together…” Marriage.
 Yes, he wanted to join us.
 I bit my lip, undecided.
 Curiosity was there, too.
 And I couldn’t help but imagine.
 He was unmagical.
 He had no idea what I could do to him, for him, in such an intimate setting.

 It’s like I lost something that I barely had in the first place.
 I don’t know how I feel yet.

 Eugene – I’m going to go for a walk.
 Need to clear my head.
 Art –I’ll talk to you two later of you want to.
 Liz – Thanks Art.

I'm not much of a shopper anyways."
 That last part sounded pretty weak even to me.
 "Don't be silly.
 Alec hustled you out of your house so quickly you didn't get to bring anything but the clothes on your back.
 Jasmin's clothes will fit you pretty well, but that's only a short-term solution.
 We need to get you stuff to wear, and since it was Alec who created this mess, it's only fair he be the one to pay."
 I was absolutely sure there was no way I was ever going to fit into anything Jasmin owned, but girls being girls, there was no point in protesting.
 Regardless of the truth, Rachel would be obliged to say I was just as skinny as Jasmin.
 "I don't think Alec exactly got me into all of this.
 It was more like my own stupidity that landed me in this particular batch of trouble."

He started to follow her, but she returned seconds later.
 "What's wrong?"
 "I don't want to use your handkerchief.
 I want to keep it and take it home with me.
 It-it smells like you."
 He smiled, stroking her hair.
 "Is there anything else you'd like to have?"
 She thought about it for a moment.
 "Could I have one of your t-shirts?"
 "Of course.

I enjoyed that more than I probably should have.
 I concentrated hard and began throwing a few good hits of my own in with the blocks.
 Our swords clashed repeatedly, neither of us hitting the mark.
 I was certain he could have, but confident I was blocking well.
 We continued until I became winded, then Chevelle lowered his blade, smiling with approval.
 Our audience commented on the show, and I glanced around to see it was evening already, the sun beginning to set.
 How long have we sparred?
 I could feel the ache in my arms now.
 The sword hung limp at my side.
 Ruby took it from my hand.

He crowded in, close enough I could feel my skin start to tingle with anticipation, and then Vincent started the engine and we were off.
 In what was probably the only display of maturity and common sense I'd ever seen out of Vincent, he didn't tear off down the freeway at eighty miles per hour.
 He was still going plenty fast, but at least the wind wasn't deafening.
 After a few minutes of white-knuckled fear, I was finally able to relax a little, and enjoy the feeling of having Brandon so close while the wind tossed my hair back and forth.
 The other girls were studiously ignoring me while they gossiped back and forth about everyone from underclassmen to teachers and other adults in the town.
 I didn't want to join in the gossip, and Brandon was sprawled out on the pickup bed with his eyes closed.
 I settled for contemplating the glorious sunset's myriad colors.
 We passed some kind of border into one of the parks.
 Vincent slowed down a little more as I was busy taking in the incredible pinks and purples that were dominating the western sky.
 It was like someone had splashed glowing paint across a window and then gone back and painted in picture-perfect clouds to complete the scene.

Chevelle kept a quick pace and I found myself struggling to keep up.
 Unlike me, he wasn’t dodging between rocks and trees, bending out of sight and watching the ground to keep from breaking twigs while he tried to keep from being spotted.
 I cursed the formal dress I’d been dragging as it snagged on a low-lying thicket, flinging another string of beads into the soft dirt.
 I considered dumping it, but didn’t think it was the best idea to be sneaking around the forest unclothed.
 After crossing a few soggy patches of moss, the hem was damp and darkened.
 I might have ripped some of the excess material off, but Chevelle’s movement wasn’t leaving me time for that.
 Finally, just before nightfall, he approached a small village.
 It didn’t look like more than half a dozen structures scattered against the base of a large hill.
 He dropped the simple pack he’d been carrying beside a tree and hunched down as he slowed his pace.
 The stance mirrored mine, and gave me pause.

Where did Karak’s prophet linger now that the battle had ended?
 There was only one way to find out.
 He would have to escape the town, regardless of the patrols that swarmed the area.
 He waited until nightfall.
 Even in the dark the elves still patrolled, carrying no torches for their keen eyes had no trouble seeing in the starlight.
 The longer he hid and watched, the more Qurrah was convinced they searched for him.
 The Neldaren troops were long gone, Harruq with them.
 He knew he was being paranoid, but the only other person they could be searching for was Velixar, and the elves were deluding themselves if they thought they could handle him.
 When a smaller patrol turned a corner and vanished, he opened the door, winked at the bloody corpse near the window, and then slipped into the night.
 The scent of mourning floated throughout the town, and he paused to enjoy the bittersweet strands of death that tugged on his heart.

Labour productivity has been increasing in East Asia by 10 per cent a year, half of which is attributable to investment in education and technical skills.
 Training institutions and programmes in most developing countries provide only a narrow range and low level of skill acquisition to a small portion of the population.
 Raise skills to increase productivity by vastly expanding the lower tiers of the agricultural, craft, technical and vocational training systems at the local level to provide practical training in job-related skills to the saturation point.
 Imbalances between supply and demand for skills exist at all levels in developing economies.
 Make a careful assessment of present supply and demand for key skills.
 Compare the density of different types and levels of skill in countries at the next higher stage of development and evolve programmes to raise the quantity and quality of skills to that level.
 4.Improve marketing: The organization of marketing is typically one of the weakest links and, therefore, one of the greatest barriers to economic growth and job growth.
 Brazil set up a distribution system for the export of citrus fruits that has enabled it to become the world's largest exporter of this commodity.
 Improve distribution and marketing systems, especially for agricultural produce, by identifying missing links and establishing successful model programmes that bridge the gap between rural producers and urban or overseas markets.
 5.Expand services: Actively encourage and support growth of the service sector through programmes similar to those utilized to support the expansion of small industry.

 “No.
 I don’t love her.
 Is that what you want to hear?”
 The other half-orc tightened the grip on his whip.
 “Forget what I want.
 If you do not love her, then kill her.
 Now get your head beyond her and focus on the task at hand.
 I want you fighting for a reason, not just to forget.

The horns were curled into his black bushy hair which was long, very thick, and very wild.
 It was sticking out in weird ways from his head.
 All the guards had been confused as to why Ravenhurr had kept him, as it was against the Guild rules to use any of the Hellborn in the ceremony.
 The Immortalist was trying to become Celestial not a member of the Infernal realms.
 It was a very stringent rule that everyone knew not to break, not that any of the guards was going to mention it to the Guild.
 “Who are you?” asked the man that Rodregas had tagged as ‘the leader.’ “I am not sure who I am,” Rodregas responded.
 “And I think I will keep any answers that I figure out to myself for now.” “You are not Gerald though are you?” asked the AElf maiden.
 “Not to ask a dumb question,” Rodregas asked in a curious tone “but who is Gerald?”  Silence followed his query but finally he got an answer.
 “He is the man that you appear to be, whose body you now… have,” responded the maiden.
 “And what are you five named?” Rodregas asked.

I wanted the fire off me, needed it put out.
 When I concentrated on that, the flame flickered.
 It flared again and Chevelle squeezed my hands; I had to be able to do this.
 I focused hard on the base of the flame as it wavered and then fell back toward the hem, where it finally choked off.
 I glanced up at Chevelle.
 He looked pleased.
 “Again,” he said as he stepped back and released my hands.
 The meadow seemed to open as a circle of fire grew in front of me.
 I tried to see past it, through the flames to Chevelle, and then it was gone.
 He was further back now, raising his right hand so a stream of fire followed it, arcing in my direction.

"You mean she's got the job?"
 "Technically it isn't an employment offer.
 It's more in the way of a consulting project, but yes, she'll be in a sense working for the city.
 I've asked my staff to make sure that the confusion is cleared up with the bank as well so you shouldn't be in any kind of danger of losing your house anymore."
 I almost clapped for joy, only there was something off about it all.
 Since when did the mayor personally come to deliver a piece of relatively insignificant news?
 Not only that, why would he be so shaken up?
 He'd actually seemed to be trying to determine whether or not it would be okay to just leave a message.
 Like he was operating by a set of rules he didn't completely understand.
 Or maybe at the order of someone else?

In Minnesota you could always pick out the alpha females by the length of their shorts, and this one seemed to think she was at the top of the food chain.
 That or a complete slut, but with her tan skin and perfect wavy hair, I figured it was probably the former.
 She didn't look like she had to put out to get attention.
 Two minutes later, a smiling blond secretary came waddling out of what was probably the principal's office.
 I spent the time wondering if I should try to make small talk; the gorgeous girl spent it staring out the window.
 The secretary took in the two of us, frowned almost imperceptibly at the length of the shorts and then signed a form for the other girl.
 Determined to at least try and make friends, I started to smile as she turned towards me on her way out, but the expression died as soon as I met her flat green eyes.
 My heart immediately started to race, but she was already gone, moving with grace and confidence out of the suddenly too-small office.
 I'd expected some degree of cliquishness from such a small-town, but this was bad.
 I'd never seen her before, so there wasn't any way it could be some kind of misunderstanding.

It was recognized from the outset that stability of the currency was an absolute precondition for the success of the reform programme, which depended in turn on the firmness and consistency with which it was implemented.
 The central element of the programme was the introduction of a new currency, the `superdinar', in parallel to the existing currency, but without demonetizing or confiscating it.
 Inspired by an experiment in the Soviet Union during the 1920s, the value of the new currency was tied to that of the Deutsche Mark and made fully convertible without restriction.
 Based on the country's very limited foreign currency reserves, new issues of the currency were to be utilized primarily to inject real purchasing power into the economy, revive demand and stimulate production, while covering the government's budget deficit during an initial six-month period needed for sufficient recovery.
 In this way the foreign currency and gold reserves were used as a buffer to moderate contraction of the money supply and avoid the shock usually accompanying such efforts.
 Issuing of the old dinar was stopped, but it remained in circulation as legal tender.
 An interest rate of six per cent was established for the superdinar - the first real, positive interest rate in years - to make holding the new currency an attractive alternative to hoarding goods or foreign exchange.
 It had been widely anticipated by foreign experts that this strategy would result in an immediate run on the country's foreign reserves and thereby a collapse of the new currency's foundation.
 Contrary to expectations, the initial months of the programme have yielded spectacular results.
 Inflation fell to zero per cent in the first week after the issue of the new currency and remained below one per cent during the first five months.

He'd slept hardly at all that night, but he dragged himself to work anyway, not wanting to spend all day alone in the house.
 He'd gotten practically nothing done, and coming home at 8:30 had been torture.
 He'd spent that evening and yesterday evening doing exactly what he was doing tonight: sitting in front of the TV, not seeing, not hearing, not moving.
 How could she have become so much a part of him in only five weeks?
 He'd been engaged to a woman who hadn't been as deeply imbedded in his heart and soul as Marie.
 How could his life ever be complete again without her?
 He wondered if she was feeling the same way.
 Was she finding that home wasn't the same as it had been before she'd fallen in love with him?
 Did she wonder how she could ever feel complete again?
 But no--she was dead!

“The Guild is supposed to be trying to make their Immortalists members Celestial.
 Why would they hold you for two years?” Doi’van nodded but then shook his head.
 “Trust me, I would like to know that answer more then you.” Doi’van’s smile was now long gone and with a shrug of his huge misshaped shoulders, he changed the subject.
 “So, Imeralda, the stone here still seems strong and like new, though clearly, it has been long after the construction of this place.” She was looking at Doi’van strangely and it seemed to take her a moment to shift gears and answer his question.
 “Yes…of course construction like this…stone enchanted to absorb the power…it makes the stone stronger with that power.
 Stones formed like this will last as long as the ley line does not move, which happens only rarely and over centuries.
 What is strange is this is not a farm designed by Nymphs.
 The design of the home and barn is clearly human, yet it would be strange for a simple farmer to be able to afford to have his building built of Nymph stone and way up here in this remote place,” She said.
 “Sir Paladin,” Doi’van asked, “You said you traveled here the first time with friends.
 Might they tell folks of this place?” “No,” Rodregas answered, “they were not exactly friends, and they both died long ago.

But I have to tell you that I'd give anything in this world to have you stay here with me.
 I love you so much."
 Fresh tears rolled down her cheeks, and she laid her head on his shoulder.
 She dabbed at her tears with Rick's handkerchief, noticing that it smelled like his cologne.
 She was going to keep it and take it back with her.
 She'd remember every kiss they'd ever shared whenever she smelled it.
 And grow hot as she remembered.
 Rick's kisses were unlike anything she'd ever imagined.
 She could have spent her whole life watching romances and still never have been able to dream of anything as exciting as Rick's kisses and touches.
 Rubbing her cheek against his shirt, she whispered, "Rick?"

Jim – …I never saw your parents so embarrassed in my life, it was great
 Johnny – Did I miss something?
 Jim – Uhh…Not really, we were just discussing who would win in an all out fight, a gang of angry circus midgets wielding pointed sticks, or the seven dwarves after they find out that Snow White is missing.
 Liz – Ah yeah, yes, that’s it.
 Ten Midgets didja say?
 I’m going with the angry gang of midgets wielding the pointed sticks they have the numbers and pointed sticks.
 Jim – There doesn’t need to be a lot of dwarves, just one of them is worth like 3 midgets, pointed sticks or no pointed sticks.
 What they lack in quantity they make up in quality.
 I mean these guys are huge and muscular, at least from a midget’s perspective, and they have those pick-axes they use around the mine.
 The seven dwarves would win hands down.

And she said, I wasn’t just looking at you because I expected you to remember me.
 You know, you’re not bad to look at.
 I could have looked all night, she said.
 Well, shit, I thought, ok, yeah.
 I can dig this chick, because I mean, she had this body, well, the kind you dream about.
 And she was this novelist’s daughter and so she was cool and kind of bohemian and had this apartment in Midtown, upper floor, with a nice view of Poplar.
 So, I just showed up there one evening.
 And, you won’t believe this, but she was just out of the shower and was wearing nothing but a bathrobe.
 And her skin was glistening with dampness.
 I thought I had stumbled into heaven, man.

Last night was the first time he'd held her except when they were dancing and during their brief kisses.
 And she'd had to trick him into it.
 Didn't he like holding her?
 That was a silly idea—he loved her.
 And he certainly liked kissing her.
 Marie frowned.
 Last night’s kiss hadn't been pleasant at all.
 It had hurt.
 Was that what married kisses were like?
 Her mother had told her that Davis would have a harder time controlling himself now that they were betrothed.

Or she just wanted to talk.
 It was hard to tell with Ruby.
 “It’s been abandoned for centuries,” she offered, making me a bed as she recounted ancient stories.
 She helped me move onto the blankets, the dizziness improved but my muscles weak and drained.
 I asked, “Why are we here?” She twisted her mouth to the side, considering her answer.
 “We were in need of shelter after your… episode.
 It was close enough to work.
 Are you cold?” she asked, tucking me under a blanket.
 “I’ll get it,” I said, waving my hand to form a fire beside us.
 Nothing happened.

 Jim – Being his legal guardian won’t be fun when he does something else really stupid, like the time that he…
 Art – I already told him, as a condition of our adopting him that that sort of thing would end, or the deal was off.
 Jim – Good, the other thing is Johnny himself.
 You know how Johnny is angry at the universe?
 Well Johnny doesn’t like Eugene.
 Actually Johnny seems to hate Eugene more than the rest of humanity on the whole.
 Art – That bad huh?

Rick found his face growing red.
 He'd been thinking about her.
 "Still, I think that's our best bet for getting you back to 1927."
 "All right."
 She set aside the papers on her lap, closing her eyes.
 But seconds later she opened them.
 "I'm so tired–I don't think I can concentrate right now."
 He glanced at his watch.
 "It's 5:45.
 Why don't you take a nap while I make dinner, and you can try after we eat."

He was intrigued by my high school hot rod so we found the same make, model and year of car in horrible condition.
 The only positive comment Lisa could make was, “at least it runs.” I taught both of my boys to drive a stick shift on this beat up Chevelle before my eldest and I began to take it completely apart in an attempt to restore this classic car to its original condition with a hot rod twist.
 The deeper we dug into it, the more rust and damage we found.
 There were so many holes rusted through the bottom we could see the garage floor through the trunk.
 We removed every wire, rubber seal, window felt, and had boxes full of zip-lock baggies that were marked with a Sharpie what the part was and where it had come from.
 When Brandon was about fifteen, we went to Hot August Nights in Reno, a huge hot rod auto show.
 We wandered through these aisles of incredible cherry vehicles and talked about how someday ours could be alongside these beauties.
 This project would prove to be a huge challenge that would last seven-plus years, partly because it coincided with the start of Brandon’s drug use.
 What started as a project he was very enthusiastic about became an afterthought to time with friends and partying.
 He would show up for certain monumental events like when we put the body back on the frame after it was painted, but I was pretty much on my own with it for a bit.

He caught her wrist.
 “Wait.
 I’m not going to hurt you.
 You-you don’t know how to get home, do you?”  When she didn’t respond, he said, “Just come look at my newspaper.
 You don’t have to come inside.
 Just sit on my veranda, and when the fog lifts, we’ll-we’ll see if we can find your house.” Afraid of becoming even more lost, she hesitantly followed him to some chairs and perched on the edge of one.
 The man ran inside, and before she could decide whether it was better to wait or leave, he’d returned with a newspaper.
 Marie read one headline: "Obama Popularity Index Declining."
 Neither the words nor the picture meant anything to her.
 Then she checked the date: May 22, 2011.

And when she left, he'd be devastated.
 But remembering the excitement on her face as she'd danced with the actor, he couldn't regret it.
 The next day they went to Universal Studios.
 "This is set up like an amusement park," Rick told her as he bought their tickets.
 "So even if it isn't authentic, I think you'll enjoy it."
 "I know I will."
 In reality, she wasn't sure.
 The term "amusement park" conjured up visions of carousels and ferris wheels.
 Those were fun in 1927, but she expected more from 2011.
 She wasn't disappointed.

Rodregas backed up, not wanting to see the results of his sword matched against a blue steel sword, as it would likely result in his short sword becoming shorter.
 Rodregas then stepped forward, he had to be careful though, he was a good foot taller than his opponent.
 The guard’s long sword gave him better reach.
 Rodregas swung at him and retreated.
 The two shared several blows.
 The third time that he retreated after taking a blow, the guard went for the kill.
 The guard extended his whole body out in a lunge, thrusting his long sword out to its full length.
 The guard saw Rodregas’ braided leather armor and steel sword and thrust with the point.
 The lunge was perfect, the guard went for dead center, and even though Rodregas had been waiting for a similar move, the thrust almost caught him off guard.
 The guard had only one problem, one that he could not have anticipated.

If you do, I'll tell them the rest.” “Seth!” Jason said and ran over.
 “You're awake, man!” “Yes and I feel like crap,” he said.
 “I think that if I try to stand up I'll either pass out or throw up.” “Will you be okay flying?” Emily asked.
 “What?” I asked.
 “Flying?
 What do you mean 'flying', Emily?” “Our new dragon friend offered to fly us out of the woods region and towards more of the mountains.
 I said yes, of course, because I don't want to walk the whole way there,” she explained and walked towards the dragon.
 “I guess...” Seth said and stood up.
 He paled and started to sway.
 Jason grabbed his shoulder to steady him.

No more.”
 Dieredon twirled his bow, his face calm and emotionless.
 “Too many have died at your hand.
 What life you have ends tonight.”
 Velixar roared, a sound that made Qurrah shiver and avert his eyes.
 His master’s back was to him, so he could not see the face that Dieredon saw, which was full of rotted skin and crawling, feasting things.
 Suddenly Dieredon pulled back.
 The blades in his bow snapped inward.
 “Arrows cannot hurt me,” Velixar mocked.
 “They did not the first time.

 I found myself attracted to her, and enjoyed her company from the beginning.
 And since she didn’t run off screaming, and she did accept my invitation out for coffee, I got to know her better.
 I wonder if she’ll marry me.
 Jim – Damn.
 We’ll find out after you see how she reacts to you telling her about mom.
 Art – Actually she already knows about most of it.

5.Trade: As the socialist structure of these countries began to change and the political influence of the Soviet Union diminished, there was a huge drop in the trade between countries of the region, and, following the break-up of the USSR, between the republics of the Soviet Union as well.
 Not all countries in the region experienced all five shocks.
 Those that were spared proved better able to sustain output and real incomes.
 Czechoslovakia had not suffered from inflation and was largely free of external debt.
 Hungary, which had decentralized its economy and had introduced significant elements of the market in production and investment before 1989, was not subject to the sudden shocks due to import liberalization and termination of planning.
 Lessons from the Reform
 The failure of the transition strategy to produce the anticipated results has given rise to extreme hardship, growing anxiety, frustration and anger within these countries.
 Internationally, it has generated intense debate about the reasons for the failure, the efficacy of ‘shock therapy’, and the appropriateness and adequacy of Western assistance.
 These questions reflect an inadequate understanding, both within and outside the region, of the stages and process and essential conditions for an effective transition under the circumstances prevalent in Eastern Europe at the time.
 Understanding of this failure holds the key not only to the rapid revitalization of the former Soviet and other Eastern European republics, but also to meeting the challenges of present and future transitions in Africa, Asia and the West.

Utilizing ICT, it is possible to deliver custom-tailored instructions for soil improvement in a timely manner at low cost.
 It can help to promote quality and trade literacy among farm women and men.
 Organizational Linkages: In much of the developing world, agriculture suffers from intense fragmentation of land holdings among small and marginal farmers.
 These farmers tend to have lower levels of education, poor access to technology for upgrading productivity, less access to quality inputs and credit, poor access to storage and processing facilities, and higher losses due to post-harvest crop spoilage.
 Their problems are further aggravated by environmental degradation due to soil erosion, deforestation and depletion of water resources.
 Lack of effective organization and management is a common denominator linking all these deficiencies.
 More effective forms of organizations can eliminate or compensate for these deficiencies to a large extent.
 For example, in India more than 10 million farmers are successfully engaged in sugarcane cultivation, precisely because an established system of contract farming provides them with access to technology, quality inputs, credit and an assured market for their produce.
 India became the world leader in milk production only because of the power of scale conferred on small producers through the dairy cooperative movement.
 A similar organization is presently lacking for most other crops.

It had been a hard day.
 I'd....actually I wasn't sure why it'd been a hard day, but something told me I'd unconsciously been at the end of my rope just before I'd collapsed.
 Unfortunately that same thing told me I couldn't dwell here in the comforting absence, there was a very important reason for me to regain my feet.
 The void was reluctant to let me go, stripping me of memories and experiences as I fought my way free.
 By the time I was near surfacing I no longer remembered just how much I'd wanted to stay.
 Britney was pacing back and forth when I opened my eyes.
 She had her cell phone out and was looking like she wanted to dial 911, but was worried about the possible fallout.
 I was on the ground, which for some reason made me more irritable than it should have.
 Didn't she realize how hard it was to make it over to someone before collapsing like that?
 It kind of defeated the whole point if they then put you on the ground where your clothes would take their normal, instantaneous-collapse beating.

And I only had this one chance, this small moment before they came to retrieve me.
 I grabbed the dress off the tree branch—the last evidence of me being here—and threw it into the pack.
 Swinging it around onto my back, I started to run.
 I didn’t know where I was or where the map would take me, but I finally had a purpose.
 There were mountains burned into my palms, and there was only one place to find mountains: In the north.
 I couldn’t remember much of life before going to live with my aunt Fannie.
 The village and surrounding meadows and forests were the only home I’d had, the only place I’d known.
 It wasn’t exactly a comforting place, but there was something to be said for knowing where you were, where to find food, shelter, and water.
 I’d been filled with determination when I’d started running, concentrating on north and nothing else.
 But as I made my way, I became aware of the sheltered life I’d been living.

 How could he have done what he did?
 How could he put doubt in her mind about her fiancé and then-then .

 try to seduce her?
 He loved her and desperately wanted to make love to her, and her response to him was passionate and unrestrained.
 But she was confused--he knew that.
 And he knew that she was a virgin.
 He'd felt her initial hesitation when he'd tried to coax her lips apart, felt the shock go through her body when his tongue had touched hers.

 Tears slid down her cheeks.
 "I love you so much, Rick.
 I wish-I wish I could say let's just forget about everything else and make love.
 But I-I just can't."
 "I want to make love to you more than I want to take my next breath.
 And if you said yes, I'd stop thinking altogether and spend all night making love to you.
 But when all I had left was my memories, I'd feel guilty that I'd taken your virginity and let you go back to 1927 with the guilt I know you'd feel.
 And-and I'd never know if maybe you were pregnant."

 Alec flinched slightly, and then looked at the grotto.

 "Who's Don...." I felt my mouth drop as I finally recognized my surroundings.
 "I've been here before.

 Then I drew it, which I didn't understand because I only ever draw real places, and this was imaginary.
 Only it wasn't, but there wasn't any way for me to know..." I turned around, expecting to have to field a barrage of questions, but Alec was calmly watching me.

He felt his right shoulder crack into fragments.
 Darkness swam before his eyes, darkness dominated by twin red orbs.
 The elf reached into a small pocket of his armor and drew out a glass vial.
 “Healing potions will not aid you,” Velixar mocked.
 “This is no healing potion,” Dieredon said.
 He threw the vial.
 It shattered.
 Velixar snarled as holy light of the elven goddess burned his decaying flesh.
 After a few seconds, the light vanished.
 Velixar glanced about, seeing no sign of the elf.

That requires human resourcefulness in organizational innovation.
 Organization is the means by which people work together cooperatively to achieve common goals and, in the process, to serve society in a wide range of functions.
 The achievement of food security and full employment depends on the establishment of new types of public and private organizations – commercial, financial, industrial, export, research, educational and training.
 These institutions are needed to encourage, support, standardize, regulate and control development activities.
 New institutions lie behind the success of most major development achievements.
 India’s Green Revolution was as much a product of new quasi-governmental organizations created for supplying inputs, warehousing and marketing as it was of new farm technology.
 India’s dairy revolution was propelled by the rapid proliferation of producer cooperatives.
 Thirty years ago government was the only agency capable of setting up and managing activities on so massive a scale.
 Today the society is more developed and many of these functions can be handled more efficiently in the private sector.
 In either case, organization must play a central role.

I smiled.
 “She’s only trying to help, you know.” He spoke with tenderness and I recalled their touch nights ago.
 I made an effort not to be too obvious about my real curiosity.
 “You’ve known her long?” “Forever.” The way he gazed at her when he spoke left no doubt.
 She noticed us watching her.
 “Ready to get back to it, then?” I grimaced, struggling to my feet.
 “Ruby, how long will the effects of the dust last?” “Depends.” It was the same answer she’d given me before.
 I couldn’t decide if I was truly that out of it or if everyone thought it was funny to make me drag answers from them.
 “On?” She laughed.
 “Don’t worry.

When he opened his eyes, Aurelia stood, shocked by the red light wafting like smoke from Harruq’s eyes.
 “You could never know what I am,” he said.
 “I’ve seen what you can be,” she said.
 “Is that not enough?”
 The words stung him.
 His vision swam crimson.
 He felt his hands close upon his swords.
 Perhaps he shouldn’t have saved her.
 Perhaps he should have left her bleeding upon the ground to die alone and…
 “No!” he screamed, flinging himself to his knees.

Who would be out here?
 A neighbor's child, maybe?
 He decided to investigate, although the fog made it difficult.
 To his knowledge, no children had ever come here, but he wanted to be sure that no one was trampling the flowers.
 He almost ran into the girl looking at his fountain.
 "Excuse me.
 The fog is so bad that I almost didn't see you."
 She was so glad to see somebody.
 "I seem to be lost.
 Can you point me in the direction of the large white house with four columns that faces Meadows Street?” Rick stared at the girl.

They played for fifty bucks a night, some beer, a little pussy.
 Early, early.
 There are names that aren’t even on the list, yet they made it all happen, for later cats, for B.
 B., for Furry, for Gatemouth.
 There’s this cat, Beaureguard somebody, played his whole life, man, his whole fucking life, lived in Midtown Memphis, played all the gigs there were back then—and we’re talking back in the Ur days, the days before electricity.
 And he lived to be, oh I don’t know, 117 or something ridiculous.
 Never made it, you know, never cut a record for Chess or whoever.
 But the music was important, it flowed through him, this cat.
 I saw him once, in a tent show—Furry was there—and he just blew everybody away, played with a broken bottle for a slide, old shitbox guitar—and he just blew everybody away.
 He’s in here man, in me, in all the cats who came after.

A roar from Harruq at their heels spurred them on.
 They charged the line, crying out for aid.
 “A creature attacked our town,” shouted the mother.
 “Please, my daughter is still there.
 They might hurt her.
 Please, help us!”
 “There’s two,” shouted one of the farmers.
 “They killed my wife!
 You have to…”
 Their words trailed off once they were close enough to see clearly.

Apparently I'd only thought the anger was under control.
 It frothed beneath the surface right now, anxious for a reason to bite someone's head off, and Britney was the preferred target.
 Only I needed her.
 Not enough to completely dismiss what had happened though.
 "I don't know what you're talking about, but I honestly wouldn't have told you anything I wanted kept a secret.
 Not after the way you told everyone about my panic attacks."
 Britney looked like she was having a hard time getting enough air.
 She gasped a couple more times, and then managed to get some words out.
 "I'm so sorry.
 I didn't realize you'd care.

He was surprised by her words.
 "Do you want me to call in sick?"
 She drew back to look at him.
 "Would you do that?"
 "If you need me, sure."
 She smiled.
 "I need you.
 But I don't want you to miss work.
 I'll finish the laundry and dust.
 We need to go to the market when you get home."

Love heals.
 Along with The Practice of the Presence of God and some mysteries, I have been reading about Feodor Dostoyevski's philosophical positions, because the issues he tackled a century and a half ago are still remarkably current.
 In Dostoyevski the Thinker, I discovered a passage written following the death of his first wife.
 Since I have the book with me, I pull into a turnout overlooking the Pacific, find the passage and reread it.
 "To love someone as oneself, in accordance with Christ's commandment, is impossible.
 The love of personality is binding on earth.
 The self stands in the way.
 Christ could do it, but Christ was an eternal ideal, toward which man strives and must strive, by the law of nature.
 Meanwhile, after the appearance of Christ, as the ideal of man in the flesh, it became as clear as day that the highest, the final development of personality must come to this: that the person should recognize and with the full force of his nature be convinced that the highest someone can make of his self is to annihilate this self, as it were—to give it totally to each and every one, individually and unselfishly.
 And this is the greatest happiness."

“Morning.” She smiled up at him sleepily.
 “Good morning.” She was wearing only his pajama top and looked unbelievably sexy.
 Drawing her close, he bent his head and kissed her.
 Marie sighed with pleasure as she returned Rick’s kiss.
 She’d never dreamed anything could make her feel this way.
 “Are you hungry?” he asked, kissing the tip of her nose.
 “Starved.”  She hugged him.
 They went downstairs with their arms around each other.
 “Did you make pancakes?” she asked.
 “Yeah.

A sharp pain in his gut dragged Harruq from his dreams.
 He lifted open a single eye and glared at the blurry image of his brother.
 “The sun is almost up,” Qurrah said, kicking him again.
 “You need to be as well.”
 “What are you…‌awww, damn it.”
 He sat up straight and shook his head, trying to clear the fuzz that clogged the vast empty space between his ears.
 Qurrah helped by offering a third kick, this one right to the kidney.
 Harruq gasped and staggered to his feet.
 He was outside their little home in seconds, urinating on the grass.
 “Hadn’t pissed yet,” Harruq shouted to his brother.

We locked eyes.
 She left with me that night when the dance was over.
 And we fucked that first night in my little Toyota.
 What a body she had, has, lovely lovely woman.
 God, I still could get horny for her.
 Fucking in a Toyota—(laughs) I don’t recommend it, but we pulled it off.
 And she was, well, kind of big, not like over weight, but like, those legs, hard as timber, and her big ass—I really don’t know how we did it.
 I’m off on a toot here.
 Sorry.
 Lor, sorry.

On his way into the dungeon, he left all the doors propped open so the way out would be clear, and he made sure that all the other doors were closed.
 Luckily, the kitchen drudge had locked herself in the kitchen quarters.
 Rodregas then went back to the dungeon level and opened the opposite door and then the Dire Cats’ prison door and watched.
 He had expected them to either bolt for it or stay in the “safety” of their room.
 Instead they both casually got up and walked out, as if they were guests in a fancy inn, with all the time in the world.
 As they walked out the door both cats gave him a casual glance as he held the two doors firmly closed together bracing for the weight if they threw themselves at the doors, but they just walked by and headed up the stairs.
 He wanted to follow, but Rodregas held himself back patiently waiting until it was safe.
 They might look like lions, but he knew they were smarter than any beast, and they could be setting him up.
 Finally after waiting what seemed like forever, but was probably only about twenty minutes, Rodregas slowly made his way back up through the keep.
 When he poked his head out the entrance there was no sign of Dire Cats or chickens, but he did note a few stray feathers in the courtyard.

She’d wandered far from Rick’s house .
 .
 .
 but she was still in 2011.
 She took a minute to get her bearings and then wandered back toward Rick’s house.
 He was perched on the edge of a chair and sprang to his feet when he saw her.
 “Are you all right, sweetheart?” he asked, taking her hand.
 “Yes.” “I’m sorry you didn’t get home.” Tears filled her eyes.
 “I tried so hard.
 I have on all my 1927 clothes, and I didn’t think about anything but what’s going on at home.” “I’m sorry, sweetheart.”  He led her into the kitchen.

I went home and changed my jeans.
 Case closed.
 And Mrs.
 McGonnigle—McCormack?—McGregor?, or was that the farmer in Peter Rabbit?--bless her heart, forgot about it.
 Let it drop.
 I was reinstated, so to speak.
 Still, I did wear a Che Guevara t-shirt as often as it was clean enough.
 (laughs) Or my Lenin/Lennon.
 That went over well in suburban Central.

Imeralda led the two men over to a corner where a young man lay; he was unconscious and looked near death.
 From his wounds Rodregas guessed he had been injured during the sword and shield competition.
 To Rodregas’ relief no one was paying them any attention, not even to Doi’van.
 Rodregas and Doi’van did their best to block the view of others as Imeralda gathered the limp pale hand that should have belonged to an old man, not a young one, and slipped the small frog figurine into it.
 Quickly she channeled the power.
 Rodregas could feel the instinctive rise of the young man’s own power.
 Then the squire started to squirm weakly in pain.
 Both Doi’van and Rodregas reached out and steadied the young man until it was over.
 Imeralda straightened the sheets for the young squire.
 She then led Rodregas and Doi’van to the figure of a woman.

Chapter 9 I couldn't bring myself to speak to Britney the entire way home.
 It didn't really matter; she spent the whole time complaining about a dozen different ways in which everyone around her was making her life miserable.
 She didn't need any kind of response from me.
 I had the house to myself again, so I worked on homework until I was too exhausted to continue.
 It wasn't until I was almost asleep that I realized I was hoping I wouldn't have one of the incredible, vivid dreams tonight.
 Alec's cameo role in my last two had apparently been sufficient to tie him inseparably to all of the special dreams, and as silly as it was, I didn't want to see Alec right now.
 Not even just in my dreams.
 Maybe there really wasn't any kind of link between him and the dreams.
 Maybe I'd have one of them tonight without him making any kind of appearance.
 I sincerely hoped not, but I'd rather not have them right now than see the disdain he'd displayed earlier in the day.

I was startled to see that the middle ground was inhabited by an attractive girl a year or two younger than me.
 Left to my own devices, I would've normally picked a table over on the nerd end of the room, but I found myself relating more to the girl stuck in the middle.
 She looked up and met my gaze for just a second before ducking back down and concentrating on her homework.
 Shy, obviously, and not popular.
 There'd been the hint of a smile on her face, possibly constrained by fear of how her overture might be received.
 Obviously a complete social reject just like me.
 It was nice to finally meet a kindred spirit.
 Britney's clingy neediness was nearly as bad as the icy indifference or borderline hostility all of the rest of the students displayed.
 Except for Brandon, but I couldn't quite bring myself to trust him.
 A boy that cute wasn't nice to a girl like me unless he wanted something from her.

While Emily and Jason were bickering I said, “Seth?” Seth didn’t answer.
 He acted like he didn’t hear me.
 “Seth?
 Hello earth to Seth,” I repeated.
 No answer again.
 “Seth is there something wrong?” I whispered.
 He didn’t answer me again.
 He continued to stare at the woods as if he expected a flying deer to leap out, wearing pink socks.
 “What the heck Seth, are you deaf now?” I waited for a sign that he heard me to appear on his face, but it remained blank.
 Emily huffed loudly, “Expect something from Jazell and me soon Jason.

He walked with the help of a tall walking stick.
 His arm and side were both covered in bandages.
 Durien followed him in with a heavy stool, which Doi’van quickly sat down on.
 The old healer immediately left the room.
 “Rodregas, you look much better than last I saw you.
 But what is so important that it takes me away from a very important nap?” Doi’van’s body looked worse for the wear, but his eyes showed his natural curiosity and intelligence.
 Rodregas did not think he actually minded coming over to his room.
 Rodregas smiled and thought that given the way Doi’van talked about pain when training them with the staff, that he must be immune to mere pain anyhow.
 Imeralda repeated Jordaan’s question.
 “Jordaan asked Rodregas if you two were related as being Hellborn is very rare in the Eastern Realms.” And Doi’van’s surprised expression Imeralda added, “While I cannot sense the feel and make up of a body like I can a tree, I do know the feel of magic, and I had thought a few times that I sensed the feel of Brimstone and Fire not just with Doi’van, but with both of you.” Rodregas could feel his eyes widen as Imeralda confirmed what Jordaan had felt.

Sitting at the table while he made breakfast, she wiped her eyes and cheeks and nose with a paper napkin.
 "I'm never going to get back."
 "Sure you will."
 "How?
 I walked and walked and didn't get back.
 All I did was get lost--I couldn't even get back here."
 "You should have woken me up so I could go with you."
 "Then you'd have gone back to 1927 too.
 If I'd succeeded."
 "I could have just followed at a distance.

With Isaac's reassuring presence at my side in History, I weathered the renewed gossip, apparently occasioned by the entire pack's absence during lunch for the second day in a row, and soon found myself reunited with Alec in Physics.
 As luck would have it, Mrs. Alexander was gone again, and the substitute was typically clueless about what we were supposed to be doing.
 Alec of course spent the whole class unearthing other little bits of embarrassing information.
 I'd never experienced anything like it, every question I answered spawned two more, and he invariably seemed to figure out the underlying reasons I'd done a given thing, or reacted a certain way.
 I'd just finished describing my failed tryout for the school's production of To Kill a Mockingbird, when he hit me with a completely unexpected question.
 "So tell me about both your best date and your worst date before you came here."
 I felt my skin instantly heat up, and looked down, unable to meet his gaze.
 He let me sit there for a couple of seconds, and then reached out and used one gentle finger to nudge my chin up.
 "What's the matter, afraid I'll be jealous?"
 I shook my head, fighting the urge to look back down.

I didn’t know anything about anything.
 She glanced to the watching eyes and again to me.
 I was sure they were waiting for something.
 “Well, it’s just that I remember reading in the village about castles in the North.” Was I supposed to have read that?
 Had that been in the documents I had pilfered from the library?
 Shut up, Frey, shut up!
 They seemed to relax a little as Chevelle shook his head and brought his horse back to pace.
 I thought I knew what they were thinking.
 Idiot.
 Ruby answered, “Hmm,” with a cocked eyebrow as she turned to follow the group.

The next day things had calmed down, and Brandon admitted to needing professional help, more than we could offer.
 He had been living on less since he was on lock-down and that was lowering the level in the tests, but he was really never without Oxy.
 It was late 2008 and my business was suffering the effects of the economic meltdown.
 Just a couple of years before that my business income had been five times what it was then.
 Bryce, in college, was working three jobs to pay his own expenses, something we could no longer afford to help with.
 Simply put, we were falling behind on everything and we didn’t have the money to put Brandon in a rehab; so we began searching the internet for someplace that would take him without an exorbitant amount of cash.
 The State run agencies were crammed with voluntary admissions and court ordered treatment.
 Brandon’s girlfriend, Tiffanie had already been in a thirty-day rehab twice before.
 We had heard plenty of horror stories from her about her stint in the county rehab: Apparently, several people had over-dosed on drugs while in the facility, one had died, and she had relapsed and used Oxy while she was in there.
 The problem with a facility that accepts court ordered patients is that the patient doesn’t want to be there.

I should have been overjoyed I wasn't in trouble.
 Instead I felt guilty for being given far more credit than I deserved.
 I opened my mouth to object, but was waved back into silence.
 "Obviously I don't want you to make disrupting my class a habit, but that isn't why I wanted to talk to you.
 Your studies are coming along nicely, and I've heard quite a few good things about you from other sources, so I'd like to offer you a job."
 Now that I had a chance to talk, I wasn't sure what to say.
 Nobody had ever wanted to hire me.
 Mrs. Campbell gave me a tired smile.
 "The tutor lab is still understaffed.
 Obviously you couldn't spend your whole afternoon tutoring, as that would negatively affect your efforts to catch up.

Alternately he savored the taste and feel of her and then devoured her, feeling her passion and hunger grow.
 Almost without thinking, he slipped his hand inside her blouse just to touch the soft skin of her midriff, but he withdrew it when he heard her gasp.
 “I’m sorry,” he whispered.
 “No .
 .
 .
 no,” she breathed.
 “I like it when you touch me.” Rick groaned as she kissed his neck.
 When he touched her midriff again, he felt her muscles clench in response.
 Her skin was softer than anything he’d ever touched .

It's more a matter of wanting to, if I can say that without making things all weird.
 I have obligations at school, people who depend on me.
 I can't spend the time I'd like getting to know you there, so it just made sense to free up some time in the mornings to make that happen."
 Everything was just too unreal.
 I couldn't believe it was all happening, so I chose to ignore the implications of what he was saying.
 Boys like him didn't go for girls like me.
 They didn't even acknowledge the possibility unless they were after something.
 We'd been driving in more or less comfortable silence for several minutes before I decided to act before things got uncomfortable.
 "So, tell me about yourself."

 She slid over beside him, her long hair cascading toward his face.

 “Since you’re down here, how about I—”

As he came to rest the sound of arrows was quiet, part of his mind knew that Imeralda was backing deeper into the forest.
 As he cleared the mess he had made of the last slaver, Rodregas came face to face with an Immortal Guard.
 Behind him were two more slavers.
 The Immortal Guard wore the classic half plate of regulation Immortal Guard armor: A full suit of Mithril chain covered with a breastplate and leg guards and vambraces for the forearms.
 His head was covered with a half helm.
 His Mithril was shining in the sun.
 His breast plate was solid dark Night Bronze.
 The middle of his breastplate had the symbol of the Immortalists, an eagle soaring up into the clouds.
 In his left hand was the regulation one handed long sword of the guard.
 In his right he held a small round shield.

He had been clean for six years, and I could only pray for the same result.
 He had worked there since he graduated the program and he assured me they would do their best to help Brandon.
 The facility where Brandon was staying was nearly a nine-hour drive from our home.
 We talked to Brandon on the phone occasionally and every time we did it was as if a cloud was slowly lifting and he was starting to think more clearly.
 He seemed to be growing up.
 He had never really matured like his younger brother because in his world of drugs he was not living reality.
 Easter was rolling around and we planned on visiting him with the family, but only if he completed certain parts of his program by Easter.
 If so, he would be allowed a LOA (Leave Of Absence) for the day.
 If not, we would have Easter with him at the facility.
 He would have been an inpatient for over two months by then, and the Narconon program would keep him as long as they needed until he was ready to graduate or until he left on his own.

It disrupts fish in their blue aquarium lives.
 It calls like a squonk in the wee hours, in the time between sleep and dawn.
 It disrupts phone lines, calls old girlfriends and makes them want you again.
 It stirs mud and makes bouillabaisse.
 Black Lung fashioned alchemy, friends, at least once, in that small studio, over a period of 72 straight hours without sleep, so the story goes.
 They laid down 43 minutes of catalytic reverb love.
 Some of you understand.
 (And, an aside: they did not feel it necessary to include that one song on the LP by the drummer.
 An uncommon display of wisdom for the times but a good thing.
 Skippy could no more sing or write a song than fly.)

Seth punched his arm.
 “Hey don’t make me nag you about the time you almost took off my head with your throwing knifes.” Jason stopped dead and narrowed his eyes.
 “It was an accident.
 I didn’t know you’d run that way.” “Alright, we understand that we’ve all done stupid, foolish things.
 So let’s just add this accident to my list, okay?” I said quickly before the two started something.
 They nodded but shot each other smirks.
 I sighed, wondering why those two buffoons had been granted this power along, with Emily and me.
 It’s not like they weren’t foolish enough already.
 The day when it all changed was still a mystery to us.
 A lot of things happened that didn’t quite make sense.

 You wouldn't have stopped me."

Let the silence work on people for a little while and they'll usually start to crack."
 That was the last thing I wanted to do right now, but I kept my mouth shut anyways.
 It was almost like I could see the gray matter starting to heat up as the mayor tried to figure out exactly what I knew and how much I just suspected.
 "Act of God indeed.
 Fancy that.
 Well, surprising as it may be, Fredrick doesn't know everything there is to know about the world."
 He was turning to leave, and most of me was screaming to just thank him and wave goodbye, but there had been something in his eyes that had me convinced he'd been lying.

 I guess I need to learn more about civic government.
 I can't wait to go into whatever records are public and learn about all of the ways the mayor works with the banks.

So long as the benefits of development are confined to one or a few sections of society, the costs of militarization and war may not prevent economic and social progress.
 But when the need is to fulfil the rising expectations of the masses by extending the benefits of development to the entire society – thus enabling the society as a whole to move to the next higher level of collective affluence and fulfilment – every social resource must be garnered and harnessed for this purpose.
 The colossal cost of armaments and the catastrophic destruction of war are incompatible with the achievement of prosperity for all.
 Peace has become the fundamental imperative for development.
 War as an Instrument of Policy
 Humanity has lived with war for so many millennia that it is difficult to imagine a world without it.
 Even in the four decades of ‘peace’ following the Second World War, approximately 160 inter-state and intra-state wars, including 100 major conflicts, have been fought in developing countries, leading directly to 20 million deaths – half of them caused by the armed forces of developed countries in Korea, Indochina, Algeria and other anti-colonial wars – and to another 20 million war-related casualties.
 These massive casualties during a time of ‘peace’ are roughly equal to the total casualties incurred by all the countries of the world during the last world war.
 An equally disturbing phenomenon has been the expansion of violence within society for political purposes.
 Of the 82 armed conflicts between 1989 and 1992, only three were between states.

If my exciting you mean ‘did I make a fortune and decide to retire,’ then no it was a dull trip.
 Liz – I’m sorry.
 Art – Don’t be.
 I did get to ogle a great many women half my age wearing not but skimpy swimwear.
 It was truly a wonderful experience for a man my age, or for a man of any age for that matter.
 Well Elizabeth, I am truly impressed with your talent once again.
 So much creativity and talent combined into a pretty girl.
 You’ll make some lucky man very happy one day.
 Liz – Thanks Mr. Trelain, Jim was just telling me what he thought.
 I would appreciate hearing your opinion on what you like and dislike.

Rodregas had to admit she did look tired.
 “First, Geriodon is much disliked.
 He is gruff, unfriendly and too serious to like.
 The squires and knights universally dislike him.
 This is his third attempt to achieve knighthood and he has gotten closer each time.
 While he is the odds on favorite to achieve it this year, no one wants him to win,” she said.
 “I went and chatted with him,” she continued “and he hates the Immortalists, but is rather unpleasant and needs to take a bath.
 But he is also clearly very honorable.
 And when I asked him why he wanted to be a knight…” she paused then added, “he said that some ‘Infernally damned knights’ have to stand up and fight.” “So you think he is a good man?” Rodregas asked.
 “I think Geriodon is a ‘holier than thou’ stick in the mud, who needs to learn to bathe and not mumble when he speaks.

Just promise to bring it back in the same condition.
 Remember, I'm less concerned with your answer, and more interested in the process you take to try and solve the problem.
 Of course the right answer never hurts."
 I smiled and hurried out of class with a 'thank you'.
 I shouldn't have bothered rushing.
 I slipped into Spanish exactly three seconds before the late bell sounded, but Mrs. Tiggs wasn't even there.
 When she finally did show up, we had a surprise quiz on our vocabulary.
 Once we finished she turned on the television and told us to listen for conjugation.
 I almost wished I shared the class with Britney, her dad seemed like the type to get six kinds of riled up over something like that.
 He'd probably go straight to the school board and demand a new Spanish teacher altogether.

And as finals approached, Laura Steinhoff's boyfriend Frank Holmes stopped by our apartment and pitched us a better idea.
 Better especially for me whose sole living hero was Jack Kerouac.
 Frank wanted to take off driving and stop in New Orleans for Mardi Gras.
 After that, we could just point the car north or east and go.
 So Bob and I dropped out of college after one semester, even though we risked getting drafted and sent to war.
 We pooled our money, bought an old Chevy, and pulled on to Highway 80.
 By New Orleans, we were low on money, and after one night in that town where we eighteen-year-olds could legally drink, we were broke.
 We slept in our car near a park on the far side of a rundown neighborhood from the French Quarter.
 For food and spending money, we foraged for soda bottles and redeemed them.
 With my share, I bought just enough beer so the proprietor of a smaller Bourbon Street bar allowed me to remain on a stool from which I admired a certain barmaid.

 On the posters, we were put above him, man.
 I was sick about it.
 So, when time came, we just told him, look, you’re going on last.
 We warm up for you.

Mostly it was just talk.
 I’d sit in, we’d all be in a room and we’d just chant for an hour or so.
 It was ritualistic.
 But, those songs…beautiful stuff.

“So first I make my infernal side more structured and then I become a part Nymph, a strange combination for a Hellborn.” Rodregas said, “I think we both feel the importance of the blessing and I thank you for sharing it.” She nodded and said, “I am so happy that I decided to go with you to sneak in, otherwise I would never have been able to receive the blessing of the One Tree.
 No matter how successful we are now against the Immortalists, I have been blessed as few of my people have.” Imeralda looked like she wanted to talk and Rodregas hated to break the mood, but they needed to get back to business.
 “We should return to the main chamber.
 The Grand Marshal will be coming soon for the official moment for me to take on a greater sigil, and I don’t think we want them to find these chambers.” As Rodregas walked from the chamber of the One Tree he felt more regret than when he had left the Infernal chamber; though in all likelihood the sigil from the Night Panther would prove to be of more use on his quest.
 The three walked as one to the Celestial Lion.
 They looked first at the great beast and then at Rodregas.
 “Are you sure I have the magical strength to take on two greater sigils?” he asked Imeralda.
 “Few have such strength; taking a second greater sigil seems to consume far more power than one.
 It is not just twice as much, but far more.
 Only the most powerful have such magic, but you have the power of an Immortalist mage.

I studied the other newcomer, who acted as if I wasn’t present.
 He was incredulous, staring at Chevelle when he spoke.
 “Her mother slaughtered your clan, your family.
 Why release this terror—” The man’s words were cut short, his face contorted in pain.
 Chevelle had gone rigid, every muscle tense.
 The councilman struggled, suffering from some unseen force.
 Blood poured from his nose and I gasped.
 Chevelle’s head jerked toward me and I couldn’t catch my breath—his eyes were as black as onyx.
 When his focus returned to the men, they eased away, the first supporting other by an arm as both bowed slightly, stepping and stumbling in their retreat.
 Chevelle watched them until they spun to disappear, and then he turned to me.

Grey was gone again, this time reappearing midair in a flip above Steed’s head, reaching down to tag him on the way by.
 It was a loud smack.
 I was sure it had stung.
 Steed stood still, focused on the spot where Grey had landed and was flickering in and out of view.
 I made an effort to consider possible responses in my head, but was coming up blank.
 The nerves were gone.
 I found myself wanting Steed to win and leaned with his strikes, tensing as if they were my own.
 Grey bounded through the air once more, showing off, confident in his evident lead, and then a small rock rose at chest height in front of Steed.
 I was trying to figure out who had lifted it when Grey flashed back into view, hesitating only a moment as he considered the rock.
 At once, his face changed; he knew he’d been beaten.

It might even be fun to sit back and laugh at some of the antics making an appearance as people got more and more wasted.
 Instead I was stone cold sober, and the next best thing to completely friendless.
 About the time Vincent tapped the second keg, Brandon looked over at me and flashed a thoughtful smile.
 I would've said nothing could've made up for the last two hours, but it came remarkably close.
 "I'm sorry, this isn't any fun for you, is it?"
 My listless shrug earned me a chuckle.
 "Well then, let's change stuff up a little.
 Care to dance?"
 I almost said no, but as he pulled me in towards him, I suddenly realized just how badly I wanted to touch his incredibly hard chest and shoulders.
 Being wrapped in his arms was so pleasant that I didn't even protest when he pulled me in closer.

I should have talked to him about it a few years ago.
 Kids grow ups so damn fast, and there’s never enough time.
 Eugene – I think I have it.
 Art – Alright let’s have it then.
 Eugene – Art, will you adopt me as your own?
 Art –Uh?
 Eugene – I asked if you would adopt me into the family.
 Art – I heard you, I was just a bit surprised by the request.
 I was expecting that you would need me to testify for your character.
 Besides we’ve pretty much adopted you already.

He knew that she wanted him, and he didn't think she'd respond to his touches and kisses the way she always did if she didn't love him.
 He could make her happy if she stayed here with him.
 They'd get married and make love day and night.
 And soon they'd have children.
 She'd have a family here, and that would make up for the family she had in 1927.
 They swam and played in the surf, but Marie thought Rick seemed very sober.
 Did he think she was still angry with him?
 Maybe he wasn't feeling well.
 Taking his hand as they returned to their blanket, she asked, "Are you feeling all right, Rick?"
 "Yeah, I'm fine."

After lunch she’d come home to take a nap.
 The house would be hot in the afternoon.
 “Don’t forget to pick up the dry cleaning!” Marie jumped, looking up to see who’d yelled.
 A car door slammed, and she saw a sleek gray car back out of a driveway.
 She’d wandered far from Rick’s house .
 .
 .
 but she was still in 2011.
 She took a minute to get her bearings and then wandered back toward Rick’s house.
 He was perched on the edge of a chair and sprang to his feet when he saw her.

Why on earth did every single one of them think it was necessary to mock fight, throw balls back and forth to each other, or otherwise make a spectacle of themselves?
 My mood was further soured as we arrived to find an unmistakable circle of bystanders signaling an impending fight.
 My first instinct was to go find a teacher before the two idiots hurt each other, but while I was still looking around to see if there was an adult in the room, Britney grabbed my arm and pulled me towards the circle.
 It wasn't until we got closer that I realized there was something wrong with the circle of kids surrounding the combatants.
 Normally everyone pressed in tight for the best possible view.
 The spectators in this fight were divided into two groups, with a fairly significant space between them.
 The rest of the students seemed to be reluctant to fill that gap in.
 It wasn't until Britney pulled me closer that I understood why.
 Brandon stood surrounded by his friends on one side of the circle, with Alec and a smaller group standing opposite them.
 The tension in the room was like the air before a lightning strike, charged and unpredictable, a living organism on the point of materializing out of thin air and attacking anything surrounding it.

The next morning Harruq did not put on his armor or prepare his blades.
 “I have to see Aurelia,” he told his brother, who nodded in understanding.
 “I will wait for you,” Qurrah said.
 “Return before the battle starts.”
 “I will,” Harruq said.
 Then he was gone, rushing down the streets of Woodhaven toward the calm forest that nestled about it.

 “Aurry, are you there?” he shouted.
 He had hoped the elf would be waiting for him, but as he neared their usual clearing there was no sign of her.

In addition, instead of the severe contraction of output experienced elsewhere, production rose by more than 100 per cent during the first five months, stimulating an increase in employment and demand for new investment.
 Real tax revenues have increased significantly.
 The astonishing initial success of the programme can be attributed to its balance and comprehensiveness, and to the following specific features: the government's recognition that stabilization was absolutely essential to economic recovery; the widespread public support for the programme, which was in large part due to the efforts to protect weaker sections from its harshest effects; the simultaneous relaxation of controls on industry; support for a natural rather than a forced process of privatization, based on the specific circumstances of each firm rather than on ideology; continued price supports for agriculture and a minimum wage for labour, which are crucial for maintaining food supplies and social stability; and rejection of import liberalization in order to protect domestic manufacturing against a major shock during the initial period of recovery.
 Possibly the greatest strength of the Yugoslav programme is that it was of necessity conceived by people within the country rather than by foreign experts, and depended entirely on domestic resources and capabilities for its accomplishment, rather than on pleas for foreign assistance.
 Self-reliance released the creativity, generated the determination and mobilized all available resources to make the transition successful.
 It is too early to predict the eventual outcome in Yugoslavia, subject as it is to extraordinary external constraints on public policy.
 However, the initial evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that alternative approaches can and must be fashioned which are more comprehensive in scope, more balanced in implementation, more pragmatic in conception and less influenced by extreme ideological viewpoints.
 It is likely that further study of the Yugoslav model will reveal important applications not only for countries suffering from hyperinflation or the effects of radical transition, but for those carrying out more modest programmes fo economic reform.
 Recommendations for Accelerating Transition in the East
 Conditions within the 25 nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia vary significantly enough to limit the scope for broad generalizations on strategy beyond the statement of principles presented in this chapter.

"Well, no.
 Not proper, really, but not immoral."
 He reached out to squeeze her hand.
 "Listen to yourself, Marie.
 You're describing a crush, not love.
 He's tall, he's handsome, he makes you feel romantic--you don't love him!
 He's like a movie star."
 She withdrew her hand, her eyes flashing.
 "You don't know.
 He works with my father, he's already like a member of the family--" "Let him be a brother.

Fire was the one magic I had mastered; I had been able to light lanterns and candles for as long as I could remember, but I didn’t bother.
 If I was in this room, I wanted to be alone.
 And in darkness I felt more so.
 Chapter Two Chevelle
 I was usually a late sleeper, but the next morning I was out of the house early.
 I wanted to get away before I had to face Fannie in the middle of her wine hangover, and I knew Junnie could tell me if Evelyn had turned the town or Council against me.
 I rushed up the path and through the village gate, keeping my head down.
 No one generally went out of their way to speak to me, but I didn’t want to take any chances.
 The other elves didn’t have much use for one who wasn’t able to contribute.
 My lack of magic and skill had put me far from their minds.

 Rick groaned.
 "You've been watching talk shows."

 And she was 32!"
 "Don't watch that garbage.
 Those people are poor and uneducated and have no morals, and people watch that stuff to be horrified and make fun of them.
 Most people aren't like that."

“Plus I’m not evil, so why shouldn’t I help you out?” “Uh thanks I guess.” This situation was extremely awkward to me.
 She winked and disappeared in a flash.
 I limped over to my body ignoring Seth’s yells to tell me to sit down.
 I felt the wind pick up and was whisked back to my normal self.
 I felt fine except for the fact it hurt to stretch my left side.
 I would probably be extremely stiff and sore tomorrow morning, but I was used to that feeling.
 We began to walk back towards the park when Jason stopped us.
 “Hey can Seth and I catch you guys later?
 We have something to do.” Jason grabbed Seth and they took off.
 Emily raised an eyebrow, “Should we be concerned?” “Nah they’re boys, let them do what they have to do,” I said with a quick sigh.

 You didn’t give him the idea to tell the anorexics that they were fat did you?

"She isn't my Kim--not any more."
 It had been over a year since they'd broken up.
 "Yeah.
 So I thought maybe she could be my Kim.
 I ran into her at lunch downtown, and I invited her out for drinks that evening.
 She's good, Rick.
 It was the first time I'd been alone with her--you know, without you and my own date--and it took her less than ten minutes to figure out that I'm not exactly the marrying type.
 I still don't know how I gave myself away.
 It was a first."

My knees buckled as I released too much and I had to back off, giving myself just enough to control it.
 As it entered the wound, the tracker gasped and my smile stretched wickedly.
 I wormed my way blindly up his leg, intent on getting the information I needed.
 They’re getting closer.
 They’ve found us a third time now.
 They’ll kill us.
 I wanted to free my mind, free my bonds.
 They won’t take me.
 Something about that last thought didn’t seem right, like it wasn’t mine, but I couldn’t follow it.
 The tracker screamed; it had reached his thigh.

I stood up and shook the heavy body off.
 I didn’t even have time to breath before one of the Thrashers decided that they would like to have a taste of me.
 I decided that I didn’t want to be shredded like some old rug, so I moved out of his path.
 That was the worst mistake I made, without even realizing it.
 At the same time another Thrasher was heading in my direction, and by moving out of the way from the first one, I had placed myself in the path of the second one.
 It slammed into my side at such a great force I tasted blood in my mouth, when I hit the ground.
 Then I felt pain, saw blood, and then nothing at all.
 Chapter 4
 I heard muffled voices around me as I regained consciousness.
 My head throbbed slightly, and so did my side and my tongue.

Rick took the dishes from her.
 "We're not going to spend our last hours together doing dishes."
 She swallowed, running her hands over his t-shirt.
 "I wish I had something from 1927 to give you."
 He stroked her hair.
 "You could leave your dress and go back in your bathing suit."
 She smiled.
 "I'll have enough to explain as it is."
 Inspired by the way he was toying with her hair, she asked, "Would you like to have a lock of my hair?"
 "That's a great idea."

Cuddled up against his chest with the familiar, warm tingle caressing my skin, my system apparently decided I was completely safe, and started shutting down.
 I was doing a fairly respectable job of hiding my drooping eyelids, but all my efforts were undone by the prodigious yawn that ambushed me as he set me down on the bed.
 "I'm not tired, I promise."
 His eyebrow arched in disbelief as I pulled him down onto the bed, and I found myself admitting the truth.
 "Okay, I might be a little tired, but it isn't a big deal.
 I want to spend as much time with you as possible.
 After all, it isn't like I'm going to be able to really get much rest between now and whenever we need to leave for the challenge."
 His wonderfully expressive face froze into the stony mask he wore so often with the rest of the world.
 "You weren't planning on bringing me, were you?"
 "It's not safe, Adri.

She batted away the flames and smiled.
 “Come now, you’ll have to do better than that.” She kept circling.
 “Let me try harder.” She flicked her wrist, and the end of her whip caught my ankle so fast I hadn’t even realized it was moving.
 She jerked and my leg came out from under me, my hip slamming flat on the ground.
 It hurt.
 The pain stole the heat from my anger, and I struggled to stand.
 Crack!
 The whip struck at my head, forcing me back down.
 She circled me, cracking the whip every time I attempted to right myself.
 I couldn’t get a foothold.

Mrs. Alexander shuffled over and smiled at the pair of us.
 "Sixteen grams.
 Most impressive, you two.
 An entire gram more than I would have ventured to risk myself, and done before anyone else.
 I thought the pair of you would make a great team."
 The easiest thing would have been to stay quiet and just let her believe I'd played an integral part of the project, but I didn't like getting credit for something I hadn't done.
 It was the worst kind of lying.
 "Mrs. Alexander, I didn't actually do any of it.
 I kept making mistakes."
 She chuckled so hard, for a second I thought the pencil behind her ear was going to fall out.

"I just made you spill yours, it's only fair."
 Brandon nodded at Britney, who stood there with her mouth slightly open, as he walked away.
 After a second or two of both of us staring blankly after Brandon, Britney grabbed me by the hand, the one holding the new, unopened water bottle, and pulled me over to a table in the corner.
 "Oh my gosh, you just poured water all over Brandon Worthingfield the Third.
 And then he talked to you.
 This is so incredible."
 I more or less fell into my seat, staring at my new bottle of water as Britney's chatter poured over me.
 It was pointless to try and pay attention to anything she was saying.
 It was all I could do to remember to nod when she paused and looked at me expectantly.
 Lunch passed all too quickly.

He looked even more gorgeous than normal.
 I'd gone back and forth, both with myself, and with Rachel, on how much to dress up.
 Going in normal street clothes would've cheapened the experience, but I hadn't wanted to stick out too much from the rest of the kids, all of whom I'd been pretty sure would be in shorts and polos.
 I'd been right, which had made me glad I'd compromised and come in my one and only sun dress.
 Alec apparently hadn't gotten the memo.
 He was in an honest-to-goodness full tux.
 I wasn't the only one stunned by how good he looked; there was a ripple of turned heads as people noticed his entrance.
 He paced the short distance down to the back row of seats with such incredible grace that I felt my mouth go dry.
 No one person should be so attractive, not when there wasn't enough of him to go around to every single woman in the world.
 For a few seconds I forgot all about the reasons I didn't like him, and just wished he was sitting in front of me instead of two rows behind me where I couldn't see him.

“They are my family.
 This is my home.
 I cannot abandon them.”
 Harruq’s heart skipped, and the words of his brother echoed in his head.
 He had to make her understand.
 “Aurry, I’m asking you, please don’t fight.
 You aren’t needed.
 The elves will win, right?
 Right?”
 Aurelia shrugged.

Besides, I glanced to the right of the kid and saw the babe with auburn curls.
 She stood with hands folded at her waist and creamy white legs quivering below the hem of her flowered sundress.
 Then I knew for certain that if I smiled and she smiled back and I asked her name and number and picked her up later at her churchgoing folks’ house and promised to bring her home by midnight, I would drive to a lookout at the sea cliffs and invite her into the back seat.
 And if she complied, I would do exactly what I would have done yesterday, before I surrendered.
 I might be forgiven, but I felt no less corrupt than before.
 Lucky for her, we lost her in the crowd.
 In the car, Cliff and I didn’t mention surrendering.
 We drove to a party, and told nobody about Billy Graham.
 We stayed in the kitchen, drank a couple beers and talked baseball with a few lonely guys.
 A card game started, but poker is no fun if you don’t care who wins.

For he and his brother, that was life.
 What the abyss was he doing asking for work?
 A swelling of nerves in his gut almost forced him to leave.
 Several men in front of him turned away, dejected or angry.
 He didn’t hear the reasons why and didn’t want to know.
 The idea of so much money, more than enough to buy warm food and clean drink, kept him there.
 At last it was his turn, and he approached the table where Alvrik sat chewing on a piece of bone long since void of meat.
 “You,” he said before Harruq could mutter a word.
 “You don’t look like all the others.”
 “I’m not like the others.”

I sighed.
 But Ruby looked hopeful.
 The group approached warily, keeping their eyes on me.
 Chevelle hung farther back, avoiding my gaze as he hovered near the edge of the mist.
 Steed led my horse to me.
 I didn’t think I blamed him—he seemed to be involved by chance—but I hadn’t fully decided yet.
 As we rode wordlessly through the cold stone landscape, my thoughts twisted and writhed as if a pit of vipers.
 In the end, I’d decided I wasn’t really that shocked about being half-human.
 It explained so much about myself.
 Clumsiness, lack of skill, never quite fitting in.

But I would have had a part of him.
 And I would have loved that child with every fiber of my being."
 She took Marie's hand, squeezing it.
 "I don't know if it's any comfort, but I understand how much you're hurting."
 Marie burst into tears, hugging her mother.
 "I love him so much."
 "I know."
 After a few moments, Marie drew back to wipe her eyes.
 "What about Father?"
 "I met him two years after I lost Andrew.

 Eugene – It was obvious, why else would a beautiful, talented, wonderful, intelligent girl like Liz spend time with you?
 Johnny – He has a point.
 Jim – Touché
 Eugene – Wait, you already knew that Elizabeth is in love on you?
 Jim – Yeah.
 Eugene – And you haven’t done anything about it?
 Johnny – What do you expect?
 Jim is a very special child.
 Eugene – Even so, having a girl like Elizabeth Straun feeling that way about you, and not doing anything about it.

I suddenly found myself wishing I'd told him the truth rather than making him think I was stupid and manipulative.
 It was too late.
 He was already out of sight, and by now his opinion of me was fixed.
 Chapter 4 School hadn't gotten any worse after I'd convinced the hottest boy on the planet that I was a complete waste of oxygen, but it hadn't gotten any better either.
 Mrs. Tiggs, my Spanish teacher, had seemed every bit as mean as my Biology teacher from earlier in the day, and it had been a relief when Britney had finally dropped me off at home.
 I watched Britney's little white Saturn disappear down the lane with a complex set of feelings that included a bit of loneliness and more than a little relief.
 After a minute or two spent staring off into space, I finally decided the discomfort in my stomach was sharp enough to justify the effort of eating.
 Given the ridiculous heat, studying was the last thing I wanted to do, but there wasn't really anything else to do so I changed into cooler clothes and made the best of it.
 Three hours later my brain felt like it was going to run out of my nose, so I wandered upstairs.
 It was still too hot for comfort in my room, but unpacking in the heat was better than facing the math problems waiting for me downstairs.

Chevelle stopped on a ridge to allow us a better view.
 I didn’t think I would have called it a village—I couldn’t count the structures from our vantage point but it must have been ten times the size of home.
 The buildings were the dull stone of the mountain.
 None were trees.
 There was really no vegetation at all, no greens, no browns.
 The entire layout was dark, ashen stones and aged wood that seemed to melt right in to the blue-gray of the mountain.
 The cloudy mist filtered the sun.
 I decided it was beautiful.
 “Where are we?” I asked.
 Chevelle nodded toward my hands as he started down the path.

His quiver, as was the quiver of every elf flying alongside him, contained water given to them by their clerics of Celestia.
 When their arrows bit into dead flesh, it would be like fire on a dry leaf.
 “Let no life lost this night be in vain!” Dieredon cried as they descended like a white river, raining arrows into the darkness.
 More than two hundred moving forms halted after that one pass, but a thousand more swayed in their sick, distracting dance.
 “One free pass,” Velixar said, observing the flight of elves as they swarmed overhead.
 They banked around, still in perfect formation, and then dove again.
 “Kill them now!” he ordered, his fingers crooking into strange shapes.
 “ _Hemorrhage!_ ” Qurrah hissed, pointing at the nearest horse.
 Blood ruptured from the beautiful creature’s neck.
 The rider steadied her best he could, knowing his doom approached.

In the end, the reasonable part of me never had a chance.
 Waking up next to Alec fully vindicated my decision.
 He'd greeted me with his typical, heart-stopping smile and I'd leaned in to kiss him before I'd even realized I was in motion.
 He'd pulled back, but his expression at least wasn't reproachful.
 I wanted to force the issue, wanted it so badly I could feel the desire bubbling inside me, but even more than my natural shyness, the thought of him pulling away again, this time in disgust, was too much to contemplate.
 Once we got to school, I'd found the rampant gossip had subsided to a dull rumble, but the few undecided votes had come down solidly on the side of everyone else.
 Some people hated me for using Brandon, others hated me for playing Alec, while a small, but decidedly upwardly-mobile group disliked me for achieving not just one, but both of the conquests they'd been dreaming of since grade school.
 In the end, it didn't really matter why everyone disliked me.
 Still, only the fact that Alec's pack closed ranks around me kept the situation from becoming unbearable.
 Biology went better than it had since my first day in Sanctuary, largely because Alec seemed to have developed a postdoctorate knowledge of Biology.

That is our fate.
 That is our reason.
 Do you understand?”
 Harruq’s fingers traced the hilts of his new swords.
 He knew what his brother asked.
 He had killed before, but this was different.
 This was a complete surrender to the murderer within.
 He thought of his vow to Velixar, and also to his brother.
 Obedience.
 Loyalty.

I sat up, lacing the vest over the thin material of my blouse, and slid on my shoes to join him.
 “It’s dawn,” I complained.
 “And good morning, sunshine,” Steed called from atop a large, black stallion.
 The beast’s nostrils flared, breath steaming in the cool morning air.
 Two more of the animals pawed in the distance behind him.
 Steed chirped a whistle and they walked forward, the slim, muscular one moving to stand beside Chevelle as a mammoth crossed in front of me and knelt.
 I drew in a startled breath at the sheer size and nearness of it.
 Steed shot me a mischievous wink.
 “Well?” I was speechless, mouth agape.
 The thing seemed as large and black as a starless night.

Zoë is a softball pitcher too.
 She was the ace of her eight and under team.
 The season just ended a few weeks ago.
 For a project in her second grade class, she wrote and illustrated a book, which her teacher bound, entitled The Fast Friendly Pitcher’s Bad Remembering Day.
 I suppose if I live another thirty years, my eyes will still mist when I think of my girl as the fast friendly pitcher.
 University of Arizona, whom I count as my team since I taught there for several years, is leading University of Hawaii when we leave, on account of a book signing.
 My friend Alan, with whom I’ve partnered for a lot of book signings, likes to hound me about a remark I once made, “There’s no such thing as a bad signing.” Well, by now I’ll admit that there is such a thing.
 But most often, even if you don’t sell many books, interesting stuff happens.
 And you never can tell when you’ll get blessed.
 Or challenged.

It’s a blend, is all.
 We keep it in a tiny capsule in our cheek and when we need it…” She chomped her teeth together with a click, the look surprisingly feral.
 And then she smiled, her face melting back into something very near adorable as she held a finger to her lips, protecting the secret.
 “Old family recipe, you see.
 My mother left a diary.” She was thoughtful for a moment.
 “Ah, what a thing, a mother’s diary.” Ruby went silent for too long and I wondered if she would be returning to this one-sided conversation any time soon.
 Her eyes flicked back to me.
 “It was very fortunate for me she’d kept a journal, you see, for I would have no fairy knowledge without it.” I felt my brows draw together and tried to smooth my face.
 “No, don’t feel bad for me.
 With you in such a position.” I didn’t know what she meant exactly, but she continued, “And my dear brother has been there for me all along, helping me with the elf parts.” She kept talking as she leaned forward, seemingly unaware I’d not spoken a word in response.

I didn't really want to.
 Not when I'd just discovered I had more studying to do than was humanly possible.
 Still, Mrs. Campbell had always been super nice, if equally stern, and there was only ten more minutes of class left.
 Besides, I'd been so intrigued by the sight of Alec drawing that I wanted to see him like that again.
 If he could take such joy in the creation process, maybe he wasn't as bad as he seemed.
 The only way to know for sure was to see him with all of the masks off again.
 "Sure, I'd love to.
 Mrs. North again?"
 I ignored the spate of nasty looks shot my way, gathered my books, accepted the bundle of papers, and hurried off to the stairs.
 It was later than last time, so unless I was quick the bell was going to ring before I made it back down the stairs.

I suspected a prowler had clubbed her and swiped her few items of jewelry.
 But she managed a goofy smile and mumbled that she must’ve fallen, and getting up had seemed too hard to bother with.
 An ambulance carted her away.
 At the hospital, a nurse tapped her spine.
 The lab found meningitis.
 The only doctor who would talk to me gave her lousy odds.
 When she rallied, they took her to an isolation ward, to sequester her for months.
 At sixteen, some law or regulation wouldn’t allow me to live without an adult in the home.
 So I told the school I was staying with my aunt and uncle and told my aunt I was staying with Eric and Sylvia.
 In truth, Eric moved in with me.

A friend once asked me, "Do you think we can grow as much emotionally without having a child as we can with one?"
 All I could say was that my kids taught me how to love and, at twenty-six and twenty-three, they’re still teaching me.
 And with Zoë on her way, I found myself noticing people on sidewalks or in restaurants, imagining their lives and sending them good wishes, sometimes prayers.
 More often than before, I noticed hummingbirds, horizons, occotillos.
 Spring was the most glorious in years.
 I was feeling more all the time.
 In 1945, the year I was born, my grandma, Mary Durham Garfield, wrote this poem:
 LIVING MONUMENTS Far rather would I pass away And leave a noble son of mine Whom I had taught to love the fine, The just and honest, in his day To serve the world with courage bold, Than have my life on granite told.
 I’d rather feel when death is near That in my children I shall live.
 No monument of stone can give Me greater glory, year by year, Than sons and daughters going on In truth and honor, when I’m gone.

Preventive Diplomacy, Peace Making and Peace Building
 The answers to the questions regarding national sovereignty and international responsibility will determine the scope of UN preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace building in years to come.
 They must be addressed with a view to evolving valid principles of international law, rather than remaining subject to frequent reversals of public policy by member states based on the short-term impact of the media on current public opinion.
 Granted that a consensus is reached regarding these larger issues of principle, there still will remain immense problems relating to implementation, as illustrated by the recent failure of international intervention in Somalia.
 Whatever may be the limits placed on the UN’s mandate for action, it is clear that it cannot carry out that mandate effectively under the current constraints imposed on it by member states through indecisiveness, narrowly defined interests and lack of political commitment.
 Once again the inherent weaknesses in the structure of the UN organization impact negatively on its capacity to perform the tasks rightfully allotted to it.
 The absence of a unified chain of command for national forces placed under UN command – culminating in the outright refusal of field forces to follow the commands of UN field staff, inadequate training and equipping of both military staff and fighting units, poor coordination between field units from different countries and between member states and UN headquarters – and a failure to vest sufficient authority in the UN Secretary General are among the most blatant weaknesses of the present system.
 Substantive measures are needed to strengthen the UN’s capabilities to handle crises.
 First and foremost, the position of the Secretary General, who now has the diplomatic status equal to that of a prime minister of a member state, should be upgraded to that of a head of state, with full authority over the forces placed under his command by member states to carry out the decisions of the Security Council.
 Problems of control over the armed forces of member states argue for the constitution of a standing international military force, as described in the previous section of this report.

I was just about to ask who we were going to ride with, more as a way of changing the subject than anything else, when movement off to my right answered the question.
 "Alec!"
 The last thing I was expecting out of Rachel was for her to all but run towards Alec with her arms out as if expecting a hug.
 Even so, that was less surprising than the fact that Alec accepted the hug, turning slightly to the side to receive her, but still reaching out with his left arm to pull her in close, albeit only briefly.
 "You didn't think I'd forget, did you?"
 "Not forget, no, just maybe be a little late."
 As abruptly as that, the interplay between the two siblings ended, leaving an uncomfortable silence as odd as the affection from a moment before.
 We walked to Alec's car in silence, the pair of them apparently lost in their own thoughts, and me wondering why Alec had agreed to give me a ride home.
 I wasn't enough of a car aficionado to recognize the vehicle other than the fact that it was a matte gray and had the kind of smooth, exotic lines all of the high-end vehicles seemed to be striving for right now.
 Rachel slipped in the backseat while I was still wondering how this seemingly low-profile ride matched up against Brandon's Mustang.

I remembered how long a thousand years had seemed to me before I planned on spending it in a prison.
 Ruby walked in and I snapped the book shut, positive I shouldn’t have taken it from her table without permission.
 One glance at her stifled reaction and I knew I’d not be able to ask her about what I’d read.
 “Sleep well?” she asked.
 “Oh,” I started, my voice hoarse.
 She handed me a glass of water, which she smoothly traded for the book.
 “Dreams,” I complained.
 She smiled as she sat on the bed beside me.
 “Some seek out the breath.
 They say it is foresight.” “Foresight?” She nodded.

 We were making him just like what he called me.

 But it went wrong.
 I yelled at Qurrah to stop, and I think he wanted to, but he kept shrieking more of that curse.
 Then he…”
 Harruq rubbed his eyes and refused to meet Aurelia’s gaze.
 “And then Qurrah removed the spells that kept him from talking and moving.
 He screamed and screamed and he just, he just…‌he tore off his own face.

Doi’van could be just as much of a danger as help.
 Rodregas had to admit though, that in the little time he had dealt with him, he kind of liked the big guy.
 It looked like Audrian was going to argue, but Rodregas just cut him off and stated, “Very well, you two may travel with me, but let’s get on the road.
 Audrian, make sure you and the other two do not forget your oaths.
 I will expect no one to know that we head for the Northern Coast.” Audrian looked like he was going to say something.
 Rodregas thought the loss of the Hellborn did not bother him, but the beautiful half AElfin maiden was another matter.
 However, her point about how she put them in danger clearly made him hesitate.
 Rodregas just headed for the wagon and got it going.
 With a last confused look from Rodregas, Audrian and the other two headed back towards the nearest town.
 The three talked little as they traveled.

Generally there are a whole host of dominants who want to become the alpha.
 This would usually turn into a real dominance fight, with the other two doing their very best to kill him before turning on each other to fight over the spoils."
 "That's terrible."
 Her nod was sad.
 "I told you he was special.
 All of that hard-won civilization tends to flake and chip away when we're that close to our beast.
 Alec always does what's right though.
 No matter what it costs him personally."
 Dom's words were timely.
 Before hearing them I would've watched Alec's near-stillness with unconcern, but now, seeing the way Jasmin and Isaac split their attention between Alec and the wolves they'd just pulled off of him, I could nearly see the effort he was exerting to shove aside the instincts demanding the death of the wolves who'd marked him, who'd questioned his supremacy.

 Whatever meager survival instincts I had left chose that moment to finally kick in, and I felt my knees begin to give way.
 Rachel let out a high-pitched sound that had all of the surprise of a squeal, but none of the excitement.
 Apparently Alec knew how to interpret it.
 He turned back and caught me again before I could hit the ground.
 "There isn't anything to worry about now.
 Go ahead and catch your breath."
 As pleasant as it was to be in his arms again, I was starting to worry he'd get tired of it.
 I pushed him away as soon as I was reasonably confident my knees would support me.
 "What's going on?

Apparently, everyone in the dungeon is following me,” he said with a chuckle.
 “You saw them?” asked Doi’van.
 “Not exactly” he said.
 “I saw movement a few times.
 I just thought it might be them.
 I did not know for sure,” he explained.
 Doi’van asked Imeralda, “Did you know they were tracking us?” “No, I had no clue.” she said looking embarrassed.
 She then added, “I am not really a great tracker.
 I mean, our Paladin was easy enough to find but tracking Dire Cats through the forest, that would require true skill.” “But you did not sense them at all?” asked the Hellborn again.
 “No,” she shook her head.

The snake had wrapped around his neck and was squeezing.
 I gripped my knife but stopped when the creature snickered from the ground.
 “I wouldn't do that if I were you,” it said.
 “That wouldn't be wise.” “Why?” I demanded.
 “It wouldn't be right to help Seth?” It hissed in laughter.
 “No, half-ling.
 If you haven't realized it yet, we change our shapes.
 Your friend already hurt himself learning that.” Seth wasn't looking so good.
 He was bent over and was grabbing at his neck.
 I then realized that the snake was now a smaller brown colored snake and had its whole body wrapped completely around his neck.

The horses edged closer to the creek, splashing along the muddy bank and then the shallows of the water.
 Silt and cold water sprayed my face as we ran.
 I wondered if this was what it felt like to fly like the fairies.
 We followed the creek until it turned west and we kept north, slowing to a walk.
 I tried to catch my breath.
 Steed was watching me, smiling appreciatively, and I realized I was wearing a huge grin.
 And about three pounds of mud.
 The slower pace gave me time to take everything in.
 The ground had leveled off again, clearing to open meadows of low grass and a few scattered trees.
 Large gray rocks dotted the landscape.

Then again all of Monday had flown by, not just the school portion of the day, so it really shouldn't have been a surprise today was doing likewise.
 After Spanish, Jasmin had escorted me to Mrs. Campbell's class.
 Telling her I wasn't going to be able to help out at the lab anymore had been one of the harder things I'd ever done, but she'd been surprisingly understanding.
 We'd scheduled my makeup test for the next day and I'd left with the sneaking suspicion she'd guessed more about what was really going on in Sanctuary than either pack would've liked.
 I'd been busy contemplating what Mrs. Campbell might have really figured out as we left the building, only to have Jasmin interrupt my musings with an apology of all things.
 She didn't get into specifics, and it was obvious she was still worried about the coming showdown with Brandon, but I was pretty sure she really was sorry.
 It didn't make us best friends and she was still an enigma, but it was a start.
 It even gave me hope maybe Jessica and James might eventually come around.
 I was still reeling in surprise as we walked out to the parking lot and met up with the rest of the pack, or rather the rest of the pack minus Alec.
 He'd shown up several minutes later, looking very satisfied with himself, but obviously unwilling to answer any questions.

It is safe.
 They will not attack again so soon.” “When?” I could hear the worry in my tone, despite his assurance.
 “We will protect you, Frey.” Sure.
 I might have rolled my eyes.
 “We knew they were following before.
 Our mistake was in assuming they meant a physical attack.
 We will not allow them so close again.” “So they’re still following?” Panic.
 “No.
 Not now.” He paused.
 “They have accomplished what they came for.

Part of the problem is that the spell to activate the magic in the bow is just very different than anything you have probably done before.” Rodregas knew she was speaking the truth.
 He had never thought he was going to be some powerful mage.
 The fact that Doi’van had so easily learned the spell just reminded him of how many times in his life he had failed to have the ability to succeed in things that he really wanted.
 Rodregas’ new body was very gifted, but it was still mortal and some things he would just not be able to do as well as others.
 In some ways this was reassuring, a connection to his past.
 “Can I ask you a question?” she asked.
 Rodregas smiled and said, “of course, what?” “Have you thought of trying to become a sigil warrior?
 You are a very powerful magician now.
 You could probably take one or even two of the greater sigils and still have more power than you had before, and as a warrior the enhancement from the sigil would make you an even more powerful fighter.” Rodregas nodded, “I have thought about it.
 In fact, I am sure given the opportunity that I would take on one of the greater or several of the lesser sigils.

She said it clearly expecting him not to have anything.
 Rodregas did, have a bow.
 He had two very nice bows wrapped up in the wagon.
 But, while the short swords he handed them were dangerous, they were common and easy to replace.
 On the other hand, the Black Yew bows were rare and powerful.
 He also thought about the chain mail that he had found in Ravenhurr’s wardrobe.
 While it was way too small to fit him it would fit Imeralda just fine.
 But to give this woman he barely knew such fine armor and weapons was not something to do casually.
 It made a lot of sense sitting there on the foothills of the Arida Mountains, worrying about Gobelyn and Dire Cat attacks, but they were a great gift; no one had ever given him such a gift.
 “What?” she asked me “You are looking at me like I asked you for your first born child,” she stated in a surprised voice.

“Even the clumsiest of fighters can slay a sleeping man.”
 “How old were you then?” Velixar asked.
 “Nine,” Qurrah said.
 The man in black shook his head.
 His expression showed there would be no further argument.
 “If you had been mine at the age of nine…‌ my previous apprentice Xelrak held but a shred of your strength.”
 Qurrah straightened at the name.
 “I have heard of Xelrak.
 He toppled the Citadel.”
 Velixar smiled as he remembered a cherished memory.

A few words of magic shifted its colors, better emulating the nearby terrain.
 He tucked his arms underneath him, closed his eyes, and waited for his fate.
 For the longest of time, silence.
 His shoulder pounded with each heartbeat; his chest screamed with each breath.
 Colors swam across his eyes.
 His ears, incredibly sensitive even compared to other elves, strained for the sound of approaching dead.
 He heard nothing but a strange ringing inside his skull.
 It seemed he had put more distance between them than he first thought.
 A footstep fell beside his head.
 His heart and lungs halted.

Black Lung fashioned alchemy, friends, at least once, in that small studio, over a period of 72 straight hours without sleep, so the story goes.
 They laid down 43 minutes of catalytic reverb love.
 Some of you understand.
 (And, an aside: they did not feel it necessary to include that one song on the LP by the drummer.
 An uncommon display of wisdom for the times but a good thing.
 Skippy could no more sing or write a song than fly.)
 Listen to “Blues for Wendy Ward.” Listen to “In Real Time Nothing Happens.”  Listen to “A Marriage of Rue” or “Hayley Mills’ Underpants.”  It’s there.

Seth smiled at me and I felt myself blush.
 It was kind of embarrassing to get knocked out when no one else did.
 “Welcome back, zombie hunter girl,” Seth teased.
 “How long was I out?” I asked, blushing brighter.
 Except I couldn’t pin down the reason why.
 Seth frowned, “I don’t know but it seemed like forever.
 You scared us, Jazell.” “Especially Seth,” Emily piped up behind him.
 “He was the one going crazy to bandage you and was worrying more than the rest of us.” Seth’s face reached a new undiscovered level of red, “I didn’t want to lose a friend.” “Right…” Emily trailed off and smirked at him, wiggling her eyebrows.
 Seth squirmed slightly and avoided her gaze.
 I started to laugh but in morphed into a cough instead.

Alec's established clear dominance to everyone else here, but he still probably couldn't make his gentler rules stick if it weren't for the fact that Isaac backs him almost without question."
 The object of our discussion was currently backing away from James while trying to keep Jessica from circling around behind him.
 I finally realized what I'd always thought of as grace was really an economy of motion.
 It was like he was saving every possible bit of energy because he never knew when he'd find it necessary to burn up his reserves in a blaze of violence.
 Even as I watched, he spun around, plucking Jessica out of the air, grabbing her by the head mid-leap as she sought to find purchase on this throat.
 He tried to spin back around to meet James' rush, but the smaller hybrid knocked him down with a crash.
 Isaac and Jasmin were there in a blink, tearing the other two wolves off of Alec before the conflict could turn deadly.
 I couldn't breathe until the dust settled, and Alec rolled back up to his feet, dripping blood from a large gash in his side.
 Dominic heard my sudden gasp and reached over to reassure me.
 "He's okay.

“That is our last name.”
 Harruq nodded.
 “Aurelia showed me.
 T, u, n, she said.
 And then this sword here has our name…‌kind of.”
 Qurrah stared at the name, thinking.
 “He was an elf,” he said.
 “I guess it is possible he was our father, although I feel it more likely a coincidence.
 Our mother was intelligent, at least for an orc, but was she smart enough to leave us clues within our own names?”
 “Well, he’s dead now, so we’ll never know,” Harruq said, tossing the blade onto the floor.

"Don't talk to me like that!"
 "You shouted at me!"
 "You deserved it."
 She glared at him, trying to wrench her arm free.
 "You're hurting me."
 "Maybe that will remind you not to talk back to me."
 He released her with a slight shove and turned to stalk off.
 Marie's anger dissolved into pain, and she hurried to her room to hide her tears.
 She and Davis had been betrothed for just over five weeks, and during the last couple of weeks he'd lost his temper with her twice.
 Three times counting tonight.

It was the human children, especially the poor and the destitute, that Harruq sought.
 Of course, none would be out playing, not with so many dead and missing.
 He would need to take different measures.
 Not far from their home, a ratty building operated throughout the night.
 It was Maggie’s Place, half tavern and half orphanage.
 Maggie enjoyed the free labor and the ability to rant and slap her orphan workers without fear of reprisal while still maintaining the image of a heart of gold to her regulars.
 The tavern filled the first floor, while the orphanage and a few modest rooms for rent composed the second.
 Harruq stepped into the alley beside the tavern and looked up.
 A window.
 Perfect.

The half-orc continued his charge, engaging the two elves behind.
 They struck as one, their swords aiming for vitals high and low.
 Harruq knew he could not block both, so he accepted a thrust curving to the side of his armor, grinning darkly.
 As the sword punched through the enchanted leather, the half-orc cut his adversary’s throat, using that same swing to parry the other attack away.
 The remaining elf swore as his eyes grew red and watery.
 He backed away from the half-orc, his sword held defensively before him.
 “What demon magic is this?” he asked.
 “Mine,” said Qurrah.
 And then blood poured out from the face of the lone elf.
 The eyeballs hit the ground before the dead body did.

“He collapsed at the very top.
 I cast a spell upon his throat, filling it with ice.
 I watched him die and then I left that disgusting place forever.”
 “You were a worthy apprentice,” Velixar said.
 “Especially to learn such a spell on your own.
 Your master was blind.”
 “He was weakened,” Qurrah said.
 “Even the clumsiest of fighters can slay a sleeping man.”
 “How old were you then?” Velixar asked.
 “Nine,” Qurrah said.

He smiled.
 "You might have a hard time explaining that."
 Taking her face in his hands, he wiped her cheeks with his thumbs.
 "We'll try again tomorrow, OK?"
 "OK." "I need to go get dressed now--I have to go to work."
 "To work?"
 "Yeah.
 Come on--I'll make you some breakfast, and you'll feel better."
 He took her hand and led her back to the house.
 Her fear had returned.

He followed them, wincing as some ended in dried smears of red upon the grass.
 Others led far past the others.
 They ended at once in an enormous pool of blood, leaving the town a somber image in the distance.
 Chasing them the whole while were twin sets of tracks, one of enormous weight, the other light as a feather.
 “Every one of them,” he said, his hand clutching his bow so tight his knuckles were whiter than the moon.
 “They slaughtered even those that fled.
 Yet there are no corpses.”
 The corpses had been taken.
 Or made to walk again.
 “The man with infinite faces,” Dieredon concluded.

You've been mooning over her for weeks.
 You've got her now, but at what cost?
 This isn't open to discussion.
 We're taking her back to Brandon and asking for leniency."
 In an effort to see better, Rachel and I had moved slightly to the side.
 Alec reached back without looking and moved us directly behind him.
 It wasn't until his arm brushed me that I realized he was shaking ever so slightly himself.
 "There's only one way you're going to touch her, James.
 Are you really ready to take that step?"
 I felt shivers run down me as I realized just how easily everything could boil over into deadly violence.

He made vague shrug that could be taken either way.
 Let her think that was it, he thought.
 It was a whole lot better than the truth.
 Aurelia, however, seemed none too pleased.
 She twirled her staff again.
 “You might be surprised, orcyboy, but I could beat you in a spar.”
 Harruq scoffed.
 “You have no chance,” he said.
 “First to three hits,” the elf said, taking a few steps back.
 “Very well,” Harruq said, drawing his swords in his gigantic arms.

I had nowhere to go.
 A pain throbbed deep in my chest.
 Instinct pushing me, I ran for the clearing where I’d learned with Chevelle.
 He was there, waiting for me.
 The pain in my chest dulled a little.
 Or maybe it was only overwhelmed by a new pressure.
 I crossed to him slowly.
 Junnie was all I’d had since I came here and now she was gone.
 For a hundred years, she’d be gone.
 I wanted nothing more of Fannie.

Bits of bone ripped out from his undead army; femurs, fingers, ribs, and teeth flew into the sky in a deadly assault.
 The elves broke formation as the barrage approached.
 The first ten, however, were too close to have hope.
 Bone shredded wings and scattered feathers.
 The elves that were alive when their horses landed died by the clawing hands of rotted flesh.
 Dieredon looped in the sky, his confidence shaken at the sight of so many of his dying friends.
 He fired arrows three at a time, his quiver never approaching empty.
 He ordered Sonowin lower, shouting out the command as another barrage of bone pelted four more elves to their deaths.
 Skimming above the darkness, Dieredon fired volley after volley behind him.
 When they were past the undead, he pulled Sonowin high into the air to observe the battlefield.

I can’t tell you how much I owe that girl.” Toni teaches nursing at Cuesta College.
 She knows most everything about nutrition and raising kids.
 Before Cliff and I go out to slug golf balls into the trees, Toni and I talk in the kitchen.
 After a wandering conversation about food, kids and baseball somehow leads to spiritual matters, Toni mentions that she has always supposed people turn to God for comfort.
 What I don’t know about people in general could probably fill all the world’s libraries.
 But I can offer that I have turned to God at various times for a variety of reasons.
 In hopes of gaining understanding.
 To lessen my likelihood of hurting people.
 Out of fear.
 On account of worries about my kids.

I started college and rented an apartment with Kenny Niedermeyer who was suffering more than any of us over Eric’s death, since the car was his and Sylvia blamed him.
 She would call and scream “Murderer!” and accuse him of stealing the twenty dollars Eric took with him that day.
 Here's something she wrote and sent him: Jingle for Rope Jumpers Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear, Eric's dead.
 They pushed him, and they beat him and they smashed him in the head.
 He gurgled and he growled, he suffered and he bled.
 Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear, Eric's dead.
 Jump Michael, Jump Kenneth, Jump Edward
 Bob Williams often hung around our apartment.
 About half way through the fall semester, President Kennedy got bushwhacked.
 I was so used to good people dying, I didn’t take it as hard as some did.

So, we went at it, like I say, like a couple of hamsters in heat.
 That was freshman year.
 That was while I was starting to play everywhere around town—I was like almost famous, you know.
 Locally.
 Dickinson was there for me, and the gigs started happening and, I had this cheerleader girlfriend, with thighs like hell-roosters, hard, and a great little butt.
 Life was good.
 Classes, shit man, how could anyone concentrate on classes with that going on?
 Most of my teachers hated me anyway, you know, rock and roll, devil’s music, my hair was longer than most of my classmates, I insisted on wearing these combat boots, even in summer when sweating in them was like wearing a swamp on each foot, and I had attitude, of course.
 Rock and roll attitude.
 I was unassailable, untouchable.

I'll keep my cell phone with me all the time, and I made them promise to fly me back no questions asked if it became necessary."
 I stifled a laugh at the idea of Mom making a twelve-hour flight back to the US because I stubbed my toe, and instead tried to interject even more sincerity into my voice.
 "I'll be fine, Mom.
 I even promise to stay out of trouble.
 Have a safe flight."
 I stared at the cell phone for several seconds before looking up at Alec, who was just putting a cell phone that could have been the twin to the one I was holding away.
 "You redirected our calls?"
 "Correct.
 That's what Isaac was doing in the kitchen after your mom left.
 I thought it might come to this, so I had him bring along some of his toys.

Doi’van responded, “We don’t have time for me to learn to read.
 You should spend time practicing with these Grimoires.
 It makes no sense to teach me to read when we are likely to see battle too soon for it to be helpful.” Doi’van’s voice, which was always deep, seemed to have gone down several octaves, such that the earth almost seemed to vibrate.
 Somehow, while the conversation on magic Grimoires had been of interest to him, the idea of learning to read seemed to terrify him.
 Rodregas knew the feeling of wanting something so much that you are afraid to accept it when offered, for fear of failing.
 “Well,” Rodregas said, “I think it might come in handy to have you able to read.
 And if we survive the summer and are holed up here all winter, you might be able to start reading some of these books by then.
 I fear that I am not a very good teacher, but I have managed to teach a few soldiers over the years who wanted to learn.” At their nod Rodregas added, “After our noon meal, let’s plan on making it book time.
 We don’t have a decent lamp to read by, so we will have to do it during the day.
 We can start by teaching each other any basic magic we know.

Because it was built directly on and out of the very bedrock of the Earth, knocking down the fortress walls was not an option for an opposing army.
 Like the stone of the farmhouse, the stone construction of the Cathedral had been enchanted by Nymphs of the Earth.
 It was said that the ley lines were tapped to provide magical protections as great as the physical.
 The Cathedral’s defenses gave it the reputation as one of the most impenetrable fortress in the Eastern Realms.
 Of course, Rodregas thought what could not be taken by force, could be easily taken by politics and fear.
 Once through both the huge gates, Rodregas, Doi’van and Imeralda came into full view of the Great Cathedral of the Heavens.
 The Cathedral served as both fortress and a temple to the Celestial Gods, and its thick walls were a balance of the practical and the artistic.
 Its towering white walls were adorned with statues and engravings.
 Above the ground floor were huge stained glass windows and arches and on the heights were a series of small towers and domes.
 Rodregas had forgotten how striking the building was and all three stood to admire it for a long moment before moving forward into the inner courtyard.

 "But it looks terrific.

 He finally met her eyes.
 Marie was intrigued by the look in his eyes.

“I know you felt they were not a danger, but to walk up and take the food from two Dire Cats?
 That is just asking to be killed.” Her voice was unusually high pitched and she was shaking her head in disbelief.
 “The Dire Bear must have been living in the cellar,” said Doi’van.
 “I bet they actually had to go in and kill it there.
 We probably did not hear the battle because it was underground.
 They probably dragged it out after.
 It is said that Dire meat makes you strong.
 Not sure if that is true though.” His voice, in contrast to Imeralda’s, sounded completely normal.
 “Don’t you care that he did something so stupid?” asked Imeralda.
 “Well,” Doi’van replied slowly, “the cats are obviously connected to him due to his Celestial lion essence.

Jim – I just found out that Liz has feelings for me.
 And why the hell was I the last person on the planet to find out?
 Johnny – I think it’s because you ate lead paint as a child.
 Eugene – I’d have to agree with Johnny, lead paint isn’t good for you.
 Jim – You knew that Elizabeth felt something for me, and you didn’t say anything, what kind of friend are you?
 Johnny – Maybe he’s Elizabeth’s friend more than he’s your friend.
 If that’s the case he might have wanted to spare her from a lifetime of living with you.
 Jim – What do you know about it?
 Johnny – I’ve lived with you for a lifetime.
 Nobody should have to go through that.

“We will be able to eat, not well, but enough to live.”
 “If you say so,” Harruq said.
 “Good luck with your, uh, studies.
 I have a wall to finish building.”
 “Stay safe,” Qurrah said, offering a small wave as his brother trudged north.
 When he was gone, the smaller half-orc slipped back into the shed, removed a false floorboard, and grasped a small pouch containing various herbs, bones, and knives.
 Reaching back in again, he took out an object wrapped in sackcloth and soaked in blood.
 A knife in hand, he opened the pouch and closed his eyes.
 His mind attuned, he carved into the remains of a man’s heart.

“I watched that wretched bully succumb to madness from the disease carried by an undead rat.
 He took something I made for my brother, and I made him pay dearly for it.”
 The man in black nodded, going over the memory in his mind.
 “Could be darker, though,” he said.
 “You need not use memories, but they are easier to project.
 Any thought can be sent to those who slumber.
 After you have practiced, we will try with images you created on your own.”
 The half-orc pulled his robes around him and looked back to the city.
 “When will we assault Woodhaven?” he asked.
 Velixar’s face was an unmoving stone.

What I mean is that his grades have fallen from bad to worse.
 I got a call from the school the other day, they informed me that he has been playing hooky often as of late.
 He even seems to be angrier than usual.
 Jim – I’ve noticed that he’s been in a worse mood than normal, but what do you want me to do about it?
 He doesn’t like me any more than he likes the rest of the world.
 I can’t think of anything I can really do for him.
 Art – Maybe not, maybe not.
 He may hate us all for all eternity, but I’m going to try anyway.
 I can’t just let him waste away like this.
 I’ll do my best by him.

Rick had planned to go to the office for a while the next morning, but his friend Dirk called to challenge him to a couple of games of racquetball.
 "Didn't wake you up, did I?"
 Dirk asked as they warmed up.
 "No--I was in bed reading the paper."
 "I was in bed too--and desperately needed to get out.
 Thanks for the rescue."
 Rick shook his head.
 Dirk, at 28 three years younger than Rick, was as leery of marriage as Rick, but for different reasons.
 He liked having a variety of women to choose from, frequently juggled more than one relationship--if you could call them that--at once, and sometimes seemed to enjoy getting caught at it so that he could put his charm to a real test.
 "I ran into Kim the other day."

She started to wipe her face with it but then stopped.
 Rick frowned as she stared at it.
 "What's wrong?"
 She went to the bathroom for some tissue.
 "Marie?"
 Rick called after her, standing up.
 He started to follow her, but she returned seconds later.
 "What's wrong?"
 "I don't want to use your handkerchief.
 I want to keep it and take it home with me.

Sumo Assassin kicks ass!
 And I’ll thank you not to call it stupid.
 Eugene – It’s the dumbest concept for a comic book ever.
 A Sumo wrestler who fights for the forces of good as a vigilante by killing bad guys, and also making some money while he’s at it.
 And his sidekick, Toothpick…what a dork, Toothpick is like the most useless sidekick ever.
 Jim – You just fear the mad sumo skills.
 And it’s Skinny, Sumo Assassin’s sidekick is named Skinny.
 You also forgot about the sumo-mobile, anybody who drives a steam roller with a built in jet engine has my loyalty for life.
 Besides Skinny has great super abilities, he can slip into places that Sumo can’t go.
 Not to mention he’s a master of disguise, he can speak 12 languages fluently and women dig him because he is a master on the dance-floor.

Seth!” I turned around and waved.
 Emily was running over with Jason on her heels.
 She slowed down and hugged me tight.
 Jason slapped Seth on the back and bent over to catch his breath.
 “Hey, where were you guys?” I asked.
 “We were looking around to see if it was safe,” Emily said.
 “We thought you two were doing the same.” She put her hands on her hips.
 “I guess not.” “Are you going to get mad at me?” I pouted.
 She play punched me in the arm.
 “No, I'll let it slide.” She winked at me.

Rodregas could not help but think about how out of his depth he was trying to interfere with the ritual ceremony.
 However, as he forced the beautiful woman forward, the woman whose name he had refused to learn, he knew he was indeed going to try.
 “I will do it this time,” Rodregas thought to himself, “This time I will not choose my survival over others.” His life was not worth living if he did nothing again; he wanted to feel at least a small measure of being the man he had been raised to be.
 “Celestial Gods, please let my life be worth something in death, if not in life,” he prayed quietly.
 Captain Poir and Rodregas carefully put the two prisoners in the middle of their circles, and then stepped out.
 They each picked up small wooden clubs.
 Dale and Junnit stood across from the two of them holding matching clubs.
 The ceremony required the prisoners to stay in each circle unbound.
 The job of the guards was to remain outside the circle but make sure that the prisoners stayed inside.
 Metal would interfere with the magic so the guards held simple wooden clubs and wore only linen clothes with no metal fastenings.

"I love you."
 "I love you too."
 They were quiet for a few minutes.
 "Rick," Marie finally began, "maybe I should wait another day."
 He didn't respond right away.
 "It won't be any easier tomorrow.
 And I can't promise I'll be able to stop myself if we start-start kissing again."
 He was right.
 And she didn't think she'd stop him even knowing that they would end up making love.
 Half an hour later Marie sat up.

A call to the officer confirmed we were on for 6 pm that night.
 I was instructed to call Ashley around 6 pm and tell her I would meet her as soon as I could get out of the house, and that I would call her when I left it.
 I prepared myself emotionally for another unpredictable evening.
 I was told to meet the officers at a different location behind a nearby grocery store near the loading dock and trash bins.
 I arrived promptly, eager to get this thing done, and was immediately disappointed to learn that there would be a delay getting the crew together as they had just busted an Ecstasy dealer and part of the crew was stuck hauling, booking and questioning him.
 I was irritated as they wired me up in anticipation of the bust.
 The officers then recorded my call to Ashley where I told her my wife had me watching the kids and unavailable until she returned, so I’d call her in a while.
 I was buying an unknown amount of time while keeping Ashley and Steve on the hook.
 So while I am standing in the lot wired up, not able to call my wife, not able to go anyplace myself, some of the officers take orders for a hamburger run!
 I am now beyond irritated, as their lackadaisical attitude could equal another disappointment and a setback for the mission to get my son on with his life and out of a possible prison sentence.

Confident, perhaps, but not foolish.
 Don’t die on me, brother, for I need you more than ever.”
 “Yeah, I know,” Harruq said, growing quiet.
 The subject of Qurrah’s experiments always made him uneasy.
 “This time there will be a slight difference,” Qurrah said.
 “What’s that?”
 The half-orc shook his head.
 “Not now.
 Another time I will explain.”
 The two grew quiet, and they stared at the fire as the time passed.

We were teenagers and we had these other guys, girls, coming up to us, asking about Dickinson and what I meant by “hoodoo on the bloody muddy” or some shit, something they heard on the album.
 It was weird.
 But, you know, I was kind of lost at that time—this was right before Lor came into my life—and I had all these groupies, all these chicks, and I’d ball them, right?, but really I’d be thinking about the music, about what’s next, musically, about soloing, about getting my axe to sound like a sax.
 I was way gone on the music, man, and it just shoved everything out of me, everything else.
 I didn’t know then, that I was unraveling, like an old sweater.
 I mean, I loved the chicks, you know, I loved them.
 But, they knew I was nowhere man, after we’d do it and I’d be lying there, I’d be a million miles away and they’d get this sad look.
 In the morning they’d be all like, let’s go to Barksdale’s for breakfast, and, well, I was using some speed at the time and my appetite was nil.
 So, they’d go off and I’d pick up the guitar.
 That’s just the way I was then.

The sky was turning a dark gray when she walked into the garden.
 Grace, their cook, would be getting up soon.
 Her father liked to have a cup of coffee as soon as he woke up.
 Her mother usually got up to have breakfast with him unless it was raining.
 She said she couldn’t drag herself out of bed when it was so gloomy.
 Marie decided she’d ask Grace to make her a waffle this morning.
 She’d like cherries and whipped cream on it.
 She’d go shopping with her mother and maybe have lunch in town.
 After lunch she’d come home to take a nap.
 The house would be hot in the afternoon.

One after another the deft strokes came in, and one after another Antonil batted them away using the methodical style that had helped him rise to his place at the top of the Neldaren army.
 His opponent, a young elf whose swordplay was raw compared to most of his brethren, tried to give him no reprieve.
 The guard captain didn’t falter in the slightest.
 “You sacrifice planning and thought for sheer speed and reflexes,” he said, his breathing steady and practiced.
 He assumed the elf spoke the human tongue, and the sudden killing lunge proved him correct.
 Antonil pulled his head back, the point stopping just shy of drawing blood.
 An upward cut took the blade from the elf’s hand.
 Antonil’s sword looped around, thrust forward, and buried deep inside flesh.
 The elf fell, gasping for air from the fatal wound.
 Blood pooled below him.

The horse neighed and dove, spurred on by the sight of its own kind falling in death.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 “Behind you, master,” Qurrah said.
 He hurried the words of a spell as Velixar turned.
 An incorporeal hand shot from Qurrah’s own, flying across the battlefield to where an elf dove toward them, arrows flashing two at a time in the starlight.
 The hand struck the elf in the chest, freezing flesh and eviscerating his insides with ice.
 The flying horse banked upward as its master fell limp into the fog.
 “Beautiful, Qurrah,” Velixar said, bloodlust burning in his red eyes.
 His precious undead were being massacred.

The straggly grass, kept just barely alive by the nearly non-existent rain and infrequent watering by some anonymous grounds keeper, had been torn up.
 Large patches of reddish dirt had been exposed and the ground was scarred by gouges that looked like they'd been made by some kind of farm machinery except for being so irregular.
 My eyes were momentarily pulled back to the ground.
 Something about the gouges was tickling the back of my mind.
 Had I seen something like that before?
 Hiking maybe?
 Only I could count the number of hikes I'd actually participated in on one hand.
 Surely something like that would've stayed with me.
 Someone gasped as the crowd shifted around, distracting me from my half-formed suspicions.
 I looked over at the exterior wall of the school and felt my jaw drop.

I’d been unable to generate magic on demand so he’d started lunging at me with weapons, sticks, fire, forcing me to respond to protect myself.
 After each attack, he would come right back at me and if I tried to repeat a tactic for defense, he would overpower my magic and push me to find a new maneuver.
 I was beat, winded, drained.
 “Mount up,” he announced.
 When I started to climb on my horse, the horse shot off like an arrow, almost knocking me to the ground.
 I glared at Chevelle’s back, but he was already galloping away.
 I reached out with magic, drawing Steed’s head around to press him back to me, climbed up, and clicked my heels hard to catch Chevelle.
 He was riding too fast again and I was not looking forward to the day, sure it would be worse than the already miserable morning.
 I rode up beside him, planning a snide remark about the trick, but was distracted by a black stone in his hand.
 It was odd-shaped and just smaller than my balled fist.

He was coming in carefully, shield up, sword in position.
 Rodregas made up his mind not to underestimate him despite being severely wounded.
 Rodregas struggled back up and spread his feet wide for balance and locked his legs straight to try to keep them from buckling under him.
 He felt cold and knew he was losing blood fast.
 Rodregas knew that this was probably it.
 They had gambled and lost, there were just too many of them.
 But he did not want to die without taking out the Immortal Guards first.
 If he killed the slavers and the guards, there was a good chance that the slaves could escape.
 If Rodregas and his group died without taking the slavers and guards out, then they would have died in vain.
 Rodregas hoped Imeralda would get away.

The computer is an instrument and a catalyst that can stimulate creation of employment and self-employment opportunities in virtually every field – from farming, fishing and textile designing to lean manufacturing, financial services, bio-informatics and genetic engineering.
 While the application of computers has already been extended to all these fields, there has not yet been a systematic effort to assess the employment potential that can be tapped by fully extending and accelerating this movement.
 The recent initiative in India to establish knowledge centres in every Indian village by 2007 is one example of a pioneering effort to harness ICT as a means to catalyze a whole range of on-farm and off-farm rural activities, which will inevitably translate into more and higher productivity and greater employment generation.
 These centres can be utilized to deliver technological expertise to upgrade farm yields, vocational training and education, purchasing and marketing information to raise incomes.
 The experience of India also shows that bridging the digital divide helps to bridge the gender divide in the area of knowledge and skill-intensive work.
 As the construction of rural roads acts as a stimulus to agricultural development of isolated communities by connecting them with sources of inputs and markets in the outer world, ICT can be a catalyst for stimulating the entire gamut of economic activities in rural communities throughout the developing world.
 At the other end of the spectrum, ICT is opening up unparalleled opportunities for self-employment and new business creation for the educated.
 Today more than 50 per cent of American workers utilize computers in their work.
 The growth of the World Wide Web has given rise to on-line global markets in which individuals can bid for a broad range of projects involving activities such as research, translation, technical writing, proofreading, desktop publishing, and business consulting.
 A new publication identifies a few hundred self-employment opportunities of this kind.

 "She's really nice.

 He waited for her to add, "If I'm still here."
 When she didn't, he released a slow sigh of relief.
 "OK.  You probably won't be so nervous about it next time."
 She smiled, joining him on the sofa.
 "I might even use garlic again.
 But I have to admit that I sneaked upstairs to brush my teeth after we ate."

Rodregas did not understand fully what Jordaan meant but he suddenly added, “Then, if Imeralda is bonded to me, she will always try to keep her connection with me?” He asked a question, but he thought he already knew the answer.
 Jordaan nodded.
 “She will love others, but she is bonded to you for all time, until one of you dies.” Rodregas sat quietly, stunned by the news.
 No more words passed between the two until Jordaan was about to leave.
 “Do you know where the weapons are from the Immortal Guards?
 We are going to need them if we are going to do better during our next encounter.” Rodregas was getting his mind back to business; the news that he would never truly be separated from Imeralda revived his spirit.
 “Oh, we… took the weapons as salvage.
 It has helped to pay for your healing and equipping of the people you rescued.
 As their rescuers you were, of course, responsible for getting them properly outfitted and on their way back to their homes.” Rodregas sat shocked for a moment and then he just exploded.
 “WHAT!

He spoke too quietly for me to make out exactly what was being said.
 It seemed like he was giving orders though, and that they weren't being received very well.
 A few minutes later Alec bundled me into the back seat of an unfamiliar car, which rapidly filled up as first Jasmin, Isaac and the tiny Hispanic girl arrived.
 Jasmin completely ignored me as she climbed into the car; Isaac gave me a polite, if somewhat cool nod.
 The Hispanic girl gave me an honest-to-goodness smile as she slipped behind the steering wheel and started the engine.
 In what was one of the most thoughtful things that'd happened all night, she turned the heater on full as she pulled out of the driveway.
 The drive into town, and then back out to my house was quiet, but luckily didn't take as long as normal.
 Apparently her timidness stopped well short of observing the speed limit.
 Alec, Isaac, and Jasmin all jumped out of the car as soon as my house was in sight.
 The car was still doing at least twenty miles per hour when they bailed.

I could see the curved end of his lip, which met he was smiling.
 “Do we ever know, Jazell?” “Good point.” *** Emily couldn't sleep.
 She kept closing her eyes but it didn't seem like a time to sleep.
 She wanted to do something, just to occupy her busy mind.
 She watched a strange creature fly over to her tree and hook itself on a branch near her.
 It looked like a butterfly with only one set of wings, which were transparent and seemed to glow.
 It had a tail and curled around the branch so it could rest its middle.
 Emily watched it and its beauty; she didn't think that something this pretty could be found in a place so dark and full of death.
 “Hello,” it said.
 Emily propped herself up on her elbow.

Protect who they want.” “They don’t control them?” “No, silly.
 No one can control animals.” She cocked an eyebrow at me speculatively.
 “But—” “Okay, well, sure, you can lead an animal.
 You can turn your horse and guide him on the path, but that is simply pushing their heads and encouraging them with the click of your heels.
 You can’t make them choose to take you; it just doesn’t work that way.
 You can’t get into an animal’s mind and make them behave the way you want them to.” “But the dogs… wolves… follow them.
 They had them do a demonstration and—” “No, Frey.
 The wolves do not follow the elves.
 The wolves protect them by choice.” “By choice?” “Yes.
 And I have seen them tear an elf apart as quickly as defend them.” I shivered.

Back in North Beach after midnight, a couple of Finochio’s transvestite dancers waylaid us.
 The four of us loitered under streetlamps listening to their pitch about the glories of San Francisco.
 The museums, the opera, the food.
 They were perfect gentlemen.
 On our way home, strung out on fatigue and more coffee, I babbled about how, guided by Kerouac, we had risen above routine, learned to outrun the sheep and phonies and to create our own destiny.
 “We’re well on our way to being Supermen,” I boasted.
 I prophesied that as soon as we got released from high school and were no longer branded juveniles, life would turn into a banquet.
 Eric mostly sat quiet.
 As we sped past the strawberry fields of Santa Maria, he said, “You know what they say about there’s no free lunch?” “Yeah.” “Suppose they’re right.
 Then who’s going to pay for the banquet, for all this freedom?”

I’m a professional rodeo clown.
 Greg: that sounds both exciting and dangerous.
 Cindy:  it’s both, it’s a fantastic adrenaline rush, the bull and the crowds all watching you, it’s like being an action hero or a firefighter or something.
 Greg:  Sounds like you really love what you do, that’s fantastic, I wish I were so lucky.
 Cindy:  really, what do you do?
 Greg:  Nothing so romantic, I happen to be a grill jock for micky d’s.

 Have you ever met him?
 Greg:  Who?

Do you understand me?”
 “Yeah, I do,” Harruq said.
 “So when do we know when to start?”
 _Kill them all!_
 Both shot to their feet as Velixar’s bellowing command rolled over the town.
 “Which way do we go?” Harruq asked.
 “Follow me,” Qurrah said.
 The two rushed past the elaborate elven homes toward the sound of combat.
 They kept to the back alleys, and because of this, they met their first target: three elves fleeing toward them, hoping to use the lesser-known pathways to avoid the overwhelming numbers of their opponent.
 “Bring them down,” the necromancer said.

"Oh.
 Yes."
 He followed her outside.
 "When you think you've gone far enough, yell.
 If you're lost, I'll find you."
 She nodded and started to turn to go into the garden.
 But Rick caught her hand, stopping her.
 He gazed down at her.
 "I hope you get back, Marie.
 But if you do, I'll miss you."

Plus I was high half the time, all the time.

He kissed her lips softly.
 "Do you know what my life was like before you came?
 I'd dated half the women in Boston, I think, trying to find one that I wanted to spend my life with.
 I was really lonely, but I'd just about given up.
 It just wasn't worth the effort."
 He squeezed her hands.
 "And then you walked into my garden.
 We spent time together, got to know each other .

Rodregas decided it was now or never if he was going to ask Doi’van of his past.
 “So,” he said, “was your mother in a place of strong magic when she was pregnant with you?” He held his breath, worried that his question might be impolite.
 But Doi’van’s smile continued and he nodded, “Yes, my mother is a princess of the Orqui clans of the Farisa across the inland sea.
 There the Orqui are torn between following the Celestials and the Daemon Lords of the Infernal Realm.
 My family is of the Orrghirrlida tribe that follows the Celestials.
 Of course, the Daemon Lords love to tempt all those of Celestial blood.
 I was born a bastard from an illicit affair of such a temptation.
 While the shape my father had taken had been fair, I came out, well let’s just say my paternity was not in question.” “This is an old game among my people,” Doi’van continued “and while I suffered much in my own clan, they kept me in the palace and I grew to adulthood in its strong magical confines and to my full strength.” “So,” Imeralda broke in, “You are of both Infernal and Celestial blood?” Doi’van seemed hesitant to answer for a moment but after a long pause said, “Yes, but most choose not to see it that way.
 You are either Hellborn or not.
 After I grew to manhood, I decided my true place was among one of the other clans, one that follows the lordship of the Hellborn.” He spoke this very slowly each deep rumble of his tone dragged out.

Right?” “Right.” We stopped at the door to the lobby, looked back and saw Johnny’s convertible turn the corner.
 Then we hoisted our suitcases and double-timed up the road.
 We stayed at the cheapest motel, about a half-mile north.
 In the morning we hitchhiked to Fort Lauderdale.
 This was during college spring break, a sad time to be in that town if you were eighteen, on a peanut butter budget, and didn’t belong to a fraternity.
 The girls were taken.
 The parties were private, the bars off limits to minors.
 We spent our evenings with the fellow who had picked us and invited us to flop with him and his roommates.
 The three of them were carpenters, down from New York and New Jersey for the winter.
 Bobby Casso was one of them.

I nearly protested, but Alec was right, it would take an actual order to get Donovan to slow down, and two days was probably pushing it.
 Donovan somehow managed to respectfully circumvent any order he thought prevented him from taking adequate care of Alec's family.
 "Tell me about Christmas at the Paige house."
 I blinked a couple of times.
 The progress I'd made lately notwithstanding, I half expected the question to drive me into a panic attack.
 Apparently Alec's presence was proof against a second near attack today.
 "I don't know.
 We always used to do the standard kind of stuff.
 Presents, eggnog and the Christmas story.
 Usually Dad made us breakfast Christmas morning and then we'd drive out of the city later in the day and go sledding.

"Just not me.” He turned up the sound on the TV and flipped to the western.
 Marie watched as a beautiful woman listened to a man's heart and then went home to dinner with her family and then kissed her husband when they were alone.
 It was all so real!
 It looked as if they lived in a small western town and were a real family.
 "Are that woman and man really married?"
 she whispered.
 "No.
 She's married to the show's producer, I think.
 It's her fourth marriage."
 "Fourth!"

I'd wanted to come downstairs and talk to him, but wouldn't have dreamt of just saying it outright.
 Maybe it was the natural high I got simply from being around him.
 Alec's smile was brief, but it felt like the first one I'd seen since he'd been forced to save me.
 I couldn't blame him for being worried about how this was going to further strain already tense relations with Brandon's pack.
 Still, the transforming expression made me realize just how badly I'd missed his other face, the one that wasn't stern and serious all of the time.
 "No, you're not bothering me in the slightest.
 Jasmin or Isaac either one could easily keep watch.
 Our sense of smell and hearing are good enough that it's all but impossible for even other wolves to catch us unawares.
 They're here more in the role of bodyguards.
 If Brandon's people do show up, it'll likely take all three of us to get you away safely."

The air was so dry I could nearly feel it pulling the moisture out of my body as we started around the school towards where Britney had parked her car.
 As we reached the west side of the building, the high-pitched growl of a performance engine tore a hole in the relative silence.
 The edge of the student parking lot was just barely in view now, but it was enough to see the source of the noise.
 A tiny figure barely recognizable as Rachel, was walking towards a dark-blue bullet bike, which had just roared to life.
 We had to walk several more steps before I recognized the leather-clad, dark-haired figure on the bike as Alec.
 My feet must have unconsciously slowed because Britney was now several steps ahead of me and looking back impatiently.
 I tried to catch up, but Alec chose that moment to look up and stare in our direction.
 He was quite a ways away, and his lovely eyes were covered by a pair of sunglasses, but I somehow knew he was looking at me.
 He handed Rachel a helmet but continued to look at us, at me, while she put it on.
 I was moving again, but my pulse sped up as Rachel grabbed a hold of her brother and swung her leg over the pillion seat on the bike.

Outside of the camp, I uncovered blood and drag marks.
 The imp had killed what appeared to be three of the camp’s inhabitants and dragged them off, likely by stringer and tow.
 Whatever was there had run away because of the attack, and recently.
 I questioned my sister again—she’d had some time to cool down—but she was no help.
 I immediately knew she had not even considered that whatever she had been so interested in was still out here, probably close.
 I didn’t clue her in.
 After a little more time there, I acted as if I’d lost interest and headed home.
 Tomorrow, I will follow the tracks.
 I will find whoever was there and solve the mystery of their rudimentary tools and strange huts.
 I yawned.

He halted instantly, despite there being no way she was strong enough to stop him.
 I doubted she had enough grip strength to slow even me down.
 "Don't be angry with me, Alec.
 You're all I have left."
 "I'm not angry, Mother, but you're wrong.
 You have much more left than just me."
 She shook her head with a youthful smile.
 "Such a good boy."
 Rachel, tears coursing down her face, stormed off as Alec pulled his mother's door shut behind us.
 I started to follow her, but Alec recaptured my hand in his.

Not that we talked to anyone, but they were aware of us, apparently.
 And, of course, there were binoculars trained on Lor, as she walked around in the nude.
 (laughs)  But, man, that was my only comfort, my woman, her body, her sweet, enveloping body.
 She suckled me like I was a child—she has these breasts, well, sorry—anyway, we did a lot of fucking, you know, the kind you do until you cry yourself to sleep.
 We fucked in the cold water of the river which ran right below the cabin, standing up, man, cold as hell, I held her up and entered her right there, in front of God and everybody.
 It was heaven.
 It was hell.
 I was empty man, as empty as a skull.
 And Lor brought me back.
 Love.

"But it's such a beautiful day.
 Why don't we go out for lunch and then see a movie?"
 "Wonderful!"
 They went to a small restaurant for soup and sandwiches.
 "This is good," she said after swallowing a spoonful of clam chowder.
 "Do you have it in 1927?"
 "Yes--it's one of my favorites."
 "What don't you have?"
 She laughed.
 "Well, we don't have shoe soup, but I imagine that you don't either."

He dismounted effortlessly and pulled me from my horse and into the building in a few quick steps, closing the door behind us.
 It was dark inside, his fingers lingering on my arm.
 I felt him shift, waving a hand as several lanterns around the main room lit, giving off a soft glow.
 He indicated a door on the rear wall.
 “Your room.” I drew back my hood, nodding.
 “I have some business to take care of before we move on.” Move on?
 So this wasn’t our destination.
 Or did he mean back to the village?
 He continued, apparently not noticing my perplexed expression as my mind ran through a list of possible scenarios.
 “The pouch from the vault.

“Ugh, cat pee.” I thought I might hurl.
 How much of that healing crap had I drunk?
 I heaved once and Steed shook beneath me with laughter.
 I glanced up to find him looking at Chevelle.
 For some reason it angered me, even though I knew Steed wasn’t laughing at him.
 I was talking again, without regard to thought.
 “His mother died, too.
 We killed her.” It sounded so matter-of-fact, my head bobbing along with the words.
 I couldn’t seem to stop.
 My mouth opened to speak once more but I was suddenly swept up, off Steed’s lap and into Chevelle’s arms.

"You weren't kidding when you said this place was special."
 Alec smiled and then wrapped me in a light blanket.
 The heat had finally relented slightly.
 Not enough to actually make it comfortable, but this high up it was actually a little chilly.
 If I hadn't spent the last several weeks living in the air-conditioned haven of Alec's house, the cooler temperatures at the top of the mountain would almost have made the trip worthwhile all by themselves.
 "I've been wanting to bring you up here for a while.
 I used to come up here a lot when I was younger.
 It was kind of an escape after everyone started gaining their wolf form.
 We were all so closely matched sometimes it seemed like we were always scuffling to establish who was dominant."
 He'd sunk down beside me while he was talking, resting with his hands behind his head so he could look up at the few thinly-stretched clouds.

“Goodbye Harruq,” she said.
 The elf was almost past the trees when he spoke.
 “Hey, Aurelia?”
 “Yes, Harruq?” she said, turning to face him.
 “Have you ever killed?”
 She paused, and then ever so slightly nodded.
 The two parted without another word.

 “What did you learn this time?” Dieredon asked as Aurelia arrived at their designated spot in the forest.

With public opinion widely divided over the best course of action, it is necessary to win back the understanding, support and endorsement of the population for an alternative programme which the major parties and social groups can back.
 This requires educating the public to understand both the costs and benefits involved in any reform strategy, the trade-offs between immediate advantages and immediate sacrifices required to establish a new and stable equilibrium.
 3.Economic strategy must be balanced: A market economy can be introduced gradually or step-wise, but it cannot be introduced in a fragmentary or piecemeal manner.
 Deregulation of prices was the most prominent feature of the strategy in most countries, because it was the easiest to implement.
 But under conditions of shortages in economies dominated by huge monopolistic enterprises, price deregulation led to skyrocketing prices and spiralling inflation.
 A market flourishes only when several essential conditions are met – freedom of pricing, freedom of entry and exit from industry, free flow of information, unrestricted movement of goods and services, competition between enterprises, control of monopolies, and private ownership of property.
 The entire package of free market practices must be implemented hand in hand, otherwise it does not work.
 Freeing pricing without first regulating or dismantling monopolies, promoting privatization of land and enterprises, ensuring free flow of goods, and establishing wholesale markets and multiple distribution out lets lead to speculation, soaring prices, hoarding and falling production.
 Historically, the free market evolved over centuries in conditions of surplus production and stable currency, neither of which exist in Eastern Europe today.
 Efforts to accelerate the development of the market will have first of all to meet the political, legal, social and economic conditions historically required for its creation.

In the industrial countries, the phenomena of jobless growth coupled with persistently high rates of youth unemployment and of chronic unemployment among the poorer sections will not be eradicated by even the most optimistic rates of economic expansion or mere incremental adjustments within the context of present attitudes and policies.
 Although the problem has been aggravated by a variety of short- and medium-term factors whose effects will gradually dissipate over time – defence cuts, recession, East European economic crisis, German reunification, etc.
 – the present job crisis among Western nations is largely structural in nature.
 Although conditions vary from country to country, the crisis impacts most heavily on the unskilled, young people, urban poor, ethnic minorities and older workers.
 Specific programmes to effect structural changes will have to be introduced in order to ensure a fair opportunity to all, especially minority youth, to lead economically active lives.
 It is in this context that the European Union, the United States and other Western governments have been considering ambitious proposals for addressing this issue.
 The Australian government has unveiled a $4.6 billion jobs package to reduce unemployment from 10 per cent to 5 per cent by the end of the decade by encouraging training for the young, the unskilled and the long-term unemployed.
 Recently the OECD has presented the main planks of an employment strategy to stimulate economic growth in the industrial nations, make labour markets more flexible, increase productivity, and revamp employment and unemployment security provisions.
 The relative success of the US economy in creating jobs during the past decade has prompted other countries to emphasize the importance of policies to increase the flexibility of wage rates and bring down the price of labour by reductions in the statutory minimum wage.
 The main effect of this policy is likely to be a movement of jobs between nations, however, not a significant increase in the total number of jobs available.

Qurrah watched as if immune to the sound.
 He was so much smaller than Harruq, his slender body wrapped in rags, thin flesh clinging to bone.
 Yet he was unafraid.
 Shame and embarrassment burned in Harruq’s cheeks.
 He towered over his brother, his hands beefy and arms muscular.
 Nothing should scare him.
 He was supposed to be Qurrah’s protector, not the other way around.
 “Where can we climb?” Harruq asked, hoping to get his mind off the skulls.
 “There,” Qurrah pointed.
 A narrow set of stairs climbed to the parapet and Harruq led the way.

It is particularly acute in agriculture.
 Hoarding, speculation by traders, regional shortages and price variations have been aggravated by the absence of alternative systems of distribution to replace the old centralized food procurement system.
 Privately operated commodity exchanges have sprung up to handle wholesale transactions.
 But unfamiliarity with such institutions, and the lack of a firm legal basis for enforcement of contracts and a system of grading and inspection to guarantee the quality of produce traded, have kept most buyers and sellers away.
 A mechanism is needed to insure distribution of food to deficit areas, to guarantee farmers an indexed floor price for foodgrains under conditions of unstable, soaring prices, and to establish and maintain a national buffer stock against emergency.
 The Indian Food Corporation and Indian National Dairy Development Board, the autonomous marketing boards in the UK, and the US Commodity Credit Corporation are model institutions from which the Eastern Europeans need to borrow, adapt and innovate to suit the conditions of vast food-deficit nations.
 Simple commercial systems need to be created to support commerce and industry as well – even such basic systems as telephone listings of sources of products and services that are found in every telephone directory in the West.
 If trade is to develop between private enter prises, credit checking agencies and collection agencies need to be established.
 For enterprises which do not qualify or cannot compete for limited bank resources, financial institutions offering hire purchase or leasing of industrial and consumer goods are necessary.
 The market reforms were expected to lead to a rapid proliferation of new small enterprises, but most of those created so far are engaged only in trading and retail sales.

The tingle of shape shifter power was as strong as I'd ever felt it, jumping from multiple sources, arcing around me as it unsuccessfully looked for a place to ground out.
 For the first time, I was able to accurately pick out the individual signatures that made it up.
 Jess was off to the left, white hot with mixed anger and fear, stabilized only by the cool, controlled pillar of power that was Isaac.
 Jasmin almost hummed under my fingertips like barely-leashed violence, while my other hand drank from the still pond that was Dominic, her mere presence feeding me comfort.
 I'd just finished identifying the raging beast to the right as James, when Brandon stepped into the light.
 He looked like some kind of pagan god, smeared all over with blood, an uneven circle drawn on his chest, filled with sharp, angry lines that didn't mean anything to me, but which made the wolves around me tense and growl.
 "While I appreciate the sentiment, it really is far too late to secure absolution by bringing me the girl."
 His voice had changed, becoming deeper and harsher, with elements that didn't sound like they could come from any human throat.
 He stepped forward, and I felt my chest seize up.
 The transformation I'd sensed the beginnings of at the dance had run its course now and any question as to why someone as cultured as Brandon would associate with a near-psychopath like Vincent was put to rest.

“Qurrah doesn’t know I’m doing this.”
 Aurelia sighed and set the book down beside her.
 “Why don’t you tell him about me?
 Well?
 Why not?”
 “I’m just embarrassed, all right,” he finally muttered.
 “Embarrassed?
 Why?”
 “Qurrah’s smart, can read and everything.

The next morning, after they had finished Morning Prayer, Rodregas said, “Alright, are you two ready for a little fighting practice?” At their nod he added, “It is always good to start with the basics.
 I thought we would go over some fighting forms.
 Are you two familiar with learning forms, also known as Kata?” he asked.
 He was expecting Imeralda to shake her head but was a little surprised that Doi’van did as well.
 He clearly knew how to fight.
 Rodregas started to explain, “Forms are a series of motions that mock fighting, but also give you an opportunity to work on balance and to visualize and understand your actions and responses to different fighting situations.
 While strength and speed are important for any kind of fighting whether it is hand-to-hand or swords fighting, good technique is all about balance and center of gravity.
 What you want to learn is to keep your center low and your balance strong even when you are tired and exhausted.” Doi’van had his normal interested expression, but Imeralda looked unconvinced.
 “Ok,” he said, “time for an example.
 Imeralda stand tall,” Rodregas stated.

“I’ve killed.”
 He eyed Aurelia, desperately wishing to know what she thought yet unable to figure out why he even cared.
 He thought he saw pity in her eyes, perhaps compassion.
 But there was a hardness there, a doubting that made him wonder just how much of him she truly knew.
 “Tell me of the first time,” she said.
 He shook his head.
 “Not today.
 Maybe some other session, if I feel I can.”
 They both stood, Aurelia stepping away while Harruq stretched and popped his back.
 “Goodbye Harruq,” she said.

He'd been thinking about Marie's life in 1927--just as he had been when she'd walked into his garden and his life.
 He was the key.
 Rick squeezed his eyes shut, thinking about television and microwaves and airplanes.
 When he opened them, most of the fog had evaporated.
 Everything seemed normal.
 The water was gurgling from the frog's mouth.
 Jumping up, he ran inside and up the stairs.
 "Marie?"
 he called, knocking on her door.
 "Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

More and more vines appeared, covering the half-orc’s arms and legs with green.
 They lifted him into the air, his boots dangling two feet above the ground.
 Harruq bellowed like a bull caught in a cage.
 He jerked against his restraints but they held firm.
 Aurelia calmly walked over, raised her staff, and tapped him on the chest.
 “Three,” she said.
 The half-orc roared his protest.
 Aurelia swung the staff with all her strength.
 The end cracked against Harruq’s cheek.
 Blood shot from his mouth.

"Mistress Paige, is there anything I can get you?
 Something to eat perhaps?
 Or if you'd rather, I can show you to the theater."
 I chopped off a hysterical burst of laughter just before it managed to emerge full force and totally embarrass me.
 Of course Alec had a theater in his house.
 Probably a pool and a gym too.
 Along with a half-dozen other amenities I'd never think of, but that the ultra-rich simply couldn't do without.
 I pulled my erratic, pointless thoughts back into a compact, nearly sensible ball, and shook my head as I did my best to give him a genuine smile.
 "No thanks.
 I probably won't be hungry for several hours still.

I mean, one of the doctor’s I know, a young guy, a pretty hip cat, he knew my stuff.
 He wanted to talk about the music, nothing but the music.
 I mean, he was disguising it as a mental exam, but it was mostly curiosity, you know, I was the closest thing to a celebrity he’d ever treated.
 We talked about The Highsteppers, Sam the Sham, I mean, he knew them all, all the old blues guys even.
 He wanted stories.
 I don’t think he was speeding my recovery.

Not a single sign of life decorated the streets or moved in the fields.
 He prayed to Celestia he was wrong, but his heart knew he wasn’t.
 He found nothing to convince him otherwise as he quickly scanned the village.
 He found many homes left wide open, yet none answered him when he called inside.
 Everywhere, staining the earth a dark crimson, there was blood.
 “It is as I feared,” he whispered to the night.
 He stood, took his bow off his shoulder, and then thoroughly searched the town.
 He found no trace of life barring a few rats that fed off the now unguarded remnants of food.
 Several homes, those with their doors smashed open, had gore smeared on their floors.
 One pained Dieredon’s heart greatly; amid a great red circle on a wooden floor laid a small, bloodstained doll.

“Quick thinking, Mister Summit.” The large man grinned and I was in no doubt they were old friends.
 Chevelle stepped forward then, eager.
 I had a feeling he’d been itching for this the way I’d been itching to burn Ruby.
 Steed smiled in acceptance, but not the same smile he’d given his last opponent.
 They stood across from each other and readied themselves.
 Both tensed but neither took the low, wide stance previously used.
 As their eyes fixed on one another, I felt myself, and Ruby beside me, lean forward in anticipation of action.
 Both men went taut, their muscles corded, jaws clenched tight, determined stares focusing only on each other.
 I saw nothing happen but knew there must be something, some unseen force causing them pain, draining them.
 I couldn’t look away but stammered to Ruby, “What’s happening?” “They are trying to overpower one another.” I could hear the pleasure in her voice.

Rodregas wondered if Doi’van had lost his balance because he had been trying to fly instead of walk.
 As they stepped out of the room of Infernal sigils and carefully closed the door behind them, Doi‘van still seemed unsteady and Rodregas wondered if his own experiences had prepared him more naturally for this.
 Rodregas had changed bodies before.
 “Doi’van, why don’t you sit down and rest for a second?
 I will check on Imeralda,” Doi’van nodded his thanks and sank down on the floor.
 Doi’van seemed to need to think more than rest, but either way Rodregas made sure he was ok and then went to check on Imeralda.
 He hoped she had not touched the One Tree.
 As he approached where Imeralda had shown them the door he was dismayed to see only black stone.
 “Damn,” he said quietly.
 He went to the middle where the door had been and was relieved when he was able to step through the invisible but open doorway.

 He's tall and handsome, just like Douglas Fairbanks, and he makes me feel romantic.
 Especially when we dance.

 "Well, I like it when he holds me."
 "And he only holds you when you dance?"
 Rick stopped pretending to eat.

I'd been wrong.
 The floors were a gorgeous marble which drew the eyes to the nearest golden-white wall, and up the elaborate gilded trim towards vaulted ceilings.
 It was like walking into a palace, complete with painted, spun-sugar clouds, and burgundy drapes made out of rich velvet.
 If it wasn't for the press of people pushing me from behind, I probably would've stayed in the front entryway right up until the sound of the orchestra filtered down to me.
 As it was, I only got a few hurried looks before being rushed along with the rest of the students.
 Seeing all of my classmates looking utterly bored as they allowed themselves to be herded through the most amazing building I'd ever seen brought me back to my original train of thought.
 I hadn't actually spent every waking moment thinking about Les Misérables.
 A fair number of those seconds had been spent with Brandon.
 He'd already been picking me up from school every morning and dropping me off most days.
 We now spent every lunch together, and he'd started lingering when he dropped me off.

Jim – I just found out that Liz has feelings for me.
 And why the hell was I the last person on the planet to find out?
 Johnny – I think it’s because you ate lead paint as a child.
 Eugene – I’d have to agree with Johnny, lead paint isn’t good for you.
 Jim – You knew that Elizabeth felt something for me, and you didn’t say anything, what kind of friend are you?
 Johnny – Maybe he’s Elizabeth’s friend more than he’s your friend.
 If that’s the case he might have wanted to spare her from a lifetime of living with you.
 Jim – What do you know about it?
 Johnny – I’ve lived with you for a lifetime.
 Nobody should have to go through that.

I danced with a movie star!"
 "I saw."
 He smiled, stroking a damp tendril of hair from her face.
 "Was it fun?"
 "It was incredible!
 I can't believe I danced with him!"
 "Come sit down for a minute and have a Coke."
 He managed to keep her still for less than five minutes.
 They danced almost non-stop for the next hour and a half, and then Rick declared he'd fall asleep behind the wheel if they didn't leave.
 Marie could have gone on, but about five minutes after getting in the car, she was yawning.

Ignorance and scepticism about new opportunities are characteristic of development at each stage and in every field of activity.
 Information about success stories helps overcome this resistance and spurs people to action.
 Enormous potentials are waiting to catch the attention of the society and take off at this moment.
 Proven technology exists in many fields that await application because people do not know or do not believe that it can be employed successfully.
 Imitation of intensive aquaculture methods commonly employed by farmers in Taiwan and Singapore can raise average fish yields in South Asian, African and Latin American countries 25-fold.
 Advanced methods for micro-nutrient management can double or quadruple fruit and vegetable yields in most developing countries.
 A complete list of proven but untapped technologies and commercial opportunities should be compiled for each country, each region and local area.
 Programmes should be initiated to publicize information about commercialization of agriculture, stimulating industrialization, encouraging self-employment and new business start-ups, improving management practices, etc.
 Role of the media
 Free and well-developed media are vital to democratization and development.

“I can’t hear you.” Emily snapped.
 “I WAS OUT SCOUTING!” he shouted, “Now can you hear me?” “Yes, and now you’ve made me deaf!” Emily yelled back.
 “Why were you out scouting in the first place?” I asked calmly, trying not to shout it out like Emily.
 Seth gripped the handlebars and I knew he was losing his temper.
 “I was being cautious so we didn’t have to worry last night,” He said through gritted teeth.
 He was lying and both of us knew that.
 I glared at him, “Nice story Seth, now what really happened?” He didn’t say anything and he rode ahead to get beside Jason, who was in the lead.
 The park slowly came in view.
 It was a huge grass circle with a small play set in the middle covered in kids.
 The woods surrounded it except for the side that faced the street.

 It didn't tell the date of her death.
 That was odd--he was sure it had been in this section.
 His heart began racing as he scanned those pages.
 There was no mention at all of her death--or of her marriage.
 The only information was her date of birth, the names of her parents and brother, and the general family history.
 He knew that the other information had been there before, and after his mind had completely rejected the impossible--that the print had changed when Marie had stepped from 1927 into 2011 (another impossibility)--he rapidly considered the implications of such an impossibility.
 Maybe the information about the rest of her life wouldn't appear until she returned.
 And maybe she wouldn’t marry Davis when she returned.

She mouthed the words, thank you.
 I nodded in response.
 Jason threw his knife at the troll and it landed in its leg.
 The troll collapsed on the ground and Emily raised her hands in the air.
 The ground rumbled and the troll disappeared in the dirt.
 I ran over to her and hugged her.
 “Thank goodness we found you.” I looked at her pale face and frowned.
 “Are you okay?” She nodded vigorously.
 “Yes, it’s just hard work to use my magic.
 I need a lot of concentration.” We all ducked behind a half-dead tree to escape from the swarms of monsters.

My hair was dark and windblown.
 The bell sleeve of the long white gown hung from my still outstretched arm.
 It was the dream, alive and here.
 The pendant against my chest seemed to glow at my revelation.
 I ran.
 As I raced from the chamber, I couldn’t tell if anyone had even noticed.
 They all appeared to be staring at the speaker but, regardless, I concentrated furiously on not being followed.
 Do not catch me, do not find me, let me go, I was almost chanting in my thoughts.
 Out the building, out of the village, running as fast as I could, I kept thinking it over and over and over.
 I didn’t know where I would go, I just wanted away.

Maybe he really was an undertaker but I doubt it.
 Another man they called “The Banker,” and he really was a banker but he was crooked as a stick.
 They had something on him because he would do whatever my stepfather told him to do.
 I remember going to the bank and walking in or out with bags of cash.
 The “Judge” was actually a Judge and he lived next door.
 He was a nice man.
 I babysat his kids and watched his house while he vacationed, and did some odd jobs for him.
 My stepfather and his associates spoke openly about their various girlfriends and the dual lives they led.
 Dino also had a girlfriend and a separate apartment in which he put her up.
 My brother and I were young and we were afraid of this man so we didn’t disclose what we knew to anyone.

I should have known that Kojas would do anything to get him, and now Seth was gone.
 After he had been taken and Jason had awakened, the faery jerks had scattered.
 Then a light pixie had showed up, the same one who had saved my life a while ago, and led us all the way to her majesty’s place.
 She was apparently the queen but she was nothing like a stuck up royal leader.
 She was more like a warrior who lead Igneeria in the ‘good times.’ She was really nice but when we had met her, I was in an awful mood.
 No one blamed me; I had just watched one of my best friends get beat up and taken right before my eyes.
 Her Majesty said to return in the morning when I would hopefully be in a better mood.
 So Jason, Emily and I walked to her throne room.
 Emily pushed open the door and Queen Crystalla turned to us.
 She wasn’t someone who you’d expect to be named Crystalla.

Rodregas swung his shield aggressively, he hit the man’s sword with his shield and then banged the other man’s shield hard.
 Rodregas’ goal was to see if he could out muscle the man while staying protected by the shield.
 It worked!
 Clearly his opponent, though set for a heavy blow, was not expecting the strength of Rodregas’ bash.
 Still his opponent was too good to fall, even when surprised.
 And even as he half fell backwards he used the momentum to slide down and try to land a blow low under the shield.
 Rodregas had both quickness and strength on his side.
 He blocked the blow with his sword and then bashed down quick and hard multiple times with his shield.
 He thought he heard a bone break.
 Rodregas paused and the knight signaled him as victor with a finger to the Heavens.

 She moaned, letting her head drop back against the roof of the car as he began kissing her neck.
 "I love you, Marie," he whispered, nuzzling her ear.
 He raised his head, wanting to see her face.
 And then he realized that Teri's porch light was on and that she was probably watching to see when she could turn it off.
 Stroking Marie's hair, he pressed a final kiss to her lips.
 "I think we'd better go."

That too.”
 Harruq blushed but let it go.
 “Well, you ready to go, little elfie?” he said, trying act gruff.
 “Of course.” Aurelia retrieved her staff, smiling to herself.
 The offer flattered her more than Harruq could know.
 “Well,” Aurelia said, twirling her staff.
 “Ready for a go?”
 “Oh yeah,” Harruq said, drawing his swords.
 “You’ve got no idea.”
 But she did, and it made her laugh all the more.

Suffice it to say only Dominic has a greater capacity for empathy."
 I wanted to ask what Alec meant, but it was more and more obvious he wasn't going to answer anything he didn't want to.
 We walked in comfortable silence for several minutes before turning off into what I could only assume was the Lilac Room.
 Donovan looked up as we entered the suite.
 "I trust your mother was well, sir?"
 Alec nodded, a short choppy motion that eloquently conveyed his desire not to discuss the matter.
 He turned towards me, only to break off as a cell phone rang.
 "It's for you, probably your mom.
 Pretend you're home, I'll explain once you're finished."
 I almost dropped the phone, and probably wouldn't have managed to figure out how to answer the call in time if he hadn't reached over and pushed the green button for me.

Several people are looking at the creations and acting like they are holding conversations as they move about and look at the exhibit.
 Liz and her mom are speaking apart from the crowd.
 Jim is in the background studying a painting, wearing a trench coat with the hood up some dark sunglasses and a set of Groucho Marx glasses, facing away from Liz and her mother.
 Cleo is smoking, from time to time she lights up a new one.
 Cleo – Your show is going fabulously darling.
 Liz – Yes, I seem to be a hit.
 Cleo – Isn’t it though.
 I imagine that you will be a big star when it is through baby.
 All our years of hard work are finally beginning to pay off.
 Liz – Yes all those years of work are finally paying off.

He'll swing by next week to pick up the shots I think are the most promising, and then he'll see if he can't put the brochure together from that."
 She noticed the suitcases and the empty hangers for the first time.
 "Honey, there isn't any reason to be in such a hurry.
 We haven't really decided to take the job yet, and even if we do, I'm sure we won't be able to arrange a flight for another day or two."
 Right.
 If Alec really had arranged this incredible trip, literally overnight, he'd have her on a plane much faster than anyone else would've believed possible.
 "Mom, we've already gone through every single one of your objections, and they've all been taken care of.
 I'll be fine, the brochure will still be completed on schedule, and the job is as real as it gets.
 The only thing left to do is call them back and accept before they decide to offer it to someone else."
 It obviously hadn't crossed Mom's mind that they might decide to go with someone else.

But if she'd met Rick here, fallen in love with him, and then had to-to go to China or somewhere with him and never seen her family again, would she have done it?
 She hugged her knees, tears flowing down her cheeks.
 She knew without a doubt now that she would have.
 If she could have said good-bye to her family, let them know that she was safe and happy, she would have stayed with Rick.
 She realized now that she hadn't clung to the hope of getting home because she loved and needed and wanted her family and home more than she loved and needed and wanted Rick; she'd clung to that hope because of the feeling that she'd been .

"The mongrels unnerve you a bit?"
 The scorn on the face that the comment belonged to was unnerving.
 I'd seen him several times before, but didn't have a name to go with his aristocratic features.
 "That's enough, Vincent."
 A trace of rebelliousness flared up at Brandon's chastisement, but Vincent buried it so quickly I almost didn't have enough time to classify it before it disappeared.
 Interestingly enough, I could see Cassie out of the corner of my eye, and she didn't look any happier than Vincent.
 The rest of lunch flew by.
 I'd never realized how much fun it could be to belong to a group.
 Things weren't ideal; I'd never met a group with so many inside jokes.
 Half the time I felt like there was an entire conversation being carried on over my head, but sitting next to Brandon left me with such a tingly feeling all along my right side that I didn't really mind.

Another 10 million jobs will be created in downstream agro-industries located in rural areas - in sugar mills, cotton and textile mills, processing units for fruit, fish and silk, and in marketing and distribution - thus serving as a counter-magnet to urban migration.
 Growth of agro-industry will stimulate demand for industrial machinery and services.
 The multiplier effect of skyrocketing rural demand will stimulate demand in a broad range of consumer industries and create an estimated 45 million rural and urban jobs in industry and services.
 Funding for the strategy would come from a mix of public sector and private sector investment.
 The funding requirements are within the range of current five-year projections: 84 per cent of additional planned investment in agriculture and 25 per cent of additional planned expenditure in industry.
 The average cost per additional job is less than $1,000, roughly one-tenth the average cost of jobs in India's private sector and one-hundredth the cost of new jobs in the public sector.
 Implementation of the strategy will require a substantial investment in training of both on-farm and industrial workers, but the plan is based on the recognition that enhancing the skills of the nation's rural work-force will take time and must be done incrementally.
 As the programme gains momentum and rural incomes rise, the demand for industrial products and services will grow, resulting in a shift to greater farm mechanization and gradual movement of more and more workers to non-farm employment.
 Organization is a crucial issue in a country of more than 90 million small farmers.
 The strategy envisions the establishment of several new types of organization to bring together small farmers for processing, marketing and distribution and to promote more active linkages between farmers and the private industrial sector, both Indian and foreign.

While I’m writing all this from notes and memory, I decide to pick up my old hardback of Big Sur.
 I still get moved by Jack Kerouac’s honesty and his pictures of the raw and terrifying beauty of people and things.
 After reading about a drive from Big Sur into Monterrey, I go online and look up pictures of the two real people (to whom the book gives other names) on that drive, Kerouac and Neal Cassady.
 Both men were remarkably handsome, some of God’s finest art, I think.
 Then I remember a character from Ken Kesey’s Sometimes a Great Notion, and I realize that Kesey may have used Neal Cassady, a fellow of wild intellect and passion, and a legendary womanizer, as a prototype for his character Joe Ben.
 Only he revised, changed his life, and made Joe Ben a real hero.
 Remembering that Kesey and Cassady were friends, I look up some dates.
 Sure enough, they met while Kesey was writing that novel, two years before it came out.
 And no doubt he had read Kerouac's novels featuring Cassady, a.k.a.
 Dean Moriarty et al.

 Johnny – Well Eugene’s father’s attorney found some obscure law that said that Gene could never be adopted by anyone while the father was still alive.
 Jim – That’s it?
 Johnny – Yep, the judge ruled in favor of Gene’s father.

Of course, both times before when he'd shouted at her, he'd come to her to-- "Marie?"
 Davis called as he tapped on her door.
 "Darling, I'm sorry.
 Please come out for a minute."
 She went to open the door.
 "You hurt my feelings.
 And you hurt my arm."
 "I'm sorry.
 I'm under a lot of pressure at work, and I took it out on you."
 He took her hand and raised her arm so that he could kiss it where he'd squeezed it.

There was a constant war inside him over what to do with me and I couldn't afford to give up my one advantage.
 He seemed less able to contemplate cutting me out of his life when I was around.
 I planned on playing that card for all it was worth.
 I was staying and that was it.
 Alec sighed, presumably in resignation, and then suddenly my legs were thrown up in front of me as he picked me up with inhuman speed.
 Only the steady pressure of Alec's arm around my waist kept me from screaming, and then I was back on my feet, and being carefully, but firmly shoved through a tangled knot of bodies.
 My shoes had never been intended to allow ankles to withstand that kind of punishment.
 Even just walking had been risky, so it wasn't a surprise when my right foot slipped, and a sharp knife of pain shot through that ankle as it collapsed under me.
 Dealing with blinding agony hadn't ever been my strong point.
 I opened my mouth to scream, only to find that no sound would come out.

CM:  	Tell me about your dad.
 BG: 	Well, you know he played clarinet with a supper-club band called Dick Delisi and the Syncopaters.
 They were fine, really fine.
 And Mr. Delisi came over to the house sometimes to dinner.
 A nice man, even a talented man.
 Could blow a barrelful of sax.
 But, they never talked music, never.
 I would question them about the band, what it was like performing, what particular songs they played.
 They would keep switching the conversation, keep it moving away from music and onto neutral topics like TV shows or the church.
 And, it took me years to figure out what was going on.

“What is it you wish to say to me?” the elf asked, ignoring the flailing hands that pawed at his face.
 “ _Hemorrhage,_ ” the half-orc hissed.
 The elf’s face exploded.
 Qurrah fell over onto his side, breathing as slowly as he could through the blood that filled his throat.
 The dead body of the elf crumpled in front of him, all of his hate-filled features gone from his face except for a single eye.
 The half-orc stared, wondering if his brother was truly dead.
 Darkness crept at the corner of his sight.
 His strength was fading fast, and he had little doubt that if he passed out he would never wake.
 He struggled to lift a single numb hand, then flopped it down on top of the dead elf’s leg.
 Qurrah took as deep a breath as he dared and then spoke the words of a spell.

If either of them slaughters another child, I will see it and put an end to it.”
 Aurelia pulled a few strands of hair away from her mouth and tucked them behind her ear.
 “This seems like a small matter for a scoutmaster to be involved.
 Are you sure you have nothing more important to do?”
 “Murdered human children?” Dieredon shrugged.
 “Let the humans and orcs do as they wish, but when they butcher their young they must be made to suffer.
 You were right to contact me, Aurelia.”
 “I hope so,” Aurelia said.
 “I saw one of the bodies, and what was done to him, those vile carvings…”
 Dieredon kissed her forehead.

Feeling incredibly ungrateful and thoughtless, I limped over to the table and tore open the delicate wrapping paper.
 It was a copy of the latest Les Misérables movie, complete with the score from the most recent Broadway production, and a signed picture of the entire cast.
 Mom still wasn't home by the time it got dark, but I went to bed truly happy for the first time in ages.
 Rachel was the best friend a girl could wish for, and Brandon had come through in spades.
 Chapter 18 I felt my stomach do handsprings as I walked inside the opera house.
 The week had flown by much faster than expected.
 Especially considering how slowly each individual day had dragged along.
 Most of my waking hours had been spent wondering if Saturday night was ever going to arrive.
 My train of thought shattered as I got my first glimpse of the interior of what'd become my own personal Mecca.
 The exterior of the building had been impressive, complete with statues and sculptures reminiscent of an eighteenth-century opera house, but I hadn't expected the illusion to hold once I passed through the enormous, gilded doors.

Recognition of opportunities releases fresh energy and constructive initiative.
 Setting goals to achieve minimum needs ensures that the minimum is the most we will accomplish.
 Seeking to tap the maximum potentials challenges us to strive unceasingly for higher goals.
 The world possesses the technology, resources and organizational abilities needed to eradicate poverty from the globe.
 Positing material constraints becomes a justification for non-action.
 The true constraints are not material, but psychological and social.
 Recognizing the real barriers will help us overcome them.
 Human beings are our most creative, productive and precious resource.
 Human capacity increases the more it is drawn upon.
 It can never be exhausted.

“I don’t understand what Aurelia sees in you,” Dieredon continued.
 “You murdered the children and gave them to your brother.
 You’re the Forest Butcher.
 Admit it so I may kill you.”
 “I will admit no such thing,” Harruq said, his jaw trembling.
 “You’re guessing.”
 “I have also seen your brother meeting the strange man in black of the ever- changing face.
 What is his name, Harruq?
 What is it he offers you?”
 “You’re out of your mind.”

Nor do these agreements, long overdue and greatly welcome, remove the fundamental dangers and questionable legitimacy of these weapons.
 Even without a decision to abandon completely their use under any circumstances, a further drastic reduction to somewhere between 20 and 200 warheads is more than sufficient to meet any security need.
 Immediate steps can, and should, be taken to negotiate reductions to this minimum level.
 The relaxation of tensions has drawn public attention away from this issue and reduced the momentum for progress at the very time when there is the greatest opportunity finally to eliminate this threat completely.
 The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which ensures the military superiority of the nuclear powers over other signatories, is an instance of rule by strength forcibly imposed by the major powers on the rest of the world community in the name of peace.
 It is neither equitable nor justifiable.
 Already, 156 countries have signed the treaty, owing either to coercion or indifference, and the number is expected to increase to 170 out of 179 states by 1995.
 The acceptance of non-proliferation by these countries further delegitimizes the continued possession of nuclear weapons by any country.
 All of the treaty non-signatories can be persuaded to sign in exchange for annihilation of these weapons by those that now possess them.
 Under these circumstances, refusal to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty could be considered sufficient grounds for expulsion from UN membership.

When his eyes returned to mine, he smiled.
 He liked playing with fire.
 And then he shoved the fireball toward me with frightening speed.
 I threw both hands in front of me, palms out, and forced the largest mass I could in response.
 Chevelle flicked his wrist and the flame dodged up and angled back toward me.
 I shook my hands frantically, spitting sharp bullets of heat at it, hoping to break it up.
 But he pulled his hands apart and the thing split, each side curving toward me; there were two now, closing in fast.
 I leapt forward just as they collided where I’d been standing and lost my footing while I watched the fireworks behind me.
 Spinning into a tumble to keep from landing flat on my face, I rolled to my feet, still thrilling from the fire play.
 From magic.

In a number of countries, high levels of unemployment coexist with shortages of particular skills, reflecting significant mismatches between supply and demand for skills.
 The deficiencies in government-operated training programmes can be partially overcome by providing greater incentives to private firms to invest in training new and existing employees.
 Studies have found that a 10 per cent increase in expenditure on training can boost productivity by an average of 3 per cent over two years and by as much as 30 times the cost of training.
 Yet even today, only a relatively small number of companies conduct regular, ongoing training programmes.
 Launch a nationwide public educational programme on the tremendous potential gains in productivity from increased training.
 Support initiatives by providing incentives to intensify training programmes for all employees by every type of commercial and non-commercial institution in order systemati cally to upgrade the technical, vocational, organizational and managerial skills of the workforce.
 10.School-to-work apprenticeship programmes: The transition from school or college to work can be long and difficult.
 Germany's apprenticeship programme equips nearly 70 per cent of all teenagers with employable skills before they enter the workforce.
 Two-thirds of the UK workforce have no vocational or professional qualification, compared with only 25 per cent in Germany.
 There is growing support in the United States for establishment of a national youth apprenticeship training programme that combines classroom schooling with on-the-job skills training to ensure a smooth transition to employment for those who do not pursue higher education.

She turned to reach for a tissue.
 "Please don't make me cry again."
 They went back downstairs and lay on the sofa again.
 They talked quietly until they dozed off and then awoke, talked, and fell asleep again.
 A weak light was filtering into the room when Rick opened his eyes again, his heart heavy.
 In just an hour or so, he'd lose Marie forever.
 Marie opened her eyes to find Rick gazing down at her.
 "Good morning."
 "Morning."
 "I love you."

Nausea can unseat you, can defeat the strongest man.
 And it’s a nausea that is in your blood—your whole body is sick.
 And, you know, looking at it now, I think I was sick like the country was sick.
 I was nauseated for the USA, you dig?
 I took those deaths, that ignominious war, the whole queasy zeitgeist of the times and internalized them.
 And I couldn’t get away, not in a cabin, not in my music, not anywhere, man, because the enemy was me.
 And, dad, anyone who’s ever had that kind of stomach failure, where you feel like your whole system is shutting down on you, knows how bone-deep that kind of pain and fear is.
 This is when I started shooting horse.
 I’m not proud of it.
 You know, I’d always used drugs, to perform, to get up for a performance, to come down afterwards—there were always pills around.

He hugged me like I was made out of fine china, but it was a start.
 The tingling sensation I'd always felt around Brandon was back, stronger than ever.
 Despite the incredibly grave nature of everything that'd happened in the last few hours, I felt mildly euphoric.
 Maybe this was what people were talking about when they said they were buzzed.
 "Maybe they weren't going to kill you.
 I can't say for sure, but they've both killed people before.
 I couldn't take the chance that they weren't just playing around.
 I had to stop them."
 I thought for a moment that my knees were going to collapse on me.
 I carefully reached up and brushed the bandage on his shoulder.

And you have remained outside our village for several days yet vanish with the morning sun.”
 “Have I done something wrong?” Velixar asked.
 Dieredon frowned, noticing the subtle yet constant changes to the man’s facial features.
 His instincts cried out in warning.
 This man was dangerous.
 “Children have been dying in our forest, all found horribly butchered,” Dieredon said.
 “As you can plainly see, I am nowhere near the forest,” Velixar said.
 His voice was calm, disarming.
 Dieredon did not buy it.
 “Give me your name,” he said.

 She hadn't bought a stuffed animal for Rick's t-shirt, so she spread the shirt over a pillow.

 She wished she'd gone to the library today--she'd like to have something to occupy her mind.
 She-- There was a tap at her door.

 "Come in."
 Her mother opened the door.
 "Are you feeling all right?"

I think we should try to understand what led you to this change, a real sea change in the eyes of the public.
 Can you talk a bit about that time?
 BG:  	First, as we’ve discussed, I don’t see that big a change between Memphis and L.A.
 I mean, geographically, yes, Big City vs. hometown, sure.
 But, as for my art, there’s a direct line from Turntable Poison to Rain and Other Distractions.
 There’s a road if you wanna delineate it.
 CM: 	Really?
 That’s what I want to hear about.
 Not just the line between the works but what was going on in your life.
 I mean, stylistically, you did go from blues/psychedelic rock, in the British invasion vein, to soft rock…

All I know is, it’ll make getting expelled and the rest look like kid stuff.” The next day, Saturday, according to Sylvia, he spent reading Heart of Darkness for the second straight time.
 On breaks from the story, he returned to his winnowing.
 He loaded a garbage can with old board games and school papers and gave a couple of pairs of jeans to a neighbor boy.
 He even tossed out the charred and bent pan he used to make popcorn since he had grown tall enough to reach the stovetop.
 That evening, when I called to ask if he wanted to go to the cut-rate movies or shoot pool with Billy and me, he was probably home.
 But Sylvia had gone out with Richard, and nobody answered the phone.
 Billy spent the night at my place.
 We had plans for the next day.
 Billy and I, Eric, and Kenny were going to drive up the coast to Laguna Beach, for the annual sidewalk art festival.
 Billy, like his brother Cliff, had a gift for drawing.

She didn't get into specifics, and it was obvious she was still worried about the coming showdown with Brandon, but I was pretty sure she really was sorry.
 It didn't make us best friends and she was still an enigma, but it was a start.
 It even gave me hope maybe Jessica and James might eventually come around.
 I was still reeling in surprise as we walked out to the parking lot and met up with the rest of the pack, or rather the rest of the pack minus Alec.
 He'd shown up several minutes later, looking very satisfied with himself, but obviously unwilling to answer any questions.
 As we caravanned home, I realized the collection of vehicles carrying us back to Alec's estate probably cost more than my house.
 Donovan had met us at the door and conducted us to the dining room, where Alec and his friends devoured a sizable meal.
 Even back when I'd had a more substantial appetite, I still couldn't have kept up with the wolves.
 Even the girls packed away more food than I would've believed possible for such slender frames.
 I mentally shrugged and added it to the list of shape shifter benefits.

On Sunday morning about nine, I phoned Kenny to tell him Billy was at my house and ask when he meant to pick us up.
 Things weren’t decided yet, he said, because Eddie Carmichael and Mike Beatty wanted to go along, except not to Laguna Beach.
 They wanted to drive to the desert, to the Indio Date Festival, which they claimed was a good party.
 Billy and I didn’t favor the idea of six guys, including big Mike Beatty, riding 150 miles over the mountains and back in Kenny’s mom’s Volkswagen.
 Still, I asked Kenny to call us when the plans were settled.
 He promised to.
 But he didn’t.
 Eric told him not to, I would learn the next day.
 Eric, whom no one recalled having done a single mean act, or said a single mean word, had told Kenny to leave us behind.
 When Kenny asked him to explain, he only insisted he didn’t want Billy or me along.

Rodregas was sore himself.
 Even walking shot pain up his shoulders and into his neck.
 But the men and women in the room looked like they had come off a battle field.
 The majority were covered in bandages stained red with blood.
 Splints holding together broken bones were also in clear evidence.
 At least the enchantment against flying insects seemed to be holding, otherwise it would have been even worse.
 Imeralda led the two men over to a corner where a young man lay; he was unconscious and looked near death.
 From his wounds Rodregas guessed he had been injured during the sword and shield competition.
 To Rodregas’ relief no one was paying them any attention, not even to Doi’van.
 Rodregas and Doi’van did their best to block the view of others as Imeralda gathered the limp pale hand that should have belonged to an old man, not a young one, and slipped the small frog figurine into it.

All that time, all those killings, and this was how he would fail.
 “Karak!” he shouted, all his power fleeing him.
 His undead minions collapsed, their souls released.
 The gates to the abyss opened before his eyes, and he felt the pull on his soul.
 The dark fire already burned.
 He saw the face of his master, and the sick grin there horrified him.
 “I will not die!” he shrieked.
 “I will not die!”
 His flesh burned in fire, his bones blew away as dust on the wind, and only an empty robe remained of the being that was Velixar.
 Yet, still haunting the wind, was his final cry, a promise to the world of Dezrel.

 Her mind was a net, and she cast it further and further out, scanning the rolling hills and the plains beyond.
 “Found him,” she whispered.

 A blue portal ripped through the air before Qurrah, beckoning him.
 He looked through but saw only mists and distorted landscape.
 Seeing nothing to lose, he got to his feet and stepped inside.
 He felt the sensation of traveling a great distance yet his mind insisted he had taken only a single step.
 He could see the orange glow of the great pyre several miles away.

But did he actually think I was human, marrigeable?
 I was incredulous.
 But he was obsessed.
 The moment it slipped from his lips, he became more focused on that than anything else.
 Making me his bride.
 I couldn’t understand.
 He tried to explain.
 “I want you forever.
 I need you, Lizzy.” The yearning in his voice was clear on the last part and I was surprised that I ached for him a little, felt for his pain and need.
 He touched me then and I thought I understood when he continued, “We could be together…” Marriage.

It was too much to process so quickly.
 When Alec took a careful step towards me, all I could think of was that I'd just seen those same eyes hovering above bloodstained fangs.
 I shrank back away from him, and saw his face go from calm to expressionless in a barely detectable flicker.
 I'd opened my mouth, maybe to apologize, or possibly to scream for help, but it snapped shut at Alec's response.
 Moving faster than I would have believed possible, he spun around and fled through the door.
 Between one heartbeat and the next he disappeared into the darkness, letting the door slam shut with enough force that the glass in the ceiling should have come down in a rain of razor-edged shards.
 The flowers closest to me swayed slightly from the force of the vibrations, pulling my gaze towards them.
 I felt my heart skip a couple of times and tears start to flood my eyes as I took in beautiful white petals edged in an amazing shade of purple.

I couldn’t get a foothold.
 “Come now, Freya, you must defend yourself.
 Fight me.
 Stop me.” Snap!
 Snap!
 Snap!
 She was faster now, cracking the whip above me and at each side, moving again and again, closer and closer.
 I had to think of something but my mind could only concentrate on the snap of her whip.
 Her boots splashed in the melted snow again, and I sent the icy water racing up under the material of her skirt to her bare legs.
 Shock crossed her face and I hoped it would buy the time I needed.

Imeralda, her voice dripping scorn, added, “It was only because one of the slaves had family at the local village that we were able to find this refuge.
 Then, no matter how valiant the efforts of healer Durien, he barely kept you two from death’s door.” “So what did I do?” she asked them.
 “I nearly ran myself to exhaustion fetching Jordaan to heal you.
 I was using my own relationship to rescue you, who I have known less than a season.
 And now that all this effort has been done you are going to get mad… mad at the only reason you two are alive to complain at all?
 Well to the Infernal with you.”  With that Imeralda turned and jumped back into the trees.
 The half Nymph’s anger, though not meant to cool the warriors, had that effect as both men stood in shock at Imeralda’s normally calm demeanor.
 Doi’van wilted like a flower without water in the sun; he literally sat down on the ground.
 Rodregas simply sagged as the truth behind the half AElf’s words sank in.
 Jordaan simply stood watching the scene, without his normal expression of cheer.

CM:  	That’s quite a story.
 Ok, that leaves “Goodbye to the Shell,” maybe one of your most controversial songs, one that some folks back in Memphis didn’t take too kindly to, one that is perhaps misunderstood.
 Can you clear it up any?
 BG:  	I’m not even sure what the fuck you’re talking about?
 It’s about leaving Memphis, yeah, so what?
 What’s not to like?
 Who didn’t like it?
 CM:  	Um, well, let’s see, in Sum Times, the review said, “’Goodbye to the Shell’ is the kind of self-satisfied soft-rock that John Denver would be proud of.
 If Gardner hates his past so much why can’t he leave it behind?
 Why does he write, ‘Adult us, be real, don't frighten or gull us, Honest Merchant, Home, Bluff City.’?

See, in a way, I was fortunate.
 I never had to sack groceries at Piggly Wiggly or teach school, or cut lawns.
 Writing songs, I learned early, brought in the bucks.
 And a lot of the talent coming out of Nashville, well, a lot of those guys were singing my stuff.
 See, at that time, everyone wanted to play and sing, but not everyone could write.
 So I wrote.
 And, even if we never performed any of it, which we didn’t, they were my songs, and they were popping up on the radio.
 Sebastian did, “Lemmy Caution’s Incubus,” and I think that was really the start of it.
 That was big for him—he has that voice, you know, like he’s sitting next to you, and it perfectly fit the song.
 God bless him—no slouch at writing songs himself, he really took me under his wing, sort of.

She’s a half-breed.
 How do you feel?” Steed asked.
 “Weird.” “Yes, that’s normal.” “Hot,” I said, unclasping my cloak and tossing it off behind me.
 I swayed.
 “Maybe you should sit down,” he warned.
 That sounded like a good idea.
 “Half-breed?” I asked, unable to form full sentences.
 “Half fairy, half elf.” He sat in a chair as he started to answer and I kept moving past the bench where I intended to land and crawled onto his lap, curling my feet up, knees to my chest.
 His voice seemed mesmerizing as he continued, “Her mother was a fairy from the West.
 Fiery one, her.” I wrapped my arms around my legs, holding my knees tight, and placed my chin there to rest my head.

My mouth opened to speak once more but I was suddenly swept up, off Steed’s lap and into Chevelle’s arms.
 I managed fear for half a second but then lost the feeling to dizziness, followed quickly by only dull numbness.
 Chevelle was laying me on my bed.
 “Stay here.
 It will pass.” His words were gentle now, the anger gone.
 “I’m sorry,” I whispered.
 He didn’t respond.
 He leaned over me to straighten the bedding, his face close to mine.
 I stared at his mouth, wondering briefly what it might taste like.
 I felt a sharp pain and realized I was biting my lip.

He was wonderful, and I loved him with all my heart."
 She paused, smiling as she reached out to touch a lock of Marie's hair.
 "Every time we kissed, I felt it all over."
 Marie's eyes flew to her mother's.
 "Why didn't you marry him?"
 Mrs. Tranton's face sobered.
 "He died.
 He drowned trying to save his little cousin."
 She drew in a deep breath.
 "I believe in strong morals, but for a long time I wished that I had given myself to him.

He will destroy you!” Is Kojas’ rising?
 “Seth, do you have anything?” Emily clicked her pencil.
 Seth shook his head, but Jason spoke up, “He said, ‘The King will rise.’ Then he left.” Emily added one last bullet; Toad Dwarf said to Jason, “The King will rise.” Her list was: Toad dwarf said to Jazell, “He’s rising, he’s rising”.
 Who’s coming and is he important?
 Toad dwarf told Seth, “You won’t stop him, little warrior.” Does this mean he’s powerful?
 Toad dwarf said to Jason, “He will destroy all half-ling.” What does “half-ling” mean?
 Toad dwarf said to Emily, “Kill all you like but Kojas will rise.
 Is Kojas the person they’ve been talking about?
 Who is he?
 Toad dwarf said to Jazell, “The one will rise, the one will rise!

"You've been living with me for a week.
 What do you think?"
 She smiled.
 "One called this week."
 "Did I go out with her?"
 Her smile faded.
 "You should have.
 I don't want to disrupt your life, Rick."
 Briefly he considered trying again to kiss her but instead took a lock of her hair to play with.
 "You haven't disrupted it.

He was in the hall when she opened the door.
 “Morning.” She smiled up at him sleepily.
 “Good morning.” She was wearing only his pajama top and looked unbelievably sexy.
 Drawing her close, he bent his head and kissed her.
 Marie sighed with pleasure as she returned Rick’s kiss.
 She’d never dreamed anything could make her feel this way.
 “Are you hungry?” he asked, kissing the tip of her nose.
 “Starved.”  She hugged him.
 They went downstairs with their arms around each other.
 “Did you make pancakes?” she asked.

One archer continued to fire out the window, believing his companion capable of finishing a single warrior.
 He believed wrong.
 The elf fired only one more shot before Harruq crossed the room.
 The arrow lodged into Harruq’s side, and then Salvation tore through his bow and into flesh.
 A kick sent the remains tumbling out the window.
 The other archer pulled back and fired at point blank range.
 Harruq roared as he felt a sharp pain bite into his neck.
 His mind blanked.
 He dropped his swords.
 His hands closed about something soft.

Regulation’s drummer, poor Gyp Leach, could barely keep time on his Sears drumset, taking lessons after school at Guitar & Drum City, just progressing past a four-four beat.
 But word was spreading about this precocious guitarist who sounded like a coup de foudre, this scrawny, pimply 8th grader with licks like a junkyard dog.
 Buddy Gardner.
 It was Jim Dickinson who dubbed Buddy “Slipshod,” not because Buddy was a sloppy player but because he put together such sloppy groups around him.
 It mattered not to Buddy who was playing behind him.
 He was lost in the ether, playing for his own private gods, letting the Lydian reverberation carry him away, the sound coming from his own self, you see.
 Oh, of course, he knew when the bassist was faking it, or the drummer tripping over himself to keep up, or the rhythm guitarist playing the same three chords over and over, hoping his stroking would be lost in the thunder.
 Buddy knew it, but he didn’t care.
 He was soaring.
 He was making music, Memphis music, as sacred a calling as one could imagine.

“And have you decided to take a greater sigil even it if cost you most of your magic?” Doi’van nodded and said, “Yes, I like to learn magic, but we are on a mission, one that is very important.
 The Immortalists, especially Taiga, must be stopped.
 If we are going to do that I will be of most use as a warrior.
 We have a powerful magic user,” he said with a smile.
 Imeralda smiled back at the complement and the three got back and continued their walk to the Chamber of Sigils.
 CHAPTER 16 TO RAISE A SWORD
 Rodregas was careful to walk with the confidence due of a new knight eager for his awards.
 Doi’van and Imeralda followed two steps behind, both playing the role of faithful servants to the hilt.
 He saw the double, engraved doors ahead of them, a pair of knights on each side of the door.
 The doors were large enough that the three of them could have entered abreast through the threshold and the doors were solid enough, looking as if they were made out of whole trees.

BG: 	I haven’t been stagnant because I’ve been still.
 It’s Buddhist, isn’t it?
 I mean, sitting still while the winds blow.
 Winds of change, winds of creativity.
 Lorelei has taught me much, man, many things I can’t even tell you.
 You’ll get it—you’ll see where it’s all been heading.
 Anyway, Memphis, yeah, it’s still part of that—the signpost on the road.
 Memphis still burbles up through even my most contented piece of songwriting, still smolders underneath it all.
 So many musicians came through Memphis, man, came through, came from.
 Some never got any recognition, yet they fed the stream, they kept the mojo alive.

Surely it would be easier to convince her to stay now that she'd decided not to marry Davis.
 He knew she was extremely attracted to him.
 Her response to him this afternoon had been passionate and unrestrained.
 And now he knew that when she'd said that she couldn't do it, she hadn't been talking about making love with him but about marrying Davis.
 And if he made love to her, she'd feel tied to him and be more likely to stay.
 If he slowly increased the heat of his kisses and caresses, made her so hot that she stopped thinking altogether, made her so wild with desire .
 .
 .
 Rick closed his eyes, flushed with both desire and chagrin.
 He'd just told Marie he wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

Would you like that?"
 "I'd love it!"
 She almost choked on her Slurpee, the first she'd ever had.
 "Where can I drive to?"
 "From one end of the parking lot to the other."
 "A parking lot?"
 "I'll take you to a big, empty parking lot somewhere and let you get the feel of it.
 When you feel comfortable, I might let you drive around some quiet neighborhoods, but you need to study the rules of the road so you can get a license.
 Then we'll see about trying out the streets downtown and the highways."
 "You have to have a license to drive?"

Then, she looked up and her expression reminded Rodregas of some girl who had gotten the perfect mid winter gift that she had been dreaming of.
 “These are not books on magic,” she said.
 “These are Grimoires, several of them of great power.” “Really?” Rodregas said, “I was a squire who learned a little magic, but I really can’t say that I know the difference between a book of magic and a Grimoire.” Imeralda looked surprised and said, “Oh, you guys must depend on the oral tradition.
 That is a hard way to learn.
 The symbols and geometric figures that form a powerful spell are often too complex to learn from just the spoken word.” Rodregas cut in and clarified, “I mean, in the order we did read books on magic theory and history, but I never felt energy from them before.” Imeralda nodded, “Let me explain.
 First, you have a lot more power now, and power calls to power.
 So, you are a lot more sensitive to the power that the books have.
 But what separates Grimoires from other books is that they are made like the stone walls of these buildings, by Nymphs.
 It is thought that the original reason was simply to have books that would not rot over a period of centuries, but the nymph-created paper and leather can hold a faint imprint of magic.
 “Each time that the sorcerers cast a spell from the book, it lightly engraved the pattern into the paige.

“Please, brother,” Qurrah said.
 “I need to know.”
 Harruq stared at the dirt, each breath making his shoulders heave.
 His mind reeled, and for reasons he did not understand, he opened his mouth and said, “That which I fear and desire.
 I have had no questions answered, but I do know this: the time for questions has long ended.”
 Velixar nodded.
 “Indeed, Harruq.
 It is time for action.
 I am done with both of you.
 Go home and rest.

I planned on playing that card for all it was worth.
 I was staying and that was it.
 Alec sighed, presumably in resignation, and then suddenly my legs were thrown up in front of me as he picked me up with inhuman speed.
 Only the steady pressure of Alec's arm around my waist kept me from screaming, and then I was back on my feet, and being carefully, but firmly shoved through a tangled knot of bodies.
 My shoes had never been intended to allow ankles to withstand that kind of punishment.
 Even just walking had been risky, so it wasn't a surprise when my right foot slipped, and a sharp knife of pain shot through that ankle as it collapsed under me.
 Dealing with blinding agony hadn't ever been my strong point.
 I opened my mouth to scream, only to find that no sound would come out.
 The world was still spinning, but I was oriented just enough to realize that Dominic had her hand over my mouth and nose.
 I pulled at her arm, but the effort was completely futile.

I was aghast, the whole country was aghast, I mean, those who cared.
 It seemed the vultures had descended and taken over.
 They were picking the bones of America, licking their slathering jaws and, well, it all was just so bleak bleak bleak.
 When they shot the kids at Kent, I went into a tailspin.
 I wish I had Neil’s presence of mind—I mean, he picks up his guitar and writes, “Tin soldiers and Nixon coming,” man, and just put it all out there, naked, true.
 It was like Lennon blasting us with “Revolution.”  And, man, I was just so out of it, I was just so fucking passive.
 I was inert, man.
 I couldn’t feel.
 You gotta understand, I wanted to be on the front lines, but I was so far away, I was in fucking Nether World, you know?
 Dylan asking, “How does it feel to be on your own like a complete unknown?” and I kept thinking about that and I was one gone gommie.

But she couldn't very well walk into her house wearing shorts and sneakers.
 She did, however, have on black lace underwear that she'd gotten at the mall.
 No one would know about that, and it would be a reminder of her adventure in 2011.
 She wandered full circle and, for the first time, wasn't disappointed when she saw Rick's fountain.
 He stood up when he saw her, and she walked into his arms.
 "What do I need to do to get ready for Hollywood?"
 she asked, rubbing her cheek against his shoulder.
 She spent the day washing and ironing and folding clothes and cleaning the house.
 While the lasagna she'd made for dinner baked, she made a list of what she wanted to buy the next day.
 They needed new beach towels and more sunscreen and aloe vera lotion.

"Do you want me to go get you a candy bar?"
 "No.
 I'm going to go take a shower while we wait."
 After her shower she rubbed on some rose-scented lotion.
 Her skin was hot from her day in the sun and just a little red.
 She'd put sunscreen on this morning so that she wouldn't get burned.
 Dropping the bottle onto the bed, she went back to Rick's room calling, "Is the pizza here yet?"
 "Not yet," he replied as he emerged from the bathroom, still toweling his hair dry.
 Marie stared.
 He was wearing only a pair of shorts.

Don’t let it touch me, please, please, DON’T LET IT TOUCH ME!”
 The man screamed for the next two minutes.
 Then he died.
 “What did you do to him?” Harruq asked once the man was dead.
 “Fear is an entertaining weapon, is it not?”
 The warrior shook his head in wonder, but Qurrah said no more.
 “Do we leave the bodies here?” Harruq asked.
 The necromancer trotted over to the dead noble and did not answer.
 Instead, he ruffled through the silk robes until he found a scroll marked with the seal of the king.
 Qurrah ripped it to shreds and let the pieces scatter in the wind, then he turned to his brother.

“I tried so hard.
 I have on all my 1927 clothes, and I didn’t think about anything but what’s going on at home.” “I’m sorry, sweetheart.”  He led her into the kitchen.
 “But maybe that’s not all there is to it.
 I looked at some of the chapters you’d marked.
 One of them says that the relative positions of the sun and moon and earth are important.” “Yes, I saw that.
 I tried to figure it out, and it seems like the best time would be in September.
 But I can’t wait until September!
 And what if that book isn’t right?” Rick hugged Marie, wiping away her tears.
 He led her inside and made her breakfast, which she barely touched.
 Nothing he said drew much of a response from her.

“Yup,” Harruq muttered.
 “I’m magical like that.”
 The elf glared at him.
 “Sorry,” he said, his face reddening.
 “I had a long night.”
 Aurelia nodded.
 She twirled the staff in the air and then hooked it underneath her arm.
 “Ready to start?”
 The half-orc shrugged.
 “Sure, why not?”

“No!” Harruq shouted.
 He pulled out one of his healing potions, yanked off the cork, and forced the contents down Aurelia’s throat.
 The elf gagged, retching up half of it onto her neck and chest.
 Harruq got out his last potion but could not open it for the shaking of his hands.
 Desperate, he put it down, picked up one of his swords, and shattered the top of the vial.
 He flung the potion back to Aurelia’s mouth, nearly shredding her lower lip on the broken glass.
 More of the silvery-blue liquid poured down her throat.
 Harruq sat there, clutching her hands in his and waiting.
 The seconds crawled slower than the longest of years.
 He didn’t care if anyone came and saw him, not even his brother.

The silence seemed to stretch into hours before Alec finally shook his head.
 "Good, because I don't want to leave.
 You said last night that your life felt meaningless before I came here, well, mine was even worse.
 The only thing that's kept me sane has been your behind-the-scenes help.
 I want to stay with you.
 I want to be with you."
 Alec studied me for a moment longer, and then nodded, a short, choppy motion with little if any of his usual grace.
 "Very well then.
 It's just after ten o'clock.
 Your mom is about to pull into the driveway.

The school is sponsoring a trip to Las Vegas to see the production of Les Misérables that just started.
 Tickets are available at a discounted rate in the office for the next two days."
 It was like someone had rifled through my mind to pick out my biggest disappointment in recent days, pulled it out and rubbed salt on the wound before cramming it back inside me.
 Of course I'd go see how big of a discount the school had gotten the tickets at, but it was extremely unlikely my tiny check would end up being enough.
 It took me a moment to realize Mr. Gossil hadn't ended his announcement.
 "...those wishing to be entered into the drawing should stop by the office between today and noon tomorrow."
 In the face of the near-universal apathy expressed by the rest of the student body, it took my mind several seconds to process exactly what had been said.
 I grabbed Brandon's arm and shook it to get his attention.
 "Did he just say they were drawing for free tickets?"
 Brandon looked slightly amused.

The tassels decorating their long robes identified them as members of council, but I wasn’t familiar with the two.
 They mustn’t have been from the village.
 As they approached Chevelle cautiously, I examined their insignia.
 Even if they weren’t from the village, I still needed council members to unbind me, and I had a sudden urge to go to them.
 But I remembered my warning to be still.
 “She’s not going back.” Chevelle’s tone, level and uncompromising, caught my attention.
 I pushed the hood back to better hear and the taller figure glared at me as he hissed, “You’re protecting her when you know what she’s capable of?” I flinched at his words, but something else had caught my eye.
 The robes were ornate, the tassels interwoven with color.
 He was Grand Council.
 I studied the other newcomer, who acted as if I wasn’t present.

Britney's innocuous words shouldn't have caused my mind to immediately sink back to the terror I'd felt this morning, but they did.
 For a moment I couldn't focus on what Britney was saying, my heartbeat had become completely erratic from the surge of adrenaline flooding my body as it futilely tried to escape the nameless things that'd been snapping at my heels.
 "...out in the south end of Zions.
 It was Mark Childs and Lessi Arnolds.
 The bodies were a couple of days old by the time search and rescue found them, but it was pretty obvious they'd been mauled by something."
 I opened my mouth to interrupt, but my vocal chords weren't working.
 Now that she'd finally broached the subject, Britney was unstoppable.
 "It had to have been a mountain lion, there isn't anything else around here that's both aggressive and big enough to kill people, but neither of them had been gnawed on at all, which was strange enough by itself.

 Britney looked around again to make sure nobody was in hearing range, and then leaned in even closer.

She turned to put her arms around him.
 "I love you, Father."
 "I love you too, darling.
 Where have you been?"
 Marie caught her breath.
 In her misery over leaving Rick, she hadn't gotten around to thinking up a plausible story.
 "I-I'd rather not talk about it."
 "Not talk about it?"
 Mrs. Tranton shot her husband a warning glance.
 Marie had surely been through a very traumatic experience, and they shouldn't make her talk about it until she was ready.

If the world now intends to uphold democracy and human rights as inalienable values, then the human right to live without the threat of a nuclear holocaust must be proclaimed and made inviolable.
 A durable non-proliferation regime can only be constructed on the basis of the universal abolition of nuclear weapons.
 Manufacture and possession of nuclear weapons must be banned.
 Use of such weapons must be outlawed as a crime against humanity.
 First use of such weapons by any power should automatically invoke the strongest collective security measures under the UN Security Council.
 The decision on whether to permit the continued existence of nuclear weapons is of too great importance to the future of humanity to be left to the discretion of one or a few member nations of the international community.
 Under the present structure of the UN, the only body with authority to act is the Security Council, but the veto power of the five permanent members deprives other nations of an effective voice.
 The proposal to ban completely the possession and use of nuclear weapons should be put before the Council.
 The right of veto should be rescinded with respect to this most crucial issue.
 A time-bound plan should be drawn up by the UN for complete and total nuclear disarmament by all nations.

The local armorer was also able to piece together some steel chain that was decent quality and a good leather harness for Doi’van and he was able to repair your armor.
 You now also have some chain that should fit over your leather armor.” Imeralda added, “I was able to recover only about a score of the arrows, but I have been working with some of the wood nymphs and the armorer and we now have a full set of arrows again.” Doi’van, at her motion towards his armor, picked up the pile of chain mail and tried it over his head.
 The opening on top actually fit over his huge head.
 Doi’van guessed that it had been the chain of the large overweight slaver that he had killed.
 While the equipment was all of average quality, Rodregas was smiling because clearly there were three sets of everything plus a pack horse for equipment.
 Imeralda was clearly planning on joining them.
 While that is what his heart hoped for he was not sure if it was the smartest move.
 When they were working on the tack for the horses, he went ahead and asked.
 “Imeralda, I want to make sure you want to continue with us.
 I mean I love to travel with you, but while Doi’van and I are warriors, when you joined us it was only as a travel companion.

I would tell him later when all was well .

 hopefully.
 If not, I needed to tell my wife to tell him how much I loved him, just in case.
 She broke down and I left the house before she had recomposed herself.
 I received my first instructions at the police station.
 Told to follow two undercover cars to the back of a nearby hotel, we were met by about a dozen different police officers in varying attire.
 Some were in marked squad cars but most looked like everything from an ordinary guy to a punk with a beanie on his head.
 Scruffy beards to cleanly shaven, they were an unlikely melting pot of law enforcement.

Adriana hasn't had the pleasure of listening to your songs."
 I'd rarely seen anyone change moods so quickly.
 "No.
 You know it isn't ready.
 I'll tell you when I've perfected it.
 Yes, you can bring Rachel, but I can't let anyone listen to it before it's ready."
 Alec bowed his head in acquiescence, grasping my hand as he turned to leave.
 His mother grabbed his arm before he could complete the motion.
 He halted instantly, despite there being no way she was strong enough to stop him.
 I doubted she had enough grip strength to slow even me down.

It is neither equitable nor justifiable.
 Already, 156 countries have signed the treaty, owing either to coercion or indifference, and the number is expected to increase to 170 out of 179 states by 1995.
 The acceptance of non-proliferation by these countries further delegitimizes the continued possession of nuclear weapons by any country.
 All of the treaty non-signatories can be persuaded to sign in exchange for annihilation of these weapons by those that now possess them.
 Under these circumstances, refusal to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty could be considered sufficient grounds for expulsion from UN membership.
 Without a universal ban, the efforts of the nuclear powers to stop proliferation lack moral authority.
 Arguments are often advanced that nuclear weapons cannot be ‘dis-invented’, and that the danger of a rogue state or terrorist group acquiring and threatening use of these weapons necessitates that the present nuclear powers retain them for such a contingency.
 With the massive conventional firepower already available, nuclear weapons are not needed for defence, even against a rogue state with nuclear capability, and they do not represent a credible defence against terrorism under any circumstances.
 How could nuclear weapons conceivably be used to retaliate against terrorism?
 Alternative solutions can be found to address these threats far more effectively.

These tapes somehow also disappeared until 1999, when they were found in a stockroom in an abandoned studio in Los Angeles by a technician there who, with some heaven-sent Extra Sensitive Perception, sent them to Camel Jeremy Eros, c/o City Lights Bookstore, where for a while I was taking my mail, while recovering from a broken relationship, one that emasculated me, silenced me, did me up a treat.
 These tapes were a godsend—they took me out of myself, out of the self-pity I was wallowing in.
 Many thanks to John Wender, editor extraordinaire, who recognized what we had here and ran them in his celebrated periodical.
 Hence, they ran first, almost in the form represented here, in three installments in Big City Magazine.

 Buddy Gardner died young, tragically, just weeks after these interviews were concluded.
 It lends a poignancy to what follows here, but is not the only reason to read, of course.
 There is Buddy’s stature as one of the truly original artists of his time.
 There is his infamous love affair with Lorelei who many blame for his death, like poor Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath.
 And there is the music, discussed here for the first time, how it was made, why it was made, for whom it was made.

I saw her as thin, pale skinned and strong like her mom, with reddish hair of a peculiar henna-like tint.
 Her eyes were bright and inquisitive, her mouth ever-ready to speak.
 "Oh Lord," I gasped because my heart was melting.
 A friend once asked me, "Do you think we can grow as much emotionally without having a child as we can with one?"
 All I could say was that my kids taught me how to love and, at twenty-six and twenty-three, they’re still teaching me.
 And with Zoë on her way, I found myself noticing people on sidewalks or in restaurants, imagining their lives and sending them good wishes, sometimes prayers.
 More often than before, I noticed hummingbirds, horizons, occotillos.
 Spring was the most glorious in years.
 I was feeling more all the time.
 In 1945, the year I was born, my grandma, Mary Durham Garfield, wrote this poem:

Imeralda smiled a soft smile, one that for a brief moment brought memories of the two of them back at the farm.
 “I,” she started and then paused as if caught up in her own words, “I think that is the ‘One Tree.’” At the responding look of confusion she said, “The legendary source of all Nymphs.
 While we serve the Gods like all mortals, the One Tree is our source.
 It is to us like water is for a fish.
 I don’t know how to even explain it to one who is not of our people.
 But I did not think it was real.
 It is a concept of what we are as a people.
 How can it be here off of a chamber for warriors earning the greater sigils?” Imeralda started forward.
 Rodregas caught her arm, holding her back.
 He was not sure what to say but Doi’van was.

 "Lauri says you're a paralegal," Rick said as they sat sipping tea and coffee before dinner.
 "Yeah--in Charlestown."
 "Is that where you live?"
 "No--I live in the North End.
 It's not a bad drive unless the traffic is really bad."
 The conversation was enjoyable, the dinner delicious, and Rick was glad he'd come.

 Ted whispered as Rick and Sharon were putting on their coats.

As a result, more and more effort was directed at eliminating or crippling the enemy’s economic and industrial capacity and the ‘national will’ to wage war.
 Targeting of civilian populations became increasingly common.
 In the two world wars in this century, opposing sides waged all-out war against the military, political, economic and social resources and capacities of the enemy society.
 The strategic bombings of the Second World War, the fire-bombing of Tokyo, and the nuclear devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki took this concept to the extreme.
 As a result, the ratio of military to civilian casualties in military conflicts changed dramatically.
 In the First World War, there were 20 military casualties for each civilian death.
 In the Second World War, the ratio was one to one.
 In the Korean War, civilian deaths out numbered military losses five to one.
 In the Vietnam War, this ratio rose to 20 to one.
 Advances in the sophistication and dissemination of modern military technology have fuelled this trend.

You're describing a crush, not love.
 He's tall, he's handsome, he makes you feel romantic--you don't love him!
 He's like a movie star."
 She withdrew her hand, her eyes flashing.
 "You don't know.
 He works with my father, he's already like a member of the family--" "Let him be a brother.
 Romance isn't everything, Marie, and if that's all you have, it doesn't even last very long.
 You need to enjoy everything together, going to-to speakeasies, going for walks, playing games, or just being together while you read.
 You've said he doesn't spend much time with you because he works so much.
 That's ridiculous.

4.Improve marketing: The organization of marketing is typically one of the weakest links and, therefore, one of the greatest barriers to economic growth and job growth.
 Brazil set up a distribution system for the export of citrus fruits that has enabled it to become the world's largest exporter of this commodity.
 Improve distribution and marketing systems, especially for agricultural produce, by identifying missing links and establishing successful model programmes that bridge the gap between rural producers and urban or overseas markets.
 5.Expand services: Actively encourage and support growth of the service sector through programmes similar to those utilized to support the expansion of small industry.
 6.Develop exports: The new GATT treaty ensures that, contrary to earlier projections, export-led growth is far from over.
 After agriculture, the textile and clothing industry is one of the largest employment sectors in developing countries.
 The industry's global exports are $250 billion a year, of which Asian countries command 40 per cent.
 Trade in clothing is expected to rise by 60 per cent and textiles by 34 per cent over the next ten years.
 As labour costs have risen in East Asia, greater opportunities are emerging for lower-wage developing countries to take a larger share in growing international markets.
 In order to take advantage of the increasing opportunities opened up by liberalization of world trade, developing countries should accelerate steps to expand export-oriented markets by forging foreign collaborations and overseas subsidiaries, acquiring technology, creating an attractive commercial environment for foreign investment, and continuously building the skills of the labour force.

International development force
 The goals of peace, prosperity and fulfilment for every human being represent formidable challenges – intellectual, attitudinal, organizational and technological.
 We cannot hope to reach such lofty achievements if we waste and squander the precious and abundant resources – mental, psychological, social and material – placed at our disposal.
 A massive reduction in emphasis on weapons production and military establishments, made possible by recent political events and demanded by the pressing unmet needs of people everywhere, represents both a great opportunity and a considerable challenge.
 The opportunity is not only further to reduce the threat of war by reducing the capacity for waging war, but also to redirect and utilize for other purposes the resources now dedicated to war making and prevention.
 The challenge is to do so at a time when rising unemployment and economic stagnation in many countries make further cuts in the size of the military unpopular domestically.
 Since 1990, the total number of military personnel worldwide has declined by two million or about six per cent.
 By 1998, a further decrease of at least two million is anticipated.
 A large proportion of these demobilized people have already joined, or will soon join, the forces of the unemployed.
 Some may be tempted to market their military skills elsewhere.

I turned around and two hands were on my neck choking me and shoving me against the door.
 Dino, in the darkness, had a grip on my neck that he would not release.
 I grabbed his wrist and tried to push his hands off to no avail.
 I couldn’t breathe, so I couldn’t talk.
 It was oddly silent except for a pinging sound, as if someone was dropping pennies in a pan.
 It was the sound of the puka shells from the necklace I was wearing landing on the tile floor beneath me.
 Ping, ping, puh dit dit, ping.
 More of the shells fell and bounced along the tile.
 I could not get a next breath.
 I tried to pry his fingers from my neck but I couldn’t get my fingers between his to loosen his grip.

But without the honest search for connection with the Holy Spirit, none of that good advice carries much weight.”
 Eric vs. Max Von Sydow
 Back on the road my thoughts pick up where they left off in San Luis Obispo, and I wonder if Brother Lawrence perceived his constant companion as the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit.
 Maybe my problem with adoring God is my habit of looking at, or for, God the Father, who in my vocabulary is easy to respect, admire, stand in awe of, or even worship, but is hard for me to adore.
 God, to me, looks more like a vapor.
 And his whispering voice either sounds too much like my own to be surely authentic, or else it’s so soft, I’m not often sure I heard right.
 The Jesus I used to picture looked like a young Max Von Sydow in The Greatest Story Ever Told, and his expressions appeared more posed or acted than honestly human.
 But now he's beginning to look more like Eric.
 Eric possessed by Jesus, I can adore.
 I still see him.

Larger private investment flows invigorated economic growth and made capital more accessible to larger numbers of people than ever before in human history.
 The European Union expanded to embrace newly democratic countries and blazed a path right through the former heartland of nationalism for the integration of the united peoples of Europe.
 Most important of all, the erstwhile very real and imminent threat of global confrontation and nuclear destruction radically diminished, spurred by negotiations between Russia and USA that have led to a 75 per cent reduction in the number of nuclear warheads stockpiled by both sides.
 ICPF’s report projected a vision of Uncommon Opportunities for rapid and radical advances in global peace and development.
 Its central thrust is the inextricable linkage between peace, employment, food security and human development.
 As peace is a sine quo non for development, creation of employment opportunities for all is essential for maintenance of peace and social stability, food security and eradication of all forms of poverty.
 The experience of the past decade strongly supports the view that a more peaceful global environment is more conducive for development.
 Military spending declined by a third in the years immediately following the end of the Cold War, partly due to real cuts in defence spending and partly due to the collapse of the Russian rouble and changes in the value attributed to Soviet arms spending.
 These real gains did not translate into a significant increase in foreign aid, which was what many hoped and expected.
 But that does not mean there has been no peace dividend.

Most of the teachers and ROTC tailed behind.
 Others returned to the basketball game, leaving Billy, Eric and me unguarded.
 We slipped away, into the shadows beside a row of classrooms.
 As we stood there assessing our options, Eric said, “Get Billy out of here.” He pointed to a parking lot.
 “Go down there and hide till you can hitch a ride.” “So, you’re going to find Kenny?” I asked.
 “Or what?” Staring at his feet, kicking the dirt, Eric said, “I’m going to stay and take my punishment.” “For what?
 Kenny smashed the window.” Billy said, “You stay here, they won’t catch Kenny and they’ll blame the whole thing on you, because you’re the only one they’ve got.
 They’ll kick you out of school for good.
 They know we’ve been drinking.” Eric had picked up some dirt.
 He was pouring it from one hand to the other.

 In his pride, Vaelor will demand them to leave.
 A messenger is already en route.
 I have haunted his dreams as well.

They slithered from the shadows of the trees and bushes.
 There hundreds of them, each easily my height.
 They were covered in black, grey green scales that were each the size of my hand.
 They were layered on its body like plated armor.
 Their beady dark, red eyes sent shivers down my spine.
 I slung my bow back over my shoulder and grabbed my hunter's knife from its sheath on my side.
 One stopped and raised its head up towards me.
 It opened its mouth to reveal rows of sharp, yellow fangs.
 A chuckle escaped its mouth.
 “What are you going to do with that, half-ling?” it said with a voice that sent needles into my skin.

 “Move along, move along,” Rodregas said.
 He prodded the prisoner up the roughly hewn stone steps none too gently with the butt end of the lit torch in his hand.
 "We don’t have all night."
 The rough handling of the prisoner seemed like a brash act for a man of sixty years, since the young man could have broken him in half with ease if he chose to do so.
 He was powerfully built, and towered head and shoulders over Rodregas.

 this was nothing like Davis's kisses.
 Rick's kiss was making her tremble.
 She returned it briefly and then pulled away, hiding her face against his shoulder in confusion.
 How could she like Rick's kiss more than Davis'?
 How could his kiss make her feel so hot and weak?
 Rick drew in a shaky breath, laying his cheek against her hair.
 That one small, hesitant kiss had been so exciting that he knew he'd be lost if she ever kissed him the way he wanted.

When it opened its mouth, no sound came forth, just a soft puff of ash.
 “A soul seeking release,” Qurrah said.
 “How destructive, I wonder?”
 “Get rid of it,” Harruq said as he picked up the other sword the orc had dropped.
 “You disagree?” Qurrah asked, his delight vanishing into a sudden frown.
 “No,” Harruq said.
 He thought to explain and then just shrugged.
 “It makes me uneasy,” he said instead.
 “But do as you wish.”
 The frailer brother approached the end of the alley where the sound of combat was strongest.

"Please, Mom.
 Where else would I be?
 Saturdays are one of my only two chances all week to actually sleep in.
 It isn't like I'm going to climb out of bed at the crack of dawn and go hiking or something."
 Mom's chuckle was almost genuine.
 If Alec hadn't implied she was going to suspect I'd been up to no good, I probably wouldn't have even noticed how off she sounded.
 "You're right, dear.
 I shouldn't have doubted you.
 I just had a few kids come hiking past this morning talking about this massive party the entire school was at last night.
 I know it's completely irrational, but I kept thinking about you there with all that alcohol."

As Chevelle moved past Anvil and Grey, they turned to follow him.
 The silver-haired elves and their dogs were nowhere in sight.
 My gaze caught Steed, who was watching me.
 I always forgot how strikingly handsome he was until I looked right at him.
 He wore a thin, loose shirt now, rolled at the sleeves and covered by a leather vest.
 It matched the long cuffs on his forearms, the same dark, worn leather of his saddles.
 He stepped closer, taking my chin in his hand to examine my face in the moonlight.
 He purred something toward Ruby about her decorations and gave me a wink as he walked off in the direction Chevelle had gone.
 We were alone then, Ruby and I, and I was sure this was going to hurt more than my other training.
 She untied her cloak and tossed it to land with a muffled sound on the rocks.

 “Aurry, are you there?” he shouted.
 He had hoped the elf would be waiting for him, but as he neared their usual clearing there was no sign of her.
 His heart skipped, and he feared she had already gone off to prepare for battle.
 “Aurelia, come on out now,” he shouted again.

“And I love the feel of all the magic.
 My body was meant to live in a place that has more magic than our world does, but the lines are chaotic.
 It is hard to sleep on a wild line.
 It is going to be hard to stay here for long.” Doi’van’s deep voice had the tone of making a simple observation, not conversation.
 Rodregas nodded; he had been waiting for the comment, but he had thought it would be Imeralda who brought it up.
 “True,” he said, “unless you have a way of smoothing it out.” Rodregas waited for a few seconds as the three approached the main farmhouse building.
 The walls were of thick cut stone and it was built on an impressive scale for a farmhouse, though worn-looking.
 Of course, there were no signs of a roof, doors or windows.
 As they entered the yard, the feeling of the hair standing up on their bodies settled down and instead a feeling of fullness replaced it.
 The horses had been acting up and Rodregas hoped that with the energy smoothing out, the horses would stop fighting their lines.

He made his lips eager but light, not too forceful.
 He was strong and he let her feel his strength, but he also gave her plenty of leverage so that if she truly wanted to pull away she could.
 He was making his desire clear, but the decision was hers.
 He cared for her too much, and was so determined to walk the path of righteousness and he was determined to be very careful.
 A younger man would have been in a hurry.
 But Rodregas was lost in the softness of her lips, the look of her eyes, and the beauty of her spirit.
 He wished he could make this moment last forever.
 Rodregas believed that most women did not know if they were interested until a man makes his move.
 It is something instinctive; there is a single moment when either it clicks or it does not.
 The moment held unmoving, the dice were rolling; and she responded to his kiss, but did not sink into his arms.

Margaret had been my friend longer than anyone except my cousins.
 Since second grade.
 All through elementary school, she was always the smartest in class, and kinder than anybody else I knew.
 She spent eighth grade in my mom's English and Social Studies class.
 Later my mom called her the brightest student she ever taught.
 And her pure and soulful singing would land her, only months after high school, on a weekly television show with a folk group, The Good Time Singers.
 That summer before our senior year, Margaret's best friend was Pam Greenman, who attended our rival high school.
 Lane was someone I probably never would've befriended if not for Eric.
 Since we met in seventh grade, I had considered Lane a smart-mouthed little pest while he thought of me as a big, dumb oaf.
 In Eric's company, we each learned better.

There were long hills ahead, the grass a light gray.
 “This place looks like it’s from a book about hell,” Seth said.
 “Where are we now?” I asked.
 He shook his head.
 “Do we ever know where we are?” I shook my head and he sighed.
 “Exactly, we never do.
 You really got to stop asking that question.” He started to hike the hill.
 “We‘re trying to find out.” I walked up behind him, my leg muscles cramping.
 When we got to the top, I fell on my knees and breathed heavily.
 Seth looked over his shoulder, his eyes twinkling in amusement.

Rick asked that evening as he watched her pack.
 "Yes.
 This has been a dream-come-true, and I'd like to stay in the dream."
 With a sigh she folded her baja and put it in her suitcase.
 He stood, placing his hands on her shoulders from behind.
 "If we get a chance, we'll come back."
 She turned around, gazing up at him anxiously.
 "I didn't mean to sound ungrateful.
 I've had a wonderful time, and--" "Shhh--it's OK."  He reached out to caress her hair.
 "I'm glad you've had such a good time here that you don't want to leave."

Before either of us could do anything, some light appeared out of nowhere.
 When it died down, we found you lying on the ground unconscious.
 That’s basically it.” “We don’t know what the light was.” Emily added.
 “But whatever it was, it saved your life.” “Uh I have a feeling I should thank it, but I don’t know how you thank light.” I muttered.
 “You thank it like you would thank anyone else,” A voice said.
 I almost jumped to the moon in surprise.
 Out of nowhere someone, or something, appeared beside Jason.
 I think Jason was more scared because he actually jumped into the air.
 As it came into view, it became obvious that it was a girl.
 She in a yellow cloak and had dazzling red hair.

They were definitely closer now.
 They'd stopped howling, but I could still hear them.
 I somehow found myself on my back again, looking up at the biggest wolf I'd ever seen.
 TV had given me the impression that a wolf shouldn't be much bigger than a German Shepherd.
 These guys were roughly the size of a small pony, one nearly black, the other more of a gray color, both with yellowish eyes, and lips pulled back to show teeth the size of my fingers.
 Most of my jeans had been torn away from my right calf, which was bleeding fairly profusely, but I didn't feel any pain.
 It was like my mind had finally torn loose from the moorings that usually held it in contact with reality.
 I was going to die, ripped to shreds by the same impossible animals that had killed the hikers a few months ago, but I just couldn't bring myself to care.
 Nobody would even miss me.
 The black wolf was inching towards me now, growling low in its throat.

She had to go home.
 To have Rick, she would have to give up her parents, her friends, her home.
 She loved Rick with her whole heart, but how could she .
 .
 .
 how could she give up everything she'd ever known?
 Rick handed Marie his handkerchief.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart.
 I'm sorry that you feel torn.
 But I have to tell you that I'd give anything in this world to have you stay here with me.

Recommendations to Achieve Full Employment in Industrial Nations
 Earlier we noted long-term trends that suggest the recent rise in unemployment in the West does not necessarily forebode, and need not necessarily result in, chronically higher rates of unemployment in these countries.
 Granted that the necessary political and social commitment is forthcoming, there are a range of strategies which, taken in the proper measure and combination, can dramatically accelerate job growth and reduce unemployment.
 Each of these strategies has proved effective in stimulating employment, though none by itself may be sufficient to solve the problem.
 A comprehensive, total approach, rather than partial and half-way measures, is needed.
 No industrial country can claim that it systematically exploits all the potential benefits of the strategies in this list.
 This should be the highest priority of every Western government today.
 1.Promote small businesses: All the publicity given to the impact of down-sizing by major corporations has obscured the fact that the top 500 US firms employ less than five per cent of the US workforce.
 It is also the smaller firms that are responsible for job growth.
 Businesses employing fewer than 20 workers presently account for 57 per cent of new job creation in Europe.

I listened, hoping to gain clarity… but something was still wrong.
 Nothing fit.
 They discussed Junnie and Anvil and Fannie, but those all felt like two sets of people now.
 They were worried; I could hear the stress in their tones.
 How long had I been like this?
 It seemed so long, trapped here.
 I remembered the vines.
 I tried to feel my arms, see if they were still there.
 Was that why I couldn’t move?
 Was I still tied to a wall?

They were small but were growing fast as we neared them.
 I could feel the dragon’s muscles pump underneath my legs.
 Small gusts of air rolled off the dragon’s wings that blew Emily’s hair in her face.
 I smiled as she raked the pink strands out of her mouth.
 We dipped down and I felt the “stomach-in-your-chest” feeling you usually get from rollercoasters.
 I closed my eyes and tried to ignore it but I couldn’t.
 I hated this feeling just as much as I hated puking, and the chills that liked to run up my spine at random times.
 Then all of a sudden, the dragon stopped.
 My eyes opened in horror as I saw the small trickle of blood fall from a hole in the right wing.
 Then we started to fall.

“Most men cowered at the sight of it.
 Do not be ashamed,” Velixar said.
 “There might have been a victor, but Celestia interfered at last.
 She cast each god far beyond the sky, to where she herself had made a home.
 She gave half to Ashhur and half to Karak.
 The souls of the soldiers who fought and died alongside them were given to their masters.
 She cursed the elves who sided with Karak, branding them the ‘orcs,’ or ‘betrayers’ in her tongue.
 Once the brother gods were locked away from the world, and each other, Celestia issued her final decree.”
 “What was it?” asked Qurrah after Velixar remained quiet for a moment.
 “She ordered that Ashhur and Karak continue the fight they refused to end for all eternity.

Good luck, I'll see you later.
 --A.
 My backpack creaked and groaned as I picked it up.
 Luckily most of my classes weren't moving as fast as I'd expected.
 I was far enough ahead I could start picking a few subjects and working on them every night instead of bringing home my entire locker every day.
 As always, it was already heating up despite the sun having only barely cleared the mountains.
 It did seem like it wasn't quite as hot though.
 Maybe it was getting late enough in the year to bring the temperatures down slightly.
 It was too much to hope it would actually drop to the low seventies, even when December came around.
 I made it down the lane and then started worrying.

Jim – Hard to say, this has got to be more harmless than some of the other things he was doing though.
 Most likely he’ll just get chased off by some angry tourists.
 Liz – What’s he done that is worse than this?
 And what did he mean when he said ‘you’re good at this sort of thing.’
 Jim – He didn’t mean anything by it.
 Liz – He meant something by it, otherwise he wouldn’t have said anything.
 Now what did you do?
 Jim – you know Gene, he says thing all the time.
 He was just being Gene.
 Liz – What did you do?

I placed my last dish down and sat in my chair.
 Dad chuckled.
 “You’re so clumsy.
 I wouldn’t be surprised if you tripped on your own feet.” “Yup, that’s me, clumsy.” I pulled my leg close to my body.
 My parents had believed for a long time that I was a klutz.
 That was the only way to explain the million of cuts and bruises I gained from fighting creatures.
 The truth is that I have really great balance, which I had gained from so much fighting.
 I was a little klutzy when I was small, so it was easy for my parents to believe I still was.
 Mom placed the food on the table.
 “Dinner!”

Mom didn't seem to think it was at all odd that the city had flip-flopped so completely on the job.
 First she had it, then she didn't, now she did again.
 None of it made sense, but she seemed perfectly ready to accept everything at face value.
 Maybe her way was the best.
 I certainly envied her.
 Not the not knowing, but the fact that she didn't have to worry about what it all meant.
 How did I get stuck being the parent, while she got to be the kid?
 Who'd be interested in helping us?
 No, that wasn't the right question.
 The key to figuring this all out was to decide who could've helped us out.

"Rick!"
 She could hear him hurrying toward her, and she turned to meet him.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, hugging her close.
 Tears rolled down her cheeks, and she choked back a sob.
 She missed her mother.
 She loved television and the microwave and blue jeans, but she wanted to exclaim over them with her mother.
 And she wanted to cuddle up next to Davis as they watched television together.
 Her father would buy them one.
 Well, if there were televisions in 1927, he would.
 Maybe she should see if she could carry one back.

She slid her arm around John and smiled at her parents.
 "There's nothing that could make me happier than being with my whole family."
 "We need to call Davis," Mrs. Tranton said.
 Marie's face fell.
 "That can wait.
 I'd rather it be just the four of us for a while."
 "Soon it'll be the six of us."
 She frowned up at her brother.
 "What do you mean?"
 "We might just have to make it a double wedding."

“Can you tell me your name?” “Elfreda,” I answered immediately.
 He waited for the rest.
 But I had two answers, didn’t I?
 I chose.
 “Of North Camber.” It must have been the right answer, because he grabbed me, exultant, sighing and kissing my skin.
 He held me with a fierceness, a gentleness, that took my breath.
 His lips trailed my cheeks, murmuring words and careful of wounds as they swept to a temple, my eyelid, the corner of my mouth.
 He lingered there, unable to resist touching the broken skin of my lips, even if it were only feather light, the barest brush of skin.
 He drew away slowly, feeling my shock, or seeing it in my eyes, and realizing his mistake.
 His expression fell, but he didn’t take his hands away.

“I don’t know.
 Bored.”
 “Am I not a challenge?”
 He made vague shrug that could be taken either way.
 Let her think that was it, he thought.
 It was a whole lot better than the truth.
 Aurelia, however, seemed none too pleased.
 She twirled her staff again.
 “You might be surprised, orcyboy, but I could beat you in a spar.”
 Harruq scoffed.

He sighed.
 “You’re right.
 I do know.”
 Silence followed.
 The two continued staring, each wishing to speak their mind but unable to summon the courage.
 “You are a wise man,” Dieredon said, breaking the moment.
 “You know who is in the right in this conflict, as do I.”
 “Yes, we both do,” Antonil agreed.
 He glanced to the elf, his face asking the question he could not voice.
 “No, I will not fight at their side,” Dieredon answered.

“Our lineage is long and we breed the best stallions in the land.” Chevelle spoke up.
 “Yes, I have heard much regarding the lines of Free Runner and Grand Spirit.
 Tell me, is that what brings you out this far?” They carried on the exchange and Chevelle explained we’d be needing horses.
 I sat back down, defeated.
 This was it.
 He was here to drag me back to the village.
 For my sentence by council.
 I listened as plans were made for a trade, Steed agreeing to bring in the herd so Chevelle would be able to choose in the morning.
 They kept talking, settling into conversation.
 Steed offered Chevelle what was left of the roast and they sat, Chevelle beside me and Steed across from us.

She always shows up after I do.”
 The smaller half-orc scanned the area, seeing no sign of the elf.
 “Perhaps she is not coming,” Qurrah offered.
 “You are late, after all.
 On the other hand, perhaps I scared her off.
 I do have a creepy aura about me, wouldn’t you agree?”
 “Suuuure, Qurrah,” Harruq said, crossing his arms as he waited.
 “You’re big and scary and send little kiddies running when they see you on the street.”
 “I wouldn’t be surprised,” said a female voice behind the two brothers.
 “Any man who would hang out with a brute like Harruq must be a disturbed individual.”

Then he turned to Emily and Jason and said, “Ah, it’s great to meet the other two.” He beamed at all four of us.
 “Hi,” Emily said, looking a little freaked out.
 “So now that you’re here, are we going to get a move on or what?” “Oh of course, follow me please.” He shuffled off and disappeared behind the statue.
 Jason raised an eyebrow.
 “Where is he going?” Emily sighed.
 “There’s only one way to find out.” She walked behind the statue.
 Seth, Jason, and I followed her.
 As soon as I was on the other side, I gasped at what I saw.
 In front of me was an archway.
 Two entwined hooks were mounted on the top.

And Qurrah, remember to bring his blade with you.”
 The two brothers bowed and then left to do as their master commanded.
 !
 [section break](break.png)
 Dieredon watched the brothers travel back to Woodhaven.
 He had been waiting outside the town, and in the starlight the swathe of darkness rolling across the land had caught his eye.
 He had followed and from a distance observed the short meeting.
 His eyes flipped between the half-orcs and their master.
 His heart was torn.
 He had already warned Harruq that he would tolerate no strange behavior, yet he had given a similar warning to the man with the ever-changing face.

Then we'd open gifts and then have hot chocolate and cinnamon rolls and watch home movies.
 Teri and I would always spend the night there, and we'd all go to my grandparents' house on Christmas morning and have lunch with all the aunts and uncles and cousins."
 "What happened last year?"
 "My parents sold their house and moved to Florida.
 They came here, and Teri did too, but it wasn't the same.
 We--"  His eyes flew to hers.
 She met his gaze.
 "And what if you hadn't even been able to be with them at all?"
 He swallowed.
 "I would have been very upset."

Had that been only nine days ago?
 It seemed like a long time.
 Rick was in the hall waiting for her.
 She blushed when she looked into his eyes.
 She'd spent the previous evening cuddled up to him, returning the gentle kisses he'd kept raining on her lips.
 Rick had kissed her more times last night than Davis had the entire time they'd been together, and she couldn't look at him without thinking of those kisses.
 Silently Rick took her hand and led her downstairs.
 In the garden, he took her face between his hands, kissing her softly.
 "If you get home, I'll miss you."
 "I'll miss you too," she whispered, hugging him.

But I could just imagine the way perfect little Evelyn would repeat the story in town.
 Poor Elfreda, sitting alone in the weeds, couldn’t even make grass grow.
 What can we do to help her?
 We should have a Council meeting on it, I’m sure.
 Poor, poor thing.
 I stayed where I sat, forcing my eyes to the ground.
 But then I pictured the smirk on her face as she mocked me to the villagers, to Council, and couldn’t stop the resentment from boiling up.
 My ears rang with it.
 “Choo!” I glanced up at Evelyn through the jagged line of my bangs.
 “A… a… choo!” she wheezed.

Ruby had been right to drug me; I didn’t think I could have handled it otherwise.
 They were watching me, unsure what I was doing as I sat helpless and swearing.
 “I need something to draw with.” Ruby pulled a piece of charcoal and scrap of paper from her bags.
 I rushed to sketch the path I remembered from my dream, focusing on the ring of trees with the most detail.
 “They are there.” The men stood, motionless and staring until Anvil crossed the room to retrieve the map.
 He bowed a little as he took the paper from my hands and then hurried out, Grey following.
 Chevelle stayed.
 Ruby turned to him and breathed a deep sigh but he didn’t respond.
 My head throbbed and I groaned as I pressed the bridge of my nose.
 He was beside me in a flash, unspeaking.

We spent the rest of lunch pacing around the outside of the school while he worked through whatever was bothering him.
 When the warning bell finally rang, he turned and looked at me with a considering smile.
 We stood like that for a good thirty seconds before he reached a single finger up and traced the left side of my face as he leaned in slightly.
 It was simultaneously the scariest and most exciting thing I'd ever experienced.
 Even as I leaned in a little bit myself, my thundering heart seemed to be trying to leap out of my throat solely for the purpose of disrupting what looked very much like it was going to be my first kiss.
 Every tiny hair on my body stood up in a shiver of nervousness as he tilted his head to the side, and then he broke off, shaking himself slightly as he gave me a smile.
 For a second I thought he was rejecting me, that he'd decided not to kiss me because he wasn't interested.
 Only the way he reached out for my hand indicated that he really wasn't repulsed by me.
 It bothered me the entire time I was in History, and then just before I got to Physics it hit me.
 He hadn't stopped because he didn't want to kiss me.

“Don’t worry, it’s only water,” someone reassured me.
 At the word, I realized I was parched, bone dry.
 I forced myself up, keeping my eyes tight as I concentrated on getting the glass to my lips.
 They were rough, cracked; I could feel them against the rim of the glass.
 I wondered if it was dried blood or if I had been down so long they’d simply split.
 I drank the full glass and felt it exchanged for another.
 I finished it as well and started to lean back.
 There was a pillow behind me now, keeping me in a sitting position.
 It was soft.
 Everything surrounding me felt warm and smooth.

But you…”
 Again that greedy look.
 “You are extraordinary.
 I do not have to give you unearned power.
 I must simply guide and instruct.” Velixar stood, and when his power flared, Qurrah fell to his knees and worshipped his new master.
 “You are what I have searched for all these years.
 You and I will destroy this world side by side.
 We will lay waste to all life and put absolute order upon every last soul.”
 “Teach me,” Qurrah said, his mouth buried into the dirt.
 “Show me the power I have sought for so very long.”

If we were to leave, I wanted to leave on our own terms, not like that.”
 He swore a few times, getting progressively more colorful as he went.
 “Two minutes alone with that guard,” he muttered.
 “I’d have him drinking through a brand new hole in his neck.”
 “How skilled are you with those?” Qurrah asked, gesturing at the swords in the grass next to Harruq.
 Even though they lived in such cramped quarters, Qurrah still knew very little of Harruq’s life other than what he did at his request.
 “I’ve watched the guards training new men,” Harruq said, drawing a blade and holding it with one hand.
 “And I’ve been practicing every night after you’re in bed and no one is around to watch and get curious.
 Near the castle they have these stumps for smacking with your sword.
 Not sure what for, but it helps them, and it seemed to help me.

How is that possible?"
 Rachel's expression as she tried to understand my question was so surprised it actually managed to lighten the mood.
 "Oh, I forget sometimes how much you don't know.
 I'm normal, and Mom's normal, but everyone else is a shape shifter.
 Human-shape shifter marriages almost never happen, but when they do the kids can go either way.
 Alec became a shape shifter, and I'm just a run-of-the-mill girl without even a single superpower."
 We sat in silence for several seconds as I tried to process how that new piece of information fit in with everything else I already knew.
 The obvious, if somewhat selfish, implication was that maybe it really was possible for someone like Alec to want to be with someone like me.
 There were plenty of other things to think about though.
 "Wow, is that hard?

I am shown new surveillance photos of the two suspects and their vehicle: a red Dodge Charger with tinted windows.
 The code word which I am to use in a sentence to confirm the exchange of money for drugs has been changed to “Reno” and I see a pattern so I assume that if the deal does not go down this time, my next code word may be “Vegas.” I pray there isn’t a next time.
 Chapter 20: Going Down Finally a red Dodge Charger is driving slowly over the entrance bridge.
 I say, “Red Dodge Charger approaching at one o’clock,” attempting not to move my lips, as the vehicle is coming almost directly towards me on my right.
 The Dodge slows almost to a stop just a couple of car lengths away.
 I am unable to see in the tinted windows of the car but I am certain they can see me; I stare back as if to say, “Is that you?” They are obviously aware that I am there, alone and awaiting their arrival.
 The car slowly pulls away after taking a good look at me.
 I lose sight of them, as they seem to be going towards the opposite end of the parking lot.
 I assume they will pull around after checking out the surroundings but instead my crack-berry rings within seconds.
 It is Ashley and she is trying to move me to a Starbucks that is on the other side of the same parking lot.

“It’s better to spar with another, remember?”
 Aurelia frowned.
 “You know I am a sorceress.
 My time should be spent studying my craft.
 I only wanted to be proficient with my staff, not a master.”
 A tiny bit of panic crept into Harruq’s voice.
 “Yeah, but, but, it’s only an hour or two, and who said you were proficient anyway?
 I could beat you without trying, and so could anyone better than me.
 It would be stupid now to just stop and…”
 Aurelia crossed the distance between them and placed her hand across his mouth to shut him up.

 "I-I need a place to stay until I get back."
 He smiled.
 "I think I can stand having you around for a while."
 "I don't want to be a burden .

 "You won't be.
 I think it'll be fun."
 She smiled then.

Undaunted, the elf stepped closer, ducked underneath the guard captain’s return swing, and then kicked at the arrow still lodged in his shin, finally making Antonil drop his blade.
 The elf stood, drawing an arrow as he did.
 Antonil, now lying on the ground, struggled to bring his shield over his chest.
 Part of it caught beneath his side and would not come.
 He would not be able to block in time.
 A loud wooden crash stole away the elf’s focus.
 The door to the home behind him exploded into splinters as a huge projectile shot through it.
 The elf spun, his eyes widening as he saw what had shattered the door: a massacred elven body.
 He readied his bow and released an arrow at the next sign of movement.
 Unfortunately, it was another elven body, curiously missing its left arm and leg.

Moving was torment.
 All his extremities grew cold and his head felt light.
 The pain in his shoulder threatened to send him into shock.
 It was just waiting for his body to succumb.
 His eyes searched for anything that could grant him cover.
 The forest was too far, and all about was shin-high grass.
 “No choice,” he gasped.
 His entire right half of his body ached.
 “Celestia, grant me mercy.
 I cannot go further.”

I assumed Steed had control of my horse; I was simply concentrating on staying in the saddle as we ran beside him.
 The horses edged closer to the creek, splashing along the muddy bank and then the shallows of the water.
 Silt and cold water sprayed my face as we ran.
 I wondered if this was what it felt like to fly like the fairies.
 We followed the creek until it turned west and we kept north, slowing to a walk.
 I tried to catch my breath.
 Steed was watching me, smiling appreciatively, and I realized I was wearing a huge grin.
 And about three pounds of mud.
 The slower pace gave me time to take everything in.
 The ground had leveled off again, clearing to open meadows of low grass and a few scattered trees.

"So what do you think happened?"
 "Britney, what are you doing?"
 "What?
 You finished up your homework already and she left.
 We can totally talk right now.
 What do you think happened?
 I'll bet she just got some really, really bad news."
 I felt a dull ache starting behind my eyes.
 "Just because I finished my Physics doesn't mean I don't have other stuff I need to do, and I don't even want to guess at what would make her go that white.
 I just hope whatever it was turns out not to be as bad as she thought it was."

I even let her lead me up the creaky stairs to show me the 'amazing view' for the third time.
 Mom pulled the mirrors out of my hands as soon as I reached the larger bedroom, and nudged me towards the window.
 "Admit it, Adri, we didn't get sunsets like this very often in Minnesota."
 "Adriana," I corrected automatically, trying to avoid thinking about where my nickname had come from.
 The sunset was beautiful, just starting to turn the sky pink as a prelude to the glorious oranges that would no doubt follow.
 It was the kind of thing that Mom was always trying to capture with her camera, but which never seemed to turn out quite as good as the real thing.
 The sunset wasn't what captured my interest though, it was the greenery.
 Mom's room looked out to the west, the gorgeous side that reminded me of the place and people that would always be home.
 Mom carting me off to the middle of nowhere wasn't going to change that.
 There was a huge tree on the far edge of the yard.

"Mmm."
 She kissed him again.
 Rick returned her kiss and then gently disengaged her arms.
 "It's getting late.
 We need to get home."
 He helped her into the car.
 "I think I like 1927 cars better than 2011 cars," Marie said as Rick slid behind the wheel.
 "Why?"
 "I could sit right beside you in a 1927 car."
 "You have a good point."

They asked you to stop and you did?
 Why didn’t I think of that?
 Eugene – There were eight large hairy men, and they had knives and clubs.
 I assume you’ve seen movies about bikers.
 Can we get on with the new name now?
 Jim – Ah yes, biker movies, I don’t think you’d have made one of them a good wife anyways.
 Guess asking you to stop wouldn’t work for me after all.
 Liz – I told you that you should start lifting weights, besides you might look cute in a leather jacket.
 Jim – I think it’s easier not to piss large men off, then they have no reason to hurt me, and I have no reason to life weights, so I don’t need large muscles.
 Unless you count the appeal to chicks.

I panicked when I realized just how badly I wanted to slip back into that twilight world where nothing hurt, where it didn't matter if people liked me or not.
 The one where I still had all three of the most important people in my world.
 The fear that I'd give in, that I'd end up in a hospital during the day or two it took Mom to realize I hadn't made it home from school, pulled me back sooner than normal.
 For a second my mind inhabited a body that wouldn't obey any of the normal commands.
 Fear snaked out from my center when my eyes wouldn't open, but before my heart could really start accelerating, my eyelids started functioning again.
 The desks on the route between Alec and I were lying haphazardly on their sides, but there wasn't any sign of Alec.
 Mrs. Alexander was looking down at me, concern etched into her features, and the beginnings of a crowd was starting to form as the rest of the students came over to look at the freak.
 Only something wasn't right.
 They weren't towering enough.
 When you pass out on a regular basis, you get used to finding yourself on the floor surrounded by concerned-looking people, but none of these people were looming properly.

Karen – How about we just shorten it to pervert?
 Art – Noooo, that doesn’t feel right to me either.
 Karen – Then what would you prefer Mister?
 Art – Well, it’s a bit of a mouthful, but a bit more accurate than ‘dirty old perverted man’ or whatever.
 I mean ‘dirty old pervert man’ sounds a lot like a super villian’s name or something, and I don’t really think that I could be considered a super villain by any stretch of the concept.
 On top of that there is the ‘old’ part, I’m not really that old, I’m only forty-two years old, which may seem ancient beyond belief to a beautiful young woman such as yourself, but when you get to my level, well, it just kind of is how old you are.
 It doesn’t feel much different than when I was in my twenties or thirties, well I’m in better shape now, which isn’t saying much, I was kind of a nerd back then and didn’t do much exercising…
 Karen – Get on with it.
 Art – Ah yes, where was I?
 Karen – You were eventually going to inform me what you feel I should call you.

Shouting something in a guttural language neither understood, the orc charged.
 “Get back,” Harruq ordered as he shoved Qurrah to one side.
 He slammed himself against a house, barely dodging a downward chop of the blades.
 The orc attacked again, all his strength behind the swing.
 Harruq ducked, narrowly avoiding decapitation.
 Qurrah lunged before the orc could strike again, latching onto his wrist and letting dark magic flow.
 The orc howled at the sensation of a hundred scorpions stinging his flesh.
 Flooded with adrenaline, he hurled Qurrah aside, desperate to break the contact between them.
 Qurrah’s thin body crumpled against the dirt.
 At the sight of it, Harruq felt his rage break loose.

In the research, analysis, debate, consensus-building and actual operational activities of the United Nations System, the issues of peace, develop ment and democratization have been at the forefront.
 The Members of the International Commission on Peace and Food have interacted closely with the United Nations Funds, Programmes and Specialized Agencies.
 This report brings together many of the issues which are central to the reflection on development which the United Nations is trying to encourage, leading to the World Summit on Social Development to be held in 1995.
 Boutros Boutros-Ghali Secretary General United Nations
 The report of the International Commission on Peace and Food focuses on the 'uncommon opportunities' that have arisen as the world shifts into new alignments.
 These include the chance to tackle the problems of hunger and injustice at the root of so many of the global challenges confronting us not the least, the overriding challenge of nurturing a worldwide culture of peace.
 The Commission has put people first, recognizing that the greatest potential for change is within us, that with education and information we can mobilize the vast amounts of energy and skill which are currently wasted in the scramble for survival.
 It, nevertheless, also accepts that there are no easy solutions and that concerted action is necessary on many fronts in order to untangle the tortuous connections between, for instance, defence spending and food security, for no country can truly be said to be at peace while the violence of hunger blights the life of its citizens.
 ICPF has no hesitation in putting forward ideas that are bound to unsettle, and it should be encouraged since imagination and daring are precisely what we need at the present time.
 Its calls for a standing world army, for the recognition of full employment as a fundamental right and for the elimination of protectionist trade policies to mention but a few examples will cause some sharp intakes of breath among world leaders.

The poor body of the dwarf who had brought us here was lying in a contorted heap, limbs twisted in all directions.
 The scene was awful and I had to prevent myself from throwing up.
 Then I knew why they beat and killed him.
 All the other dwarves were on Kojas.
 This dwarf must have betrayed Kojas to bring information to whoever “her majesty” was and to help us into Igneeria.
 I suddenly knew that this dwarf was much braver than we had given him credit for.
 I suddenly felt awful because I knew who the thing was.
 Kojas.
 Chapter 7
 “The little traitor thought he could fool us,” Kojas announced, “but he was wrong.

 "You've never actually been on a school bus before, have you?"
 Rachel blushed a little bit.
 "Well, no not really.
 It should be fun still though, right?"
 I found myself returning her smile.
 You really couldn't spend any time around Rachel and not find yourself smiling.
 "Well, I've heard about bus trips that were extremely fun, but I've never been on one before.
 For me it's always been way too much time crammed into a relatively small space with fifty or sixty other people and no bathroom.

 But, well, eventually, I had to get Pete.
 Pete was Jim Dickinson’s friend.
 Jim’s a pure soul, a force for good, the Wise Man of the Forest, you know?
 He told me once, “Watch out for that shithead, Hudson.
 Just be careful.”  And then he said (laughs), “But, damn, isn’t that Kim a piece of work?” (laughs)

The two thousand obeyed, scattering in a constantly moving jumble of arms and legs.
 “That should help keep our presence hidden for a time,” Qurrah said.
 “They are but distractions.
 The darkness will hide us from their arrows.”
 Before Qurrah could ask what Velixar meant, his master was already in the midst of another spell.
 Inky darkness rose all about his feet, swirling like black floodwaters.
 Chills crept up his ankles as the liquid darkness grew.
 Velixar cried out the final words of the spell, spreading the darkness for a mile in all directions, so high it covered up to their necks.
 “It is cold,” Qurrah said, his teeth chattering.
 “You will not be harmed by it,” Velixar said, watching the approaching army.

 It’s all so effortless for him.
 And he lives it, music and spirituality, what we’re all really looking for, what we all really want our lives to be.

It had been said though.
 All there was left to do was hope he didn't decide I was the biggest loser to ever walk the earth.
 The extended silence was almost enough to make me decide he was going to get up and leave.
 "All right, I'll come over and lean against your bed, but you really need to try and sleep.
 You've got to be nearly exhausted."
 "What about you, mister superhero shape shifter?
 You've been up longer than I have.

 I tried not to let my voice get too sing-song, but I felt a completely irrational thrill as he quietly crossed over to my side of the room.
 "That's actually one of the benefits of my condition.

I don't remember everything about that night, I wasn't even conscious for a large part of the happenings, but the pieces I do remember are sharper than they should be.
 Sharper in my mind now maybe than even when they happened."
 Her hand gripped mine with a fragile strength that hinted at the vibrant, powerful woman she'd been back then.
 Back before the years had worn at her.
 "The pack was huge back then.
 Much larger even than Brandon's is today, but all of that might didn't save Alec's father that night.
 There was a nightmare of blood and death, and when the sun finally touched the earth again the next morning, a full third of our number were dead, and most of those who remained were crippled.
 I would've been one of the former, except for Donovan."
 The questions continued to bubble up inside me, but I throttled them down, suppressing them rather than risking an interruption which might cause her to not finish.
 "At great risk to himself he carried me away from the site of the battle, running and swimming more miles than I care to think about.

She was our class valedictorian in high school.
 When she gave her speech I wanted to stand up and say, “I love her.
 She gave me my first head.”  (laughs)  And I was voted, of course, “most talented.”  But, I’ve skipped ahead.
 We should spend more time in high school, if you know what I mean.
 It’s when I cut my teeth, honed my personality, became, for better or worse, what I became.
 Do you wanna start back in ninth grade now?
 CM:  	Sure.
 Yes.
 Exactly.
 I think when you were in ninth grade you were already something of a legend in Memphis Music circles.

Sure, it was hotter than Satan's kitchen, and a dermatologist's worst nightmare, but the skylines were amazing.
 Brandon opened his eyes as I let out a sigh of contentment.
 "Bored already?
 We're only halfway there."
 As I opened my mouth to respond, Vincent turned off the road onto a trail that hardly looked wide enough for a Geo Metro let alone his monster truck.
 I let out a yelp as we dropped down a small hill and then started climbing up the other side of the gully with a small bounce.
 Brandon chuckled at me, but shifted position enough to brace himself against the two beer kegs, and then reached out and wrapped an arm around me.
 A couple of the girls who'd been looking especially condescending over my surprise as we'd gone off-road were now obviously disappointed.
 They were probably wishing it was them instead of me cradled against Brandon's yummy chest.
 I tried not to radiate too much contentment, but rather suspected I failed.

Alec was barely even civil.
 He most definitely wasn't part of the support structure that'd been holding my world in its normal orbit, but suddenly my defenses were in danger of being breached.
 He looked up disinterestedly as I sat in my desk, and even that was enough to send little shivers of near pain coursing through my system.
 It wasn't real pain; I was still too cushioned from the world for that, but my body shied away from it just the same.
 I wanted to run screaming from the room, to jump through a window, to do anything to avoid coming into further contact with someone who so obviously hated me.
 The urges were all very real, but it was like I'd been drugged to the gills.
 I couldn't gather the energy to do anything about them.
 Instead my mind reached down and pulled extra layers of gauze over itself.
 I looked down at my Spanish test and wondered how I'd gotten here.
 There were answers on the page.

All of a sudden, Emily walked towards the dragon.
 Seth yelled at her to get back but she ignored him.
 She stood right in front of its head and opened her mouth, bizarre sounds started coming out.
 We all stood there mesmerized as she grunted, growled, snorted and hissed at the dragon.
 I expected it to just take a huge bite out of her, but it seemed as surprised as we were.
 “Emily, what's going on?” I shouted to her and started to walk over.
 Seth reached out and grabbed my arm.
 I spun around, suddenly annoyed.
 He shook his head and nodded over to the dragon.
 I looked and to my surprise it was bending down to let Emily stroke its head.

I stood there arms out in this parking lot surrounded by police, as they taped this wire to my body.
 Several cars drove slowly through the hotel parking lot, gawking.
 I stared back at them trying not to look ashamed, hoping one of my neighbors or clients didn’t drive by.
 It had to look like I was getting arrested!
 I could hear the police and undercover officers talking about me amongst themselves.
 In one exchange, a uniform officer asked an undercover officer what they busted me for and who I was turning on.
 The undercover officer told him I was the father of a kid they busted and I was “working my son’s deal.” The uniform officer responded that he had never heard of that before to which the undercover officer replied that this, as far as he knew, was a first.
 After I was wired, tested, and instructed to put my shirt and jacket back on, the briefing began.
 A loose circle of about a dozen officers stood between my truck and the van that would record the sting from the wire I was wearing.
 I would call the target soon and instruct her to meet me in a particular spot.

My head fell into my hands as I groaned.
 It took a while, but the anger eventually faded to a point where I realized I’d need a new plan.
 I couldn’t help but regret the flames had consumed the documents that had caused all this to begin with.
 I should have fully read them first.
 My heart tripped at the sound of cracking tinder beneath boot across the clearing.
 The fire had burned out, but the ashes were plenty evidence I’d been here.
 I ducked under the cover of a large spruce and watched.
 Chevelle walked through the tree line and my jaw clenched tight against a silent curse.
 He was alone.
 He kept walking as he looked my direction, surveying the damage from the fire.

Certain police or crime television shows would give us lumps in our throats as we would silently look at each other and know we were thinking the same thing… that might be our son.
 One afternoon while I was at work, Lisa was trying to help Brandon out by organizing some of his bills.
 Brandon told her that he needed to run a quick errand.
 She called me later that day and said she had lost track of him and he wasn’t returning her calls or answering his phone.
 All the usual horrible thoughts began to surface in our minds.
 The day turned into night and we still hadn’t heard from him.
 Close to midnight, as Lisa and I watched a movie together in the dark, there was a loud banging at our back sliding glass door.
 Our dogs went crazy—they were as startled as we were.
 Who the fuck was at our back door?
 It was Brandon’s druggie friend, high as a kite, rambling a mile a minute.

The elf stood and dressed, covering his white form in the red and black garb.
 Once dressed, Harruq gave him the ornate elven blade.
 “Your quest is a simple one,” he told his slave.
 “Go to Veldaren.
 Do whatever you must to sneak into the king’s castle.
 Kill if needed.
 When you find King Vaelor, wound him but do not kill him.
 Do not be captured, either.
 Die in combat.”
 Ahrqur nodded, his eyes seething.

Developing countries possess significant advantages in terms of climate, year-round production and low labour costs that are conducive to foreign investment.
 With private capital flows on the rise, there is an opportunity for developing countries to upgrade technology and obtain direct access to foreign markets by providing a conducive atmosphere for foreign investments and collaborations in agri-business ventures, such as hybrid seed production, flowers, processed fruit and vegetables, fresh and salt water aquaculture, and sericulture.
 Shift from commodity-based to resource-based planning
 The responsibility of governments to achieve dramatic increases in foodgrain production to keep pace with population growth naturally led to a commodity-based approach to agricultural development in many developing countries.
 Governments projected demand, set production targets for specific crops, and instituted programmes to help farmers produce the food needed to meet the minimum needs of the population.
 But once shortages are eliminated, the focus on specific commodities becomes a barrier to further agricultural development, because it retards diversification into more profitable commercial crops.
 Contrary to free market theory, farmers in many countries have tended to continue production of traditional crops, even when prices have fallen in response to increased supplies.
 There is still a need for government to educate and encourage farmers to adopt resource-based planning, oriented to national and international market potentials and based on principles of economics, employment and ecology.
 Resource-based planning examines how the available land and water resources can best be utilized to achieve maximum and sustainable economic return to the farmer, which is only rarely the priority of governments in developing countries that tend to focus on production targets for specific commodities.
 This shift can lead to diversification into commercial crops, such as fruit and vegetables, that generate significant increases in on-farm employment and incomes and act as a stimulus to downstream agro-industries.

"We might just have to make it a double wedding."

 "No, not yet.
 Carolyn and I are very serious, but I just couldn't think about proposing to her while you were still missing.
 But now .

 well, Mother has told me she's ready to give me the ring the moment I ask."

I suddenly knew that this dwarf was much braver than we had given him credit for.
 I suddenly felt awful because I knew who the thing was.
 Kojas.
 Chapter 7
 “The little traitor thought he could fool us,” Kojas announced, “but he was wrong.
 His death does not matter to me but what matters is what he could have said and done against us.
 He may have spilled too much.
 “But it does not matter!” he continued, his voice flowing with reassurance.
 “I have knowledge that the half-lings have entered our world and our grasp.
 The dwarf may have done us a favor, bringing them here, without knowing it.

The ugly creatures continued tugging at me like annoying two year old, which made me get really annoyed.
 “Get off me ugly looking toad dwarfs.
 Hey, that’s what I’ll call you, toad dwarfs.” I smiled at my quick thinking.
 I could be clever sometimes.
 Take that Seth.
 “Silly girl, we’re already called toad dwarfs.” The one on my leg croaked.
 “Aw darn, never mind then.” So much for being clever.
 The one on my back grabbed my hair.
 He yanked it back.

What sent us to the crusade began with Eric Curtis.
 As I pass the beach camp at San Onofre where Eric and I spent a couple of my happiest weeks, I silence my I-pod and remember.
 Superman
 I was fifteen when, on Christmas night, I lost my dad to a heart attack.
 He left my mom and me alone in our house on a hill a few miles north of Mexico and near enough to the Pacific so that when Santa Ana winds blew the gunk away, we could see ocean and islands.
 My mom was a rock.
 Over the past few years, before losing my dad, she had helped bury her father, a sister, and two brothers.
 She was the one who always fed me, nursed me, brought home a monthly check, and covered the debts my dad’s failed business ventures had accumulated.
 But soon after that dreadful Christmas, she got stricken by headaches and became a hermit.
 Evenings she would withdraw to her room and lie with a cool cloth on her forehead, listening to the Lakers, the Padres, or Dodgers, or to whomever the playoffs featured.

I settled for just nodding as I swapped books and slammed my locker shut.
 Alec pursed his lips for a second and then nodded, not at me, but at whatever decision he'd just made.
 "We'd better get you to your next class.
 Dealing with that will have to wait until later."
 I wanted to ask what he meant, but the halls were already full of other students, and I was pretty sure he'd tell me when he was ready and not a moment sooner anyways.
 With a sigh, I followed him into the crowd.
 A few minutes later I'd been handed off to my next babysitter, James this time, and was safely ensconced in Mr. Whethers' class.
 Mr. Whethers looked more than a little confused after reading James' note, but he simply added James' name to his roll, and then absently waved the two of us towards seats.
 I would've enjoyed English if not for the wildfire buzz created by my little scene with Alec outside of Biology.
 Mr. Whethers repeatedly asked various clumps of giggling and or staring girls to be quiet, but his efforts were largely wasted.

She still looked stern, but her face had relaxed slightly.
 She even smiled as she handed me a green, laminated card.
 "You'll need to pick out an empty table, we don't let students share here.
 Also I'd recommend choosing one somewhat distant from Ms. Samuels, she doesn't need any more distractions than she already has.
 When you have a question, or need help from one of the tutors, flip the card over to the red side and place it on your desk."
 I nodded and headed over to a table near the girl, one where I could watch her without her seeing me.
 I wasn't going to fall all over myself to become her friend or anything, but I figured it was worth observing her for a little bit.
 If she really was cool then we might strike up a friendship at some point.
 If she wasn't, then the sooner I could confirm that fact the better off I'd be.
 I pulled out my book, study guide, and some paper, and got busy with my next self-assigned homework set.

So like Doi’van, always thinking, Rodregas thought with a smile.
 “So first I make my infernal side more structured and then I become a part Nymph, a strange combination for a Hellborn.” Rodregas said, “I think we both feel the importance of the blessing and I thank you for sharing it.” She nodded and said, “I am so happy that I decided to go with you to sneak in, otherwise I would never have been able to receive the blessing of the One Tree.
 No matter how successful we are now against the Immortalists, I have been blessed as few of my people have.” Imeralda looked like she wanted to talk and Rodregas hated to break the mood, but they needed to get back to business.
 “We should return to the main chamber.
 The Grand Marshal will be coming soon for the official moment for me to take on a greater sigil, and I don’t think we want them to find these chambers.” As Rodregas walked from the chamber of the One Tree he felt more regret than when he had left the Infernal chamber; though in all likelihood the sigil from the Night Panther would prove to be of more use on his quest.
 The three walked as one to the Celestial Lion.
 They looked first at the great beast and then at Rodregas.
 “Are you sure I have the magical strength to take on two greater sigils?” he asked Imeralda.
 “Few have such strength; taking a second greater sigil seems to consume far more power than one.
 It is not just twice as much, but far more.

Doi’van looked at him for a second and said, “Two years ago.” “But that makes no sense,” Rodregas said, his voice angry though he did not know why.
 “The Guild is supposed to be trying to make their Immortalists members Celestial.
 Why would they hold you for two years?” Doi’van nodded but then shook his head.
 “Trust me, I would like to know that answer more then you.” Doi’van’s smile was now long gone and with a shrug of his huge misshaped shoulders, he changed the subject.
 “So, Imeralda, the stone here still seems strong and like new, though clearly, it has been long after the construction of this place.” She was looking at Doi’van strangely and it seemed to take her a moment to shift gears and answer his question.
 “Yes…of course construction like this…stone enchanted to absorb the power…it makes the stone stronger with that power.
 Stones formed like this will last as long as the ley line does not move, which happens only rarely and over centuries.
 What is strange is this is not a farm designed by Nymphs.
 The design of the home and barn is clearly human, yet it would be strange for a simple farmer to be able to afford to have his building built of Nymph stone and way up here in this remote place,” She said.
 “Sir Paladin,” Doi’van asked, “You said you traveled here the first time with friends.

The abandoned gas station stood on a corner in midtown Memphis like a sepulcher, but it was soon to be transmogrified into a holy place, a place where anything could happen so beware.
 A place as bright as Sun, as holy as Stax.
 It is where Black Lung was born.
 Today it is a Taco Bell.
 But some know.
 Some still pass it by and cross themselves, hearken back to the days of divination, the days when music could save a dying nation, a nation bent on its own self-immolation.
 That was the sixties.
 Even in Memphis, an outpost planet.
 A tributary, if you will.
 That first session, so it is told, was as if energy itself had been created in that concrete empty shell, where grass pushed through the floor, straining to catch these new vibes, this new electrical Jubal.

 I looked at the caller ID and it was Steve’s number, not Ashley’s.
 This was even better since the goal was to get him and she was ancillary.
 I picked up the phone, which was still connected to the recording device, and she introduced herself and said she was calling from her boyfriend’s phone because hers was broken.
 The call went better than expected as you could hear Steve coaching her in the background.
 Ashley fell nicely into all of the comments the police wanted to record.
 I was told by Officer White to tell her I could meet her in a couple of days as I was out of town.

Before I'd even regained my balance, he was walking away, moving so quickly I would've needed to run to keep up.
 Even so, he hadn't turned away quick enough to hide the complete disdain in his expression.
 I suddenly found myself wishing I'd told him the truth rather than making him think I was stupid and manipulative.
 It was too late.
 He was already out of sight, and by now his opinion of me was fixed.
 Chapter 4 School hadn't gotten any worse after I'd convinced the hottest boy on the planet that I was a complete waste of oxygen, but it hadn't gotten any better either.
 Mrs. Tiggs, my Spanish teacher, had seemed every bit as mean as my Biology teacher from earlier in the day, and it had been a relief when Britney had finally dropped me off at home.
 I watched Britney's little white Saturn disappear down the lane with a complex set of feelings that included a bit of loneliness and more than a little relief.
 After a minute or two spent staring off into space, I finally decided the discomfort in my stomach was sharp enough to justify the effort of eating.
 Given the ridiculous heat, studying was the last thing I wanted to do, but there wasn't really anything else to do so I changed into cooler clothes and made the best of it.

He didn’t hear me, or look up.
 I wasn’t mad at him anymore for not telling me what I wanted to know.
 Now I felt bad that I had nagged him so hard that he was breaking.
 I walked over to him and wrapped my arms around his body.
 He stopped crying and I felt him squirm.
 Seth grunted and then mumbled, “Get off me.” “No, not until you tell me what’s going on,” I said.
 He groaned.
 “Seriously Jazell, nothing is wrong.
 Now get off me.” I rolled my eyes but he couldn’t see that.
 “You’re a horrible liar Seth.” “I know,” I felt him sigh.

The recent calamities in Rwanda and Somalia following the outbreak of civil and ethnic war, and in Bosnia following the breakaway of several Yugoslav republics, demonstrate the need for substantially improving international mechanisms for war prevention, peacemaking and peace keeping, and for protection of basic human rights both between and within states.
 The effort of the international community to deal with these events has brought to the fore fundamental issues regarding national sovereignty and the responsibilities of the world community.
 The very definition and sanctity of the state have been blurred by the determination of ethnic groups in various nations to declare independence from their parent bodies, and the inability or unwillingness of national governments to maintain law and order and provide basic security for their citizens.
 The role of other states, regional organizations and international agencies in giving explicit or implicit support to these movements has further complicated the task of formulating just and practical solutions.
 These events raise questions about the rights of both nations and their citizens that have to be addressed theoretically before the role of international organizations in these affairs can be determined properly.
 Does a minority group within a country have the right to proclaim itself independent on the basis of its desire for self-governance and in defiance of the claims of the majority on the property and resources they possess?
 Does a national government, whether elected or in power by force, that is unable to protect its citizens against famine and civil strife have the right to insist on its sovereignty and independent action in the face of the persecution or extermination of its own people?
 What is the responsibility of the international community for preventing or alleviating crises within societies?
 What should be the limits placed on international involvement in the internal affairs of countries that, at least momentarily, are unable to help themselves?
 The sanctity of the sovereign state, like the sanctity of private property in a capitalist society, is a fundamental principle of the nation state system on which the present world community is based.

She was smiling a touch as she reached a hand across her waist, closing her fist around a black hoop I’d not seen before.
 She drew it out and around as a long black trail curved in its wake and came to rest at her side.
 My mouth went dry.
 A whip.
 Oh yes, this would hurt.
 I loosed my cloak and pitched it aside, lowering myself in a defensive stance, hands out and ready.
 Crack!
 Okay, not ready.
 “Ow!

This was highlighted by the similarly colored silk toga he wore.
 He wore no rings or accessories, his outfit simple, but extravagant.
 Van’dret suddenly wished he had thought to dress simpler for the occasion his green and emerald outfit with its gold trim seemed garish in comparison; and his human male form that normally seemed attractive and robust seemed ungainly and drab in comparison.
 Taiga’s manner continued to be friendly but inquisitive.
 The conversation started with a polite discussion on new spells that Van’dret was working on, and then moved to his thoughts on the recent political and economic tensions with the Romig Empire.
 Wine and food appeared on the table; Van’dret never saw it come, or the empty plates go.
 It simply was.
 The food, like everything in the tower, was of the finest quality.
 They were fed incredible grilled silver salmon, greens from the Northern Kingdoms, and small pastries from the Korin Islands.
 Taiga seemed in no hurry to get to any point, Immortalist had nothing, if not time.

 They’re all he needs.

He added the coin purses to the robe he was wearing.
 He still needed more hard money and some decent clothes.
 Rodregas looked out the window to see a few people leaving the keep grounds, and a few still hanging around the yard.
 He knew he could not leave without everyone seeing him.
 He searched the rest of the study in the daylight.
 He found nothing of real use until he pulled a drawer completely out of the desk and found a false back to the drawer.
 He found it was holding a purple silk purse containing eight pieces of gold and two of silver.
 Now he had the money he needed to be on the run.
 After forcing himself to wait until the last visible person left the main gate, Rodregas grabbed the trunk and went to the stairs.
 He listened quietly, and hearing nothing, he set the trunk down and quietly walked down the stairs.

“Are you ill?” Chevelle said from beside me.
 I hadn’t even heard him come in.
 He was sitting forward on the bench next to me and when I jerked up in surprise, it put us too close.
 I tottered and he steadied me, but didn’t move away.
 He leaned closer.
 “You smell… like morning.” I bit my lip, heat rising up my neck, but he lingered, breathing in the scent.
 “Ruby,” I said.
 He looked confused.
 “Soap.” I had been reduced to one-word sentences.
 “Oh.” He nodded, leaning back.

 Jim – Eugene has two major skills as far as I know.
 (A moment of silence)
 Johnny – What are they?
 Jim – Oh, I thought we had gone over this before.
 Johnny – Not that I recall.
 What is Gene good at?
 Jim – His two super-powers are his wondrous ability to bull-shit and the propensity not to be bothered by being completely embarrassed when he gets himself into extremely awkward and stupid situations.

What are you then?”
 “I am a half-orc,” Qurrah said.
 His shoulders hunched, and his head lowered as a reluctant bit of shame stung his words.
 “The blood of both elves and orcs fills my veins.”
 He expected to be scoffed, mocked, or banished.
 Instead, Velixar laughed.
 “Such blasphemy against the elven goddess,” he said.
 “Appropriate, so appropriate.
 You have sworn your life to me, half-orc.
 You should learn what you stand to gain.”

He disappeared before I could notch an arrow and shoot him.
 Soon we were alone again.
 Emily made us all meet by the fountain.
 I guess we all heard some weird dwarf talk.
 “Okay I’ll start this time.
 He said, ‘Kill all the dwarfs you like, but Kojas will rise.’ At least we have an idea of who they might be talking about.” She added to her list; Toad dwarf said, “Kill all you like but Kojas will rise.” Is Kojas the person they’ve been talking about?
 Who is he?
 “He told me, ‘The one will rise, the one rise!
 He will destroy you!’ That’s almost the same thing as last time.” I tapped the fountain.
 She scribbled, Toad dwarf said, “The one will rise, the one will rise!

No white polyester pants here!
 My best friend Pete and I opened a waterbed and hot tub store in North Lake Tahoe called Sierra Waterbeds and Hot Tubs— a venture his father funded.
 I was selling waterbeds and this new invention called a portable hot tub.
 Pete and I still drank and partied and the drugs were still around.
 Unlike most of the people I knew, I managed to be truly a recreational user with no tendencies towards addiction.
 But I am no prude, and we had our share of parties and events in Tahoe and at the waterbed store.
 When you put a bunch of twenty year olds and their friends in a retail store that has working hot tubs and waterbeds, things can quickly spiral out of control.
 We had no window coverings and our parties were in plain view of anyone who put their nose against the windows.
 It was a voyeurs’ paradise and I am sure we entertained a lot of shocked window shoppers late into the night!
 Pete proved to be a bad choice of a business partner, as his use of cocaine escalated to the point of total addiction.

 Rick blinked hard.
 Something was wrong.
 The fog, which had been dissipating, was getting denser.
 It shrouded most of his garden, including his electric fountain, which he could no longer hear.
 It was 1927.
 Rick caught his breath, trying to see through the fog.
 He knew that the door .

For a price, yes.
 Those last songs, dripping with feigned self-pity, seem apocalyptic in retrospect.
 “Allison All Gone” and “Goodbye to the Shell” especially appear to comment on Buddy’s desire to burn his bridges, leave his Memphis past behind, forget his roots.
 And, of course, then there’s “Burn my Bridges” and “Forget my Roots” off the second album.
 Even Buddy’s skillful acoustic playing can’t save those albums from their own wallowing, from their stooping to the lowest common denominator.
 Of course they sold.
 They were huge.
 Buddy played with Carole King, with the L.A.
 Session, with Linda Rondstadt.
 He was revered, honored (Grammy for “Song for L. Enos,” 1971), patted on his self-satisfied back.

My backpack was slung over my shoulder, filled with my writing books and sketchpads.
 I kept my eyes on the shadowed road, watching my every step.
 Usually I was more aware of my surroundings, but today I was tired and didn’t care if I rammed into a tree.
 I kicked a rock into the grass.
 The sun was starting to set, painting the sky in brilliant oranges and reds.
 It slipped down the sky, allowing the first stars to peek out from behind the bright curtain.
 The remaining light cast shadows over everything, creating the illusion that there was double of everything.
 The world prepared to go into its hours of unreal silence that made it seem magical, and it really was.
 My phone buzzed and I awoke from my trance.
 I thumbed the keypad and opened the message Seth had sent me.

That was when she begged me to wire the house for sound.
 Donovan and I spent two weeks setting up mics in Mom's studio, and then another couple of weeks running sound into every other room of the house.
 She kept insisting it was so she could monitor Mother on the rare occasions when nobody else was home, but I used to hear her trying to play along to 'Courtship'."
 The trace of a smile on Alec's face lulled me into a false sense of security.
 "She doesn't play now though.
 I've been into her room, and there's no violin there."
 "No, she doesn't play anymore.
 She stopped playing shortly after Mom finished up the piece you just heard."
 His expression was so serious now that I almost stopped him before he could continue.
 "She stopped when she realized that 'Welcoming' was the only celebration of childbirth mother was going to write."

It isn't like anyone is going to pull us over and give us a ticket."
 It was more difficult than I expected to formulate a coherent answer while fighting off the first quivering indications of another attack.
 "She's right, Rachel.
 You should be buckled in."
 I expected her to argue with him.
 No girl on the planet liked it when her older brother sided with her friends against her, but Rachel just frowned a little before scooting back so she could do up her seatbelt.
 Was she really that scared of him?
 I stole a glance at him out of the corner of my eye.
 He didn't look threatening, well, at least no more so than usual.
 Anyone with that many muscles was at least a little threatening.

He had not felt such hormonal surges in a long time.
 He made a decision in his head.
 He had carefully been a gentleman now for several weeks and had not tried anything with the beautiful half AElf, but her teasing expression left him an opening.
 He decided to take advantage of it.
 He spoke very slowly and carefully, letting her know that he knew what he was saying.
 “Actually, I was looking at you, you are amazingly beautiful.
 Your incredible eyes and hair, you are breathtaking.” Rodregas looked at her, his eyes going slowly over her entire body as he spoke.
 Then he shifted his gaze toward Imeralda’s large green eyes.
 As their eyes held he slid over to her, running the back of his hand across her cheek.
 “You are so beautiful, your skin so soft,” Rodregas said.

"Break it up!
 You kids back off!"
 The words seemed to float in from far away.
 They certainly didn't have an effect on any of the shape shifters.
 Vincent was moving too slowly for my human eyes to detect any change, but I was sure he was closer now than the last time I'd looked.
 The feeling of insects marching across my skin intensified as James started shaking.
 Jasmin and Dominic both followed suit within seconds, and the feeling doubled as several of Brandon's wolves went into near convulsions.
 "I said break it up!"
 Mr. Paterson shoved his way past a pair of Brandon's wolves, and for a split second I thought they were going to turn and kill him.
 A heartbeat before they moved a low, barely perceptible growl washed over the entire scene.

"Mmm--this is delicious."
 "Good.
 Do you want milk or juice or both?"
 They chatted as they ate, and only when she began loading the dishwasher did she remember that she was going to have to spend the day alone.
 "What should I do while you're gone, Rick?"
 "Whatever you like.
 You can see if I have any books that interest you, or you can watch television.
 There are frozen dinners in the freezer that you can put in the microwave for lunch.
 Just be sure to read the directions and remember not to put anything metal in it.
 I'll show you how to call me at work in case you need something."

The chaotic and destructive nature of the infernal does not lead to the necessary discipline that is required to be an Immortalist.
 A mortal must choose only one path; Celestial or Infernal.
 That is ‘The One Law.’” “Why?” asked Doi’van, his deep voice sounding both menacing and curious.
 “Nobody knows for sure,” said Jordaan.
 “The Gods and Infernals do not explain their actions, but most believe that if someone had the full potential to tap into all three… he would be stronger than either the Gods or the Greater Daemons.
 He would have the potential to rule all the realms and break the great balance.
 This is something that not even the Infernals want,” he added.
 Rodregas spoke, “So if Ravenhurr, who was a friend of Taiga, was part of a group of Immortalists who are breaking ‘The One Law’ then he might have already added Hellborn power to his own.
 And when I took on Ravenhurr’s power, I also added the Infernal power, which is natural for a Hellborn.
 It could also be a reason that the gods answered my prayers and helped me succeed against Ravenhurr.” “So the Gods might not be against all Immortalists, but just the ones who are tapping into the Infernal power?” asked Doi’van.

He looked around the dimly lit cavern and spotted Jazell, sprawled out on the floor.
 He crawled over to her.
 *** I couched and gagged, turning over.
 Dirt fell to the ground from my dry mouth.
 I looked over to see Seth fall back on the ground, breathing heavily.
 I looked around the room and up at the sky, but I couldn't really see it.
 “Seth, where are we?” I asked, my voice hoarse.
 He sat up.
 “I think we're in some underground cave.
 When the ground collapsed, it must have carried us here.” “That stinks,” I said.

"Whatever.
 Like your brother is any better."
 I turned and went out through the exterior door.
 I was all the way out to the parking lot before I realized that I didn't have a way home.
 I was still trying to figure out what to do, when I heard the deep roar of a high-performance engine.
 Brandon was clear over at the other end of the parking lot, but somehow he saw me and flipped his car around.
 "You're looking just a little stranded."
 "That obvious?"
 His smile was just as radiant and reassuring as always.
 "Only to someone who happens to know your entire schedule, and who just saw what looked like Rachel and James leave without you."

Guess what.
 I traded tickets with Suzanne Bergerman, so we get to sit together!"
 Life couldn't get any better.
 I was going to Les Misérables with Rachel, and I only had two more hours before Brandon would be taking me home.
 Chapter 16 My time with Brandon blurred by too quickly.
 It was like the time between when he picked me up and dropped me off didn't even exist.
 One moment I'd be blah and mundane, then next I'd be with him and the world was perfect.
 When I was by myself, it was hard to believe it all hadn't been a dream.
 Thursday morning flew by, it was like I blinked and it was already time for Mrs. Campbell's class.
 A number of the other girls, and even a couple of the guys, stopped by my desk before the bell rang to congratulate me on winning the last ticket to Les Misérables.

He was there, waiting for me.
 The pain in my chest dulled a little.
 Or maybe it was only overwhelmed by a new pressure.
 I crossed to him slowly.
 Junnie was all I’d had since I came here and now she was gone.
 For a hundred years, she’d be gone.
 I wanted nothing more of Fannie.
 Nothing more of any of this.
 I didn’t know what I would do, but by the time I reached Chevelle, I knew what I wanted: to retrieve my mother’s things from the vault.
 I would leave this wretched place behind.

Liz – He’s not going to get himself hurt is he?
 Jim – Hard to say, this has got to be more harmless than some of the other things he was doing though.
 Most likely he’ll just get chased off by some angry tourists.
 Liz – What’s he done that is worse than this?
 And what did he mean when he said ‘you’re good at this sort of thing.’
 Jim – He didn’t mean anything by it.
 Liz – He meant something by it, otherwise he wouldn’t have said anything.
 Now what did you do?
 Jim – you know Gene, he says thing all the time.
 He was just being Gene.

And I sang it again.
 It was just heart wrenching, man, I mean, we were just like two kids given a new lease on life.
 I wrote a song, I kept, thinking.
 I wrote a damn good song.
 I was back, you know, back, but different.
 Different but the same.
 This is what I want everyone to understand.
 What I want to say—the difference is not a drama, the difference is a poem, a song, a way of looking at life, that’s slightly atilt, slightly askew, perhaps, but it’s all me, you know?
 It’s what I am.
 I am a songwriter.

 It might well have been since Mother really didn’t want that one in the show, but it has made a lot of people laugh, and the posters of it are selling well.

 Liz – For you, it’s on the house, and I’ll sign it as well.
 Jim – Woo-hoo!
 I feel special now.
 Liz – You are special.
 Jim – It’s all the paint-chips I ate as a kid, with the right dip they’re pretty good.

Did he want to share the mattress with her?
 He did of course, but this was a time of new beginnings.
 Rodregas would live and die like he had always meant to.
 He walked back to the wagon, grabbed another blanket and put it down far enough away from Imeralda to show his honorable intentions.
 But not too far in case there was trouble.
 With a big smile he laid down and slept, like he had not slept in a very long time.
 CHAPTER 6 LUNCH WITH THE ENEMY
 With an eager stride, Van’dret climbed up the stairs to the rooftop solar of the Guild Dealer Taiga’s tower fortress...
 He was excited by the honor to dine with the great Immortalist.
 He followed a servant dressed in expensive silks of a drab brown color through the well lit passageways and stairs, all the while nervously straightening his own expensive wardrobe.

Even on lesser matters than Zoë, such as writing books and building the Perelandra College writing programs (another of my obsessions), I hesitate to cut back in order to devote more time to communing with God.
 Even during these meditative times on the road, since Pismo Beach I have devoted as much to thoughts of the book that will come of the journey as to whether it all will help me live more like Brother Lawrence.
 I wonder, if I were given the choice between writing a wonderful book or achieving deeper communion, which would I choose?
 The woman I call Sweet still haunts me.
 I imagine if some good Christian folks would suggest that God might have sent her to me, others would assure me she was in the devil’s employ.
 Whether she came from God, the devil, or by pure coincidence is academic to me.
 If instead of her, Father Abraham would’ve appeared and reminded me that he was willing to not only surrender his son but to impale and burn his own child, I wouldn’t for a moment consider following his lead, even as far as the give her up part.
 These days, with my big kids and Pam off in the world on their own, Zoë is my only real treasure.
 Around the time she was born, I often wrote for the San Diego Reader.
 My editor asked me for a story they would call “Old Man, New Baby”.

“Okay,” I said.
 “But check this out, everything looks weird.
 I mean, awfully weird.” “How so?” “Well, awfully bright, way more beautiful, only scarier.
 Something like that.” “Probably tequila,” he said.
 “Maybe.” But it wasn’t.
 Tequila doesn’t last.
 The Real World
 I started college and rented an apartment with Kenny Niedermeyer who was suffering more than any of us over Eric’s death, since the car was his and Sylvia blamed him.
 She would call and scream “Murderer!” and accuse him of stealing the twenty dollars Eric took with him that day.
 Here's something she wrote and sent him: Jingle for Rope Jumpers Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear, Eric's dead.

“Don’t worry, sunshine, I will see you again.” I smiled a little and he winked at me.
 Chevelle stiffened at my side as he often did when Steed touched me so casually, and I couldn’t help but think of being alone with him after tonight.
 My stomach tightened and suddenly in comparison the mountains didn’t seem like such a big deal.
 The next morning Steed said goodbye privately to Chevelle and then came to where I stood with the horses, stroking one’s neck.
 “You’ll remember me, butterfly?” I smiled in return.
 “Always.” “Yes, well, at least as long as he’s yours.” He patted the horse.
 “Mine?” He smiled and swung onto his horse, nodding farewell as he spun and galloped east.
 My horse knelt and Chevelle offered his hand to help me get seated.
 My grin widened as he mounted his horse and he looked back at me questioningly.
 “I’ll name him Steed,” I announced proudly.

Marie heard obscenities and shouting, and she saw two different actors storm off two different sets in the middle of their scenes.
 But it was wonderful.
 The actors and actresses were very attractive people, and many of them were nice to her.
 "Today was magic, absolute magic," Marie sighed as they ate steak and salad that evening.
 Rick smiled.
 "You weren't disappointed then?"
 "Not in the slightest."
 "It was what you expected?"
 "No, not really.
 But it was just as exciting."

Altamount followed.
 Manson.
 Things were getting grim.
 More and more people in the street but it didn’t look like those fuckers in Washington were gonna do a damn thing different—the war, shit, look at it, it’s just deeper and deeper shit.
 And they were turning hoses on kids.
 Chicago happened, Abbie was arrested and tried.
 They tied a man to a chair—this was 1968, man, not 1868.
 I was aghast, the whole country was aghast, I mean, those who cared.
 It seemed the vultures had descended and taken over.
 They were picking the bones of America, licking their slathering jaws and, well, it all was just so bleak bleak bleak.

The room had its own full-length mirror and I giggled at my reflection.
 It was certainly not an outfit I’d choose for myself.
 I couldn’t say I looked bad though.
 I turned away, still painfully unaccustomed to my new appearance, and tugged down the hem of the short leather top.
 Steed let out a whistle as I entered the main room.
 Ruby sat beside him, a warm smile on her face as if we were old friends.
 Chevelle was near a window on the front wall, leaning on one shoulder, his body turned toward me, expression impossible to read.
 “Better?” Ruby asked.
 “Yes, thank you.” I was polite, but it burned a little to thank her after what she’d done.
 Steed smiled, shaking his head from side to side with exaggerated slowness.

I was scrutinizing his blade.
 “Oh, well, I’m hunting.” He wasn’t as slow as I had thought, quite capable of conversation.
 I couldn’t help but wonder, “You were a bit… stunned before?” He flushed a pleasing shade of red.
 “Yes.” “Why?” “Well, it’s just that you are quite beautiful.
 Surely the loveliest thing I have ever seen.” I smiled in spite of myself and he continued the flattery.
 “And then when you spoke, your voice… it’s like a melody.” “And you are seeking a new camp?” “A more permanent settlement, actually.” “You have found it here?” “We are undecided.
 Days ago we were attacked.” Pain washed his features.
 “A horrid creature took several of our men.” I nodded.
 “An imp.” “I’d never believed it to be true if I hadn’t seen it myself.” He was lost in thought as he continued, “We may move again.
 The risk seems too great.” Suddenly, I didn’t want them to relocate.

He was so enthusiastic and so different.
 Although he was excited to see us, he was calm and collected.
 He was respectful to all and excited to show off his family, he seemed to know everyone.
 We met many of the people who we spoke with on the phone and got to put their faces with their names.
 Every worker we met was a recovering drug addict and a one-time student of Narconon.
 People from all walks of life, from all over the country and all ages; it was a mosaic of America’s addicts trying to change their lives.
 The longer the students were there, the more naturally they mentored the new arrivals.
 After about a half hour visiting the center, the facility had transformed for us— from a roadside dive motel to an oasis of healing.
 We took Brandon out to Thomas’s for Easter brunch, about an hour away.
 In that hour, a young man, our son, was in our vehicle and he spoke with confidence and newfound wisdom about what he was learning and how he was being taught to apply it to real life situations.

 "Aren't you going to the office, Father?"
 "The day I get my daughter back?
 Not likely."
 John stood then.
 "May I assume then that it's permissible for me to take the day off, Father?"
 Marie stared at her brother.
 "You've joined Father's company?"
 "Yes.

“I’m not like the others.”
 “That so?” Alvrik’s face hadn’t changed in the slightest.
 “Tell me why.”
 “Stronger,” he said.
 “Tougher.
 Whatever work you got two men doing, I can do alone.
 Whatever hours you got them working, I can do double.”
 “A large boast,” Alvrik said.
 He took the bone out of his mouth and pointed at Harruq’s ears.
 “You got orc blood in you.”

The rest of us were quick to pipe in, but at least on my side, the sentiment was a little half-hearted.
 Unlike Jasmin, Jessica never had come around, never made her peace with the fact that because of me things were going to go downhill in a hurry after tonight.
 I'd tried to get both Rachel and Dominic to explain why she hated me so much, but neither would give me a real explanation.
 Rachel would always just get mad and say there was no excuse for how Jess was acting.
 Dominic always refused to say anything other than that Jessica had been through her own set of struggles, and had her reasons for her behavior.
 "I'll be done with Dom in just a moment, Jess, then I'll fix your hair while Rachel finishes up with Adri."
 The nickname should have hurt, but somehow it wasn't as bad when the pack used it.
 It was almost like having a new family, one without all of the grief-poisoned memories that popped up every time I really thought about Dad or Cindi.
 Faster than I would've believed possible, we were all in our dresses, and waiting in the living room for the boys to make their appearance.
 Jasmin and Rachel had worked what I was pretty sure was actual magic.

Eugene – Fredric beat me.
 At first he just yelled at me, and beat mom.
 Then after mom disappeared he turned his full wrath to me.
 I think I was five at the time.
 It was like a week after she didn’t come home, he blamed me for it, I don’t remember much after the first few kicks.
 I think I passed out.
 When I woke up it was days later, I think, hard to be sure.
 He just left me to fend for myself, he didn’t care enough to do anything to help, he just left me lying on the floor.
 I still have some of the scars, most have faded, except for some of the burns he gave me.
 Jim – You ok Gene?

The day was almost done, the town covered with long shadows and darkened spaces.
 The older boys and girls would still be out to play, but the younger ones…
 Harruq stopped.
 Aurelia positioned herself to the side, struggling to keep her breathing calm lest she alert him to her presence.
 They were beside an old house made of slanted boards shoddily nailed together.
 There was no glass for the window, nor a covering.
 She wondered what the occupants did during the winter months, preferring her mind dwell on that than the terrible look marring Harruq’s face.
 His skin had turned ashen.
 His right hand stroked the hilt of his sword like an itch he couldn’t ignore.
 He put a hand on the wood.

It was hard to tell for sure what it was from so far away, but it wasn't plastic.
 The cool ovals where the sole had been cut away to reveal the material underneath told me that much.
 Whatever it was, it'd been created in layers.
 The outermost material was achingly clear, while the inner layers seemed increasingly less so.
 Alec waited, another smile playing about his lips, while I came to terms with the shoes.
 He then deftly slipped the other shoe onto my right foot, and steadied me as I tried to adjust to suddenly being almost six inches taller.
 "They're perfect.
 Thank you."
 Rachel ducked around her brother so she could see the shoes and then smiled before leaning in to whisper.
 "Mom wore those to the Ashure Day Dance, the one where she fell in love with Dad."

He looked at me from the corner of his eye.
 “Obviously, why else would they say that the 'King' would underestimate them?” “You make a good point,” I said.
 “Why did the syphon attack you?” I lowered my voice so only he could hear me.
 “I thought you said they wouldn't attack you.” He looked uneasy.
 “The syphon said he would be rewarded for grabbing me.
 I think he wasn't trying to kill me but trying to knock me out.” “So he could bring you to Kojas.” He nodded but he seemed somewhere else.
 He sighed and said, “I hope they won't go too far to achieve that, or it'll get harder to hide this from Emily and Jason.” I crossed my arms.
 “I told you that we should tell them.
 But you still refuse to let me-” “No,” he said sternly.
 “No and that's that.” “Fine,” I said and threw my arms in the air.

I mean, sure, open your mind, yeah, that’s psychedelia’s code-word.
 I wrote “Strawberry Fields for a While” on acid, appropriately.
 I mean, I did it on purpose.
 I wanted to answer John, send him a valentine as it was, and I thought, well, I should be tripping because that’s such a trippy song, you know?
 So, I did that.
 I used grass a lot, still do.
 Can you print that?
 (laughs) Can they arrest me if you print that?
 When I was with other musicians, I mean, it was something you just did.
 At the bed-in, I mean everyone was tripping.

Only this time, I talked to the ghost girl.” “You did?
 What did she say?” “She hinted that she knew who made us this way and who attacked us that day,” I said.
 “She also said that Kojas would use our emotions against us and try to get us to come to him.” Something dark crossed Seth's face.
 “She also said that we were chosen because of our strong bond, but she said, not to test it,” I continued.
 “She also told me not to go into the shadows.” Seth stretched.
 “So the usual confusion?” “I got more this time, Seth.
 Anyway, do you have any information to offer here?” I asked with an edge to my voice.
 Seth put his arms in surrender.
 “Hey, don't start yelling at me.
 We were getting a long pretty well last night, let's keep it that way.” I felt my face flush when I remembered last night.

"But you will.
 And so will I.
 We're both young.
 We'll end up settling for someone we love less than we love each other, just so we won't be alone."
 "No!"
 She began crying so hard that she became ill and had to jump up and run to the bathroom.
 Rick got up and followed her.
 He wet a washcloth for her and one for himself.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, handing her a washcloth as she straightened.
 "I should keep all these disturbing thoughts to myself."

See if  you can find out who people want to win and why?” Imeralda was clearly confused by the odd request, but nodded, and after a little talk she slipped away to the food line and within moments was in an animated discussion with a few squires at another table.
 Rodregas thought Doi’van might ask, but he showed no interest and instead said, “While most of the knights are too high and mighty to talk to a Hellborn, the staff is not so closed mouthed.
 The greater sigils are said to be guarded twenty four hours a day in a great chamber in the very heart of the Cathedral.” “And did you ask if sworn men were allowed in with a new knight?” asked Rodregas with a smile.
 “Actually the topic did come up,” said Doi’van with a chuckle like rocks in a land slide.
 “While guards are usually not allowed in, it is not unusual for close friends or advisors to go in with some of those of the blood; to share their wisdom on the best possible greater sigils to take on.” “I will assume,” said Rodregas, “that they had never heard of a Nymph entering the chamber, much less one of the Hellborn?” “AElves are not uncommon and actually more Orqui than I expected.
 One servant thought that Nymphs used to go in during his father’s, father’s time, but not any time recently.
 No one could even imagine a Hellborn going into the Chamber,” agreed Doi’van.
 “Well as far behind as we are, we might not even get the chance to try to bully our way in,” Rodregas said.
 Doi’van nodded and that comment seemed to end the conversation.
 As Rodregas headed out to the sands of the Cathedral arena for the jousting match, he was relieved to see Imeralda waiting at the entrance to talk to him.

That was interesting.
 Clearly Imeralda would have the power to sense the stream of magic, but Doi’van had seemed equally effected.
 She turned to Rodregas; her eyebrows arched high in surprise and said, “A ley line and powerful?
 I knew there were several going through the Aridas, but your little abandoned farm is next to a ley line?” she asked.
 “Actually,” Rodregas said, “it is right in the middle of it, and there is even a small undercurrent suggesting that another weaker one crosses at the farm point.” Rodregas explained, “I had been on the run when we found this place.
 I had been worried that those tracking me were using magic.
 So to keep them off my track I traveled in and out of ley lines to throw off the magic scent.
 This one runs underground before coming out in this small valley.
 I was trying to find the ley line again.
 That is how I found the old farmhouse.” Ley lines are like rivers of magic energy that encircle the world.

But you did jump like one.” Jason's face went red.
 “I thought I'd get some support from you, Seth.” He crossed his arms.
 “You might be next, you know.” Seth shrugged.
 “Maybe, but I don't care.
 We all need a good laugh to keep our spirits up and if that means scaring the crap out of me, I'm fine with it.” “So you'll be fine with me dragging you outside while you were sleeping and leaving you in the rain?” Emily asked.
 Seth narrowed his eyes.
 “No, I'd be cold, wet and annoyed.
 You can do that if you feel like having me be grouchy all day.” “Nah,” Emily said.
 “I don't think it would be worth it.” “Are we just going to sit here and talk or are we going to get a move on?” I asked.
 “Alright then,” Emily said and walked out of the cave.

But these positive trends are no grounds for complacency.
 While they may dispel fears of an irreversible shrinkage of the job market in OECD countries, the proportion of long term unemployed remains at an unacceptably high 29 per cent of the total, indicating that these countries have not yet evolved successful strategies to address the issue.
 Left to itself, unemployment may continue to deprive large numbers of people in these countries from enjoying basic economic rights, unless concerted steps are taken to remove the perceptual and structural barriers to full employment.
 While data on unemployment levels in most developing countries is of doubtful accuracy and recent data are difficult to obtain, there is no question that the problem remains severe, especially among youth and the educated.
 ILO estimated that at the end of 2000 approximately 110 million workers in developing countries, excluding Central and Eastern Europe, were unemployed, most of them first-time jobseekers.
 Unemployment rates among young workers are almost everywhere at least twice as high as the average.
 In addition another 500 million workers in the developing world earned less than a dollar a day.
 Although the growth rate of the world's labour force is slowing down, approximately 460 million additional jobseekers will enter the global labour force between 2000 and 2010, two-thirds in Asia.
 ILO has concluded that the prospects for an improving global employment situation depend mainly on continued expansion of the world economy.
 While that expansion is likely, economic growth alone will not be sufficient to provide opportunities for sustainable livelihood for all those who need it.

 She felt guilty for spying on him, but Aurelia was convinced she had no other choice.
 Over the past month, she had grown close to the half-orc Harruq Tun, and with that closeness was danger.
 She saw only a goofy young man while Dieredon swore she met with a killer.
 Only one of them could be right, but who?
 Perhaps not, she wondered.

In addition to their martial prowess and training they are all sigil warriors and use enchanted armor to increase their effectiveness.
 The Celestial Gods pick their Paladins from their membership.
 Sigil Warriors - Those who are born with magical talent but do not wish to be sorcerers have the opportunity inscribe a sigil on their magic talent that uses up a portion of their magical ability.
 Lesser sigils are simple such as health, strength, quickness.
 Greater Sigils are more complex and can mimic the powers of Celestial Beast or Infernal Daemons.
 Dire Beast - Are common mortal animals that have breed with either a celestial beast or an infernal daemon.
 Dire Beast who are of the Blood are direct descendent while, a regular dire beast will be several generation removed but still show signs of their ancestry.
 Night Bronze - a heavy armor usually only worn by warriors who are either part Celestial or are Hellborn or have a Sigil of Strength due to its heavy weight.
 The metal is highly magical and can hold powerful enchantments.
 Though very strong it does not hold an edge well and is seldom used to produce an edged weapon.

He looked to the stars.
 Even as a child, those far away lights had awakened something in him, something so different from what he thought he was.
 Right then, it was awakening guilt and fear.
 “I do what I choose,” he argued to the stars.
 “No, what I _must_.”
 The words felt hollow, nothing more than self-serving lies.
 He kept remembering the mother with her young babe clutched to her breast as she fled from him.
 When he had rammed her, she had tucked the child to guard it from the fall.
 Right before the kill, she had held him, trying to protect him.
 “Why?” he asked.

I pulled back in protest, but Alec's grasp on my hand tightened just enough to stop me.
 "She wanted you to wear them.
 They were meant to be worn again tonight."
 My head was still spinning as Alec offered me his arm and led me out of the room.
 There was a limo, easily the largest vehicle I'd ever seen, waiting for us outside.
 We piled into it with plenty of room to spare.
 The bar was fully stocked, but Alec shook his head at Rachel when she made as if to reach for a drink.
 Nobody else seemed even the slightest bit interested in the prospect of alcohol.
 Rachel sat back with a pout and then turned and whispered in my ear.
 "Stupid shape shifters.

I'd been anxiously waiting for him at his normal table when a pair of employees from the local florist had walked in, their arms overflowing with roses.
 I'd been expecting them to stop in front of Jasmin.
 Instead they'd passed her up and then declined to make a beeline to Cassie either.
 When they'd started handing the flowers to me, I'd tried to convince them there'd been some kind of mistake.
 The sound of 'One Day More' playing on the cell phone nestled in the closest bouquet had been what finally convinced me it was all meant for me.
 Brandon's voice had been like silk caressing my face when I'd answered the phone.
 One minute I was minding my own business trying to pretend like I didn't notice the nasty looks some of Brandon's friends were shooting my way when they thought I wasn't looking, the next I was going to the biggest dance of the year with the most popular guy in school.
 I'd half thought Cassie was going to rip out my throat.
 I walked past a pair of gorgeous, gold-fringed drapes, handed my ticket to a distinguished-looking man in a uniform, and then smiled as he pointed me towards my door.
 It was almost a relief to be around strangers again.

There is a rumor that she might be an actual direct descendent of a God, though no one knew who that God might be.” “Really?
 That is rare if true.
 What is your gut instinct about her?” Rodregas asked.
 “Well, I am not sure if I am just doing the girl power together thing, but while she would not talk to me, I kind of like her.” Rodregas nodded, he had a similar impression.
 “Thank you for looking into their backgrounds, Imeralda.
 You should go get some sleep; the joust should be going on for hours.” She nodded as he got in the saddle.
 But before he could ride out she asked, “I don’t suppose you want to explain why you wanted to know about them?” “I am not sure, just thinking about options,” he answered.
 Then he pulled Doom Hoof through a wide turn and tried to get him moving and warmed up.
 If the beast felt any excitement or nervousness he was not showing it.
 Which Rodregas admitted was better than the opposite reaction.

The true constraints are not material, but psychological and social.
 Recognizing the real barriers will help us overcome them.
 Human beings are our most creative, productive and precious resource.
 Human capacity increases the more it is drawn upon.
 It can never be exhausted.
 Developing the human resource should be the centrepiece of all development strategy.
 We can solve today’s most pressing problems if we adopt a total approach which takes into account all the interrelated factors – political, economic, technological, social and environmental – rather than relying on partial strategies.
 Partial remedies, however welcome or desirable, can always generate side-effects – such as the increase in social tensions and violence observed when increasing political and social freedom are not matched by increasing economic opportunity, or the rise in unemployment and arms exports that accompany a reduction in defence expenditure.
 The success of the Green Revolution was due to its integration of technological, institutional, commercial and public policy measures, while its short comings arose from its failure to integrate environmental factors, which are now being incorporated in agricultural development strategies.
 Comprehensive measures can eliminate the side-effects of partial progress.

Is our pride in danger?” Blodeuwedd nodded, “Yes and yes and yes.
 In their great quest for power, The Immortalist Taiga and his followers, such as that vermin Van’dret, must all be stopped.
 They do not understand that if they upset the balance that the final battle between Infernal and Celestial could destroy all.” She paused and then added in a voice that he almost thought he sensed fear in, “I think the sword Caledfwlch must be found.
 The other gods won’t like it.
 They might even oppose finding it, but it might be our only hope.” The great head nodded, and the Goddess stepped away and was gone, but the roar that followed could be heard across the grasslands and into the forest and to the peaks of the mountains beyond.
 For a moment the Heavenly Realm was silent.
 All the creatures knew the roar.
 The great Celestial Lion was on the hunt and when he found his prey, there would be a battle to shake all the realms.
 As the roar faded in the heavens, a new Knight Captain, a chosen Champion of a Goddess, stood in the great Cathedral of the Heavens.
 He heard the roar because it was his.

If I didn't, he would be justified in killing whichever two of my friends he wants."
 "So there's no way you can avoid fighting him?"
 Alec's smile was more bittersweet than normal.
 "No, but it's not too late to save you.
 I can have you on a flight to Paris tonight.
 It's the only way to guarantee your safety."
 I shook my head.
 "I'm not leaving.

 I wish you'd stop asking me to."

Restructuring the UN
 The movement towards democracy is not merely a question of idealism.
 In some countries, particularly in Africa, it is an essential step towards over coming the desperate economic conditions that threaten the lives of millions of people.
 In many others, it can vastly accelerate the development process by releasing greater social initiative.
 In his message to the ICPF quoted earlier, the UN Secretary General emphasized the importance of democratization – what he chose to call political development – as an essential foundation and complement to peace, and to both economic and social development.
 There have been cases where development was accompanied by an authoritarian political system.
 But, we have invariably seen that if the participation in the market place is not accompanied by political participation, development efforts are brought to naught by social and political instability.... Once again, therefore, we see the inescapable relations governing the goals of peace, development and democratization – these are the goals of the United Nations.
 In order for this revolution to have its full beneficial impact on the world’s political and economic affairs, its principles need to be extended to cover all nations and international institutions.
 The end of the confrontation between democratic and autocratic superpowers within the UN system opens up the possibility of finally translating the idealistic aims of the UN into practical realities.
 First and foremost is the prospect of extending representative government to all nations.

"This isn't over."
 I felt my knees almost collapse as the two packs slowly backed away from each other, and Jasmin joined me inside the classroom.
 Mrs. Campbell gave the two of us a considering look after reading Jasmin's note, but sent us off to a pair of empty seats at the back of the classroom without comment.
 We were starting a new unit, but I couldn't concentrate on the lecture.
 Alec's unshakable calm over the last few days had mostly convinced me the other members of his pack had been overreacting.
 Somehow I'd come to believe the coming dispute with Brandon's pack would be resolved as easily as a normal teenage dispute.
 After experiencing such intense, barely restrained violence, I was starting to see just how ludicrous that'd been.
 People had already died over what was going on here.
 It hadn't been real, either because I hadn't examined Simon and Nathanial's lifeless bodies, or maybe because I was repressing the experience like I'd done with so many other parts of my life lately.
 I could feel my mind trying to shut down, hoping to cushion me from the worst implications of what was coming.

 "I'm sorry, sweetheart—I never considered that living here with me might make you uncomfortable."
 "It doesn't.
 I feel as safe with you as I do in my own home.
 I just--it's just that no one else would understand."
 "Well, don't worry about Teri.
 I won't tell her, and she's going to love you."
 They went into the kitchen to fix breakfast.
 Marie glanced at Rick as he poured juice.

Rodregas knew that if Ravenhurr had ever thought he had more than basic magic training he would long have been reassigned to a duty far from the ceremony.
 The very air seemed to strum like a stringed instrument with the gathered magical power.
 Rodregas could not help but think about how out of his depth he was trying to interfere with the ritual ceremony.
 However, as he forced the beautiful woman forward, the woman whose name he had refused to learn, he knew he was indeed going to try.
 “I will do it this time,” Rodregas thought to himself, “This time I will not choose my survival over others.” His life was not worth living if he did nothing again; he wanted to feel at least a small measure of being the man he had been raised to be.
 “Celestial Gods, please let my life be worth something in death, if not in life,” he prayed quietly.
 Captain Poir and Rodregas carefully put the two prisoners in the middle of their circles, and then stepped out.
 They each picked up small wooden clubs.
 Dale and Junnit stood across from the two of them holding matching clubs.
 The ceremony required the prisoners to stay in each circle unbound.

Gene lives here now, he said it was easier to have a more centralized base of operation.
 Besides he said he wanted to spend more time with you.
 Build a relationship.
 Bring you into his plan.
 Liz – What does that mean?
 Centralized Base of Operations?
 Johnny – Yeah, he only lives a mile away from here.
 Jim – I just think its part of his master evil plan to piss you off.
 Seems that Gene has once again scored a point for the forces of darkness.
 I wonder if he’s working for the Canadians.

Individually Alec could take any of them.
 There's a reason he's dominant to all of the rest of them.
 James is a hybrid too.
 He isn't even second in the pack because Isaac is a better fighter than him, but he makes for a strong third.
 Jasmin is essentially fourth, although sometimes she gets away with bossing James and even Isaac around.
 Apparently she's a lot tougher than a normal wolf should be, and she's just crazy enough to fight to the death over something that the other two don't think is really all that important.
 Jessica is pretty much the most submissive, not by temperament, but because she's the weakest fighter we've got."
 I felt my eyes go wide at all the new terms, but kept my mouth shut because I was worried Rachel would clam up if I started asking questions.
 "I'm pretty sure Alec could take two of them, but not all three.
 They knew that, which was part of the reason they were pushing so hard."

"Won't you consider staying here with me?
 Marrying me?"
 Her throat tightened, and she pulled her chin free, shaking her head.
 "I can't."
 She gripped his hands.
 "It's like a lifeline.
 I love you, and I love 2011, but if I let go of my home, I'd be lost."
 Rick reached into his pocket, taking out his handkerchief and handing it to her.
 She started to wipe her face with it but then stopped.
 Rick frowned as she stared at it.

I wish I knew French and could read the original.
 But it has taken me decades to gain a meager command of Spanish.
 So I resort to an English dictionary, look up "adore" and all I find are synonyms: worship; revere, venerate; and one somewhat helpful description: deep, rapturous love.
 That one rings truest.
 According to my vocabulary, if we adore something, we are drawn to it and resist separation.
 Its presence comforts, inspires, provides us with hope and meaning.
 The thought of losing it may terrify or leave us in despair.
 I feel all that about my kids.
 I have felt somewhat the same about a few others, at least for a time.
 But I would be lying if I claimed to feel all that about God.

If there is blame, it falls on me.”
 The elf stared off into the forest, her brown eyes seeing nothing.
 Harruq and Qurrah’s relationship could not be clearer to her mind.
 Qurrah directed, Qurrah ordered, and then Harruq bore the guilt and the blame.
 Did Harruq ever consider disobedience?
 She didn’t know.
 “We done here?” the half-orc asked.
 He left without giving her a chance to answer.

As he came to rest the sound of arrows was quiet, part of his mind knew that Imeralda was backing deeper into the forest.
 As he cleared the mess he had made of the last slaver, Rodregas came face to face with an Immortal Guard.
 Behind him were two more slavers.
 The Immortal Guard wore the classic half plate of regulation Immortal Guard armor: A full suit of Mithril chain covered with a breastplate and leg guards and vambraces for the forearms.
 His head was covered with a half helm.
 His Mithril was shining in the sun.
 His breast plate was solid dark Night Bronze.
 The middle of his breastplate had the symbol of the Immortalists, an eagle soaring up into the clouds.
 In his left hand was the regulation one handed long sword of the guard.
 In his right he held a small round shield.

He stood and started toward me, about to speak again—just as the door swung open.
 Chevelle’s face flushed with anger.
 “Elfreda!” Steed was through the door and to me in three long strides.
 He grabbed me at the waist, picking me up and spinning me so that my cloak swirled behind.
 The shock and exuberance of his greeting was too much and I couldn’t help but let out a breathless laugh.
 He put me down but kept me close, his hands still at my waist.
 “Steed,” I said, very nearly winded.
 “What are you doing here?” He glanced at Chevelle, who was still plainly annoyed, and his carefree smile dissolved.
 “I was heading to Bray and ran across some trackers.” Chevelle’s eyes flicked to my face and then back to Steed.
 Steed dropped his hands from my waist as he winked at me.

His entire world had just come crashing down in the darkness.
 Above him were more than fifty elves, each one eager to bury an arrow in his back.
 “Harruq,” he said, crawling amid the bodies.
 He desperately hoped none would spot him.
 He reached a large stinking corpse lying on its back with a golden arrow in its forehead.
 Qurrah shoved the cadaver onto its side, curled underneath, and then let it fall atop him.
 The weight crushed his fragile body and the smell was awful, but it was his only cover.
 Miserable, he hid there, quietly whispering.
 “Where are you, Harruq?” he said, his face buried into the dirt.
 His tears fell to the grass.

 Greg: So I’ve seen every episode of all of the Star Trek series.
 Cindy: hello
 Greg: I still have no idea what’s going on.
 Cindy:  oh it’s absolutely beautiful.
 Greg:  But I figure, if you can’t beat them, join them.

I interrupted him, unable to stop myself.
 “My mother died.” I had no idea why I was speaking.
 I batted my eyes and tried to shake it off, concentrating on Steed again.
 He seemed to notice I was back and continued his story.
 I leaned my head on his chest, snuggling into his warmth.
 My face felt numb.
 Somewhere in the distance, the door opened and the vibration in Steed’s chest quieted as his words cut off.
 My head turned dazedly toward the door, keeping it steady against Steed.
 Chevelle’s furious gaze flicked to my cloak piled on the floor before returning to us.
 Us.

Jim – Yep.
 He spent almost one entire issue stuffed inside a mail-box.
 Johnny – What for?
 Jim – To catch the Evil Mad Mail Bomber Vixen.
 She was sending letter bombs to people and it was Sumo’s quest to catch her.
 Johnny – Who gave him that quest?
 Jim – Nobody gave him the quest he learned about it from watching the nightly news.
 He was just really bored that weekend, so off he went.
 Johnny – That’s just retarded.
 Jim – If you think that’s bad just read the issue where both Sumo and Skinny died, and then were resurrected by the Schizophrenic Bi-polar Doctor as zombies.

We still didn't have a phone, and probably wouldn't for weeks to come, even assuming we somehow managed to keep our home through the end of the week.
 Calling Mom and asking her to come and get me was out.
 Presumably if I waited long enough Mom would decide something was wrong and come looking for me.
 Unless she was out hiking somewhere, in which case it might be a day or two before she realized I was missing.
 There was nothing to do but walk.
 I waited a few minutes to give Britney time to get out of the lab, and then walked in and grabbed my things.
 The other kids were already clearing out.
 Nobody even looked up as I left.
 Luckily I'd worn sneakers rather than the exotic footwear most girls gravitated towards.
 If I'd been wearing anything else, I'd have been nursing blisters before I made it out of the parking lot.

Looks like I wasn’t sleeping after all.
 Chapter 3
 Sneaking out after hours isn’t easy, especially at Emily’s house.
 Her parents aren’t sound sleepers.
 If we weren’t really careful, they’d wake up and then we’d have some answering to do.
 And I don’t think they’d understand our reason.
 I followed Emily down the stairs, in our pajamas, to the door.
 We were careful not to make a sound but I listened closely to the sound of her dad snoring.
 When the snore rang clearly through the house, I breathed a sigh of relief.
 We threw on our sneakers and snuck out the door.

He stood to walk from the room and I stared at the stone entry, struggling to keep my thoughts from spinning out of control.
 Too much had happened.
 Too much was wrong.
 My life had flipped, twisted into some strange reflection of itself, and I couldn’t reconcile the fragments.
 It caused me physical pain to think about Chevelle’s touch, about council, about what was happening, and I knew it was the bonds.
 When Grey walked out, my trance broke and I noticed Ruby by the front window, wearing an odd smile.
 I flushed and turned from her, rolling into a ball on my blankets, remembering no more than the feel of his skin on my neck, the quirk of his lips.
 I had to keep distracted, and there was nothing for it but the book.
 I wasn’t able to find much regarding humans in the study’s library.
 But I had been right.

Economic measures must be supported internationally to provide attractive commercial alternatives to drug growers through special trade agreements for agricultural commodities.
 International criminal proceedings should be instituted against violators under a new International Criminal Code.
 12.The UN should create its own international surveillance system, including its own satellites, to monitor and report on potential trouble spots and troop movements.
 It should also develop its own appropriate and effective logistics units.
 Criteria to allow UN fact-finding missions in respect of intra-state conflict should be negotiated and codified by the General Assembly.
 At the same time, the UN should integrate fact-finding into enforcement action taken under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.
 A UN Staff College should be established to develop and maintain administrative procedures for governing UN peace-keeping, peace-making and peace-enforcing operations and to train an effective corps of personnel for these purposes.
 Utilization of Defence Resources for Development and the Environment
 1.The concept of 'peace dividend' should be expanded to include manpower, educational and training capabilities, scientific and technological resources, production facilities, land and abandoned military bases that can be redeployed to combat rural and urban poverty as well as national and global environmental degradation.
 An inventory of these resources should be compiled and efforts made to identify alternative uses through the UN's specialized agencies and by national governments.

Surely they would be less frightening in the light of day.
 Ruby broke the tense atmosphere with a curtsey.
 “And Ruby Summit.” I attempted a smile for her, not missing the silent exchange between Steed and Chevelle.
 They were trying to decide what to do with me.
 “Since you’re apparently not ready to retire for the evening, I suppose we will resume your training,” Chevelle said.
 I sighed.
 “Ooh, let me!” Ruby shouted.
 Chevelle gave her a doubtful look and then glanced at me, apparently deciding I deserved it.
 He nodded once and walked toward the rock ledge.
 Ruby bounced from foot to foot, celebrating her victory.

Faster and faster Dieredon swung, whirling his blades against where he perceived the wall to be.
 Power rippled in the air, black and deadly.
 As the elf fought against the shadow wall Velixar began another spell.
 Words of magic flew off his tongue in perfect pitch and pronunciation in spite of their incredible difficulty.
 A strong thrust from Dieredon finally shattered the invisible barrier but the explosion of power sent him flying backward.
 He rolled when he hit the ground, his legs tucked, and then with a kick he vaulted himself into the air.
 He landed on his feet and lunged at the necromancer, the blades of his bow leading.
 “Be gone!” Velixar roared, the sound of a daemon unleashed.
 Dieredon fought, but it felt as if a thousand hands pulled him back.
 Pain spiked within his chest, and a sick sound filled his head as two of his ribs broke.

They were not in time to stop Imeralda from entering through the hidden door.
 Rodregas could feel Imeralda in front of him, but she and the doors seemed to disappear.
 His eyes seemed of no use so he closed them and simply walked toward where he knew she was.
 He felt Doi’van grab onto his shoulder and follow him.
 When he opened his eyes, he saw that they had entered another great chamber.
 At first he thought it was the same size as the first chamber until his eyes saw the huge tree in the middle and followed it up and then up.
 The tree soared above them so high that Rodregas thought it must be far higher than the Cathedral itself.
 This was, of course, impossible.
 As Rodregas stopped beside Imeralda he tried to see the shape of the leaf to identify the type of tree, but the leaves were so high up he could only see a very general shape.
 The shape of the trunk reminded him of a white oak, but the color was a darker gray with touches of striped brown.

"Fractions, huh?"
 "Yeah, I'm supposed to reduce them after I finish adding, but I can't seem to get to the same answer as the book on this one."
 She'd transposed a couple of the numbers when working on one of the intermediate steps.
 "Here it is, you've changed the numbers here, it should be fourteen sixty-fifths, not fourteen fifty-sixths."
 Rachel's skin was several shades darker than mine, tan enough that it didn't show embarrassment as easily, but it still looked like she'd gone the slightest bit red.
 "Oh, I'm sorry to bug you with such a stupid mistake."
 "Don't worry about it.
 I'm just glad it was that easy.
 I've been worried all day someone would stump me on something right out of the gate on my first day."
 Rachel looked up at me through dark lashes as I stood.

“I shall do as you command,” Ahrqur said in a lifeless voice.
 “Of course,” Velixar said.
 “There is no other way.”
 Ahrqur glanced to Qurrah, and his mouth opened to speak.
 Both Tun brothers felt a bit of panic, wondering what their new master might say if he learned what they had done.
 Instead, he closed his mouth and glared at Velixar one last time before running north on legs that would never tire.
 “When will you know of his success or failure?” Qurrah asked once his eyes could no longer perceive the elf’s faint outline.
 “Immediately,” Velixar whispered.
 “All he sees, I see.
 All he hears, I hear.

But what did Kojas do?
 He whipped out his sword and slashed the arrow in half right before it hit him.
 The pieces fell on the ground.
 Holy tamale.
 I stared at the cracked pieces of my arrow and my flare of determination went out with a poof.
 Great, now what do I do?
 That was a fail, I scolded myself.
 A FAIL!
 “Nice try,” Seth whispered and I think he really meant it.
 Or maybe he was teasing me.

"Wait, you could see me smile?
 I guess that all follows, better hearing, better sense of smell.
 Of course you'd have better vision too."
 It wasn't until I heard the note of longing in my voice that I realized what I was missing.
 Alec didn't have that same advantage, and I could feel him waiting expectantly.
 "Sorry, it's just that this all makes me think of these amazing dreams I've been having since I arrived.
 I'm transported to various places, but in every case I can hear and smell better than I can in real life.
 Not only that, everything is glowing.
 Only that isn't the right word for it.
 Mostly there's just light coming out of the people and the plants and animals.

The four of you were chosen because of your unbreakable bond, but even that can be broken.
 You are strongest when you are together, but don’t let yourselves be separated.
 Kojas had separated us because he already knew that.
 The girl had warned us for a reason.
 She had known that Kojas was going to try to split us up into groups so that we would be weak.
 I watched Seth pace back and forth, nervously running his fingers through his hair and drumming the hilt of his sword.
 I can also tell you to be careful about Kojas; he's tricky and will use your emotions against you.
 He'll find a way to get you to come to him instead of him coming to you.
 The girl had told us more than we had thought.
 Maybe Kojas thought we would both imagine that he did something to the other two so that we would come running to him.

Tiny Netherlands, with the highest population density in the world, produces more than sufficient food to feed itself and remain a large net food exporter.
 Currently 11 per cent of the world’s land surface is used for agricultural crops, just 4 per cent more than in 1960.
 A comprehensive theoretical study of soils, climate, vegetation and topography conducted in 1975 indicated that both land and water utilized for agriculture could be doubled, if necessary, and that the earth could support 36 times the 1975 level (18 times the 1990 level) of cereal production using the same share of cultivated land.
 There would be severe practical obstacles to such a vast expansion of croplands, but these findings suggest that physical limitations to food production are not the primary constraints.
 A more commonly accepted estimate indicates that the world’s land and water used for agriculture could more than double.
 Agriculture’s Dual Role
 Achieving food security necessitates increasing food production and employment opportunities.
 Agriculture plays a dual role in the abolition of hunger – it produces the food and it can also produce a great many of the jobs needed by households to buy food in developing countries.
 Since agriculture is the world’s single largest employer, raising production and productivity in this sector can immediately place additional purchasing power in the hands of the rural poor, who will in turn utilize the additional income for purchasing more food, clothing and other basic consumer goods that will create more jobs and higher incomes for countless others.
 The increased agricultural produce becomes raw material for a wide range of agro-based industries and services that stimulate formation of new enterprises, and create downstream jobs as well as products for further processing, domestic sale or export.

Beside him, Qurrah Tun stood mesmerized by the sight.
 Hundreds of skulls bathed in purple fire sailed over the walls of Veldaren like dark comets.
 Gaping mouths shrieked mindless wails, their voices bone-chilling and unrelenting.
 A few soldiers fired arrows, but most hid behind their shields.
 “Why do you cower?” Qurrah asked, striking his brother on the shoulder.
 “The skulls are nuisances, nothing more.”
 “Sorry,” Harruq muttered.
 He shivered as a skull sailed just above them, its screech turning to chaotic laughter.
 The sound raced up and down his spine, triggering fear no matter how irrational.
 Qurrah watched as if immune to the sound.

He-he doesn’t—“  She swallowed, her face turning red as she thought, his kisses don’t make me hot like yours do.
 He caressed her cheek.
 “Maybe it’s something you should think about.”  He ran his thumb over her lower lip.
 “You deserve better, Marie.”  He tilted her chin up, touching his lips to hers.
 When she didn't pull away, he repeated the feather-light touch.
 He felt her breath, the quivering of her lips.
 He kissed the corner of her mouth and nuzzled her cheek.
 Gathering her closer, he began taking her lips in one soft kiss after another.
 But as her response grew warmer, his kisses became hungrier.
 Marie was growing hot and felt almost drugged by Rick's kisses.

I whisper in one call as if I can’t talk because I am still stuck at home with my wife and cannot talk freely.
 I reassure Ashley that I will meet her as soon as I can get out.
 I think of my wife and son at home wondering why I haven’t called; is it over?
 Am I dead?
 Finally the crew is all present behind the store, and the review of protocol and procedure began as it did before.
 New officers are in amongst familiar faces from the prior attempt.
 I find myself less interested in their chat as I mentally prepare myself for the task at hand.
 I am given the weapons and shots fired instructions again.
 In my usual humorous deflection of discomfort, I quip that the last time I met Ashley it was a “happy ending” and I would like the same result this time.
 The officers are un-amused.

We walked in comfortable silence for several minutes before turning off into what I could only assume was the Lilac Room.
 Donovan looked up as we entered the suite.
 "I trust your mother was well, sir?"
 Alec nodded, a short choppy motion that eloquently conveyed his desire not to discuss the matter.
 He turned towards me, only to break off as a cell phone rang.
 "It's for you, probably your mom.
 Pretend you're home, I'll explain once you're finished."
 I almost dropped the phone, and probably wouldn't have managed to figure out how to answer the call in time if he hadn't reached over and pushed the green button for me.
 "Hello?"
 "Adri, honey, are you sure this is a good idea?

I was in my room when she arrived.
 I heard the two quick raps and then one loud knock from her visits during my childhood and instantly knew it was her.
 “Aunt Junnie!” I gushed as she came in.
 She wore a simple hooded cloak, seemingly unafraid as she passed the guards at my door.
 She walked as though she ruled the castle, not as if she were a light elf in the center of a dark lord’s rule.
 She confessed to me a secret her family held, a power I had not known from my mother.
 They had kept it from my father, though he had stolen her after hearing a rumor of it.
 She passed to me many details of her sister, of the family… my family.
 She’d risked so much by coming here, to help me, to help my child.
 I would owe her.

Antonil’s sword looped around, thrust forward, and buried deep inside flesh.
 The elf fell, gasping for air from the fatal wound.
 Blood pooled below him.
 Antonil pulled his sword free and saluted him with the blade.
 “Well fought,” he said.
 An arrow clanged against his sword and ricocheted off.
 “A warning for your honor,” said a camouflaged elf as he stepped out from behind a door.
 A second arrow followed the first, thudding against Antonil’s shield.
 “A second out of respect.” He drew a third.
 The guard captain charged, his shield leading.

Jim – That’s for sure.
 I thought I was bad at games, but Gene, ten dollars in twenty minutes is just terrible.
 I wonder if that include all the time he had to wait for a turn to play the game.
 Liz – Knowing Gene, he really blew twenty dollars in ten minutes, but not by playing video games.
 Jim – What do you think he spent it on candy?
 Liz – Have you seen how much candy that boy eats?
 Jim – Yeah, but twenty dollars of candy is a lot of candy.
 I mean damn.
 If he could actually eat that much candy that fast shouldn’t he be like 400 pounds by now?
 Liz – Maybe he switched to some expensive imported brand of German chocolate.

CM: 	Can you tell me a bit about them, those other songs?
 BG:  	Sure.
 CM: 	Who all recorded stuff by you?
 It’s been a matter of some speculation for years—that you wrote a lot of stuff using pseudonyms—that we’ll never really know how much of your stuff is out there.
 BG:  	There was a period—an era, really—where I was bleeding songs, where they were just flowing out of me.
 There was too much stuff for Black Lung.
 And some of it didn’t fit the power trio thing, you know?
 Some of it was purposely for others, friends, fellow seekers.
 I can’t even tell you all of them—partly because I don’t remember and partly because, I think, there are legal complications.
 CM:  	What were some of those pseudonyms?

I was a man hit in the heart with a sledgehammer.
 She just reached out and took my hand.
 It was that simple, that profound.
 She was looking right into me, like I was a sideshow mirror, and maybe I was, man.
 Distorting images, throwing off suncats.
 She saw it all, clear as crystal.
 We went to her place that afternoon.
 She had this Midtown apartment—I don’t know if I can do it justice.
 It was the most filled room I’d ever seen.
 Clutter, but, taken as a whole, it all made sense.

We roamed alleys and climbed hills no doubt mistaking mathematicians, who commuted daily to San Jose, for poets or novelists.
 Everybody who looked at home, we imagined had flopped in the Beat boarding houses Kerouac immortalized, or at least listened to the man speak his words in the Cellar, accompanied by a jazz riffing tenor sax.
 We overdosed on espresso.
 Then, as we climbed a hill to recover, I recited a jumble of lines I remembered from Ginsberg's Howl: "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix, wandered around and around at midnight in the railway yard wondering where to go, and loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking visionary Indian angels, and lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup, a hopeless task, and so took ship and disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving nothing behind but the shadow of dungarees and the larva and ash of poetry..." And I recited from On the Road about the children crying in Iowa where they let the children cry and where "the evening star must be drooping and spreading her sparkler dims on the prairie, which is just before the coming of complete night that blesses the earth, darkens the all rivers, cups the peaks and folds the final shore in."
 We explored every street and alley of North Beach and drifted into Chinatown, where I imagined us meeting two exquisite immigrant girls.
 I told Eric these beauties would plead for us to steal them away from the rich devil who had enslaved and brought them from China.
 We would conspire to snatch a suitcase full of cash from the rich devil.
 Then we would speed off toward the forests of Idaho to live in dissolute passion for a while.
 As always when my mind spilled over, Eric stood by me, often wearing a smile that hinted of love.
 Back in North Beach after midnight, a couple of Finochio’s transvestite dancers waylaid us.

"Where would you like to go now?"
 her mother asked her when they'd finished their lunch.
 "Home."
 "Home?
 We've only been to two shops."
 "I'm a little tired.
 I'd just like to go home."
 She felt a little anxious as she walked into her house.
 She wanted Rick to hold her, to caress her hair and kiss her temple and whisper that he loved her.
 But she'd never have that again.

Sunglasses, or maybe a blindfold.
 "I'm fine.
 That wasn't anything; it didn't mean anything.
 Please put me down."
 I tried to put the right amounts of sincerity and confidence in my words, but I wasn't a very good liar.
 Something changed though because Alec slowed his ground-eating stride.
 "What do you mean you're fine?
 People don't just collapse with no warning.
 You seemed fine and then you were falling.
 You s...you seemed hurt."

My efforts to focus were entirely wasted.
 It took everything I had just to hold myself together until class ended.
 I'd planned on remaining in my seat until everyone else left, but Mrs. Tiggs motioned me to her desk while half the class was still filing out the door.
 "It gives me no pleasure to tell you this, but based on your initial test score I think you should prepare yourself for the fact that you're probably going to fail this class.
 I worried this would be the result of your starting so late in the semester and not having any prior Spanish experience.
 Unfortunately, it's now too late for you to switch into another class.
 I'm afraid you'll just have to take the failing grade."
 I stood there woodenly for several seconds, unsure whether or not she was through.
 She finally made a shooing motion and turned back to grading papers.
 Predictably, there were still a half-dozen other kids in the classroom.

This timely report should help to promote the idea of human-centred development within a culture of peace as a way forward to a better world.
 We are gratified that ICPF should have assigned UNESCO, as the intellectual arm of the United Nations, a prominent role in its recommended agenda for action, and we reaffirm our commit ment to working with all possible partners in pursuit of the goal of global peace and sustainable human development.
 Federico Mayor Director General UNESCO
 The International Commission on Peace and Food began its work at a time of uncommon opportunities for rapid transition on a global scale to democratic ways of life, freedom of the media, and an independent judiciary; food, literacy, health and jobs for all; and sustainable life styles based on harmony between humankind and nature.
 The end of the Cold War and the consequent shift of expenditure from defence to development, the onset of the Information Age and the organization of information superhighways, the growth of mechanisms for regional cooperation, a renewed faith in the United Nations, and commitment to multilateral negotiations and action all provided new opportunities for achieving global peace and prosperity.
 Rapid progress in the application of science and technology in agriculture, industry, and human health strengthened the hope that the concept of 'food, education, health and employment for all' can be converted from rhetoric into reality, provided the peace dividend can be deployed to achieve these goals.
 ICPF had the advantage of building on the work of earlier independent commissions, particularly those chaired by Willy Brandt, Gro Harlem Brundtland and Julius Nyerere.
 We began our work with the conviction that, as Willy Brandt said, 'the problems created by men can be solved by men'.
 The ancient Indian scripture, Bhagavad Gita, expressed the same sentiment by stressing, 'Whatever man aspires to, that he can accomplish.'
 The achievement of food self-sufficiency by India in a period when famine threatened millions of lives through the power of political will and scientific action in a democratic society illustrates this truth.

 He put the bowl in the oven and set it for one minute.
 "Do you have electricity?"
 "My father had our house wired a few months ago."
 "Do you have a television?"
 "A what?"
 "How about a radio?"
 "Yes.
 And electric lights."
 She jumped when the microwave beeped.

 Qurrah broke away from his brother when the last died before them.
 He could smell the fear of the villagers, and like a tracking dog he could use it to find where they fled.
 Flames danced across the side of one house, alerting Qurrah.

 well, at least she'd be back home.
 That thought filled her with an astonishing sadness.
 Sadness, not just disappointment over Hollywood—-because she'd miss Rick.
 "Afraid of what?"
 Rick stroked her cheek with his thumb.
 "Hmmm?
 Oh.
 Nothing."

But he understood his own power, which in its way was as great as any god’s.
 He growled, “Do you wish me to hunt, to fight?
 Is our pride in danger?” Blodeuwedd nodded, “Yes and yes and yes.
 In their great quest for power, The Immortalist Taiga and his followers, such as that vermin Van’dret, must all be stopped.
 They do not understand that if they upset the balance that the final battle between Infernal and Celestial could destroy all.” She paused and then added in a voice that he almost thought he sensed fear in, “I think the sword Caledfwlch must be found.
 The other gods won’t like it.
 They might even oppose finding it, but it might be our only hope.” The great head nodded, and the Goddess stepped away and was gone, but the roar that followed could be heard across the grasslands and into the forest and to the peaks of the mountains beyond.
 For a moment the Heavenly Realm was silent.
 All the creatures knew the roar.
 The great Celestial Lion was on the hunt and when he found his prey, there would be a battle to shake all the realms.

I jerked back in response, but a screeching siren pierced my ears and I doubled over, covering them.
 It was inside, a screaming, terrible howl coming from my ears.
 I tried to force my eyes open, hoping someone would help me, but they were just standing there, chest to chest, arguing.
 Did they not see me?
 I ached to scream for help, but couldn’t get a sound out, couldn’t breathe.
 They leaned toward each other, oblivious to anything else.
 My eyes closed as I curled into a ball.
 The seconds dragged on and I began to wonder if I would die.
 And then it stopped.
 I sucked in a ragged breath, then another.

“Feels like the dark god himself is coming for us.
 Part of me wants to grab my children and run.”
 “Perhaps it is a warning,” Jeremiah said.
 “Ashhur may be granting us a chance.
 Bandits, or worse.
 The orcs have struck Veldaren once.
 They may well have found a way across the bone ditch again.”
 “Hard to rest with torchlight flickering into your bedroom,” said an elderly man behind Jeremiah.
 “Something ain’t right, Corren,” Jeremiah said, “and I’d bet all my harvest you feel it stronger than we do.”
 Corren stroked his beard as his eyes went blank.

Shouldn’t have let him ask questions.
 The last of his adrenaline faded as images of the child’s quivering lips and trembling hands haunted his vision.
 “Half,” Harruq whispered as he wiped blood from his swords onto the grass.
 “Only half.”
 The kill had been quick, just a single cut through the shoulder blade, the heart, and then the lung.
 No suffering, little pain.
 It was all he could offer.
 “He’s dead, Qurrah,” the half-orc shouted.
 His deep voice, like a bear’s growl, seemed right at home in the forest.
 “Come on over.”

I had to break it, even if it meant further examining all of the holes inside me that I'd spent so many months struggling to ignore.
 "So you're just one of those guys that can't resist trying to help the broken girls, huh?"
 "No.
 That's Dominic's theory, I didn't say it was mine.
 I did what I did because when I close my eyes I still see you there."
 My heart jumped up to my throat, but in a good way.
 "I don't know why, not really.
 Your incredible, unearthly beauty helps, as does your stubborn determination to continue soldiering on, despite how badly you've been hurt.
 That doesn't explain it all though.
 Neither does the fact that you stepped in and saved Rachel from a beating I couldn't stop."

Our work has been largely supported by grants from UNDP and UNESCO.
 UNESCO also provided the services of Dr Maurice Goldsmith, Director, International Science Policy Foundation, to edit this report.
 It has been a privilege working with Dr Goldsmith, an editor of extraordinary wit and wisdom.
 I am indebted to Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary General of the United Nations; Dr Federico Mayor, Director General of UNESCO; and Mr James Gustave Speth, Administrator of UNDP, for their support and encouragement.
 A special word of thanks is also due to Mrs Robin La Brie-Jackson, who has helped throughout in managing the work of the Commission with great competence and courtesy.
 Finally, I must acknowledge the inspiration and encouragement provided by Mr T. Natarajan, Secretary, The Mother's Service Society, Pondicherry, India, from the very inception of the idea of the Commission.
 His emphasis on leadership in thought that leads to action has served as a guiding principle for the work of the Commission.
 A more complete list of the many individuals and institutions who have contributed generously of their time and resources to our work is contained in the Acknowledgements appended to this volume.
 During 1994 and 1995, several major international events will take place.
 The International Conference on Population and Development at Cairo in September 1994, the World Summit for Social Development at Copenhagen and the Fourth World Conference on Women at Beijing in 1995, and the designation of 1995 as the International Year for Tolerance all provide unique opportunities for promoting sustainable and equitable development.

It seals off the two worlds and if a monster were to make it as far as the Half-way, it would have a truly difficult time completing its journey because it won’t find a way in or out of this place.” “So let me get this straight,” I said slowly, “we’re not in Igneeria right now but some Half-way?” The dwarf nodded, happily.
 “So where’s Igneeria?” The dwarf rubbed his stubby chin.
 “The entrance changes but its current location is in your town.
 That’s how I got here.
 But don’t get the Half-way confused with Igneeria, miss, for they are quite different.
 Especially now, with all the dark events that have been occurring because of his rising.” “You mean Kojas?” I asked.
 “Shh!
 Not here, not anywhere!” he said quickly.
 “Never say his name unless you’re sure he’s not around.
 His name can summon him or others.

There was no sign of Chevelle or his horse in the dim stone hollow.
 I sat up, rubbing my sore legs, unable to believe he’d left me.
 And then the rock wall struck me in the face.
 I cursed, my voice hoarse from sleep.
 The wall came at me again.
 “Okay, okay,” I shouted.
 “Let me up.” Chevelle’s camouflage dissipated and he stared down at me, disappointed.
 I smirked.
 “Where’s your horse?” He smiled as the beast nipped at the back of my head, yanking my hair.
 Grumbling, I swatted the horse away and ran my hand over my face, sure it was mottled with bruises and scratch marks.

But Emily wasn’t here.
 I could take it out with a few arrows but it’s best to kill Thrashers before they realize you’re there.
 Instead I lowered my bow and slowly crept up to it, until I could see the hideous claws on its hands and the hatred in its eyes.
 Thrashers hate everything and sometimes I wonder how they tolerate each other.
 I aimed for the head again and released the arrow.
 It whizzed silently into the thrasher and it howled in pain as the arrow dug into its fur.
 It whirled around, facing me.
 A low growl sounded in its throat and it charged.
 I ducked as it slashed my side and I winced.
 My shirt slowly turned blue from the trickling wound.

I stopped by Britney's desk to ask if she needed any help, and had to avoid an attempt to suck me into another gripe session about Mrs. Campbell.
 Satisfied that there wasn't anything I needed to be doing to help either of the other girls, and that they'd let me know if that changed, I broke out my Spanish book and reviewed some more vocabulary.
 Despite my growing hatred for Mrs. Tiggs, I managed to get deep enough into my Spanish homework to lose track of time.
 When I finally surfaced from abeja, camisa, and reloj it was just five minutes before I was supposed to close up for the afternoon.
 Rachel pulled her things together and left while I was straightening up the chairs.
 It was petty, but I waited inside the room until the clock showed exactly the time the lab was supposed to finish, and then joined Britney outside in the oppressive heat.
 The air was so dry I could nearly feel it pulling the moisture out of my body as we started around the school towards where Britney had parked her car.
 As we reached the west side of the building, the high-pitched growl of a performance engine tore a hole in the relative silence.
 The edge of the student parking lot was just barely in view now, but it was enough to see the source of the noise.
 A tiny figure barely recognizable as Rachel, was walking towards a dark-blue bullet bike, which had just roared to life.

He hugged her, his forehead pressed against hers.
 “Help me up,” she said.
 Harruq did as commanded.
 When she was standing, he grabbed his blades and sheathed them.
 She leaned all her weight against him, and such close contact only deepened his guilt and anger.
 He knew she watched him, and he wiped away his tears as quickly and subtly as he could.
 “Why, Harruq?” she asked him.
 The half-orc shrugged.
 “We…‌Qurrah…‌I don’t know.”
 “No,” she said, leaning on her staff.

The frailer brother approached the end of the alley where the sound of combat was strongest.
 His steps faltered only once.
 When Harruq moved to catch him, Qurrah glared and leaned against the side of a house.
 When a luckless orc rushed too close to the exit, Qurrah hurled the orb.
 Its explosion conjured shadows and shifting mists of violets and purples.
 The orc collapsed, white smoke rising softly from his tongue.
 In the sudden blinding light, Qurrah laughed.
 “Never,” he said, “could I have imagined it so beautiful.”

Although conditions vary from country to country, the crisis impacts most heavily on the unskilled, young people, urban poor, ethnic minorities and older workers.
 Specific programmes to effect structural changes will have to be introduced in order to ensure a fair opportunity to all, especially minority youth, to lead economically active lives.
 It is in this context that the European Union, the United States and other Western governments have been considering ambitious proposals for addressing this issue.
 The Australian government has unveiled a $4.6 billion jobs package to reduce unemployment from 10 per cent to 5 per cent by the end of the decade by encouraging training for the young, the unskilled and the long-term unemployed.
 Recently the OECD has presented the main planks of an employment strategy to stimulate economic growth in the industrial nations, make labour markets more flexible, increase productivity, and revamp employment and unemployment security provisions.
 The relative success of the US economy in creating jobs during the past decade has prompted other countries to emphasize the importance of policies to increase the flexibility of wage rates and bring down the price of labour by reductions in the statutory minimum wage.
 The main effect of this policy is likely to be a movement of jobs between nations, however, not a significant increase in the total number of jobs available.
 In fact, measures which reduce wage incomes could have the perverse effect of reducing aggregate purchasing power and employment.
 Economic growth is recognized as an essential, though not sufficient, condition for higher rates of job growth – but fears of inflation constrain industrial countries from trying to stimulate faster expansion of their economies.
 The primary impact of moderate levels of inflation would be to encourage an outflow of investment to more stable currencies.

He was unarmed; unarmored and needed to get as far away from Raven Keep as he could before someone noticed that he was not a sorcerer.
 He had spent too much time on the road without money, and he was not going to repeat the experience if he could help it.
 He needed money.
 Money would buy him what he needed to start his new life.
 Unfortunately, Ravenhurr had not been interested in material wealth, and what money he did have, he tended to spend on materials needed for his magical ceremonies; still there should be something that he could use.
 The bedroom was not large but this floor also held Ravenhurr’s study and a water closet.
 The far wall held a four-poster bed covered by a richly colored duvet.
 To the left of the bed was the door to the water closet and to the left of that a wardrobe.
 Along the connecting wall the fireplace calmly burned.
 To the right of the fireplace was a dresser with a small mirror and at the foot of the bed was an ornamental trunk that matched the wardrobe.

Jim - We can always hope though.
 It’d be the easiest way to solve the problem.
 Johnny – How so?
 By not doing anything?
 Jim – We could get a voodoo doll of him and poke it with pins.
 Johnny – That won’t work.
 Liz – How do you know?
 Johnny – I tried it already.
 Jim - Who on?
 Johnny – Who do you think?

He had to let them out, but how was he going to do that?
 If he simply opened the door, they might tear him apart.
 Rodregas thought the cats may also attack the guard at the front gate on their way out.
 He looked around and realized that the other side of the hall had a door that opened in the same direction as the door leading to the cage.
 He opened it up and thought that if he opened the Dire Cats’ door, he could block them from this direction, while keeping himself safe behind the two doors.
 He knew the guards at the gate would be incredibly curious about what he had been doing, but they would not actually do anything to challenge the man they thought was the Sorcerer Ravenhurr.
 He also knew that he would have to get them out of the way of the Dire Cats.
 At least that way he could also claim the black yew recurve bows.
 Rodregas walked back up the stairs and he thought that it would be a good idea to feed the beasts first, but he did not have time to grab a couple of chickens in the coop next to the kitchen.
 The sooner he was away from the keep the better.

Ruby offered Chevelle a drink and he sat in a chair beside mine.
 She prattled as she enjoyed the wine, and I tried to focus on her stories instead of the occasional glances he threw my way.
 And then he grabbed my arm.
 I flinched, afraid at the quickness and strength of the move, but he only trailed an index finger gently down my arm, over the design, to stop in the center of my palm.
 My arm relaxed into his grip.
 “You like it?
 Ruby did it.
 It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” His finger stayed on my palm as he looked up at me.
 His eyes lingered on my mouth for a moment and then met mine, piercing.
 “A hawk?” It seemed like an accusation, but I had no idea why.

He scowled at the cigar between his fingers, pained as always by the thought of his son.
 John had refused to let his father groom him for his company and had instead started a rival company.
 There was no real rivalry--John's company was too small and had too little capital--but the betrayal still hurt Jefferson deeply.
 "My only son turned his back on me," he continued, "leaving me in need of an heir.
 You have the stuff it takes to run a business, Davis.
 And I believe in keeping the business in the family, so when I made you vice president, it was with the assumption that I'd be grooming a son-in-law as well as the future president of the company."
 He rose, extending his hand.
 "You most certainly have my blessing, my boy.
 I'll give you my daughter's hand in marriage as soon as she and her mother can make all the arrangements--although that may take a bit longer than you might imagine, I'm afraid."
 "Thank you, sir--thank you very much."

“It suits you.” It was a familiar gesture and it should have made me flinch.
 Maybe it was the wine, but as I looked at him, my anger was fading.
 The way he’d reacted when Fannie had struck me, the caress against my cheek, those were not the actions of a council elder.
 As we sat so near, it was hard to believe the concern wasn’t real.
 His eyes burned with intensity; they seemed even darker now.
 Dark… like mine.
 I looked away.
 Steed broke in through the trees, gesturing toward the direction he’d come from.
 “They aren’t far.
 Ready and able for a morning adventure.” As he approached, he glanced at me and then Chevelle, still close beside me.

she said, laughing with happiness and relief.
 "I've never before lost you for five weeks and three days."
 She turned to put her arms around him.
 "I love you, Father."
 "I love you too, darling.
 Where have you been?"
 Marie caught her breath.
 In her misery over leaving Rick, she hadn't gotten around to thinking up a plausible story.
 "I-I'd rather not talk about it."
 "Not talk about it?"

The eyes of the nobleman grew wider, and panic gripped him entirely.
 “No, no you can’t.
 You wouldn’t!
 Please, I beg of you, don’t…”
 “Enough,” Qurrah said.
 His hand reached out, the tips of his fingers brushing the sides of the man’s face.
 Haunting words of magic flowed from the necromancer’s mouth.
 The noble’s jaw dropped, and black veins appeared in his eyes.
 “By the gods, what is that?”
 Harruq followed the man’s upward gaze but saw only clear night sky.

“We will not have to fall back so far,” Felewen disagreed.
 “They have scattered about our town.
 Their numbers mean nothing now.
 Besides,” she grinned, “we have Aurelia Thyne.”
 Both bowed politely.
 “Never could we have used a mage’s power more than now,” one said.
 Aurelia blushed and waved him off.
 “Please we must…”
 A cold chill spread through her body, like water from an underground stream meeting a creek.
 She whirled and stared down the street.

Following ICPF's third plenary meeting in Madras in October 1991, ICPF's Prosperity 2000 plan for creating 100 million jobs in India was presented to the Indian government, which incorporated the strategy in its Eighth Five Year Plan.
 The findings of that study and the strategic recommendations that emerged from it convinced us that eradicating the spectres of hunger, unemployment and poverty was possible even though these problems are present on such a massive scale in many developing countries.
 Events continued to accelerate with the break-up of the USSR later that year, followed by the collapse of the Eastern European economies in 1992.
 Simultaneously, the slowdown in trade within this region and the high cost of Germany's reunification were having an unexpected and unwelcome impact on economic recovery in the industrial countries.
 Reduced military spending, large budget deficits and declining imports from Eastern Europe slowed growth and aggravated the already acute problem of unemployment in Europe and North America.
 Rising anxiety over prospects for employment in the 1990s posed a serious threat to global trade negotiations and to the prospects for growth in the developing world.
 Examination of the rising problem of unemployment in industrial nations led us to the formulation of a comprehensive strategy for full employment in the West.
 The Commission's fourth plenary meeting in Oslo during September 1992 focused on the issues of employment and transition.
 Our effort to examine each of these problems, both in depth and in relation to each other, was aided by the constitution of six working groups to study a wide gamut of issues related to peace, disarmament, food, employment and human development in the emerging global context.
 This report is based upon the findings and recommendations of these groups, which were presented and discussed during the fifth and final plenary meeting at the Carter Presidential Center in Atlanta in October 1993.

“See the torches?” Harruq asked, pointing.
 His brother nodded.
 “Velixar’s nightmares have pulled them from their slumber.
 It would be too easy otherwise.”
 “It’s going to be easy anyway,” Harruq said, drawing his blades.
 The soft red glow splashed across their faces.
 “Are you ready, brother?”
 “I am,” he lied.
 “Let’s go.”

I watched from the trees as a rainbow of a half dozen tassels fluttered behind him where he rushed down the path toward the village.
 When I walked through the door, I saw immediately Fannie had not expected company.
 The telltale signs of a hurried cleaning spell were everywhere.
 I slipped into one of the low chairs to enjoy a bowl of berries set out for company under the guise of politeness.
 We didn’t often have visitors, and I could count on a new spruce twig the times we’d had fresh berries.
 Might as well enjoy them.
 I popped a ripe juneberry into my mouth as Aunt Fannie rounded the corner.
 She was on her way into the room, having dashed back to her stash of wine as soon as the visitor had hit the door.
 She peered at me out of the corner of her eye, twisting the cork free of the bottle.
 Maybe it annoyed her to see I was eating her berries.

The only parts clear to me were the days since Chevelle walked through Junnie’s door.
 I thought of how I had cursed him when I’d found he was my watcher.
 The hate in my voice when I’d demanded my memories back.
 The memories of his family’s murder.
 My mind writhed with anguish through the night.
 As I emerged from the shelter late the next morning, I was resigned.
 I would continue my journey with him and let him return me to the council without resistance.
 It was all I could do.
 I found him sitting near the shelter’s entrance, distress apparent in his features.
 “Thank you,” I said, indicating the shelter.

“They are there.” The men stood, motionless and staring until Anvil crossed the room to retrieve the map.
 He bowed a little as he took the paper from my hands and then hurried out, Grey following.
 Chevelle stayed.
 Ruby turned to him and breathed a deep sigh but he didn’t respond.
 My head throbbed and I groaned as I pressed the bridge of my nose.
 He was beside me in a flash, unspeaking.
 Ruby handed me another drink.
 It helped, but I was still irritated about the binding.
 “Does this mean we’ll have to train again?” Ruby snickered.
 Chevelle answered slowly, “There has to be a way.

"Hi, Rick," Lauri called from the kitchen.
 "Hi--what's for dinner?"
 "Steak, baked potato, and salad--chocolate cake for dessert.
 Sharon insisted we keep it simple."
 Rick smiled, accepting the cup of tea Ted had known he'd want.
 "I'm liking this girl better and better."
 She arrived five minutes later, and Rick's earlier impressions held.
 She was pretty and slender, friendly but just reticent enough to convince him he wasn't being pursued.
 "Lauri says you're a paralegal," Rick said as they sat sipping tea and coffee before dinner.
 "Yeah--in Charlestown."

A young boy sitting in the front passenger seat stares back at me as if to say, “What are you looking at?” I was once that baby in the backseat and my brother that inquisitive one in the front.
 My father wouldn’t have been in the car either.
 He disappeared long before I could commit him to my young memory.
 Chapter 4: The Sixties and the Single Mom I don’t remember many details of my early childhood.
 As much as I try, I cannot visualize my father, Richard, in any setting.
 I remember my mother, my brother, grandparents, babysitters, uncles, friends, and different events but I just can’t place my father anywhere.
 My parents divorced in the early sixties and my brother Thomas and I were very young.
 We took a train ride from Kansas to California; my mother told us we were on an adventure.
 We were far too young to comprehend divorce so there was no reason for her to explain.
 Our dogs, Ringo and Trixie, were caged in the back of the train, surrounded by luggage.

"...out in the south end of Zions.
 It was Mark Childs and Lessi Arnolds.
 The bodies were a couple of days old by the time search and rescue found them, but it was pretty obvious they'd been mauled by something."
 I opened my mouth to interrupt, but my vocal chords weren't working.
 Now that she'd finally broached the subject, Britney was unstoppable.
 "It had to have been a mountain lion, there isn't anything else around here that's both aggressive and big enough to kill people, but neither of them had been gnawed on at all, which was strange enough by itself.
 Everyone refusing to talk about it would've been enough to make it X-Files weird, but when the coroner threw such a fit, it entered a class of its own."
 Britney looked around again to make sure nobody was in hearing range, and then leaned in even closer.
 "He said the wounds weren't made by anything in the cat family.
 He wrote up a whole paper on how the teeth marks were made by some kind of new, previously undiscovered predator."

The growth of the World Wide Web has given rise to on-line global markets in which individuals can bid for a broad range of projects involving activities such as research, translation, technical writing, proofreading, desktop publishing, and business consulting.
 A new publication identifies a few hundred self-employment opportunities of this kind.
 The future of work will offer increasing opportunities for people throughout the world to match their specialized knowledge and skills with specialized employment opportunities wherever they may originate.
 Meeting the Skill Shortage: Perhaps the single greatest opportunity for employment growth lies in addressing the growing mismatch between the skills of job seekers and the skills required for expanding economies.
 In both industrial and developing countries, workers may be in surplus, but the skills needed are in deficit.
 In the most prosperous nations, the deficit is concentrated in high technology and professional sectors, in electronics, biotechnology, health care, pharmacology, mathematics, marketing, financial services, and the like.
 The adoption of new technologies even in traditional occupations has resulted in a growing demand for higher skill levels in these fields as well.
 Unemployment is highest among the least educated, least skilled categories, such as machine operators, fabricators and labourers.
 The poor are poor both because they have no assets and because their time and labour have low or no economic value.
 Poverty persists wherever the human resource is under-valued.

 On her parents’ bed, in the afternoon, with the door locked and people milling about outside.

I'm not upset."
 They went to the grocery store that evening and bought ingredients for the next day's dinner.
 Rick had called his sister, and she'd been thrilled Rick had a girl he wanted her to meet and mad that he hadn't invited her sooner.
 If Marie was going to make dinner at his house, they'd obviously been dating long enough to feel pretty comfortable together.
 "I shouldn't have made garlic bread.
 All evening my breath will smell like garlic," Marie told Rick as she finished making dinner the next evening.
 "So will everyone else's."
 "Are you sure Teri likes garlic?"
 "She loves it."
 "What about Jeremy?

Harruq snarled and shook his head.
 He shouldn’t have spoken to him.
 Shouldn’t have let him ask questions.
 The last of his adrenaline faded as images of the child’s quivering lips and trembling hands haunted his vision.
 “Half,” Harruq whispered as he wiped blood from his swords onto the grass.
 “Only half.”
 The kill had been quick, just a single cut through the shoulder blade, the heart, and then the lung.
 No suffering, little pain.
 It was all he could offer.
 “He’s dead, Qurrah,” the half-orc shouted.

I want to see what this dwarf was talking about when he said that everything was already arranged.” “I agree.” I grabbed my backpack.
 “Wait, are we going to go?” Seth and Jason grinned at me and said together, “You bet.” “That is if we can find the place,” Emily reminded them.
 I turned the door knob and walked into the kitchen.
 My mom and dad were sitting in the living room looking extremely excited.
 Before I even had a chance to say hi, my mom jumped up and rushed over to me.
 “You never told us that you applied for a summer camp!” my mom squealed happily.
 “You also didn’t tell us that you were to be picked from the best.
 Congratulations!” She hugged me.
 “Um,” I choked out in surprise as I was squeezed, “I wanted it to be…uh…a surprise.” I managed to get the words out and seem intelligent.
 My mom released me from her clamp-like hug, “Well I am surprised, and very proud!” “Thank you?” I said slowly.

It was woodsy and cool and we shared a two-bedroom unit with a common kitchen and a family room with a fireplace.
 It wasn’t much but it was everything to my wife and me.
 We took long walks as a family and we talked like we hadn’t in years, or possibly ever.
 We sat by the fireplace and cooked meals together in this tiny motel kitchen.
 We hiked one day through the forest and climbed a small mountain where we stood together and looked out at the beauty of the nature that surrounded us.
 When your children are young you have many special moments and they pass by so fast because they are so frequent.
 People always warn you how fast your children will grow and one day it happens and you realize that you were warned.
 When your children get old enough to move out of your home, you have very few opportunities to have special family moments and that makes them even more wonderful.
 We returned to our home after the trip and we went to bed late that night.
 I woke that morning before my wife and my sons.

It is time that we stop resisting or resenting this trend, but rather strive to adapt by shifting our focus toward those fields of employment which are most directly stimulated by technological innovation.
 Export of commercial services already accounts for 20 per cent of world trade.
 The shift from manufacturing to services is a positive and inevitable expression of the elevation of human activity from the physical to the mental level, which is the central reason for the phenomenal rise in global living standards over the past century.
 Rich nations have become rich through a shift of workers from the primary farm sector to value-added, non-farm secondary and tertiary sectors.
 Poverty and hunger persist so long as a majority of the population depend upon the routine operations of farming for their livelihood.
 This is also the cause of the growing feminization of poverty in developing countries.
 Today’s developed nations arrived at their present position by a long, slow migration from agriculture to manufacturing to service sector, but that does not mean developing countries must follow the same path.
 The growing demand for services in the developed world coupled with rapid strides in telecommunications has created the possibility of skipping steps to abridge the development process.
 Even within developing countries, surging demand for education, health care, tourism, communication, financial and retail services has opened up opportunities that were available to the developed countries only at a much later stage in their development.
 Outsourcing: During the last decade enormous attention has been focused on the lucrative employment potentials generated by Information and Communication Technology (ICT), particularly the high paid jobs in computer software and hardware and the less technical jobs in business process outsourcing.

Whatever it was, it left my skin feeling warmer than usual, and more than a little tight.
 Even after I looked away with a flush of embarrassment, I still felt like I could feel his eyes watching me.
 I could feel his presence behind and to the left of me, like a gentle tingle of electricity I could've pointed to even with my eyes closed.
 I resisted the urge to look back again as the lights dimmed and the orchestra began the opening strains of the first number.
 The actor playing Jean Valjean strode out onto the stage, and even weighed down by chains, he still commanded everyone's attention as though he was a member of the nobility.
 Each successive character somehow managed to latch onto my heart as they arrived.
 Despite the nagging sensation that I could feel Alec behind me, the first few minutes of the play exceeded all my hopes.
 That all changed when they started 'Lovely Ladies'.
 It was my absolute least favorite song on the whole soundtrack.
 Frankly the whole play would've been better if they'd just left it off.

Strategies for Developing Countries
 For the developing countries as a whole, the most critical question is how to create quickly hundreds of millions of jobs for the poor with limited purchasing power and limited capital for investment.
 The idea that most of these jobs could be created in the corporate sector or by government-sponsored activities has been put to rest.
 Currently, there are nearly one billion self-employed and unpaid family workers in the world, most of them self-employed farmers in developing countries.
 The self-employed represent 48 per cent of the workforce in low-income economies (less than $500 per capita GDP).
 For any strategy to be successful, it must give central importance to self-employment and entrepreneurship, with emphasis on agriculture, agro-industry and small firms in the informal sector.
 While a single approach will not be applicable to countries and regions of the world in different stages of development, a number of common principles and strategies are widely applicable.
 Agriculture as an engine
 Slightly more than half the world’s workforce, of whom 30 per cent are women, are still engaged in agriculture.
 Agriculture will remain the largest single occupation for the foreseeable future.

The elf whistled, and to the brothers’ surprise a winged horse landed on the rooftop of a nearby home.
 Its skin and mane were sparkling white.
 Dieredon bowed one last time and then leapt into the air, using the ledge of a window to swing himself onto the roof.
 He mounted his horse, patted her side, and then took off into the night.
 “Damn it all!” Antonil shouted, slamming his mailed fist into the wall.
 Still shaking his head, he stormed back to the gate, muttering curses.
 “What was that all about?” Harruq asked.
 “King Vaelor asked for aid and the elves declined,” Qurrah answered, chuckling.
 “The King’s pride will not take too kindly to that.”
 “He and his pride can suck a rotten egg,” Harruq said.

Peace, democracy and development are inseparable and interdependent.
 Liberal democracy and economic opportunity for all are essential ingredients for winning the war against terrorism.
 Accepting the spiritual principle which tells us that there is an element of truth even in the most outrageous or misinformed viewpoint, we must not only vehemently condemn but also sincerely recognize the unaddressed issues that underpin the urge for violence.
 In this sense, terrorists crudely expose the mental insincerity prevalent in international politics.
 Those who wield national power must come to realize that force of compulsion will not bring about a permanent reconciliation and amelioration of relationships in human affairs.
 Superior power must bring with it a superior sense of fairness and a commitment to constructive dialogue and action to attack the root causes of terrorism.
 It must shed its own accretion of mental insincerity cloaked as diplomacy.
 Then and then only these movements of violence will shrink and finally disappear.
 The period following September 11th, as US National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice put it, is one “not just of grave danger, but of enormous opportunity.”
 Resolving Local Conflicts: The Commission concluded that the end of the Cold War made it possible to successfully resolve problems that had resisted solution for decades, such as the many violent communal and ethnic conflicts occurring in the world.

As the guard collapsed to the ground, Rodregas fell with him.
 He tried to once more roll to the side, struggling away from a potential final stroke.
 Rodregas’ face was covered in gore and blood.
 It was hard for him to see.
 He struggled back up, but fell, then Rodregas felt a presence to his right.
 It was too small to be Doi’van and Rodregas staggered over reaching for him, determined to take one final slaver with him.
 His wounded leg buckled again, and Rodregas tried to reach for the ground to slow his fall, but something was wrong with his arm and it did not move.
 For a split second he saw the ground coming up to hit him in the face.
 And then... darkness.

I demand two lives for the two lives robbed me."
 Brandon's expression was confident and a little smug, and I somehow didn't doubt in the slightest that he'd expected Alec to calmly hand over two people to be executed.
 Alec hadn't even flinched at the demand.
 "Your wolves were lawbreakers who were executed before they could break further laws.
 The protection of the people, of the secrets that guard our nature from the dayborn, represents a law that supersedes any question of territory or dominance."
 The energy suddenly rolling off of the gathered shape shifters nearly drove me to my knees as Alec continued.
 "By their actions Adriana Paige learned of our nature, and it was only by the grace of the Maker that I was able to stop them from killing her.
 Their deaths were an unavoidable price to save an innocent."
 Some of the faces across the circle from me flinched a little, and I had a moment to wonder if Brandon hadn't told them the truth about what'd happened.
 "Her life belonged to me, it was mine to dispose of as I saw fit."

 His arms fell away from her.
 "I just--I'm .

 "I don't want to lose you either.
 Do you know what it feels like to be torn in two?
 To desperately want two things when you can only have one?"

Not that I wouldn’t have attempted it again anyway, but at least I know I’m safer now.
 No worries when I’m out of the castle.
 My sister is out every day but I can never seem to find her.
 She keeps bringing back the strangest treasures.
 I have run for two days now.
 I think tomorrow I will follow her.
 She refuses to tell me where she goes, neither under threat nor for a bribe, so I’ll have to use stealth.
 ~ Today was brilliant.
 I left a sleeping Rune just in time to find my sister sneaking from the castle.
 I followed her all the way to her secret spot.

Heat crawled up my neck as I remembered climbing into his lap, and then again the second time I’d gotten out of bed.
 Ruby grinned at him conspiratorially.
 “Yes, so educational.” Had I talked in my sleep?
 Could this get any worse?
 Yes, it could.
 It came back to me then.
 I dropped into a chair, my head falling into my hands to cover my face.
 Ruby started to say something, but Chevelle cut her off.
 “Won’t you offer your guest breakfast?” She sniffed.
 “Lunch maybe.” A plate of food landed on the table in front of me with a slap.

A couple of heartbeats passed before I realized the pool of shadow before us was Jessica.
 She had her eyes closed and was rocking back and forth as Rachel carefully pulled her to us.
 I mirrored Rachel's actions, wrapping my free arm around Jess as I whipped my head back and forth in an effort to figure out what was going on.
 We were pressed up against one corner of the pavilion, with what I assumed was the rest of the pack between us and everyone else.
 For a moment the wall of bodies precluded figuring out what was going on, but then Isaac shifted slightly to the left, and I saw Brandon and Vincent through the gap.
 The pools of black where Vincent's eyes should have been finally made me aware of the prickle of energy arcing back and forth between the two rival groups.
 I couldn't imagine what it must feel like where Alec or Brandon were standing.
 Even just the fringe of power dancing over my arms and shoulders was enough to make me profoundly grateful I wasn't any closer to the epicenter.
 Vincent's sadistic smile sent shivers down my spine, but it was nothing compared to Brandon's expression.
 I'd known for a couple of weeks now that what the outside world saw was nothing more than a mask, but I hadn't realized just what was under the facade.

I'm not.
 But that's because it's been like a holiday, a visit.
 If I thought that I weren't going home--"  Her voice caught.
 "I understand."
 Rick nuzzled her temple.
 "But now that you're not going to marry Davis, will you at least stop feeling guilty when we kiss?"
 She smiled.
 "I like your kisses."
 "I like yours too."
 He pressed his lips to hers.

Finally he looked at his watch.
 It was 11:25.
 It had been 7:45 when they'd come into the garden.
 She was gone.
 CHAPTER THIRTEEN
 Tears were streaming down Marie's cheeks when the fog began to lift.
 She was in her own garden.
 She ran to her house, tearing open the door and dashing upstairs.
 She paused at her room long enough to toss her bag onto her bed and then dashed to her parents' room.

“Well, what did you think?” asked Harruq.
 “I think,” Qurrah said, “that was enjoyable.”
 The two paused, each thinking the same thing.
 Finally, Harruq voiced his thoughts.
 “You think Velixar knew it when he sent us to kill him?”
 Qurrah stretched, letting out a small sigh as his back popped.
 “Yes, I do,” he said.
 “Although I don’t know why.
 A test of some sort perhaps?”
 “Getting tired of tests,” Harruq said.

The right to employment must be constitutionally guaranteed to enable all citizens to exercise their fundamental right to food and health security and a share in national well-being.
 ICPF’s view called into question the blind faith in the wisdom of the unregulated market that was prevalent during the heady days of radical free-market economic doctrine following the collapse of the Soviet system.
 Critics claimed that achievement of full employment was impractical and therefore guaranteeing it was impossible.
 In response, the Commission argued that the level of employment in any society is the direct result of a nation’s laws, policies and modes of implementing them, not the result of impersonal forces of nature beyond human control.
 Employment is a product of human decisions and can be controlled.
 As the world has made enormous progress in halting and reversing environmental degradation, it can also eradicate the spectre of unemployment.
 What is required is genuine commitment enshrined and enforced as national policy.
 The Commission called on the nations of the world to recognize this right and enforce this guarantee.
 It is most appropriate that a meeting of the Commission is taking place during November 2004 in India, where the Government of India has proclaimed their recognition of this right and their commitment to enforce it through an act of parliament.
 This meeting provides an opportunity to review the technological and public policy instruments now available to fulfil the human quest for “education, health, food, water and work for all and forever.”

All I could think of was the young children in the village, binding themselves to play the games of fairy children, who were unmagical until coming of age.
 I recalled seeing it in the documents in the briar patch—Francine Glaforia, bound against using all but practical magic.
 Bound.
 They must have known not to trust me.
 They must have known.
 My knees gave out and I crumpled to the ground.
 How many times could the earth be pulled from beneath my feet?
 Chevelle took a step toward me and I held up a hand to stop him.
 Bound against using magic.

Velixar was laughing.
 He stood, brushed off pieces of ice clinging to his robes, and then glared at her from afar.
 “Not good enough,” he said.
 Wild anger contorted his face.
 Black lightning thicker than a man’s arm tore down the street.
 Aurelia gasped as all her power flowed into her shield.
 The collision sent her flying, her magical barrier shattered into nothingness.
 The lightning continued, swirling about her body.
 Every nerve in her body shrieked with pain.
 She landed hard, unable to brace for the fall.

"So how did you like my sister?"
 Rick asked Marie when their guests had left.
 "She's really nice.
 So is Jeremy.
 I'd like to have them over again next week."
 He waited for her to add, "If I'm still here."
 When she didn't, he released a slow sigh of relief.
 "OK.  You probably won't be so nervous about it next time."
 She smiled, joining him on the sofa.
 "I might even use garlic again.

Johnny – What a stupid way to pose the question.
 Eugene – Life.
 For myself, I prefer life.
 For others, I prefer choice.
 Johnny – What does that mean?
 Eugene – I choose to live, but I leave it to other people to make their own choices.
 I don’t want to make their decisions for them.
 Jim – What does that have to do with anything?
 We’re talking about personal preference and you’re trying to move it up into the realm of philosophy.
 Eugene – I just thought it sounded good.

Rachel and I were already friends, so it made sense that she'd be nice to me, and Dominic at least knew who I was, but Donovan was nice to me right from the start.
 It's almost like he approves of me where some of the others aren't so sure Alec's dating me is a very good idea."
 Mallory's expression was far away as she spoke.
 "Yes, he would approve of the two of you.
 He's the consummate man servant, so very professional that you probably wouldn't ever know it if he didn't like you, but I'm sure he does.
 He approved of Alec's father's choice even back when most of the pack was still energetically opposed to the idea.
 He's always been one to see truly."
 "You are, I mean, you were close?"
 Her smile turned sad.
 "Actually, neither.

I want to spend as much time with you as possible.
 After all, it isn't like I'm going to be able to really get much rest between now and whenever we need to leave for the challenge."
 His wonderfully expressive face froze into the stony mask he wore so often with the rest of the world.
 "You weren't planning on bringing me, were you?"
 "It's not safe, Adri.
 I don't want to leave you anymore than you want to be left, but it's the only option."
 "No, it isn't, just bring me along."
 His fist clenched, knotting up the covers next to my head, but I was long past worrying he'd lose control of his beast and hurt me by accident.
 "You heard Mallory.
 The odds are very good that I'm not coming back.

I wish there was some way I could repay you for everything.
 --Adriana Chapter 7 My alarm clock jerked me out of a thankfully dream-free slumber.
 Actually, as I pulled myself out of bed I realized I'd had a virtual torrent of dreams, but none of them had been possessed of the strange vividness that'd begun haunting my waking moments.
 I hadn't had one of the special dreams, ergo I hadn't had any dreams last night.
 I really needed to get out of this town before whatever was in the water drove me completely crazy.
 Actually, I probably didn't have much time in which to affect my escape.
 When it came to craziness I was already halfway there.
 After all, I'd already been diagnosed with the kind of clinical condition nobody with less than eight years of school could even pronounce.
 As amusing as my internal monologue was, I didn't let it slow my normal morning preparations.
 Almost before I knew it, I was downstairs and once again facing the dreaded decision of whether or not to eat breakfast.

Rodregas blinked at the sunlight in his eyes and raised his hand to create some shade.
 Pain shot through his body at the movement.
 He felt his body, now without armor, for any serious wounds.
 “The good news is that while the tip of the lance did slice into your chest a bit, it is almost healed thanks to what Jordaan did,” said Doi’van standing above him.
 Rodregas realized he was lying on the ground over by where Doi’van had been keeping the lances and equipment.
 The spare lances were gone.
 He had lost.
 Doi’van was of course referring to the healing sigil.
 He wisely did not say it out loud as every squire there would have been asking about where they had gotten one.
 Rodregas started to get up, but quickly decided it was smarter to stay lying down for now.

 "No--these are the small ones.
 I'll go try the others."
 They bought the bigger pair and two shirts, and Marie wore the jeans and the red and navy shirt from the store.

 "You're welcome.
 Do you like them?"
 "Very much."
 She sighed.
 "But I suppose I shouldn't take them back with me."

Nothing of his histories, nothing of mine.
 But conversation had become easy as soon as I had spoken that first word, as soon as I had said his name and he’d smiled in return.
 I found myself leaning toward him as he spoke, actually paying attention in places; he had a pleasant voice and an unusual dialect.
 He wove histories as if they were stories of his childhood friends instead of useless facts, and I became enthralled.
 It felt as if we were alone there in the quiet corner of the third level, the occasional murmur below and whisper of flipping pages the only other sound in the dim setting.
 A small knothole made a window in the wall across from me and some light from the cloudy day occasionally came through, putting Chevelle’s face in shade.
 I had been right; his eyes appeared nearly black in the shadows.
 I leaned forward, listening to him as a small gray bird landed on the lip of the knothole.
 “Cheep.” Not many animals feared the elves.
 It even seemed curious as to what we were doing.

I'd worry about my family and how upset they are and how they'd always wonder what had happened to me."
 She took her toothbrush and put toothpaste on it.
 "I understand.
 But that doesn't make it any easier."
 Tossing his washcloth into the clothes basket, he picked up a brush, and when she straightened after having brushed her teeth, he began smoothing her hair with long, slow strokes.
 Marie closed her eyes, tears seeping from them.
 She stood still for as long as she could, but finally, unable to bear the tenderness of his touch, she turned around and took the brush from him.
 "I'll never be able to go to the shore or drive a car or-or shop for bathing suits without feeling pain because it'll make me think of you.
 I don't want to have to stop brushing my hair."
 He smiled just a bit.

Monetary variables are indicators of the functioning of an economy, but the essential factors which determine the strength and health of an economy are the productivity of its enterprises and its workforce and the material resources of the country.
 Tight monetary policy can generate intense short-term pressure for change in behaviour, but this pressure is applied indiscriminately and often with unexpected and unanticipated results.
 The primary result of premature liberalization of prices was to encourage trade and speculation while discouraging production and investment.
 It distracted attention from fundamental changes in institutions and social attitudes needed for the transition to be successful.
 Macro-level policy measures have to be complemented and supported by parallel micro-level efforts to educate the population about the new economic system, to generate a free flow of information – not just freedom, but the actual exchange of information, which is still severely limited in these countries – to develop new distribution systems, to impart appropriate business and managerial skills, to provide access to credit, to build up new social institutions and to en courage and promote new enterprises.
 In most cities of the former Soviet Union, for instance, there is not a single whole sale market for food.
 There are no systems for consumer credit, no agencies in charge of promoting small business development.
 In the absence of these and other essential micro-level conditions, even the right macro-level strategy will not evoke the anticipated response.
 6.Government regulation is essential for a free market: A free market does not mean an unregulated one.
 Quite understandably, decades of totalitarian government had generated such powerful resentment against strong government that by way of re action the society sought for solutions which did not require government to take a highly visible, leading role.

Dree’s nose bled for the first few minutes but after that she slept soundly and woke just before noon not knowing she had missed anything.
 Tomorrow, I try it on my watcher.
 Watcher.
 I fell asleep with her words in my thoughts.
 My imagination had filled in all the blanks, let the fear I’d been suppressing creep in, take over.
 It turned her words into my nightmares.
 Watchers and trackers, tassels and robes, Chevelle’s furious gaze as he pushed me from the cliff again.
 Chevelle.
 My watcher.

Jason walked the rest of the way up the hill and bent over to catch his breath.
 “We've been walking all day and you're not tired?” “Nope, I've got dancer muscles.” Jason sat on the ground.
 “Well, I have artist muscles and those are in my hands.” Emily rolled her eyes.
 “Then walk on your hands.” “No way!” he said.
 “Fine, then don't complain.” She climbed into a small tree that was near the cliff she had spotted.
 She leaned back and let out a sigh of relief.
 Her legs were killing her but she wasn't going to tell Jason that.
 He got up and sat at the base of the tree.
 “You had to take the good tree?” She motioned around.
 “There are plenty of trees to pick from Jason.

Employment in the East Asian economies is projected to grow by 37 per cent between 1990 and 2000, while the labour force will increase by only 17 per cent, leading to an increasing shortage of labour in the region.
 In contrast, employment growth is projected to lag behind labour force growth in South Asia, Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa.
 Although job growth has once again started in many OECD countries, economic growth alone will not be sufficient to bring down unemployment rates significantly, especially among youth and the long-term unemployed.
 Changes in values, attitudes, structures and policies will be necessary.
 Unless concerted action steps are taken, global unemployment will increase by 130 million during the 1990s.
 Our thesis is that there is a great deal that can be done to prevent this outcome and even reverse the trend, leading to sharply reduced levels of unemployment and progressive eradication of poverty over the next decade.
 How can we make such an optimistic prognosis in the face of the rising number of unemployed and rising concern of governments everywhere?
 Before presenting our case, it is necessary to challenge several basic concepts about job creation and unemployment.
 Destroying Myths about Job Destruction
 Two common, but pervasive, myths have gained ground that add an aura of scientific determinism to the fatalism regarding rising un employment: the first relates to technology, the second to trade.

“But I have fought the founders of the Council of Mages.
 I have killed men who thought themselves gods.
 I have died but once, to Ashhur himself.
 There is no shame in your defeat.”
 Aurelia struggled to her feet.
 The well of magic inside her was dry.
 In time, her strength would return, but she doubted the necromancer would give her a day to rest.
 She used a bit of the magic she did have left to summon her staff.
 If she were to die, she would die fighting any way she knew how.
 The man in black paused, extended his hands, and began to cast.

He may hate us all for all eternity, but I’m going to try anyway.
 I can’t just let him waste away like this.
 I’ll do my best by him.
 That is about all I can offer him.
 It’s all I could ever offer him, and it was never enough, your mother saw to that.
 I failed him as a father so far.
 We’ve all failed him.
 The entire world, even God.
 It’s no real wonder why he’s so damn angry with us all.
 I just hope we can reach to him before he decides to get revenge on life for the lot he has been cast.

He froze.
 Her eyes were clear and loving and .

 trusting.
 She trusted him not to hurt her, to do what was best for her.
 Groaning, he rolled off her.
 Marie immediately pushed herself up and over to lie on top of him, her mouth claiming his again.
 He couldn't help returning her kiss, but when she began kissing his neck, he croaked, "Sweetheart, please stop."
 She paused for just a second.

But the horse felt incredibly sluggish compared to his own mount.
 Hopefully, the horses positive qualities would shine in the tournament.
 As Rodregas circled around the courtyard warming up his horse he noticed fewer horses than he expected.
 After Doom Hoof seemed awake he headed over to where Doi’van stood.
 For this competition each squire was allowed a servant to provide support, mostly assistance with equipment, especially fresh lances.
 “Where is everyone?” he asked Doi’van.
 Doi’van did not look up from the ground where he was trying to straighten out a shield without doing more damage and said, “I wondered that myself.
 Apparently most drop out by this point.
 A lot have been injured, especially during yesterday’s sword and shield competition, and many simply quit due to not having any points yet.
 If you are going into the most dangerous part of the competition to be injured or killed and you have only one or two points, why bother?” Doi’van said.

It’s just seems so cheerful and happy, it really cheers me up.
 You must have been in a good mood when you painted it.
 Liz – That one is called ‘The Storm,’ it’s about my parents’ marriage and all the fights they have all while hiding it from the rest of the world.
 Jim – Oh, well it could have been cheerful.
 Sorry.
 I should have read the title, it was just so bright and happy looking, I gotta learn to pay attention.
 Liz – Yes you do need to pay attention, that’s how you got into trouble with…
 Jim – …I only did that once, and I have been watching for those conditions ever since.
 Liz – Too bad you weren’t paying attention the first time it happened.
 But let’s keep moving.

They say I signed up for some camp and-” “I know the same thing happened to me,” I interrupted her quickly.
 I hear her breathe heavily, “This is crazy, it’s just happening too fast.
 We have to go or we’ll be in big trouble with our parents.
 But the thing is we don’t know where this meeting place is and-” She was cut off by the ringing of my phone.
 “Wait a minute Emily, I’ll have to put you on hold.” She huffed in reply so I pressed a button and said, “Hello?” “It’s me, Jazell,” Jason’s voice said breathlessly.
 “I know where the meeting place is.” “Great Jason, where is it?” I asked.
 A shuffle of paper sounded as Jason moved around.
 “It’s at the art statue, the one we call the rising hill.
 It’s in the park, remember?” “Of course, when we were younger, we used to try to climb it.” I replied.
 I heard Jason chuckle.

The men, young and old, took up torches, shortswords, even rakes and sickles, and prepared to defend their homes.
 Bravely they fought, and bravely they died.
 “Run, run, run!” Jeremiah shouted to a mother pulling along a young boy.
 “Run west, and don’t look back!” A horrible shriek of pain tore his attention past them to a circle of torches, held by the gathered defenders of the small village.
 He kissed his sword as he approached, horrified by the massacre he saw in the dim light.
 A great half-orc bore down on a strong child of thirteen that Jeremiah knew well.
 Strength in fields and spirit meant little compared to the might of a warrior conducting the dark god’s power.
 Condemnation tore through his rusted sickle, cut his arm from his body, and then hooked around, severing his ankles.
 The boy fell, dying in four pieces.
 Jeremiah knew then he would enter the golden eternity before the dawn.

The establishment of the World Trade Organization paved the way for expanded markets for both developing and developed countries, fuelled a rapid expansion in World Trade, and wove strong bonds of interdependence between erstwhile antagonists across the globe from the Chinese mainland to North America.
 Larger private investment flows invigorated economic growth and made capital more accessible to larger numbers of people than ever before in human history.
 The European Union expanded to embrace newly democratic countries and blazed a path right through the former heartland of nationalism for the integration of the united peoples of Europe.
 Most important of all, the erstwhile very real and imminent threat of global confrontation and nuclear destruction radically diminished, spurred by negotiations between Russia and USA that have led to a 75 per cent reduction in the number of nuclear warheads stockpiled by both sides.
 ICPF’s report projected a vision of Uncommon Opportunities for rapid and radical advances in global peace and development.
 Its central thrust is the inextricable linkage between peace, employment, food security and human development.
 As peace is a sine quo non for development, creation of employment opportunities for all is essential for maintenance of peace and social stability, food security and eradication of all forms of poverty.
 The experience of the past decade strongly supports the view that a more peaceful global environment is more conducive for development.
 Military spending declined by a third in the years immediately following the end of the Cold War, partly due to real cuts in defence spending and partly due to the collapse of the Russian rouble and changes in the value attributed to Soviet arms spending.
 These real gains did not translate into a significant increase in foreign aid, which was what many hoped and expected.

But her choice for their last day in California was quite a change from that: she wanted to go to Disneyland.
 Mickey Mouse hadn't been around in 1927, and she found the whole idea of a fantasy land for children exciting.
 And she loved Splash Mountain.
 "Are you sad to be leaving?"
 Rick asked that evening as he watched her pack.
 "Yes.
 This has been a dream-come-true, and I'd like to stay in the dream."
 With a sigh she folded her baja and put it in her suitcase.
 He stood, placing his hands on her shoulders from behind.
 "If we get a chance, we'll come back."

It should have failed with all the men holding him down, but he now had celestial strength, and even with the knife wound he was strong.
 His attackers backed off, confused by the fact that he had gone from being their prisoner to suddenly rising.
 The person pinning Rodregas’ left arm got too far away.
 This gave Rodregas the leverage he needed to pull the arm free.
 He punched his assailant hard in the face.
 The attacker flew back and Rodregas jumped sideways to get more space.
 Rodregas rested his right hand on the knife blade still sticking out of his stomach.
 He was relieved to feel that it was not too deep.
 He had not taken off his armor.
 Although the knife had pierced the leather weave, the tip penetrated less than an inch.

It is the nature of the competitions that I am worried about.” Doi’van paused as he ordered the coming conversation in his mind.
 Rodregas knew him well enough to wait until he was ready.
 Rodregas had been surprised when Doi’van had refused to take back his oath when they had had some privacy.
 Doi’van had simply said he took his oaths too seriously to play such games.
 So Rodregas had sworn the same oath to Doi’van, which Doi’van had accepted.
 Doi’van though was more focused on the task than the oath.
 He stated, “Each competition is worth points.
 The top five winners of each round of competition earns five points; those that place six through ten earn four points, eleven through fifteen earn three points and so on.
 There are a total of five different events.” Rodregas nodded.
 He had not remembered the point system but he knew well that a knight is unique for his mastering of five different fighting styles.

My heart sank.
 I'd only thought things couldn't get any worse.
 Once everyone knew exactly why I was emotionally crippled they'd have even less sympathy.
 They'd pretend to feel sorry for me.
 They'd talk about how hard it must have been to suffer such a loss, but they wouldn't understand, wouldn't have the frame of reference to feel what I was feeling.
 They'd secretly talk about all of the people they knew who'd lost family members and been okay after a few weeks, or a couple of months.
 How even at their worst, those friends hadn't collapsed at the mention of their departed loved ones.
 My pulse was already almost twice as fast as normal, and the room was just starting to wobble from side to side.
 Rachel was saying something, but I couldn't really hear her.
 The void was gaping below me, when something grabbed my shoulder and shook me surprisingly hard.

I guess I’m one of her fans though.
 Karen – Are you some sort of dirty old man?
 Art – Well you know I usually don’t try to be.
 Why do you ask?
 Have I come across as one?
 Karen – You claim that you’re not an art fan.
 You don’t work for Miss Struan, and you’re not a family member.
 Yet you’re here.
 And you seem to know a lot about Elizabeth and her artwork.
 It gives me the distinct impression that you are an obsessed fan.

Emily was fumbling with her bike lock, which was old and rusted and usually refused to work without a fight.
 I walked over and tried to help her.
 “Why do you think Seth won’t tell us what he was doing?” I asked, watching her because she had refused to let me help.
 “Pride purposes?
 He was yelling at you when he broke his own rules.
 He just doesn’t want to admit he did” she said through her wild hair.
 Her lock finally clicked and she stood up.
 The boys were walking side by side towards the play set.
 It wasn’t actually that small but it looked that way from the street.
 There were six swings and a tower with four slides attached to it.

They checked into their rooms, which were side by side, and Rick suggested that Marie unpack while he ordered a pizza.
 "I don't feel like unpacking and sitting around.
 Can't we go out for dinner?"
 "Aren't you tired?"
 "No!
 I wish we could do something right away."
 "The studios will be closed, but we can go dancing if you like."
 "Wonderful!"
 Each took a quick shower and changed clothes.
 Rick would have taken her to a nice restaurant, but she had her heart set on pizza.

I brushed the dirt off my pants and followed Seth, who was walking off to the side.
 He went down to the left of the ledge and followed a steep path.
 I walked behind him and had to dig my heels in to avoid from slipping down.
 The path ended and Seth had to jump down to reach the bottom.
 He landed gracefully but almost tripped.
 I walked up to the edge of the path and jumped off.
 I flung my arms out to steady myself.
 Seth grinned at my clumsiness and waited for me to walk up to him.
 I wacked his head with the back of my hand, making his hair stick up.
 He smoothed it down and we walked across the flat ground.

 “What should we do?” one elf shouted above the wind roaring past their ears.
 “Unleash our arrows,” Dieredon shouted back.
 “Watch for the necromancer.
 Ignore the undead once you locate him.”
 The blasphemous blanket of darkness stretched out below them like a great fog, filled with bobbing heads of Velixar’s army.
 In that chaotic mass, Dieredon knew the man in black would remain well hidden.
 Not until enough of the undead had been massacred.
 He readied his bow, his strong legs the only thing holding him to Sonowin.
 Three arrows pressed against the string of the bow, their tips dipped in holy water.

The small room also had glass ceilings but they were dimmer.
 The room was dark and cold, with dust in the air.
 “I was wondering when you would get here,” a familiar voice said.
 I jumped and looked into one of the corners.
 The girl from my dreams walked out, shimmering.
 She smiled and I then noticed the bow hanging on her back with a quiver of arrows.
 “You know how you asked for my name before?
 I can tell you now,” she said.
 “Actually, I can tell you a lot.” “Great, I’m all ears.” She laughed.
 “My name is June and like you, I was once a full human.” “You’re a half-ling?” I asked in amazement.

 well, as I said, he'll be here within the hour."
 To Marie's amazement, after her father had bathed, shaved, and dressed, he rejoined them in the living room with a cup of coffee.
 "Aren't you going to the office, Father?"
 "The day I get my daughter back?
 Not likely."
 John stood then.
 "May I assume then that it's permissible for me to take the day off, Father?"
 Marie stared at her brother.

My heart stuttered and threatened to quit as his lips slowly came down to meet mine.
 My only other experience had been so terrible that I nearly panicked, but before I could formulate a protest, or even decide if a protest was what I wanted, our flesh touched.
 The contact immediately drove every other thought from my mind.
 His lips were the perfect combination of firm and soft, and the heart that'd been all but stopped a second before sped up to heart attack rates, slamming itself against my chest in an effort to get closer to him.
 All of my senses were blending together.
 I couldn't tell if he smelled incredible, tasted like heaven, or if it was all just a side effect of the energy which had gone from tingling to crackling as soon as our faces touched.
 My inhibitions, the ones that'd always kept me from acting on the occasional amorous impulse, evaporated sometime in the first half second, and I found myself with both arms wrapped around his neck, clinging to him with all my strength.
 Later I'd probably claim it was to steady myself against the wave of dizziness, but right now I knew it was because I wanted him more than anything I'd ever experienced.
 Alec pulled me away, held me at arm's length while I gasped for air, and then once I calmed down a little, he smiled and pulled me in close again, just for a hug this time.
 I tried to turn it into a kiss, but he deftly avoided my attempt, burying his face in my hair.

The other guards laughed and shouted in agreement.
 They had spread out, flanking the half-orcs on all sides.
 The leader stepped forward and gestured with his weapon.
 “You know what this is?
 This detects elves, and every elf I find I get to politely escort out of the city.
 Oh, and their possessions, well, obviously they were stolen.
 That coin you got there, you might as well hand it over before I take it.”
 Qurrah glared while Harruq clutched the coins tighter and fought down his anger.
 He glanced back to the shed, cursing his idiocy for not retrieving his weapons while he had the chance.
 “The coin,” demanded a guard to their right.

Though I have never met the buyer, I have been assured by his girlfriend that he will have the money and the deal will take only a few minutes.
 I also know that Ashley is seriously addicted to Oxy.
 After we first met—at her apartment—she called me several times just to get a few pills to hold her over until we could meet for this drug deal.
 I have refused her every time as I have told her that we will meet just the one time and exchange all the drugs for the money at once.
 She has tried to entice me with her young body in exchange for a couple Oxy, but I have resisted the temptation.
 The first time Ashley and I met I had the pleasure of seeing her naked body, but my goal is not to see it again, my goal is to do this drug deal.
 Her actions highlight that she is seriously addicted and that is not comforting when I am taking her word that Steve is a trustworthy drug dealer, as if there is such a thing.
 Another car approaches and it is white, but I cannot tell the make of the vehicle.
 As it passes, I check it out and see that it is a woman with two small children.
 She is handing a baby bottle towards a car seat in the back.

To die in combat is a glorious fate, Qurrah.
 Never forget it.
 The blessings of gods linger in those who fight and fall valiantly.”
 Qurrah nodded.
 He could feel power creeping out of his master, cold and fierce.
 Soft purple dust flew from his pale hands.
 “The trust between man and elf is broken,” Velixar said.
 “Let the harvest of their distrust begin.”
 Arcane words of power flowed from Velixar.
 Qurrah knew them, knew their purpose.

He wasn't sure this trip was such a good idea after all.
 Sharing her dream was going to make him fall even more deeply in love with her.
 And when she left, he'd be devastated.
 But remembering the excitement on her face as she'd danced with the actor, he couldn't regret it.
 The next day they went to Universal Studios.
 "This is set up like an amusement park," Rick told her as he bought their tickets.
 "So even if it isn't authentic, I think you'll enjoy it."
 "I know I will."
 In reality, she wasn't sure.
 The term "amusement park" conjured up visions of carousels and ferris wheels.

Caught up in the evening's enchantment, she gazed up into his eyes, hoping he'd kiss her again.
 But Davis stepped back and turned to draw her arm through his, grinding his teeth.
 He wanted to throw her to the ground and tear off her clothes, and every time he was alone with this beautiful ingénue, his self-control took a tremendous beating.
 All that made him maintain it was the knowledge that her father would kill him if he laid a finger on her before marriage.
 He glanced at his watch; he'd get Marie home by midnight and then spend a couple of hours at Mae's establishment.
 "Now it is a perfect evening."
 Marie smiled.
 "Every night in Hollywood must be like this."
 He laughed.
 "What makes you think that?"

The rapidly falling value of local currencies minimized their utility as a medium of exchange.
 Agricultural as well as industrial enterprises seeking a stable medium in which to hold their wealth increasingly resorted to hoarding marketable, non-perishable commodities such as food grains or converting local currency into foreign money wherever possible.
 This was particularly devastating for agriculture, where higher production was desperately needed to meet consumer demand and reduce dependence on food imports.
 The breakdown of the local currency as an effective medium of exchange was accompanied by an unfavourable shift in the terms of trade between agriculture and industry, resulting from the near-monopolistic position both of the suppliers of farm inputs, especially fertilizers and farm machinery, and the processing units that purchased farm produce, such as dairies and meat processing plants.
 Together, these factors precipitated a rapid fall in farm production and food availability.
 There can be no solution to the food problem without first establishing a stable medium of exchange.
 5.Macro-level policy must be complemented by micro-level change: Putting in place the right macro-level policies may be necessary, but it is far from sufficient to create a functioning market.
 The governments of the region have been so preoccupied with ‘re-engineering’ their economic and political systems and with meeting the conditions to attract foreign aid and investment that they have tended to over look the many essential and practical steps needed to implement the reforms on the ground.
 Even if governments had been able to get all the laws and economic policies ‘right’ the first time, there is no assurance that the actual impact on the people would have been less harsh than it has been.
 The so-called ‘shock therapy’ strategy pursued by these countries has been widely criticized for its severity and seeming indifference to social costs.

"OK."  He kissed her lips softly and went to change.
 Marie went to the kitchen to get a cold wonton to nibble on.
 She couldn't believe she was going home!
 She'd spend all day tomorrow talking to her mother, and her father would probably come home from work at a reasonable hour.
 And she’d get Tom to take her to see her brother this weekend.
 She didn't know how she was going to explain her disappearance.
 She couldn't very well tell them she'd gone 84 years into the future--they'd think she'd lost her mind.
 Maybe she could pretend to have amnesia.
 No--she was going to tell her mother all about Rick.
 She knew that she wouldn't be able to keep quiet about him even if she wanted to.

Seconds later, he was startled by a giggle that interrupted their kiss.
 "What's so funny?"
 he demanded.
 "It works!"
 "What works?"
 "I thought about kissing you while I was looking at you, and you kissed me!"
 He shook his head.
 "So you were experimenting.
 You didn't really want to kiss me--you just wanted to see if you could get me to do it."
 "Oh, Rick, that's not true!"

“A single opponent allows you to use more energy, focus only on that and let yourself…” My thoughts were wandering.
 Cursed dust.
 “… but with a number of opponents, you have to conserve your energy so you don’t leave yourself too weak…” I was watching his mouth move as he spoke but losing the words.
 I couldn’t focus.
 “… tactics that do not drain your energy.
 Protect yourself…” I was leaning toward him.
 Cursed fool.
 “… even hand-to-hand combat or choose a weapon.
 Ruby’s whip, a staff…” Cursed Ruby.
 Grrr… “Frey.” “Hm?” He shook his head.

“Were you able to track her?” Junnie asked in a low voice.
 “Not exactly.
 She’s following me.” Heat flooded my face.
 I couldn’t believe he’d fooled me again.
 I didn’t care what else they had to say.
 I stood and marched away, fuming at the idea that both of them were in on it.
 They might have been council, but it didn’t stop the feeling of betrayal.
 They’d lied to me, acted as if they’d cared.
 I was done with them.
 With everyone.

He was right.
 And she didn't think she'd stop him even knowing that they would end up making love.
 Half an hour later Marie sat up.
 "I guess I'd better go get dressed."
 "OK." "I'm not going to take a shower.
 I've lain with you all night, and I want to have your scent on me as long as possible."
 He smiled a bit.
 "I'll go take this shirt off and put it in a bag."
 She went to her room and put on a set of black lace underwear and a set of emerald on top of that.
 Now that she knew Rick was the key to opening the door, she wasn’t worried that clothing from 2011 would keep her from getting back.

Felewen charged, desperate to arrive before her brethren were overwhelmed.
 Aurelia stepped into the street and summoned her magic.
 Frost surrounded her hands, and a thin sheet of ice spread beneath the human soldiers.
 Many of them stumbled, unable to balance the sword and shield in their hands and the heavy chainmail on their bodies.
 Felewen slid on one leg, her sword out and ready.
 She passed right between two men, slicing out heels and tendons as she flew by.
 The elf reached the end of the ice, turned, and went sliding back.
 The two she had cut were on the ground, unable to stand after such precise hits.
 As she reached them, she stabbed one of their legs to halt her momentum, yanked her sword free, and then rolled around to stab the other in the throat.
 Another roll back, and she delivered the first soldier the same fate.

The package he’d traded my stone for.
 I pulled the material back to reveal a leather-bound book.
 Afraid Ruby would catch me, I slid the book into my own pack and took it to my room.
 I’d already been in trouble for stealing one book but this was technically mine.
 It had been swapped for my ruby.
 I was careful anyway, pretending to lie down and placing the book where I could quickly cover it if I were caught.
 I ran my fingers over the dark leather cover, tracing the scripted V etched there.
 Vattier?
 The first pages had been torn from the bindings so I flipped through, finding several more damaged sections, some torn, some by water.
 I sighed.

They're pretty distracting all right, but don't waste your time.
 They'll never waste a thought on you or me, or pretty much anyone."
 The way she said their names implied they were a couple.
 Even if they weren't, she was probably right about not getting my hopes up.
 Especially considering the way Alec had looked at me there at the end.
 Despite my best efforts the question still slipped out.
 "They're together then?"
 Britney smirked.
 "You really are masochistic, aren't you?
 That's the rumor.

Wonder if they’re all afraid of getting vomit on them…
 Jim – Skinny is the comic relief.
 If the entire thing were just Sumo fighting, and killing his enemies, it would get kind of boring, so they have someone to laugh at.
 Skinny’s other job is to distract the bad guys while Sumo Assassin charges up his Super Sumo Slap Attack.
 And last but not least, Skinny is there to make sure that Sumo gets his money’s worth when they go eat at a buffet.
 Eugene – (laughs) They’re the dumbest pair of heroes ever.
 Jim (goes back to reading his comic book, till something occurs to him) Gene, is there something wrong?
 You haven’t acted like a gangster in the last two minutes, you feeling sick or something?
 Eugene – I gave up being a gangster last night.
 Jim – Huh?

Rick wanted to do much more than kiss her, and she was making it difficult to resist.
 He'd never held a woman so eager, so responsive to his slightest touch.
 But he had to stop.
 He had to stop now.
 He raised his head, straightening and pulling away.
 But Marie clung to him, rubbing her face against his neck.
 "Kiss me again, please," she murmured, raising her head to press her lips to his.
 He couldn't resist her, and his mouth began moving over hers again.
 But at last he forced himself to break away.
 "Marie, we have to stop," he told her, literally holding her at arm's length.

This is the ultimate justification for the insistence of the international lending community on harsh measures to stabilize the economy.
 If the previous stabilization programmes have not proved politically viable, socially acceptable or economically effective, alternative programmes similar to the Yugoslav strategy must be attempted without further delay, backed by the full commitment of government.
 In some cases, it may be necessary to temporarily reintroduce controls on wages and prices as an interim measure to stop the free fall of the currency.
 But whatever the method, it is essential that this effort be combined with simultaneous implementation of other essential policies.
 3.Eliminate crop losses: In Russia and the other republics of the former USSR, highest priority in agriculture must be given to efforts that will increase the availability of food and reduce the huge crop losses and massive food imports.
 These losses vary by crop and region but average between 25 and 50 per cent of total field production for major crops.
 A reduction in crop losses could completely eliminate millions of tons of grain imports.
 The reasons for such enormous losses include poor quality of seeds and planting material, the lack of sufficient local storage capacity, in efficient and inappropriate equipment for planting, harvesting, storage and processing, poorly motivated farm workers and short age of labour at harvest time.
 Demonstration projects have proved that potato losses can be reduced from 35 per cent to under 5 per cent in one year.
 A viable solution requires concerted and coordinated activity by government, industry and agriculture at a time when each is operating in isolation from the others.

Jim – I don’t think so.
 Dad did say that your birth was a bit longer than mine, but that wouldn’t have done anything.
 Johnny – Then why?
 Jim – Do you remember Grandpa Davis?
 Johnny – No, he died before I was born.
 Jim – I know, and no loss there.
 But do you remember what dad and other people said about him?
 Johnny – All I know is that he was supposed to be a religious lunatic.
 Jim – That he was.
 He had started his own church somewhere out West.

I remembered the tiny hawk he had made with magic and my disappointment when it had turned back to the dull gray rock.
 He had carved me this symbol with his own hands.
 Now I was completely ashamed of my actions the previous night.
 I closed my hand around it and noticed the painting on my wrist.
 A hawk.
 I knew I had to face him.
 This might be a peace offering.
 It might be my last chance.
 I stood and walked into the main room, clutching the figure in my fist for courage.
 Chevelle was not alone.

I was aware of their eyes on me before they uncomfortably turned away again.
 Chevelle approached me warily as I lay curled in a ball on my blankets, the book positioned in front of me.
 He tossed it aside but I no longer cared.
 He sat behind me and pulled me into his arms, holding me as I wept.
 It was more right than anything had been in a long, long time.
 I woke with new resolve.
 I stood, prepared to make things right, but something was… off.
 The group surrounded me, tense.
 I glanced around but couldn’t see why.
 And then, from nowhere, I was thrown into the air.

“Qurrah Tun, my lady,” Qurrah said with a bow that sent Harruq’s jaw dropping.
 “It is a pleasure to meet you.
 May I have the name of the one who has brought civility to my brother?”
 Aurelia laughed at Harruq’s flabbergasted look.
 “I am Aurelia Thyne,” she said, offering a quick curtsy.
 “And it will take years to civilize that big lug.
 I’m not sure I have the patience.”
 “If your patience matches your beauty then my brother will soon be dressed in nobles’ finest, sipping wine and commenting on the taxing errors of our dear King of Neldar.”
 Aurelia blushed.
 She smiled at Qurrah.

“What shall we do today?” I went back over our conversation, trying to find some meaning.
 Inspiration, or maybe distraction, hit me as I recalled the dark-headed stranger.
 “Lineages.” Junnie raised an eyebrow as I sped to the study, but I’d worry about Evelyn later.
 This was my chance to find out about this Chevelle Vattier.
 After a dozen or so volumes, my determination began to falter.
 There were so many lineages, but I needed something on the northern clans, something on Vattier, and Junnie didn’t have that.
 I’d need a library, maybe even the Council library.
 I shivered; I definitely wasn’t sure about that.
 Even if I worked up the nerve to sneak in, I didn’t have the magic to search documents to quickly find what I was after like the Council members did.
 I would have to stick to the village library.

(laughs)  It sounds funny now.
 I had this peace symbol, you know, the two finger symbol made of stars and stripes, and, Jesus, my mother sewed it on the back pocket of my jeans.
 This teacher—what was her name?
 was it freshman year, sophomore?
 Mrs. McGonnigle.
 I think that’s right.
 Funny thing is, you know, she was kind of a fox.
 Too foxy to try and control a roomful of libidos.
 She dressed like a stewardess, I remember.
 Anyway, she took one look at this patch on my ass and drew in her breath as if I had a picture of a couple fucking on my jeans—she literally turned white.

Raising the skills of society to those of countries higher up on the scale will enable the country to move to that higher level.
 Despite enormous expansion of educational and training institutions, most developing countries suffer from a shortage of quality vocational skills among the huge number of people at lower levels of the society who seek desperately to raise their standard of living.
 This shortage retards the growth in productivity and quality needed to meet domestic needs and achieve international competitiveness.
 The technical training in frastructure in these countries should be expanded by the establishment of craft and vocational training institutes at the local level in every community to impart a wide range of basic technical skills.
 A massive programme of basic vocational and skills training should be launched on a parallel with the 100 per cent literacy programmes that are now being promoted by many governments to wipe out rural illiteracy.
 The military in many developing countries possesses the organizational capabilities and experience with intensive training to assist with this task.
 An institutional gap exists in agricultural training systems.
 In most developing countries, agricultural colleges, universities and polytechnics train researchers, government, bank employees and extension officers, but not farmers.
 Producing more food with less water, less chemicals and less soil erosion requires high levels of skill.
 The chain of agricultural training needs to be filled out at the lower level by establishing thousands of village-level farm schools as proposed in the chapter on food security.

Emily was curled up a few feet away from me.
 Jason turned in his sleep, mumbling something unintelligent.
 I needed to talk to someone, but everyone was sleeping.
 I pushed Seth over and his eyes flew open.
 His hand went to his sword but he saw me and he relaxed.
 “What was the point of pushing me over, Jazell?” “Well, it seemed better than punching you in the side.
 Were you dreaming?” I asked.
 He shook his head.
 “Just a bunch of nonsense I don't even remember.
 Why, did you get another vision?” “Yes,” I said.

That’s the mystery and hopefully we’ll solve it one day.
 We were chosen for some unknown reason, but that reason doesn’t matter.
 All that matters is that we protect this town.
 Jason’s eyes flashed.
 I stood up and leaned over to him.
 “What Jason?” “Monsters, a whole bunch of them.
 I saw the movement near the pond.” He pointed to the pond that was just nestled in the woods.
 And with that, we were off.
 Running towards the pond to do what we do best, destroy monsters.
 Only this time it was different.

"Then you'll try again Tuesday morning."
 He squeezed her hand.
 "Don't worry, Marie.
 You'll get back sooner or later.
 And until you do, I'll take care of you.
 I promise."
 She went upstairs with him and said goodnight outside her bedroom door.
 But her heart began pounding with panic as she thought about the day she'd just spent in 2011.
 She'd worn trousers in town, and she'd embraced a man in public.
 And now she was spending the night alone with him in his house!

To protect myself.
 Because they intended to kill me, not capture.
 They intended to kill us all.
 And without magic, bound as I was, I didn’t stand a chance.
 My anxiety must have shown; Ruby shifted her jaw.
 “No.” I held up a hand up to stop her.
 “No more dust.” I stood.
 “Let’s just get back.
 Back to training.” They didn’t argue, though they were plainly concerned.
 We went to the ridge with the others, but we didn’t train.

Were you responsible for the Les Misérables tickets too?"
 "Why?
 What possible difference does it make one way or the other?"
 The words had lost most of their force, but none of the feeling behind them.
 "Because I want to understand.
 Why me?
 Why would you do all of that for me?"
 "You really don't understand?
 You saved Rachel from a beating.
 If for no other reason, then for that."

Rodregas had heard from the other guards that the cats were in heat, and as Ravenhurr had hoped, a Celestial Lion had sensed their presence while the lion was out during the full moon with the Wilde Hunt, and the great lion had spent the last few nights doing his best to impregnate both of the female beasts.
 The whole keep could hear the wild rutting going on.
 Ravenhurr then had goats released on the roof and the Celestial Lion had gorged himself on them when he had finished rutting.
 The well-satisfied beast lay limp, sleeping, confident in his celestial power, and oblivious to his surroundings.
 He lied unbound, as required by the ceremony.
 Rodregas assumed some subtle magic had been used to influence the beast to sleep in just the right spot.
 The unlikely success of having an actual celestial animal as part of the ceremony had put Ravenhurr into an unusually good mood.
 Using one of the Dire Cats in the ceremony would have been good, but an actual Celestial animal would provide much more power.
 Rodregas’ hands clutched into a fist at his side as he could not help thinking that the last thing the world needed was for Ravenhurr, or any of the Immortalists, to acquire more power.
 Rodregas knew there was almost no opposition to the Immortalist left, but futile as it would probably be Rodregas could no longer go along with their immoral acts.

Almost before I knew it I was sitting down in Physics.
 As usual, Alec slipped into class a half second before the bell.
 I was so happy I forgot how arrogant he was, and I smiled at him as he sat down.
 It was like he was looking at something that wasn't even human.
 My insides seemed to freeze and shrink.
 I couldn't even muster up my normal blush of embarrassment.
 I'd had plenty of people hate me since I'd arrived in Sanctuary, but he was the first person I'd met who I was convinced wouldn't have thrown me a life preserver if I was drowning.
 It wasn't even because saving me would be too much work.
 He was completely convinced the world would be a better place without me.
 I'd never been so unnerved in my life.

“Where were you during the commotion?” she repeated.
 “I’d think if you were at Junnie’s, you’d have known all about it.
 Why didn’t you warn me?” My mouth opened and closed.
 “Well,” I said, “Junnie sent me home early because I learned a spell.” Fannie looked incredulous, so I backpedaled.
 “Well, not a spell, but I grew a… flower.
 And then I was so excited I was going to run home and tell you… but I took the back way and then…” I swallowed.
 “Well, and then I got lost.
 Sorry.” Aunt Fannie was incensed, her curses flying out in a rant that felt as if it would never end.
 The years of listening to it seemed to coalesce, and I was suddenly exhausted.
 “I think I’ll go lie down.” “Do you think you can just sleep when you want to sleep?

Employment opportunities are directly linked to government tax policy concerning capital gains, depreciation, energy, wages and salaries, as well as by policies governing minimum wage laws, interest rates, budget deficits, imports and exports, environmental regulations and restrictions, defence spending, immigration, industrial development, investment, licensing of practitioners, zoning laws and countless other public policy issues.
 Without access to jobs, people lack the ability to ensure their own survival and support in modern society.
 As government has assured the right to education – indeed, compels it – it can and must also ensure the right of every person to gainful employment.
 Our very concept of the rights of the individual and the responsibilities of the society must undergo radical change.
 UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has called for a broader definition of human rights to include economic as well as political rights.
 The essential basis for meeting the world’s employment needs is the realization that employment is an absolute necessity for survival in modern society and must be recognized as a fundamental right of every human being.
 Pragmatism as well as idealism compels this step.
 Recognizing the right of every citizen to employment is the essential basis and the most effective strategy for generating the necessary political will to provide jobs for all.
 What is needed is not another job generation programme, but a change in social values that will accelerate the natural and inevitable evolution of society, from one in which labour is regarded as a dispensable resource to one based on full human rights and the enormous productive potential of the human being.
 The type and magnitude of change needed today is comparable to that embodied in President Roosevelt’s New Deal for the American people during the Great Depression, at a time when 25 per cent of the workforce was unemployed: to the Indian government’s decision to launch the Green Revolution in the mid-1960s to achieve self-sufficiency in foodgrains, at a time when the country was highly dependent on imported food to stave off famine: and to Mikhail Gorbachev’s initiatives late in the 1980s to end the Cold War and transform Soviet society.

As if on cue, they heard a collective roar from the south.
 Harruq glanced at the stairs along the wall, but Qurrah saw this and shook his head.
 “We need to get closer to the fight,” Qurrah said, slurring his words.
 “I need to see him.”
 “Sure thing,” Harruq agreed.
 “Come on.
 I have an idea.”
 He grabbed Qurrah’s arm and hooked his elbow around it.
 Qurrah was too weak to complain, so together they ran down the streets.
 They passed closed homes containing people praying for safety and victory.

You gave us such interesting details!” The image of Chevelle hearing my dreams, the sound of their laughter when I woke… I knew what she wanted and I gave it to her.
 Fire shot from my hands toward her, hotter than any I’d ever produced.
 The warmth hit my face and Ruby’s heeled boots sloshed as snow melted beneath her feet.
 She batted away the flames and smiled.
 “Come now, you’ll have to do better than that.” She kept circling.
 “Let me try harder.” She flicked her wrist, and the end of her whip caught my ankle so fast I hadn’t even realized it was moving.
 She jerked and my leg came out from under me, my hip slamming flat on the ground.
 It hurt.
 The pain stole the heat from my anger, and I struggled to stand.
 Crack!

That started what seemed like a war.
 All the dwarfs scrambled towards us and I simply shot them and Emily fried them.
 Then Jason and Seth dissolved from the shadows and entered the clearing.
 “What are you two doing here?” I yelled across to them, annoyed that they hadn’t made their presence known earlier.
 Seth fought his way over to me, “Why do you need to know?” “Because you just randomly appeared and I would like to know what you’re doing in Emily’s backyard in the middle of the night.” I pointed out and took down the last dwarf.
 We gathered around the barely burning embers, after we had re-entered our own world.
 Emily and I quickly summed up what we had learned from the dwarfs.
 Jason listened and didn’t speak, like usual, and for once Seth didn’t interrupt.
 When we were finished nobody said a word as they soaked up everything that had happened.
 It seemed like it was just too much for all of us to take in.

 His smile was a combination of pride and regret.
 "Mother says it represents my birth.
 She was always an excellent performer.
 Donovan says she would've been nationally acclaimed if she'd chosen to pursue a career instead of marrying my father.
 She didn't begin composing until after he was gone."
 In what was for me a rare display of common sense over curiosity, I shelved the rest of my questions and looked for something I could use to help him sidestep the memories.
 "Growing up surrounded by this, and neither you or Rachel play an instrument?"
 Alec shook his head.
 "I've never had the finesse to play anything.

No doubt she recognized how liars teach us not to trust.
 I believe it was Sylvia Curtis, when Eric and I talked to her about Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, who convinced me that Holden Caulfield was right to pour most of his wrath on phonies.
 When Olga Savitsky and I considered founding a church, we agreed that above the entrance would hang a sign, “No bullshit allowed.” After all, God is a matter of life and death.
 In Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig argues that being stuck is the best place for a mechanic (or a problem solver of any sort) to find himself.
 When we’re stuck, we come to the problem free from any preconceptions.
 I mean to test his argument, because I’m stuck on the word “adore.” Here’s how it happened: in the midst of a period of personal, family, and professional turmoil, I picked up The Practice of the Presence of God, by Brother Lawrence, and discovered that simply reading about this fellow from long ago delivers some peace.
 Not perfect peace, but closer than before.
 Close enough so that friends find my apparent serenity in the midst of turmoil worth remarking about.
 Brother Lawrence was a layman who lived and worked, mostly in the kitchen, at a monastery in sixteenth century France.
 I thank God for the book by and about him.

Marie went upstairs but didn't feel like lying down.
 Instead, she sat on her bed with her back against the headboard and her arms wrapped around her knees.
 Why did she feel so frightened?
 This was almost how she'd felt when she'd wandered into 2011.
 But then she'd been in a strange place; now she was home.
 She should be ecstatic.
 She'd tried for over five weeks to get home.
 Tuesday she'd spent a delightful day with her family, the best of her adult life.
 Her father had amazed her by showing her his love in a variety of ways.
 He and her brother had reconciled.

Jim – What is she like?
 Liz – Haven’t you met her yet?
 Jim – Nah, Art wasn’t ready to bring her to meet us, and then I had to go back to school.
 Liz – How long have you known about her?
 Jim – In general, I first heard about her the day of your show.
 I think he had known her for about four hours at the time, and he was already in love.
 Liz – I didn’t meet her for about a month or so after that, Art invited us all to dinner.
 Jim – For Johnny?
 Liz – For Johnny.
 Jim – How did he take it?

“Because we are.” “Do you think we should tell them about my vision?” I asked.
 He chewed his lip in frustration.
 “Maybe we should, but not include the parts about me.” “Seth,” I said slowly hoping he didn't get mad at me, “we should tell them what's going on with you eventually.
 What if Kojas comes for you and they have no clue why-” “No!” he said sharply, and the tone of his voice surprised me.
 “I can't Jazell, I wouldn't have told you if you hadn't ran after me demanding to know what I was hiding.” “But you're happy I did, right?” I asked.
 He looked away.
 “Yes I am.
 It's a lot better than hiding this on my own.
 The secret just keeps getting bigger.” I rolled my eyes.
 “Emily will find out eventually, and when she does, she'll kill you for keeping a secret from her.” “Let's hope it isn't until you and I figure this thing out.” I nodded and walked back into the cave.

She swallowed.
 "I'm still here."
 "I'm sorry."
 "Maybe I should go walk in the garden.
 That's how I got here, so that's probably the best way to get back."
 "That's a good idea, but it's getting late.
 You shouldn't be wandering around out there in 1927 or 2011.
 Why don't you wait until tomorrow morning?"
 He smiled, taking her hand.
 "Come on--dinner's almost ready."

Marie looked around eagerly as Rick drove to the hotel, but so far it didn't look much different from 2011 Boston.
 "Where are the studios we'll be touring?"
 she asked.
 "One's downtown, and the other is to the northwest of the city.
 Our hotel is right off the highway--we're almost there."
 "When will we see the movie studios?"
 "One tomorrow, one Tuesday.
 We'll get some brochures at the hotel and see what else sounds good to you for the rest of the week."
 They pulled up to the hotel minutes later.
 They checked into their rooms, which were side by side, and Rick suggested that Marie unpack while he ordered a pizza.

We discussed it and I’m going to believe that he does.
 Liz – When did it happen?
 Jim – I think today after Gene talked to him.
 I guess he met her here, and then they went out on a date.
 Liz – But that was only a few hours ago.
 Jim – I know.
 But he’s sure about it.
 Liz – Wow.
 Jim – That’s what I said.
 Liz- You’re taking it awfully well.

“Thank you master,” Harruq said, accepting three from his brother before kneeling as well.
 “We will await you in the chaos,” Qurrah said.
 Then the man was gone, vanishing into the shadows of the room.
 The two glanced at each other.
 Harruq shrugged.
 “That was easy.
 Bed time?”
 “Sleep if you must,” Qurrah said.
 “I will join you in a bit.”
 Harruq removed his armor, lay down on the bed of straw, and slept.

 I’ll see you later Gene.
 Eugene – Bye art, and thanks again.
 (Eugene and Art separate, Eugene walks off stage, Art starts looking for Jim and looking at the show, he keeps walking an looking around until Karen asks him a question)
 Karen – Excuse me sir, but is this the Lady Elizabeth Exhibit?
 Art – Is that what they called it?

“Hey don’t make me nag you about the time you almost took off my head with your throwing knifes.” Jason stopped dead and narrowed his eyes.
 “It was an accident.
 I didn’t know you’d run that way.” “Alright, we understand that we’ve all done stupid, foolish things.
 So let’s just add this accident to my list, okay?” I said quickly before the two started something.
 They nodded but shot each other smirks.
 I sighed, wondering why those two buffoons had been granted this power along, with Emily and me.
 It’s not like they weren’t foolish enough already.
 The day when it all changed was still a mystery to us.
 A lot of things happened that didn’t quite make sense.
 The four of us were already best friends.

“Why now, why do you have to ask?”
 “Answer me, brother.
 Now.”
 “No.
 I don’t love her.
 Is that what you want to hear?”
 The other half-orc tightened the grip on his whip.
 “Forget what I want.
 If you do not love her, then kill her.
 Now get your head beyond her and focus on the task at hand.

What point is sharpening your sword if you never wield it?”
 Harruq had no reply.
 Eyes low, he stepped out into the night, Aurelia trailing not far behind.
 They travelled deeper into the town.
 A knot grew in her stomach as she noticed he had both his swords, and as they approached the poorer parts of the town, the knot only tightened.
 She watched the half-orc glance in through the windows of the buildings he passed.
 She found herself praying he only meant to steal possessions…‌just possessions, nothing more.
 _Keep the swords sheathed,_ she prayed.
 _Sheathed and bloodless._
 He continued wandering, and she found herself circling several streets multiple times.

I batted my eyes and tried to shake it off, concentrating on Steed again.
 He seemed to notice I was back and continued his story.
 I leaned my head on his chest, snuggling into his warmth.
 My face felt numb.
 Somewhere in the distance, the door opened and the vibration in Steed’s chest quieted as his words cut off.
 My head turned dazedly toward the door, keeping it steady against Steed.
 Chevelle’s furious gaze flicked to my cloak piled on the floor before returning to us.
 Us.
 I was curled in Steed’s lap.
 Chevelle stormed toward us.

 For several years, I wrote a weekly column for the San Diego Reader.
 The nominal topic was people and their cars.
 One story was about Olga: Lately even George Bush talks of conservation and cutting our reliance on middle east oil.
 So I’m convinced it’s time we ask ourselves if living more like Olga Savitsky wouldn’t be preferable to the way we are living.

 Far away, ash floated on a cold breeze, sucked into a forgotten cavern within a chasm feared by orcs and goblins.
 On the damp floor it fell, coalescing into a black muck, which stirred by unseen and unfelt winds.
 Here a bone poked up from the filth, there a fingernail.
 Floating above, transfixed in patient stasis, a soul awaiting a host, shone two crimson eyes.
 * Note from the Author Note from the Author{{{1 A NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR
 I never set out to write a dark fantasy.
 I had two characters in my head, troubled half-orcs without home or family and whose decisions would one day bathe a world with war.
 To tell their story I had to start at the beginning, and the beginning is not kind.

When it was held horizontally in front, the right palm faced away from the body and the left hand faced the body, enabling the staff to rotate.
 The power for generated strikes was held by the backhand pulling the staff, while the front hand was used for guidance.
 When striking the wrist is twisted, the same as when one turned the hand over when punching.
 Rodregas’ eyes were quickly opened to the weapon and it was fun to learn something so new, but he was much worse for the lesson.
 After lunch he limped over to the great oak which they sat under most days for their magical training and reading.
 Imeralda was off in the trees taking care of nature’s business.
 As the two settled down he broached the subject on his mind.
 “Doi’van, are you mad at me?
 Is this something to do with me and Imeralda… getting together last night?” Rodregas asked.
 “What do you mean?” Doi’van asked clearly surprised.

What rights does the lord have in this situation?” Rodregas noticed the sorcerer seemed to stiffen at the question.
 Rodregas’ mind swirled.
 The first questions had been easy, but it had been a very long time since he had studied law.
 The sorcerer’s body language, though, directed his memory to the answer.
 Rodregas said, “The local lord is responsible for replacing the other lord messenger’s lame horse.
 There is nothing to be done for the Immortalist messenger’s horse.
 It is the responsibility of the local lords to provide mounts for the Guild at the local lord’s expense.” He made sure his voice remained rough with no emotion coloring his response, just a simple squire giving a by-the-book answer.
 The Knight Captain nodded and said, “Welcome to the tournament, Squire.” He then turned to look up at the sorcerer and asked him, “Any other questions Ambassador?” The sorcerer spoke his next question directly to Rodregas, “I noticed you have a Hellborn at your side, you would insult the faith of the Knights by bringing him into the Cathedral of the Heavens?” Rodregas knew this question would come up and had the natural answer, “They are my sworn followers.
 Sworn to the All-Father.” Such an oath could not be challenged here.
 “Truly?” the sorcerer said.

Don’t you see that?
 My friends, my family, my home; they are all gone from me.
 Because of you.
 Don’t make it all for nothing.”
 Harruq’s anger and frustration simmered and swirled in a dying fire.
 He could not argue with her, not about that.
 Even he could see what she had sacrificed to save his life.
 “Where do we go?” he asked, his voice revealing his defeat.
 “We’ll figure it out in the morning.
 For now, we travel north.

I didn’t know why I felt so protective of this secret.
 Chevelle drew a section of moss from one of the stones on the wall and it replaced the pebble.
 “Try this.
 They shouldn’t have bothered binding you from growing.” I concentrated on it.
 Nothing.
 But I was never good at that anyway.
 I shook my head.
 He nodded, giving up, but our hands still lay together, connecting us.
 “Where are they?” I asked.
 He’d been looking at our hands, but his eyes returned to my face at the question.

We did our best to stay out of his way, particularly when he was drinking, but he would always find us.
 My brother Thomas and I had become very good at yard work and chores as we learned to perform them with perfection or pay the price of Dino’s disappointment.
 Every weekend was filled with hours upon hours of yard work at Dino’s command.
 If we ran out of work to do, Dino would have us move a scrap woodpile from one end of the backyard to another, then back again if he wasn’t done with us.
 Sometimes Dino would stand in the backyard and direct us with a garden hose nozzle, spraying us from one chore to the next.
 Dino was sick.
 We never knew when we were going to get knocked across the room.
 We were often treated like unwanted animals.
 We wondered why this was happening to us but at the same time we wondered if the same thing was happening in the families across the street.
 Our half-brother, Harry (named after Dino’s father) was soon born.

He took his tea out to the garden.
 Gazing at the white roses, he sighed, wishing Marie would come down and share the beauty of the morning with him.
 He couldn't blame her for being mad, but he was getting desperate.
 He felt as if he were in a race to convince her to marry him before they reached a point where they were unable to stop themselves from making love.
 He couldn't keep pushing her away forever.
 It was a wonder he'd been able to stop himself--and her--this long.
 Being here was like being on vacation, she'd told him.
 He sipped his tea, trying to imagine what this was all really like for her.
 He remembered his first trip to Europe, the summer after he’d graduated from college.
 He'd spent a month in Great Britain and had loved it.

It doesn’t get much better than that, pop music-wise.
 “I read the news today oh boy” is just about the finest first line I’ve ever heard.
 I’d kill to have written that one line.
 But, does it compare to “April is the cruelest month?” Or “Turning and turning in the widening gyre?”  Or even, “Something there is that does not love a wall?”  No, of course not.
 And John would tell you the same thing.
 I’m not putting down The Beatles, hell, McCartney and Lennon are the greatest songwriting team of all time.
 No question.
 But, poets, naw, they ain’t that.
 Not in the strict meaning of the word.

Don’t let temptation lure me down to the Inn Spot again.’” Helga beamed, and leaned across the table.
 “You stayed home?
 Tell me you stayed home?” “Well, I stayed home all right, but that’s not the whole story.
 You see, the devil came for me.” “No.” Helga covered her face with both hands and peeked out.
 “Yes ma’am.
 He came right up and knocked on my door.” “But you didn’t let him in?” “Well, I wasn’t going to, but one look at that hunk of a man, and he got me in his spell.
 I hardly remember what happened.
 All I can tell you is, when I woke up in his arms this morning, I jumped out of his clutches and ran straight to here.
 You want to go home with me after the shift?
 If he’s still hanging around, maybe you can chase him off.” By now, Helga was wringing her hands.

I opened my mouth to comment on the fact that Brandon's pack was roughly twice the size of ours, only to realize that scurrying back home kind of precluded continuing to help out at the tutor lab.
 "What about helping Mrs.
 Campbell?"
 It shouldn't have surprised me that Alec thought it over for several seconds before shaking his head.
 Whatever else he was, he wasn't the thoughtless jerk Brandon had proven himself to be.
 "I'm sorry, Adriana.
 I wish we could, for Rachel's sake as well as yours, but it's just too risky.
 Fewer witnesses means more chance Brandon's people will try to arrange for something to happen.
 There are just too many of them for us to meet them in a stand-up fight and come out unscathed."
 I didn't like it.

There was no stopping them.
 I had no magic, no tracking skills, no clue.
 I stopped running.
 My heart pounded, the wind cutting against the damp sweat on my skin.
 I wanted to understand what had just happened, but I couldn’t process it.
 It was just too painful.
 I was confused, drained to the point of exhaustion.
 I had no way out.
 When they found me, I would have to surrender.
 I could see no other option.

I glared at him.
 “Time to resume your training.” They had me work with Anvil, trying to anticipate when he was preparing to send a small current of electricity toward me.
 Which meant I spent the day getting shocked.
 I was grateful when we finally stopped to make camp.
 I was afraid they would resume training after dinner, so I found a place off by myself and pretended to rest as I went back to reading the diary.
 Today was exhilarating.
 For the first time in I don’t know how long, I was out of the castle.
 Free from practice, free from duties, free from walls.
 Though tricky to set up, the spell worked on Rune.
 I showed up at practice early and whispered the words in case something went wrong and he heard.

He held his hand out, signaling me to wait.
 Then he beckoned me and I stood up.
 Then someone tapped me on the shoulder.
 I bit back a scream and whipped out my knife.
 But I dropped it in surprise as I spotted Emily standing over me, rocking back and forth on her heels.
 I squealed and hugged her tight.
 Jason was limping over with a grim expression on his face.
 “What I don’t get a hug too?” he asked.
 “I jumped down a deep hole for you.” “Uh…” I said, feeling awkward.
 Seth walked over and patted Jason on his back.

It didn't make us best friends and she was still an enigma, but it was a start.
 It even gave me hope maybe Jessica and James might eventually come around.
 I was still reeling in surprise as we walked out to the parking lot and met up with the rest of the pack, or rather the rest of the pack minus Alec.
 He'd shown up several minutes later, looking very satisfied with himself, but obviously unwilling to answer any questions.
 As we caravanned home, I realized the collection of vehicles carrying us back to Alec's estate probably cost more than my house.
 Donovan had met us at the door and conducted us to the dining room, where Alec and his friends devoured a sizable meal.
 Even back when I'd had a more substantial appetite, I still couldn't have kept up with the wolves.
 Even the girls packed away more food than I would've believed possible for such slender frames.
 I mentally shrugged and added it to the list of shape shifter benefits.
 Able to eat like a complete pig and still slip into size zero jeans.

All nations should advise the Secretary General of the human, technological and produc tive resources they are willing and able to place at the disposal of the UN.
 2.Each government should draw up an inventory of its military manpower, science, technology and other facilities which could be used to sustain the natural resource base, prevent environmental degradation and cooperate with other countries in combating regional and global threats to environmental security.
 The information should be shared with the UN Environmental Programme and the Sustain able Development Council.
 In each case it will be necessary to show how action implemented by the military will be more cost-effective than using traditional resources.
 3.A UN International Force for Development should be constituted under a democratized UN structure, consisting of demobilized military personnel and young professionals from different countries, which will be trained and equipped to promote people-centred, environmentally sound development initiatives that integrate political, social, economic and cultural factors.
 4.Global security is threatened by mass population movements, potential changes in sea levels, drought and famine.
 Greater international cooperation is needed in the sharing of national military manpower, under the auspices of a new UN Earth corps.
 Article 43 of the UN Charter, which was originally drawn up for dealing with the threat of conventional war, can be interpreted to apply to threats to environmental security as well.
 In parallel to a UN Earth corps, national Earth corps units should be constituted to operate within each state and for service internationally under the UN.
 Vocational skills imparted through these agencies will be of subsequent use to the community at large.

"You need to erase any evidence that you weren't here all night.
 Take a shower, change into some of your own clothes, and then go to sleep.
 We'll keep watch outside until your mom gets back."
 I opened my mouth to ask what would happen after that, but he was already gone, moving so quickly through the darkness that I wasn't even sure which direction he'd headed.
 I locked the door for the first time since we'd arrived in Sanctuary, turned on all the downstairs lights, and then slowly walked upstairs.
 It was crazy to be scared that Alec had somehow missed someone, but I couldn't shake the feeling I was being watched.
 Once I finally made it upstairs, I checked both rooms, and the bathroom, before finally relaxing a little.
 I showered quickly, carefully making sure the smell of alcohol and cigarette smoke was out of my hair, and then changed into clean clothes and collapsed onto my bed.
 I was exhausted, but I couldn't fall asleep.
 Every time I closed my eyes, I saw dark shapes hurtling towards me.

Whatever we need, whatever we want, it will be nothing but a flick of your wrist.” I froze.
 It was irrational, I knew, but anger seethed.
 I couldn’t stop myself from thinking he was just like everyone else, interested only in my powers.
 My magic.
 And how it would benefit him.
 I turned to him, glaring, and he drew back, startled.
 “Is that what you want, why you are so intent on marrying me?
 For my power?” He shook his head, mystified.
 The rage had overtaken me, though.
 The weeks of drugging Rune, sneaking out, my missing father—searching for a new wife, I was sure—all of it too much.

This surprising turn of events has led some to re-examine the incredible achievements of the period and conclude that they were either vastly overstated or, perhaps, even illusory.
 Others have come to take these achievements for granted.
 Still others have simply forgotten how much things have really changed.
 But the most important realization to be derived from these events is of the inherent defect in attempts to address the factors underlying international security in a piece meal manner.
 Over the past five years the Commission encountered reminders of this truth in virtually every field that it took up for examination.
 It is this experience that has convinced us of the need for wider perspectives and total solutions.
 The marvellous achievements of the past few years are neither fortuitous nor illusory.
 The Berlin Wall has been brought down and demolished.
 The Iron Curtain has been lifted and obliterated.
 But we still proceed with our heads turned back, looking for shadows behind us at a time when the future demands our full attention in order to capitalize fully on what these events have prepared and made possible.

Rodregas focused inwards and resumed his meditation.
 He was finding it wonderful to do the meditation again; Rodregas had a lot of good memories from his life as a squire, before everything had gone wrong.
 Part of him felt uncomfortable for doing this again, like he no longer had the right.
 But once you are raised from Page to Squire as he had been, you always got to keep the title of Squire.
 Squires who were not raised to knighthood were much sought after; their martial training and their education, especially in law and etiquette, were a great foundation for many careers.
 As Rodregas knelt on the ground balancing the sword across his arms, and the sun warm on his face, he thought back to that time when he had used his Squire title to get into the officer academy in the Ramig Empire.
 Though giving up his dream of becoming a Knight of the Soaring Heavens had been hard, Rodregas had thought that he would become a successful officer in the army.
 Unfortunately, things had gone far amiss and he had never known success.
 Rodregas shook his head.
 He was focusing on the distant past, not his duty.

I threw the thoughts out of my head and tried to think of something else.
 Like, where this flat plain of flatness ended.
 “Where are we going, anyway?” I asked and stared at the sky.
 It was going to get dark soon.
 He looked up at me through his hair.
 I could see the curved end of his lip, which met he was smiling.
 “Do we ever know, Jazell?” “Good point.” *** Emily couldn't sleep.
 She kept closing her eyes but it didn't seem like a time to sleep.
 She wanted to do something, just to occupy her busy mind.
 She watched a strange creature fly over to her tree and hook itself on a branch near her.

Current projections, made at a time when Eastern Europe was in the depth of its transition crisis, would also prove too conservative if demand were to recover more rapidly in some of these countries.
 Already Russia’s cocoa imports have risen to four times the level in 1991.
 The gap between the availability of food in industrial nations and in developing countries remains large.
 Food supplies per capita for all developing countries, measured in terms of total calories available, are only 72 per cent of the levels in the industrial countries.
 The availability of protein for consumption is 40 per cent lower in developing countries than in industrial nations.
 Viewed from another perspective, this gap represents a huge potential for the growth of agriculture, and through it for more rapid industrialization and job creation in developing countries, with rising exports from industrial nations.
 Rising incomes are accompanied by a diversification in diet which generates greater demand for wheat, meat and dairy products, fish, vegetables, fruits and processed foods.
 Projections for the year 2010 anticipate a 60 per cent increase in cereal consumption in developing countries, a 52 per cent increase in meat consumption, and a 69 per cent increase in milk consumption.
 Meat consumption in China has tripled since 1978 and is expected to more than double again over the next two decades.
 Sugar consumption in developing countries is currently less than half the average of industrial nations.

She shook her head, attention still mostly on the fighting taking place on the far end of the sand court.
 "We're from different bloodlines.
 If you believe the legends, Adjam became the first wolf, and Inock the first of the big cats.
 Alec and the others descended from Adjam, and I'm a descendant of Inock."
 It all seemed so impossible, legends brought to life and paraded before my incredulous eyes, and yet there was no arguing with the truth.
 It was starting to sink in that I needed to come to terms with all of the natural implications.
 Things like the fact that some or all of my attraction to Alec was based on his ability to addict humans to him, intentionally or not.
 James and Jessica were squared off against Alec now while Isaac and Jasmin watched.
 I'd thought everyone else moved fast, but Alec was even faster.
 He actually dodged Jess' jump, causing her to latch onto nothing more than thin air, while he spun around and hit James with a blow to the chest that had to have broken ribs.

I looked to the left and saw a door with a sword on it.
 I sighed and pushed open my door.
 The small room also had glass ceilings but they were dimmer.
 The room was dark and cold, with dust in the air.
 “I was wondering when you would get here,” a familiar voice said.
 I jumped and looked into one of the corners.
 The girl from my dreams walked out, shimmering.
 She smiled and I then noticed the bow hanging on her back with a quiver of arrows.
 “You know how you asked for my name before?
 I can tell you now,” she said.

I glanced around to find a village I didn’t know.
 Someone was coming toward me, an expression of fear and sadness on his handsome face.
 His familiar face.
 He reached out to me and I stepped toward him, tears streaming down my cheeks.
 He wrapped his arms around me as I turned again to see my mother.
 A howl of rage escaped her and I started to go to her, but he held me.
 He was restraining me.
 I thrashed against him as I tried to scream, to tell him to let me go, but I had no voice.
 She reached her hand out and I could not move, could not help her, though I knew she was dying.
 I was imprisoned there, unable to move… unable to scream… unable to save her.

8.Technology transfer: Accelerate transfer of technology to and between developing countries.
 One or more profit-making commercial organizations should be established as a public sector joint venture of developing countries to promote the commercial transfer of technology to, within and between developing countries and to channel the profits from this activity toward research in these countries.
 9.Global employment model: Our efforts to promote employment are constrained by a lack of detailed knowledge of how global labour markets actually work.
 We still do not understand the impact of technology, trade, macro-economic policies, multinational corporations, shifting patterns of foreign investment and many other factors on job creation, and our ignorance severely hampers effective policy formulation and coordination.
 An international research programme should be organized under the ILO to construct a truly global employment model that monitors the impact of technological developments, expanding world trade, plant closings, movement of industry to low-wage countries, agriculture-led industrialization, economic growth, immigration policies, refugee movements and other factors affecting employment opportunities around the world.
 10.Shift focus of technological development: The number of jobs created or destroyed by technology depends on the priority given to various objectives in the process of technological development.
 Presently, there is an in-built bias in technological R & D towards replacing human labour with capital and energy, even when similar levels of quality and efficiency could be achieved by alternative means.
 A conscious shift of focus could lead to the development of more labour-intensive production processes.
 The production of more food to meet the needs of a burgeoning population has been one of the outstanding global achievements of the post-war period.
 It has demonstrated the extraordinary capacity of humankind to meet a collective challenge of monumental proportions.

The only thing you could change to scare her worse would be to join the football team and be the star quarterback."
 His smile was so beautiful it made my heart ache.
 "Well, in that case I'm glad I never tried out for the varsity team.
 I'd hate to make things any more difficult for you."
 Brandon gently captured my arm as we slipped inside the school.
 "Speaking of stars, I happened to read them last night and they told me a secret."
 "Oh, really?
 Do tell, I always love to hear a good secret."
 There was a new twinkle in his eye as he shook his head.
 "Oh, it wasn't a secret from you, just one you hadn't shared with me.

Qurrah stood and bowed before his new master.
 “I will be here,” he said.
 “And I will be ready.”
 “Go.” Velixar waved his hand, and Qurrah obeyed.

 If he had not been so preoccupied, he would have noticed the slight irregularity of the snoring and the exaggerated movements of his brother’s chest.

She went upstairs with him and said goodnight outside her bedroom door.
 But her heart began pounding with panic as she thought about the day she'd just spent in 2011.
 She'd worn trousers in town, and she'd embraced a man in public.
 And now she was spending the night alone with him in his house!
 Davis would have a fit if he ever found out she'd been to a speakeasy; he'd refuse to marry her if he found out what she'd done today.
 But there was no way he could find out.
 Tomorrow she'd be back home, and he'd be ecstatic that she was all right.
 He'd be sorry he'd lost his temper with her and hurt her with his kiss.
 He'd spend more time with her.

Imeralda led the two men over to a corner where a young man lay; he was unconscious and looked near death.
 From his wounds Rodregas guessed he had been injured during the sword and shield competition.
 To Rodregas’ relief no one was paying them any attention, not even to Doi’van.
 Rodregas and Doi’van did their best to block the view of others as Imeralda gathered the limp pale hand that should have belonged to an old man, not a young one, and slipped the small frog figurine into it.
 Quickly she channeled the power.
 Rodregas could feel the instinctive rise of the young man’s own power.
 Then the squire started to squirm weakly in pain.
 Both Doi’van and Rodregas reached out and steadied the young man until it was over.
 Imeralda straightened the sheets for the young squire.
 She then led Rodregas and Doi’van to the figure of a woman.

My own brother Thomas was one of the many drug dealers receiving this merchandise for pennies on the dollar in exchange for cocaine and marijuana.
 This would be one of the many actions that would drive a wedge between Thomas and me as drugs and money started to always come before family.
 It hurt me deeply to contemplate Thomas’s complete disregard for our relationship as brothers and his choice to take this merchandise from my addicted partner while knowing full well that it would financially destroy my business and thus me.
 Pete had already disappeared for several weeks when I discovered what he was doing, but it was too late and the business closed within a month after the invoices for all of these portable spas and waterbeds started arriving.
 The checking account had been completely drained of any operating capital.
 Bad business partner, and bad best friend: My girlfriend at the time, Karen, had hidden her drug habit from me, and by the time I discovered it she had emptied our joint savings account and was screwing my ex-partner/best friend, Pete.
 They were both very addicted to cocaine and I guess they belonged together because neither one of them belonged with me.
 I went to her apartment where I caught them together.
 I beat him within an inch of his life in front of her.
 Karen and her roommate did everything they could to pull me off of him but my rage for his complete abandonment of our friendship in so many ways had escalated to the perfect storm.

He went from cold to hot and back again.
 In a couple of weeks he was looking much healthier and we sent him out into the world again.
 Turns out, just because I did drugs and knew people who were addicted to drugs I was still not qualified to understand how to break someone from craving the drugs that satisfy their addiction.
 Brandon seemed better and we thought we had helped him simply because we incarcerated him at home away from his peers until he had the drugs out of his system.
 In our mind, he was cured.
 Unfortunately, the problem had not been solved so easily.
 Like any good movie, this solution came too easily and too early in the drama.
 He was such a child then, easily influenced and dealing with challenges in counterproductive ways.
 He was caught being truant, being out past curfew, being with a kid who stole a wallet.
 He was involved in multiple car accidents.

Chapter Fifteen Fortress
 My mind regained consciousness very slowly.
 I was hit with blurry images first, sights and scenes that melded into hazy dreams.
 Eventually they became clearer, though they didn’t make much sense.
 After a time it occurred to me the problem was the images were mixing with the wrong sounds… real sounds.
 Panicked sounds.
 I thought I recognized Chevelle’s voice and tried to focus on it, to understand the agony.
 “Frey,” he said, and something brushed my cheek, warm and feather light.
 The distant impression that it might have been the brush of lips had me drawing in a sharp breath, and I coughed, gasping to fill my lungs.
 The air shifted as those surrounding me moved in response.

 That’s what she’s always been saying, but people couldn’t hear her, for whatever reason.
 They wouldn’t listen.
 Just like I say in “Burn my Bridge”, you know?
 “There’s a black and white photograph/On my finger is a tiny bird.”  You know?
 It’s like they can’t hear me now, after they all were so intent on being Black Lung acolytes, or whatever.

I scanned through the first problem, and then picked up my pencil and got started.
 Having successfully finished my test with ten minutes to spare, I expected lunch to bring more of the same kind of anxiety that I'd just managed to push out of my mind.
 It was headed that way.
 Despite Britney's best efforts to distract me with a point-by-point analysis of what was going on with someone named Sandra, and the two boys she'd been leading on for the last month.
 I followed Britney through the lunch line, gripping my meal replacement drink with both hands.
 We sat down at our usual table, only to be surrounded a few seconds later by an energetic mob of familiar-looking people.
 It wasn't until Brandon slid into the seat next to me that I realized who everyone was.
 "We thought maybe we'd come join the two of you today.
 That shabby little corner where we always sit was getting a little old."
 Brandon's voice was smooth and flawless as always, but even that couldn't distract me enough to miss the flash of dislike in Cassie's eyes as she sat down next to Britney.

Together, they stood upon the roof and gazed over the wall, mesmerized by the sight before them.
 Mere seconds away, hundreds and hundreds of orcs charged.
 Their race could see as well in night as in day.
 That same racial ability allowed the two brothers to watch the approaching orcs, lean muscle bulging underneath their sweat-glistened pale gray skin.
 Some wore mismatched armor, though most had only skulls, straps of leather, and war paint covering their bodies.
 Wave after wave of arrows rained upon them, and those who fell were trampled by the rest, but the masses were not even slowed.
 Harruq pointed past the army to where a long line of men stood in the distance, carrying no light or torch.
 “What are they doing?” he asked.
 Qurrah searched the line, and he saw what he suspected.
 “The necromancer,” he observed, pointing to the black shape hidden underneath robes and a hood.

Plus, they're like the two hottest people in the entire school.
 How could they possibly date anyone else?"
 It was hard to argue with that.
 Jasmin was the kind of brunette who disproved the old saying that gentlemen prefer blondes.
 Any guy with a pulse would want her.
 And Alec was like a composite of every gorgeous model ever born.
 I could get past that and see he was a jerk, but that was just because girls seemed to be wired a little different.
 None of it made sense.
 If Jasmin was dating Alec, why was she so mad at Lucy for talking to this Ben boy?
 I hadn't seen any other boys who were even close to as attractive as Alec and Brandon, and Jasmin didn't seem like the type to pick substance over form.

Population: In spite of the continued decline in birth rates, world population is expected to rise by nearly three billion people or 50 per cent over the next three decades, making the task of achieving food security, employment and education for all even more daunting than it is today.
 Poverty: The incidence of poverty continues to increase both in relative and absolute terms.
 Presently, 1.4 billion people, constituting 26 per cent of the total population of developing and developed nations, live in poverty.
 The poorest 20 per cent of the world’s population share a minuscule 1.4 per cent of the world’s income.
 According to current projections, 300 million people, representing nearly 50 per cent of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, will live below the poverty line at the turn of the century.
 Environment: Unsustainable lifestyles and consumption (in industrial countries) and population growth, along with rising levels of production and consumption (in developing countries), will place strenuous demands on the environment of the planet.
 Growing damage to the basic life support systems of soil, water, flora, fauna and the atmosphere is taking place in all parts of the world.
 Unemployment: In the West, rising levels of unemployment have increased resistance to free trade and immigration.
 Rising levels of long-term unemployment and youth unemployment in inner cities are associated with the increasing incidence of crime.
 In developing countries, rapid population growth continues to outpace job creation in most regions, resulting in high levels of unemployment, increasing social unrest and large scale migration from rural to urban areas and internationally.

He dug it out of the bottom drawer of his desk and read it again.
 All it contained was her birth date and the general information about her family.
 He wished the information about her marriage to Davis hadn’t disappeared.
 He could have shown her what her life would be like if she married him.
 But why couldn’t he just tell her what the article had said originally?
 She could draw her own conclusions about what the change in the article meant.
 Excited, he stood and headed for her room.
 But when he reached her door, he hesitated.
 Would she believe him about the article?
 She still felt loyal to that jerk, and she might not believe him.

She turned and threw her arms around him.
 She was in a party scene, one of six people that formed a group with the star.
 She wasn't supposed to do anything but smile and sip her drink, but when the star gave her a smoldering glance during rehearsal, the director decided he wanted to film it.
 The result was a split-second close-up of her face, and the star kissed her hand.
 Marie felt as if she were going to burst from excitement.
 They were allowed to watch filming until lunch, and then they were given a tour of the rest of the studio.
 Marie heard obscenities and shouting, and she saw two different actors storm off two different sets in the middle of their scenes.
 But it was wonderful.
 The actors and actresses were very attractive people, and many of them were nice to her.
 "Today was magic, absolute magic," Marie sighed as they ate steak and salad that evening.

He flung the potion back to Aurelia’s mouth, nearly shredding her lower lip on the broken glass.
 More of the silvery-blue liquid poured down her throat.

 The seconds crawled slower than the longest of years.
 He didn’t care if anyone came and saw him, not even his brother.
 His tears fell onto her bloodstained dress.
 For far too long, she did not move.
 His heart cried out in agony.
 It was too late.
 He had killed her.

Neither said a word as he discarded his armor, tossed his swords into a corner, and crashed onto their bed of straw.
 For a long moment, only the sound of Harruq’s heavy breathing filled the room.

 Harruq didn’t bother to answer.

The elf dropped to one knee, words of magic streaming out her mouth as fast as she could speak them.
 Her magical shield could halt attacks of pure magical essence, such as the conjured fire, but animated objects were a different matter.
 The magic projecting them would die at her shield but the pieces would retain their momentum.
 The dirt before her rumbled, cracked, and then ascended in a great physical wall.
 On the other side, pieces of bone thumped against it, one after another.
 “Cute,” Velixar said, “but pointless.”
 An invisible blast of pure force shattered the wall.
 Aurelia crossed her arms before her face as chunks of earth slammed into her slender form.
 She rolled with the blows, her mouth casting before she halted.
 Ice spread from house to house, walling Velixar off on the other side.

She jumped when she heard Rick's door open.
 Glancing at him, she turned and headed downstairs.
 Rick followed her, wondering if she was mad or embarrassed or confused.
 Most women would never again speak to a man who had rejected her touch.
 But most women would have known exactly what they were doing.
 Marie had simply been yielding to the pleasure of his kisses and touches with no intention of giving up her virginity.
 He'd never known a woman so passionate.
 When they walked out into the garden, Marie headed for the fog without a backward glance.
 Rick grabbed her hand.
 "Marie, wait."

Another defining moment for all of us.
 We hope and pray that Brandon will use the tools he has been taught to navigate through this world where drugs and alcohol are abundant and easy to obtain where ever you live and no matter who you are with.
 Brandon needs to have the strength and desire to embrace his new healthy body and see the ramifications of destroying himself and his family if he chooses to return to drugs.
 About the Author Bradley V. DeHaven is a Financial Planner in Sacramento, California, a husband, and a father of two sons, one of whom is a recovering Oxycontin addict.
 Brad is pictured here with Brandon in January 2011; Brandon, age 25, is 55 pounds heavier than the 130 pounds his 6’2” body weighed when he entered rehab.
 Brandon still fights the demons that call to him in his darkest moments.
 Prescription drug abuse is an epidemic which claims the lives of our youth.
 photo by Devin DeHaven, 2011
 I hope that this book and the website http://www.rxdrugaddict.comcan help addicts better understand that they are not just destroying themselves but also their family and friends.
 I hope they can see that they could have long and productive lives if they chose to feel life instead of numbing it.

She held out the ring.
 He ignored it.
 "You're just confused because of what happened to you.
 What did happen to you, by the way?"
 "I came to my senses.
 Take your ring, Davis."
 "Listen, Marie, you don't know what you're saying.
 We can push the date back a bit, get married in October instead of September."
 "What part of `I don't want to marry you' do you not understand?"
 She grinned, because he was obviously taken aback.

The only problem was that the three could not practice freely as the arrows sometimes shattered on impact, as they flew with such force.
 Doi’van quickly mastered the spell and the use of the bow.
 Rodregas, on the other hand, struggled to learn the artistry of the spell.
 One afternoon, a few days after Doi’van had mastered the spell, Rodregas stood there with the bow trying hard to both find the rhythm of the spell and shoot the weapon.
 Imeralda stood next to him, her hand lightly touching the bow as she tried to figure out why he was still struggling with the mastery of the weapon.
 Rodregas reached down into himself, to that place that held his magic.
 Though Rodregas had never had much power, he had always enjoyed using his “itch” (as he had always called it) to do small things.
 Using his magic now was a very different experience.
 Whereas before it had been calming, requiring him to call forth his little bit of power, now he held a whirling tornado of energy.
 It was not a matter of having enough; it was a matter of having almost too much power that overwhelmed the simple spell.

Britney apparently agreed, and she wasted no time in letting me know what it was.
 "There are two in-crowds here; Brandon's group, which consists of all of the athletes and cheerleaders, and Alec's group, which is about half the size, and outside of his immediate friends is made up of a few geeks and misfits.
 You were on the border of getting in with Brandon, but just threw all of that away to save Alec's little sister when he's too much of a coward to do it himself."
 I wanted to protest, to explain why everyone should be able to get along, or point out that despite Brandon's obvious appeal, it was his friend who was wrong, but Britney had already turned and stalked off.
 I probably would've spent the next few minutes refining my arguments for the next time we talked, but the last thing Britney had said finally sank in.
 His sister.
 Rachel was Alec's sister, and he hadn't made a move to save her.
 He hadn't even been willing to let his friends step in and stop the fight.
 I drifted off to History thinking that I would've done almost anything to save my sister.
 It would take a real heartless individual to abandon their own family.

“Jazell, you’ll aim for the belly while we hold it off.
 If you can’t get an arrow in before I can cut off the stinger, then I’ll have to do it myself.” “Fine boss dude,” I said with a snort.
 Seth ducked and charged the creature, his sword held out behind him.
 Jason flicked some knives into his wrist and flung them at the creature.
 Some hit their mark, which was signaled by the creature roaring out in pain, others fell into the dirt.
 Emily danced close to it, spinning fire from her fingertips.
 The creature raised a leg and swatted at her but she just twirled away.
 The stinger narrowly missed Seth, and I saw him stumble back in surprise.
 He swung his sword at the stinger.
 It sliced through and the creature screeched so loud I was afraid everyone would hear it.

The elf dropped low, his right leg stretching back as he crouched.
 The bone fragments flew over his head, faster than arrows.
 Then he was up, his bow in hand.
 The string vanished from the bow, spikes pierced the front, and out came the long blades at each side.
 “You foolish mortal,” Velixar said.
 His voice was far deeper than before, less like a man and more like a demon.
 “I do not fear your steel.”
 Pale hands shot upward, hooked in strange formations.
 Dieredon stabbed a long blade straight at the man’s throat.
 The blade halted halfway there, crashing against an invisible barrier.

“I mean they are our friends, best buds, you get my drift.
 I understand that you're scared and worried but so am I. I'm scared that if I'm the only one who knows about this, I won't be enough to help you.” “Jazell, I understand now.
 I'm sorry I was such a jerk, I should have listened to you.” I turned back around to see Seth's eyes watching me.
 He was clutching his head and groaning.
 I gave him a hand and he grabbed it.
 I helped him sit up and handed him his sword.
 He laid it across his lap and looked at the ground.
 “I'm glad that you're okay and that you've finally through your stubbornness,” I said and gave him a small smile.
 “I just don't know what to tell them.” “Well, tell them everything,” I said.
 “Start in the beginning and don't hold anything back.

He turned around and studied it.
 Then there was a horrible sound, like ripping metal.
 The belly of the creature seemed to open up and winds picked up.
 Seth threw down his sword as the wind sucked at him.
 He tried to keep himself from being pulled in.
 I ran up to him with Emily and Jason right behind me.
 The winds were so powerful I started to slide toward the body, before I was even close enough.
 Seth’s knuckles were white in the effort to hold himself down.
 “Get back,” he ordered.
 “Get back or we’ll all-” He didn’t get to finish his sentence because his sword came loose and we all we’re sucked into the black void of the creature.

Both swords stabbed high above her head.
 A quick turn and one end of her staff rammed the half-orc in the gut.
 The blow knocked the wind out of Harruq.
 “For what reason do we fight?” she asked.
 “For what reason do you harbor this hatred?”
 He glared.
 “I told you.
 I’m fighting elves.
 You’re one of them.
 No simpler than that.”

The dice had been rolled.
 Rodregas had been learning to trust Doi’van and knew his life was now in Doi’van hands.
 If Imeralda had missed something critical and they should not attack, it was for Doi’van to catch.
 Rodregas watched Doi’van, watched for him to raise the bow and start the fight.
 When the guards charged in to stop the shooting, then it would be his turn to strike.
 Rodregas would have to take on as many of the slavers and guards as possible.
 It would do little good to get caught up in a one-on-one battle; the odds were too many against them.
 He had to use his new strength and speed and go after multiple targets.
 Rodregas focused on his breathing, he needed his body ready.
 He rested his body against the tree, trying not to tense up, and breathed deep and slow.

I shot Alec another dirty look, but it slid right off the armor of his arrogance.
 He nodded to Mrs. Alexander, and then slipped out of the classroom.
 "Run along, young lady, we wouldn't want you to be late for your next class."
 Spanish went about like I'd expected.
 There was a brief discussion on a new grammar concept, some vocabulary, and a whole lot of television.
 Britney caught up with me at my locker, still complaining that she was going to have to start doing her homework instead of trying to flirt with football players.
 "It's completely unfair.
 Nobody else's parents get called.
 It's like I'm back in grade school and have to deal with parent-teacher conference every month.
 I thought the whole point of high school was to give us the chance to start making some of our own decisions."

I could hear a plane start up in the background by the time she finally responded.
 "Okay, honey.
 If you're sure, then we'll do it, but if anything comes up just call me.
 I'll keep my cell phone with me all the time, and I made them promise to fly me back no questions asked if it became necessary."
 I stifled a laugh at the idea of Mom making a twelve-hour flight back to the US because I stubbed my toe, and instead tried to interject even more sincerity into my voice.
 "I'll be fine, Mom.
 I even promise to stay out of trouble.
 Have a safe flight."
 I stared at the cell phone for several seconds before looking up at Alec, who was just putting a cell phone that could have been the twin to the one I was holding away.
 "You redirected our calls?"

The house to her left didn't look like any house she'd ever seen before yesterday.
 And she was no longer in a garden--she was walking across a lawn.
 She wanted to keep walking, but with the fog disappearing and no garden in sight, she was afraid it was useless.
 She turned around, eyes down as she headed back to Rick's house.
 How would she get back?
 Was she stuck here?
 Her parents must be out of their minds with fear.
 And Davis--he was probably tearing the city apart looking for her.
 Or would after he'd finished work for the day.
 Now where had that uncharitable thought come from?

"It's very pretty.
 But how could it not be, with you wearing it."
 She blushed, pleased with his compliment.
 Deciding that the dress would be perfect with the scarab-shaped gold and turquoise choker Davis had given her for her birthday, she went to try on two other dresses.
 But now she liked the Egyptian pattern so much that the others didn't appeal to her.
 Maybe she could find a similar motif in a different color at another shop.
 Changing back into her own dress and straightening the seams on her stockings, she emerged with the blue lotus on her arm.
 "I'd like this, please," she told the saleslady, reaching into her purse.
 "I'll buy it for you, darling."
 Davis took out his wallet.

But it was getting harder and harder to remember why she'd fallen in love with him.
 He didn't spend much time with her, didn't hold her very often, didn't do anything really fun.
 And he wasn't nearly as handsome as Rick.
 Rick had beautiful blue eyes and-and a broad, muscular chest that she got to see every morning if she woke up before he did.
 In her dreams, he never had on a shirt, and he was always smiling.
 That dream might change now.
 Right now the image in her mind was of his face as it had come closer and closer to hers.
 She'd wanted him to kiss her.
 But she was going to marry Davis--she couldn't kiss another man!
 "Are you hungry, honey?"

And we went at it, you know, it was a real relationship, even that young.
 Hell, we were kids.
 But, when I wasn’t writing, playing, I was with her—let’s call her Debbie because every girl back then was named Debbie—in front of her house, practicing our manumission, handjobs and fingerings and oral sex.
 In the car, on the front porch, in the backyard.
 Hell, still, that was some of the best sex I ever had—Lor understands, don’t sweat that, man—but, you know, that first flush of what you, at least at the time, call love, and access to another person’s body, the most personal parts of their body—what a joy!
 What undiluted joy!
 So, we went at it, like I say, like a couple of hamsters in heat.
 That was freshman year.
 That was while I was starting to play everywhere around town—I was like almost famous, you know.
 Locally.

Marie decided she’d ask Grace to make her a waffle this morning.
 She’d like cherries and whipped cream on it.
 She’d go shopping with her mother and maybe have lunch in town.
 After lunch she’d come home to take a nap.
 The house would be hot in the afternoon.
 “Don’t forget to pick up the dry cleaning!” Marie jumped, looking up to see who’d yelled.
 A car door slammed, and she saw a sleek gray car back out of a driveway.
 She’d wandered far from Rick’s house .

While most of the prescriptions listed above are known to all, very few are systematically and efficiently applied.
 Africa can benefit enormously by applying strategies that have worked in Asia.
 The ‘Prosperity 2000’ programme evolved by ICPF for India and presented in the next chapter seeks to utilize a combination of these strategies to generate 100 million new jobs within a decade or less, which will be sufficient to raise 25 per cent of the world’s poorest billion people above the poverty line.
 Given a comprehensive approach, the right mix of policies, good government and a conducive international environment for trade, technology transfer and investment, every nation has the capacity to develop and meet the employment needs of its people within the next one or two decades.
 The Right to Employment
 The transformation of social life in this century has drawn hundreds of millions of people away from a subsistence level existence in agriculture to urban areas and industrial employment.
 In the process it has brought about an unprecedented advancement in living standards around the world.
 But it has also engendered a way of life in which the livelihood of individuals is far more dependent than in the past on external conditions – the state of the national and global economy, trade policies, interest and exchange rates, levels of military spending and overall consumer demand.
 Modern society, even in the most liberal democracies, has become so structured that it leaves less and less freedom for truly independent individual initiative.
 Today, government intervenes in virtually every aspect of society’s economic existence, restricting the freedom of the individual to seek his or her own livelihood and determining the type and number of job opportunities available.

She couldn't believe she was going home!
 She'd spend all day tomorrow talking to her mother, and her father would probably come home from work at a reasonable hour.
 And she’d get Tom to take her to see her brother this weekend.
 She didn't know how she was going to explain her disappearance.
 She couldn't very well tell them she'd gone 84 years into the future--they'd think she'd lost her mind.
 Maybe she could pretend to have amnesia.
 No--she was going to tell her mother all about Rick.
 She knew that she wouldn't be able to keep quiet about him even if she wanted to.
 Rick joined her in the kitchen.
 "How about this one?"

"No.
 I'm not upset."
 They went to the grocery store that evening and bought ingredients for the next day's dinner.
 Rick had called his sister, and she'd been thrilled Rick had a girl he wanted her to meet and mad that he hadn't invited her sooner.
 If Marie was going to make dinner at his house, they'd obviously been dating long enough to feel pretty comfortable together.
 "I shouldn't have made garlic bread.
 All evening my breath will smell like garlic," Marie told Rick as she finished making dinner the next evening.
 "So will everyone else's."
 "Are you sure Teri likes garlic?"
 "She loves it."

It was not his turn to answer any question other than from the Grand Marshal.
 The Marshal Faurrenida voice made his displeasure and his dislike of arguing with a non-knight clear as he said, “While a knight has the full right to enter both the Lesser and Greater Sigil Chambers and take and sigil as his level of magic might allow, it is not a sigil he earns today.
 It is knighthood.
 Now, the discussion is over.” growled Marshal Faurrenida.
 To forestall any further argument, the Grand Marshal stepped forward quickly and drew his sword.
 The sword gleamed of the highest quality blue steel and red fire seemed to run its length.
 Marshal Faurrenida laid the sword on Rodregas’ right shoulder and said, “Squire, you come to us this day.
 Think well and be sure on your decision to swear these oaths.” Faurrenida paused for a second and then slowly added.
 “Will you swear to uphold the Rules of Chivalry, to serve the Order of the Soaring Heavens with honor, and to serve as the Champion of the Celestials on this World if called to be a Paladin?” “My Lord Grand Marshal, I so swear in the name of the Celestial Gods.” Strangely, instead of being excited, he felt tired.
 In some ways he was adding another burden and it was heavy.

My dreams were vivid.
 Crimson curls brushing my cheek and bouncing as a slender fairy danced across the floor, flitting her painted fingers.
 Stone houses in the night, the glare of fire glinting off the rock.
 Massive stones rising high above.
 Dark leather, tight against my skin.
 Cloaks flowing in the wind, forming a circle and then massing together, threatening.
 Black hair glistening with sweat in the moonlight and rolling in rhythm as the horse ran, its mane rocking hypnotically with the motion.
 Its heavy equine smell, so unlike any other.
 I clung to Chevelle’s strong back as we rode at full speed.
 The wind and rain cut at my face, my eyes sore, cheeks streaked with tears and ash.

Rodregas had a feeling that Doi’van lacked much of a sense of humor.
 The other three men simply shook their heads at his idiotic statement.
 Not that his statement did not have a hint of truth to it.
 Rodregas was sure everyone here had lost a loved one, at some point, to an Immortalist.
 But, no Paladin of the Gods had ever come to their rescue.
 The truth was that even if one of the gods was backing Rodregas, it was more likely to be some god who was pissed off at the Immortalists; one looking for a chosen champion for their own selfish reasons.
 As a child Rodregas had dreamed of being such a champion, but Paladin’s were always chosen from the ranks of the Order of the Soaring Heavens, and while Rodregas had once served the Order as a squire he had never came close to achieving knighthood.
 “All right, Sir Paladin, I have to admit I have talked to the Sorcerer Ravenhurr a few too many times, and you definitely don’t seem to be him.
 Nevertheless, we are taking your wagon and your supplies.
 We will let you go in peace in the morning,” said Audrian in that tone of voice that implied that he just expected people to follow his orders.

A group of knights stood tall next to the doors, but their heads tracked the presence of Rodregas and his two companions.
 Rodregas vaguely remembered one as Gorin, an older man who under more prosperous times for the knighthood would now be enjoying his retirement.
 “Gorin!” Rodregas yelled boastfully, “Open the doors, the Grand Marshal says that I may review the choice I must make.” Rodregas walked over and slapped the knight in the arm, laying it on heavy.
 Luckily, his success on the field had him in a good mood.
 Rodregas waved at the heavy doors as if wiggling his fingers could open them.
 “Sir Rodregas, you look good for having just completed the tournament this day,” said Gorin.
 “I would not expect you to be moving around much yet.” Rodregas nodded.
 He could not explain that he already had a minor sigil of healing.
 He simply smiled and said, “I am too excited to lie down and groan in pain!
 My mind races with the possibilities.

 Look what it did to Dylan.
 He didn’t want to finish Tarantula, but, there was so much pressure on him and then someone circulated bootleg versions and the whole thing became uncontrollable.
 I can’t have that.

Character 2- There…There’s nobody out there dear.
 This is your living room.
 Character 1- Well of course there’s people there, they’re right there (points at the audience) I’ve been doing this for well over two hours strait, and they’ve been enjoying it and tipping quite well might I add (Indicates a up-side down hat, with a tips sign, on the floor at the edge of the stage).
 Character 2- (walks over to the hat and picks it up, and turns it over) There’s no money here, its empty.
 Maybe ‘they’ haven’t enjoyed it as much as you thought they were.
 Character 1- (to the audience) You ungrateful swine, I poor myself out up here on stage for you and this is all I get?
 Nothing!
 I was lying when I said that you were a great group, you’re really a buncha idiots who couldn’t tell what humor was if it came up and bit them in the ass…
 Character 2- (gently grabs character 1 and turns him to face her) Have you been taking your medicine lately?
 The doctor said that you had to take the pills every day.

Harruq nodded, shivering as he felt the tip of the blade rubbing against the tender skin of his throat.
 “Good.
 Pleasant days, half-orc.
 May Celestia watch over you…‌and condemn your actions to death.”
 The biting tip left his throat, the blades in the bow retracted, and then the elf vanished.
 Harruq struggled to his feet, clutching his neck as he gasped for air.
 “Damn elf,” he cursed.
 “How dare you threaten us.”
 His hands shook violently as his adrenaline faded.
 He had been terrified, convinced the elf would kill him, yet he didn’t.

I tried to lose myself in the book, but the same worries that'd pestered me while I was trying to study continued to grate against the back of my mind.
 I hadn't wanted to come here, but I'd tried to make it work.
 Mom keeping the pendant felt like a complete betrayal.
 She'd known how it would impact me, but hadn't cared.
 I finally gave up on trying to immerse myself in nineteenth-century France, and cried myself to sleep.
 ** It was all I could do to drag myself out of bed Monday morning.
 A part of me knew this was all stupid, but I couldn't shake the depression.
 I was just aware enough to register Brandon's concerned glances as he drove me into school.
 Mrs. Sorenson shot me a nasty look as I stumbled into class.
 "Well isn't it nice of you to come to class today.

"Don't you remember what we talked about?
 About how-how passionate kissing can lead to lovemaking?"
 "But Rick, can't we kiss at all?"
 He raised her hand to nibble on one delicate fingertip, trying to resist the nearly irresistible impulses that the frustrated desire in her eyes and voice stirred in him.
 "Not like we were tonight.
 Don't you understand, Marie?
 When our kisses get that hot, it's hard for me to stop.
 I don't want to stop.
 I want to make love to you."
 Her face grew fiery, and she was silent for a few seconds, staring down at her hands.

Women and children, all of them panicked and confused.
 “Harruq, they flee west,” Qurrah whispered, magically enhancing his voice using a spell Velixar had taught him.
 His quiet words flooded the town, audible by all yet still sounding like a whisper.
 The fleeing residents of the town heard and were terrified.
 His brother heard and obeyed.
 The two met at the edge of town.
 They saw scattered groups of families not far in the distance.
 “Get them, my brother,” Qurrah ordered.
 “None may live or they will tell of the half-orcs who destroyed their town.”
 “Then they’re dead,” Harruq said, clanging his swords together.

Do not be so selfish as to want it all to yourself.” With that he gave a punch to Rodregas’ side, causing Rodregas to grunt in pain, and Doi’van followed the other two out the door.
 Rodregas laid in the bed, his mind whirling with thoughts.
 At first he thought about the implications of what Jordaan had shared.
 But, then his mind went back again and again over his and Imeralda’s time during the last few weeks and then back to Doi’van’s words.
 He knew his friend spoke the truth, but he was not so sure about his ability to do what he needed to keep his relationship with the beautiful AElven Nymph.
 CHAPTER 11 THE NATURE OF BONDS
 The next few days Rodregas and Doi’van recovered quickly under the powerful healing magic of Jordaan.
 This is not to say Rodregas did not spend most of his time dreaming that the handsome young Nymph would head back to his own estates.
 They were staying in a small village that seemed to be mostly a forest with small rooms built into it.
 Rodregas could not figure out any set pattern to the place or its boundaries.

Movement up the mountain caught my eye and I looked to Chevelle in alarm.
 Though he appeared calm, he was staring in the same direction.
 A dark cloaked figure advanced in the dusk, the full cape covering every part of its owner, drawn hood shielding their face.
 Chevelle nodded in greeting as I scanned the area for others who might approach.
 The stranger seemed alone, and reached Chevelle first, since he stood nearer to the horses than me.
 The newcomer whispered to him, and Chevelle’s eyes flicked my direction more than once.
 Curiosity burned through me.
 And then a delicate hand reached out to pass Chevelle a package.
 Her fingers lingered against his during the exchange and my chest felt like it was blistering inside.
 They were whispering about me.

Thank you.
 Art – (turns to leave and search for Jim) Any time for a pretty young woman.
 Karen – Do you work for Elizabeth Struan?
 Art – No, I don’t even work at this gallery.
 I repair electrical appliances and the like.
 A simple television repairman am I.
 Karen – Are you one of her fan’s then?
 Art – I never really thought about that.
 I enjoy most of her work when I see it, but I’m not really interested in art or artists.
 I guess I’m one of her fans though.

“He was an elf,” he said.
 “I guess it is possible he was our father, although I feel it more likely a coincidence.
 Our mother was intelligent, at least for an orc, but was she smart enough to leave us clues within our own names?”
 “Well, he’s dead now, so we’ll never know,” Harruq said, tossing the blade onto the floor.
 Qurrah, however, was far from dismayed.
 He grinned at his brother and then spoke in his hissing voice.
 “Would you like to have a conversation with our dear old dad?” he asked.

“Show me the power I have sought for so very long.”
 Velixar looked down at his thin, ragged apprentice.
 “Rise.
 Let us begin.”
 Velixar taught until the stars retreated from the obnoxious sun.
 Qurrah returned home, his eyes sagging and his mind exhausted.
 When he climbed into bed, he fell asleep instantly.
 Not long after, Harruq rose, took his swords, and left for his own meeting.

 Greg:  I must be going crazy.
 Cindy:  Really?
 Have you ever met him?

“If the humans win, the elves will declare full scale war against the kingdom of Neldar.
 So which side do you think will have the privilege of our blades and magic?”
 “We will kill the elves,” Harruq said.
 The man in black nodded and then dismissed his bone general.
 “Go.
 Patch your wounds.”
 The half-orc bowed and then joined his brother.
 The two journeyed across the hills and then snuck inside Woodhaven.
 When they reached their home, Harruq removed his armor and began wrapping strips of old cloth around his wounds.
 Qurrah watched him for a moment before speaking.

I saw distrust flash in his eyes but he gave me a weak smile.
 We turned to face the monsters heading for us.
 Seth charged ahead, slicing Thrashers and Frost Beasts.
 I notched an arrow and released it.
 It soared into a swamp toll's head, making it shout out in agony.
 Seth spun around and plunged his sword into the troll's side.
 It gave a screech and fell to the floor, dead.
 Emily raised her hands and vines shot from the ground and wrapped around a troll that had tried to crush Seth.
 I aimed an arrow at its chest and the troll fell to the ground next to the others.
 The last beast fell, dead from Jason's knife, and we all took in a deep breath.

The tingle of Alec's power lessened slightly once we were out of sight, but it still hadn't dropped off completely by the time we were standing in front of Mrs. Tiggs' classroom.
 I could still feel the faintest traces of his power long after he'd finally let my hand go with obvious reluctance and strode off, leaving Dominic and I to find our seats.
 ** The pack was more subdued than normal on the way home.
 Everyone splintered off into smaller component parts as soon as we passed the wrought-iron gate signaling the entrance to the Graves estate.
 Donovan was waiting patiently inside the door, but he took one look at the bristling bundle of energy that was Alec, and obviously revised his plans on the spot.
 "Shall I have dinner delayed, Master Alec, Mistress Rachel?"
 "I'll take mine later, Donovan, but please don't let that inconvenience the rest of the household.
 I'll be out in the garden if anyone needs me."
 Alec took a pair of quick steps down the hall, and then turned back and looked at me.
 "Would you care to join me, Adriana?"

Gathering her closer, he kissed her gently.
 Marie's pulse raced as Rick's lips moved over hers.
 This .

 this was nothing like Davis's kisses.
 Rick's kiss was making her tremble.
 She returned it briefly and then pulled away, hiding her face against his shoulder in confusion.
 How could she like Rick's kiss more than Davis'?
 How could his kiss make her feel so hot and weak?

 Something like that.” “Probably tequila,” he said.
 “Maybe.” But it wasn’t.

 The Real World
 I started college and rented an apartment with Kenny Niedermeyer who was suffering more than any of us over Eric’s death, since the car was his and Sylvia blamed him.
 She would call and scream “Murderer!” and accuse him of stealing the twenty dollars Eric took with him that day.
 Here's something she wrote and sent him: Jingle for Rope Jumpers Teddy Bear, Teddy Bear, Eric's dead.
 They pushed him, and they beat him and they smashed him in the head.
 He gurgled and he growled, he suffered and he bled.

But I was wrong.
 He told a friend of ours many months ago that I had made him happier than he'd ever been.
 "I know how hard it was between you.
 Perhaps when two complex people can't live with each other, it's because they need each other so much they hit head on.
 "I have been thinking how important it was for Eric to be free.
 God didn't make him for this world.
 God made Eric for a world someplace farther beyond our imaginations than any of us can comprehend.
 Someplace where he could run with the wind all day."
 Our friend Kenny Neidermeyer's mom was a Spanish teacher who also volunteered with a Tijuana charity.
 Since June, four of us had been riding with her to Tijuana every Sunday to play a double-header for a ball team the charity sponsored.

 Liz – That’s barely passing.
 Jim – But it is a passing grade.
 Liz – Why did you even bother to take the class if you weren’t going to attempt to try and do well in it?
 Jim – Well, I needed four more credits to be considered full time, and Mayan art fit into my schedule pretty well, so I took it.
 Liz – Did you learn anything at least?
 Jim – Yeah, I don’t really like Mayan art.

Chevelle stood just in front of me.
 He dropped to his knees and reached out to touch the mark across my cheek.
 Shame flooded me, and I turned my head to hide the evidence, but his hand cradled the side of my face.
 Chapter Four Flame
 “Freya,” he repeated in a softer voice as he lifted my chin.
 He appeared to have real concern as he glanced from what I was sure was now a welt to my eyes, and I struggled to keep the tears that were welling up from falling.
 I’d not had a caring touch from anyone for so long I didn’t know how to react.
 And I was ashamed.
 Fannie had authority over me, but I wasn’t a child.
 It was only that I had nowhere else to go.

"You like being kissed on the neck too, don't you?"
 she whispered into his ear.
 "I like it anywhere you kiss me."
 She pressed kisses along his neck and then across his jaw, finally reaching his mouth.
 Their kiss was slow and sweet, and Marie sighed into his mouth.
 "It's so nice," she murmured.
 "What?"
 He tangled his fingers in her hair as he bent to kiss her neck.
 "Being able to kiss the man I love whenever I want instead of having to wait for him to kiss me."
 "You can kiss me any time, anywhere you want."

A feint, so quick Harruq blocked on instinct, took care of the other.
 His weapons gone, the half-orc was exposed.
 Dieredon wasted no time smashing the half-orc’s groin.
 As he doubled over in pain, a snap kick smacked his chin, splattering blood and forcing him to drop.
 The sharp tip of a blade pressed against Harruq’s throat before he knew what was happening.
 “Move,” Dieredon said.
 “Please, move.
 Give me an excuse to kill you.”
 Harruq was too stunned and disoriented to give him what he wanted.
 Instead he lied there, his nose throbbing and his swords limp in his hands.

 “I don’t want to be rude, but do you need to tell me anything else?
 I have to try to come up with a few explanations for back home.” A lot of explanations.
 June walked towards me until she was standing right in front.
 I could almost see through her body, which was really starting to freak me out.
 “You have to get back Seth,” she whispered.
 “I know David was supposed to see him right now and I know he’s disappointed.
 You can’t beat Kojas without the four of you.

For both these reasons, it cannot constitute a reliable mechanism for guaranteeing the security of UN member countries.
 Although a strengthening of the UN’s peace-keeping capabilities is highly desirable, it cannot serve as an adequate foundation for a cooperative security system unless the UN’s political structure is radically modified.
 Because it is essentially an addition to national forces rather than a substitute for them, funding will be a perennial difficulty and there will be strong resistance to its expansion on economic grounds.
 Furthermore, as recent events have demonstrated, nations contributing their forces will have a strong propensity to resist their active deployment in situations that involve significant risks.
 Even after the Security Council decided to send a peace-keeping force into Rwanda for strictly humanitarian purposes, none of the leading military powers, with the exception of France, were willing to contribute the modest amount of military equipment urgently needed to protect UN troops.
 Similar efforts are in various stages of maturity for establishing standing international forces at the regional level in Western Europe, Latin America and other places as part of collective security arrangements.
 The limitation of these proposals, like that of NATO and the erstwhile Warsaw Pact, is that they are fundamentally exclusive in nature and could easily become competitive with other forces as the East and West blocs have in the past.
 The strong resentment voiced by Russia at the proposal that some Eastern European nations would join NATO illustrates the danger of expanding exclusive military clubs.
 For NATO to overcome these legitimate concerns, it would have to be thrown open to all nations that seek to join and abide by its charter.
 The great reluctance of the West to shoulder the burden of responsibility for security enforcement in Eastern Europe under a widened NATO umbrella highlights the basic inadequacy of exclusive blocs for meeting global security needs.

“Well what?” He looked up, his face blank and his eyes wide as if he hadn’t a clue.
 “Why am I not a lady?” Aurelia asked.
 “I don’t know,” Harruq said.
 “Did you cast a spell on yourself or something?
 Look like one to me.”
 She stood and took up her staff.
 Instead of grabbing his swords, Harruq ducked behind a tree.
 “Don’t hurt me,” he shouted.
 His face poked around the tree, his long brown hair falling down past his eyes.
 Much as she tried not to, Aurelia burst into laughter.

 She'd just gotten turned around.
 Listening carefully, she could detect the sound of splashing water.

 “Do we ever know, Jazell?” “Good point.” *** Emily couldn't sleep.
 She kept closing her eyes but it didn't seem like a time to sleep.
 She wanted to do something, just to occupy her busy mind.
 She watched a strange creature fly over to her tree and hook itself on a branch near her.
 It looked like a butterfly with only one set of wings, which were transparent and seemed to glow.
 It had a tail and curled around the branch so it could rest its middle.

This makes them powerful warriors, but also limits their magic to the one or two sigil abilities.
 We need some sort of counter to this advantage.
 If we practice our magic every day, we should make a little progress even without any teachers or books.” She finished with an upturned eyebrow.
 She seemed to think that Rodregas was going to challenge her statement, and argue that they should just focus on the martial training.
 However, Rodregas had been a squire of the Order of the Soaring Heavens, one of the few orders that required magical learning of all its members and one of the few groups that knew the secrets of Sigil Searing, the permanent inscription of sigils onto one’s magic.
 Unfortunately, the secret of sigil magic was given only to those who made knighthood.
 Still, one had to learn enough magic to make the inscribing possible and that early training he had.
 “I totally agree,” Rodregas said.
 “I know only what is taught a squire of our Order, but that I am happy to share.
 Hopefully, we can learn the basics from each other.

"This isn't the time; we need to get you back home to your mom.
 It would be most unfortunate if she were to arrive and find you gone."
 My mind was still a little fuzzy, but it was working well enough for me to know he was wrong.
 "No.
 She's not going to be home until Sunday.
 There isn't any reason to go back there yet."
 I looked around for Rachel, but she'd disappeared sometime between when I'd started falling, and when I'd thought to thank her.
 "You mean she wasn't planning on coming back until Sunday.
 Once Brandon gets involved in things, they tend not to go as expected."
 I wanted to ask questions, but Rachel appeared from a hallway.

“It is as I feared,” he whispered to the night.
 He stood, took his bow off his shoulder, and then thoroughly searched the town.
 He found no trace of life barring a few rats that fed off the now unguarded remnants of food.
 Several homes, those with their doors smashed open, had gore smeared on their floors.
 One pained Dieredon’s heart greatly; amid a great red circle on a wooden floor laid a small, bloodstained doll.
 He said a silent prayer before moving on.
 At the edge of the town, he found many frantic tracks fleeing west.
 He followed them, wincing as some ended in dried smears of red upon the grass.
 Others led far past the others.
 They ended at once in an enormous pool of blood, leaving the town a somber image in the distance.

Condemnation shattered what remained of the table.
 The elf rolled, his arms tucked against his chest.
 When he pulled out of the roll, he dashed for a large dresser.
 Inside was a stash of healing potions.
 All he needed was one and he could fight again.
 Just one.
 As he reached to open a drawer he felt his leg jerk back, halting his momentum.
 He crashed to the floor, screaming in pain as one of his forearms landed hard.
 Then he felt his ankle start to burn.
 “Take him, brother,” Qurrah said, his whip wrapped around Ahrqur’s left foot.

I could hear nothing but a piercing squall.
 I willed my eyes open, though only a fraction.
 I was looking at the back of a horse from my position slung over someone’s shoulder.
 My eyes closed once more as the pain doubled and I lost my body for a moment.
 I concentrated until I got it back and then realized I was bouncing.
 I worked my eyes again, using every ounce of control I had left.
 I was on a horse, running.
 Not my own.
 Chevelle was holding me in front of him, my body limp and useless.
 I fought to focus on more but was overtaken by pain.

Since I was already on the ground, I really did just want to lie there for a moment, scorpions, dirt and all, but Britney didn't seem to understand that concept.
 Now that my eyes were open and the whole 911 question had been answered, she was determined to get me back on my feet.
 Chapter 8 I was midway through brushing my teeth before I realized I'd had another night filled with nothing but regular dreams.
 I'd walked into two different classes and found out that there were tests I'd forgotten about, been stranded at the side of the road, and been chased through some kind of rain forest, but while some of those dreams had been plenty terrifying, none of them had even a touch of the surreal vividness of the ones I'd had my first few nights in Sanctuary.
 Maybe they were just some kind of psychological defense mechanism popping up in response to all the changes.
 If so, I kind of wished I could be sick still.
 It's a heck of a thing to not want to be healthy, but I'd gone to bed most every night hoping I'd get to experience another one.
 It was depressing to think that I probably had one less thing to look forward to.
 Looking at the clock, I saw that I was a bit behind schedule.
 The bus would be here in about ten minutes, and Britney was supposed to arrive just a tad before that.

From this perspective, the single most important agent of human development is not the institutions of government or those of private enterprise.
 It is the educational system that imparts to future generations the accumulated knowledge, skill and capacity acquired in the past.
 The quality of that education will determine the quality of the human beings who build our future world.
 Until now, too much emphasis has been placed on transfer of information from teacher to student, too little on the development of thinking and critical faculties by the student.
 Too much reliance has been placed on the capacity of the teacher to teach, too little on the inherent natural capacity of human beings for self-motivated learning and self-discovery.
 It may be fair to say that the state of our educational systems throughout the world is an accurate reflection of the state of human development in different societies.
 In this context, the UN Millennium Goals of achieving universal primary education and eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary education represent the bare minimum commitment that every society must make to enhance the capacities of its youth.
 The great Tamil poet, Subramanya Bharati, rightly emphasized that nutrition and education are the two legs of a human being.
 Pre-school education should receive as much attention as post-graduate education.
 At the other end of the development spectrum, no society has yet developed the knowledge and expertise to impart the best of what it has acquired to a broad cross-section of its citizens.

It echoed through the classrooms, with a collective gasp from students and teachers.
 They were excused from class, walked through the desks that lined the classroom, all eyes following them out the door.
 Their parents stood with the principal ready for their arrival at the office.
 As they entered the room it wasn’t hard to see the anger and disappointment.
 They were from different sides of this small town.
 My father’s dad was a butcher, his wife a seamstress.
 My mother’s dad was an oil rig grunt of American-Indian decent, and his wife, a meek submissive homemaker.
 Neither parent thought the other was good enough for their child, let alone the fact that they were both still children.
 Once the reason for the marriage was revealed, their parents accepted it as best as they could.
 My father’s parents arranged for them to live together in a small home while they finished school and awaited the birth of their baby.

When close enough, it latched onto the hand of the biggest child, who awoke screaming.
 Time distorted so that days passed as that scream lingered.
 His face paled, his mouth foamed, and then he died, screaming, still screaming._
 _The vision ended.
 Velixar opened his eyes._
 “What is it that I saw?” he asked.
 “The second time I ever killed,” Qurrah said.
 “I watched that wretched bully succumb to madness from the disease carried by an undead rat.
 He took something I made for my brother, and I made him pay dearly for it.”
 The man in black nodded, going over the memory in his mind.

 I’ve been trying to get him to go out and get a real job, and here you are asking him to do his little song and dance routines for you.
 And you’re cruel enough to let him believe he’s actually any good as a performer.
 God the nerve!
 I don’t ever want to see any of you again in our living room!
 Now get out of here before I call the police!

“Fine,” the leader said.
 “Go and get whatever the abyss you can carry.”
 Harruq climbed into the shed, throwing Qurrah a worried look before he did.
 When he came out holding his sheathed swords to his chest, the guards tensed, readying their weapons.
 “Drop those right now,” they ordered him.
 Harruq clutched them tight, and the look on his face was clear.
 He would fight, and die, before he gave them up.
 The lead guard, already having their coin as well as the bonus of having found elves in hiding, was willing to let it slide.
 “You draw them, even fiddle with them in their sheaths, you die, that clear?” he told the half-orc.
 Harruq nodded, again saying nothing.

"You can try.
 He may even do it, but I don't think so.
 He's far too much the gentleman to keep a lady captive against her will.
 Even if he does, do you really think he can watch over me every second?"
 With a sharp tearing sound, Alec's right hand elongated into the viciously clawed weapon of his hybrid form.
 It shredded the comforter and mattress just a few inches from my head.
 I gave him my best lop-sided smile and kissed his arm.
 "You're not going to scare me off with cheap tricks.
 This is important."
 His eyes were an intense blue, paler than normal.

He saw the double, engraved doors ahead of them, a pair of knights on each side of the door.
 The doors were large enough that the three of them could have entered abreast through the threshold and the doors were solid enough, looking as if they were made out of whole trees.
 Bound in iron, they looked like they could handle a battering ram better than even the front gates.
 A group of knights stood tall next to the doors, but their heads tracked the presence of Rodregas and his two companions.
 Rodregas vaguely remembered one as Gorin, an older man who under more prosperous times for the knighthood would now be enjoying his retirement.
 “Gorin!” Rodregas yelled boastfully, “Open the doors, the Grand Marshal says that I may review the choice I must make.” Rodregas walked over and slapped the knight in the arm, laying it on heavy.
 Luckily, his success on the field had him in a good mood.
 Rodregas waved at the heavy doors as if wiggling his fingers could open them.
 “Sir Rodregas, you look good for having just completed the tournament this day,” said Gorin.
 “I would not expect you to be moving around much yet.” Rodregas nodded.

But I'll make you a good dinner."
 She enjoyed her lunch, the conversation as well as the food.
 Rick told her about how easy it was to get on an airplane any day and go anywhere in the world, about machines that made the house warm in winter and cool in summer, about telephones you could carry in your pocket.
 It was all so amazing.
 She'd always felt that she was living in very modern times—electricity, automobiles, the new talkie.
 The wonders Rick described seemed like magic.
 They settled down on his sofa after lunch.
 "I'll start with the books.
 You do the articles," Rick said.
 "See if they say anything about the possibilities of time travel and how you'd go about it."

Rodregas yearned to reach out and touch to see if they felt like flesh or stone.
 But, to do so would set his path for the rest of his life.
 If he was truly strong enough for two as Imeralda thought, then he could be a lion and what else?
 “Well, Doi’van, what do you think?” Rodregas asked.
 “I am going to choose lion, but it would be great to have a pride, or maybe the Moon Wolf or the Mountain Bear.” Doi’van nodded and walked over to the bear.
 It was a kind of bear that Rodregas had not heard of in the mortal world, even larger than ‘his’ lion.
 The bear actually had a thick tail and its teeth seemed far larger than any bear he had heard of.
 Doi’van stood there looking up at the great beast for a long moment.
 Then he cocked his head; his nose went up as if he smelled something.
 He stepped around the great bear and headed toward the back wall.

The two huddled over the fire, each lost in their thoughts.
 Harruq broke the silence first.
 “So where will we go?” he asked.
 “Where else is there?” Qurrah said.
 “Perhaps we were meant to go to Woodhaven.
 The journey will not be long, perhaps a week or two at most.
 There are enough animals about for me to kill, so do not worry about food.
 As for water, there are many small streams, and we can beg from the occasional farms we pass.
 We were to leave anyway, now we do so sooner.”
 “Sooner?” Harruq said.

“Why do you flee?” Harruq roared when her crying eyes glanced back at him.
 “This life is pain, suffering!
 I’m here to end it, end it all!”
 The woman ran faster and her child cried louder.
 It didn’t matter.
 Harruq rammed her with his shoulder.
 To protect her child, the woman rolled so that her side took the brunt of the fall.
 As the half-orc’s blades twirled in the air, the mother kissed her child one last time before curling up around the joy of her life.
 Then the blades fell.
 On the half-orc ran.

We all remember the swamp troll.” Seth frowned and Jason snickered.
 Seth punched his arm.
 “Hey don’t make me nag you about the time you almost took off my head with your throwing knifes.” Jason stopped dead and narrowed his eyes.
 “It was an accident.
 I didn’t know you’d run that way.” “Alright, we understand that we’ve all done stupid, foolish things.
 So let’s just add this accident to my list, okay?” I said quickly before the two started something.
 They nodded but shot each other smirks.
 I sighed, wondering why those two buffoons had been granted this power along, with Emily and me.
 It’s not like they weren’t foolish enough already.
 The day when it all changed was still a mystery to us.

Rachel was shaking, and the blonde looked like someone about to pull the wings off a butterfly.
 I could feel my heartbeat climbing, slamming away at my ribs with all the energy of a full-blown panic attack, but I wasn't dizzy, just scared.
 The cafeteria workers had all turned around so their backs were facing us, a sight which kindled the first spark of anger, an emotion that burned brighter because of the fear still coursing through me.
 There was a gasp as Cassie shoved Rachel, a misleadingly casual motion that sent the smaller girl stumbling back into Alec's chest hard enough to leave bruises.
 The typical catcalls were still absent, it was as if nobody viewed this as a normal fight, like there was somehow more at stake.
 I'd been waiting for someone to intervene on Rachel's behalf.
 It was obvious she knew nothing about fighting.
 Cassie wasn't the kind of girl to fight just to prove a point and then forget about the incident afterwards.
 Just looking at her, I knew she'd remember any slight for as long as she lived, and she had enough influence in the school to make just about anyone's life miserable.
 She probably got away with things just because nobody was willing to cross her.

“Nice PJs Emily.” I chuckled.
 She stuck her tongue out, “What do you have against sun-tanning penguins?” “Nothing!” I smiled to myself.
 I shouldn’t be talking; I was wearing pajamas covered in little pigs.
 Emily leaned back to turn off her desk light.
 It clicked off and I gazed outside one more time before turning around to go to bed.
 “Night Emily.” I yawned.
 Emily didn’t reply because her face was pushed up against the window.
 Her body was ridged and she didn’t move.
 I crawled over to the window.
 “What is it, Em?” I whispered, a nervous feeling creeping into my stomach.

"All right."
 "Come on--you can sleep in a guest room."
 "Wait."
 She pressed her lips together.
 "May I sleep here on the sofa?
 I-I'd rather not be so far from you."
 "OK."  He smiled, going to the linen closet and returning with a sheet.
 "Here you go.
 Yell if you need anything."
 He went to search through the refrigerator and the cabinets.

Then again, maybe burns wouldn't be so bad if they let me disappear into the anonymity of a large crowd in an actual city rather than dealing with hick hostility.
 "That sounds great; I can't wait to get out of this stupid town."
 A couple of people started a bit, and I heard a locker slam shut with surprising force.
 The eavesdroppers were predictably pissed I was dissing their home, but I didn't care.
 It served them right.
 Don't listen in if you aren't prepared to hear something you won't like.
 As long as my comments hadn't offended my new pseudo-friend, I was just fine.
 Britney laughed.
 "You said it.

The bad news is that it is up to each competing squire to have his own equipment for the other three competitions.
 The sword and the shield competition are limited to light armor.
 You will be at a disadvantage.
 The real problem is going to the completion with the lance and the mace.
 Both have no limit to the armor; and of course, the lance is a mounted competition.
 “You should see some of the horses!” said Imeralda.
 “They are beautiful.” She smiled but at her words Doi’van clearly did not see beautiful animals but a problem.
 “She is correct; most have trained war horses and a few are Dire Steeds.
 I will be honest Rodregas, I am not sure that this will work.
 These warriors are trained in the use of the lance and their war horses will negate your personal advantage in physical might, as your horse is a trail mount.” Doi’van paused and said, “But, the real problem is that you are without plate armor.

His features, however, kept changing.
 Every time Qurrah blinked the man’s face reassembled in some minutely different way.
 No matter how high or low his nose, or how wide or narrow his forehead, those burning eyes remained.
 “What are you?” Qurrah asked.
 Velixar laughed.
 “How much do you know of the gods of this world, Qurrah Tun?”
 Qurrah shrugged.
 “I know their names and little else.
 Karak is death, Ashhur is life, and Celestia everything else, if the ramblings of priests and elves is to be believed.”
 Velixar nodded, the fire in his eyes growing.

Alec shrugged and gave me another smile.
 "You must have driven your parents crazy with that refusal to back down."
 "I suppose I might have frustrated them a time or two."
 "And to think Rachel says I'm stubborn."
 I started to smile, but stopped as he cocked his head to the side in what was unmistakably a listening posture.
 "What's the matter?
 What do you hear?"
 "Jasmin just left."
 "What's wrong with that?"
 "It's not safe for her to leave the estate.

 "I'm a virgin, Mother.
 But I love Rick with all my heart."
 Mrs. Tranton swallowed, twisting her hands.

She always had a bright smile and she treated us with an abundance of love.
 She was a heavy woman and her girth made her seem even shorter than she was.
 She had an infectious laugh.
 Grandma worked at a department store named Zodies.
 On occasion, my mother would take us to the store to visit her on her break.
 We would run from aisle to aisle searching for her brightly colored smock.
 One of the few times I ever remember eating out was when we shared her lunch break and ate hot dogs and popcorn at the department store cafeteria.
 I still think of Grandma whenever I walk into a discount store and smell the snack bar.
 We lived with our grandparents longer than we should have, but my mother had little choice.
 My mother, still young and very attractive, was saddled with the responsibility of two young boys who knew nothing about her predicament.

 The broad range of topics examined by the International Commission on Peace and Food demonstrates the interrelated nature of the challenges of peace and development.
 Your collective endeavour illustrates the fact that no longer can global peace and security remain the preserve of political and military specialists.
 Without an adequate development effort, there can be no lasting peace and security.
 Conflicts over resources, ultra-nationalism exacerbated by the tensions of unemployment, poverty and despair at home will inevitably lead to resentment, and resentment turns only too easily into armed conflict.
 The establishment of secure foundations for peace will be aided by development and post-conflict peace building.
 Yet if there is a growing international consensus on the peace operations undertaken by the United Nations, there is no such consensus on its developmental work.

It was hard to believe this was the same person I'd had to rescue from Cassie so recently.
 I stopped Rachel just before she could put the impressive lungful of air she'd just taken in to whatever use she'd planned.
 "It's okay.
 I'm better.
 The lane's dusty and exercise would do me good."
 She hesitated, obviously torn, but my fumbling fingers finally found the unfamiliar door release and I made the decision for her.
 I swung the door open and slipped out of the car before she could respond.
 I waved goodbye with a cheery casualness I thought did a pretty good job of hiding my desire to break into tears.
 It was amazing how I'd let the numbness slip away for nothing.
 Rachel wasn't any more my friend than she'd been a few minutes before.

The Iran–Iraq War, the war in Afghanistan and the Gulf War involved the use of ballistic missiles against civilian centres.
 In all, over 5,000 surface-to-surface missiles have targeted population centres during the last five decades.
 The devastating effect of even conventional weapons on economic activity and society in general is so great that today no developed nation can afford the costs of military confrontation, either at home or overseas.
 No longer can non-combatants sit quietly on the sidelines or work productively undisturbed.
 War both between and within states has come to involve and affect all of society.
 Infrastructure and production facilities have become a principal target of military action.
 Food supplies are frequently the first major casualty and most lethal weapon.
 A single explosion can paralyze a major metropolis or contaminate an entire region with toxic material, dwarfing the devastation caused by the industrial accidents at Chernobyl and Bhopal.
 The disruption of trade resulting even from regional conflicts such as the Gulf War or the war in Bosnia, impacts not only on the economies of the belligerents, but also on neighbours, trading partners and global economic performance.
 Neither the victor nor the victim can any longer afford to resolve conflicts violently.

It was possibly the most brazen act of class cutting I'd ever seen, and somehow it didn't surprise me in the least.
 Even so, I spent the rest of the hour stewing while working on the pointless, busywork assignment the sub handed out.
 Mrs. Tiggs still hadn't finished grading our tests, which meant I still had no idea how I'd done.
 By the time I finally half-collapsed at my normal table in the tutor lab, all I could think about was how nice it would be to see Brandon one more time as he drove me home.
 I looked around to verify that all of the usual suspects were there.
 Geeks, check.
 Jocks, check.
 Rachel and her sinister sidekick James, check.
 I smiled at Rachel and then flipped open my math book.
 Everything went just like normal, and promptly at five I closed my binder and started stuffing books into my backpack.

“Hemorrhage,” Velixar hissed.
 The frail half-orc smiled, loving the sound.
 Harruq sat nearby.
 The spidery, intangible lessons in spellcasting had little to do with him, but he politely remained silent and respected their usefulness
 “Harruq Tun,” Velixar said suddenly, jolting him from his drifting thoughts.
 “Yes, master?” he asked, rising and straightening his back.
 He could feel the eyes of his brother on him and did not wish to disappoint.
 “Qurrah has told me of the troubles in your heart.
 I must see them.”
 “He did?” Harruq asked, glancing at his brother.

“I thought a lot of them used ones that help wizards not to grow old.” “That is true,” said Imeralda with a shrug.
 “A healing sigil is why wizards live so long.
 It is considered by most to be the moral choice instead of the Immortalists’ answer for long life.” “What about you Doi’van?” Rodregas asked.
 “Imeralda says that you are almost as powerful as me as a magician.
 If we found a way, would you like to take on some of the power of the sigils?” he asked.
 Rodregas had expected an immediate response, but instead his question was followed by a long pause before Doi’van answered.
 Rodregas had learned that Doi’van thought before speaking.
 “I am not sure.
 I like learning magic, though I am just beginning.
 I would think that I would take on a minor sigil or two.

The other men drew back, some sitting, some standing, but all giving him their full attention and space as he raised his hands and braced himself, taking one full deep breath before shifting forward, ever so slightly.
 A thunderous crack and excruciating light flew from both of his outstretched hands, slammed into a tall pine, and snapped the top third of the tree off.
 Several limbs splintered and popped as it crashed its way down.
 I stared in open-mouthed astonishment.
 Sweat glistened on the large man’s forehead and his breath was a little labored, but still, he stood.
 Understanding came slowly.
 He had shot lightning from his hands.
 The others nodded appreciatively, but I was having second thoughts about friendship with this man.
 Though not being his friend was probably more dangerous.
 I was shaking my head in disbelief as he turned back to me and bowed.

He was outside their little home in seconds, urinating on the grass.
 “Hadn’t pissed yet,” Harruq shouted to his brother.
 “You could be a bit kinder, you know.”
 “At least you’re awake,” Qurrah said back.
 “Now get to the castle.
 I may not approve, and I still don’t trust them, but for once we might have something worthwhile to eat.
 I won’t let a simple thing like sleep keep us from it.”

I sucked in a harsh breath, unable to get my mind to accept what I knew was happening.
 I had been so oblivious.
 Reading the diary, learning of my mother and her ties to the throne.
 It had told of my own life, of what I was to become, a reality that would not be put to rights in my broken mind.
 But as I stared down, the assembled pieces of my shattered self held together by no more than tattered bits of string, I understood.
 This was my place.
 I heard Ruby behind me now.
 In a low voice she said, “They have heard of your return.
 They have come to see for themselves.” Their rulers had burned, along with so many of their families.
 After the massacre, there had been no one.

Ruby handed me another drink.
 It helped, but I was still irritated about the binding.
 “Does this mean we’ll have to train again?” Ruby snickered.
 Chevelle answered slowly, “There has to be a way.
 You broke them before.” I tried to remember how.
 The first magic I could recall was the thistle in the back room at Junnie’s.
 It seemed so far away now.
 Ruby was speaking to him.
 “Maybe it was just the length of time…” What did she know about how long I was bound?
 “If we can find a way to test without endangering—” He stopped.

Scientists report that the ozone layer is being restored to pre-1970 levels far more rapidly than had been anticipated.
 This has been aided by a worldwide rush to renewable energy power generation led by such regions as California, which now produces 10,000 megawatts of electricity from wind power and has mandated an increase in pollution-free motor vehicles from the present level of 5 per cent to 25 per cent by 2010.
 Common sense tells us it is not possible simply to wish away the serious problems barring these achievements.
 We need the technology vastly to improve productivity in poor countries.
 We need the organizational know-how to create effective administrative and political systems in transition states and to restructure international institutions.
 We require enormous investments in constructive economic activities – as opposed to lavish arms spending – to generate jobs and higher incomes for hundreds of millions of people in the developing world, and by extension to stimulate further economic growth and job creation in the West.
 All these essential ingredients are available in abundant measure, if only we choose to employ them for our common benefit.
 Yet even this is not enough.
 Otherwise, we would already have accomplished many of our goals.
 Above and beyond these material, social and financial resources, we need a new vision, a new perspective and new attitudes about what can and must be done.

Seth gave me a maniac’s grin, “You already know the answer to that.” Then he shot me right in the face.
 I blocked most of the spray from my face but water still leaked through my fingers.
 I felt the cold water seep through my clothes and onto my skin as Seth continued to soak me.
 “Crap Jason, shut it off!” Emily hollered but it didn’t work because I heard her yell again as he sprayed her hair.
 I couldn’t see anything because my eyes were half shut and I was afraid Seth would wash my eyes out.
 “Seth seriously, stop.” You can’t command boys to do anything and to prove that, Seth shot my butt.
 Eventually they stopped, only because three water guns can hold only so much water and Emily and me looked like we could kill.
 We were both completely soaked to the bone and even though in was the middle of summer, we were shivering.
 The boys looked completely satisfied with how we looked.
 After Emily and I gave them a look, they tore down the street and disappeared.

I'd been right, which had made me glad I'd compromised and come in my one and only sun dress.
 Alec apparently hadn't gotten the memo.
 He was in an honest-to-goodness full tux.
 I wasn't the only one stunned by how good he looked; there was a ripple of turned heads as people noticed his entrance.
 He paced the short distance down to the back row of seats with such incredible grace that I felt my mouth go dry.
 No one person should be so attractive, not when there wasn't enough of him to go around to every single woman in the world.
 For a few seconds I forgot all about the reasons I didn't like him, and just wished he was sitting in front of me instead of two rows behind me where I couldn't see him.
 Then I realized what his arrival really meant.
 Rachel had stood me up.
 She wasn't on the bus, and she apparently hadn't come with her brother, so she wasn't coming.

 Jim – (Dumbfounded) And you complain that Gene is cruel.
 Liz – (Slaps him) Damint Jim tell me.
 Eugene – GODZILLA!
 Jim – Alright, alright.
 Well you remember when Gene was calling people up at three in the morning and doing that evil laugh…
 Liz – Yeah, that got annoying…
 Jim – I know, he did it to me like 10 times.
 Liz – So?
 Jim – Finally I just snapped and told him that calling people and laughing like a maniac wasn’t evil, it was just annoying.

The elf charged in, knowing he outmatched the half-orc in speed and skill.
 The kill would be his.
 “ _Hemorrhage._ ”
 A sudden purging of blood vessels exploded across Ahrqur’s side.
 The force smashed him into a decorative table.
 He rolled off the broken thing and glanced down at the blood soaking his robe.
 Despite the wound, no cut or hole was visible in the cloth.
 “You are pathetic, Ahrqur,” Qurrah said, his hands whirling.
 “You are skilled but you are soft.
 You lack spirit, will.

He talked about money, women, and other stuff he’d missed while in prison.
 When he asked if we would be looking for work in Miami and we said probably, he nodded and chucked my arm.
 “Hey, the boss will set you up.” The boss lived in a palace on a canal.
 He was a midget who needed a wheelchair, but whose live-in babe was about twice his height and half his age.
 She reminded me of the barmaid in New Orleans.
 I was mourning the loss of that dream when the midget said, “You guys from San Diego, must’ve driven a boat now and then.” Bob said he had driven a couple speedboats.
 “Sure you did,” the midget said.
 “Johnny’ll get you the boat.
 All you gotta do is take it out a coupla miles, pick up some items, bring’em in.
 You’re game, right?” After considering the looks worn by the midget, Johnny, and even the babe, we said, “Right.

By the time his jaw and mind began working again, Aurelia was laughing.
 “What’s so funny?” he demanded.
 The elf smiled.
 “Nothing.
 Just a big stupid half-orc I’m going to miss.
 Bye-bye.”
 She waved and then vanished into the forest.
 For a long time, Harruq remained.
 He ran a hand through his hair and pondered what in the abyss was wrong with him.
 “Never get involved with elves,” he mumbled.

She might be our host now but I’d get my chance.
 I’d fix her.
 She shifted and the markings on her leg caught my attention.
 A thin painted vine trailed up to her thigh.
 She noticed me looking.
 “Well, Frey, I feel like I know so much about you.” She smiled slyly at Chevelle.
 “But you know so little of me.
 Let me tell you a few things, since we will be traveling together.” I felt my head jerk to find Chevelle, not believing what I had just heard.
 Ruby continued without pause.
 “I’m sure you’ve heard by now I’m an amalgamation, a half-breed.” She said the last part with distaste and glanced at Steed.

How could they, right?
 How could they?
 Of course, this was while it was spinning out of control for me.
 Slowly spinning out of control, like I could chart it.
 Like I could write it out on a graph—the Venn diagram of how to have a nervous breakdown.
 And the sixties were winding down like a colorful toy that was starting to show its cracks and whose motor was creaky with rust.
 Altamount followed.
 Manson.
 Things were getting grim.
 More and more people in the street but it didn’t look like those fuckers in Washington were gonna do a damn thing different—the war, shit, look at it, it’s just deeper and deeper shit.

Let's get you inside."
 I nodded and started towards the door, only to blink as Alec stepped in front of me.
 "May I have permission to enter and make sure it's safe inside?"
 I slowed down, suddenly terrified at the thought of Brandon and his friends waiting inside for me.
 "I thought you said you'd be able to smell them if they were here."
 "If they were outside, yes.
 Under normal circumstances we'd be able to determine whether or not they'd been here in the last few days, but the rainstorm last night was strong enough to wash away all of that."
 Alec waited patiently as I tried to get a grip on myself.
 As soon as I nodded he disappeared through the door.
 A few seconds later he was back.

I sighed in relief when the bell rang, and pulled out my schedule and map to see where I'd be going next.
 Physics?
 I mentally reviewed my conversation with the secretary, but couldn't remember either of us mentioning the class.
 As if trying to catch up in Algebra wasn't going to be bad enough, I was going to face the same kind of problem in physics.
 Grumbling to myself, I promised to try and switch into something better first thing tomorrow morning.
 The class was in a section of the building I hadn't been to yet, one apparently older than the rest of the building.
 The lights were spaced further apart and the cinder blocks in the walls were a slightly different size.
 Good thing I still had my water.
 The old part of the school was just as hot as the rest.
 You'd think functioning air-conditioning would be a necessity for a school so far south.

Art – No, but she dropped hints, and that woman was persistent.
 I had no clue what was going on.
 Jim – Until grandpa filled you in.
 Art – What a family tradition he started.
 Jim – Did grandma go insane too?
 Art – I don’t think so, but she died when I was six.
 Jim – Not a good way to start a tradition.
 Art – Nope, it could be worse though.
 Jim – Yes it could, it could have karaoke as an integral part of the ceremony.
 Art – Dad has more taste then that, not by much, but enough.

She'd loved the pizza they'd had last night.
 It had been thick and gooey and messy.
 She'd found it both delicious and fun to eat.
 "Maybe tomorrow night.
 I think we need something a little less fattening tonight.
 Why don't I barbecue some chicken?"
 She wrapped potatoes and put them in the oven while he got the grill going.
 "Do you barbecue in 1927?"
 "My family doesn't.
 Other people do."

 Jim – So you did.

 Jim – Why is that?
 Eugene – We’re discussing whether or not we would have decided to have been conceived.

I wouldn’t be surprised if you tripped on your own feet.” “Yup, that’s me, clumsy.” I pulled my leg close to my body.
 My parents had believed for a long time that I was a klutz.
 That was the only way to explain the million of cuts and bruises I gained from fighting creatures.
 The truth is that I have really great balance, which I had gained from so much fighting.
 I was a little klutzy when I was small, so it was easy for my parents to believe I still was.
 Mom placed the food on the table.
 “Dinner!”
 After dinner I went straight up stairs to go to sleep.
 And hopefully my phone wouldn’t stop me like it did most nights.
 Monsters loved to come out at night and cause trouble.

The object of our discussion was currently backing away from James while trying to keep Jessica from circling around behind him.
 I finally realized what I'd always thought of as grace was really an economy of motion.
 It was like he was saving every possible bit of energy because he never knew when he'd find it necessary to burn up his reserves in a blaze of violence.
 Even as I watched, he spun around, plucking Jessica out of the air, grabbing her by the head mid-leap as she sought to find purchase on this throat.
 He tried to spin back around to meet James' rush, but the smaller hybrid knocked him down with a crash.
 Isaac and Jasmin were there in a blink, tearing the other two wolves off of Alec before the conflict could turn deadly.
 I couldn't breathe until the dust settled, and Alec rolled back up to his feet, dripping blood from a large gash in his side.
 Dominic heard my sudden gasp and reached over to reassure me.
 "He's okay.
 We heal fast, and he heals faster than most."

 I think I’d like to hear them then, too bad you can’t get away with calling that art.

 Karen – The censors would have a conniption.
 Then all to them all the parental groups tearing their hair out and protesting.
 It would be pure chaos.
 Art - Some people say that there isn’t any such thing as bad publicity.
 Besides, she could just call it a performance piece, as someone who has seen the show already, that girl performs when she curses.
 It’s a sight to see, I just can’t tell whether it’s a natural wonder or a natural disaster.
 One thing is for certain, someone will have to put a rating for the content on the posters and ads.

Rachel's a good girl, but she was so young when he died.
 She can't really miss him.
 Not like I miss him."
 For a second I thought he was going to argue with her.
 His tired smile had the feel of resignation, of something that'd been well argued over the years.
 "Will you play something for us, Mother?
 Adriana hasn't had the pleasure of listening to your songs."
 I'd rarely seen anyone change moods so quickly.
 "No.
 You know it isn't ready.

“And what is that?”
 Aurelia leaned back and tucked a few strands of hair behind her ear as high above the stars sparkled sadly.
 “Promise you will never strike at me, or those close to me, ever again.”
 The half-orc shifted uncomfortably in the grass.
 “You know I’d never do that.”
 “No, Harruq, I don’t know.
 I think I know, I desperately want to believe I know, but I don’t.
 So promise me.”
 “Aurry…”
 “Promise me now, or I will drag you back to the elves and let them deal the justice you deserve.”

“Will do Jazell.” He stood up and walked over to Emily.
 I sat on the ground next to Seth.
 His eyes were closed and he looked dead.
 His blue hair was ruffled up in all directions.
 I was so sure that he might be dead that I placed a hand on his chest, feeling for a heartbeat.
 I felt the steady thump under my fingers and I sighed in relief.
 I removed my hand and looked over at Emily.
 They had freed the dragon and they both were petting its head.
 It stretched its wings and they both had to duck to avoid being hit.
 “Seth,” I whispered, “this is what I meant when I said things would get bad if we didn't tell them.” I looked back at my two friends, who were laughing.

"It was a bit at first, especially right after Alec first started manifesting.
 Okay, maybe I was crazy jealous then, and again a couple of years later when it became apparent I wasn't going to manifest anything, but I got over it."
 My raised eyebrow was completely involuntary, and apparently more eloquent than I'd realized.
 At least it earned me another laugh.
 "It wasn't like it was easy or anything, but Donovan gave me some good advice when things were the worst.
 I don't remember his exact words, but essentially it came down to the fact that there'll always be people who're better than me at something.
 Even gaining super powers wouldn't change that.
 What's important is that I do the best I can with what I've been given.
 As crazy as it sounds, Alec's pack needs me."
 I mentally reached around for something similar and then finally nodded.

As it slides from side to side the lighter is moved just ahead of it.
 The pill slowly vaporizes as it is cooked from beneath.
 A thin line of fumes from the pill is released into the air and the addict inhales the vapor through a stem pipe.
 Addicts hardly notice that their fingers and thumbs burn; blisters form where the flame licks back from the bottom of the foil.
 As the pill slides back and forth, it leaves behind a zigzagging black mark resembling a line made by an indelible pen.
 This technique is called “chasing the dragon,” and is reminiscent of a technique for ingesting heroin, Oxy’s unfashionable, yet omnipresent, cousin.
 When addicts become so addicted that they cannot afford the quantity of Oxy they need to satisfy their cravings, as the appetite exceeds the budget, it is time for the next phase of this vicious cycle.
 Addicts will do what they said they would never do.
 Steal money.
 Sell their bodies to strangers.

“Yes,” Ahrqur said.
 The words dripped out of his mouth, quiet and disgusted.

 “How long ago?”
 “Many years.
 Fifteen.
 Twenty.”

I could only shake my head as Ruby clapped beside me, clearly thrilled with the show.
 I thought I must have missed something.
 Grey bowed out of the circle and was replaced by the two tall, silvery elves.
 I found myself startled again; I had not seen them sitting with the group, or anywhere else.
 For some reason, it was much more eerie than the little wiry man who blinked in and out of vision.
 One of the men spoke, his tone formal.
 “We will not demonstrate their full power at this time, in fear of shorting our forces a man for mere display.” I assumed he was probably joking.
 “As you can see, they can be frightening, however, without attack.” At that, the dogs walked into the circle.
 I had not seen them either, before they were approaching their masters.
 They came forward to snarl, one regarding Ruby and one Steed, and I could only be glad it wasn’t me as their muzzles pulled back and exposed a vicious set of teeth, complete with meat-tearing fangs.

"I'm Adr...Adriana."
 Our handshake had ended, but my hand was tingling slightly.
 It was a pleasant, if illusionary, reminder of the contact, one I was hoping would last for about the next three days.
 "You must be the poor soul who's got everyone buzzing with curiosity."
 Brandon reached into the tall, glass-fronted fridge next to the cashier while he was talking, and pulled out a bottle of water and one of those aggressively-colored energy drinks.
 He slipped some money to the cashier while I was still trying to come up with a response that didn't sound stupid.
 "Um, yeah.
 We just got into town last night."
 He handed me the bottle of water.
 "Well I hope you'll like it here."

He claimed his dad was a Mafioso until he got on some capo’s hit list and fled to parts unknown.
 Bobby was a master storyteller, and one of his stories pierced my soul.
 In summers, Bobby worked as a bartender at the Left Bank, a saloon in Lindenhurst, Long Island.
 One of the regulars was Jack Kerouac.
 My only living hero, according to Bobby, had become nothing more than a woeful drunk who sat brooding over his liquor until closing time.
 Then, most every evening, he went home with whatever washed out female lasted so long.
 Raskolnikov
 While Bob and I drove home in a 1952 Chevy we bought for $20 from Bobby Casso, I was a lousy companion.
 All I could think about were tragedies.

A new publication identifies a few hundred self-employment opportunities of this kind.
 The future of work will offer increasing opportunities for people throughout the world to match their specialized knowledge and skills with specialized employment opportunities wherever they may originate.
 Meeting the Skill Shortage: Perhaps the single greatest opportunity for employment growth lies in addressing the growing mismatch between the skills of job seekers and the skills required for expanding economies.
 In both industrial and developing countries, workers may be in surplus, but the skills needed are in deficit.
 In the most prosperous nations, the deficit is concentrated in high technology and professional sectors, in electronics, biotechnology, health care, pharmacology, mathematics, marketing, financial services, and the like.
 The adoption of new technologies even in traditional occupations has resulted in a growing demand for higher skill levels in these fields as well.
 Unemployment is highest among the least educated, least skilled categories, such as machine operators, fabricators and labourers.
 The poor are poor both because they have no assets and because their time and labour have low or no economic value.
 Poverty persists wherever the human resource is under-valued.
 To eradicate it, there is need for a paradigm shift from unskilled to skilled work.

Her light brown hair was almost blonde without any gray in it.
 The woman definitely did not look her age at all, and she was still as beautiful as I imagined she was in her youth.
 She smiled warmly at us, her smile a reflection of Emily’s.
 “Hello girls, come in.
 Emily, dear, can you put your laundry away?
 After you do that, you can hang out in your room.” Emily nodded and disappeared inside.
 Her mom moved aside so I could walk in.
 I unlaced my sneakers and walked up the stairs, looking at the flower paintings hung along the wall that her mom had painted in her spare time.
 I pushed open Emily’s bedroom door to see her stuffing her clothes in the drawer and flopping onto the bed.
 She pulled out my bag and threw it to me so I could set up my sleeping bag on her rug.

A centering object, a holy thing.
 But he became a dream-figure, a part of my unconscious, as I understand the term.
 Is Bob Dylan more than a man?
 Is he more than a man with an extraordinary gift?
 Is he really something holy?
 Of course not.
 He is just an exceptional artist, a poet, a singer of peculiar power and persuasion and grace.
 So, what happened?
 What happens to any of us who find a particular artist who speaks to our very hearts?
 Is it right, just, meet?

"I hope my mother doesn't faint when she sees me."
 "You really miss her."
 "Yes.
 There have been times in the last five weeks when I really needed her.
 Needed to talk to her."
 "When you get back, what are you going to talk to her about?"
 "You."
 Fresh tears ran down her cheeks.
 He tilted her chin up, wiping away her tears.
 "Won't you consider staying here with me?

I kind of fuzzed out.
 The next thing I knew Brandon was pulling onto our cement pad.
 "So it looks like Britney's out.
 Do you mind if I give you a ride home on Tuesdays and Thursdays?"
 Did I mind?
 Of course not.
 "That would be really great.
 Thanks for offering."
 Brandon ran one finger down the side of my face, and then leaned back with a smile as I reached for the door.
 It wasn't until I was out of the car that I realized our Jeep was parked in its normal spot off to the side of the house.

“We will win this fight, mark my words.
 Kojas is going down, way down if you know what I mean.” “Well,” he said, “if you let me go I'll give him your message.” “I don't think so,” I whispered.
 “You can tell him when he joins you.” I rammed my knife into his stomach and pulled it out.
 The faery's eyes rolled upward and he went still.
 I wiped my knife on my pants and sheathed it.
 I ran over to Jason, who was crouched over the unconscious Seth.
 Jason looked up and I saw his face was full of concern.
 “Can you help Emily, she's trying to release the trapped dragon,” I whispered to him.
 Jason nodded.
 “Will do Jazell.” He stood up and walked over to Emily.

Her breath caught, and tears filled her eyes.
 "I-I can't, Rick.
 I have to go home."
 She squeezed his hand.
 "My home, my family, everything I know is in 1927.
 My mother has been saving her wedding gown for me.
 It was my grandmother's too.
 And-and I want my own daughter to wear it."
 But she wanted that daughter to be Rick's, she realized with despair.
 Rick kissed her cheek, his heart aching for both of them.

Jim – Better Gene than me!
 Liz – Jim!
 Eugene – What’s that supposed to mean?
 Jim – What?
 It was creepy getting hit on by your mother.
 It felt kind of like that movie the Graduate, except that it only wierded me out and I didn’t get to see her in the nude.
 Eugene – Shes still in remarkably good shape for…
 Liz and Jim – You?
 Eugene – No, well not really, well sorta but not really.
 Liz – You, you, with my mother?
