I awoke to an empty house, and then hurried to get ready and down to the bus stop so I wouldn't be stranded if nobody else showed up to give me a ride into school.
 Brandon smiled as he pulled up and found me patiently waiting for the school bus.
 "One of these days you're going to go ahead and wait for me at your house, and then I'll know you finally trust me."
 I didn't feel much like playful banter, but I marshaled a semi-convincing smile and gave it my best go.
 "Oh, I trust you, I just know that you've got more important things to worry about.
 One of these times you'll either forget to come get me, or you'll forget to tell me you're not coming by anymore."
 Brandon let the silence build for several seconds.
 "I'd try and convince you I'm not going to do any of that to you, but I suspect that's just going to take time."
 I was busy kicking myself for having cast such a pall over the morning, when Brandon sighed.
 "We should talk about what happened to you yesterday."

 It's a very frightening day. Hula has taken up a residence in my town. I get to see a lot of my friends coming back, and they're in significant numbers. While there's a whole lot of drama in our world, it's just been a give and

I think if you just walk straight out that way, you'll get home."
 She linked her arms around his neck, still clutching the paper bag.
 "I love you with all my heart, Rick.
 This is tearing me apart.
 I want to spend my life with you.
 But I have to go home."
 "I'll never love another woman the way I love you.
 I can't even imagine how I'm going to deal with the void you're about to create."
 Tears sparkled in her eyes.
 "I'm sorry."

 "Im sorry. Cry for me, don't. You just want to go home," he whispered. She wrapped her hand gently across his upper arms. "I already have you, I've just gotten you, and I'll leave without messing you up

But the memories that came back when I woke from those vivid nightmares were dull.
 The harder I clutched at them, the more they drew away.
 When recognition dawned, I leapt from the rock, cursing Chevelle.
 He turned to me as I yelled, “Give it back!” He didn’t appear to know what I was talking about, but I was so angry I was having trouble forming the demand.
 “Give my memories, my mind back!” His confusion cleared, but Chevelle didn’t offer a response.
 The fire in me itched to burn him.
 I seethed.
 “Unbind my thoughts.” “Freya.” His voice was smooth.
 “You don’t understand.” I fumed, “Well, I’m sure that has nothing to do with you rummaging around in there.” He shook his head and his complete lack of agitation caused me to take pause.
 I supposed it was possible he actually couldn’t free my thoughts.

I'd never done anything to him.
 Did he really hate me so much just because I'd told him off about not protecting Rachel?
 Cassie was waiting for me at my locker when I got there.
 "Brandon wanted me to stop by and let you know he had a few things to take care of, so he won't see you during lunch.
 You can still come sit with us if you want."
 The words were right.
 If I'd been reading them off of a page in a book, I probably would've believed them, but the way she delivered them left no doubt in my mind.
 She didn't want me at their table.
 The only reason she'd stopped by my locker was because Brandon had told her to.
 "Thanks, but I have some studying to do.

 I opened the door for her. "Oh," I started to whisper, turning around my office desk to look at Daniel. Cassie was shaking my hand. "We're about to start with lunch today, but Kim looks good, so you can wait around until after she's

He was surprised any wild animals would be this close to the noise of a fight.
 Rodregas waited for an opening, but it was hard to know exactly what was going on in the dark.
 He was bleeding from his belly wound, and decided that he could not wait.
 Rodregas decided to pull his short swords from the harness on his side and, at the same time, rush in on the big guy.
 The large attacker was big and powerful, but his rake had shattered and Rodregas had his short swords on his harness.
 His attacker appeared to not have a back up weapon.
 Then a voice rang out, “Stop, STOP, it is not him!
 It is not the Sorcerer Ravenhurr.” It was a woman’s voice.
 Then a much deeper voice, one that seemed half growl, responded, “She is right.
 This is no sorcerer we fight.” The voice was from his present combatant, the only one who had proven to be dangerous to him.

A tiny figure barely recognizable as Rachel, was walking towards a dark-blue bullet bike, which had just roared to life.
 We had to walk several more steps before I recognized the leather-clad, dark-haired figure on the bike as Alec.
 My feet must have unconsciously slowed because Britney was now several steps ahead of me and looking back impatiently.
 I tried to catch up, but Alec chose that moment to look up and stare in our direction.
 He was quite a ways away, and his lovely eyes were covered by a pair of sunglasses, but I somehow knew he was looking at me.
 He handed Rachel a helmet but continued to look at us, at me, while she put it on.
 I was moving again, but my pulse sped up as Rachel grabbed a hold of her brother and swung her leg over the pillion seat on the bike.
 She seemed to see us for the first time as a cold chill arced down my back and the horizon started to vibrate.
 I managed to raise my hand in response to her wave, but it was an absent motion.
 My attention was still on Alec and his unwavering stare.

The rest of the group was quiet, watching us, and Ruby eyed Steed as we turned and headed toward the house.
 As soon as we were out of earshot, though I was still being dragged by the arm, I asked Chevelle, “Did something happen with the twins?” Ruby laughed.
 We both stared at her.
 “Twins,” she scoffed.
 “Right, well, you know what I mean,” I said, embarrassed.
 Chevelle’s tone softened.
 “No.
 Everything is fine.” Ruby chimed in, “It is fine,” and I was knew it was intended for him.
 He relaxed his grip on my arm and slowed our pace as he directed an almost imperceptible nod at Ruby.
 I relaxed, too; fine being better than anything I’d thought in a long while.

He assumed the elf spoke the human tongue, and the sudden killing lunge proved him correct.
 Antonil pulled his head back, the point stopping just shy of drawing blood.
 An upward cut took the blade from the elf’s hand.
 Antonil’s sword looped around, thrust forward, and buried deep inside flesh.
 The elf fell, gasping for air from the fatal wound.
 Blood pooled below him.
 Antonil pulled his sword free and saluted him with the blade.
 “Well fought,” he said.
 An arrow clanged against his sword and ricocheted off.

Without a word, he handed it to her.
 The picture was one she and her parents and John had posed for just days before her father had disinherited him.

I think maybe it was when I looked out the window one day and realized I'd somehow missed fall.
 Fall had always been Dad's favorite time.
 Cindi's had been spring--she hadn't minded the mud.

 I focused back in on what Mom was saying.

 Don't worry; this is just a little setback.

 Being in a different environment will do wonders for us both."

 I read more and follow the lead of Flannery O'Connor, a Christian writer of some masterpieces.

The soldiers clearly thought Harruq the more dangerous of the two, and he was more than willing to let them continue thinking that.
 “No jest,” the guard said.
 “You two are leaving this city, now.”
 “My things,” Harruq said, his voice coming out as a weak croak.
 “I don’t see anything,” said the guard, scooping down and retrieving the scattered coins Harruq had dropped.
 “In the shed,” Qurrah said.
 “That where you two live?”
 “Yes.”

Some may be tempted to market their military skills elsewhere.
 Just as the present efforts of the UN to make and keep the peace are severely constrained by the lack of a standing professional military force under its own direction, so also the prodigious efforts of the UN’s development agencies to accelerate development among member countries is hampered by a lack of well-trained, disciplined and highly organized personnel for implementation, especially in those countries with the greatest need of assistance.
 The Commission recommends that, as a complement to the establishment of an International Force for Peace, an International Force for Development be constituted, comprised of former military personnel who, after appropriate training, will work to accelerate economic development to provide food, health, literacy and jobs for all.
 A UN Peace Force and UN Development Force, functioning under a democratically restructured UN, can make a lasting contribution to achieving the major goals of the UN system.
 Conclusion
 Seven years ago the threat of nuclear war between the superpowers loomed large in the minds of people everywhere.
 The euphoria generated by the end of the Cold War led to high expectations of peace and a ‘peace dividend’ the world over.
 Yet excitement soon turned to disappointment as the full anticipated results of these magnificent accomplishments did not immediately materialize.
 Then, as attention turned to more mundane problems closer to home, the sense of relief and celebration was replaced by growing concern over the increasing prominence of other threats to international security: some of these were aggravated by the new positive developments, while others had not previously seemed so serious by comparison with the threat of nuclear annihilation.
 The end of political confrontation between East and West, the sudden conversion of authoritarian communist states into demo cratic market economies, and substantial cuts in global defence spending were accompanied by increasing political instability and ethnic violence in the many parts of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, by the horren dous loss of life due to civil and ethnic strife in several African countries, by growing concern over drugs and violent crime in the West, by the danger of nuclear terrorism resulting from potential theft of Soviet weapons, and by pressure on defence producers to compensate for reduced domestic defence budgets by increasing arms exports.

"I don't want to cause you pain.
 But I can't help it that I love you.
 And that I want you to stay here with me."
 Her body shook with sobs.
 Rick scooped her up and sat down with her on his lap.
 "Please don't cry, sweetheart," he pleaded, kissing her hair.
 He opened his mouth to tell her that she might not even be able to get back, since she'd been unsuccessful so far.
 But that would just hurt her more.
 Still, the thought calmed his own turbulent feelings.
 When her tears were exhausted, Marie rested quietly in Rick's arms.

Asking Captain Poir to send up Adapt Korin had been totally unplanned.
 He had been dreaming of killing Korin for all the 18 years that he had served in the tower.
 The Sorcerer Ravenhurr had been an immoral monster that used those around him for his own selfish desires.
 But Adapt Korin was of a more casual evil; he never passed up the opportunity to hurt those around him, physically or emotionally.
 Ravenhurr had existed in the same body for the full eighteen years of Rodregas’ service, and was hundreds of years old.
 In all his years serving in the tower Ravenhurr had only tried to hold the ceremony three times, each time abandoning the attempt due to the lack of a celestial animal.
 A celestial animal was extremely rare, but required as part of the ceremony for Ravenhurr’s next step up in power.
 In contrast, his assistant, the Adapt Korin, had been going though bodies constantly.
 Worse, he seemed to take great delight in letting people know what fate awaited them.
 Rape and torture of the victims were common occurrences with Korin.

 It was going to be seriously wind-blown later.
 I sat down next to him and I was trying to forget the dwarf’s mangled body.
 I shook and hugged myself.
 “Are you cold?” he asked, his voice full of concern.
 I just shrugged and squeezed my eyes shut.
 I saw Kojas’ glowing eyes and sword, the dwarf, his armies, the ghost girl, the dark woods and her haunting voice.

“I know you felt they were not a danger, but to walk up and take the food from two Dire Cats?

 “I bet they actually had to go in and kill it there.

 They probably dragged it out after.

I quietly entered the house, hoping to slip right into my room, but there she was, smack in the center of the sitting area, drunk as a two-day jamboree.
 She stopped me on my way through and forced me to sit, her audience.
 I watched her as she rambled.
 She had the same dull blonde hair and muddy-brown eyes as me, though my eyes were specked with green.
 After a long evening ducking her verbal jabs and listening to her theories on the Council’s secret conspiracies, I finally made it to my room.
 A flick of my fingers and light flooded the tiny space.
 I took a quick inventory: the seal on my wardrobe was intact, my drawings were still scattered across the floor, and the stash of cheese remained on the table beside my bed.
 My mother’s pendant hung from a woven leather chain above my pillow, shooting refracted beams across the bed, and I smiled as I sat beneath it.
 Scanning the pages I’d brought home from the library, I tried to find some order.
 I hadn’t even considered there might be missing pages, but I sorted what I had as best I could onto the worn comforter.

 I could only think of our lessons, of the fire in the clearing.
 It had been so obvious once Chevelle had urged me to control a stronger flame, I guessed because I had been using the power in small doses for so long.

Every weekend was filled with hours upon hours of yard work at Dino’s command.
 If we ran out of work to do, Dino would have us move a scrap woodpile from one end of the backyard to another, then back again if he wasn’t done with us.
 Sometimes Dino would stand in the backyard and direct us with a garden hose nozzle, spraying us from one chore to the next.
 Dino was sick.
 We never knew when we were going to get knocked across the room.
 We were often treated like unwanted animals.
 We wondered why this was happening to us but at the same time we wondered if the same thing was happening in the families across the street.

The school was narrower than it was long.
 I could walk around the west end, and use the closest doors on the north side, and still have plenty of time to get to my locker before Biology started.
 I was busy replaying my conversation with Brandon as I walked around the corner of the building.
 The air was already hot enough to suck the moisture out of rocks, but that wasn't the cause of the sudden rush of heat to my face.
 I didn't think I'd ever seen the boy before, but Jasmin was easily recognizable, even half-hidden amid all the intermittently-functioning cooling units that lived on this end of the building.
 I couldn't see much beyond the boy's wild red hair, but even that was enough to tell he wasn't completely comfortable.
 I wanted to turn around and go back the other way, but there was a chance that Jasmin had already seen me, and if so I couldn't afford to look like I was scared of her.
 The fact I actually was terrified she was going to snap and start trying to kill people was irrelevant.
 If I could convince her I wasn't scared, I was less likely to get hurt.
 I kept walking, not necessarily steering closer to the three-quarter wall the boy was leaning against, but also being very careful not to go out of my way to stay further away from them either.

Maybe this was somehow Karma.
 They certainly don’t have a book that can teach you how to be a good father and my own experiences as a son and a stepson had only given me insight on what not to do as a father.
 Even if this magical book did exist that could help you raise the perfect child, I assume that the chapter titled, “How to Do a Drug Bust for Your Son” would be absent.
 I knew Brandon couldn’t do this because he was too hot on the streets as a snitch.
 I pressed the issue, which was met with emphatic refusals each time.
 The officers continued to hold their ground and refused to agree to work with me.
 I pushed: “I don’t want you to work with me.
 I just want to know what you would do if I contacted you and told you that Steve was meeting me to buy one-hundred Oxys?
 What is your job responsibility in that case?” “We would do our job if someone called and informed us of a drug deal,” Officer White said.

 In fact I can feel it working at this very moment.
 God I feel good.
 Fantastic weather we’re having!
 So how was your day?
 Character 2- That was a tic-tac box wasn’t it.
 What are you trying to pull?

And then I called them all suckers.
 Art – Jim did say they almost lynched you.
 I can see why.
 Eugene – Well that just stunned them.
 The mob didn’t form until after I dropped my pants and mooned them.
 Art – I understand their annoyance, boy sometimes you don’t have much sense.
 You’re going to have to learn to control those impulses of yours.
 How did you escape?
 Eugene – That’s a longer story than the other one.
 The short of it, is that I ran until I passed out in somebody’s back yard.

He let me see his irritation for one long moment before his features melted back into their standard sternness.
 For some reason, it infuriated me, and I nearly berated him right there.
 But I remembered I was on the run.
 I remembered this strange elf in front of me.
 I decided to keep my mouth shut before I dug a deeper hole.
 An arm wrapped around my shoulder and drew me forward.
 “Introduce us, buttercup.” I grimaced.
 My companion was certainly enjoying himself.
 Chevelle held his hand out in a formal greeting.
 “Chevelle Vattier.” “Vattier, eh?” I thought I heard the stranger mutter under his breath, “Well, you can call me Bonnie Bell.” Chevelle waited unmoved for his response.

 I don’t know what stranger approaches in a better time, I know it’s Bonnie’s voice. “Let me find you one.”<eop> Delving further into the Background “Belbel Vattier, us strange elf,” Chevelle voiced his greeting just as the stranger steps

Aurelia struggled to her feet.
 The well of magic inside her was dry.
 In time, her strength would return, but she doubted the necromancer would give her a day to rest.
 She used a bit of the magic she did have left to summon her staff.
 If she were to die, she would die fighting any way she knew how.
 The man in black paused, extended his hands, and began to cast.
 He would give her no chance to strike.
 A blade stabbed his side.
 Velixar whirled, his speed far beyond any mortal.
 He stepped past Felewen’s slash and slammed a hand against her chest.

And-and the article changed.” “Changed?” “Yeah.”  He raked his fingers through his hair again.

Rachel ducked around her brother so she could see the shoes and then smiled before leaning in to whisper.
 "Mom wore those to the Ashure Day Dance, the one where she fell in love with Dad."
 I pulled back in protest, but Alec's grasp on my hand tightened just enough to stop me.
 "She wanted you to wear them.
 They were meant to be worn again tonight."
 My head was still spinning as Alec offered me his arm and led me out of the room.
 There was a limo, easily the largest vehicle I'd ever seen, waiting for us outside.
 We piled into it with plenty of room to spare.
 The bar was fully stocked, but Alec shook his head at Rachel when she made as if to reach for a drink.
 Nobody else seemed even the slightest bit interested in the prospect of alcohol.

 LH and Jess headed for one of the souliest bars in the mall, and Rachel hands me a coke on Main Street where Jess works, I was hungry and tired, hair long and pock-faced. LH greeted her with a smile and an insult, and Jess was wearing thin

It is good not to hunger for magic and be FREE!” Rodregas was, of course, curious about the Hellborn’s background but had been hesitant to ask.
 You do not want to piss off one of the Hellborn.
 Hellborn were not necessarily chaotic and sadistic beings, like actual daemons or Greater Daemons, at least unless they voluntarily chose to become one of Hell’s Chosen.
 Rodregas did not think even one of the Immortalists would choose to mess with one of Hell’s Chosen.
 Hellborn on the mortal world were welcome among the Orqui much like those of Celestial blood were among the humans and the AElves.
 The Orqui mated with Daemons and their offspring became its races noble house, just as the blood of Celestials flowed in the noble houses of Humans and AElves.
 Of course, here in the Eastern Realms true ruler ship was not by the demi-gods of the noble houses anymore but by the Immortalists and their Guild of the Celestial Path.
 Often those of Celestial blood, instead of being rulers, were prey to the Guild for their rituals.
 Rodregas decided it was now or never if he was going to ask Doi’van of his past.
 “So,” he said, “was your mother in a place of strong magic when she was pregnant with you?” He held his breath, worried that his question might be impolite.

 he said, he had no idea what his Mother was like. She was breathing like a Roman engine through her veins. The engines never screamed terrifying sounds and acted like writhinging machines though. Always sensed what they were like in the sense of most times as if his Mother was breathing in.

 You haven’t acted like a gangster in the last two minutes, you feeling sick or something?

She didn't really think she'd be able to get back on a clear, bright afternoon, but she needed to put herself closer, emotionally at least, to home.
 "Marie?"
 Rick called as he searched the house for her.
 She wasn't in the living room or kitchen.
 He went upstairs and looked in her bedroom.
 Where else could she be?

 He finally went out to the garden.
 She was way over by the pink roses, and he was surprised and dismayed to see her wearing her 1927 clothes.

 I could tell it was getting past noon because the air started to get cooler.
 I was suddenly really jealous of Emily's long robe.
 I also was getting hungry and wondered if there was any way to get food in Igneeria.
 A huge rumble startled me and I looked up at the sky.
 We were in a clearing and I could see the sky clearly.
 Dark clouds covered the sky and a rumble shook the air again.
 A single drop of water landed on my cheek.
 “Oh no,” I breathed.
 Another drop landed on my forehead and then on my chin.

Right?” “Right.” We stopped at the door to the lobby, looked back and saw Johnny’s convertible turn the corner.
 Then we hoisted our suitcases and double-timed up the road.
 We stayed at the cheapest motel, about a half-mile north.
 In the morning we hitchhiked to Fort Lauderdale.
 This was during college spring break, a sad time to be in that town if you were eighteen, on a peanut butter budget, and didn’t belong to a fraternity.

 The parties were private, the bars off limits to minors.

I don’t know.
 Maybe it was “Baby Let’s Play House.”  I remember doing “Baby Let’s Play House” at school, on the blacktop playground of Idlewild Elementary, for Mike and Mark and little Patty Grabenhorst, on whom I had the worst kind of crush.
 I think I wanted to play music, initially, to please her, to catch her attention.
 Isn’t that always the way, man, we fucking men, looking for female approval?
 Patty Grabenhorst.
 Just saying the name is like a spell to me.
 Man, I wonder where that chick is today—she must have grown up to be something.
 She moved away before high school, but, already you could see the beauty there.
 She was, um, saucy.
 Saucy at ten.

But really, I can shoot a bow with skill.” Doi’van and Imeralda looked at him doubtfully.
 “The challenge,” said Doi’van, “is not to be simply good but to be able to outshoot over one hundred other highly skilled warriors, and the targets are multiple and difficult including a moving target.
 Unfortunately, all the targets are within normal range for a human, your strength will not help.
 The good news is this is a competition of skill and they provide the bows.
 The bad news is that it is up to each competing squire to have his own equipment for the other three competitions.
 The sword and the shield competition are limited to light armor.
 You will be at a disadvantage.
 The real problem is going to the completion with the lance and the mace.
 Both have no limit to the armor; and of course, the lance is a mounted competition.

 "Yes.

And, of course, their weapons would be equally effective against his armor, going through it like butter and into his flesh if he was not fast enough.
 Depending on their sigils, they were likely to be either faster or stronger or both.
 But Rodregas’ short swords would not cut their armor.
 It put them at an extreme disadvantage.
 As the arrows flew over his head, he became aware of the other disadvantage of bows.
 They were dealing with a limited supply of arrows; once the arrows where all shot, they lost their main advantage.
 Rodregas heard the noise of the first soldier to rush from the road; he went low and swung hard.
 Rodregas hit knee high and the man trying to run by went flying head first into the dirt.
 Rodregas knew from the feel of the blow that his sword had hit armor and bounced off.
 It was an Immortal Guard.

“It seems there was some trouble in town today,” she said.
 “The elders are in an uproar.” I didn’t question any further.
 Town trouble was usually of no interest to me.
 Actually, I couldn’t think of the last time the town had had trouble… She huffed and I knew it was best to indulge her.
 “What sort of trouble?” “Apparently, Evelyn of Rothegarr came into town from the meadows at full speed wheezing and sneezing.
 She reached the village center, grabbed her throat, and fell to the ground without a breath.

She caught her breath, unable to respond.
 To her delight, she saw that he was going to kiss her.
 She closed her eyes, savoring the anticipation and then the sweetness of his lips on hers.
 When, after a few seconds, he didn't end the kiss, her heartbeat sped up.
 He'd never kissed her this long before.
 But her eyes flew open when she felt his hand slide under her skirt to squeeze her thigh.
 Panicking, she tried to push him away.
 But he pinned her against the back of the sofa, his mouth becoming rough.
 She tried to break away from him because he was kissing her so hard that her teeth were cutting into her lips; she could taste the blood.
 But he wouldn't let her go.

We rented a local storage unit and brought the furniture and clothes there but we tossed out more than we took.
 We filled nearly fifty large black garbage bags of filth and drug paraphernalia and left them for trash pickup in the alley behind the house.
 Most things of value had been stolen or pawned.
 One of these things was the expensive camera we had given him for Christmas.
 It was at the pawnshop.
 Agenda Item Two: Retrieve valuables from the pawnshop.
 The camera was sitting at a local pawnshop as collateral on a loan that expired on the very day we got there for it.
 It was the first time I had ever stepped foot in a pawnshop; it was a shit hole covered with other people’s Christmas and birthday presents.
 It was humiliating for me to be in this place and my son could not look me in the eyes the entire time we were there.

 “She also told me not to go into the shadows.” Seth stretched.

If I had to pick two groups to watch in the 70s, two that are gonna set the pace for the rest of us, it would be Carlos and the boys, and The Band.

He was making his desire clear, but the decision was hers.
 He cared for her too much, and was so determined to walk the path of righteousness and he was determined to be very careful.
 A younger man would have been in a hurry.
 But Rodregas was lost in the softness of her lips, the look of her eyes, and the beauty of her spirit.
 He wished he could make this moment last forever.
 Rodregas believed that most women did not know if they were interested until a man makes his move.
 It is something instinctive; there is a single moment when either it clicks or it does not.
 The moment held unmoving, the dice were rolling; and she responded to his kiss, but did not sink into his arms.
 She was making a hard decision.
 Rodregas felt good that she must feel something to hesitate; the moment seemed to go on forever.

 “Great,” Seth hissed under his breath.

 He rolled his eyes and shifted his gaze back to the monsters.
 “Where are they going?” “Uh, we follow them,” I said.
 “I think.” “Yup, we just follow a bunch of monsters that would like to smash us to pulp and serve us for dinner,” Seth said and started to slide down the side of the hill.

We borrowed surfboards, drove to San Onofre, and pitched a tent on the cliffs.
 Between our assaults on the surf, I told Eric stories about my exploits in Pacific Beach.
 Though he chuckled about my status as top dog, he said, “I hope you know that’s not what being Superman’s about?” “Aw, give me a little credit, will you?” I snapped, annoyed that he had seen through me.
 I got more than friendly with Gloria Valenciana, who was down from Los Angeles camping with her family.
 Her dad made her turn in early.
 When I joined Eric at our campfire, I asked him why he didn’t seem interested in girls.
 “Half of my friends are girls,” he said.

Despite getting married and having children, Thomas never settled down.
 He had been in and out of rehab for decades.
 Thomas had become very volatile and was making financial demands of us in order to see his children, our nieces and nephews, the boys’ cousins.
 His behavior was erratic and unpredictable.
 I just didn’t understand why he kept repeating the same destructive behavior.
 Now I had the same question regarding my son.
 I couldn’t help either of them.
 I had pretty much given up on Thomas, and I was afraid to give up on Brandon.
 Over the years, Thomas had conned me out of thousands of dollars.
 He had an uncanny ability to put together some huge deal making himself absurd amounts of money and then blowing it all on a high roller lifestyle followed by being completely broke and desperate and addicted to drugs again and again.

I pointed out that I waited in a parking lot for her for over an hour and she was the one who flaked.
 I described how easy it was to sell the one hundred Oxys to the other guy and that he met me exactly where I wanted and when I wanted, gave me the cash and it was a breeze!
 She asked me if I had any more and I told her I had a few but not enough to trouble with.
 I then told her that I had a refill available for ninety Oxys that was good to fill next Tuesday.
 I swear I am making this dialogue up as I go along, just to fit all the necessary criteria and to put her off until next Tuesday.
 The new prescription combined with what I already had would meet the quantity of one hundred Oxys that they wanted.
 I also wanted a solid clarification that I was only going to meet on my terms, just as I had in my fictitious deal.
 Did I mention I am in sales?
 Telling her I sold the drugs to someone else is the classic “take-away” which creates an urgency and desire to comply.
 She said they would buy the Oxys and they would meet me where I wanted.

Qurrah paused, a smile growing across his lips.
 “Tell me, did you ever sleep with an orcish woman?”
 The spirit recoiled as if struck.
 “You dare ask me if I ever committed an act so disgraceful and…”
 “Answer me!”
 The cry from Qurrah rolled over him like a horde of stampeding horses.
 All his resistance broke away, meaningless, preventing nothing.

 The words dripped out of his mouth, quiet and disgusted.

However, this time, instead of Ravenhurr, his old guard sergeant had ended up as a new powerful Immortalist.
 As the cold of the stone chilled his back Rodregas thought about his promise to the Celestial Gods that if he were able to kill Ravenhurr and live, then his new duty would be to fight the Immortalists.
 When all and everyone else had failed him over the years, only his duty had kept Rodregas alive.
 He no longer knew what to do without it.
 His back straightened and he pulled away from the wall that he had slumped against.
 Rodregas lived instead of the man whose body he now lived in.
 He had seen the tragedy of gifted person after gifted person be torn asunder by the Immortalists.
 He hated the Immortalists for their casual destruction and use of people.
 Could he now live in one of these stolen bodies, unless he had a reason?
 The Immortalists and their Guild were evil and needed to be opposed.

He'd started out making my stomach knot up simply because he was so gorgeous, but lately my insides had started jumping around for other reasons.
 I wiped away the light sheen of perspiration on the back of my neck, and wished the world was simpler.
 If only I was still in Minnesota, or anywhere other than this crazy, secretive town with its ridiculous share of gorgeous boys.
 Boys who didn't behave much at all like any other popular kids I'd ever known.
 Alec hated me, Brandon stopped by to give me a ride to school every day, and neither of them should have even realized I was alive.
 If I couldn't be at home, couldn't the universe have at least arranged for me to get involved with a nice, normal, uncomplicated, plain-looking boy, or barring that to remain safely uninterested in boys altogether?
 At the very least, someone out there should have managed to keep the air conditioning working.
 By the time English ended, I felt worse, albeit for different reasons than earlier in Biology.
 Luckily, Algebra was starting to become a real sanctuary.

Harruq did as commanded.
 When she was standing, he grabbed his blades and sheathed them.
 She leaned all her weight against him, and such close contact only deepened his guilt and anger.
 He knew she watched him, and he wiped away his tears as quickly and subtly as he could.
 “Why, Harruq?” she asked him.
 The half-orc shrugged.
 “We…‌Qurrah…‌I don’t know.”

On the other hand, there is irrefutable evidence that expanding international trade creates large numbers of jobs, even in high-wage economies.
 The real issue, therefore, is whether the overall balance favours net job creation or net job destruction for each nation and for the global economy.
 On this issue the evidence is clear.
 Protectionism reduces overall economic welfare, often hurting those with the lowest incomes.
 In the long term greater international trade, like technology, expands overall employment opportunities substantially.
 Trade also counters the tendency of prices to increase along with incomes in more developed countries.
 Living standards rise as consumers benefit from the availability of lower-priced imported consumer goods.
 One of the greatest barriers to solving the world’s employment problem is the perception that trade destroys jobs.
 As in the case of technology, the interactions are complex and must be viewed in their entirety, rather than in isolated industries.
 The global economy is not a zero sum game in which increased production by one country must necessarily result in reduced production by another.

He went from cold to hot and back again.
 In a couple of weeks he was looking much healthier and we sent him out into the world again.
 Turns out, just because I did drugs and knew people who were addicted to drugs I was still not qualified to understand how to break someone from craving the drugs that satisfy their addiction.
 Brandon seemed better and we thought we had helped him simply because we incarcerated him at home away from his peers until he had the drugs out of his system.
 In our mind, he was cured.
 Unfortunately, the problem had not been solved so easily.
 Like any good movie, this solution came too easily and too early in the drama.
 He was such a child then, easily influenced and dealing with challenges in counterproductive ways.
 He was caught being truant, being out past curfew, being with a kid who stole a wallet.
 He was involved in multiple car accidents.

He crashed to the floor, screaming in pain as one of his forearms landed hard.
 Then he felt his ankle start to burn.

 He had had enough.
 Condemnation flew through the air, its aim true.

This has prompted some economists to question the notion of a ‘natural’ rate of unemployment.
 The current high level of structural unemployment is the result of policies that can be changed.
 Every social condition is the result of current social values, attitudes and policies.
 The values, attitudes and policies underlying the present state of the US economy give highest priority to conserving the value of existing wealth, rather than creating new wealth through faster economic growth and higher rates of employment.
 The apparent obsession of central bankers supported by international financial institutions to raise interest rates in anticipation of rising prices, thereby sacrificing job growth in order to prevent even modest levels of inflation, illustrates negatively to what extent it is human choices – based on superstitious fear and a clinging to money value at the expense of human value – that prevent us from resolving this crucial problem.
 The current level of unemployment is one among several of its natural results.
 People’s jobs are a variable being manipulated in the operation of economic policy.
 Through its acceptance of government policy, society has chosen the present system and, if it chooses, can alter it in preference for another.
 The commitment to ‘jobs for all’ is also undermined by the false impression that the total employment available in society is inherently limited by the finite, material needs of the community.
 Modern economic history is witness to an ever-expanding growth in human needs to match the ever-increasing productive capacities of the post-industrial age.

 economic policy is lemming as undertaking a comprehensive programme of expensive, oppressive forms of economics that result in the total exclusion of, and from future African poverty, the unavoidable assumption that interest rates will be determined for longer than maximum by existing economic incentives when, with the conflict between the current social conditions and

 The Tun brothers did not go straight home that night.
 Harruq veered them off into the grassy hills south of Woodhaven.
 “Why do we go this way?” Qurrah asked, his arm draped around his brother.
 His sagging body seemed ready to collapse into slumber at any time.
 “I need to retrieve the swords I dropped,” Harruq said quietly.
 “I want to train with them.”
 Qurrah nodded so absently that Harruq wondered if his brother even heard him.
 They walked in silence under the beauty of the stars.
 “Hey, Qurrah?”

"Sure, Rachel tells me I'm entirely unreasonable on at least a daily basis."
 I stuck my tongue out at him, and started back through the book in search of the missing information.
 There were so many other ways I'd rather be spending our time together, but he was adamant I not fall further behind in my classes.
 I looked up to ask for a hint, and found him staring off into space.
 "Penny for your thoughts?"
 His smile was a half-hearted thing.

I could only shake my head as Ruby clapped beside me, clearly thrilled with the show.
 I thought I must have missed something.
 Grey bowed out of the circle and was replaced by the two tall, silvery elves.
 I found myself startled again; I had not seen them sitting with the group, or anywhere else.
 For some reason, it was much more eerie than the little wiry man who blinked in and out of vision.
 One of the men spoke, his tone formal.
 “We will not demonstrate their full power at this time, in fear of shorting our forces a man for mere display.” I assumed he was probably joking.
 “As you can see, they can be frightening, however, without attack.” At that, the dogs walked into the circle.
 I had not seen them either, before they were approaching their masters.
 They came forward to snarl, one regarding Ruby and one Steed, and I could only be glad it wasn’t me as their muzzles pulled back and exposed a vicious set of teeth, complete with meat-tearing fangs.

Nations will continue to arm themselves as long as that is the only effective means to ensure their security.
 What is needed is a quantum shift from the competitive security paradigm to a cooperative security system in which countries mutually and collectively agree to refrain from acts of aggression and to protect each other from such acts by any nation.
 This principle served to protect the NATO and Warsaw Pact countries in the past, but on an exclusive basis which promoted a polarization of alliances into military blocs and, most importantly, left more than one hundred countries outside the security orbit and vulnerable to proxy wars.
 It should now be restructured on a global basis as a collective security system that offers protection to all nations from external aggression.
 A whole range of new security challenges is rising to confront the global society.
 The increasing number, complexity and unpredictability of security threats cannot be managed effectively and in time without international cooperation based on a fundamental change of attitude.
 We are now at an historic crossroads: one path leads us back to a static, unstable and exclusive competitive security paradigm; the other leads to a far more stable and dynamic cooperative security paradigm inclusive of all nations and responsive to future needs and challenges.
 A global cooperative security system is needed that seeks to strengthen national security without increasing the insecurity of other states.
 It should be based on the fundamental principle that force will no longer be tolerated by the international community as a legitimate instrument of national policy.

It almost nailed him in the head.
 He dodged down and then in close and with his hands free simply grabbed the opposing squire from the top and bottom edges of his breast plate.
 He then heaved the armored man in the air, something even he could only do for a moment, and then slammed him down onto the smooth sands of the arena.
 Nordien hit with such force that his arms and legs flew like a small doll’s.
 Rodregas fell on top of the armored form, grabbed the bottom of the helmet, and ripped it off.
 Unfortunately, it was firmly secured.
 When Rodregas ripped it off he took a good section of jaw with the helm.
 Rodregas then threw the helm aside and punched the man in the face, full strength, several times.
 His first hit smashed the front of Nordien’s face.
 The second blow shattered it.

But there were flames circling his feet.
 I followed his gaze to find his opponent, and then dove.

 He threw his hands up, covering his face, screaming.
 But he did not attack me.
 As I rose back to find my next target, I saw the wolves.
 They were also not being attacked, fighting with no opposition.

Alec's hand and fingers had elongated, turning into a hairless replica of the deadly claw that'd terrified me just a few days before.
 Vincent's bulk was such that it screened Alec's movements from passersby, as those razor-sharp claws sank just the barest distance into his chest.
 Alec spoke for the first time, and the even tone of his words was a stark contrast to the winds of power that seemed almost ready to throw me across the hall.
 "You forget yourself, mutt.
 As the leader of another pack, I'm due more respect than that.
 Should you or your dominant wish to push things further, I guarantee that your heart will decorate the floor before he can come to your aid."
 Brandon stopped moving as Alec's words carried to him.
 He was probably weighing odds and tabulating the probable cost of the various courses of action available to him.

“It looks like Eric stole them,” Coach said.

We followed the creek until it turned west and we kept north, slowing to a walk.
 I tried to catch my breath.
 Steed was watching me, smiling appreciatively, and I realized I was wearing a huge grin.
 And about three pounds of mud.
 The slower pace gave me time to take everything in.
 The ground had leveled off again, clearing to open meadows of low grass and a few scattered trees.
 Large gray rocks dotted the landscape.
 There was a haziness on the horizon but as we rode it began to clear, revealing a mammoth lake ahead.
 It was a hundred times bigger than the tiny forest ponds I was used to, as smooth as glass.
 Behind it the haze thinned just enough I could see the outline of mountains.

And what comes is a reminder of something I've been told more than once.
 As I recall, the first time came at the University of San Diego.
 When I moved back to my hometown of San Diego from Chico, I left behind a tenured professorship.
 My two kids lived with me and cost plenty.
 So I started teaching all around.
 One semester, I taught nine classes at four colleges, about 90 hours a week, which left me too weary to write, or so I thought.
 My son Cody and I went to Tae Kwon Do classes twice a week.
 And I was managing Cody’s Little League team, hoping he might become a pitcher instead of a ninja.
 Probably because I didn’t sleep enough, my emotions had shut down, and every day I sensed impending doom.
 Something had to change.

 The next time the sun rise and arose and I wanted to do something, my fever twitched to sing something, and I knew what it was. It was nice to be so free, and all the time I wanted to blow a flag. And when the sunrise rose and seven in the afternoon

 The terrible poverty and such just made her desperate to get out of the country.
 Art – Well as long as she’s pretty.
 Other wise, well I can’t imagine that he has much self-confidence left.
 Karen – I’ve seen a couple of pictures, she isn’t.
 Art – Stay in Russia and have no foreseeable future, or come to the United States and marry a stranger who just happens to turn out to be a contributor to the growth of the lesbian community.
 I wonder what would happen to the poor man if she decided to go back to Russia as a lesbian.
 Karen – I don’t know, I hope it never happens to him, my family would make his life hell if they ever found out.
 Art – A good reason to stay away from them.

I considered the alternative—pierced through with arrows, blessed with a prayer—and I laughed.
 His eyes were intense as he reached to gently cup my neck, fingers resting at my spine, thumb grazing the base of my ear.
 I felt him urge me forward, and my breath caught, heart stuttering into a broken lope.
 And then Ruby was beside us from out of nowhere, her words startling me back to the cold, dull room.
 “They’re coming in.” Chevelle leaned back, his fingers brushing my collarbone when he pulled away.
 I bit my lip at the tingle that ran through me, and the corner of his mouth turned up into a different kind of smile.
 He stood to walk from the room and I stared at the stone entry, struggling to keep my thoughts from spinning out of control.
 Too much had happened.
 Too much was wrong.
 My life had flipped, twisted into some strange reflection of itself, and I couldn’t reconcile the fragments.

You’ve more chance of both having the sun fall on you, and Johnny becoming the ideal prodigy child than you have of winning the lottery.
 Art – Yes, but playing the lottery is my choice, I may not have a snow-ball’s chance in hell of winning, but I don’t have to play either.
 Now I don’t have very little control over Johnny, I wish I did, but I don’t.
 The only thing Johnny’s shaping up holds in common with winning the lottery is that the chances are slim and all I’ll ever be able to do is fantasize about it.
 Jim – If only you did win the lotto, then you could buy a nice tropical island somewhere and send Johnny to it.
 Art – If I had my own tropical paradise, you can bet that Johnny wouldn’t be the one inhabiting it.
 Karen maybe, but not Johnny.
 Being alone on an island with a beautiful woman is far more enjoyable than being there with an angry teenage son.
 The two don’t compare.
 Only a sick man would choose the other way around.

 I wish Johnny’s loved or married Mom. Maybe? I hadn’t ever heard of Mom have an affair with a man, but her baby stuff was an alternative to strum strum, nothing taught, she really as far as modern memory ‘was known as Mr. Ship?’, I

Stop, let me.
 He should be as strong as I am.
 Let me and Doi’van get in close.” She hesitated, but nodded and handed her dagger to him.
 Doi’van pounded past the two and picked Van’dret off the ground, by the front of his robes, and gave him a backhanded slap across the face.
 It was with enough power to have snapped a normal man’s neck, but Van’dret looked more startled than hurt.
 “Gag him and don’t let him move his fingers,” said Imeralda.
 Even as Doi’van nodded he slapped his open palm against Van’dret’s mouth and used his other hand to grab one of the sorcerer’s free hands.
 Rodregas grabbed the other.
 “Put him on the ground and kneel on him,” Rodregas said to Doi’van.
 The Hellborn nodded and pushed the sorcerer down on the cold stone ground.

 the others grabbed Van’s scratch on the bed and knocked him south, the door ajar and opened. They went straight into the room and kicked out the wood blocks to stick partially out. Ethan Shannon Beers, Grazasi, and Doi’van knocked the door out.

"Put me down, I mean please put me down."
 Those clear, deep eyes met mine for a second, seeming to look past the surface and all the way down to the bleeding mental gash that'd just triggered my most recent collapse.
 I was trying to marshal my arguments, but his eyes wiped my mind clean.
 I couldn't form another coherent thought until he shook his head and looked away.
 "You need to see the nurse."
 My mind hiccupped for a second.
 There should be some kind of law requiring him to hide those things.
 Sunglasses, or maybe a blindfold.

 That wasn't anything; it didn't mean anything.

I was buying an unknown amount of time while keeping Ashley and Steve on the hook.
 So while I am standing in the lot wired up, not able to call my wife, not able to go anyplace myself, some of the officers take orders for a hamburger run!
 I am now beyond irritated, as their lackadaisical attitude could equal another disappointment and a setback for the mission to get my son on with his life and out of a possible prison sentence.
 They asked me what I wanted from the nearby hamburger joint as they relayed orders to another officer via a cell phone.
 I wanted nothing!
 Eating was the last thing on my mind and my stomach was churning with every passing moment.
 I just wanted to get on with it and go home in one piece.
 It was an odd sight for me as I watched these officers chow down their burgers and sip on their drinks reminiscing about the drug deal they just finished.
 Just another day at the office, I guess.
 In a moment, my crack-berry starts to blow up with one call after the next from Ashley, wanting to know when we are doing this deal.

It didn't help.
 By the time I was done, I was clean but just as emotionally numb as before.
 At least I'd turned the water all the way to cold there at the end.
 I came out shivering, but it was a welcome change from the oppressive heat.
 Even that didn't last; it felt like I was sweating again before I even finished dressing.
 I finally pulled out my Biology book.
 A coldly rational part of me knew that however this ended up playing out, I'd still have a test on Monday, and I'd still want to pass.
 It'd be nice sometimes to make the kind of dramatic gesture that you see on movies, or read about in books.
 Instead, I was sitting here with a stupid textbook while everything else inside of me hurt in a funny, cold kind of way.
 Like it hurt so much I could only feel the edges of the pain.

He wasn’t afraid of a sword.
 The last tracker hadn’t given at broken bones, not even before the threat of certain death.
 I’d need something dreadful, a new tactic to convince him.
 A tiny snake sunning on a nearby rock caught my eye and I smiled.
 Some part of me knew what had happened before, had felt it.
 I could do it again.
 I slipped the tip of the sword down to the tracker’s leg, just above where his knee met the ground, and sliced his trousers up to the thigh to reveal bare skin.
 Drawing the snake close with magic, I took it in my hand, its thin green body writhing over my left palm, the sword grasped in my right.
 The prisoner watched me, almost smug.
 It was a small snake, its white belly confirming it was nonvenomous, its frame no thicker than my pinkie, but it would do.

“Old family recipe, you see.
 My mother left a diary.” She was thoughtful for a moment.
 “Ah, what a thing, a mother’s diary.” Ruby went silent for too long and I wondered if she would be returning to this one-sided conversation any time soon.
 Her eyes flicked back to me.
 “It was very fortunate for me she’d kept a journal, you see, for I would have no fairy knowledge without it.” I felt my brows draw together and tried to smooth my face.
 “No, don’t feel bad for me.
 With you in such a position.” I didn’t know what she meant exactly, but she continued, “And my dear brother has been there for me all along, helping me with the elf parts.” She kept talking as she leaned forward, seemingly unaware I’d not spoken a word in response.
 Not that she’d given me much opportunity.
 I contemplated whether this was her usual behavior toward strangers or if she felt we had a special motherless bond.
 She ran her finger through the substance in the canister and it came out coated in a deep, dark green that had the consistency of grease, which she smeared across the base of my eyelid.

"Yes."
 Her mother nodded.
 "When I was 17, I met a young man named Andrew.
 I was staying with my aunt on Martha's Vineyard for the summer, and his family had a cottage not far from my aunt's.
 He was a student at Harvard during the year, and he was planning to be a doctor.
 We were inseparable from the moment we met.
 We went out to dinner, went to parties, sometimes just sat quietly reading together.
 But best of all, we would walk or sit on the beach for hours talking.
 He was wonderful, and I loved him with all my heart."
 She paused, smiling as she reached out to touch a lock of Marie's hair.

 I was afraid I would remember him on my pillow with every matter the evil he was doing. I would sleep over him until I could read again, and then lay down on my side. He took all of my fantasies with him. He was a wonderful, fun, great guy. We swam at

 He chuckled, dropping another kiss on her neck.

 She returned, glancing up at him sheepishly when he opened the door for her.

He gave me a small smile.
 “I do wish you luck, miss.
 I hope you survive.” “Please help us,” I begged.
 “We need your help.” He shook his head.
 “I'm very sorry, miss, but I can't.” He gave me another smile and was gone.
 “Jazell,” I heard Emily say.
 I turned around to see her smiling at me.
 “We'll be fine.” “Emily's right,” Seth said.

He smacked away a thrust but did not attempt to counter.
 “Can you not kill me?” he asked, holding his swords out wide.
 Neither one attacked, instead holding their swords in defensive positions.
 Harruq shook his head, feeling his anger growing.
 These men did not fight with their hearts.
 They fought with their heads, and such foolishness could not be tolerated.
 “Fine, I’ll show you a real warrior,” he said.
 His muscles tensed, his legs bulged, and then he charged the two, oblivious to his own safety.
 Overwhelming any of their attacks, he was a moving mountain of muscle, dangerous and powerful.
 The meager defenses of the guards faltered.

 far enough toward them, he aimed to strike the monsters who had been trapped. Instantly, Ofla swung around right into the melee zone. The small creature fluttered his wings and glided toward the guards. The corpse shifted and seemed to add weight. While Harruq made boasts at

“Yes, the wolves attack.
 But not as weapons.

 “But—” “Okay, well, sure, you can lead an animal.
 You can turn your horse and guide him on the path, but that is simply pushing their heads and encouraging them with the click of your heels.

Qurrah nodded, his thoughts distant.
 “They’re ready for us.
 Many elves will be lurking inside the woods as they hunt for the Forest Butcher.” Again Qurrah chuckled at the name his brother had earned.
 “Will we stop for a while?” Harruq asked.
 The smaller half-orc shook his head.
 “Of course not.
 I must keep learning, increasing my strength.
 We will resume, just this time amid the darkness.”
 Harruq nodded, obviously uneasy.

So I’d teach myself, take the risk and learn the magic without guidance.
 What did I have to lose?
 The plan was formed: I’d practice until I was strong enough to return to the village.
 There was nothing holding me back.
 Nothing to do but this one thing.
 I spotted a small toad as it leapt across the clearing in a desperate attempt to escape the inferno.
 I concentrated on it, willing it to change.
 Its wide body started to swell, sides bubbling out, puffing it into a tiny green balloon.
 It did not transform into that monarch butterfly I had imagined.
 It burst, spewing entrails across the hem of my dress.

A major international commitment is needed to reverse the trends and end the famine threat in Africa.
 The region possesses considerable potential that could be converted into higher rates of growth.
 Africa has the world's largest reserve of arable land, one billion hectares, of which only 20 per cent is presently cultivated.
 Fertilizer use in sub-Saharan Africa is very low relative to other developing countries.
 Per hectare consumption averages just 13 per cent of the level in India and 3.5 per cent of the level in China.
 Recent studies indicate that the area under irrigated crops could be expanded four to five times, primarily through small, private irrigation systems.
 Improved farm systems have demonstrated that they can raise the yields of most crops in the region.
 Changes in agricultural policy can improve the efficiency in factor and output markets, raise the incentives of private small farmers, and improve technology generation and dissemination.
 Institutional reform can improve marketing and distribution services.
 Investment in infrastructure can significantly lower marketing costs.

He waited until nightfall.
 Even in the dark the elves still patrolled, carrying no torches for their keen eyes had no trouble seeing in the starlight.
 The longer he hid and watched, the more Qurrah was convinced they searched for him.
 The Neldaren troops were long gone, Harruq with them.
 He knew he was being paranoid, but the only other person they could be searching for was Velixar, and the elves were deluding themselves if they thought they could handle him.
 When a smaller patrol turned a corner and vanished, he opened the door, winked at the bloody corpse near the window, and then slipped into the night.
 The scent of mourning floated throughout the town, and he paused to enjoy the bittersweet strands of death that tugged on his heart.
 So many souls lost in battle, and even in the quiet aftermath, it was intoxicating.
 “No sleep tonight,” he said, turning back to the building that had been his shelter.
 Fire swarmed around his fingers.

 When Mom surfaced enough to notice how much weight I'd lost, she worried I was developing an eating disorder.
 She couldn't seem to understand that I hated the new me more than she did.
 Cindi was the skinny one.
 I'd tried to make myself eat enough to fill back out, but I'd had a hard time remembering meals lately.
 It was easier to just cinch my pants up a little and avoid mirrors.

The Celestial Lion was simply breathtaking; almost twice as large as the Dire Cats and even more powerfully built.
 It was not simply size that set him apart however.
 It was a way of moving, a grace that spoke of perfection.
 To look at a Celestial Beast made Rodregas wish he could write poetry like some noble in one of the high western courts; it made him struggle for words that he simply did not have.
 And what did this marvelous beast do?
 Rutted, gorged, and fell asleep ready for the slaughter.
 Rodregas could not help but shake his head at how life can show you miracles that made you want to live again, and that using the same miracle drives home the fact that there is truly no justice to existence.
 His eyes jerked back to Ravenhurr, as the sorcerer made a jerking motion, rising up from his sky tube.
 “Now,” he said and quickly repeated in his deep but smooth voice, “NOW!” Captain Poir, the leader of Ravenhurr’s guards, had stepped out of the shadows and approached the prisoners, but Rodregas stepped forward first and grabbed the half AElf maiden’s arm.
 With a quick twist of the key he removed her iron shackles but grabbed her arm hard so she could not run.

I completely abandoned myself to the sensations created by his touch.
 My nerve endings didn't know whether to classify his finger as icy cold or scorching hot, but before I could recoil in pain the sensation gave way to a tingly warmth that sank down into my center, simultaneously tightening and relaxing parts I didn't even know I had.
 My pounding heart seemed loud enough to hear from across the street.
 I opened my eyes, afraid he could somehow hear the overworked muscle, already flushing red with embarrassment, only to find a gentle smile waiting for me.
 If there was any insincerity to the expression, I was utterly unable to detect it.
 I cleared my throat, seeking to avoid the awkwardness that always followed these kinds of moments, but Brandon effortlessly defused all of that by opening my door and helping me into the car.
 "I'm sorry I wasn't around yesterday.
 Some things came up that demanded my attention."

In return Imeralda would inscribe Jordaan who was also eager for the sigil.
 Jordaan had his hand out with the palm facing up.
 At Jordaan’s direction Rodregas put his own, palm up, on top of it.
 The frog went on top and Jordaan’s other hand went on top of the frog.
 Jordaan then said, “This is going to hurt, it will feel like someone is drawing a pattern under your skin with a knife.
 If you pull away before it is done, you will mess up the pattern and it will use up your magic without adding the benefits of the sigil.” As Jordaan finished speaking he looked in Rodregas’ eyes until he nodded his understanding.
 He knew what was coming.
 He could feel Jordaan’s magic start to pour into his hands and into the frog.
 A sensation emanating from the frog began to fill his senses.
 Without Rodregas’ conscious will, his own magic raised from the core of his being.

 er his breath, Rodregas began to throw. Rodregas went into a panic. He went face first backwards and down, like two brothers, falling together. Rodregas did instinctively turn inward to attack the frog as once he fell with his ankle hurt. He dreamt there was

 “Tomorrow,” Aurelia said.
 “Early morning.”
 Harruq nodded, his whole body fidgeting.
 Now that he’d found her he wanted nothing more than to escape.

 “I’ll be waiting for you.”
 He did as commanded, and that fact disturbed him greatly.

“Get off me mutt.” I growled at his face.
 He stared down at me, debating whether or not to freeze me right away.
 That was his mistake because while he was waiting, I had brought my hunting dagger down on him.
 I stood up and shook the heavy body off.
 I didn’t even have time to breath before one of the Thrashers decided that they would like to have a taste of me.
 I decided that I didn’t want to be shredded like some old rug, so I moved out of his path.
 That was the worst mistake I made, without even realizing it.
 At the same time another Thrasher was heading in my direction, and by moving out of the way from the first one, I had placed myself in the path of the second one.

“He is a powerful Immortalist and said to be very close to Taiga.
 Some claim he is one of the few people that Taiga both respects and trusts.” “Ambassador Van’dret?” Rodregas responded thoughtfully.
 “He visited Ravenhurr about five years ago.
 Ravenhurr seemed eager to have him visit, which was unusual for him.
 Ravenhurr was usually very solitary.” “What else do you remember about their conversation or about Van’dret?” asked Imeralda of Rodregas.
 “Nothing, I was a guard who did my duty and kept my nose out of things.
 I know little of most Immortalists other than what is common knowledge.” The four talked a bit more and then split up.
 To Rodregas’ discomfort, Jordaan and Imeralda left together.
 Doi’van trailed the others and then stepped back toward Rodregas room.
 Rodregas sagged against the bed, the wound of losing Imeralda hurting more than those of his flesh.

I stood there for a moment, unsure if I should leave the room after I had so obviously interrupted or pretend I had a mission and make my way to Ruby’s room.
 I clearly wasn’t welcome there.
 Neither spoke, so I lowered my gaze to the floor, taking the shortest route to Ruby’s door and closing it hastily behind me.
 Chevelle spoke to his guest and I groaned internally, wishing I’d heard their low voices earlier.
 Asher, as Chevelle had called the man, was apparently leaving.
 It sounded as if Chevelle was trying to persuade him in some way, but the man was short and cold in his responses.
 Quiet, too.
 I imagined he didn’t want me to hear them.

 But I was so resentful toward Fannie for putting me there, I usually saw a black blob of death consuming her.

 She looked beyond me at the few inches of open floor, and I took the opportunity to bolt past her down the hall, straight out the door at full speed.
 I ran from the house, ignoring the paths; other elves would be no help to me.
 I kept running until I was certain she wasn’t coming, and then I collapsed at the edge of a meadow, breathless.

It'd be all too easy to slip into the same kind of numbness now as a refuge against everything.
 What would happen if I failed to surface?
 It'd been easier to lapse into catatonia this time than last.
 Would I reach a point where I couldn't come back?
 There'd been a time right after the accident where Mom had thought I was already there.
 I was just numb enough still to think about such things without immediately collapsing.
 Even so, I felt a pang of dizziness as my mind warned me I'd pushed it too far today.
 I found myself in the kitchen, nearly finished making enchiladas with only vague ideas of why I'd started pulling ingredients out of the fridge.
 I wasn't hungry.
 I knew I should eat something, but that hardly merited putting together anything more complicated than a sandwich.

The well-satisfied beast lay limp, sleeping, confident in his celestial power, and oblivious to his surroundings.
 He lied unbound, as required by the ceremony.
 Rodregas assumed some subtle magic had been used to influence the beast to sleep in just the right spot.
 The unlikely success of having an actual celestial animal as part of the ceremony had put Ravenhurr into an unusually good mood.
 Using one of the Dire Cats in the ceremony would have been good, but an actual Celestial animal would provide much more power.
 Rodregas’ hands clutched into a fist at his side as he could not help thinking that the last thing the world needed was for Ravenhurr, or any of the Immortalists, to acquire more power.
 Rodregas knew there was almost no opposition to the Immortalist left, but futile as it would probably be Rodregas could no longer go along with their immoral acts.
 Rodregas pulled his thoughts back to the roof.
 He would only have one shot at this.

As we talked I described to her that I had a very controlling wife and two young children at home.
 I told her this because I needed to set some restrictive boundaries; I knew I would need to work within the confines of the narcotics officers, and this would allow me to put her off, buy some time, if I needed it.
 She talked with me and continued to massage my chest as she straddled my naked body.
 She reached for my hands and placed them on her young firm breasts.
 It was an unexpected treat for “an old guy with a script”.
 I’ll let you use your imagination from there, but she finished her massage and then we both got dressed.
 The fish was in the net.
 The girl, Ashley, had taken the bait, and I felt confident that I had the deal working.
 Now I would need to go home and hope my wife’s level of understanding would allow me to be completely honest with her about what I was doing, and what I had just done.
 I knew Lisa wanted to help Brandon and we both knew my involvement would require a venture into unchartered territory but I needed her to know everything.

With the time Olga didn’t spend laboring for the sake of acquiring stuff or treating herself to luxuries, along with writing and prayer, she attended gatherings of all kinds where she could meet folks who needed her to teach, or console, or pray with them.

I was impatiently waiting when I finally saw one of the scraggly dressed officers wandered by pushing a grocery basket full of bags looking like a homeless person.
 He had an old torn jacket on with a beanie on his head.
 He was unshaven and looked the part of a vagrant.
 We had a moment of eye contact and he had no expression as if he didn’t know me at all.
 It was a slight reassurance but I still wondered where the rest of them were and how they would get to me quick if things went to Hell.
 I received another call from the officer and he had me speak so they could tune in the wire.
 He said that they needed to occasionally check the wire—from time to time I should say something to reassure them that they’d end up with a quality recording of the deal.
 The crack-berry rang and it was Ashley.
 She said her friend was reluctant to come to where I was because I was in a county where they were tough on crime and she wanted me to drive a couple of miles away and meet them at a grocery store.
 I told her again that I didn’t have much time and it was already past twenty minutes.

Only 51 nations – including only two African states, two East Asian nations and three Soviet republics – out of the current total of 184 UN members were present at its founding.
 This structure is based on political realities that no longer hold true.
 As the limitations of the League led to renewed conflagration two decades later, so the arrangements underlying the establishment of the UN contained within them the seeds of the confrontation between the superpowers and the Cold War.
 The present international system of governance is as far from being truly representative and ‘democratic’ as many erstwhile authoritarian governments that incorporated the popular adjective in the names of their parties or states.
 The UN Charter assigns primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security to the Security Council of 15 members, of whom five are permanent members with veto power over all matters.
 In no other constitution or organization founded on democratic principles is it accepted that a few members may thus invalidate the decisions of the majority.
 The General Assembly, in which all members are represented and which is headed by an elected Secretary, is only an advisory body, constituted to ‘discuss any questions relating to the maintenance of international peace and security’ and to ‘make recommendations with regard to any such questions to the state or states concerned or to the Security Council or both’.
 This authorization is restricted by the provision that in regard to any dispute or situation in which the Security Council is exercising its functions under the Charter, the General Assembly will not make any recommendations with regard to the dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.
 It may have been the wisdom of the great powers to fashion this non-democratic structure and maintain it, so long as the superpowers and the military blocs stood in firm opposition to each other, and so long as military power was a primary factor in world affairs.
 Equally, it will be wisdom now to recognize that this system is no longer justifiable or tenable.

I was showered, dressed, and ready to go ten minutes before normal, but after pulling my books together, I just sat down on the sofa.
 Today was the day.
 I hadn't consciously planned it when I went to bed, but circumstances were perfect.
 If I was wrong, Mom was not only home, judging by the noises filtering down the stairs, she was awake and only a few minutes away from coming downstairs.
 Even filled with the near certainty that Brandon's parents, and by extension him, were our secret benefactors, the next fifteen minutes were some of the longest in my life.
 When Brandon's Mustang finally appeared around the bend in the lane, I found myself smiling so hard my face was starting to hurt.
 Breathing silent but heartfelt thanks that Mom was in the shower and therefore couldn't hear the low rumble of the Mustang's engine, I slipped out the front door and skipped down the concrete steps.

Rising incomes are accompanied by a diversification in diet which generates greater demand for wheat, meat and dairy products, fish, vegetables, fruits and processed foods.
 Projections for the year 2010 anticipate a 60 per cent increase in cereal consumption in developing countries, a 52 per cent increase in meat consumption, and a 69 per cent increase in milk consumption.
 Meat consumption in China has tripled since 1978 and is expected to more than double again over the next two decades.
 Sugar consumption in developing countries is currently less than half the average of industrial nations.
 In India, sugar consumption is projected to rise from 13 kg to more than 25 kg, generating a demand for a 100 per cent increase in sugar cane production, the establishment of 300 to 400 new sugar mills in the country and the creation of 3 to 4 million new jobs in this industry alone.
 Worldwide, raising the average level of sugar consumption in developing countries could generate tens of millions of additional jobs in agriculture, industry and services.
 Viewing the future demand for food from this perspective reveals a tremendous opportunity.
 Vast sections of humanity now aspire to the higher quantity, wider variety and greater nutritional content of food once consumed only by the wealthy.
 An effort to raise nutritional standards in the developing countries nearer to the levels prevalent among industrial countries will not only eradicate hunger, but also dramatically spur economic growth, employment, and purchasing power among the rural poor, stimulating growth of production and jobs in industry and services, as well as increasing exports and imports.
 Raising the entire world population to the level of the prosperous nations would require a 72 per cent increase in total world food production, measured in terms of calories.

 that people equal to the number of cars would happen exclusively through a massive, massive mass consumption, and spectacular artificial production of nutritious fruits and grains. Reports from Princeton University on September 9 and September 15, 2011, suggest a major factor in the declining level of food production as a primary motive for hunger.

The more members, the lower the defence expenditure required by each, both because the collective force would be larger and because the number of potential adversaries would be reduced proportionately.
 The organization of a World Army, run on well-defined and transparent lines with appropriate mechanisms for control and responsiveness, would help eliminate the need for countries to maintain their own large standing armies.
 Ultimately this could enable other nations to follow the lead of Costa Rica, which abolished its military forces several decades ago.
 National Sovereignty and International Responsibility
 The recent calamities in Rwanda and Somalia following the outbreak of civil and ethnic war, and in Bosnia following the breakaway of several Yugoslav republics, demonstrate the need for substantially improving international mechanisms for war prevention, peacemaking and peace keeping, and for protection of basic human rights both between and within states.
 The effort of the international community to deal with these events has brought to the fore fundamental issues regarding national sovereignty and the responsibilities of the world community.
 The very definition and sanctity of the state have been blurred by the determination of ethnic groups in various nations to declare independence from their parent bodies, and the inability or unwillingness of national governments to maintain law and order and provide basic security for their citizens.
 The role of other states, regional organizations and international agencies in giving explicit or implicit support to these movements has further complicated the task of formulating just and practical solutions.
 These events raise questions about the rights of both nations and their citizens that have to be addressed theoretically before the role of international organizations in these affairs can be determined properly.
 Does a minority group within a country have the right to proclaim itself independent on the basis of its desire for self-governance and in defiance of the claims of the majority on the property and resources they possess?

I'd never seen her before, so there wasn't any way it could be some kind of misunderstanding.
 The secretary smoothed her blouse down over an ample stomach and smiled at me.
 I told myself I was just imagining that the smile never reached her eyes.
 She seemed to know who I was, and after identifying herself as Mrs. Pendely, proceeded to quiz me about which classes I'd been in at my last school.
 She stumbled a bit when I told her I hadn't enrolled in classes before moving.
 I didn't offer any additional information, so she tried to defuse the awkwardness by asking about electives.
 I answered numbly, picking out classes nearly at random.
 I already knew a school this size wouldn't have anything truly interesting.

Viewing the global employment situation as a whole, there are strong grounds for confidence in a brighter future.
 Resurgent Asia: The nations of East Asia, which went through rapid expansion followed by a major financial crisis, are back on the growth path.
 The Japanese economy is once again growing and creating new jobs, both at home and abroad, especially in China, which has become the largest destination for Japanese foreign investment and a key supplier base for Japanese manufactured goods.
 China’s economy continues to expand at more than eight per cent annually and India’s may soon achieve that rate of growth.
 Fuelled by very rapid expansion of automotive, financial services, IT, pharmaceuticals and telecommunications, India has emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in the world, the third largest destination for foreign investment, and a key player in IT and IT-enabled services.
 According to a recent study, by 2040 China and India will be the first and third largest economies in the world.
 Together with Russia and Brazil, they could account for a larger portion of world GDP than today’s six largest industrialized nations.

The euphoria generated by the end of the Cold War led to high expectations of peace and a ‘peace dividend’ the world over.
 Yet excitement soon turned to disappointment as the full anticipated results of these magnificent accomplishments did not immediately materialize.
 Then, as attention turned to more mundane problems closer to home, the sense of relief and celebration was replaced by growing concern over the increasing prominence of other threats to international security: some of these were aggravated by the new positive developments, while others had not previously seemed so serious by comparison with the threat of nuclear annihilation.
 The end of political confrontation between East and West, the sudden conversion of authoritarian communist states into demo cratic market economies, and substantial cuts in global defence spending were accompanied by increasing political instability and ethnic violence in the many parts of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, by the horren dous loss of life due to civil and ethnic strife in several African countries, by growing concern over drugs and violent crime in the West, by the danger of nuclear terrorism resulting from potential theft of Soviet weapons, and by pressure on defence producers to compensate for reduced domestic defence budgets by increasing arms exports.
 This surprising turn of events has led some to re-examine the incredible achievements of the period and conclude that they were either vastly overstated or, perhaps, even illusory.
 Others have come to take these achievements for granted.
 Still others have simply forgotten how much things have really changed.
 But the most important realization to be derived from these events is of the inherent defect in attempts to address the factors underlying international security in a piece meal manner.
 Over the past five years the Commission encountered reminders of this truth in virtually every field that it took up for examination.
 It is this experience that has convinced us of the need for wider perspectives and total solutions.

Rodregas watched the stool curiously as Doi’van sat to see if it would actually hold the massive weight of the Hellborn.
 His guess was that it would be crushed by the weight.
 To his surprise it held; though it gave a small groan at the weight.
 “We counted over a hundred here for the melee, all are trained warriors.
 Most should not be any problem, but at least a handful is of the blood,” Doi’van said.
 “I actually think a few are minor sigils warriors as well,” said Imeralda.
 “If they already have sigils why are they competing?” asked Doi’van.
 “She is probably right,” Rodregas said.
 “If someone who was a squire did manage to get a sigil he would be tempted to come back and earn the title and the prestige of knighthood.” “It does not matter if they are of the blood or minor sigils warriors; either way there are clearly a few who will be a challenge physically.

 She ran downstairs to repack her photography equipment, all the while yelling upstairs to verify that I'd packed all of the other essentials she was going to need.
 Almost before I'd even finished assimilating how quickly Alec had pulled everything together, Mom was backing down the lane as I waved goodbye.
 Alec appeared within thirty seconds of Mom's departure, Isaac close behind him.

This is of particular importance where regional peace and stability is at stake, as in the Middle East, over the question of access to water supplies.
 Where national environmental resources may lead to dispute and conflict, agreements should be drawn up between potential belligerents and the good offices of the UN's specialized agencies used to anticipate and avert future conflict.
 Peace and democracy can provide only the foundation for stable and productive social life, not its fulfilment.
 For that, political security has to be complemented by economic security and a blossoming of individual and cultural potentials.
 Yet here our optimism seems to flag.
 Our thoughts of the new millennium do evoke images of greater peace and stability internationally, more individual freedom and democratic rights, growing international co-operation, exciting new technologies, increasing cultural interaction.
 But they also evoke images of more people and less work – meaning fewer jobs!
 No sooner has the threat of nuclear annihilation receded, than the spectre of chronic unemployment and unrelenting poverty has risen to replace it, giving renewed justification to humanity’s deepest anxieties by transferring them to a new source of apprehension.
 In recent years, unemployment has emerged as a major cause of concern for governments around the world.
 In industrial countries, the subject evokes pessimistic prophecies of a fast-approaching future in which tens of millions of people will never find jobs, technology eliminates the need for human labour, cheap imports replace domestic jobs, welfare systems collapse under an unbearable burden, children have less economic opportunity than their parents, a widening abyss divides the rich and poor, and both markets and governments are powerless to do anything about it.

 the global average of people making 20 dollars between 2010 and 2015 threatened through the unemployment rolls, the global economy remains avid a cause for concern, but it is vital to quickly ensure cuts are enacted and of procedures that revitalise they will become once they are pencilled into place in the long

Recognition of this opportunity should be central to the strategy of industrial nations for stimulating their own job growth.
 Advancing technology: The pace of technological development continues to accelerate.
 The application of biotechnology in agriculture offers significant opportunities to raise productivity and generate higher incomes for farmers.
 Medical biotechnology is opening up the prospect of longer, healthier lives of better quality for the elderly.
 Over the next 40 years, child mortality is expected to fall to half its present level and life expectancy is projected to rise by 10 per cent.
 The shift to renewable energy sources and reduced material consumption in manufacturing can lighten the environmental burden of economic growth.
 Concerted action now could bring these benefits much sooner.
 Information superhighways: Information is a catalyst and stimulant to social development.
 The speed of information, like the speed of transportation, is a critical determinant of economic activity.
 Innovations brought about by the marriage of computers and telecommunications will make possible more, faster and better communication in developing countries at substantially lower cost through global computer networks and satellite-linked telephone systems.

The poor lack remunerative employment opportunities to generate the purchasing power needed to obtain the minimum essential requirements of food.
 In 1990, the Commission undertook a study of alternative strategies to eradicate poverty among the 300 million extremely poor in India, representing about 25 per cent of the poor worldwide, by more extensive development of commercial agriculture and agro-based industries.
 Following ICPF's third plenary meeting in Madras in October 1991, ICPF's Prosperity 2000 plan for creating 100 million jobs in India was presented to the Indian government, which incorporated the strategy in its Eighth Five Year Plan.
 The findings of that study and the strategic recommendations that emerged from it convinced us that eradicating the spectres of hunger, unemployment and poverty was possible even though these problems are present on such a massive scale in many developing countries.
 Events continued to accelerate with the break-up of the USSR later that year, followed by the collapse of the Eastern European economies in 1992.
 Simultaneously, the slowdown in trade within this region and the high cost of Germany's reunification were having an unexpected and unwelcome impact on economic recovery in the industrial countries.
 Reduced military spending, large budget deficits and declining imports from Eastern Europe slowed growth and aggravated the already acute problem of unemployment in Europe and North America.
 Rising anxiety over prospects for employment in the 1990s posed a serious threat to global trade negotiations and to the prospects for growth in the developing world.
 Examination of the rising problem of unemployment in industrial nations led us to the formulation of a comprehensive strategy for full employment in the West.
 The Commission's fourth plenary meeting in Oslo during September 1992 focused on the issues of employment and transition.

 first two years of the last review since 1989, earlier that same fall, there had been concern about a shortage of crop in the West and a famine in Lublinsk and northern Poland.

The goals of peace, prosperity and fulfilment for every human being represent formidable challenges – intellectual, attitudinal, organizational and technological.
 We cannot hope to reach such lofty achievements if we waste and squander the precious and abundant resources – mental, psychological, social and material – placed at our disposal.
 A massive reduction in emphasis on weapons production and military establishments, made possible by recent political events and demanded by the pressing unmet needs of people everywhere, represents both a great opportunity and a considerable challenge.
 The opportunity is not only further to reduce the threat of war by reducing the capacity for waging war, but also to redirect and utilize for other purposes the resources now dedicated to war making and prevention.
 The challenge is to do so at a time when rising unemployment and economic stagnation in many countries make further cuts in the size of the military unpopular domestically.
 Since 1990, the total number of military personnel worldwide has declined by two million or about six per cent.
 By 1998, a further decrease of at least two million is anticipated.
 A large proportion of these demobilized people have already joined, or will soon join, the forces of the unemployed.
 Some may be tempted to market their military skills elsewhere.
 Just as the present efforts of the UN to make and keep the peace are severely constrained by the lack of a standing professional military force under its own direction, so also the prodigious efforts of the UN’s development agencies to accelerate development among member countries is hampered by a lack of well-trained, disciplined and highly organized personnel for implementation, especially in those countries with the greatest need of assistance.

She looked at him in wonder.
 "How can it be so hot so fast?"
 He shrugged, putting the bowl back in the refrigerator.
 "We have a lot of conveniences we take for granted.
 We know what they do and don't think much about how they do it."
 He led her into the living room and picked up the remote.
 "I bet you'll like this."
 He turned on the TV.
 Marie gasped.
 "A talkie!

 Anne jumped back in the jet of reality. He told her it was turned on for a few minutes and it snapped up the wall in the living room about half an inch. As he pulled her back up to the kitchen, Marie stopped and looked at him. She was parallel him. Shining goggles

He saw her lips forming something under her breath, probably a spell, but she did not have time to execute a spell of sufficient strength in the time left her.
 Magic took too long to prepare to be useful so quickly.
 Ravenhurr stepped into the last circle; the one made entirely of what appeared to be fresh blood and of symbols made from the careful placement of living organs.
 Rodregas breathed in deeply, trying to settle himself, and almost gagged from the smells: the stench of fresh blood, the scent of fear from the prisoners, the smell of power, and other smells that he could not identify.
 Rodregas closed down on himself, “Duty,” he thought.
 “My real duty this time, focus on the next step.
 I can do this.” As Rodregas raised the club, he kept his eyes away from the AElf maiden not wanting to give himself away to anyone watching.
 “Gods,” Rodregas quietly prayed.
 “You have never answered my prayers.
 I have never had much to give you as an offering of wealth to your temples, nor have I done great deeds in your names, but if any of you hate these life-stealing Immortalists as I do, then let me know your favor.” Rodregas could not help but add a selfish plea to his desperate prayer, “If by your grace I live, then I promise you gods that I will make it my life’s duty to fight the Life Stealers.” Rodregas doubted his prayers would do any good, but if nothing else he was a practical man and when you are pushing the odds it never hurts to call in divine favor.

At the same time, the UN should integrate fact-finding into enforcement action taken under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.
 A UN Staff College should be established to develop and maintain administrative procedures for governing UN peace-keeping, peace-making and peace-enforcing operations and to train an effective corps of personnel for these purposes.
 Utilization of Defence Resources for Development and the Environment
 1.The concept of 'peace dividend' should be expanded to include manpower, educational and training capabilities, scientific and technological resources, production facilities, land and abandoned military bases that can be redeployed to combat rural and urban poverty as well as national and global environmental degradation.
 An inventory of these resources should be compiled and efforts made to identify alternative uses through the UN's specialized agencies and by national governments.
 All nations should advise the Secretary General of the human, technological and produc tive resources they are willing and able to place at the disposal of the UN.
 2.Each government should draw up an inventory of its military manpower, science, technology and other facilities which could be used to sustain the natural resource base, prevent environmental degradation and cooperate with other countries in combating regional and global threats to environmental security.
 The information should be shared with the UN Environmental Programme and the Sustain able Development Council.
 In each case it will be necessary to show how action implemented by the military will be more cost-effective than using traditional resources.
 3.A UN International Force for Development should be constituted under a democratized UN structure, consisting of demobilized military personnel and young professionals from different countries, which will be trained and equipped to promote people-centred, environmentally sound development initiatives that integrate political, social, economic and cultural factors.

The first ten, however, were too close to have hope.
 Bone shredded wings and scattered feathers.
 The elves that were alive when their horses landed died by the clawing hands of rotted flesh.
 Dieredon looped in the sky, his confidence shaken at the sight of so many of his dying friends.
 He fired arrows three at a time, his quiver never approaching empty.
 He ordered Sonowin lower, shouting out the command as another barrage of bone pelted four more elves to their deaths.
 Skimming above the darkness, Dieredon fired volley after volley behind him.
 When they were past the undead, he pulled Sonowin high into the air to observe the battlefield.
 The ranks of the undead were half of what they had been, yet still he could not see the lowered black hood he so badly needed to see.
 “Come, Sonowin, we will find him, even if it means killing every last one of his puppets.”

 that happened to them, another pair both alive and dying at this moment. It was not a threat that was up for him. In the next ten feet they would get at their target, the whien elves grounded onto their backs. “What do you think of an undead leader with

I didn’t hit him, but the surrounding trees and rocks were pulverized and I knew I had done too much.
 He stared back at me… afraid.
 I turned and ran without another word.
 Straight back to the castle.
 In these few short weeks I had started to think of it less as a home and more as a prison.
 My limited freedom made me ache for more.
 My time with this human had felt like living.
 This was wrong.
 I would return to him tomorrow, set things right.
 As I ran, I realized I was still carrying the dress with me.

I think maybe I was afraid he'd overhear and return to finish the job.
 My shoulders felt like the skin was on fire, but I knew it was just my imagination.
 His grip had been rock-hard, but he hadn't actually squeezed enough to hurt me.
 He'd shown pretty good control for someone who'd just been spanked in a debate, and obviously wanted to rip my head off.
 Turning around to return to the tutor room, I almost tripped over my own feet when I saw Britney standing just outside the closed door.
 "Are you crazy?
 First you side with Rachel against Brandon, firmly putting yourself in Alec's camp, and then you turn around and piss off Alec?"
 I really wasn't in the mood to argue with Britney, so I tried for nonchalance.
 "So now I'm not on anyone's side.
 They'll both leave me alone and I'll be fine."

 in case she had managed to change her view of me last night with the help of Cliff, I wasn't really glad I tried the argument, but I knew she was right. "So Rachel's a friend of yours", but I really didn't buy into it.
-
It was more difficult than I expected to formulate a coherent answer while fighting off the first quivering indications of another attack.
 "She's right, Rachel.
 You should be buckled in."
 I expected her to argue with him.
 No girl on the planet liked it when her older brother sided with her friends against her, but Rachel just frowned a little before scooting back so she could do up her seatbelt.
 Was she really that scared of him?
 I stole a glance at him out of the corner of my eye.
 He didn't look threatening, well, at least no more so than usual.
 Anyone with that many muscles was at least a little threatening.
 But he was just sitting there casually, driving along, seemingly without a care in the world.

We spent a good ten minutes with her trying to offer a variety of covert bribes ranging from the insignificant to things she couldn't possibly deliver.
 I kept telling her I wasn't interested and that she'd just have to do the work.
 Surprisingly enough, once she accepted that, she actually buckled down.
 It only took another ten minutes to explain the Pythagorean theory to her.
 By the time I stood up from Jackie's desk, there were only four of us left.
 Britney was staring sullenly at her book.
 I thought about going over and seeing if she needed any help, but after helping Jackie I was feeling pretty good.
 I turned and headed back to my desk, smiling at Rachel as I passed.
 "Adri, do you have a sec?"
 The deadly nickname.

“We aren’t.
 You don’t understand…” Something flickered in his eyes.
 “Besides, they are pursuing me.
 For choking the tracker.” Grey shook his head.
 “Because of me,” I argued.
 “And now you’ve killed one.” But I didn’t know who had killed him.
 Anvil had stood before the man, but any one of them could have snapped his spine.

"You're unhappy with me?"
 "No.
 I mean not really unhappy, at least not with you.
 Maybe with the situation.
 I just feel left out of everything that's going on.
 I know you don't want to get me any more deeply involved with 'dangerous information', but it really sucks sometimes."
 Alec gazed at me for several seconds, and then sighed.
 "If you would like to come watch, you may.
 Give us half an hour, and then ask Donovan to show you the way."
 I felt my face break into a huge smile, but he held a hand up to forestall my thanks.

You really would have left without realizing it was your birthday?"
 Ugh.
 No wonder I had a headache.
 My brain must have been working overtime in an effort to block out the fact I was now another year older.
 "Thanks, Mom."
 I blew out the candle, and turned to leave again, but didn't even get to take a step this time.
 "Hold on there.
 Do you always skip breakfast now?"
 Mom had somehow spontaneously developed these weird memories featuring me as a morning person.
 I personally couldn't remember a time when I'd actually liked getting up.

"So, what's going to happen now?

 Everyone seemed really worried last night."
 "I'm not sure.
 Not really.
 It won't be straightforward; nothing involving Brandon ever is.
 His pack is bigger, but we've always had the laws on our side before this..." Rachel broke off as my eyes got bigger.
 "Sorry, that's touching on some of the things I'm not supposed to tell you."
 I shrugged, pretending indifference.
 "How soon will we know if it's really bad or just a little bad?"

 turned to Rachel, finding her voice's warm tone unrequited. "What? I don't know about this? Tell anyone else why else'll it threaten to take us over the next two years? Oh myss. And Simon I'm on you, she became

He almost immediately went down again as his wounded thigh buckled under him.
 Rodregas saw the Immortal Guard who had stabbed him, a stocky man with large arms.
 He was coming in carefully, shield up, sword in position.
 Rodregas made up his mind not to underestimate him despite being severely wounded.
 Rodregas struggled back up and spread his feet wide for balance and locked his legs straight to try to keep them from buckling under him.
 He felt cold and knew he was losing blood fast.
 Rodregas knew that this was probably it.
 They had gambled and lost, there were just too many of them.
 But he did not want to die without taking out the Immortal Guards first.
 If he killed the slavers and the guards, there was a good chance that the slaves could escape.

“What should we do?” one elf shouted above the wind roaring past their ears.
 “Unleash our arrows,” Dieredon shouted back.
 “Watch for the necromancer.

 The blasphemous blanket of darkness stretched out below them like a great fog, filled with bobbing heads of Velixar’s army.
 In that chaotic mass, Dieredon knew the man in black would remain well hidden.
 Not until enough of the undead had been massacred.
 He readied his bow, his strong legs the only thing holding him to Sonowin.
 Three arrows pressed against the string of the bow, their tips dipped in holy water.
 His quiver, as was the quiver of every elf flying alongside him, contained water given to them by their clerics of Celestia.

 Aurelia seemed impressed enough with his progress, and they soon began working on simple words further into the book.
 “Why does your brother speak so strangely,” she asked once they were done, trying to broach the subject casually.
 She sat stretched out on the grass, her legs crossed and her weight leaning back on her arms.

He always apologized for shouting at her, but that hadn't stopped him from shouting at her again.
 He'd apologized for hurting her arm, but that hadn't stopped him from hurting her with his kiss.
 Would her life with him be like that?

 She was still wrestling with that question when she realized that the fog had lifted and she was still in 2011.
 Dejected, she went back to Rick.

 He stood up, taking her hands.
 "I'm sorry, Marie."
 He hugged her, murmuring, "We won't give up.

One second Brandon was a human, the next he was a huge monstrosity, a thing that normally dwelt in the bottom, most primitive parts of the mind, venturing out only to star prominently in nightmares.
 The rush of power beat back at our entire pack.
 If it'd been a physical wind it would've knocked me over.
 Intangible or not, it still staggered me and only my grip on Jasmin and Dom kept me from dropping to my knees.
 Alec stood motionless for a pair of seconds, and then seemed to explode and melt back into himself.
 I blinked, and his human body had been replaced with the hybrid form that'd saved my life once before.
 Only this time he wasn't fighting wolves, he was fighting another hybrid, and Brandon towered over him.
 There was another ripple of movement on the other side of the light.
 Jasmin and Dom both pulled away from me, joining the other three, facing outward in preparation for the inevitable attack.
 Vincent's dark form inched slightly closer, but Brandon's growl froze his henchman in place.

My hands trembled and I tightened them into fists.
 He was my watcher; he must have felt he needed to fulfill his duties, to keep his honor.
 He would finish our journey and return me to the village.
 “Freya.” He said my name as if it were tearing at him and my chest ached.
 “You don’t understand.” His eyes closed for a long moment before they found me again.
 “You can’t submit to Grand Council.
 You can never submit.” He was right, I didn’t understand.
 Did he intend to return me to the village, to High Council?
 To keep me safe from the others?

Maybe it was about something else.

 A guard approached me.
 I had been drifting again, lost in thought.
 What had they said?
 The council leaders were focused on the pendant at my chest, where it lay exposed against my skin in the V of the low cut gown.
 They had ordered the guard to remove it.
 I didn’t understand why they would want my mother’s pendant, but I knew not to ask.

Most Friday afternoon sessions were pretty sparsely attended.
 Today was no different, which was a good thing since I probably wouldn't have done a very good job of explaining anything.
 Mrs. Campbell shut everything down before my shift started, and sent me home with a concerned look in her eye.
 Rachel skipped over to my table while I was still trying to get my books put away.
 "Guess what.
 I'm bringing pizza on the bus so we'll have something to eat on the way to Les Misérables.
 I can't wait.
 My first time going to Les Misérables, and my first road trip on a bus."
 "You've never actually been on a school bus before, have you?"
 Rachel blushed a little bit.

Its value depends on what we human beings make of it.
 Changing Demographic Profile of the West: Demographic studies indicate that steep declines in the growth of population in Europe, Japan and USA will create acute labour shortages and unprecedented long-term demand for migration of foreign workers or transplantation of work to developing countries.
 UN and other studies estimate that Europe would have to accept 150 million new immigrants over the next 25 years in order to maintain the present levels of working population and Japan would need to admit 600,000 immigrants annually for the next 50 years in order to maintain the size of its working population at the 1995 level.
 The US labour force is projected to stop growing by 2013.
 These findings support the view of the India Vision 2020 report that “This trend will further accelerate the outsourcing of production of goods and services to locations where infrastructure, ease of doing business, quality, costs and availability of labour are most attractive, which will be beneficial for many labour surplus countries like India.”
 Expanding World Trade: Trade is playing an increasing role in the economic growth of developing countries.
 Economic integration with the global economy has become a compelling necessity for every country.
 The share of trade in global GDP rose from 12 per cent in 1970 to 29 per cent in 2001.
 While the effects of expanding world trade on employment are complex and can lead to displacement of workers and destruction of jobs in some cases, available evidence strongly indicates that the overall impact of freer trade on the global economy will be to promote significantly faster growth of employment opportunities.
 The emerging liberalization of textile trade in 2005 is an example of the potential positive impact of freer trade.

Instead, pillars of soft light reached up to the sky, swaying slowly back and forth with the wind, creaking in a rhythm I'd known by heart since I was seven.
 I felt tears collecting in the corners of my eyes as I reached out and touched the nearest tree.
 It was as if the world I'd known my entire life had been simply a moldy cover designed to hide the true nature of my surroundings.
 Now the mask was gone and I was immersed in vivid colors, living lights, and a sense of harmony so strong it nearly overwhelmed me.
 It was impossible to say for certain how long I sat looking at the gentle motion of the tree branches, marveling at the way things made up of light could still cast shadows when silhouetted by the harsher light of the sun.
 Only somehow the sun had disappeared, replaced by the paler, colder light of the moon.
 The trees were still graceful strands of light, but the breeze had changed to a harsh thing, one carrying new scents that somehow represented danger.
 Something inside me forced my limbs into motion.
 I was running before the first howl tore through the night.
 I was moving unimaginably fast, jumping fallen trees and bounding over other obstacles which even my improved vision struggled to make out in time for me to avoid them.

He was already talking.
 "...wanted to talk to you about what happened today."
 Part of me wanted to wait and see what he was going to say, to lose myself in what was sure to be a very convincing lie designed to make him look good, and me feel like I was on heroin for however long he favored me with his presence.
 Luckily that idealistic, stupid part of me had seen too many girls get used by smooth-talking boys.
 I interrupted right away.
 "You mean when your sister nearly got beaten by that whore, and you not only didn't do anything, you stopped your friends from doing anything either."
 Alec flinched a little.
 I was a little surprised by how satisfying it was to have him, a demigod, on the run, but I didn't let it slow me down.
 "The fact that I, a little waif from out of town, could defuse the situation and save Rachel no doubt sticks in your craw, which explains why you're lurking around out here waiting to talk to me.
 Because only then can you fabricate some reason for why everything had to go down the way it did, and thereby save face!"

At the end of the Cold War, the organization needs to be re-founded, and restructured according to democratic principles, to give a more active role and more equitable representation to people of all nations.
 To deem such considerations unrealistic given the present alignment of power in the world is a short-sighted view.
 It ignores the incredible speed and scope of changes that have radically transformed international relations over the past half decade.
 It assumes that the present system has the backing of the international community and that it can and will sustain itself regardless of whatever steps we may contemplate.
 A fundamental change in structure is essential and inevitable.
 The break-up of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War have resulted in the demise of the bipolar system which dominated international relations after 1945.
 The United States is now recognized as the sole superpower and the primary determinant of actions by the UN Security Council.
 But neither America’s culture nor its historical economic and political development and present outlook will permit it to take on the extraordinary responsibilities and overseas commitments which fulfilment of this role necessitates, as its reluctance to get involved in Bosnia and Rwanda, and its quick withdrawal from Somalia illustrate.
 Indeed, no one nation can or should assume such responsibilities on behalf of the whole world.
 The rapid shift of Eastern European and former Soviet republics to radically different political and economic systems demonstrates that changes of even greater magnitude than this can be brought about rapidly.

I had seen the reflection in the water, had known my hair was dark, my eyes a strange shade of green.
 But as I gazed at the woman in my reflection, I could not reconcile the two.
 The dark silhouette, her figure emphasized by fitted clothes, black cape draped behind her—this woman was breathtaking.
 I moved closer to examine her, nearly reaching out to touch the windblown sable hair.
 Her eyes—my eyes—were dark.
 That muddy fog was gone now and under my black lashes waited deep emerald jewels, flecked with the darkest of browns.
 Chevelle had been right, this did suit me.
 The image in the mirror was stunning.
 It felt odd to marvel over my own reflection, but I couldn’t pretend I didn’t like it.
 The changes were still unnerving though, and I tried to remember what I looked like in my oldest memories, to see before, to see my mother’s face.

His quiver, as was the quiver of every elf flying alongside him, contained water given to them by their clerics of Celestia.
 When their arrows bit into dead flesh, it would be like fire on a dry leaf.
 “Let no life lost this night be in vain!” Dieredon cried as they descended like a white river, raining arrows into the darkness.
 More than two hundred moving forms halted after that one pass, but a thousand more swayed in their sick, distracting dance.
 “One free pass,” Velixar said, observing the flight of elves as they swarmed overhead.
 They banked around, still in perfect formation, and then dove again.
 “Kill them now!” he ordered, his fingers crooking into strange shapes.

Common security against transnational threats and common prosperity for all humankind cannot be based on a 250-year-old concept of nation sovereignty.
 Over the last half century, national sovereignty has been maturing into international sovereignty.
 As the evolution of the international community proceeds towards the establishment of an effective system of world governance in one form or another, the collective rights of the international community of nations must inevitably come to be regarded as another inalienable truth, alongside individual human rights and the rights of each nation.
 The right of the nation state to self-determination has to accommodate the rights of other nations and the common shared rights of every human being.
 This approach establishes criteria for determining when claims of national sovereignty must be ignored.
 Every right is accompanied by a responsibility.
 A government that fosters external aggression or cannot contain domestic violence and civil strife, that cannot create conditions in which its people can feed themselves or even receive outside assistance, fails the test of sovereignty.
 Under these circumstances, the international community, through the UN, should have the right and accept the responsi bility to intervene appropriately.
 The need of the hour is not to undermine the legitimate right of nations to self-determination, but rather to protect that right by more clearly demarcating its legitimate boundaries against the highly visible challenges being posed by forces of disintegration and fragmentation from within.
 The current tendency for states to fragment along ethnic lines cannot be handled by any abstract principle of international law.

The blade was in one hand, the decorative scabbard in the other.
 “He was a skilled swordsman,” Qurrah said.
 “He was also arrogant.
 I would expect such a blade from one like him.”
 Harruq shrugged.
 “If I didn’t have my own two swords, I’d use it.”
 The half-orc cut the blade through the air a few times and then sheathed it.
 He turned the weapon over in his hands, marveling at the swimming colors of dark green and black.
 He paused when he found a name written in gold near the hilt.
 “Tun’del,” Harruq read aloud, slowly and carefully.

He grabbed the blade and flung it out of the man's arms.
 He roared angrily and threw his sword down on Seth, who raised his up to block it.
 Seth pushed back, but I could see him shaking.
 Right when I thought he was winning, my mouth dropped open.
 Time seemed to slow as one of the other faery guys ran over to Seth and the one he was locked with.
 The faery raised one of the hilts of his sword and brought it down on Seth.
 It collided with his head and Seth dropped his sword.
 He crumpled to ground and didn't move.
 “Seth!” I screamed.
 He didn't move and one of the faery men reached down to grab him but I screeched, “Leave him alone!” and sent an arrow into the guy's neck.

“What will they do if I can’t protect myself?” His face was grim.
 He didn’t reply and I suddenly didn’t want him to.
 We settled onto the floor of the small den, our backs against the wall, the rock overhang blocking the light of the moon.
 “That is my flame,” Chevelle said, “try to extinguish it.” And my training began.
 Chapter Nine Ruby
 Early the next morning, even before first light, Chevelle woke me for training.
 Gone were the games we had played.
 These lessons were intense and stressful.
 I’d been unable to generate magic on demand so he’d started lunging at me with weapons, sticks, fire, forcing me to respond to protect myself.
 After each attack, he would come right back at me and if I tried to repeat a tactic for defense, he would overpower my magic and push me to find a new maneuver.

Cindi and I had spent hours teasing it with pieces of string, watching its tiny head dart back and forth from one to the other as it tried to decide whether to pounce on them, or dart away and hide under the bed.
 It'd been really amusing when it had been a half-pound kitten, but the thought of having a two-hundred-plus pound wolf attacking me because I'd triggered some kind of fight or flight instinct wasn't so funny.

 Alec laughed.

 I procrastinated.

That meant they were of great power or talent.
 The prisoners were too dangerous to release, after Ravenhurr had so pissed them off by their imprisonment.
 But people did not question the order of the sorcerer and master of Raven Keep, so it should work.
 He dared not stay longer than he had to; Rodregas did not believe that he could fool Ravenhurr’s guards and servants for long.
 Ravenhurr was a powerful sorcerer who used magic quite casually; it would become quite obvious that Rodregas did not know how to use magic anywhere near Ravenhurr’s level.
 As soon as the keep emptied out for the birthday celebration he would make his escape.
 If he missed this opportunity he was not sure when he could try again.
 It was very rare for an Immortalist to leave his tower, and if he were behaving oddly, the guild would send someone to check on him soon.
 They were careful in their control of the kingdom.
 For a while Rodregas just leaned against the cold stone wall.

Unfortunately for the boy, his blow seemed to come at Rodregas slowly.
 Rodregas easily dodged as he landed a strong blow to his opponent’s chest.
 Rodregas was used to sparring with Doi’van and was surprised when his opponent went flying into the line of contestants and did not get back up.
 Rodregas waited a moment and then looked at the knight who stood outside the match.
 The knight did not look as surprised at the quickness of the match as Rodregas.
 He simply nodded toward Rodregas.
 Rodregas left the square and the knight sent the next two in.
 By mid morning Rodregas had cleared out his square without major effort.
 He noticed that all the other squares were still going on.
 His matches had ended faster than the others.

It was the late fifties and a pregnant teenager was an embarrassment.
 Shame followed the couple wherever they went.
 Thomas Richard was born on a cold December day to parents who were children themselves.
 I followed just 13 months later, and another brother was born 14 months later and died almost immediately after his birth.
 My mother at 20 years old had two toddlers and had to accept the death of her third baby.
 Years later, I returned to this town and located the home we first shared.
 The home, which had since been converted into a one car garage, still had the old front door located next to a single car garage door that had been put in place of what was once the front window.
 It seemed impossible that it could have ever have been anything but a garage.

I wondered where I would be kept as a captive, if there would be windows, if I was unfit for public view.
 Chevelle picked up speed after we passed through the more difficult part of the trail and then we rode fast the rest of the day.
 I struggled to keep up.
 I was sure I knew the cause of his hurry.
 He’d decided he wanted to get this journey over with, end it and return me to the council for punishment, to be done with me.
 We rode long into the evening, well past sunset, and I began to wonder if he would stop at all.
 I was contemplating possible ways to sleep on a horse when he finally stopped.
 We were riding through a small pass, the moonlight barely lighting our way, and Chevelle’s horse disappeared.
 My head swiveled, searching for any sign of them, and then my own horse turned beneath an overhang and stopped in a cavern so dark I hadn’t seen it until we were there.
 Chevelle tossed out a small flame, giving us enough light to dismount.

I writhed in agony.
 Nothing they did would help.
 I could not control my magic; it shattered most of the things on the nearby table and twice caught the bedding afire.
 The elders were frantic, which only frightened me more.
 I had never seen them agitated.
 This carried on for hours.

 Wuthering Heights wasn't ever going to be my favorite book, but Mr. Whethers had made the characters more real in the last few days and I was actually excited to see what he had in store next.
 Unfortunately, Mr. Whethers wasn't there.
 The substitute teacher sitting at his desk didn't even take roll; he just shut the door, told us to keep it down, and flipped open a magazine.
 While I was sitting at my desk wondering what to do with the next hour of my life, something I'd read in the physics book suddenly clicked.
 In a perfect world I would've been left in peace to finish reasoning out the answer.

 He took her wrist.

 His arms went around her when she settled down beside him.
 She sighed and was instantly asleep.

Despite my disbelief, I somehow managed to act quickly, stashing the papers in my shirt before attempting a casual exit to read them at home.
 I made it out of the library and almost to the gate when I noticed a dark figure behind Virden Day’s tree.
 It was Chevelle.
 He was speaking with Virden when he turned his head slowly toward me… and I was staring into his eyes again.
 Oh, give me a break; he’s halfway across the village from you.
 But I was staring.
 Despite my resolve, color rose to my cheeks once more as I turned away.
 I couldn’t understand why he was affecting me this way.
 The pages stuffed in my shirt felt like fire against my skin.

 We had been giving him regular drug tests, which showed levels of positive, and that line had been starting to drop.
 It seemed to be leaving his system— it took a while to be completely clean.
 But at some point during the intervention, in between the crying and the lying, it occurred to me that this boy didn’t look like he was suffering the effects of withdrawals.
 His symptoms seemed to be suddenly better and his detox wasn’t as severe as we thought it would be or as bad as it had been the first time years before.
 And I cocked my head and listened more carefully to his lies— the lies which I suddenly realized were consistent with his past behavior when he was high.
 Stop the presses!

 The two took to the air and joined the other survivors.
 They did not try to locate their dead among the hundreds of other rotting bodies.
 Instead, a few elves flew low and scattered firestones, small pebbles that burst into flame upon landing.

 When she didn't pull away, he repeated the feather-light touch.
 He felt her breath, the quivering of her lips.
 He kissed the corner of her mouth and nuzzled her cheek.
 Gathering her closer, he began taking her lips in one soft kiss after another.

Rodregas started to get up, but quickly decided it was smarter to stay lying down for now.
 “Where did we finish?” he asked.
 “Actually we did pretty good.
 There were more than a few that cannot go on, even if you had won.
 You finished eighth overall in the tournament, with a second place white ribbon for the joust.
 Several of those who would now be higher are too injured to continue.
 So you are now in fourth place overall.

I had played around on an old box guitar Dad brought home—I think it was a gift from Mr. Delisi actually.
 We had to sort of sneak it into the house (laughs) but it was old and didn’t sound very good, though I had fun trying to pick out Carter Family or Pete Seeger songs on it.
 Or blues chords.
 And, of course, I had a Mel Bay instructional book.
 I think Dad heard me, saw that I was progressing beyond his wildest dreams and bought me that electric guitar, without asking Mom, without thinking it was her business, you know?
 He saw that I was really good, that I could be something special.
 So he bought me this electric—it was a Hofner Futurama, if you can believe it.
 My old man…I don’t know what happened to that guitar.
 Shit.
 That was a beauty.

 Rodregas waited as Doi’van touched the handle but stopped him before he opened it.
 “Do you see anything?” he asked.
 Imeralda eyes opened wide when Doi’van fully opened the doors and revealed the room.
 It was in style identical to the first room of the Celestial Beasts except instead of great beasts on pedestals, it held crouching daemons in pits.

Not merely a different personality, but different altogether.

I mean, if they told you that you had the job they can't take it away, can they?"
 Mom rooted around in a half empty box until she found some tissues, it wasn't the first one she'd been through this afternoon.
 "I didn't think so, but Mr. Peters claims there was never any contract signed and I can't find our copy in any of the boxes."
 "Mom, what are we going to do?
 Where will we go if they kick us out?"
 She smoothed my hair back from my face.

 I'm sure everything will be okay.
 I was just over-reacting.

 He was fierce and wore a long scar across his brow that touched his cheek.
 He kept his hair cropped short, not wanting to hide any part of the damage.

Brandon was physically and mentally a different person.
 We would later joke that Brandon was so different from the person who we had known as a son these last few years that we should re-name him.
 Brandon was accepted to the internship program which would last another 3 months.
 First, he returned home for a week to help go through his belongings that we had placed in storage.
 We ended up throwing away 90% of this junk, as he really didn’t want much of it anyway.
 Rummaging through his old belongings was a grim reminder of his former life.
 Brandon eagerly cleansed himself of almost everything and was resolved to start fresh.
 His stay at Narconon had also exposed him to a minimalist lifestyle completely unlike his prior existence.
 He had learned he didn’t need “things” to prove anything to anybody.
 His ex-girlfriend, Tiffanie, met us at the storage unit to claim her belongings.

“Come now, you’ll have to do better than that.” She kept circling.
 “Let me try harder.” She flicked her wrist, and the end of her whip caught my ankle so fast I hadn’t even realized it was moving.

 It hurt.
 The pain stole the heat from my anger, and I struggled to stand.

This results in higher incomes for its workers and makes their products more affordable in other countries, which in turn raises standards of living abroad.
 The resultant rise in real incomes domestically and overseas stimulates demand for more of these products as well as for other products that can be produced locally or imported from overseas.
 Trade also tends to raise the quality of jobs in an economy.
 It forces higher-wage countries and their workers to specialize in technology-intensive and skill-intensive occupations that pay higher wages.
 At the same time, it also raises the wages of less-skilled jobs in low-wage countries by increasing the demand for workers to produce for overseas markets.
 The problem in the more developed countries is that the demand for low-skilled jobs declines and the gap in wages between skilled and unskilled jobs tends to increase, resulting in a decline in incomes and employment opportunities for lower levels of the population in these countries.
 This is a natural, healthy process of social development in which different sectors serve as engines for growth at different stages.
 The upward job displacement that earlier shifted job opportunities from agriculture to industry now shifts them to higher-skilled jobs in manufacturing and services.
 The negative side-effects of this process on some sections of the population alert us to areas where society must make special efforts to speed their development.
 As in the case of technology, research is needed to document this complex process across industries, between countries and over time.

 , the researchers need to facilitate the development of technical and scientific inputs that include case studies, statistics, overviews and analyses of expanding patterns and to discover changes in what is specifically missing. So we will give our technical inputs four pages into this questionnaire with the base rules for incorporating it into our

 Johnny – I just meant that, I’d rather be hit by a speeding train than to talk to the king of idiots again.
 Liz – Why didn’t you just say that in more simple terms in the first place?
 No need to lead us on.
 We got all excited about knowing our future, and here you go and do that.

 Jim – Being chased by a torch wielding mob?
 Well it’s a lot like hide and seak…
 Johnny – No, the ‘improvising’ you claim you do.
 How is acting like a retarded lunatic  in front of a crowd fun?

 Usually at the very least you get a laugh.

It took less than half a second for him to figure out who I was talking about.
 "They don't hate you.
 A few of them are scared almost senseless, but nobody hates you."
 "They were willing to kill me.
 They wanted to trade me back to Brandon."
 It came out as something less than a whisper, but apparently Alec's hearing was acute enough to catch that too.
 Alec drew me close, heedless of the open door and the twenty staring kids.
 He placed the side of his face against mine and whispered into my ear.
 "I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
 If there's a way to keep you safe I'll find it."

“I went and chatted with him,” she continued “and he hates the Immortalists, but is rather unpleasant and needs to take a bath.
 But he is also clearly very honorable.
 And when I asked him why he wanted to be a knight…” she paused then added, “he said that some ‘Infernally damned knights’ have to stand up and fight.” “So you think he is a good man?” Rodregas asked.
 “I think Geriodon is a ‘holier than thou’ stick in the mud, who needs to learn to bathe and not mumble when he speaks.
 And yes, he is probably one of the only men here that actually deserves knighthood.” Rodregas nodded and said, “What about Nordien?” “Nordien is the polar opposite to Geriodon; smooth and friendly… and tried to have sex with me within our first conversation, which was also the only decent thing he said during our conversation.
 He seems to really dislike Geriodon and Karun.
 He comes from a strong blood line and rich family and feels he should already be a knight and not be forced to be in the tournament.” “So, why is Nordien in the tournament and not knighted?” Rodregas asked.
 “From what I can gather, Nordien is very friendly with the Immortalists, including the Ambassador Van’dret, and most people believe that he only wants to be knighted so that he can then leave the knighthood and join the Immortal Guard.” Rodregas nodded.
 That was not too surprising; since such ex-knights are usually made officers.
 Greater sigils were much more rare in the Guard than the knighthood, not to mention the officers of the Immortal Guard lived in much nicer style than the knighthood.

The thought of lying helpless with her in the same room sent shivers of cold sliding down me.
 I couldn't see, so I reached out, blindly trying to find the phone before Rachel could dial Alec.
 My questing hand finally found the tiny, hard-plastic package, and I grabbed on with all of my fading strength.
 The darkness was still beckoning, but alternating images of Jasmin and Alec flashed before my eyes.
 I was so confused that I couldn't make sense of the flood of emotions that accompanied the pictures, other than the fact that terror came to the forefront as they sped up.
 Faster and faster the two figures changed places, and then they disappeared.
 It was like my mind was a computer that'd overheated and had to reboot.
 I opened my eyes and met Rachel's worried gaze.
 My pulse was still elevated, and I was breathing too hard.

Alec's cameo role in my last two had apparently been sufficient to tie him inseparably to all of the special dreams, and as silly as it was, I didn't want to see Alec right now.
 Not even just in my dreams.
 Maybe there really wasn't any kind of link between him and the dreams.
 Maybe I'd have one of them tonight without him making any kind of appearance.
 I sincerely hoped not, but I'd rather not have them right now than see the disdain he'd displayed earlier in the day.
 ** The next morning played out essentially the same as the day before.
 I awoke to an empty house, and then hurried to get ready and down to the bus stop so I wouldn't be stranded if nobody else showed up to give me a ride into school.
 Brandon smiled as he pulled up and found me patiently waiting for the school bus.
 "One of these days you're going to go ahead and wait for me at your house, and then I'll know you finally trust me."
 I didn't feel much like playful banter, but I marshaled a semi-convincing smile and gave it my best go.

“Or half-orc, whatever you are.
 I can only keep them like this for a little while.”
 Both men glared at Harruq as he stood, but while their mouths moved and their chests heaved neither produced a sound.
 The half-orc looked to the woman shrouded in the shadows cast by the fallen torch of the patrolmen.
 “I said move along,” she said.
 “I need to give these men a talking to.”
 “I’m going,” Harruq grumbled before staggering down the alley.
 He did not attempt either stealth or silence.
 Seething, he limped back to Qurrah and their home.

 “The penguins?” “Does that really matter?” she hissed.

 Usually Seth did all the talking while Jason stood watching but now Jason was doing all the talking and Seth was the one watching.
 He stood there and seemed unmoved from being soaked by my water gun.
 His face was blank and he was staring at nothing.
 It wasn’t the Seth I was friends with.
 While Emily and Jason were bickering I said, “Seth?” Seth didn’t answer.

 Reluctantly he took the ring, pocketing it as he watched her rise and head for the bathroom.

 Eventually she'd accept that her life was here now.
 She'd have to accept it.

On this trip, I have attempted to deepen my understanding of the word “adore.” Now I’m trying to do the same with some words in John’s admonition, because I feel my mind or the Spirit telling me that everything we need to know to live in goodness and beauty may be contained in those few lines.
 John tells us to “believe in” the name of the Son.
 While at a glance this could be taken to mean we should simply believe that Jesus existed, it doesn’t.
 Because “believe in” denotes more than credulity.
 “Believe in” means to fully trust.
 And here we’re not called to believe in “Him” but to believe in His name.
 As “name” in the Biblical context refers to character, John is calling us to fully trust in the character of Jesus Christ.
 When we believe in, fully trust certain people, if we have any sense, we will follow their example and not only take what advice they offer but actively seek every piece of wisdom we can wrest out of them.
 If I want to become a baseball star, I should look for a coach or mentor whose character and lessons I can believe in.
 If I believe in Mother Teresa, I should read about her and talk to those who knew her and attend to whatever I learn.

I remembered being trapped underwater just before waking, but I hadn’t been drowning.
 It wasn’t a dream.
 I was horrified as more of the memory returned.
 The cloaks who had surrounded my mother, killed her, had been circling me.
 I knew they’d intended to destroy me, too, though I couldn’t see why.
 Chevelle had held me, pulled me into the water.
 He had tried to keep them from finding me as they attacked, tried to keep me from calling out to her.
 The look of fear, the look of sympathy.
 He’d held me back to save me.
 Tears streamed down my face and my body began to release from the dead weight.

"So there's no way you can avoid fighting him?"
 Alec's smile was more bittersweet than normal.
 "No, but it's not too late to save you.
 I can have you on a flight to Paris tonight.
 It's the only way to guarantee your safety."
 I shook my head.
 "I'm not leaving.
 I believe you when you say my going back to Brandon won't solve anything, but I'm not going to run away and leave you all to deal with the mess I created.
 I wish you'd stop asking me to."
 His gaze was long and steady, but finally he nodded.

 Okay. But it wasn't to say more. "You can keep it all together without me, you even need to wear your own jacket, shirts, pjs and shorts. There's an insurance provision that you all have agreed to on your own to protect or assist anyone

“I agree, I cherish the time we have had together, but you must walk your own path.
 The Grimoires and Mithril chain and bow are yours to keep, my gifts to you.
 Your gifts to me are far greater.” “So where do you go now?” asked Imeralda.
 “You can’t look for slavers on the road; they will be reinforced after the one caravan goes missing.” Rodregas nodded.
 His thoughts had traveled in a similar direction.
 “I have been thinking about what you said about it making sense for me to get a greater sigil.
 I have more magic than I need.
 There is only one other group besides the Guild that has is allowed to give sigils, the Knights of the Soaring Heavens; from who the Gods choose their champions.” Imeralda and Doi’van had both become quite intrigued by what Rodregas was hinting at.
 He continued, “I was a squire in the Knighthood who was never raised.
 As you probably know most squires are not raised, only those of the most noble blood and those of greatest talent in both magic and the arts of a warrior.

“Glad you approve,” Qurrah said.
 They ate in silence until only bones remained, which Qurrah then tucked away in a pouch.
 Harruq relaxed and enjoyed the heat while his brother tightened his robe and leaned toward the fire.
 “Things are more dangerous now, aren’t they?” Harruq asked after a pause.
 Qurrah nodded, his thoughts distant.
 “They’re ready for us.
 Many elves will be lurking inside the woods as they hunt for the Forest Butcher.” Again Qurrah chuckled at the name his brother had earned.
 “Will we stop for a while?” Harruq asked.
 The smaller half-orc shook his head.
 “Of course not.

As he turned the corner, the twang of bowstrings filled the air.
 Three arrows hit his chest, barely puncturing his armor.
 He bellowed, furious.
 All three elves were in the center of the street, away from cover or protection.
 They would die, all of them.
 The archers fired another volley as if not surprised the first three had done little but anger him.
 One zipped by his head as he ran, two others thudding into his chest and arm.
 Blood soaked the inside of his armor, but the wounds were superficial, halted by the magical leather before penetrating deep enough to be a bother.
 “For the head,” the closest elf shouted in his native tongue.
 He managed one last shot before Harruq closed the distance.

 turned back to the elves who had guarded his corridors, and turned then towards our Kale Pacino. They had their eyes on this one, watching him as if they wanted it good. Got it. They would get their Azroni. They deserved it. He bogged down as his shoulder

 Antonil Copernus was quiet as he gazed at the town.
 The wind teased his long blond hair, never letting it rest as he stood.
 The moonlight cast an eerie glow on his gold-tinted armor, which was carefully polished.
 Behind him, the tents of his soldiers, numbering more than six hundred, lay scattered about in loose formation.
 In the silence, an elf walked up beside him, his keen eyes taking in the torches that lit the city.
 “The city is quiet,” the elf said.
 “They await battle.”
 “Let us hope it does not come to that, Dieredon.
 Perhaps they will accept the king’s orders for now.”

She made sure we never felt like we were a burden, but as I look back I know it must have been so difficult for her.
 She never complained and we always felt her love.
 She worked as a carhop at a Bob’s Big Boy hamburger joint and she wore roller skates to serve the drive up customers in their cars.
 My Uncle Dan would take us there at night to visit her and she could sometimes sneak us some food.
 We would watch her roller-skating from car to car and back inside to retrieve her food orders.
 Uncle Dan was a hero to us as he was the only consistent male figure in our life.
 The drive up stations at Bob’s Big Boy were filled with a variety of Hot Rods and they were in all shapes, colors and sizes.
 The engines revved and the tires squealed consistently as the parade of cars cruised through.
 It was an exciting place and a formative moment for both Thomas and me, and helped to cement our lifelong love of muscle cars.
 We were so proud of our mother and we loved to tell our friends where she worked.

The organization of farming utilized the tree to make a plough with which to cultivate repeatedly the same land, giving birth to sedentary societies.
 The organization of crafts, commerce, armies, governments – constructed from a fabric of customs, rules, systems and laws – each made use of the material resources for greater productivity, power and achievement.
 At each stage of this evolution, society discovered the power of knowledge to increase further the productivity of the material, technological and organizational resources at its disposal.
 A knowledge of weather patterns boosted productivity in agriculture.
 A knowledge of astronomy enabled sea-worthy vessels to travel across the oceans to distant lands.
 This led to the invention of systematic education as a method to pass on acquired knowledge and skills to the next generation and thereby continuously increase them.
 The Ultimate Resource
 These rich and varied discoveries came as the result of a careful observation and analysis of the external world around us, an infinite exploration and experimentation with things, an endless trial and error blending of minerals and plants to forge metals and produce medicines.
 As a result, for millennia we have tended to overlook or, at best, grossly underestimate the greatest of all resources and the true source of all the discoveries, inventions, creativity and productive power found in nature – the resource that has made minerals into ships that sail the skies, fashioned grains of sand into tiny electronic brains, released the energy of the sun from the atom, modified the genetic code of plants to increase their vigour and productivity – the ultimate resource, the human being.

He turned to see if Marie was asleep.
 She wasn't there!
 Springing to his feet, he looked around.
 The beach had become crowded while he was asleep, and he didn't see her anywhere.
 "Marie!"
 he called in a moderately loud voice.
 Maybe she'd gone for a swim.
 His heart pounded as he ran toward the waves.
 He hoped she had enough sense not to go out very far.
 Just as he ran into the surf, he heard a familiar laugh.

 Marie liked touching him.
 He was big and muscular, and she'd thought that just looking at him without his shirt was a great pleasure.
 But that was before she'd gotten to run her hands over him.
 After a few minutes she stopped and lay down with a sigh.

“Well,” Rodregas said, “we need to find shelter and if they meant us harm us they would not have shown themselves.
 It’s getting dark.
 Let’s get the horses into the barn.
 If they have been tracking me since I let them out, they don’t seem to want to do any great harm.” With that Rodregas got out of the wagon and started to pull the horses into the barn.
 Their noses were flaring, and he had to pull them almost to the opening.
 As soon as they got close they both went charging in; they sensed the barn was shelter to keep them safe from the Dire Cats.
 Like the farmhouse, the barn was also built of the same impressive large cut stone.
 However, while the stone was in great shape, all other materials seemed to have fallen apart.
 There were several small trees and bushes growing in the barn.
 The floor was also stone, and there was not enough dirt and debris for them to grow very large.

I heaved myself up and made for the door.
 Outside, with the temperature something below zero, I trudged and slid up the sidewalk the few blocks to Tony’s place.
 His mom had given me a key.
 No one was home.
 In my previous life, with a few brief exceptions, I had avoided fistfights by using my size (I grew up fast) and a rather savage look I could muster.
 So I hadn’t known murderous rage.
 It felt righteous, as if revenge weren’t only a need but an act of justice, without which I could no longer live.
 That Polish fellow and I didn’t belong in the same world.
 I went straight for the shotgun then marched back down the icy sidewalk telling myself I would only shoot the Polish guy.

"The jacket is made out of some kind of special material."
 That was the most amazing stunt she saw that day, but there were dozens of special effects and props that filled her with wonder.
 They took a tour of the movie lot, and Marie was excited to see the sets of some of the movies Rick had rented for her.
 The tram they rode crossed a bridge that shook as if it would collapse, and she screamed, clutching Rick's arm.
 A giant shark swam up to the tram as it crossed a river, and as they later emerged from a forest, it began raining, and a flood rushed toward them.
 With so many children on the tram, Marie knew that these "disasters" were just tricks, but she was still glad she could huddle in Rick's arms when the tram seemed to be in danger.

 Rick asked as they stood in line to ride the "E.T."

Everywhere he looked, he saw embers and corpses.
 He spotted the robes of Velixar and ran to them.
 He picked them up and shook them, furious that no body remained.

I opened my eyes to see myself standing in the woods.
 The sky saw clearer and it wasn't raining anymore.
 It was eerie quiet and as I stood there it felt like I had never left the woods.
 I heard a voice whispering one word over and over again.
 “Jazell...” “What?” I called.
 “What do you want?” “Jazell...” the voice whispered again.
 “Jazell.” “What?” I screamed into the trees.
 “What do you want?
 Why do you have to repeat my name over and over again, it's creepy.” “Jazell, beware,” it whispered again.
 “Beware.” I stomped my foot in frustration and yelled, “Beware of what?” “Beware,” it mumbled back.

Eugene – Just like my father.
 My grandmother told me that he was an angry kid.
 Johnny – Yeah, but he managed to get married.
 Eugene – I wish he hadn’t.
 Jim – If he hadn’t then you would have never been born.
 Eugene – I know, it’s a paradox.
 Is it better to live, but to live through years of pain and misery?
 Or is it preferable never to have been born in the first place?
 Jim – That’s a hard one.
 I think I’ll go with having been born though.

As I finally let sleep pull me down into darkness, I almost thought I heard Alec say one last thing.
 The tone was so vulnerable and hesitant he almost sounded like another person.
 "The truth is, I've fallen well and truly in love with you."
 Chapter 23 Someone was calling my name, but I really didn't want to wake up.
 I was still so tired, and I'd had the most wonderful dreams.
 They were a little foggy now, but they seemed to have involved Alec coming to my rescue, and then holding my hand as I went to sleep.
 It wasn't until I finally placed the familiar voice that everything started coming back to me.
 I sat up with an abruptness that nearly knocked Alec off of his perch on the edge of my bed.
 Him still being there, looking at me with a barely restrained amusement glimmering in his eyes, calmed my racing pulse.
 "You're still here."

The establishment of the World Trade Organization paved the way for expanded markets for both developing and developed countries, fuelled a rapid expansion in World Trade, and wove strong bonds of interdependence between erstwhile antagonists across the globe from the Chinese mainland to North America.
 Larger private investment flows invigorated economic growth and made capital more accessible to larger numbers of people than ever before in human history.
 The European Union expanded to embrace newly democratic countries and blazed a path right through the former heartland of nationalism for the integration of the united peoples of Europe.
 Most important of all, the erstwhile very real and imminent threat of global confrontation and nuclear destruction radically diminished, spurred by negotiations between Russia and USA that have led to a 75 per cent reduction in the number of nuclear warheads stockpiled by both sides.
 ICPF’s report projected a vision of Uncommon Opportunities for rapid and radical advances in global peace and development.
 Its central thrust is the inextricable linkage between peace, employment, food security and human development.
 As peace is a sine quo non for development, creation of employment opportunities for all is essential for maintenance of peace and social stability, food security and eradication of all forms of poverty.
 The experience of the past decade strongly supports the view that a more peaceful global environment is more conducive for development.
 Military spending declined by a third in the years immediately following the end of the Cold War, partly due to real cuts in defence spending and partly due to the collapse of the Russian rouble and changes in the value attributed to Soviet arms spending.
 These real gains did not translate into a significant increase in foreign aid, which was what many hoped and expected.

This is especially evident at the international level where the organization of the collective social life of humanity is rudimentary and fragmentary, though far more complete than it was a few decades ago.
 In spite of the phenomenal growth in global communications, transportation, commerce, finance and tourism, it is still more difficult to carry out most activities internationally than it is domestically, because the international activities are not as well organized.
 For instance, transfer of technology still involves a process that is largely trial and error.
 Firms in developing countries seeking to acquire the best available technology for importation or acquisition have to search at considerable expenditure of time and money to discover what is available within their own country as well as overseas.
 The process of identifying and commercially transferring technology can be vastly simplified and accelerated by the establishment of international technology transfer corporations, sponsored by UN agencies such as UNESCO and UNIDO, specializing in all major fields of technology.
 These corporations should be operated on a commercial, for-profit basis, though governments of developing countries could become shareholders in order to promote their formation.
 Each corporation could undertake a detailed study of available technologies in its field and offer to assist corporate customers in developing countries in selecting the most appropriate technology to meet their needs.
 The corporations could also acquire the rights to important technologies with large-scale applications and then market them widely.
 Velocity of social forces
 Speed is a powerful engine for development and an important index of organizational efficiency and effectiveness.

And it isn’t any part of her basic nature, she believes.
 Over some months, through prayer and meditation, she came to believe that evil itself had invaded the world and entered people, and God had allowed this to happen, which led her to a certainty that we are now living in the world’s final days.
 Powered by these revelations, she prayed with intensity and perseverance.
 And God responded by urging her to give herself entirely to him.
 She assured him she was all his.
 For some weeks, he allowed her to rest on that answer, but more and more she became uneasy with it, until she realized she didn’t by any means belong entirely to God.
 Most of her thoughts, concerns and energies went to her family.
 She was the mom of three wonderful kids and the wife of a loving husband.
 In horror, she returned to intense and persistent prayer, telling God he couldn’t possibly mean she should leave her family, could he?

He had thought that he was going to die, an experience that Rodregas of late knew too often.
 He wanted to pull Imeralda down into the bed and celebrate being alive.
 His body was probably too weak to do more than cuddle, but Imeralda seemed to be acting very friendly with the healer.
 Rodregas was not sure if something had changed between them while he was healing.
 The possibility that he had lost what they had just started to explore together made Rodregas’ heart heavy.
 “So, I have been wanting to ask you a question,” said Jordaan.
 “Are the two of you related?
 That is, you and Doi’van?” Rodregas was caught off guard at the ridiculous question.
 “Not to mention the obvious,” Rodregas said, “but Doi’van is an Orqui Hellborn from across the Sea and I am…” Rodregas paused in confusion, what exactly was he now?
 He reached for the closest comparison and said, “I have some Celestial blood, but I am human.” “Oh,” Jordaan said, “well that is strange, you do know that you are also part Hellborn, right?

 God created you, doesn’t that mean that he has the same blood for his ancestors as you? Rodregas seemed surprised. Nobody cared that I was Doi’van.” They wandered the northern, purple desert to find some water, as far as miles and kilometers each day took them

He listened quietly, and hearing nothing, he set the trunk down and quietly walked down the stairs.
 The next floor housed the laboratory.
 The door was locked and he did not want to break it down until he was sure everyone had left.

 He heard nothing but his stomach rumble; he was very hungry and knew that he should eat.
 He was already in the main hall; the room to the right was the kitchen.

 He looked like he had been caught stalking forward on the hunt.
 Rodregas stepped up and just stared at him.
 He was beautiful.

 Rodregas nodded, he knew not to touch, but then realized that his hand was raised and had been reaching out to stroke the lion’s mane.

This sector is as amenable to stimulation by government policies as agriculture or manufacturing, and it also provides impetus for the growth of other sectors.
 Supportive policies have enabled trade, transport and other services to generate more than 50 per cent of all jobs in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.
 Services have produced more than half of all job growth in many other Asian nations, including private day-care centres, nursery schools and computer training institutes, which are multiplying rapidly in many countries, but can be expanded much further.
 India has adopted an innovative, low-cost, self-employment strategy to expand availability of long-distance telecommunications services by setting up small private telephone and fax centres throughout the country.
 Informal private service enterprises in construction, commerce, food catering, repair and transport have vast growth potential.
 Rapid expansion of education, training and public health, especially rural health and education, can also serve as a conscious strategy for employment generation.
 Technology of organization
 Much emphasis is placed on the widening gap in technology between North and South, but the gap in the technology of organization is even greater.

 The Ultimate Resource
 These rich and varied discoveries came as the result of a careful observation and analysis of the external world around us, an infinite exploration and experimentation with things, an endless trial and error blending of minerals and plants to forge metals and produce medicines.
 As a result, for millennia we have tended to overlook or, at best, grossly underestimate the greatest of all resources and the true source of all the discoveries, inventions, creativity and productive power found in nature – the resource that has made minerals into ships that sail the skies, fashioned grains of sand into tiny electronic brains, released the energy of the sun from the atom, modified the genetic code of plants to increase their vigour and productivity – the ultimate resource, the human being.
 World Food Prize recipient and father of India’s milk revolution, Dr V. Kurien, has decried the tendency to credit external factors for the accomplishment of people.
 ‘It is the farmer that has produced this miracle, not the cow.’ And so it can be said of the Industrial Revolution and the Green Revolution.
 Looked at from a different perspective, the entire evolution of civilization is a progressive act of humanity’s self-discovery.
 At each stage of external observation and exploration, people have discovered more of their own inner capacity for resourcefulness.

 She had the same dull blonde hair and muddy-brown eyes as me, though my eyes were specked with green.
 After a long evening ducking her verbal jabs and listening to her theories on the Council’s secret conspiracies, I finally made it to my room.
 A flick of my fingers and light flooded the tiny space.
 I took a quick inventory: the seal on my wardrobe was intact, my drawings were still scattered across the floor, and the stash of cheese remained on the table beside my bed.
 My mother’s pendant hung from a woven leather chain above my pillow, shooting refracted beams across the bed, and I smiled as I sat beneath it.
 Scanning the pages I’d brought home from the library, I tried to find some order.

After Rachel left I spent the next hour trying to get comfortable in Alec's desk chair.
 It was likely the discomfort was more due to the subject matter than the chair, but I just couldn't get comfortable.
 I finally moved my books over to the bed and sprawled out on it.
 Spanish, Math, History, Biology, English.
 The subjects all blurred together as the hours passed by in a blur of academic exhaustion.
 I wanted to go to sleep long before dark, but couldn't justify it, so I just kept grinding along.
 I'd long ago learned that changing subjects and studying something new was almost as good as a break, so I swapped out books on a regular basis, and persevered despite increasingly-frequent head bobs.

In addition, the peace force could be granted the right to recruit personnel directly from member countries Members would also agree to limit their own overall military spending within norms fixed by the organization.
 Members would be banned from possession of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
 Existing weapons would be destroyed or turned over to the peace force.
 As in NATO, members would agree by treaty to consider an attack on one member as an attack on all.
 The peace force would intervene automatically and unconditionally – defensively and, if necessary, offensively – to protect the sovereignty and international borders of any member country, provided that it conformed to the rules under the charter.
 The organization could also assist members in fighting drug trafficking and terrorist activities.
 The benefits of this cooperative peace-keeping mechanism would be manifold:
 Since the charter would bind members and the alliance to eschew the use of force and aggression for any reason, it would represent a stabilizing, non-provocative, non-offensive defence.
 Its charter could also include specific provisions for close association with other international forces.
 Its combined strength and technological capabilities would exceed those of any of its members and constitute a substantial deterrent to aggression against any member country.

 would also include the anomaly that the peace force itself would be the only major international force operating with its respective group members on a full or limited basis. As the commander of the peace force, it would be capable of Regent of Europe peacekeeping and serve as the guardians of the Baltic Sea. It would

 Just remember that Alec's dominant to everyone here, and he'd die for either of us without even a heartbeat's worth of hesitation."
 After Rachel left I spent the next hour trying to get comfortable in Alec's desk chair.
 It was likely the discomfort was more due to the subject matter than the chair, but I just couldn't get comfortable.

“Well, if you would like to, I can find something for you.” I glared at her back and she turned to grab my arm beneath the cloak, yanking me behind her as we left the house through her closet.
 She replaced the cover that hid the entrance and snatched a quiver of arrows from the ground before pulling me forward again.
 “What are those for?” I asked, indicating the arrows, afraid they would somehow be used in my training.
 “They are arrows, Frey.” She was really on a roll today, a delightful mood.
 I shook my head, certain that didn’t bode well for me, and she laughed.
 “We are leaving them for Rhys and Rider to find.” “Are they poisoned?” “Yes.” I considered that.
 “Did they use all the ones you prepared last night?” “You’re silly, Freya.
 It’s fun.” The way she pronounced my name, like it was dear to her, made it harder to be angry with her.
 But I made the effort.
 “It’s not entirely my fault,” I huffed.

My throat was too raw to speak, so Chevelle gave me a canteen.
 I would have taken anything, but I was glad it was water, not hot wine or that foul-tasting elixir.
 “What happened?” I finally choked out, but they were tight-lipped.
 “How do you feel?” Chevelle asked.
 His tone was off, a little shaky.
 I couldn’t tell if he was cross or something else.
 There was something so familiar about him, the way he leaned over me, but my thoughts weren’t working right yet.
 I tried to clear my head before answering.
 “I don’t know.” It was the best I could do.
 “Are you hurt?” “No.” He glanced at my hands, wrapped tightly around the neck of the container, and then back at me.

She'd .

 She frowned for a minute, trying to see all this from his point of view.
 It must be as strange for him as it was for her--a woman from the past had walked into his garden.
 He didn't believe in such things any more than she did, but he'd done his best to help her get back.
 And he'd been so kind and considerate, introducing her to the marvels of his time, seeing to her comfort, holding her when she was frightened .

Thomas would drag out a “rock” of cocaine from the massive pile and crack it open as if he was cutting a diamond.
 The story of its origin and quality were described as if you were listening to a reading from a science fiction novelist.
 To watch these people hang on every word of his bullshit was sickening to me.
 Their wild eyes and grinding jaws were just the physical part of their bizarre behavior.
 People would hover next to windows, peeking out every few seconds, check the locks on the same doors over and over again as their paranoia increased with every line they snorted.
 There was no deterring Thomas from his occupation, as he believed himself invincible—as all drug dealers do.
 I had watched other old friends get hauled off to jail and I didn’t want the same for my brother.
 One afternoon, I called Thomas and a strange voice picked up the phone.
 I asked for Thomas and the person on the phone said, “He is unavailable right now, but tell me what you want and I will get it ready for you to pick up.” It was obviously a cop, and I knew my brother was probably sitting there in handcuffs while they set up every idiot who called for drugs, then collected them like goldfish as they swam into the net.
 I called my mother and told her I thought Thomas had been busted; time would confirm he had.

 Thomas had drunk women in holidays where they danced; Thomas had drunk senior citizens; Thomas had swam at the swimming pool for pajamas—but to expect me to present them in total cocaine laden clothing. Thomas was proficient in doing drugs in Madagascar and he had been parteying them while up

Partly Dylan’s doing, but it was inevitable, it was headed that way, the power of it, the communicative power.
 Man, I sound like Rolling Stone.
 What I mean is that rock wouldn’t have held it’s place if it hadn’t shifted, if the words didn’t start to mean something.
 It was time.
 It was time for music to mean something.
 Dylan, The Beatles, they led the way.
 They said, you know, show us the plan, you don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.
 And the kids sat up and listened.
 It was coming, this revolution of meaning, this concentration on the word.
 And, all along, behind it like a dark river, ran the beat, the melody, a sort of communication device that was both insidious and right out there in the open.

I will pound on them when we are ready to leave.” And with a nervous nod the doors slid closed behind them.
 As the door closed Gorin hastily added, “Remember not to touch anything until the Grand Marshal is present.” Doi’van nodded at the now closed doors and raised his torch.
 The three gazed around the room in wonderment.
 In response to the torch the room seemed to respond with a vague light of its own, which came from all directions.
 The chamber was large with a tall vaulted ceiling like some temple, but no rows of seats or prayer mats did this temple hold.
 Instead it was filled with beasts; lions and wolves and the great mythical animals of the Celestial Realm.
 Most of these he recognized as the great totems of the Celestial Realm, each representing great power.
 The great beasts were full-size and, but for their lack of movement, Rodregas would have thought that they must have traveled to the Celestial Realm itself.

“I would like to see you try with that sword of yours,” Kojas said and smiled wickedly at Seth.
 I knew he was baiting him.
 Seth narrowed his eyes.
 “You can’t trick me into fighting you, Kojas.” “Yeah, we’re not stupid,” I said and stepped next to Seth with my hands on my hips.
 “I mean, if you’re so smart, than why is your name so stupid.” I giggled.
 “Kojas sounds like toe jazz, whatever that is.” I heard Emily laugh and Jason say, “Burn!” Kojas’ eyes flamed but he formed a tight smile.
 “Let me inform you, Jazell, that you are outnumbered five to one?” Man, this guy is good.
 “Um, well we…are cooler than you,” I stumbled.
 “Really Jazell?” Emily hissed from behind me.
 I turned my head to her.

I was rarely injured because I had learned to protect myself from the powerful blows of my stepfather and I knew how to look for an opening and drop my opponent.
 By this time I was close to six feet tall and about 175 pounds.
 I was in great shape and I had endured physical punishment as training.
 Drag racing wasn’t easy on a car, and since we were constantly racing, constantly striving to make the Chevelle faster, inevitably something was always broken.
 Hitchhiking to and from work became a regular event, and I often got rides from the same people every afternoon.
 Frequently I ended up walking home at midnight.
 When I did get home there was usually a gathering of my roommates and their friends.
 Pot smoke always filled the air.
 The family room had an array of donated couches and chairs and beanbags gathered by the roommates and friends.
 A long curled phone cord hung from the center of the ceiling with a roach clip taped to it.

I mean these guys are huge and muscular, at least from a midget’s perspective, and they have those pick-axes they use around the mine.

 Liz – you’re forgetting that the dwarves have just come home after a long day’s work in the mines.
 They’re exhausted, they’re not looking for a fight.
 They don’t have a prayer of taking on all 10 of the midgets.
 The dwarves might be angry about Snow White being kidnapped, but that doesn’t compare to even to the daily life of a midget.
 Midgets have all the pent up rage of being so different from the rest of humanity and condemned to circus life to fuel their fire in the midst of battle.
 The midgets could take the seven dwarves unarmed and surprised.

Britney was talking again, but it was still the kinds of things I could respond to with half my attention.
 I took the opportunity to get a good look at the cafeteria.
 It was incredibly small.
 It was probably on its second generation of students, but looked pretty good still.
 The linoleum floor was faded, but still relatively clean, and the white paint on the walls was conspicuously free of tags and gang signs.
 The students even seemed to be mingling fairly easily with each other.
 I actually kind of missed the feel of armed camps.
 My school hadn't been bad compared to some stories I'd heard from California, but there'd still been some kids beaten pretty severely for crossing the wrong group of wannabe gang members.
 Britney had a piece of pizza, and looked like she was eyeing a piece of cake until she noticed I was trailing along behind her without a tray of my own.
 She actually sighed as she passed the cake.

 "Yes, I understand.
 But--" "No.

As he had stepped closer to punch, the gem at the end had shimmered a soft green.
 “Of all the dumb luck,” he said, a grin spreading across his face.
 “We got some real elves here!”
 They drew their swords.
 Harruq held an arm defensively in front of Qurrah, his eyes darting in all directions.
 Slowly, the leader extended the stick, poking it against Harruq’s chest.
 The soft glow turned into a brilliant flare of emerald.
 “Elves,” the man said.
 “No doubt about it.”
 He laughed to the others and then punched Harruq in the gut.

 Epilogue
 I padded silently through the long, dark halls.
 Emily and Jason walked wordlessly by my side.
 No one spoke because there was nothing to say, and so much to say, at the same time.
 It had been almost a day since Seth disappeared.
 A day since Kojas took him.
 I had told him, when he had first said that Kojas wanted to use him that he didn’t have to worry.
 I should have known that Kojas would do anything to get him, and now Seth was gone.
 After he had been taken and Jason had awakened, the faery jerks had scattered.

“Which way do we go?” Harruq asked.
 “Up,” Qurrah said.
 “And quiet, before you wake him.”
 “Too late,” said a voice from the stairs.
 Both turned to see Ahrqur standing at the top step, his arms crossed.
 He was dressed in a long green robe.
 Silver swirls marked the sleeves and front.
 Brown hair fell far past his shoulders.
 “Pleased to meet you,” Harruq said with a bow.
 “Indeed,” Qurrah said, his hand itching to retrieve his whip curled underneath his raggedy robe.

He finally shrugged and wrote his name on the scroll in front of him.

 “Captain Intreg, do you mind asking a few questions to confirm his status?” The Knight seemed uncomfortable under the hand of the sorcerer but nodded and said to Rodregas, “What is the eighth law of Chivalry?” “Thou shalt never offer combat to someone who is not equal in strength, unless in defense of the honor of the Order, for Justice for the oppressed or in defense of the weak,” he answered.
 Captain Intreg nodded and then asked, “A question of law: two messenger couriers stop at a keep with priority messages and switch out horses.

Developing countries will cut agricultural tariffs by an average of 24 per cent.
 In addition, North American and Western European countries have agreed to cut agricultural subsidies by one-third.
 Together these cuts are expected to result in a 20 per cent rise in exports of agricultural and processed foods by 2005.
 The share of developing countries in this increase has been estimated at $20 billion to $60 billion annually.
 Increased trade can act as a strong stimulus to the growth of agricultural, agro-industrial and rural employment, provided that these countries respond dynamically to the opportunity by raising productivity and strengthening rural infrastructure for storage, processing and distribution.
 However, rising demand within developing countries themselves will limit overall growth of exports, and increasing exports will push up domestic food prices, unless much greater priority is given to matching production with opportunities for home and external trade.
 Increased private investment
 The modernization of the farm sector greatly needs the investment, technology, professional management and marketing expertise which private firms can bring.
 Wherever land reforms have resulted in the division of farms into small parcels, farmers need to be supported by well-organized services, particularly for post-harvest handling, provided either by companies or co-operatives.
 Economic liberalization offers expanded opportunities for private enterprise to work with small producers in a wide range of agro-industries to combine the social benefits of small holdings with the economies and marketing expertise of corporate management.

 governments may be enthusiastic about scaling down the price rises value of farm lands such as manors, the multinationals are often not very happy with the terms with which trade is charged. Initially, developing countries find it difficult to identify the significant agriculture agro-industry trade impacts due to the fact that there

Her mouth was twisted in a smile, loaded with false honey.
 I noticed her eyes then, looking past the heavy paint they wore, to dark green jewels… emeralds.
 They were so like those I had just examined in the mirror that I had to look away.
 “Frey,” I replied softly.
 “Thank you for the room.” She seemed disappointed I had no further comment.
 She flitted her hand in dismissal as she swirled out of the room and back to Chevelle, the metal bracelets around her wrists tinkling like chimes.
 “I’m off to town then.
 You know, a handsome hunk of horsemeat was asking about you this morning.” My ears perked up.
 Someone was asking about Chevelle?

And it was all based on the assumption that something besides light could travel at the speed of light.
 In one small paragraph he found that the entire article was theory upon theory: no one had ever found a black hole or a wormhole or anything that could travel faster than the speed of light.
 "You didn't miss anything," Rick told Marie, setting the article aside.
 "Scientists think that it would be possible to travel through time by going through these wormholes the author mentions, but it's all theory.
 Nobody has ever discovered a wormhole, and none of this stuff has ever been proven."
 Marie sighed.
 "This book isn't hard to follow, but I'm rather skeptical.
 The author says that thought is the way to travel through time.
 He says that if you concentrate hard enough on getting to the time you want to visit, you can do it."

For the first time I realized just how much bigger Brandon was than Alec.
 I'd never seen them so close together.
 They were so careful not to cross paths, it was possible this was a true first, but seeing them now there was no way to get around the fact that Brandon was at least two inches taller, as well as being broader and more muscular.
 I'd seen Alec shirtless, and he had the incredible physique of a swimsuit model, but Brandon's was that of a professional body builder.
 Either of them dwarfed me, but Brandon gave off an air of menace that even Alec's controlled power couldn't offset.
 Brandon's next few words came out in a low growl that I couldn't make out, and then he slowly backed away from Alec before he and the rest of his pack disappeared from sight.
 I finished processing everything about the time Alec turned and walked back.
 I opened my mouth to protest, but he shook his head at me as we all fell into formation around him.
 From what little I knew about Alec's pack, it wasn't uncommon for them to spend time together without the kind of chest-beating byplay that was so much a part of Brandon's group, but our lunch table was even more subdued than I'd expected.
 Faced with an almost complete lack of conversation, I didn't have the courage to ask some of the questions on my mind.

He never failed to disappoint me.
 He saw the child, as he called her, as an opportunity.

 After all, had he not stolen my mother for precisely the same purpose, experimenting with power?
 He did, however, concern himself with where I’d found a human.
 I refused to tell.
 It was the only gift I could give Noble, his safety.
 I laughed as I remembered that was how I’d convinced him to stay, promising him protection.
 A false promise.

By the time his rage calmed, blood was on his hands and the remains of an elf lay in the dirt below the window.
 “Stupid elfie,” he said, gingerly touching the arrow in his neck.
 Not knowing what else to do, he closed his hand about the shaft and pulled.
 A minute later, still lying in agonizing pain, the half-orc managed to pry open one of his healing potions.
 He gulped the swirling blue-silver contents and then tossed the vial.
 Ripping the other arrow out of his side, he felt a warm, soothing sensation fill his body.
 “Are you alright?” he heard a raspy voice ask from atop the stairs.
 “Yeah, I’m fine.
 Just had to take care of something here.”
 He trudged down the stairs to where Qurrah waited.

I didn’t even have time to breath before one of the Thrashers decided that they would like to have a taste of me.
 I decided that I didn’t want to be shredded like some old rug, so I moved out of his path.
 That was the worst mistake I made, without even realizing it.
 At the same time another Thrasher was heading in my direction, and by moving out of the way from the first one, I had placed myself in the path of the second one.
 It slammed into my side at such a great force I tasted blood in my mouth, when I hit the ground.
 Then I felt pain, saw blood, and then nothing at all.

 I heard muffled voices around me as I regained consciousness.
 My head throbbed slightly, and so did my side and my tongue.
 That explained why I had tasted blood; I must have bitten it.

Over thirteen years, K-8, she missed only two days of school, and those were unavoidable.
 Her Christian school was showing an early film version of Tim LeHay’s Left Behind saga, and Pam couldn’t bear the sight of nice enough pastors getting left behind.
 She won an academic scholarship to Pepperdine University and worked her way through two Masters degrees.
 But to teach where she wanted to go, she needed a PhD.
 A baby might stand in the way of her career, she believed, and I couldn’t argue.
 Besides, with a little good fortune and without the cost of another dependent, as soon as Darcy and Cody finished college I could take early retirement from my day job and devote myself to writing, which had been my dream for too many years.
 I longed for the freedom to run off for weeks at a time to some hermitage where I could think better and write with deeper concentration.
 I harbored a suspicion that my writing career has always been stopped at the edge of a breakthrough by distracting worries, usually about family and finances.
 Most of all, I wanted to feel our marriage was, if not secure, then solid.

Felewen wiped the blood from her blade and sheathed it.
 She used the same cloth to clean the blood from her face.
 “Come,” she said.
 “We must go north where we are needed most.”

 The worst seemed to be about the middle of Celed and steadily working its way south.
 They encountered a few soldiers as they hurried there.

And it was all true.
 Suddenly, I couldn’t catch my breath.

The flares were almost dead, but there was just enough light for me to see the smaller figure reel away from the larger as a vicious slash sank home in Alec's chest.
 Time stretched and pulled like taffy, and I had plenty of time to watch Alec fall, to feel splatters of hot liquid even standing so far away.
 A scream ripped itself free from my throat, and it suddenly seemed we really were caught up in a hurricane.
 As the flares finally died, the pulsing pressure, the pins and needles disappeared as well.
 Only that wasn't quite the term for it.
 The power, the energy that'd become more than oppressive, was sucked towards Alec and Brandon, dragging with it my strength, and the unnatural vitality of the rest of the pack.
 I felt a lance of pain sink into my back, mirroring the jolt in my ankle, as all five shape shifters collapsed around me.
 I knew with a certainty I was going to die, that we were all going to die, but that didn't matter.
 It was only right that my existence cease within heartbeats of Alec's.

I had decided he didn’t want to hurt dozens of girls by choosing another over them.
 Too soon, I would learn about other reasons.
 Girls adored him.
 They phoned at all hours, even risking Sylvia’s wrath, and they tailed him through the halls of our school.
 But if he had even kissed one of them, he kept it secret.
 A favorite of his, along with Margaret and Pam, was Carol, who had been his companion at Carmen Ranch club until their mystery afternoon together.
 Whatever happened might've tainted but didn't entirely spoil the pleasure they took in each other’s company.

And, Creole Myers, the interviewer, died just last year of cancer.
 But, if you listen, that is, if you can read between the lines here, you’ll find, not only an extraordinary document, but one that could only come from the personalities involved.
 The voices are theirs.
 The story is theirs, even as it belongs to a generation.
 Let us hearken back, briefly, to those days when music was being made because it was important, because genius finds its own level, because people needed godhead, if that’s not overstating it.
 Before the drugs, the recriminations, the lawsuits, the doubting of the very fiber of what the 60s meant to Memphis, to these sweet souls herein, and to the world at large.
 Let us reimagine it, if we can, in all its efflorescence.
 In all its pied beauty.
 Let’s hear again, “Turntable Poison” as if for the first time and marvel at the voice that said, “We are all naked.”  That said, “Love me for my limo but love me all the way.”  And, that said, presciently, “Death is only a way station, between West Memphis and the coast.” These interviews were done in three sessions in early 1973, in San Francisco, by Creole Myers, at Buddy Gardner’s home.

Rodregas’ next opponent followed in like manner, though he got up and gave Rodregas a second round.
 Rodregas circled around to Doi’van who held his spare shields and the provided lances.
 “This next one is wearing full plate armor, but it is steel.
 If you can take him down you should be in the top ten or fifteen,” Doi’van said.
 Rodregas flexed his shoulders.
 He had the physical power of a Celestial Lion, but blows from mounted lancers had the power to hurt.
 “I think I need to change shields,” he said.
 Doi’van glanced at what remained of Rodregas’ shield and simply nodded and handed him one of their other shields.

 “Well, and then I got lost.

If the worst happens, the rest of the pack may very well have to try and fight their way out of there.

 I ran my finger along his cheek, mirroring the motion he'd done to me so many times.

Alec's smile was gentle.
 It reminded me of how Mom looked when I offered to take care of some especially undesirable duty she'd been procrastinating.
 "No, Mother's still the mistress of this house.
 We've waited too long as it is.
 If we don't take care of it now it may be another week or two before we have a chance, and Donovan will be severely disappointed in both of us."
 They were both smiling now, as if at some shared joke, but that didn't help defuse the sudden feeling of nervousness sweeping through me.
 Rachel followed us down a series of corridors, and then waited as Alec knocked on a plain, oak door.
 A half-second passed, and then responding to something too faint for me to hear, Alec gently opened the door.
 A slightly tilted eyebrow seemed to ask Rachel if she wanted to come inside, but she shook her head, now with the slightest of quivers to her chin.
 Whatever I was expecting from Alec and Rachel's reactions, I didn't get it.

I shouldn't have been surprised when she turned out to be right.
 The new chapter was on probability, which had absolutely nothing to do with the stuff they'd been working on the week before.
 I quickly decided I didn't like the new stuff as much as what I'd been studying on my own, but it was relatively easy, and almost before I knew it class had ended and it was time to go to lunch.
 My doubts about whether or not everyone would be back in school today after three nights of partying were quickly resolved as Britney and I tried to fight through the ridiculous foot traffic on our way to our lockers.
 By the time we made it to the lunch room, I was heartily sick of dodging jocks with shoulders the size of an ox.
 Why on earth did every single one of them think it was necessary to mock fight, throw balls back and forth to each other, or otherwise make a spectacle of themselves?
 My mood was further soured as we arrived to find an unmistakable circle of bystanders signaling an impending fight.
 My first instinct was to go find a teacher before the two idiots hurt each other, but while I was still looking around to see if there was an adult in the room, Britney grabbed my arm and pulled me towards the circle.
 It wasn't until we got closer that I realized there was something wrong with the circle of kids surrounding the combatants.
 Normally everyone pressed in tight for the best possible view.

He didn't need to finish that particular sentence though.
 They'd gone easy because today was Ashure Day, and once the dance finished up, he'd be facing off against Brandon, and it would be stupid to tire himself out when he was going to be fighting for his life.
 It was a thought pretty much guaranteed to stifle a conversation, but I managed a smile.
 "Only you would come back dripping in sweat and say you took it easy."
 Alec's smile was a bit strained at the edges, but the tenderness on his face was genuine.
 "I don't know what I'd have done without you these last few weeks."
 My heart went pitter-patter, but still mindful of the fact that throwing myself at him would just result in him freaking out and keeping me at arm's length, I managed not to go all gooey on the outside too.
 Unfortunately the effort meant I was slow responding.
 He moved on before I got anything out.

The cold, wet ground seeped through the material covering my legs, and I shifted, fidgeting as I looked up at him.
 “I mean I can’t do magic, just useless stuff… lighting candles…” “Then we start with fire,” he said.
 Chevelle lowered his hand to mine and stood, pulling me up and toward the center of the clearing.
 When we’d distanced ourselves from the tree line, he stopped and turned back to me, still holding my right hand.
 My eyes followed his as he looked down at our clasped hands and a cool blue flame lit on my right sleeve.
 Immediately, my free hand jerked up to extinguish it.
 Chevelle took it to keep me from smacking at the flame, which had already disappeared.
 “No,” he said, “use the magic.
 Feel it.” I nodded and he returned his gaze to our hands, now both connected.
 He couldn’t have been much older than I, but his hands dwarfed mine and it made me feel suddenly, fleetingly, like a child again.

 He looked confused.

 “But not to worry, I keep it contained to elements and minerals, no breeding.
 I leave that to Steed.” She laughed at her own words as she passed us on the way to her room.
 I found myself reevaluating her now that I knew she was Steed’s sister.
 Chevelle noticed me watching her.

Monetary variables are indicators of the functioning of an economy, but the essential factors which determine the strength and health of an economy are the productivity of its enterprises and its workforce and the material resources of the country.
 Tight monetary policy can generate intense short-term pressure for change in behaviour, but this pressure is applied indiscriminately and often with unexpected and unanticipated results.
 The primary result of premature liberalization of prices was to encourage trade and speculation while discouraging production and investment.
 It distracted attention from fundamental changes in institutions and social attitudes needed for the transition to be successful.
 Macro-level policy measures have to be complemented and supported by parallel micro-level efforts to educate the population about the new economic system, to generate a free flow of information – not just freedom, but the actual exchange of information, which is still severely limited in these countries – to develop new distribution systems, to impart appropriate business and managerial skills, to provide access to credit, to build up new social institutions and to en courage and promote new enterprises.
 In most cities of the former Soviet Union, for instance, there is not a single whole sale market for food.
 There are no systems for consumer credit, no agencies in charge of promoting small business development.
 In the absence of these and other essential micro-level conditions, even the right macro-level strategy will not evoke the anticipated response.
 6.Government regulation is essential for a free market: A free market does not mean an unregulated one.
 Quite understandably, decades of totalitarian government had generated such powerful resentment against strong government that by way of re action the society sought for solutions which did not require government to take a highly visible, leading role.

 said during the 1930s, over more than 60% of the period of the Revolution, the exchange of bread and orange with those common for water and medicine, had not had a particularly positive effect on the social in general, because the increase in prices for metal/ stock which did not obviously rise in per

Emily raised her arms and the ground shook under a faery.
 Roots twisted upward and wrapped around one of the five faery men that were left.
 The other four fell dead from my arrows and Jason's knives.
 I ran out from behind the tree and stormed over to the squirming faery man.
 Or I should to call them faery jerks now.
 I grabbed his coat and forced him to look at me.
 He smirked and I couldn't hold back the urge to slap him.
 I slapped my hand across his face so hard it left a mark on his cheek.
 “Start talking,” I snarled.
 “Who are you guys and what are you doing?” The faery jerk smirked again.

That’s basically it.” “We don’t know what the light was.” Emily added.
 “But whatever it was, it saved your life.” “Uh I have a feeling I should thank it, but I don’t know how you thank light.” I muttered.
 “You thank it like you would thank anyone else,” A voice said.
 I almost jumped to the moon in surprise.
 Out of nowhere someone, or something, appeared beside Jason.
 I think Jason was more scared because he actually jumped into the air.
 As it came into view, it became obvious that it was a girl.
 She in a yellow cloak and had dazzling red hair.
 She smiled warmly at us with her chocolate brown eyes and I realized she had pointed ears.
 So I basically made the conclusion that she wasn’t human.

Another man they called “The Banker,” and he really was a banker but he was crooked as a stick.
 They had something on him because he would do whatever my stepfather told him to do.
 I remember going to the bank and walking in or out with bags of cash.
 The “Judge” was actually a Judge and he lived next door.
 He was a nice man.
 I babysat his kids and watched his house while he vacationed, and did some odd jobs for him.
 My stepfather and his associates spoke openly about their various girlfriends and the dual lives they led.
 Dino also had a girlfriend and a separate apartment in which he put her up.
 My brother and I were young and we were afraid of this man so we didn’t disclose what we knew to anyone.
 When I was about fourteen years old, I missed curfew, which I knew was a big mistake.

It worked!
 Clearly his opponent, though set for a heavy blow, was not expecting the strength of Rodregas’ bash.
 Still his opponent was too good to fall, even when surprised.
 And even as he half fell backwards he used the momentum to slide down and try to land a blow low under the shield.
 Rodregas had both quickness and strength on his side.
 He blocked the blow with his sword and then bashed down quick and hard multiple times with his shield.
 He thought he heard a bone break.
 Rodregas paused and the knight signaled him as victor with a finger to the Heavens.
 Rodregas followed this pattern throughout the day.
 He kept using his sword more to block than to attack and kept using his shield offensively.

Some blood and dirt, maybe, but no filth.”
 Harruq closed his eyes and listened as he tried to slow his pulse.
 He had no clue who this Aurelia was, but if she wanted to intervene he was glad to let her.
 “This does not concern you, elf,” said one of the guards.
 Harruq coughed at this.
 The woman saving him was an elf?
 Had the world turned upside down?
 “Oh really?” Aurelia said.
 “How sad.”
 “We said go, now, or else.”

That proved that Igneeria had worse things to hide than what we thought was bad.
 The thing walked forward and the crowd parted to make it a path, falling silent.
 I find myself creeping back until I could barely see the scene below.
 I was afraid that it would see me.
 Then I got a glimpse of what it had killed and I had to hold back my tears.
 The poor body of the dwarf who had brought us here was lying in a contorted heap, limbs twisted in all directions.
 The scene was awful and I had to prevent myself from throwing up.
 Then I knew why they beat and killed him.
 All the other dwarves were on Kojas.
 This dwarf must have betrayed Kojas to bring information to whoever “her majesty” was and to help us into Igneeria.

Cleo – I doubt that this is the ideal location for a proper mother to daughter talk, but we aren’t exactly the ideal mother and daughter.
 I should have done this a long time ago, but I was busy with other things then… Where to begin.
 With the basics I suppose, you already know about the mechanics of sex, but it’s up to me to fill you in on men themselves.
 Men are stupid.
 I mean it in the most loving way possible.
 But, men are stupid.
 They’re blind, they don’t see or understand what is standing right in front of them, what is absolutely plain to you and I.
 Take you’re friend Jim for example, I doubt its even crossed his mind that you have any romantic interest in him what-so-ever.

After I grew to manhood, I decided my true place was among one of the other clans, one that follows the lordship of the Hellborn.” He spoke this very slowly each deep rumble of his tone dragged out.
 “I was wrong though, and quickly realized that those who follow the Lords of the Infernal Realms were even a worse fit for me than at home, though they did see me as royal blood and not tainted.” Doi’van added, “I eventually decided to start somewhere new and took a ship across the inland sea.” Doi’van paused at this and shook his head, his hair flying wild, as he seemed to want to shake out a memory from his massive head before he continued.
 “I am afraid I did not ask enough questions.
 I just wanted to get a fresh start.
 I was in Guild Dealer Taigas’ Menagerie to be sold within a week of my arrival.” He finished, his smile fading at the memory.
 “When was that?” Rodregas asked.
 Doi’van looked at him for a second and said, “Two years ago.” “But that makes no sense,” Rodregas said, his voice angry though he did not know why.
 “The Guild is supposed to be trying to make their Immortalists members Celestial.
 Why would they hold you for two years?” Doi’van nodded but then shook his head.
 “Trust me, I would like to know that answer more then you.” Doi’van’s smile was now long gone and with a shrug of his huge misshaped shoulders, he changed the subject.

 ’’van answered this, bringing his now bloody mouth toward his palm and bumped the palm on the handlebar itself. Everyone’s strange regret was in the ribs, causing one to slip who wanted to take control of him and the cavalier being hit repeatedly.<eop> Rodregas turned to

The drab colors were gone, leaving scenes made up of multi-hued strands of light.
 It was like waking up and having someone tell you they'd been reading your mind.
 The pieces weren't of specific places or events from my dreams, but they were an exact match for how they'd looked and felt.
 I felt my hands start to shake.
 It was like I'd had too much forced on me too quickly.
 I wanted to just collapse and let unconsciousness overcome me, but something pulled me onward towards the next series of pictures, and then the next after that.
 I wanted to stop.
 Each piece opened up another fragment of my soul, revealing a new pain that I'd kept hidden for the last few months.
 The last picture was next to a door, which I opened almost without realizing I was doing so.
 The organized confusion of a true artist met my gaze.

Lack of access to information about job or training opportunities retards re-employment.
 Sweden operates one of the most extensive and efficient employment services, in close cooperation with business, that is responsible for filling 60 per cent of total job vacancies.
 Improve labour market information systems within and between countries by increasing the accuracy and comparability of data, requiring mandatory reporting by businesses of all sizes, and freely exchanging information between cities, states and countries on successful employment-generating strategies.
 8.Raise minimum standards for education: Higher education increases productivity, raises personal expectations and consumption, and generates additional jobs in education and elsewhere.
 Lack of qualifications, inadequate and out-dated skills commonly characterize the long-term unemployed.
 There is a strong positive correlation between higher education and higher incomes.
 The employment rate for college graduates in the United States is 75 per cent versus 48 per cent for high school drop- outs; at the height of the recent recession, 3.2 per cent of college graduates were unemployed compared with 11.4 per cent of high school drop-outs.
 Only 57 per cent of 18-year-olds in the OECD countries are pursuing formal education.
 The Japanese built their highly competitive workforce by raising the educational attainments of the bottom half of their primary and secondary school population.
 Raising the minimum compulsory level of education, as Belgium did in the mid-1980s from 16 years to 18, slows the entrance of young people into the labour market, better equips them for employment and in creases the demand for teachers.

 The only kind of magic that matters.
 So, why would Buddy turn his back on the band after that triumph?
 There are as many theories as theorists.
 Buddy wanted success, bigger success.
 He tasted perfection with Turntable Poison but it was local perfection.
 The album, though notorious today, an insider’s treasure trove, a collector’s grail, did not sell outside of Memphis.
 No major label bought the rights to it.
 Still, even this late, one wishes, with the advent of the compact disc revolution, that it would be reissued.

The best fighters are the best thinkers.” “Fighters?” I asked, confused.
 He shook his head again, as if clearing it.
 There was a long pause as I waited for his answer.
 “I’d like you to practice just for protection.” “I have fire.” He picked up a fallen branch, long and jagged, and snapped the smaller twigs from its side.
 “Yes, but you should learn to think more openly.
 It is an important resource and should be familiar to you.
 You should have years of experience by now.” “Why don’t I?” He stopped.

And he lived to be, oh I don’t know, 117 or something ridiculous.
 Never made it, you know, never cut a record for Chess or whoever.

He opened his shirt and, as he suspected, another purse hung from his neck.
 It was of flat leather and inside it were twelve pieces of silver and a small book.
 Rodregas tentatively touched the book and it buzzed slightly of magic.
 It held no foulness so he tossed it into the trunk.
 He added the coin purses to the robe he was wearing.
 He still needed more hard money and some decent clothes.
 Rodregas looked out the window to see a few people leaving the keep grounds, and a few still hanging around the yard.
 He knew he could not leave without everyone seeing him.

I clutched my midsection to find it was covered in bandages.
 “What exactly happened?” I questioned.
 Seth glanced at Emily and back at me, “I don’t really know.
 We turned around to see you being mauled by a Thrasher.
 Before either of us could do anything, some light appeared out of nowhere.
 When it died down, we found you lying on the ground unconscious.
 That’s basically it.” “We don’t know what the light was.” Emily added.
 “But whatever it was, it saved your life.” “Uh I have a feeling I should thank it, but I don’t know how you thank light.” I muttered.
 “You thank it like you would thank anyone else,” A voice said.
 I almost jumped to the moon in surprise.

 The piercing green eyes bore into mine and I was more scared than I had ever been in all 15 years of my life.

 We all tensed, prepared for a fight.
 All of a sudden, Emily walked towards the dragon.
 Seth yelled at her to get back but she ignored him.
 She stood right in front of its head and opened her mouth, bizarre sounds started coming out.
 We all stood there mesmerized as she grunted, growled, snorted and hissed at the dragon.
 I expected it to just take a huge bite out of her, but it seemed as surprised as we were.

They seemed to be close, but muffled—maybe in the next room or down a corridor—as they echoed off the stones.
 I thought I’d picked out Anvil’s deep voice.
 “Trapped here like rats… cowards…” He was outraged.
 Someone else, Grey maybe, worry coloring his tone.
 “We can’t just leave them out there.” I knew Chevelle’s voice, interlaced between the other comments.
 “She’s not ready… we can’t… too soon.” And a voice I couldn’t place.

"How's your homework coming?"
 Now I did frown at him.
 "I think my mind's going to explode if I look at my Biology book even just one more time this weekend.
 Other than that things are great."
 Alec's chuckle seemed to reach out and caress me.
 "I take it you'd be up for a brief field trip then?"
 My ears must have perked up.
 For all that we'd spent an incredible amount of time together over the last little bit, he hadn't taken me anywhere.
 "A field trip sounds great.
 Except I have to be back at least three hours before the dance, or Rachel and Jasmin will eat me.

 " In the same vein. "Turns out, would You want to go?" Alec disappeared hanged himself.<eop> Erin's face flew up against mine, all of us were staring, my heart was at it for a solid beat and a tear welled over her amazing beautiful face.

The chuckle was a little more resigned, but he didn't argue, so I launched into my first question before I'd really thought it through.
 "What...I mean, you're all so different..." I trailed off into silence worried he was going to be mad.
 "I think you meant to ask what I am."
 Alec sighed, but it wasn't an angry sigh, so I nodded, forgetting for a moment that he couldn't see me in the darkness.
 "We share a little in common with a bunch of different legends, but none get it quite right.
 In short, we're shape shifters, people who can take the form of animals."
 I'd already seen that for myself, but it was strangely exhilarating to hear him admit it.
 "You mean like werewolves?"
 There was a hiss of sound, as if I'd just hit him.
 For a second I worried I'd made him angry.

 question was asked straight ahead, a question with whooshed bass lines. There was no way he could answer it at the moment, without facing me back, even for a split second... There was something about Alec that I normally didn't notice, that just hadn't bothered me

How is that possible?"
 Rachel's expression as she tried to understand my question was so surprised it actually managed to lighten the mood.
 "Oh, I forget sometimes how much you don't know.
 I'm normal, and Mom's normal, but everyone else is a shape shifter.
 Human-shape shifter marriages almost never happen, but when they do the kids can go either way.
 Alec became a shape shifter, and I'm just a run-of-the-mill girl without even a single superpower."
 We sat in silence for several seconds as I tried to process how that new piece of information fit in with everything else I already knew.
 The obvious, if somewhat selfish, implication was that maybe it really was possible for someone like Alec to want to be with someone like me.
 There were plenty of other things to think about though.
 "Wow, is that hard?

He looked like total shit, and when we confronted him about it he was feeling bad enough that he confessed: He was addicted to the pain pill known as Oxy.
 He told us that he needed our help to get off of it.
 We never thought to find the reasoning behind the drug abuse, we just thought he had tried it and grew to feel dependent on it.
 He was always a tough kid to raise and he was often a handful and we felt this problem could be handled like any other.
 But we were novices when it came to helping someone kick drug addiction.
 We did our best to assist him and we attempted to detox him at home.
 We called Brandon’s real doctor (not the ones who prescribe marijuana) and asked for guidance.
 We tried to keep him away from everyone we knew until we could get the drugs out of his system.
 We told no one.
 It needed to be our immediate family’s dirty little secret.

 That’s what you really have to talk about, the lyrics.
 I don’t think anyone would claim any rock song is today’s “The Second Coming,” –except, maybe some critics who want to call Dylan our Dante.
 But, the words are what’s become important.

Eric’s high school senior-class picture, blown up to poster size and framed, hung facing the entry door.
 As I entered, Sylvia's fierce green eyes taunted me.
 She demanded, “What’s the purpose of life?” “Give me a minute,” I said.
 “To know love and serve God,” she declared, with a hiss on "serve."
 Later she would tell me she got that answer from a priest in an orphanage where, as a teenager terrified of her own sister, she had gone to seek refuge.
 Sylvia’s challenge sent me to 1 John 4:8.

"Yes."
 She'd become so accustomed to being honest with him that she didn't even think about dissimulating.
 "Why?"
 When she merely glanced up at him and quickened her pace, he caught her arm.
 "I'm sorry--don't be mad.
 I'll buy you some frozen yogurt.
 That'll make you feel better."
 She gave him a small smile, but when they reached the yogurt stand, she said that she didn't want any.
 She was quiet during the ride home, and after a few attempts to draw her into conversation, he left her alone, unable to figure out what was bothering her.
 "Do you want to watch TV?"

 "Since the morning--I don't think if it's anything like I want to do" yet. "That or something that's just over?"<eop> He sat back and went back to tend dog Wingard, where the puppy was being tended by po Gropper.

We all tensed, prepared for a fight.
 All of a sudden, Emily walked towards the dragon.
 Seth yelled at her to get back but she ignored him.
 She stood right in front of its head and opened her mouth, bizarre sounds started coming out.
 We all stood there mesmerized as she grunted, growled, snorted and hissed at the dragon.
 I expected it to just take a huge bite out of her, but it seemed as surprised as we were.
 “Emily, what's going on?” I shouted to her and started to walk over.
 Seth reached out and grabbed my arm.
 I spun around, suddenly annoyed.
 He shook his head and nodded over to the dragon.

Thomas had also conned or borrowed thousands of dollars from mutual friends and associates, and it was not uncommon for my wife and me to be confronted by angry people in restaurants or public places because my brother owed them money.
 The last straw with Thomas was over Christmas many years back when he became so violent and threatening that Lisa and I decided to not see him or his family again.
 We even told our children that if Uncle Thomas came to our house or ever tried to get them in a car that they were to run to any other adult.
 We did not know what drug he was on or how far he would go.
 When he moved to southern California, we were not faced with Thomas’s problems anymore.
 I crossed him off of my list—the brother who had stood shoulder to shoulder with me through all the moves, the abuse, and so much else.
 The brother who for a while was all I had was completely estranged from me.
 I had put Thomas in a similar category as my biological Father, Richard.
 I considered that in both of their cases, nothing good seemed to happen when I associated with them so I just kept them out of my life and my family’s as well.
 The latest stories I had heard about Thomas were that while at one point he had escalated his abuse to injecting heroin, he then attended a drug rehab center called Narconon, which had apparently enabled him to be clean for the last couple of years.

 long heard now was that he was suffering from depression and fatigue. When it became obvious that he had lost lots of sleep and had enduring such power and abuse for so many years, what remained in him evaporated most slowly. He only begged me and would plead for me to see him again.<eop>

She turned, facing the direction Chevelle had gone, and left me to my discoveries.
 I expected fury from my father.
 He never failed to disappoint me.
 He saw the child, as he called her, as an opportunity.
 I shouldn’t have been surprised.
 After all, had he not stolen my mother for precisely the same purpose, experimenting with power?
 He did, however, concern himself with where I’d found a human.
 I refused to tell.
 It was the only gift I could give Noble, his safety.
 I laughed as I remembered that was how I’d convinced him to stay, promising him protection.

I had been dressed in a vest of dark leather and slim pants, carved medallions adorning my chest, but my feet were bare as they crossed the polished stone floor of the bedroom, at ease in a place they seemed to know.
 I stepped out into the sun, and I had to steady myself on the stone ledge.
 Not because of the lightheadedness, though I was feeling faint, but because below me, before the steps to what I now realized was a castle, a thousand elves watched me.
 I sucked in a harsh breath, unable to get my mind to accept what I knew was happening.
 I had been so oblivious.
 Reading the diary, learning of my mother and her ties to the throne.
 It had told of my own life, of what I was to become, a reality that would not be put to rights in my broken mind.
 But as I stared down, the assembled pieces of my shattered self held together by no more than tattered bits of string, I understood.
 This was my place.
 I heard Ruby behind me now.

“Seth, oh when will you learn?” Seth groaned and grabbed at his sword, but Kojas kicked it away.
 Then he slashed his sword across Seth’s face.
 I saw the thin blue line well up on his cheek.
 Kojas laughed.
 “You can’t beat me; you can never be safe.” Seth pushed himself up and dove for his sword, which was off to the side.
 Kojas flicked his sword down and I saw Seth flinch.
 He looked at his arm in amazement where a deep cut had sliced through his clothes.
 He pressed his fingers on his arm to stop the blood and continued to scoot towards the sword.
 Kojas stepped to the side and blocked his path.
 Seth gazed up at him and I saw his eyes blaze in hate.

 Then, after Turntable Poison, we were headliners.
 It was great, a heady period, sure, especially for Skippy and Crafty, Castor and Pollux as I called them.
 They thought they’d landed in pigshit heaven, man.
 And we had all these other bands opening for us—man.
 And looking up to us.
 We were teenagers and we had these other guys, girls, coming up to us, asking about Dickinson and what I meant by “hoodoo on the bloody muddy” or some shit, something they heard on the album.
 It was weird.
 But, you know, I was kind of lost at that time—this was right before Lor came into my life—and I had all these groupies, all these chicks, and I’d ball them, right?, but really I’d be thinking about the music, about what’s next, musically, about soloing, about getting my axe to sound like a sax.
 I was way gone on the music, man, and it just shoved everything out of me, everything else.

We’d be traveling to the peak, they’d said.
 I couldn’t guess what waited there, but that didn’t stop the hope that it was something of my mother, my family.
 But even if it wasn’t, I’d be that much farther away from the village and council.
 The second bit of Ruby’s parting comment registered, so I excused myself to her room with a yawn and a short good night.
 I closed the door behind me, and though tired, knew I wouldn’t sleep with him in the next room.
 I walked to the back window and stared out into the night.
 Moonlight glinted off Ruby’s figure in the distance, heading away from the village.
 I didn’t think.
 I just pulled a cloak from the pile on her bed and was out the hidden door behind the wardrobe.
 I ran in a crouch, praying no one spotted me as I gained on her.

“Don’t worry about it, Frey.” I wondered if I’d looked frightened.

 I meant to smile at him, but only succeeded in pressing my lips into a flat line.
 “Rest now.

 But he did not.
 He simply stood and walked from the room.
 Ruby saw me watching.

“Aurelia?” the elf asked.
 “Why in all of Dezrel would you be looking for her?”
 “She, um, I kind of…” The half-orc faltered.
 “I owe her a favor.”
 The elf smiled as if trying to appear amused, but it faltered miserably.
 “You are looking in the wrong place,” he said.
 “Search the woods just outside town.
 Call her name a couple times.
 She’ll hear you.”
 “Thank you,” Harruq said, grateful even though his insides churned.

Teachers were a little harder, but if you didn't have the help of your 'friends', then they became an insurmountable obstacle.
 The gears finally ground to a stop and Britney sighed as she put her head down on the table.
 I tried to stop from smiling at her theatrics, but happened to look over at Rachel just in time to see a matching smile on the younger girl's face.
 Before I could look away, Rachel held up the red side of her card.
 "Do you have a minute?"
 Happy to be able to do something, I hurried over and took a look at her open book.
 "Fractions, huh?"
 "Yeah, I'm supposed to reduce them after I finish adding, but I can't seem to get to the same answer as the book on this one."
 She'd transposed a couple of the numbers when working on one of the intermediate steps.
 "Here it is, you've changed the numbers here, it should be fourteen sixty-fifths, not fourteen fifty-sixths."

Then we’ll go back to soaking each other randomly.” “Yes, I’m happy.” I didn’t call a truce for the warnings.
 I did it because that’s when I’d talk to Seth and get his secret out of him.
 Then maybe I could help him and stop having to watch his miserable face.
 Emily made a face and left the room to dial Jason’s number and tell him about the meeting.
 I waited patiently for her to come back in my room.
 I can’t wait long because I have a tendency to go crazy, so I walked up to my window sill and looked at the sky.
 I stared it and turned around to see Emily come back in.
 But not before my eyes caught a flash of blue.
 Emily and I parked our bikes and headed into the woods and towards the clearing.
 We stepped into it, and I took in the familiar feeling.

The feeling lasted exactly as long as it took me to sit down, listen to Mrs. Sorenson tell us all that she'd finished grading our tests, and then see the big, self-satisfied 'D' sitting at the top of my paper.
 For a second it felt as though my heart had stopped beating.
 I'd never done worse than a 'B' on any assignment or test since I'd finished up Kindergarten.
 I couldn't take this home and show my mom.
 Head in the clouds half of the time or not, she'd still freak out.
 Heck, I was already freaking out enough for the both of us.
 This was going on my high school transcript.

You know Memphis.
 I really felt like here was a woman made of soul and blood and electricity and philharmonic, eldritch diablerie, you know?
 I thought she was fucking Terpsichore, man.
 And she was so beautiful—she IS so beautiful—that I was stopped like a clock.
 I was a man hit in the heart with a sledgehammer.
 She just reached out and took my hand.
 It was that simple, that profound.
 She was looking right into me, like I was a sideshow mirror, and maybe I was, man.
 Distorting images, throwing off suncats.
 She saw it all, clear as crystal.

 at the same time, it was all half the same, only half the same. So it was so... so simple to realize that, to realize that this is not... but that this is this world. So she said, go on. And that is what happened.

Why, did you get another vision?” “Yes,” I said.
 “It was with the same voice that was in my last dream.
 Only this time, I talked to the ghost girl.” “You did?
 What did she say?” “She hinted that she knew who made us this way and who attacked us that day,” I said.
 “She also said that Kojas would use our emotions against us and try to get us to come to him.” Something dark crossed Seth's face.
 “She also said that we were chosen because of our strong bond, but she said, not to test it,” I continued.
 “She also told me not to go into the shadows.” Seth stretched.
 “So the usual confusion?” “I got more this time, Seth.
 Anyway, do you have any information to offer here?” I asked with an edge to my voice.
 Seth put his arms in surrender.

The rest of the night passed quickly as Rodregas did his best to bandage his stomach wound.
 He did not think the knife had cut into anything too important; at least it was not bleeding too badly.
 He was surprised that he was not more tired; maybe his new body handled such things better and could make do with less sleep.
 He was usually a light sleeper and was very surprised that they had been able to get the drop on him.
 His guess was that the AElf maiden had cast some sort of spell on him to mask their approach, and he kept a close eye on her to make sure she did not repeat the effort.
 Of course she was also very nice to look at, so he did not need much of an excuse to enjoy the view.
 In the morning, he slowly pulled out some of the supplies and bundled them.
 He tried not to show how much he hurt.
 The wound might not kill him, but every movement hurt.
 He also handed Audrian a few of his coins.

 "Sharon insisted.
 She said set-ups are awkward enough without all the formality."

 "Not here yet."

"Your wolves were lawbreakers who were executed before they could break further laws.
 The protection of the people, of the secrets that guard our nature from the dayborn, represents a law that supersedes any question of territory or dominance."
 The energy suddenly rolling off of the gathered shape shifters nearly drove me to my knees as Alec continued.
 "By their actions Adriana Paige learned of our nature, and it was only by the grace of the Maker that I was able to stop them from killing her.
 Their deaths were an unavoidable price to save an innocent."
 Some of the faces across the circle from me flinched a little, and I had a moment to wonder if Brandon hadn't told them the truth about what'd happened.
 "Her life belonged to me, it was mine to dispose of as I saw fit."
 I opened my mouth to protest, but closed it at a sharp jab in the ribs from Rachel.
 "The ancient laws don't support her life being a disposable commodity, extinguished at your whim.
 Not even the bond of Ja'tell provides you with that right."

 Yes, that's true." Brandon rigidly tapped the shape stun grid against the side of the templars, and drew his own illumination sword as volleys of fire followed that expression. "You linger in the moonlight?! What are you doing?"<eop> I

Her father had amazed her by showing her his love in a variety of ways.
 He and her brother had reconciled.
 She'd had several of the heart-to-heart talks with her mother that she'd longed for.
 She should be happier than she had ever been in her life.
 But she wasn't.
 She was more miserable than she had ever been in her life.
 All she could think about was Rick.
 As hard as it was to admit, she missed him more than she'd missed her family.
 When she'd walked into 2011, she'd been frightened out of her mind.
 It had been so fantastic, so strange and sudden.

"You're welcome.
 Does that mean we can go to Vegas?"
 It seemed like a crime to deny her, but I knew Mom didn't have the spare money to send me on a two-hour trip to an opera.
 I was working now, but by the time I could save up enough to pay for gas, food, and a ticket, the production would've moved on.
 "I'm sorry, I'd like to go, but I just don't think I can.
 If it was running for an extra month or two I could probably save up enough money from tutoring, but it isn't, so it just isn't going to happen."
 Rachel nodded, and for a second it was easy to forget that she probably got more spending money each month than I'd see all year.
 "That's okay.
 Things like that are always coming through Vegas.
 We can just go the next time they come to town."

Which, for reasons I’ll soon learn, turns me once again to thoughts of Eric.
 After a mile or so I’m questioning whether, on that Sunday as he walked over the hill between Sylvia's house and Kenny Niedermeyer's, Eric got handed the choice to save me and/or Billy, or to save himself.
 The only answer I receive is a maybe.
 But all I need is to recognize the long shot possibility that the dearest person I have known gave his life for me and, despite the sorrow, my heart leaps with adoration.
 For a moment on Highway 101 in Pismo Beach, I feel sure that Eric was Jesus.
 Not in full, as in a Second Coming.
 But in a way so that Jesus entered him and took possession.
 While this thought grips me, both Eric and Jesus become so precious the word adore feels timid and weak.

As government and political leaders know only too well, an organization with responsibility but without authority is doomed to failure.
 Unless UN member states invest international institutions with the necessary authority and meet their financial commitments to support them, the world will continue to drift and flounder, powerless to oppose petty dictators and ruthless aggression.
 Unless a cooperative world military force comes into existence, every country will continue to be burdened with the enormous expense and insecurity characteristic of the old system.
 Perhaps more than any other institution, the military has under stood and demonstrated the enormous power of organization to accomplish a goal.
 The Gulf War was a dramatic illustration of the importance of reliable information, perfect planning, logistical support systems, effective chains of command and swift responsiveness to changing situations.
 If humankind could mobilize and apply the same efficiency to the war on poverty and unemployment that it has exhibited in preparing for and waging military wars against each other, very soon there would be no more poverty or unemployment to fight.
 During the Second World War Ford Motors converted from manufacture of cars for the masses to making trucks and airplanes for the military, producing B-24 bombers at the rate of one per hour from a single production plant.
 If conversion from civilian to military production could be carried out by so many countries within one or two years, it must be possible to convert the military from war-based to peace-based applications, and defence industries from military to civilian production, within half a decade.
 That requires human resourcefulness in organizational innovation.
 Organization is the means by which people work together cooperatively to achieve common goals and, in the process, to serve society in a wide range of functions.

“So I understand that you are to journey to the Cathedral of the Heavens for this year’s open tourney?” Taiga asked his voice as melodic as one would expect from an elf, but just a tad deeper than one would think.
 “Yes, my lord, I leave in the morning,” Van’dret replied.
 “Excellent, you will have to keep your eyes open for potential talent worthy of the Immortal Guard,” Taiga stated.
 Van’dret nodded, that was one of his main responsibilities, but it could not be why he had been invited up to Taiga’s solar.
 “I would encourage you to be careful on your trip over.
 You did hear about what happened to Ravenhurr?” asked Taiga.
 Van’dret almost felt his eye brows rise, “of course, but what should I watch out for?

"This isn't the time; we need to get you back home to your mom.

 My mind was still a little fuzzy, but it was working well enough for me to know he was wrong.
 "No.
 She's not going to be home until Sunday.
 There isn't any reason to go back there yet."
 I looked around for Rachel, but she'd disappeared sometime between when I'd started falling, and when I'd thought to thank her.
 "You mean she wasn't planning on coming back until Sunday.

 "Right then, I believe there is a vacancy next to Ms. Samuels in the back."
 People were still trickling into the room, so at least I was spared the full gantlet, but the few gazes I met were still unfriendly until I reached the last table.
 The skinny-ish blond girl already at the table smiled at me as I sat down.

 As soon as I had my jacket wrapped around it around me, my head went to the side. "What is this important?" Anyone could hear this information. Nothing to benefit from hearing the talks for. "No. But I will wait for it until afternoon after enrolling."

After buying Rick a baja, they bought a multi-colored blanket and a leather purse.
 Marie loved bargaining, but the only other thing she saw that she wanted was a little glass carousel that she managed to get from ten dollars down to five.
 "Can't we eat here somewhere, Rick?
 I'd like to try the food."
 "No, you wouldn't," he said as they approached customs.
 "The water down here is contaminated.

It took a while to get this angel out of my blood—it was like going for detox, you know?
 Shit.
 (laughs) What were we talking about?
 Oh—the song, yeah, anyway, that’s what the song is about, that lost time, that time I went away and came back.
 I still like the lyrics: I still imagine a face white like faith’s hue and a dimple carved there and a disdain for any attention.
 How attractive these qualities are.
 How they still reverberate across the gulf of time.
 It really is a gulf, deep like an ode, and dark as if dipped in death-shadow.

The guard tried to shrug him off, his bearded face looked afraid.
 His eyes, a light blue, stared at Rodregas with revulsion.
 He was probably wondering how Rodregas could be strong enough to take on an Immortal Guard.
 Rodregas knew from the guard’s fear that he had him, he was not thinking clearly.
 Rodregas growled at him, letting him feel his anger and rage at taking slaves to be used by the Immortalists.
 Rodregas had seen what would happen to them.
 He had suffered for years with a subtle kind of inner rot at letting the evil continue.
 In all the ways that mattered Rodregas knew he was no better than this man, he had spent most of his life as a slaver.
 Rodregas had no moral grounds on which to kill these men, but inside of him there was no mercy.
 He had crossed a line and could no longer live with the evil.

He'd begun feeling smothered.
 Gina had talked of nothing but marriage from their fifth or sixth date until he'd broken up with her.
 She'd sobbed and told him over and over how much she loved him and begged him not to break up with her.
 A month later he'd read of her engagement to another man.
 He'd actually proposed to Kim, but once she had the ring, all she'd wanted to talk about was what pieces she was going to buy to refurnish the house and at which resorts they were going to spend their summers and how much of his money was in the bank and how much in land investments.
 He'd broken up with her six weeks after proposing.
 He'd never gotten the ring back, of course.
 He was lonely.
 Rick sighed, setting down the carton of fried rice and leaning back.
 That was why he’d been foolish enough to ask Kim to marry him, he now realized.

I would hand him a bottle of water and tell him I would wait.
 He was never truly clean.
 When he slept, I went into the bedroom to see if his chest was inflating with air to assure me he was still alive.
 It reminded me of when our boys were babies and sometimes we would check on them in the night or as they napped and we never left the room until we verified they were breathing just because that is what a parent does.

 As Thanksgiving approached, our traditions looked impossible to pull off.
 We were evasive when we called my wife’s parents to tell them not to come to our house as they usually did.
 We said we had some personal family issues to deal with.
 We could tell their feelings were hurt, but we didn’t feel we had any other choice.
 We did allow my younger brother Harry in on the whole awful situation and invited him to come to the house as planned.

Qurrah shoved the cadaver onto its side, curled underneath, and then let it fall atop him.
 The weight crushed his fragile body and the smell was awful, but it was his only cover.
 Miserable, he hid there, quietly whispering.

 His tears fell to the grass.
 “Harruq, I need you.

“I had a dream last night,” I began.
 “Only it wasn't really a dream, but more of a vision.” Seth nodded.
 “What was it about?” I told him about the cliff and how Kojas had killed the dwarf.
 I hesitated but told him what Kojas said about him too, and I saw him stiffen.
 “I'm sorry,” I found myself saying.
 Seth shook his head.
 “It's not your fault that he said those things about me.
 I'm happy you didn't try to keep it from me.” “What should we do?” I asked desperately.
 “Well we know that the dwarf is dead and that Kojas knows we're here,” Seth said.
 “We also know he's going to be looking for all of us.” “So?” “So?” Seth mimicked and smiled.

“I guess not.” “We should move,” he said.

 “It’s too late now Jazell, I just swore by the Bible.
 Kojas means business and if he wants this to be a war, I’ll give him a war.” Then he stormed into the trees and disappeared.
 “Wait, Seth!” I yelled and ran into the trees.
 I scanned the trees.

The double doors leading to the private solar were also of Night Bronze, however the door was covered in intricate wards and symbols.
 The guardsmen's armor was less decorated and held only an engraving of their sigil animals.
 The guard on the right had an engraving on his Pauldrons, the piece of armor that protects his shoulders of the Celestial beast know as The Stag while the man on the left had an engraving of The Mastiff.
 After a moment, that seemed to stretch longer than was polite, the Immortal Guard to the right slowly nodded and with no hand touching it; the two massive doors opened to welcome him into the sanctum.
 Van’dret hurried through the open doors before the guard changed his mind.
 He normally found the sight of the Immortal Guards reassuring; the great sigil warriors were sworn to the protection of Immortalist, like himself, but he knew these two would cut him down like a common pauper if they sensed he was a danger to their Master.
 There was a short hallway leading from the doors with slim white columns on each side of the hallway, in between each column hung great pieces of art; paintings, sculptures and even a small wall hanging with amazing vibrant colors with a strange abstract design were all preserved in the space.
 Van’dret was a man of some refinement and appreciation for art, and he wished he had dared to stop and inspect the pieces; they had to be some of the greatest art works in the Realm to be so on display where only those who had been invited to a private meeting with Taiga would see them.
 However Van’dret dared to do nothing more than glance at them as he hurried forward.

It twisted out of Seth’s grip and fell to the ground.

 It slammed into Seth’s side and he fell to the ground.

For example, in India more than 10 million farmers are successfully engaged in sugarcane cultivation, precisely because an established system of contract farming provides them with access to technology, quality inputs, credit and an assured market for their produce.
 India became the world leader in milk production only because of the power of scale conferred on small producers through the dairy cooperative movement.
 A similar organization is presently lacking for most other crops.
 The successful establishment of more than one million Self-Help Groups (SHGs) in India over the past three years providing access to credit for 15 million small farmers illustrates the power of organization.
 It is an indication that the phase of society’s predominant dependence on government initiatives for development is coming to a close.
 An organization combining the advantages of SHGs and contract farming through the agency of an NGO or an agri-business centre operated by farm and home science graduates or entrepreneurs can be successfully extended to other crops, providing the technical knowledge and essential inputs that small farmers need to raise productivity and farm incomes.
 Crop Diversification: Eradicating hunger necessitates shifting production from traditional crops to higher value added crops that can improve nutrition, while generating higher on-farm incomes and greater off-farm employment.
 Fruits and vegetables can remove micro-nutrient deficiencies, while dairy and poultry can eliminate protein deficiencies.
 The soaring price of petroleum, which has reached historical highs this year, presents an additional opportunity for countries such as India to become large scale producers and exporters of bio-fuels and bio-mass energy, thereby substituting imported petroleum with lucrative markets, higher incomes and greater employment opportunities for the rural population.
 Contract farming arrangements between small producers and agri-business centres can stimulate rapid development of this field.

The person pinning Rodregas’ left arm got too far away.
 This gave Rodregas the leverage he needed to pull the arm free.
 He punched his assailant hard in the face.
 The attacker flew back and Rodregas jumped sideways to get more space.
 Rodregas rested his right hand on the knife blade still sticking out of his stomach.
 He was relieved to feel that it was not too deep.
 He had not taken off his armor.
 Although the knife had pierced the leather weave, the tip penetrated less than an inch.

All these arrangements have been based on the concept of competitive security.
 The competitive security paradigm is a state-centred, egocentric approach in which the security of each nation is perceived in terms of its military superiority over potential adversaries.
 The push of each nation for unlimited security through military power is inherently destabilizing, since it inevitably increases the level of insecurity of other sovereign states.
 In practice, the effort of nations to arm themselves against perceived external threats generates a sense of insecurity among other nations and compels them in turn to increase military preparedness, thus initiating a vicious spiral, as it did during the Cold War.
 When NATO and the Warsaw Pact had armed themselves to the point where direct confrontation became too risky, mutual suspicion and insecurity led them to fight each other through proxy wars in the developing world.
 Every move by either side was perceived as a potential security threat, prompting a counter by the other.
 Compounded by the inherent instability of nuclear weapons, this doctrine led to the anomaly of increasing military power and steadily decreasing national and international security.
 This highly militarized approach contains an in-built mechanism for escalation that was responsible for the growth of global military expenditure to an all-time peak of $1.2 trillion in 1988.
 Even when effective in controlling direct aggression between major powers, it encouraged proxy wars and it completely ignored the security needs of countries not aligned with one bloc or another.
 This is one of the reasons why all the wars in the last forty years have taken place in developing countries.

 military trend was not based on circumstances but must have been for some time starting in 1982, because it has happened so often, since war in that region has been ongoing for years. Moreover, many maritime conflicts have been fought in regions such as Agri-M and the Great Boda Basin, due to

“See any good Infernal sigils for me?” Rodregas asked.
 “I should bind my Infernal gift as well, especially as I will never be a great magician.” Rodregas had not really expected an answer, but Doi’van surprised him by nodding his great head and pointing to the far back almost in a corner that strangely was the only one in shadow.
 “I think the Ni’Barrbari, the daemon known as the Night Panther, would add a bit of subtly to your Celestial Lion.
 While hunters, they are also healers and not as vicious as most of the others.
 It might also cause less confusion if you are able to gain both Infernal and Celestial great sigils to have ones that share some similarities.” Rodregas nodded and walked toward where Doi’van had pointed, having to circle around what appeared to be a bear with the front feet of a stork and the over large head of an owl.
 Rodregas felt his skin crawl and he almost left the chamber, but then the cat shape behind the daemon became clear.
 The Daemonic shape seemed to be missing the odd combinations of the others.
 It looked like the large Panthers he had heard of that were found in the southern jungles.

Hour after hour passed in silent misery, until finally the rest of the kids wore themselves out and it quieted down enough for me to lapse into a fitful sleep.
 I was smack-dab in the middle of a dream about Rachel and Britney when everything changed.
 Ever so slowly, the normal dreamscape took on a sharp-edged glow, and then morphed into the breathtaking colors that'd wormed their way even deeper into my heart than I'd realized.
 I didn't recognize my surroundings, but they were different than any of the places I'd been before.
 The new scents whipping past me on the breeze were sign enough even if I hadn't been able to detect the subtle differences in the light emanating off of the foliage paving the trail I was walking along.
 For the length of the dream I lost myself in the wonder of experiencing the world in all of its amazing depth.
 Still, even the pure delight in my surroundings wasn't enough to mute the feeling something was missing.

Brother Lawrence’s attitude troubles me, because he persistently challenges his readers to follow his example, to live in, and for, daily, hourly, continuous communion with God.
 And I don't.
 The book’s message could be viewed as a commentary on Paul’s admonition, in Thessalonians 5:17, to “pray without ceasing”.
 Brother Lawrence attempts to show that ceaseless prayer looks and feels like constant communion and conversation with a person such as a mentor, who is always at our side, and whom we adore.
 Where I'm stuck is: the Brother explains that his desire to live in faithful, relentless companionship with God began with adoration.
 I wish I knew French and could read the original.
 But it has taken me decades to gain a meager command of Spanish.
 So I resort to an English dictionary, look up "adore" and all I find are synonyms: worship; revere, venerate; and one somewhat helpful description: deep, rapturous love.
 That one rings truest.
 According to my vocabulary, if we adore something, we are drawn to it and resist separation.

 "I swear, you've become more absentminded lately than ever before.
 As much time as you spend studying and thinking about your classes, I'm surprised they haven't decided to graduate you a year early."

 Since Mom hadn't been interested in the things I could safely tell her without getting grounded, school had become a standard excuse for why I was so distracted.

 You know, keeping you from patrolling or something."
 That last bit hadn't really been planned.
 I'd wanted to come downstairs and talk to him, but wouldn't have dreamt of just saying it outright.
 Maybe it was the natural high I got simply from being around him.
 Alec's smile was brief, but it felt like the first one I'd seen since he'd been forced to save me.

 Tell me what was true. Most, you know," went on about my mebaffled love union with Isabel regarding him "I wish I were a catch up boy," she said. Then she dropped down to her knees, turning around and crossing her knees over her chest."

Art – You’re correct, there is no reason to be rude, and this is hardly the place for obscene language.
 I just have other things on my mind this day, but I will try to watch what I say.
 I humbly apologize for my rudeness.
 Ned – No hard feelings.
 Personal problems eh?
 Art – Personal problems.
 I apologize once again.
 And now I return to my problems.
 Ned – Excuse me, but I might be able to help you.
 Art – Might you now?

They kept talking, settling into conversation.
 Steed offered Chevelle what was left of the roast and they sat, Chevelle beside me and Steed across from us.
 I picked up the canteen and choked down more wine.
 The evening carried on and though the conversation still held a formal tone, neither man talking of anything personal, they seemed to be getting along.
 I faded in and out of the various discussions, listening occasionally but never talking.
 Steed seemed very aware of me, watching me in a way no one ever had.
 It must have been obvious, because when he excused himself to check the herd, Chevelle studied me, sliding a strand of my now-black hair through his fingers.
 “It suits you.” It was a familiar gesture and it should have made me flinch.
 Maybe it was the wine, but as I looked at him, my anger was fading.
 The way he’d reacted when Fannie had struck me, the caress against my cheek, those were not the actions of a council elder.

“No, don’t feel bad for me.
 With you in such a position.” I didn’t know what she meant exactly, but she continued, “And my dear brother has been there for me all along, helping me with the elf parts.” She kept talking as she leaned forward, seemingly unaware I’d not spoken a word in response.
 Not that she’d given me much opportunity.
 I contemplated whether this was her usual behavior toward strangers or if she felt we had a special motherless bond.
 She ran her finger through the substance in the canister and it came out coated in a deep, dark green that had the consistency of grease, which she smeared across the base of my eyelid.
 She continued rambling as she coated various parts of my body with lotions and powders, smoothed my hair with a sweet-scented cream, painted my lips with a soft balm that smelled of spice.
 After she ran out of areas to work with, she opened a tall glass container with black liquid inside and dipped a cut braid of hair into the bottle.
 She drew it out, using the tip to brush an intricate design on the inside of my wrist.
 When she was finished, she leaned over and blew gently on the paint.
 Or ink?

Something about that nagged at me, but Ruby waited while I searched for a response.
 Chevelle opened the door and I knew I was saved from at least that much.
 When he saw me, he was struck still.
 I had forgotten Ruby’s “treatments” until she squealed in delight at his response.
 He composed his face again, but she’d already marked him.
 “Oh, you like it.
 She’s fabulous, isn’t she?” She was so proud of herself, but I could tell Chevelle was embarrassed he’d been caught off guard.
 It might have pleased me too, except that I couldn’t tell if it was less how I had changed and more the resemblance to my mother.
 Ruby offered Chevelle a drink and he sat in a chair beside mine.
 She prattled as she enjoyed the wine, and I tried to focus on her stories instead of the occasional glances he threw my way.

The earth beneath me was warm, the sun shining bright.
 I watched as a bird flew high overhead.
 It was gliding, slow and steady on the wind.
 As I shielded my eyes with a hand, I noticed the ink on my wrist and smiled.
 I suddenly knew the soaring creature above was a hawk.
 I closed my eyes and relaxed my arm at my side, imagining flying.
 I breathed deep and conjured the image it would see, looking down on us.
 The picture was sharp, even at this distance, but the colors weren’t as clear, and the outlying shapes not as defined.
 I laughed at myself for adding that detail to my daydream, imagining a bird seeing differently.
 My vision sailed over us, past the ridge, south.

He avoided pacing near me the rest of the evening, throwing me odd glances now and again.
 I shrugged it off and went back to reading.

Of course you'd have better vision too."
 It wasn't until I heard the note of longing in my voice that I realized what I was missing.
 Alec didn't have that same advantage, and I could feel him waiting expectantly.
 "Sorry, it's just that this all makes me think of these amazing dreams I've been having since I arrived.
 I'm transported to various places, but in every case I can hear and smell better than I can in real life.
 Not only that, everything is glowing.
 Only that isn't the right word for it.
 Mostly there's just light coming out of the people and the plants and animals.

I snuck over there plenty of times.

 “But you have yet to face men in combat,” Qurrah said.
 “Do not be overzealous about your skills.
 Confident, perhaps, but not foolish.
 Don’t die on me, brother, for I need you more than ever.”
 “Yeah, I know,” Harruq said, growing quiet.
 The subject of Qurrah’s experiments always made him uneasy.

 “What’s that?”

“She is probably right,” Rodregas said.
 “If someone who was a squire did manage to get a sigil he would be tempted to come back and earn the title and the prestige of knighthood.” “It does not matter if they are of the blood or minor sigils warriors; either way there are clearly a few who will be a challenge physically.
 But that is not the problem.
 Either way you should be physically more powerful.
 It is the nature of the competitions that I am worried about.” Doi’van paused as he ordered the coming conversation in his mind.
 Rodregas knew him well enough to wait until he was ready.
 Rodregas had been surprised when Doi’van had refused to take back his oath when they had had some privacy.
 Doi’van had simply said he took his oaths too seriously to play such games.
 So Rodregas had sworn the same oath to Doi’van, which Doi’van had accepted.
 Doi’van though was more focused on the task than the oath.

She felt like she was somehow to blame for not dying with her friends, and was reading all kinds of motivations into people's behavior that weren't even there.
 That would've been spooky enough, but then I'd turned around, linked all of it to a freak nightmare and been convinced the world was about to end.
 Silly.
 I did my best to comfort Britney after that, but was more than a little relieved when lunch finally ended.
 That of course made me feel heartless and guilty in turn, but I was still too fragile to deal with her issues.
 When it's all you can do to get through the day yourself, it's impossible to be a pillar of strength for someone else.

It’s all sex, right?
 And now I felt like part of the brotherhood.
 I wanted to write more songs—that’s the best part—I wanted to create.
 And I wanted more orgasms.

 And my gigs with my new band.
 Man, everything was happening.

Today was no different, which was a good thing since I probably wouldn't have done a very good job of explaining anything.
 Mrs. Campbell shut everything down before my shift started, and sent me home with a concerned look in her eye.
 Rachel skipped over to my table while I was still trying to get my books put away.
 "Guess what.
 I'm bringing pizza on the bus so we'll have something to eat on the way to Les Misérables.

 "You've never actually been on a school bus before, have you?"
 Rachel blushed a little bit.
 "Well, no not really.

Gaping mouths shrieked mindless wails, their voices bone-chilling and unrelenting.
 A few soldiers fired arrows, but most hid behind their shields.
 “Why do you cower?” Qurrah asked, striking his brother on the shoulder.
 “The skulls are nuisances, nothing more.”
 “Sorry,” Harruq muttered.
 He shivered as a skull sailed just above them, its screech turning to chaotic laughter.
 The sound raced up and down his spine, triggering fear no matter how irrational.
 Qurrah watched as if immune to the sound.
 He was so much smaller than Harruq, his slender body wrapped in rags, thin flesh clinging to bone.
 Yet he was unafraid.

As he searched for a way to scale the wall, he saw a drunken man watching him.
 “Get lost,” Harruq growled.
 The man obliged, taking his bottle of ale and running.
 That taken care of, the half-orc went around back where he found a few worn and uneven crates.
 He lifted one and approved of its strength after a simple test.
 Satisfied, he went back around and placed it against the wall.
 He was about to go back for a second when torchlight flooded the alley.
 “Move and you’ll find an arrow in your throat,” said a voice.
 “Pincushion him anyway,” urged another.
 Harruq held a hand before his eyes, cursing his awful luck.

 A yell set out and a shadow crossed across the doorway, pointing angrily back at him. He immediately frantically summoned something. Cramped him away, which he did. He pulled out and ran into a strange alley beneath the roof and realized it was some way down the hall. After a few

“It will not be safe to travel in my company,” he added.
 “I know,” stated the Hellborn in a voice that was so deep it was like stones grinding.
 “But still, I would travel with you.” Again he made the statement and showed no interest in explaining his action.
 “Actually,” added Imeralda shaking her long curly hair behind her as if to clear the way for her decision, “I was thinking the same thing.
 I am not safe from the Guild anyhow.
 My natural magical talent is very strong, and until I am better skilled in it, I am very vulnerable,” she stated “And frankly, while Audrian, Brit and Geor are very brave to let me travel with them, I fear that I put their lives in danger.
 You, on the other hand, are in more danger than I am, and should be even more motivated to stay out of the sight of the Guild.” After saying the little speech that she had clearly been practicing in her head, she added, “Joining you makes sense.” Rodregas hesitated, but she had an excellent point, and of course turning away such a beautiful young woman was a difficult thing to do.
 She did have a point and he did have a reasonably safe place to hide that he had been heading toward.
 So, even if he did head out on a raid of the Immortalists, she should be safe enough.
 The human men would be of least interest to the Guild and the easiest to blend in.

“I would not expect you to be moving around much yet.” Rodregas nodded.
 He could not explain that he already had a minor sigil of healing.
 He simply smiled and said, “I am too excited to lie down and groan in pain!
 My mind races with the possibilities.
 Now that I am officially a knight, I want to bring my sworn men into the chamber and figure out what sigils I will choose.” At his words the men’s faces tightened and they looked at his supposed servants.
 Rodregas nodded his understanding.
 He also knew from his own ‘illustrious’ career as a guard that the others would follow the rules.
 They were not officers to be making judgments.
 “I know you don’t like my servants being a Hellborn and a Nymph,” he said keeping his voice light.
 “But they are my sworn men and I trust them; and it is my call.

High above, the skulls quieted, and their fires dimmed.
 When the necromancer noticed Qurrah’s meddling, his mental link pulsed with incredible energy.
 Colors swarmed through his mind, dark purples and reds across a macabre canvas of black.
 He felt his chest tightening, his neck constricting.
 A scrying eye was upon him, now, and he was losing.
 It felt like an arrow pierced his mind, and through it words seeped into his head.

We human beings can become whatever we sincerely aspire to become.
 Looking back, it is astonishing how much the world has changed since the idea of establishing the International Commission on Peace and Food was first conceived in 1987. Who had the foresight to imagine the monumental changes which have so radically altered the political, economic and social complexion of the world community – the end of the nuclear arms race and the opposing military alliances of East and West, the rising tide of democracy that dramatically and irreversibly transformed the USSR and the countries of Eastern Europe, the growing importance of the UN in peace keeping and peace making, the peaceful end of apartheid in South Africa, the first tangible steps toward lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East, the completion of global trade negotiations and the founding of the World Trade Organization, and concerted actions to stem the degradation of the environment?
 The mid-1980s was a time when global military spending reached an all-time high of $1.2 trillion.
 Economic growth had slowed or stalled in much of the developing world, prompting some to term the 1980s the 'lost decade' for development.
 While there was little agreement on what steps were needed to reverse the arms race and provide a stable basis for world peace, a consensus was emerging that something must be done to address the urgent problems of hunger, famine and endemic poverty that continued to plague much of the developing world and constituted a gnawing source of instability that refused to be contained by national boundaries.
 The unconscionable loss of lives due to hunger in an age of plenty generated growing concern over the issues of food and famine.
 Starvation forced millions of people, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, to flee their homes in despair.
 It undermined social stability, fuelled violence and in some cases led to war between neighbours and fellow-countrymen.
 The effort to glean more food from desiccated earth further ravaged the environment and aggravated shortages.
 To this was added the galling sight of hunger amidst plenty, when adequate food production was not matched by sufficient job opportunities to provide incomes to all who needed to buy food because they could not grow their own.

 the late 1980s, hunger grew through a two-fold second evolution: famine continued to set up poverty as well as poverty in the great countries of the world. Meanwhile in the middle east and west the supply for staple goods were becoming more strained and when it became clear that without any international credit monetary

But when Marie came out of the dressing room complaining that the 32B was too tight, she wondered how she'd missed the girl's bust size by such a margin.
 Marie found that she loved shopping for modern lingerie.
 She liked lace and rich colors and chose black, emerald, fuchsia, and royal blue underwear.

The second wolf looked forward.
 He saw it, too, and abruptly pointed, calling out.
 But the howl echoed in my own ears, not my imagination, and I jolted upright.
 The field was in motion, rushing in response to the warning.
 In seconds, they were set again, the same protective positions they had taken the last time.
 The last time a tracker had found us.
 It was all I could do to steady myself as the councilman was brought forward, because he was the same one from my vision.
 I was in shock as he knelt, not under his own power, and was frozen there before us.
 How could I have seen him?
 Chevelle mumbled something and my ears began to ring, distracting me from bewilderment.

 their backing produced a fiercer glare and another shine, a silent twinge above even Filla herself. I watched in certain dread as she panted and let out hot at the other four wheels. Asda was finally pushed forward and it doubled across the field so I could see that empty space below

Maybe the wolf would be attracted to the noise and light.
 Maybe I'd be able to get far enough away it wouldn't smell me.
 I'd only been moving for about a minute before another howl sent chills running down my spine.
 It sounded like a different wolf, and it was closer than the first one.
 I tried to run faster, but all that time studiously avoiding exercise was working against me.
 I topped a slight rise and then tripped as the ground wasn't where I expected it to be.
 My jacket saved me from picking up any really serious scrapes this time, but just before I finished tumbling to a stop I slammed my head into a crescent-shaped rock.
 My vision swam in and out of focus, but I struggled to my feet, only to nearly fall again as my right ankle all but collapsed under me.
 They were definitely closer now.

It obviously hadn't crossed Mom's mind that they might decide to go with someone else.
 Waffling over whether or not to take the job was one thing when she was sure she'd have it in the end.
 It was entirely different when it might cost her the biggest break she'd ever had.
 She nodded jerkily as she stepped out of the room, already dialing.
 I felt my eyelids drooping by the time she came back.
 "They want me to leave right now.
 She said she's already arranged for a charter plane out of St. George.
 If I leave in the next ten minutes, we can make the flight out of Salt Lake International with something like half an hour to spare."
 We both sat there in silence for a few seconds as everything sank in, and then Mom exploded into motion.
 She ran downstairs to repack her photography equipment, all the while yelling upstairs to verify that I'd packed all of the other essentials she was going to need.

He laughed.
 The cold air helped a little.
 I was back in the circle, the group of us sitting around a small fire.
 Ruby was telling stories.
 She related the tale of Bonnie Bell, a blue fairy from the East.
 “He hunts the human children, luring them in with glitter and lights, and eats them, beginning with their tiny little toes.
 Though he gives no choice in the matter, in exchange, he allows the mother one wish.” I scoffed, “Humans aren’t real.” “Even so,” she continued, smiling wickedly, “you’d be surprised how many don’t think to wish for their children back.” Raucous laughter floated up around the ring.
 Fairy tales indeed.
 It felt good being there, surrounded by my new companions, a fire and stories, laughter.

 Other people do."
 "Really?

 He laid the chicken on the grill.

I turned around to see an entrance.
 I walked over and bent down.
 There seemed to be some kind of sign or symbol.
 It was two circles with a sword through the center of both.
 “Seth, look!” I said and pointed to it.
 He came over and bent down, tracing the sign with his finger.
 I waited and finally said, “Well, do you know what it is?” Seth dropped his finger.
 “It means, 'slayer of worlds'.
 Does that ring a bell?” “How do you know that?” I asked.
 He shrugged.

He might spot us.” As she spoke Rodregas noticed that Imeralda had a strange expression on her face, she was scared, but also seemed sad.
 “What kind of slaves do they have?” Rodregas asked in a gentle voice.
 Her body jerked more directly toward him, surprise covering her sad expression for a second.
 “Mixed, of course, human, AElfin.
 But, Rodregas, they have Forest and Earth Nymphs and several are children.
 I was raised among AElfin, but these are my people.
 I wish we could do something.“ Rodregas nodded his understanding and said, “I wish we could, but the three of us against a score, the chances of our success is far smaller than the chances of our death.” He stated in the ‘matter of fact’ sergeant voice that he knew people would follow.
 Rodregas stood up and started to turn, but while Doi’van stood he faced the road and he said, “I have been on this road before, though I did not know then that it was called ‘The Princess Road.’ To me it was a road of sorrow.” Doi’van was using that flat voice that he used when stating facts.
 “Rodregas, you said our odds are bad, but how long shall we wait for the odds to be good?” Doi’van’s voice dropped the flat tone and started to sound like rocks groaning deep in the earth, as if a great earthquake was coming, “You believe that a god of the Celestials is behind your survival and that this god wants to see us fight the Immortalists.
 I spent two years of my life in the Menagerie, I swore to myself that given a chance I would see no others be enslaved by the Lord Taiga.” Doi’van continued speaking with the same tone as if the earth shook, “I know these caravans.

It did not take long before a group of soldiers spotted them.
 “Show them no mercy, Aurelia,” Felewen said, her warm voice turning cold.
 “They will die with little suffering,” the sorceress responded.
 “It’s the most I can give.”
 Electricity arced between her hands.
 Blue fire surrounded her eyes.
 The five human soldiers raised their shields and charged as a single unit.
 Felewen stood next to Aurelia, her sword high and her armor gleaming.
 She kept the blade out and pointed at the center soldier.
 When the bolt of lightning came shrieking out from Aurelia’s hands, that same soldier found himself lifted from the ground, his hands flailing, his useless sword and shield falling.

Once that several of the few shots fired from the catapult exploded, a powerful bolt of telepathy from Aurelia sent another vibrant explosion into the air.<eop> With a breathless sigh, felewen watched the advancing shields chase the flames through her

The ban on use should be followed by urgent measures to dismantle and scrap this entire class of weapons worldwide.
 Technically, a prohibition on testing and deployment of ballistic missiles would be far more verifiable than any limits on nuclear proliferation.
 Monitoring stations at missile production facilities and existing surveillance systems can restrain manufacture and detect test flights.
 Evading a ban on testing would be practically impossible.
 Small Arms, Drugs, Crime and Terrorism
 Four decades of preoccupation with nuclear weapons have blinded policy makers to an extremely dangerous and destabilizing threat to nations and their citizenry from the other end of the weapons spectrum – the proliferation of small arms.
 The shift in the nature of conflicts from massive wars between states by regular armed forces over a wide region or encompassing the globe to small, inter-state or intra-state warfare by irregular forces, insurgents, criminal or terrorist groups infiltrating and often indistinguishable from the general population has led to a frighteningly swift and widespread proliferation of small arms.
 This category includes weapons up to 50 mm calibre, high-powered automatic personal weapons such as the AK-47 Kalashnikov, sophisticated explosives, and shoulder-fired rockets, grenades and surface-to-surface missiles.
 The transfer of small arms takes place through diverse channels – formal and clandestine trade, legal and black or grey markets, and local manufacture.
 These weapons provide the means to support and sustain low-intensity (but highly lethal) conflict.

I glared at him, “Nice story Seth, now what really happened?” He didn’t say anything and he rode ahead to get beside Jason, who was in the lead.
 The park slowly came in view.
 It was a huge grass circle with a small play set in the middle covered in kids.
 The woods surrounded it except for the side that faced the street.
 A fountain was near the entrance along with a bike rack.
 That’s where we parked our bikes.
 I clicked the lock together and grabbed my bag.
 Emily was fumbling with her bike lock, which was old and rusted and usually refused to work without a fight.
 I walked over and tried to help her.
 “Why do you think Seth won’t tell us what he was doing?” I asked, watching her because she had refused to let me help.

 Pierre decided it was time to go upstairs and relieved the way to the stairs and saying to Lisa that he’d be the first person and whoever get into the park, he started to walk. All he the way through the entrance gate to the last step in the designated place, Beth was immediately behind

“You know the great beasts of the Celestial Realm are not just magical animals.
 They are more.
 They are the embodiment of magic, of ideas or concepts for the Celestials: The Great White Stag, The Moon Wolf, The Lion, The Stallion.
 Dire beasts are animals with magic and they are more powerful, smarter, and stronger because of their magic.
 Celestial Beasts are far more.
 You saw that for yourself didn’t you?” she asked softly.
 Rodregas simply nodded.
 It was interesting what she said, but he was not sure why she was bringing it up at this time.

 Jim – I didn’t go to that because my swimsuit makes me look fat.
 Liz – Jim…
 Jim – Alright, your mother makes me extremely uncomfortable, with all her little smiles and suggestions and the pinching.
 With that on top of my swimsuit making me look fat, well I just didn’t feel up to it.

“You’re going to be beating my ass in a few weeks if you keep learning as fast as you are.”
 “Don’t worry,” she said, patting his hand.

 Harruq laughed at the absurdity.
 Aurelia, meanwhile, absently drew lines in the dirt.
 He watched for a moment, suddenly nervous and quiet.
 The words of his brother echoed in his head.

I’ve always been near water.
 What does this mean?
 Nothing.
 But it made for interesting song material.
 I like some of the lyrics, which are a little plain, despite the ornate title of the song.
 CM:  	And, that’s just you and your guitar.
 BG:  	Right.
 Actually, recorded here at home, right over there, in the corner by the bookcases.
 I set up a mike in the corner, turned my back to the room, and used the wall of books as organic echo, a trick, I’m sure you know, that Robert Johnson employed to get his idiosyncratic vocal style.
 CM: 	No, I didn’t know that.

Go ahead and tell everyone the tutoring session is canceled, and I'll see you tomorrow.
 --Nora Campbell I sat motionless for several seconds before realizing this was the out I needed.
 If I could pull myself together enough to cancel the lab, I could go home and self-destruct without ruining the scattered shards left of my life.
 "The lab has been canceled for today.
 I'm sorry, everyone, but most of the tutors are sick and Mrs. Campbell had to go to a meeting after school.
 Everything should be back to normal tomorrow though."
 I expected everyone to jump to their feet and all but run out of the room.
 I didn't expect what I actually got.
 "Who are you and why on earth should we believe you?
 The last thing I want to do is go home and get in trouble for cutting tutoring again."

What was I doing?
 He released his grip just a fraction.
 “I went to your room and you were gone.” He shook his head.
 “I thought I had to come out here to get a search party.” “I, uh… you were in my room?” He straightened, his expression making it clear he hadn’t expected that response.
 I pressed, taking the chance.
 “Why?” I heard movement behind me and the fear returned tenfold.
 Chevelle didn’t tense; he only let out an exasperated breath.
 “It’s fine,” he said.
 He released me and I turned to see who he’d addressed.
 Four figures stood in a line, almost a formation, and they relaxed at his words.

Her legs were killing her but she wasn't going to tell Jason that.
 He got up and sat at the base of the tree.
 “You had to take the good tree?” She motioned around.
 “There are plenty of trees to pick from Jason.
 So pick one.” He mumbled something and closed his eyes.
 Emily shook her head.
 He was too stubborn sometimes.
 Emily stared at the sky and then she knew what he had said.
 She looked down to say something but Jason was fast asleep.
 He had said he wasn't going to leave her alone.

 Emily wanted? Jason didn't know that but what Kyle Roberts wanted her like right now? He was not going to leave Emily alone. What did he want? That was what he wanted, Emily. What Kyle Richards wanted was someone who had a damn good chance of winning the battle. "

There was a tease to her voice and expression that said she knew what he was thinking and that she did not mind.
 Rodregas was an experienced man but he was not sure if he had ever seen a woman as beautiful as her, much less thought that he ever had a chance with such a woman.
 He had to smile, amused by his own reaction, as he felt his heartbeat speed up and a rush of heat.
 He had not felt such hormonal surges in a long time.
 He made a decision in his head.
 He had carefully been a gentleman now for several weeks and had not tried anything with the beautiful half AElf, but her teasing expression left him an opening.
 He decided to take advantage of it.
 He spoke very slowly and carefully, letting her know that he knew what he was saying.
 “Actually, I was looking at you, you are amazingly beautiful.
 Your incredible eyes and hair, you are breathtaking.” Rodregas looked at her, his eyes going slowly over her entire body as he spoke.

If he could close the gap, the bow would prove no match for his longsword.
 Another arrow struck an inch from his left foot.
 His leg was aflame, yet he continued to charge, pulling back his shield so his sword could lash out.
 But the elf was not close enough, and he was more skilled with a bow than in just firing arrows.
 He snapped the wood up, cracking Antonil across the bottom of his hand, which held firm to his blade.
 Undaunted, the elf stepped closer, ducked underneath the guard captain’s return swing, and then kicked at the arrow still lodged in his shin, finally making Antonil drop his blade.
 The elf stood, drawing an arrow as he did.
 Antonil, now lying on the ground, struggled to bring his shield over his chest.
 Part of it caught beneath his side and would not come.
 He would not be able to block in time.

Dean started reading seriously in the second grade due to a competition and has spent most of the subsequent three decades lost in other people's worlds.
 Things worsened, or improved depending on your point of view, when he first started experimenting with writing while finishing up his accounting degree.
 These days Dean has a wonderful wife and two lovely daughters to keep him rather more grounded, but the idea of bringing others along with him as he meets interesting new people in universes nobody else has ever seen tends to drag him back to his computer on a fairly regular basis.

 Jim – If everyone knew about him it would change how the acted towards him.
 They would treat him like he was special and give him more lee-way.
 Johnny – So, where’s the downside to that?
 Jim – It’s just not Gene’s way.
 He likes to create a nuisance and a spectacle.

Time flew by all too quickly.
 Soon it was just me holding down the fort and trying to take care of a trio of freshmen girls who seemed to be at least slightly ahead of the normal cramming curve.
 I was glad they weren't waiting until the day before the test to come in for help, but it was looking like tomorrow wasn't going to be any fun.
 Maybe I'd get lucky again, and most of the lazy ones would give up before my shift started.
 I turned around from explaining for the fourth time to the third person why you couldn't prove congruence of two triangles with the nonexistent angle-angle-angle postulate, only to find that Britney had slipped out of the room.
 It was possible she'd just gone to the restroom.
 I tried to remind myself of all of the places she could be, and all of the reasons she might have left that didn't involve abandoning me here.
 Rachel met me on my way back to my table to gather up my books.
 "She left with Rick Anders."
 I mustered a grin.

“You look like you’ll need shelter, sunshine,” he explained.
 I stared in disbelief as the trees split to form a low lean-to.
 He shot me another wink; I couldn’t be sure he was kidding.
 The tearing and popping noises ceased, and I examined his creation.
 Quite impressive really.
 He didn’t even seem to be watching, let alone concentrating.
 And no blessings on it, no thanks to Mother Earth.
 It seemed he was just enjoying himself, not being responsible to the magic.
 Magic that I needed.
 That I wanted.

“Stay.
 Still.” He was gone.
 He moved so fast it took a moment to understand.
 The hood of the cloak was drawn over my head, Chevelle standing a good distance away, facing the trees.
 I was watching him as two men drew near.
 I hadn’t seen them; they must have been concealed, or camouflaged by magic as I had been days before.
 The tassels decorating their long robes identified them as members of council, but I wasn’t familiar with the two.
 They mustn’t have been from the village.
 As they approached Chevelle cautiously, I examined their insignia.
 Even if they weren’t from the village, I still needed council members to unbind me, and I had a sudden urge to go to them.

Of course it was possible he'd forgotten to make the arrangements, but somehow I doubted it.
 Mom looked like she was starting to waver.
 "It does seem like a great opportunity, but there just isn't any good way to know for sure it's legitimate."
 That didn't sound like Alec at all.
 "Are you sure, Mom?
 They didn't arrange anything you could use to verify they're for real?"
 I suddenly realized why parents got such a big kick out of catching their kids doing something wrong.
 Mom looked so sheepish I almost laughed.
 "Well, he did say he'd arrange for an immediate advance to be wired over to our bank, but it's closed on Saturdays, and it isn't like I can go calling up the bank president for something trivial like that."
 I opened my mouth, still unsure what to say in response to her latest excuse, only to be interrupted by her cell phone again.

 "Don't care about you." An incredibly down response. No reason for a kid to get upset about their parents. Because Melissa was so right. Parents worry about kids and find all out what was going on with them. Parents did not need their 'victims'being settled

But the lessons of the past decade should caution us against accepting as a fait accompli statistical projections that predict the outcome of our effort over the next ten years before it has even begun.
 No such determinism exists, except in our minds.
 Given the right leadership, we can change the course, amend the rules, alter the structures and accelerate action to achieve an entirely different and more favourable set of outcomes.
 Our future is not a question of fate.
 It is a question of choice.
 Evolutionary Opportunities
 What then is the justification for predicting a bright future?
 There are political, economic, social and technological forces active in the world today that can override the causality of past trends and combine together to make this a time of unprecedented opportunity.

That was, of course, until my father.

 Chevelle approached during his pacing and I slid the book into my pack, pretending to examine the beading on the material of the dress.
 This seemed to disturb him.
 He avoided pacing near me the rest of the evening, throwing me odd glances now and again.
 I shrugged it off and went back to reading.

His mind was nearly overwhelmed by the sudden tearing sensation that hit him.
 Blood splattered from two horrid gashes along his forearms, soaking the carpet crimson.
 He collapsed to one knee, his hands latched around his sword.
 He tried to raise the blade, but all the strength had left his hands.
 He had lost too much blood.
 When Harruq came charging forward, Condemnation red and hungry, all he could do was dodge.
 Condemnation shattered what remained of the table.
 The elf rolled, his arms tucked against his chest.
 When he pulled out of the roll, he dashed for a large dresser.
 Inside was a stash of healing potions.

Harruq stepped into the alley beside the tavern and looked up.

 The man obliged, taking his bottle of ale and running.
 That taken care of, the half-orc went around back where he found a few worn and uneven crates.
 He lifted one and approved of its strength after a simple test.
 Satisfied, he went back around and placed it against the wall.
 He was about to go back for a second when torchlight flooded the alley.

Jim  - This all actually happened, and you were out of it, you forgot to pay the bills for three months, and if you recall you wouldn’t take the time to eat unless either Gene, Liz or I brought you something and nagged till you finished it.

 It doesn’t seem all that important to eat when your world is falling apart.
 How long did it take for Gene to finally snap?
 Jim  - He started spending a lot of time hanging out at their church doing bible lessons.
 He actually applied himself to it, and was pretty good at debating the bible and other religious topics in just a couple of months.
 Gene turned Conservative Christian, it was kind of scary for several months.

Rosarie, she believed, wielded demonic powers.
 In twilight, Eric and I climbed up from the beach and explored some caves.
 After dark, we rested atop the cliff, in a little park a half mile from the Cabrillo lighthouse.
 Eric paced, finally sat down, and asked what I’d been thinking about my dad that day.
 I told him how Christmas was always my dad’s favorite day, how the only plants he ever grew were poinsettias he would deliver to the family graves every Christmas morning after the presents got exchanged and breakfast was over.
 When I finished, Eric paced again.
 Then he squatted in front of the bench where I sat and gazed hard at me, as though wondering how far I could be trusted.
 After deciding in my favor, he said, “There’s a big change coming.
 I don’t know what it will be.
 It’s something I feel so deeply, like nothing I ever felt before.

Harruq pressed closer, and every time the elf pulled out of a roll or landed from a leap backward, he was upon her.
 Notch after notch covered her staff as the swords chopped harder and harder.
 His strength grew as the fight progressed.
 He held nothing back.
 He weaved his swords through three stabs, feinted a high slash, and then twirled up and around for a low thrust.
 Aurelia fell for the feint and brought her staff up high, leaving her lower half exposed.
 Her slender frame twisted.
 A sword cut a thin line across the green fabric of her dress but did not touch skin.
 She thought Harruq might stop and claim the cut counted.

Qurrah had a solution but it was far from pleasant.
 Most likely he would die, but he had to try.
 He heard no screams coming from around the corner, but he knew that meant nothing.
 He had to believe his brother was still alive.

 Qurrah took out his last healing potion, popped the cork, and then held it before him.
 Blood was beginning to fill his throat once more.
 His stolen energy was quickly fading.
 He had no time to waste.

Then the blades fell.
 On the half-orc ran.
 Innocent blood stained his sword as life after life ended.

 Man, woman, child, it didn’t matter.
 They all died.
 Only seven managed to keep ahead of his berserking madness: a mother, her two children, a few farmers, and their daughters.
 They dared to hope.

My mouth tasted sour.

 Before I’d moved an inch I was back down.

 My eyes opened again to find Chevelle offering me a glass.

The person pinning Rodregas’ left arm got too far away.
 This gave Rodregas the leverage he needed to pull the arm free.
 He punched his assailant hard in the face.
 The attacker flew back and Rodregas jumped sideways to get more space.
 Rodregas rested his right hand on the knife blade still sticking out of his stomach.
 He was relieved to feel that it was not too deep.
 He had not taken off his armor.
 Although the knife had pierced the leather weave, the tip penetrated less than an inch.
 Rodregas gritted his teeth and pulled the knife free.
 From the feel of its balance, it was not a real fighting weapon, but only a simple utility knife.

Splintered Excerpt Alec had been promising to take me somewhere new for nearly a week, but pack business kept getting in the way.
 I'd been expecting some posh restaurant in Vegas or maybe LA.
 The world kind of becomes your oyster when you've got your own jet.
 The last thing I'd expected was a picnic up at the top of the mountain that cradled the Graves' estate between large, rocky spurs.
 It was perfect.
 For Alec money was nothing more than a useful tool, but he understood I still wasn't comfortable having that tool used to purchase me things I didn't really need.
 I'd set out determined to hike the whole way up to the top, but I was still a little weak.
 Apparently everyone had been right about just how much blood I'd lost the night our pack had destroyed the local rival pack.

 With his superhuman hearing and sense of smell, Alec knew I was struggling before I even did.

 They cohered, they veered away and came back, like the trajectory of stars.
 Buddy’s solos were like fluid silver; he was re-inventing the electric guitar.
 It was around this time that Buddy began writing songs.
 He was shy about it.
 No one knows how many he wrote before he brought the first one to the group, the one that would later be their most requested song, “I Love my Aunt Jemima.”  Soon, though, he was bringing in songs in coacervations, as if he had eons of them bubbling up.
 That first acceptance by the group opened the floodgates and Buddy Gardner became something of a songwriting machine.
 Other artists recorded many of his best things, a blessing, and he became a regular at Hi Studios, at Sun and later at Ardent.
 He was covered by many of the Mid-South’s biggest stars.

 I could definitely hear the rumble of a high-performance engine.
 I nodded again, and turned to go, hopeful that I could avoid the inevitable question of why Brandon was coming to pick me up in the mornings as well as dropping me off most afternoons.
 Unfortunately, Mom's hearing was nearly as good as mine, and she was walking towards the windows before I managed to get the door open.
 "Adri, who's that?"
 It was obviously one of those leading questions designed to see whether or not I'd try to lie.
 I shrugged.
 "His name is Brandon; he picks me up sometimes in the morning."
 I was saved from dealing with her response by Brandon's knock.

What happened there is shrouded in mystery, except Skippy recalls Buddy saying, “She had the most beautiful sex I’ve ever seen.
 It tasted like mushrooms and ginger ale.
 And its musk stayed on me for days, like it had gone subcutaneous, like it had replaced my own body odor.” Perhaps this was her hex: Ruthah: The perfume of Immortality.
 Others talk about the size and welcoming essence of Lorelei’s breasts.
 Buddy was mothered; he fed there like a suckling, like a child.
 It wasn’t love but it was something between the sacred and the profane.
 Some say Lorelei was responsible for the beginning of the slide downward for Buddy, filling his head with ideas of stardom, of leaving the backwash of Memphis and making it in a real town like L.A. or Boston.
 Buddy listened to Lorelei, we know that, for better or worse.
 Let’s hearken back to a happier image.

He had been waiting outside the town, and in the starlight the swathe of darkness rolling across the land had caught his eye.
 He had followed and from a distance observed the short meeting.
 His eyes flipped between the half-orcs and their master.
 His heart was torn.
 He had already warned Harruq that he would tolerate no strange behavior, yet he had given a similar warning to the man with the ever-changing face.
 “I do this for you, Aurelia,” he said, his decision made.
 He removed his bow and ran across the grass.
 Velixar had not moved since the brothers’ departure, his hands resting on the grass, palms upward.
 His hood fell far past his eyes, blocking nearly all of his face.

If we're not back before it starts odds are someone's going to die."
 CHET Whispers From the Past
 By Larry Murray
 Meet Charles Tucker, he has spent nearly 30 years living in denial, trying desperately to hide from his past and the events that shattered his heart beyond any possibility of healing.
 He can't let anyone close, for doing so would open him up to being hurt again, and there's no way he could survive another wounding.
 Meet the Saunders family, new to the neighborhood and teetering on the verge of bankruptcy.
 Mark, the father, talks a good story but is that all he is?
 His plan could hold the key to reversing his family's financial misfortunes, or it could wipe out everyone involved.
 Meet Chet, a battered old '64 Chevy pickup that was there on the night Charles' life imploded.
 For nearly three decades, he has been locked away in an old barn, safely out of sight if not completely out of mind.

 Shaw was there when old neighbor C. Thomas Saunders was forced to plow across the nearby yellow track in an accident causing Charles to commit suicide. Remember, "I saw hot da s com t and I couldn't think about the dead person's chest top." Meet Harriet

The power surged, and Alec's heavy, cool power was joined by something light and laughing.
 Several seconds later, Mallory released Alec with a sigh and fell back in obvious exhaustion.
 Alec watched intently until she shook her head, and then the mask fell for just a second before he locked it back in place, hiding the disappointment that for the slimmest of moments had been plainly written on his expression.
 Mallory reached out, as if to take Alec's hand, but he gently set her hands back on her lap.
 "Nothing's changed.
 We'll just proceed as before.
 Rest now, and should the worst come to pass I'll send Donovan to you."
 A few seconds later Alec and I were outside the cabin, walking back in the direction of the waiting motorcycle.
 I reached out to take his hand, and felt a glimmer of relief when he didn't reject the gesture as he had with Mallory.
 "Alec, was the letter from Donovan?"

 Jim – It’s only fun if you do it well, and then because of the rush you get when you pull it off.

 Remembering how awful that had been, she broke away.

"Like you wanted me to kiss you."
 He grinned again as he reached for the eggs.
 She frowned, trying to remember what expression she must have had on her face that night.
 But she hadn't been thinking about how she looked; she'd been thinking about how he looked.
 And how his lips would feel on hers.
 It was as they were cleaning up after breakfast that inspiration struck her.
 Handing him a tub of butter, she caught his gaze, holding it as she thought about the way he'd kissed her yesterday afternoon.
 Entranced by Marie's beautiful hazel eyes, Rick drew her close and bent his head to kiss her.
 Seconds later, he was startled by a giggle that interrupted their kiss.

I looked away.
 Steed broke in through the trees, gesturing toward the direction he’d come from.
 “They aren’t far.
 Ready and able for a morning adventure.” As he approached, he glanced at me and then Chevelle, still close beside me.
 “We can get an early start.” He lifted a pack from beside the fire and said, “Bluebell?” I stood, following this stranger without question, not missing the irritation on Chevelle’s face.
 He unclasped the pack to roll the blankets out with a flip, smiling and nodding good evening before stepping away from my hastily constructed hut.
 I unlaced my vest and threw it down, kicked off my shoes and fell into the blankets, stretching happily to finally have something like an actual bed.
 The conversation outside quieted and I slipped off to sleep, trying not to think about my capture and coming return to the village.
 “Freya.” A low voice broke into my dreams of gently rolling hills and soft gray stone.
 I peered through slitted eyes to see Chevelle standing outside the entrance, back to me as he watched a dull red horizon.

That’s what I think anyway.
 I mean, in the middle of Beatlemania, when he had the fucking world by the tail, we thought, he’s singing “Help me if you can.”  And nobody was listening man.
 He was a squonk crying in the wilderness.
 God love him.
 I think he’s happier now, doing his own shit, not having to answer to anybody except John Lennon.
 That’s the way I am.
 I mean, I’m not claiming to be Lennon—Jesus, no—but, I was always a solo artist and in the straightjacket of a group I was itching to get to the good stuff, the stuff I cared about.
 It’s not worth grousing about, I mean, I had a good run in that group, but my solo albums are the only ones I care about.
 So, sophomore year, Debby is gone—well, I cut her loose, I’m not proud of it.

He didn't have a big collection of movies, and he didn't think it would be a good idea to take her out to rent one right now.
 "Why don't we see what's on television?"
 "The box?"
 "Yes."
 "Don't you watch talkies on it?"
 "Well, sort of.
 The programs aren't like movies--well, some of them are.
 Most programs are shorter--half an hour or an hour."
 He went to get the TV guide and found the listing for Saturday evening.

Art – Your mother used to look at me the same way.
 Jim – Oh wonderful, mother looked at you the same way.
 Was that before or after she informed you that you ruined her life and were damned to spending an eternity in hell?
 If Liz is looking at me like that…Why am I still even alive?
 Maybe she’s coming up with some terrible forms of torture for me.
 Art – It was when we first met, before she changed.
 That happened well before you were born smart-ass.
 Your mother was a loving gentle woman.
 And she looked at me in a special way.

An art gallery.
 Several pedestals with ‘art’, one being a cardboard box supposedly filled with ceramic pieces.
 And several paintings are on display.
 The art work all has spotlights on it, in addition to the regular lighting.
 Several people are looking at the creations and acting like they are holding conversations as they move about and look at the exhibit.
 Liz and her mom are speaking apart from the crowd.
 Jim is in the background studying a painting, wearing a trench coat with the hood up some dark sunglasses and a set of Groucho Marx glasses, facing away from Liz and her mother.
 Cleo is smoking, from time to time she lights up a new one.

 “Well, well, what do we have here?

 Her eyes fluttered shut, but his lips had barely touched hers when she pulled back.
 "Rick--" "Marie."
 He brushed his lips over hers and nuzzled her cheek before burying his face in her neck.

“If he can even understand us,” said another.
 “We understand perfectly,” Qurrah said, stepping to one side.
 “What has my brother done to warrant your attention?”

 He took her hand and raised her arm so that he could kiss it where he'd squeezed it.
 "Better?"
 "Yes," she breathed.
 He'd never kissed her arm before.
 When he was gone, she dropped onto her bed with a smile.
 But it slowly became a frown.
 She was beginning to think she didn't understand her betrothed at all.
 She'd never seen him get angry before he’d proposed.
 And she'd thought that being betrothed would mean they'd spend more time together, but they were actually spending less time together.

 Sometimes overcooking leads to worse performances.

You didn't hang around the fringe without running into plenty of people who were conspiracy theorists.
 Discussing UFOs, Illuminati, and X-Files had been like air and water for some of the people I'd known back in Minneapolis.
 I'd never given their wild theories a second thought before, but what Britney was describing sounded like a pretty convincing attempt at a cover-up.
 I looked up as I realized Britney had fallen silent, only to realize with a start that a pair of tears were trickling down her face.
 "Mark and Lessi were the only ones to really open up when I moved in.
 Their great-grandparents were some of the first people to settle down here.
 They used to tell me all kinds of crazy stories.
 After they were killed nobody would really talk to me.
 Everyone was polite, but it was like I was shut out, like they blamed me for what happened."
 Britney paused for a second and then shuddered.

She looked at me as she slowly pulled her sweat pants off exposing a stunning young body and sleek thong underwear.
 She tugged slightly at her thong to adjust it as she looked over her shoulder in the mirror and checked herself out.
 She then sat back on top of me while she continued to talk to me and I watched her in the mirror as she pulled her top off exposing her bare breasts.
 I kept watching her in the mirror and she was watching me.
 It got quiet and I needed an ice breaker for the silence so I quipped that she certainly didn’t dress like a cop and she laughed.
 She bent at the waist as she put her hands to the side of my shoulders and she pressed her bare breasts against my back.
 She rubbed her breasts on my back and buttocks as she maneuvered her body over mine.
 I couldn’t help but be aroused.
 She leaned in close to my ear with her mouth, her young body firmly against my back, and then asked me seductively if I would sell her the Oxy.
 I told her I would find out how many I had and we could probably work something out and sell them to her.

 Normally I would have just acquiesced, but I couldn't bear the thought of letting him leave, taking with him the identity of the only person besides my mom who really cared what happened to me.
 I tightened my grip in an attempt to stop him.
 "Please, if you won't tell me who it is, let me write a thank you note.

 He stopped partway through shaking his head.
 "I can't promise he'll even bother to read it, but I'll take it to him if you promise never to talk about this again.

Something to eat perhaps?
 Or if you'd rather, I can show you to the theater."

 Of course Alec had a theater in his house.
 Probably a pool and a gym too.
 Along with a half-dozen other amenities I'd never think of, but that the ultra-rich simply couldn't do without.
 I pulled my erratic, pointless thoughts back into a compact, nearly sensible ball, and shook my head as I did my best to give him a genuine smile.
 "No thanks.
 I probably won't be hungry for several hours still.
 Is there a library in the house perhaps?"

 Ruby laughed.
 “Ah, well, I suppose just this once.” Grey sat, rough brown boots resting among the stone, and she leaned over him as if for a kiss.
 Her lips stopped just short of his, their eyes connecting as a glint of firelight caught the shimmer and Grey breathed it in.
 As she pulled away, his fingers trailed slowly off her arm and I felt I was intruding, so I averted my eyes.

His eyes searched for anything that could grant him cover.
 The forest was too far, and all about was shin-high grass.
 “No choice,” he gasped.
 His entire right half of his body ached.
 “Celestia, grant me mercy.
 I cannot go further.”
 He stumbled to the ground.
 His face and armor were camouflaged with greens and browns, but just grass would make it difficult to go unnoticed.
 Still, he had no choice but to try.
 He tucked his bow beneath him and then smashed his face into the dirt while sprinkling grass atop his head.

 We were both sold, but I escaped.

 The officers are sent to stake out a nearby drugstore.
 My story to the drug dealers will be that I will fill the prescription there and meet her in that parking lot as it is a stone’s throw within the county line which they want the bust in.
 One problem I point out is that the drugstore will be closed in a few minutes but they send the crew that direction for feedback on the location.
 The call comes back and the parking lot is virtually empty of cars leaving no cover for the officers to hide.

The march of humanity is marked by the development of larger-scale, more complex and more efficient types of organizations to serve higher and wider social needs.
 Advances in the technology of organization, as much as advances in the technology of production, have been responsible for global progress during the present century and, especially, during the post-war period.
 We have argued earlier that establishment of effective and lasting peace requires a radical restructuring of the existing institutions for global governance.
 Unless and until the UN comes to embody in its own functioning the principles of representative democracy, it cannot hope to play a leading role in maintaining peace and freedom in the world.
 As government and political leaders know only too well, an organization with responsibility but without authority is doomed to failure.
 Unless UN member states invest international institutions with the necessary authority and meet their financial commitments to support them, the world will continue to drift and flounder, powerless to oppose petty dictators and ruthless aggression.
 Unless a cooperative world military force comes into existence, every country will continue to be burdened with the enormous expense and insecurity characteristic of the old system.
 Perhaps more than any other institution, the military has under stood and demonstrated the enormous power of organization to accomplish a goal.
 The Gulf War was a dramatic illustration of the importance of reliable information, perfect planning, logistical support systems, effective chains of command and swift responsiveness to changing situations.
 If humankind could mobilize and apply the same efficiency to the war on poverty and unemployment that it has exhibited in preparing for and waging military wars against each other, very soon there would be no more poverty or unemployment to fight.

 next century's politics and on the UN is also doomed to failure, fall victim to corruption, or fail to augment the forces of democracy. She must nurture the world in a revolutionary dynamic that fuels humanity in understanding its divine responsibility to humankind. As she serves, it is crucial to resolve

Karen – You claim that you’re not an art fan.
 You don’t work for Miss Struan, and you’re not a family member.

 And you seem to know a lot about Elizabeth and her artwork.

I didn't recognize the vehicle, which was a bad sign.
 It was a light-eating black, and emitted the throaty roar of a sports car.

 That really seemed like the best course.
 Maybe if I pretended he wasn't there, the driver would just go away.

Everyone got to dress up and go dancing in a place that'd been transformed into another world.
 Even before I'd gotten old enough to attend Prom, I'd still invariably spent the day grouchy and depressed.
 Things only got worse as I'd aged, presumably because I wasn't really as indifferent as I liked to pretend, and I couldn't hide behind the excuse of being too young to be asked anymore.
 My pulse had already skyrocketed; I almost didn't hear what Rachel was saying over the pounding in my ears.
 "...of course it's still a little ways away, but a girl like Britney starts early so she gets as high up the social food chain as possible."
 Rachel's words calmed me a little at the same time they sparked confusion.
 I'd never heard her be quite so cynical.
 It was completely at odds with the innocent, accepting exterior she usually displayed.

What did Dylan say?
 “Something’s going on here but you don’t know what it is.”  That’s it, man.
 When he plugged in he changed music, but he can’t plug in again, you know?
 And he went backwards after that, because he’s the jester, man, and by going backwards, like Merlin, he was going forward.
 Dylan’s always been a bellwether, though he hates that thought.
 I don’t want to be anyone’s bellwether, either.
 Bob told me once, he said, “You never play your old stuff.
 Man, I wish I could get away with that.”  See, he’s sick of “Like a Rolling Stone.”  He’s trapped, he feels trapped.

The tree soared above them so high that Rodregas thought it must be far higher than the Cathedral itself.
 This was, of course, impossible.
 As Rodregas stopped beside Imeralda he tried to see the shape of the leaf to identify the type of tree, but the leaves were so high up he could only see a very general shape.
 The shape of the trunk reminded him of a white oak, but the color was a darker gray with touches of striped brown.
 The trunk was huge, thicker than the towers of the keep.
 But that made no sense to Rodregas.
 The chamber seemed to be the same size as the one they had entered and if one of the great towers had been in the middle there would be hardly room to fit it, and yet the trunk was not that close to them from the door and was not near any of the walls.
 So it was either smaller around, which was impossible because of the height, or the chamber must be far smaller.
 Rodregas shook his head in confusion.
 “What is that?” asked Doi’van.

It would've been worse if Mom was around constantly making comparisons between what she was doing and what Dad would've done.
 "...so this is the only day he can help me, and if I don't get some help climbing, then I'll never make it high enough to get the shot for the tourism booklet.
 You understand, don't you, sweetie?"
 I nodded, and managed a fairly convincing smile.
 "Okay, then.
 Well there's a present for you in the living room, but since you didn't want to celebrate until after school, you'll have to wait to open it."
 I could definitely hear the rumble of a high-performance engine.
 I nodded again, and turned to go, hopeful that I could avoid the inevitable question of why Brandon was coming to pick me up in the mornings as well as dropping me off most afternoons.
 Unfortunately, Mom's hearing was nearly as good as mine, and she was walking towards the windows before I managed to get the door open.

He was built like the elves, strong and muscled, but still lean.
 He wore plain pants and tall boots.
 His light cloth shirt moved around him as he walked, unlaced at the chest.
 He carried a small blade in his hand, but I couldn’t imagine what he was doing here unaccompanied.
 There was a rustle from the brush several yards in the opposite direction I was hiding.
 He rushed toward it and I followed, unsure why he was running.
 The noise was made by a small boar and the human was chasing it.
 He ran after it, gasping for air, and I followed close behind, thrilling at the spectacle.
 The boar approached a ridge of rock and turned, giving the human the advantage.
 He leaped after it, blade held wide, and landed, slicing into its side and twisting the blade back out.

As they approached Chevelle cautiously, I examined their insignia.
 Even if they weren’t from the village, I still needed council members to unbind me, and I had a sudden urge to go to them.
 But I remembered my warning to be still.
 “She’s not going back.” Chevelle’s tone, level and uncompromising, caught my attention.
 I pushed the hood back to better hear and the taller figure glared at me as he hissed, “You’re protecting her when you know what she’s capable of?” I flinched at his words, but something else had caught my eye.
 The robes were ornate, the tassels interwoven with color.
 He was Grand Council.
 I studied the other newcomer, who acted as if I wasn’t present.
 He was incredulous, staring at Chevelle when he spoke.

 “No.
 No council.” He paused while he formed the rest of his reply.

Prom night, for reasons more complicated than I can remember so long, Cliff was driving a '49 Ford convertible that belonged to Bob Williams, whom I will visit in Portland a few days from now.
 Cliff's date was Chris Latin.
 Karen and I rode in the back seat.
 Karen had a cold.
 Maybe her reason for keeping her distance, physical and otherwise, was hygienic concern for my health.
 Or maybe she didn't approve of my dating Liz.
 Whatever the truth, she wounded my already tenderized feelings.
 For a while during the after-prom at a bowling alley, I left her and found Margaret.
 We hid under a pool table and talked about Eric and our dubious futures.

If I didn't return with a box soon Mom would rush out expecting the worst.
 Unless she got caught up visualizing some new project, in which case it would be hours before she thought to come check on me.
 We'd moved the beds and most of the other heavy items in earlier, which helped explain my exhaustion, but that didn't make the pile of remaining items in the back of the truck any less foreboding.
 I decided to take the easy way out, and picked up a couple of blanket-wrapped mirrors.
 I didn't unwrap either of them.
 That was dangerous too.
 The face that'd look back out of the glass would look almost more like hers than mine.
 Shoulder-length blond hair and blue eyes still seemed to be all the rage, but mine were ruined by pale skin that burned instead of tanning, and a build that had retained its baby fat long after most of the other girls had started slimming down.
 Those extra inches had evaporated recently, but of course it couldn't be a cause for celebration.
 When Mom surfaced enough to notice how much weight I'd lost, she worried I was developing an eating disorder.

"You need to get some sleep.
 Regardless of how the fight turns out, you'll need to be well-rested."
 My best longing look didn't seem to be having any effect on him, so I finally nodded and relaxed back onto the bed.
 "I guess I did promise to behave myself.
 I don't think I'll be able to sleep, but if you'll tell me another story I'll at least try..." Apparently satisfied by my promise, Alec joined me on the bed and pulled me close.
 I was still chilled enough from being outside for the warmth of his arms to feel good.
 "Adjam and Inock found that the dayborn had lost all knowledge of their loving mother, and that they reacted poorly to Inock's plague form.
 Neither brother was able to maintain their original forms for more than a few hours at a time, and although Adjam was able to blend in with the animals found in the area, there was nothing like Inock's feline body nearby, and he was chased and hunted by many of the dayborn, for they thought him a demon."
 Alec's breath caressed the back of my neck even as his quiet, velvety baritone reached inside my head and smoothed away the tensions that'd been keeping me from seeking sleep.
 I knew there'd been a reason for being so scared, but I just couldn't bring myself to care about it now.

The overall proportion of the population employed in the European Community has declined by 1 per cent since 1965 and is presently just under 41 per cent, but the percentage of the working age population employed has remained more or less constant over the past three decades, at 67 per cent, whereas in other OECD regions it has risen significantly – to exceed 75 per cent in North America, Scandinavia and Japan.
 Europe’s lower labour participation rate is attributable to a number of factors.
 A far higher percentage of the European workforce was engaged in agriculture 25 years ago and has since shifted to non-agricultural sectors, an adjustment that occurred in the United States during earlier decades.
 During the 1980s Europe chose a high-wage path to growth, passing on the benefits to the existing workforce but creating relatively few new jobs; whereas the United States, with a similar economic growth rate over the decade, showed lower income growth per worker, but a steadily rising employment rate.
 Europe is now confronted with the need for structural adjustment to compensate.
 In the United States, the extent of the unemployment problem is partially disguised in the form of low-wage jobs, which distribute total income over a larger number of workers.
 Twenty per cent of all full-time US workers have incomes that fall below the official poverty line for a family of four, though only a quarter of these live in households whose total income is below the poverty line.
 Real wages in the United States have not risen significantly over the last 20 years due to the dramatic increase in the supply of labour as a result of a 62 per cent increase in female participation since 1960 and the entrance of the baby-boom generation into the workforce.
 However, America’s ‘family living standard’ has still risen by 40 per cent since 1970.
 Within the next decade, the aging of the population is expected to reduce job pressures and even lead to labour shortages in some European countries.

6.Government regulation is essential for a free market: A free market does not mean an unregulated one.
 Quite understandably, decades of totalitarian government had generated such powerful resentment against strong government that by way of re action the society sought for solutions which did not require government to take a highly visible, leading role.
 The reform programme was based on the implicit assumption that the market is a self-regulating mechanism which can substitute for regulation by government.
 This notion is contradicted by the experience and practice of every major market economy in the world.
 Government plays a critically important role in defining and protecting property rights, ensuring competitive conditions, controlling monopolies, regulating foreign trade, establishing and enforcing quality standards, safeguarding the rights of investors and consumers, preserving the environment from over-exploitation and pollution, encouraging investment, and upholding the rights of employees to minimum wages, safe working conditions and social security in the case of lay-offs.
 The policies that have made possible the most successful recent development initiatives of nations around the world, especially in Japan and the newly industrialized nations of the Pacific Rim, do not support the argument for unregulated free market forces.
 These countries combined freedom for entrepreneurial initiative, private property and market prices with care fully crafted industrial policies and tightly controlled foreign trade and investment practices to nurture and protect nascent industries and restrict foreign investment.
 At the same time, they organized the importation of foreign technology on a massive scale.
 They utilized import tariffs, export incentives, tax relief and other mechanisms to guide development of their domestic economies.
 The reform programme involved the dismantling of most of the administrative mechanisms by which an economy can be monitored and controlled by government.

Coping with such rapid change has not been easy.
 It has brought in its wake a broad array of problems – a widening gap between the most advanced and least developed sections both within and between nations, a disequilibrium between growth of population and economic growth, rising unemployment, alienated youth, increasing violence and crime, depletion of natural resources, degradation of the environment, overcrowded cities, mass migrations of talent from South to North, displacement of millions of political and economic refugees, the breakdown of the family and the erosion of traditional social institutions.
 Although much has been learned about the various stages of social and economic development, much less is known about the actual process itself by which societies transit from one stage or level or form to another.
 As a result, our efforts to speed the transition are often haphazard, stumbling and fraught with difficulty.
 Today former colonial nations such as Vietnam and Zimbabwe strive to catch up with countries that have never been subject to foreign rule.
 The tribal nations of central Africa struggle at great cost to transform themselves into modern states.
 Even within the prosperous West, the speed and extent of progress is uneven, leading to the emergence of ‘developing countries’ within developed nations, of poverty-stricken families in inner cities with rates of chronic unemployment as high as 50 per cent or more.
 Nothing is of greater value to humanity’s quest for progress than an understanding of the development process and the means for consciously directing it more effectively.
 The tremendous economic achievements of Japan during the post-war period, followed during the last two decades by other East Asian economic powers and most recently by China, suggest that the time required for transition can be substantially abridged and the fruits of development achieved much sooner than has been accomplished by nations in the past.
 The rising expectations of people around the globe and the potential risks of failing to heed their call have added a greater sense of urgency to the quest for this knowledge.

 The whole time they had taught she had found her mind wandering to the sick, spidery voice Qurrah spoke in, a voice that had nearly spoiled his otherwise surprising charm.

“You're leaving us?
 You little...” “Seth!” I protested and stepped in front of him.
 “Don't you dare think about killing him.
 He got us here-” “And he's leaving us here in some random place when we have no clue what to do or where we're going,” Seth interrupted me.
 The dwarf shook his head.
 “I'm very sorry, sir, but her majesty told me to bring you here and then to report back.
 I must tell her about the ambush, someone knew I was bringing you here.” “Don't you have to bring us to her?” Seth asked.
 The dwarf cocked his head.
 “No, she will see you when she believes you are ready,” He turned around and disappeared into the woods.
 “Wait!” I yelled and ran after him.

He looked his giant warrior up and down.
 “You are wounded.
 Is it serious?”
 “Bah, I can handle far more than this,” Harruq said.
 “I’ll bandage them when we get home.”
 “Very well.

 Your work is done this night.”
 Lying in the grass next to Velixar was the dead body of an elf male.
 Qurrah glanced at it, and then looked to his master.

While he was not as attracted as he had felt with the Celestial Lion, he guessed that this was as good a match as he would find among the Infernal Daemons.
 Rodregas looked back toward Doi’van, but could no longer see him.
 He knew he should check on him and Imeralda, but he also knew that they had all chosen to walk this path.
 It had ended up being a more interesting path than expected, but they all wanted to see where it went.
 He reached up and petted the powerful black head of the creature.
 Its ears had the only hint of non-black on the beast, a slight touch of silver.
 The fur was not as soft as it looked and was actually rough to the touch.
 Rodregas realized his hand was sinking into the skin.
 He tried to pull back but felt himself being drawn into it.
 He was being pulled physically into the panther.

Real wages in the United States have not risen significantly over the last 20 years due to the dramatic increase in the supply of labour as a result of a 62 per cent increase in female participation since 1960 and the entrance of the baby-boom generation into the workforce.
 However, America’s ‘family living standard’ has still risen by 40 per cent since 1970.
 Within the next decade, the aging of the population is expected to reduce job pressures and even lead to labour shortages in some European countries.
 Job growth has been quite rapid in the developing countries over the last forty years, more than doubling total employment.
 The single most important factor behind rising numbers of unemployed persons and increasing absolute numbers of families below the poverty line in developing countries has been the 2.4-fold expansion of population in the Third World, and more than doubling of the economically active population since 1950, which have resulted in a 4 per cent decline in the overall employment rate.
 Population growth rates continue to fall steadily in most countries, with the exception of Africa, providing an opportu nity for economic growth and job growth to catch up with the population explosion of recent decades.
 Along with rapid quantitative job growth, the global economy has achieved dramatic qualitative gains in the nature of employment.
 During recent decades, there has also been a marked movement away from subsistence level manual occupations, primarily in agriculture, to more skilled and remunerative forms of employment.
 Worldwide, the percentage of the work force engaged in agriculture has fallen by 24 per cent since 1950, from 67 to 51 per cent.
 Unemployment is of growing concern today primarily because population has expanded in recent decades even faster than job creation and because a larger percentage of the population, principally women, seek employment now than at any time in the past.

 .8% unemployment at factory level ended in 1996 against the 1990 equivalent rate. Whereas Germany has reached 1985 in 1996, after which it grows more substantially than in 1985 83.38% of the workforce has sought employment, especially in the strong producing cities. 2 percent unemployment in 8 of 20 states, 1990

The water started to chill several times, but I was hesitant to get out.
 At the risk of boiling myself, I eased the magic I’d been using to reheat the bath.
 Finally, I felt well enough to stand.
 I picked up one of the soaps and washed quickly, then pulled the water from the tub to rinse the suds away.
 I’d not had much opportunity to practice with water; I added it to the list of things to work on.
 It had been a long journey, and the bath was refreshing.
 The soap left a light fragrance in the air, smelling like morning and cold, and I wondered if the fairy dust was still affecting me.
 I dried off and dressed in the clothes Ruby had put out for me.
 They were a little snug, but not enough to have been her castoffs.
 The room had its own full-length mirror and I giggled at my reflection.

 Shit. Check. Nothing happened. I counted three and then I peered over a table where silver bows still remained strewn about. It looked like a tank top, a shadow reminiscent of her favorite brand jeans. I bent down to the table and slipped out of my thigh-high rubber boots

A snicker slipped from Steed and Anvil glanced at him before amending, “Well, that is where they cut out part of my tongue.” I recoiled, wrenching my hand from his.
 The tingle remained.
 He didn’t seem offended; he simply took a few steps backward to start his demonstration.
 I brought my arm back to my side and it brushed Ruby, shocking her just enough to make both of us flinch.
 She only smiled as she returned her attention to the start of the show.
 The other men drew back, some sitting, some standing, but all giving him their full attention and space as he raised his hands and braced himself, taking one full deep breath before shifting forward, ever so slightly.
 A thunderous crack and excruciating light flew from both of his outstretched hands, slammed into a tall pine, and snapped the top third of the tree off.

Violent local conflicts continue to flare around the world.
 Terrorist acts have intensified against civilian populations on every continent.
 While the worst fears about rising unemployment in the West have been dispelled, the challenge of generating sufficient employment opportunities for all people around the world remains a pressing concern.
 The rich-poor divide has increased within and between nations.
 Inadequate job/livelihood opportunities resulting in inadequate purchasing power have now become the most important cause of endemic and hidden hunger.
 Most regrettable has been the failure to enhance the powers and strengthen reliance on effective multilateral institutions.
 The emergence of the USA as the sole superpower has brought with it a reduction in the role and influence of the UN in international affairs, precisely at a time when the world should be striving to build a viable multilateral cooperative security system.
 The Unfinished Agenda
 The Commission’s report was never intended to predict what would happen in the years to come, but rather to project what could be made to happen by a concerted, determined effort of the world community.
 The report highlighted many of the opportunities that did emerge as well as some of the dangers that have grown in intensity in the absence of effective action.

Restructuring the UN
 The movement towards democracy is not merely a question of idealism.
 In some countries, particularly in Africa, it is an essential step towards over coming the desperate economic conditions that threaten the lives of millions of people.
 In many others, it can vastly accelerate the development process by releasing greater social initiative.
 In his message to the ICPF quoted earlier, the UN Secretary General emphasized the importance of democratization – what he chose to call political development – as an essential foundation and complement to peace, and to both economic and social development.
 There have been cases where development was accompanied by an authoritarian political system.
 But, we have invariably seen that if the participation in the market place is not accompanied by political participation, development efforts are brought to naught by social and political instability.... Once again, therefore, we see the inescapable relations governing the goals of peace, development and democratization – these are the goals of the United Nations.
 In order for this revolution to have its full beneficial impact on the world’s political and economic affairs, its principles need to be extended to cover all nations and international institutions.
 The end of the confrontation between democratic and autocratic superpowers within the UN system opens up the possibility of finally translating the idealistic aims of the UN into practical realities.
 First and foremost is the prospect of extending representative government to all nations.

 countries have increased interest in democracy. These and other demands for a deeper commitment to publicly espouse democracy and bring about genuine desired results, such as social growth, economic development, poverty reduction, and social stability are undoubtedly welcome among today’s neighbors At New York’s graduation it is not just a decision

He looked around the dimly lit cavern and spotted Jazell, sprawled out on the floor.
 He crawled over to her.

 The water will actually emit quite a bit of ultraviolet light, but for whatever reasons, the electrons don't ever seem to release any electromagnetic radiation down in the lower energy levels like infrared, or even the visible red.

As Rodregas walked up to the watchtower gates he once again wore the sorcerer’s robe that Captain Poir had fetched for him, but this time he wore it outside of his armor.
 He climbed the inner stairs until he stepped into the watchtower room at the top.
 He played it bold, walked up to the staring guard and signaled him to turn around.
 Then Rodregas proceeded to gag and bind him.
 The confused guard did not even struggle.
 Next, Rodregas went to the front gate and repeated his actions with the lone guard at the gate; he then picked him up and took him to sit with his friend at the top of the gate.
 He made sure both were securely tied up and blindfolded and took off their weapon harnesses and kept them; their two short swords were nicer than the ones that he had taken from the armory.
 Both men also had purses with them that jingled with their bonus money in a promising way.
 He then headed back to the dungeon, stopping at the chicken coop to let out the chickens.
 They quickly spread all over the yard.

More often than before, I noticed hummingbirds, horizons, occotillos.
 Spring was the most glorious in years.
 I was feeling more all the time.
 In 1945, the year I was born, my grandma, Mary Durham Garfield, wrote this poem:
 LIVING MONUMENTS Far rather would I pass away And leave a noble son of mine Whom I had taught to love the fine, The just and honest, in his day To serve the world with courage bold, Than have my life on granite told.
 I’d rather feel when death is near That in my children I shall live.
 No monument of stone can give Me greater glory, year by year, Than sons and daughters going on In truth and honor, when I’m gone.
 Who leaves a noble son on earth, A noble daughter, sweet and pure, Has monuments that long endure.
 No shaft can give her greater worth.
 The luster of her children’s deeds Is all the monument she needs.

There was even the expected contingent of jocks, obviously there just because a coach or parent had delivered some kind of ultimatum.
 Britney predictably headed over and staked out a table as close as she could get to a group of girls who were probably cheerleaders.
 Clustered around the other end of the room were the more studious kids, the kind who were generally pretty smart, but for whatever reason were struggling with math.
 I wasn't surprised to see a kind of a no-man's-land between the two ends of the spectrum.
 I was startled to see that the middle ground was inhabited by an attractive girl a year or two younger than me.
 Left to my own devices, I would've normally picked a table over on the nerd end of the room, but I found myself relating more to the girl stuck in the middle.
 She looked up and met my gaze for just a second before ducking back down and concentrating on her homework.
 Shy, obviously, and not popular.
 There'd been the hint of a smile on her face, possibly constrained by fear of how her overture might be received.
 Obviously a complete social reject just like me.

I will expect no one to know that we head for the Northern Coast.” Audrian looked like he was going to say something.
 Rodregas thought the loss of the Hellborn did not bother him, but the beautiful half AElfin maiden was another matter.
 However, her point about how she put them in danger clearly made him hesitate.
 Rodregas just headed for the wagon and got it going.
 With a last confused look from Rodregas, Audrian and the other two headed back towards the nearest town.
 The three talked little as they traveled.
 Rodregas set a hard pace and Imeralda sat in the back of the wagon.
 Doi’van weighed too much to ride in the overburdened wagon or to ride the horse, so he jogged next to the wagon.
 He had impressive endurance.

Only very sick, masochistic people buy calendars with this kind of crap on it.
 Sane people take pictures of furry little animals romping around green landscapes and sell those.
 That helped a little, my breathing was starting to slow back down, but that was too related to the other reasons we'd moved.
 I wasn't mentally back in safe territory still.
 I sought refuge in something even more mundane.
 Namely the fact that tomorrow I would have to go enroll in school and try to blend in with a bunch of small-town juniors who'd all probably known each other since they could walk.
 Going to a new school after missing the first month of classes was a prospect likely to generate anxiety in the most outgoing of teenagers, and I was far from that, but it was a different kind of worry.
 As I mapped out all of the things that could, and probably would, go wrong, I could feel my heart slowly settle back down out of my throat.
 If I were pretty or athletic I'd probably manage to fit right in.
 It always seemed like the kids who moved in partway through the year usually had some kind of instant in with the cool crowd, but that probably wouldn't happen for me.

Armani, Versace, Prada, we conducted a tour de force of them all along with others whose names I didn't even recognize.
 The shopping trip was ostensibly for me, but Rachel cajoled both Jasmin and Dominic into dressing rooms on more than one occasion.
 Amazingly enough, everything she picked out for them fit so perfectly that I began to agree with them that there wasn't much point in even trying anything on.
 The first store we stopped at didn't take us seriously until Rachel pulled out a black American Express, after which every sales person in the entire place lined up to assist us.
 Once we each sported a bag or two from some ridiculously over-priced store, things went much more smoothly.
 I tried on a variety of jeans, blouses, shirts, skirts, dresses, and just about every other article of clothing imaginable.
 I drew the line at a swimsuit, since there was no way on earth I'd ever wear one, and then felt so bad at how crushed Rachel was that I let her drag me into a store full of formals.
 It was a mistake because I soon found myself being zipped into a delicate, green dress that I was absolutely positive wasn't going to survive the experience of trying to wrap itself around me.

The moment I entered the castle, I knew something was wrong.
 I had gone in through the servants’ quarters, desiring to keep a low profile.
 When they saw me, fear crossed their faces and they disappeared from sight.

 I wondered if something had gone wrong with Rune’s spell this time.

“You share a minor sigil very freely for being in the great Cathedral itself,” her voice was but a whisper, her eyes more curious then challenging.
 “They would likely die without our aid,” said Imeralda.
 Doi’van nodded next to her.
 Rodregas thought that Doi’van was strangely silent.
 He guessed that the Hellborn was afraid to speak, even in a whisper.
 His voice was like granite breaking and traveled.
 “So you risk your life to save strangers?” the female squire asked.
 Her voice actually sounded curious.

I was told to call her from my phone and tell her I would call her tomorrow around noon.
 Chapter 18: Game Time I arrived at the station and was escorted to an interrogation room.
 It looked like a carbon copy of the room I was in before but it was further down the hall.
 Officer White connected a recording device to my crack-berry and I was told to place the call and get Ashley to engage in conversation that would be incriminating.
 I was to get her to use the word “Oxy” and discuss the price and the quantity and to get Ashley to acknowledge that the price was “$2500 cash for the one hundred Oxys.” I placed the call, nervous and anxious to be sure to get what the police wanted.
 To my shock, the recording on Ashley’s phone stated it was no longer in service.
 The officer was obviously disappointed and suggested that perhaps they caught on to the scheme, as they were very savvy.

A day since Kojas took him.
 I had told him, when he had first said that Kojas wanted to use him that he didn’t have to worry.
 I should have known that Kojas would do anything to get him, and now Seth was gone.
 After he had been taken and Jason had awakened, the faery jerks had scattered.
 Then a light pixie had showed up, the same one who had saved my life a while ago, and led us all the way to her majesty’s place.
 She was apparently the queen but she was nothing like a stuck up royal leader.
 She was more like a warrior who lead Igneeria in the ‘good times.’ She was really nice but when we had met her, I was in an awful mood.
 No one blamed me; I had just watched one of my best friends get beat up and taken right before my eyes.

Brandon was mistaken thinking that he was smarter than everyone else because while he was the dealer, other people—addicts—hung on his every word as though he was speaking gospel.
 The person dishing out the drugs rambles stupidly and thinks his admirers should be carving his wise words in a stone tablet.
 Been there, seen that with Thomas and others!
 We had been giving him regular drug tests, which showed levels of positive, and that line had been starting to drop.
 It seemed to be leaving his system— it took a while to be completely clean.
 But at some point during the intervention, in between the crying and the lying, it occurred to me that this boy didn’t look like he was suffering the effects of withdrawals.
 His symptoms seemed to be suddenly better and his detox wasn’t as severe as we thought it would be or as bad as it had been the first time years before.
 And I cocked my head and listened more carefully to his lies— the lies which I suddenly realized were consistent with his past behavior when he was high.
 Stop the presses!
 I sprung up and shook my finger in the air in front of his face.

 Shock crossed her face and I hoped it would buy the time I needed.

 The cold water had thrown her for no more than a fraction of a second, but it was enough time to right myself and execute one quick attack.
 I volleyed a nearby rock, which struck her in the back of the head and threw her balance off for another instant.
 I knew I was larger than her so I gritted my teeth and lunged, grabbing her as I tried to figure my next move.

I dropped my bag and leaned my back against the statue, closing my eyes.
 I wondered what Igneeria would be like.
 Maybe the place would be pretty decent… “Jazell?” Emily’s voice scattered my thoughts and I opened my eyes to see her walking briskly towards me.
 She too had an empty bag slung over her shoulder.
 She dropped her bag next to mine and leaned against the statue.
 Nobody spoke for awhile.
 Finally Emily opened her mouth and said, “What are you thinking about?” “What?” The question had caught me by complete surprise.
 “What are you thinking about?” she repeated.
 “Surely you must be thinking something; we’re going to some ‘other world’!” I closed my eyes.

I was joyless—I was beyond joy.
 I think I presented them with a real interesting case, you know?
 I mean, one of the doctor’s I know, a young guy, a pretty hip cat, he knew my stuff.
 He wanted to talk about the music, nothing but the music.
 I mean, he was disguising it as a mental exam, but it was mostly curiosity, you know, I was the closest thing to a celebrity he’d ever treated.
 We talked about The Highsteppers, Sam the Sham, I mean, he knew them all, all the old blues guys even.
 He wanted stories.
 I don’t think he was speeding my recovery.

Rapid progress in the application of science and technology in agriculture, industry, and human health strengthened the hope that the concept of 'food, education, health and employment for all' can be converted from rhetoric into reality, provided the peace dividend can be deployed to achieve these goals.
 ICPF had the advantage of building on the work of earlier independent commissions, particularly those chaired by Willy Brandt, Gro Harlem Brundtland and Julius Nyerere.
 We began our work with the conviction that, as Willy Brandt said, 'the problems created by men can be solved by men'.
 The ancient Indian scripture, Bhagavad Gita, expressed the same sentiment by stressing, 'Whatever man aspires to, that he can accomplish.'
 The achievement of food self-sufficiency by India in a period when famine threatened millions of lives through the power of political will and scientific action in a democratic society illustrates this truth.
 In spite of such uncommon opportunities for a better common present, during the last six years the world has been witness to an escalation of ethnic and mini-conflicts, growing intolerance of diversity, the spread of small arms, an increase in violence starting with violence to oneself through drug addiction and damage to the life support systems of land, water, flora, fauna and the atmosphere.
 In addition, the current pattern of economic and technological growth is leading to gross social inequity and rising joblessness.
 The rich-poor divide is widening both within and among nations.
 At the same time, the spread of knowledge and information, particularly through the electronic media, has led to an era of rising expectations.
 The economically and socially underprivileged sections of human society are now aware that their future is not a question of fate, but of political and technological choice.

Therefore, review of the present should not be so difficult, whether by "passing new legislation with new machinery, intelligent means of integrating such organs and lim

“The elders are in an uproar.” I didn’t question any further.
 Town trouble was usually of no interest to me.
 Actually, I couldn’t think of the last time the town had had trouble… She huffed and I knew it was best to indulge her.
 “What sort of trouble?” “Apparently, Evelyn of Rothegarr came into town from the meadows at full speed wheezing and sneezing.
 She reached the village center, grabbed her throat, and fell to the ground without a breath.

 Fannie continued, “They found a common thistle caught in her airway.” My stomach curled into knots.
 I whispered, “A thistle?” “Mmm.

 She threw the cork at me.

 While working at Coffee Dan's, on breaks Cliff and I consorted with the waitresses.
 Reba, a truck stop veteran, had eyes for Cliff, though she was twice his age.
 She was toying with his hair when sweet Helga came in and gasped.
 She fetched a Bible from her cubby and read aloud, “Her lips drip honey, but in the end she is a bitter fruit.
 Her steps lead straight to the grave.” Reba laughed and sat in the chair between Cliff and me.
 She arched her back so her breasts swelled.
 “Helga, last night I took your advice.

I sought refuge in something even more mundane.
 Namely the fact that tomorrow I would have to go enroll in school and try to blend in with a bunch of small-town juniors who'd all probably known each other since they could walk.
 Going to a new school after missing the first month of classes was a prospect likely to generate anxiety in the most outgoing of teenagers, and I was far from that, but it was a different kind of worry.
 As I mapped out all of the things that could, and probably would, go wrong, I could feel my heart slowly settle back down out of my throat.
 If I were pretty or athletic I'd probably manage to fit right in.
 It always seemed like the kids who moved in partway through the year usually had some kind of instant in with the cool crowd, but that probably wouldn't happen for me.
 It wasn't that I didn't want to make friends; I just wasn't very good at it.
 My equilibrium seemed to have returned, so I took a few unsteady steps around to the back of the truck.
 If I didn't return with a box soon Mom would rush out expecting the worst.
 Unless she got caught up visualizing some new project, in which case it would be hours before she thought to come check on me.

 For Rick, it was almost like watching TV with a child: Marie had questions about everything.
 It was fun to watch the wonder on her face and the avid attention she gave the programs.

Harruq continuously glanced over at Qurrah, and when the frailer half-orc was overtaken by a coughing fit, Harruq was there, pounding his brother’s back and looking like his world was about to end.
 Qurrah merely looked embarrassed and pushed him away.
 _They clearly love each other,_ thought Aurelia.
 _Maybe Harruq more than Qurrah._
 The day passed, and it was thankfully uneventful.
 She was almost ready to leave when Qurrah pulled Harruq closer and began whispering.
 Aurelia cast a spell over her ears, heightening her already sharp hearing.
 A pall settled over her as she listened.

I saw nothing happen but knew there must be something, some unseen force causing them pain, draining them.
 I couldn’t look away but stammered to Ruby, “What’s happening?” “They are trying to overpower one another.” I could hear the pleasure in her voice.

It was a rather depressing exercise.
 By the time Mrs. Sorenson had fired a couple of ridiculously obscure questions at me, I found the good feelings I'd managed to carry away from the mayor's visit the night before had pretty much evaporated.
 English should have been better.
 Wuthering Heights wasn't ever going to be my favorite book, but Mr. Whethers had made the characters more real in the last few days and I was actually excited to see what he had in store next.
 Unfortunately, Mr. Whethers wasn't there.
 The substitute teacher sitting at his desk didn't even take roll; he just shut the door, told us to keep it down, and flipped open a magazine.
 While I was sitting at my desk wondering what to do with the next hour of my life, something I'd read in the physics book suddenly clicked.

It is ironic that advice coming from overseas almost invariably recommended eliminating sup ports to this critical sector of the economy.
 In the midst of radical economic revolution, the economy, especially the agricultural economy, is in no position to adapt simultaneously to the dual stresses of internal reorganization and external competition.
 8.New institutions and systems are needed to create a market economy: The establishment of a free market system is retarded by the absence of many basic commercial institutions and systems.
 The market economy has given birth to a vast array of institutions by which, and through which, it operates – stock and commodity exchanges, systems for mass production, just-in-time inventory management, commercial insurance, franchises, mail order catalogues, courier services, feeder airlines, producers’ and consumers’ cooperatives, marketing boards, export pro motion agencies, leasing, venture capital and mutual funds, credit and collection agencies, commodity brokers, real estate agents, trade unions, industrial associations, industrial estates, exclusive export processing zones and countless others.
 Our knowledge of transitions will be complete and our capacity to abridge the time and costs of change will be full only when we have come to understand the role of these institutions and have found ways to develop them rapidly.
 The need for new institutions in Eastern Europe is apparent in all fields of commercial activity.
 It is particularly acute in agriculture.
 Hoarding, speculation by traders, regional shortages and price variations have been aggravated by the absence of alternative systems of distribution to replace the old centralized food procurement system.
 Privately operated commodity exchanges have sprung up to handle wholesale transactions.
 But unfamiliarity with such institutions, and the lack of a firm legal basis for enforcement of contracts and a system of grading and inspection to guarantee the quality of produce traded, have kept most buyers and sellers away.

General Rigoria had once been the Grand Marshal of the same Knightly Order that had trained Rodregas.
 The Order was unique in that it trained not just in the various martial arts but also in the magical, and recruited those who had magical power, but lacked the temperament or intelligence to be a sorcerer.
 Instead of working toward the power of sorcery, they underwent the Sigil ceremony, gaining a magical enhancement but losing the versatility of a true mage.
 Gaining such sigils was outlawed by the guide except for their own warriors, but the Order of the Soaring Heavens was also the traditional sources for the Gods own Paladins, and even the Celestial Guild had never dared to anger the gods by interfering with their use of sigils.
 Rigoria had been one of the greatest of the Order of the Soaring Heavens, but he had grown old and his health had failed him.
 When tempted by the Immortalists with a new body, he had accepted.
 Even though such action was anathema to the very teachings of the Order, he had become an officer of the Immortal Guards, and eventually their leader.
 Several of the most powerful Knights had over the centuries, formed the officer core of The Immortal Guards.
 These Knights traded their honor for near immortality in the Guards.
 The Immortal Guards were all sigil warriors with one or several magical enhancements.

 sources of powers of the Mage Guards spoke of abilities such as the operation of enchanting Shock, as the buff was also able to inhibit bound bodies with Dragonfang Powers, Hunter Doumes, Lightning Silver, Aqua Vies of Death, Coldburn, and Hourglass. Shock had

 They stayed locked in each other's arms, her tears soaking into his shirt, his tears dripping into her hair.
 At last, Rick, feeling weak and shaky, took Marie's hand and led her to the living room.
 They sat down on the sofa, and he drew her close.
 "I love you more than anything in the world," he whispered into her hair.
 "I love you too.
 But Rick--" "I understand.

I mean, if I’d been paying attention I would never have missed Carol Warner.
 We even had a class together.
 (laughs)  Here’s this blond chick, in a loose shirt that I couldn’t help but look down at two lovely mounds of white white flesh, and a little jean skirt that showed off legs as thick as bedposts, strong, muscular legs—she was on the track team, imagine that—and sweet Debbie, my first love, didn’t know what she was doing, introducing us.
 I mean she put the match to the fireworks and I think regretted it immediately.
 Apparently, Carol asked to meet me.
 Like a fan thing.
 But, man, it was love, lust, whatever, at first sight.
 We locked eyes.
 She left with me that night when the dance was over.
 And we fucked that first night in my little Toyota.

I reached up to remove the pendant from the hook and squeezed it tight in my fist.
 It felt good, like a connection, and I slid the leather chain over my head, pulling the pendant down to rest on my chest.
 It felt right there and I knew I should have been wearing it all along.
 As I let go, I realized I’d gotten blood on my hands, so I headed to the hall and poured water from the pitcher into a ceramic basin.
 Staring into the mirror was not my favorite pastime.
 It mostly made my head hurt.
 But I had to clean the blood from my face and straighten the nest of hair on my head.
 When I leaned forward, a flash caught my eye.
 For a moment I thought the pendant was reflecting light from somewhere in the dark hallway, but my brain must have been still muddled from sleep.
 I examined the stone closer and saw blood had gotten smudged there as well, so I rinsed it clean.

 maton, this stone, man, I didn’t need blood.<eop><eod> Though my skin surface and things besides still looked new, if not bad, my body was also drastically changed. The blades on my arm were being attached to the necklace for ritual, and the invisible color visible in Sam

He smiled at me when he saw me.
 “You okay?
 You freaked out before,” he asked, his voice full of concern.
 I nodded and answered shakily, “You know that I hate falling.
 You must have been scared too.” He hesitated.
 “Yes, I was, but I think I was more concerned that you would wake the dead with your screams and they would attack us too.” I smacked him lightly on the arm and laid down next to him.
 I stared at the sky.
 “So where are we?” “Well, our winged friend managed to get us out of the woods and near the mountains.
 You can see them over there.” He pointed off in the distance and I spotted the mountains towering above everything else.
 “That’s good, at least all of this wasn’t for nothing.” He sighed and closed his eyes.

A nice man, even a talented man.

 But, they never talked music, never.
 I would question them about the band, what it was like performing, what particular songs they played.
 They would keep switching the conversation, keep it moving away from music and onto neutral topics like TV shows or the church.
 And, it took me years to figure out what was going on.
 It was my mother, see.
 She thought music was not the kind of career a really useful cog in society’s machine should pursue.
 And she would be damned if her child was going to follow in his father’s footsteps.

I noticed a thin, red line on his cheek where a thrasher must have scratched him.

 Jason punched him in the side.
 “Listen to Emily.
 She’s actually right sometimes.” “Thank you, Jason.” She said cheerfully, “Huh wait, sometimes?” She raised an eyebrow at him.
 Jason scowled at her.
 “I’m admitting you’re sometimes right so don’t push it.” “Point taken.” She tucked the paper in her drawstring bag.

I was just tall enough to see over Rachel and take in what was going on in the rest of the room.
 James' eyes were still yellow, and he was still inching his way towards me, obviously undeterred by Jasmin's defection.
 The Hispanic girl carefully closed the distance between them, and then placed her slender, perfect dark hand on James' arm once again as she leaned in and whispered something in his ear.
 For a moment it seemed he was going to shake her off again but then he shuddered, shot Alec another dirty look, and stormed out of the room.
 The tiny form following after him looked like a fragile schooner trailing along the edge of a hurricane.
 The room seemed so calm after James disappeared that for a second I forgot Jessica was still half-crouched in the center of the room.
 Alec hadn't forgotten, and if the waves of tension and energy rolling off of him weren't as strong as the combined effects coming from all four of them, it still felt like the walls should explode outwards.
 Jessica seemed to shrink in on herself, and then she turned and ran away with a final hiss of defiance.
 Isaac looked up at Alec from the corner where he'd been quietly standing.
 Alec's almost imperceptible nod sent him in the same direction as Jessica.

When you boiled it all down, I had a grand total of two friends in Sanctuary.
 Rachel and Brandon, both of who seemed to dislike the other, and neither of whom I was really sure I could count on.
 It was fine to only have two friends, or even just one friend if you knew they would do everything they possibly could to make sure they wouldn't let you down.
 It was entirely different when you weren't sure you could trust the people around you.
 Brandon was too good to be true.
 I pretty much expected any day now he'd come to his senses and realize he could do a lot better.
 Right or not, it's hard to really become emotionally invested when you feel like that.
 Rachel on the other hand should have been the perfect friend, but I got the feeling she'd always choose her brother over me.
 I felt guilty for holding that against her, family should be important.
 Cindi's friends back in Minnesota had probably felt similarly, but I'd always been really careful not to make her choose between me and them.

 very beginning of the game, her 'grand decision' was a good thing too, but felt kinda awkward at what it would've been. Maybe I shouldn’t have been so selfish and stupid. The beauty of life is you sometimes find things that you can do, that you LOVE.

And hopefully my phone wouldn’t stop me like it did most nights.
 Monsters loved to come out at night and cause trouble.
 They never seem to rest, much to my annoyance.

 I managed to think about something other than creatures that go bump in the night as I drifted off to sleep.
 In the morning I changed and ran down stairs and left a note saying I was going out to eat with Jason, Emily and Seth.
 It took me minutes to speed down to the small breakfast restaurant in town.
 I chained up my bike and walked over to the plastic blue table my friends had occupied.
 I slid in next to Emily, who was talking about some book she had read recently.

 Albert smiled.
 "I know your card wasn't on the red side, but Mrs. Campbell asked me to stop by and go over a couple of steps you left out on your homework assignment from today.
 Since I just finished with Rachel and was over here already, I thought I'd show you the steps you're missing."
 I nodded my assent as I mentally filed away both his name and the girl's.
 Surprisingly enough, Albert was a good teacher, pointing out the steps I'd been skipping over, and even explaining why they were important.

According to a recent study, by 2040 China and India will be the first and third largest economies in the world.
 Together with Russia and Brazil, they could account for a larger portion of world GDP than today’s six largest industrialized nations.
 Population, which was perceived as a liability not long ago, now appears to be an asset.
 In reality, population, like nuclear energy and so many other things, is neutral.
 Its value depends on what we human beings make of it.
 Changing Demographic Profile of the West: Demographic studies indicate that steep declines in the growth of population in Europe, Japan and USA will create acute labour shortages and unprecedented long-term demand for migration of foreign workers or transplantation of work to developing countries.
 UN and other studies estimate that Europe would have to accept 150 million new immigrants over the next 25 years in order to maintain the present levels of working population and Japan would need to admit 600,000 immigrants annually for the next 50 years in order to maintain the size of its working population at the 1995 level.
 The US labour force is projected to stop growing by 2013.
 These findings support the view of the India Vision 2020 report that “This trend will further accelerate the outsourcing of production of goods and services to locations where infrastructure, ease of doing business, quality, costs and availability of labour are most attractive, which will be beneficial for many labour surplus countries like India.”
 Expanding World Trade: Trade is playing an increasing role in the economic growth of developing countries.

The establishment of the World Trade Organization paved the way for expanded markets for both developing and developed countries, fuelled a rapid expansion in World Trade, and wove strong bonds of interdependence between erstwhile antagonists across the globe from the Chinese mainland to North America.
 Larger private investment flows invigorated economic growth and made capital more accessible to larger numbers of people than ever before in human history.
 The European Union expanded to embrace newly democratic countries and blazed a path right through the former heartland of nationalism for the integration of the united peoples of Europe.
 Most important of all, the erstwhile very real and imminent threat of global confrontation and nuclear destruction radically diminished, spurred by negotiations between Russia and USA that have led to a 75 per cent reduction in the number of nuclear warheads stockpiled by both sides.
 ICPF’s report projected a vision of Uncommon Opportunities for rapid and radical advances in global peace and development.
 Its central thrust is the inextricable linkage between peace, employment, food security and human development.
 As peace is a sine quo non for development, creation of employment opportunities for all is essential for maintenance of peace and social stability, food security and eradication of all forms of poverty.
 The experience of the past decade strongly supports the view that a more peaceful global environment is more conducive for development.
 Military spending declined by a third in the years immediately following the end of the Cold War, partly due to real cuts in defence spending and partly due to the collapse of the Russian rouble and changes in the value attributed to Soviet arms spending.
 These real gains did not translate into a significant increase in foreign aid, which was what many hoped and expected.

 membership agreement between ICPF and its Western partners, which was approved by the Russian Imperial Federation on January 1 amounted to a much more three-year ready-made contract, resulting in salary payments of billions of dollars in Russian alone, tied to GDP rather than compensation and in collective career development.

 Once again it boggled my mind that they could all live with so little privacy.
 Alec interrupted my thoughts.
 "I'm sorry to have ruined your night.
 I wanted it to be perfect.
 I should have known that wasn't possible.
 Not with everything hanging over our heads."
 It felt funny to smile.
 The gesture belonged with perfect times, not ones in which people other than me were having nervous breakdowns.
 Then again, a bad night with Alec still somehow managed to beat most other good nights.

I faded in and out of the various discussions, listening occasionally but never talking.
 Steed seemed very aware of me, watching me in a way no one ever had.
 It must have been obvious, because when he excused himself to check the herd, Chevelle studied me, sliding a strand of my now-black hair through his fingers.
 “It suits you.” It was a familiar gesture and it should have made me flinch.
 Maybe it was the wine, but as I looked at him, my anger was fading.
 The way he’d reacted when Fannie had struck me, the caress against my cheek, those were not the actions of a council elder.
 As we sat so near, it was hard to believe the concern wasn’t real.
 His eyes burned with intensity; they seemed even darker now.
 Dark… like mine.

There were so many lineages, but I needed something on the northern clans, something on Vattier, and Junnie didn’t have that.
 I’d need a library, maybe even the Council library.
 I shivered; I definitely wasn’t sure about that.
 Even if I worked up the nerve to sneak in, I didn’t have the magic to search documents to quickly find what I was after like the Council members did.
 I would have to stick to the village library.
 I made a short excuse to Junnie and headed out the door and around back.
 After I rounded a few houses, I cut back toward the village center.

 For once Harruq has not only felt regret but done something about it.
 For once Qurrah has seen that the darkness he follows is not the absolute power it claims to be.

Rodregas knew enough of magic to understand that the purpose of this circle was to keep out unwanted magical influences.
 They could interfere with the spell casting inside the circle.
 Also, the circle would hold in any magical forces inside which someone wanted to store or manipulate.
 Inside the large circle were four smaller circles.
 Rodregas’ eyes immediately went to the one on the north side made of blue sand, where inside sigils made of a yellow waxy substance laid a giant lion.
 This was not a normal lion such as those found in the nearby forest, but a giant beast.
 Ravenhurr had been lucky indeed.
 He had been able to buy several Dire Cats from the Immortalist Guild dealer Taiga.
 With magic, he caused them to go into heat.
 It was known to be very difficult to affect Dire beasts with magic, and his success had shown his power and accomplishment as a mage.

Johnny – So, where’s the downside to that?
 Jim – It’s just not Gene’s way.
 He likes to create a nuisance and a spectacle.
 He’s better at the former than at the latter, but he does try.

 That would really piss Gene off.

 Before he stopped watching, however, he saw more than fifty similar white dots line the horizon.
 The guard captain smiled, somehow heartened by the sight.
 “Let us hope for miracles,” he whispered to the night.
 “And let us hope that at tomorrow’s end all my troops are still alive.”
 He stared at the stars for a long while before joining his troops in slumber.

I felt my eyes go wide as I realized what he was saying.
 It made me think of the stray kitten we'd taken in for a few months when I was five.
 Cindi and I had spent hours teasing it with pieces of string, watching its tiny head dart back and forth from one to the other as it tried to decide whether to pounce on them, or dart away and hide under the bed.
 It'd been really amusing when it had been a half-pound kitten, but the thought of having a two-hundred-plus pound wolf attacking me because I'd triggered some kind of fight or flight instinct wasn't so funny.
 "Oh, I didn't realize it was a problem.
 I'll stop."
 Alec laughed.

I mean (laughs), c’mon, look at all the space that fucker took up and all it did was play the radio or your LPs.
 Funny, looking back on it.
 I only remember my mother playing Englebert Humperdink.
 I still love “Please Release Me,” man, that song makes me cry.
 And those old big band records.
 Shit, I like that old stuff, Glenn Miller, the Dorseys.
 Later, I got into FM 100, when it was a force, when it played stuff that inspired.
 They played us, I think the first place to play us.
 Anyway, ha, that stereo.
 Naw, my parents didn’t play much music.

There was a pause at his question.
 He knew this was an important moment because once people say who they are they are much less likely to do violence.
 Rodregas did not understand the reason, but he knew that to be true.
 “I am Imeralda,” said the AElf maiden.
 Then came the Hellborn, “My name is Doi’vanaomeraldioan, but humans usually call me Doi’van,” he stated in a slow careful way in a very deep, deep voice.
 The leader, after a pause, said, “I am Audrian of family Corin.” The other two men identified themselves as Brit and Geor.
 Geor, the one with the torch, was blond and like the other men, unusually good looking and well built.
 Brit said little and was of dark hair and light skin.
 Offhand, Rodregas thought he looked to have come from the northern Kingdoms.
 “Gerald was a friend of ours, we went through a lot together in the Raven Keep dungeon,” spoke Audrian.

It was foggier than usual--was that an indication that there'd be a door or window or whatever back to 1927?
 Now that he'd told her he loved her, had opened his heart to her completely, he couldn't bear the thought that she might not walk back into his arms.
 So when he at last saw her moving through the fog, he ran to snatch her up.
 "Marie," he sighed into her hair.
 She could barely breathe but didn't want to be released.
 When he at last set her down, she continued to cling to him.
 "I wish you didn't have to go to work today."
 He was surprised by her words.
 "Do you want me to call in sick?"
 She drew back to look at him.

The biggest surprise was probably Geriodon, who had beaten Rodregas earlier that day.
 Rodregas could not argue against sharing the minor sigil as he clearly fit the description of a worthy candidate.
 Geriodon was more than happy to swear that he had no love for the Guild and that Justice should be dealt to all equally.
 But before accepting the sigil he wanted to be sure that any Shadow Order he joined was mostly about secrecy to protect themselves, and that he would still be able to compete for true knighthood in the Order of the Soaring Heavens.
 Rodregas dropped into his cot tired and exhausted.
 Even with his healing sigil he had needed a full night’s rest, but duty did not wait for what a man needed.
 Imeralda woke him slightly after dawn, and Rodregas could tell that both she and Doi’van had spent the few hours left of the night working on what was left of their equipment.
 The tear in both his leather shirt and chain were sewn up, the first with thread the second with steel wire.
 For a mace, Doi’van had bought a piece of round solid steel from the smithy.
 It was a crude thing but of the proper size to qualify for the tournament.

I thought about asking for more details, but it felt wrong, like reading someone else's e-mail.
 Besides, I was pretty sure Rachel would tell me it was Jasmin's story, and I'd just have to go to her with my questions.
 The music picked up slightly, and Jasmin and Alec sped up with it.
 They were moving so quickly now it almost seemed they were better than Isaac and Jessica.
 A quick visual search laid that question to rest though.
 I could just make out Isaac's towering form across the pavilion in the corner where they'd apparently gone to find room for some of their more impressive moves.
 It seemed amazing to me that they were willing to move so quickly around normal, uninformed humans, but apparently they figured professional dancers were at least as quick.
 I shook my head and turned back to Rachel, only to feel my throat constrict as I saw Britney.
 Not only was she wearing a tight, black dress that made her look at least twice as hot as me, she also happened to be draped across Brandon's arm.
 I was so caught up watching Britney that it took me several seconds to notice the differences in her date.

Rodregas could not pronounce the ancient version of the Eastern Common language Ravenhurr was using, but he thought that he understood the gist of the meaning.
 Rodregas could not believe the man did not try to battle his way out.
 The captain and Dale were both large men but it would have been very difficult to keep such a gifted athlete in the circle, even with clubs, if he was determined to escape.
 However, he was young and clearly lacked battle experience.
 He seemed unsure of what to do.
 Then it was too late; the blue flames of the circle rose high, then inward, and engulfed him.
 The young man started to split in two.
 The physical man stood there, but as he watched, another ethereal version, the man’s spirit, his very non-corporal essence, was suddenly pulled from his body, and then whipped around and out of the burning circle.
 Rodregas was not sure, but as this ethereal version of the man was pulled apart, Rodregas thought he could see him screaming.
 Rodregas pulled his eyes away from the horrifying vision as the corporal man went from looking confused and unsure to having no expression at all, like an empty piece of meat.

Will you be alright?” he asked Imeralda.
 She nodded and seemed relieved as she headed right for the doorway of the One Tree.
 Rodregas feared for her.
 He was not sure what the consequences would be if she touched the One Tree.
 He wanted to follow her, but he followed Doi’van into the Infernal chamber instead.
 “Was it his own Infernal power calling him?” He wondered.
 Rodregas and Doi’van circled the chamber.
 Rodregas was not as familiar with the daemons of the Infernal Realms as he was the great beasts of the Celestial Realm.
 He sat looking at a wolf with the tail of a serpent but with large beautiful white wings.
 Then he slowly walked next to a great bull with bat wings and a head that appeared to be very human.

Harruq stepped in front of Qurrah and then turned, staring down a group of five heavily armored guards.
 Swords and clubs hung from their belts, though a fifth carried a weapon neither of them had ever seen before.
 It was a wooden stick with a bulbous gem on one end.
 “You stop when asked or pay the price,” said one of the guards.
 “If he can even understand us,” said another.
 “We understand perfectly,” Qurrah said, stepping to one side.
 “What has my brother done to warrant your attention?”

In order to provide employment for every job seeker, the world needs to create approximately one billion new jobs during the next decade.
 This will require a job growth rate of more than 4 per cent per year compared to the less than 3 per cent achieved during the 1980s.
 About 95 per cent of the growth in the world labour force over the next 35 years will take place in developing countries.
 An additional 260 million people will enter the workforce during the 1990s.
 Employment in the East Asian economies is projected to grow by 37 per cent between 1990 and 2000, while the labour force will increase by only 17 per cent, leading to an increasing shortage of labour in the region.
 In contrast, employment growth is projected to lag behind labour force growth in South Asia, Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa.
 Although job growth has once again started in many OECD countries, economic growth alone will not be sufficient to bring down unemployment rates significantly, especially among youth and the long-term unemployed.
 Changes in values, attitudes, structures and policies will be necessary.
 Unless concerted action steps are taken, global unemployment will increase by 130 million during the 1990s.
 Our thesis is that there is a great deal that can be done to prevent this outcome and even reverse the trend, leading to sharply reduced levels of unemployment and progressive eradication of poverty over the next decade.

Part of me hadn't wanted to.
 It had felt like I was abandoning Cindi by doing so, but just seeing Cindi's half of the twin pendants we'd received two years before had been enough to send me into a tailspin.
 A detached part of me noted that it was just like Mom to have lied about having lost Cindi's.
 She'd known I couldn't handle the reminder of what we'd lost, but she'd been unwilling to give up that link to the past.
 The thought slipped away like sunlight skipping across water a split second before the storm arrived.
 The attack was a bad one.
 I lost more time.
 I must have slept at some point, but the next time I surfaced it was Saturday morning and I was sitting in front of an empty bowl with an unopened box of cereal and a gallon of milk waiting in the wings.

 She'd see an elegant necktie that would be perfect for Rick and then realize she could never give it to him.

The elf in the window leaned out to unleash a killing strike, but it was Qurrah who did the killing.
 Four pieces of bone leapt from his hand.
 They hit the elf’s neck and temple, making a satisfying crack.
 The archer spilled through the window and landed with a clattering thud.
 “The rest are yours, brother,” he whispered.

It was like the air had become thick, and although the fine strands of hair on the back of my neck hadn't moved, it felt like they should be standing on end.
 I heard indistinct sobbing, and then the voice returned and made me shiver.
 The sensation started somewhere on my back, and traveled forward like it was clawing to get out of my face.
 "I know you're sorry, just like you were sorry before.
 Only I don't really believe you, so we're instituting a new policy.
 If I catch you sniffing around him again, I'll kill you.
 No questions asked."
 My pulse skyrocketed as the raw terror hit.
 I'd heard death threats a couple of times before.
 You don't go to a school of any size without seeing fights, and usually by the time girls resort to physical confrontations they really are serious about hurting the other person.

I simply did not like you, and the way you hung out with non-Celestials.
 It is unnatural.
 Now, it is my turn to ask a question.” “Actually,” interrupted Rodregas, “you already asked me about being an old soldier.
 Let me answer that first.
 I was a sergeant in Ravenhurr’s guard and I am afraid I have become what I learned to hate more than anything, an Immortalist.” Rodregas paused and took a deep breath.
 What he said next was hard even for himself to say, “In truth, I am an old man who had his time on this world and did not do much with it.
 But now I have stolen the body of a very promising young man.
 I will die feeling guilty for what I have done, but I plan to take a few of you with me.
 Now, it is my turn for a question,” he said.
 Rodregas hoped that Imeralda would do whatever she was going to do soon; the conversation was escalating and he did not think they had much time before things got deadly.

A man was in the shower, and someone was singing.
 There were quick images of a woman in the shower, then a little girl, now the mother was wrapping a towel about herself, now she was toweling the girl's hair .

 Marie tore her eyes from the picture to stare at Rick.
 "What is that?"
 "What?

 It's an ad--an advertisement for soap."

Seth smirked.
 “Nope, it's going to haunt you for the rest of your life.” He made ghost sounds.
 “Wait,” I said suddenly, “weren't you going to tell Emily and Jason about you-know-what?” “What?” Seth asked lazily and plucked at the grass.
 I sat up and glared at him.
 “What do you mean, 'what'?
 You said you were going to tell them!
 I'm going to tell them if you aren't.” I stood up, but Seth was faster.
 He grabbed my arm.
 I stood there and stared at him.
 “Please Jazell, let me tell them myself,” he begged.

I'll follow your lead, and try to look brave."
 He threw the door open and stalked into the house.
 Rachel grabbed my hand and pulled me along behind her.
 A group of familiar faces was waiting for us in the largest living room I'd ever seen.
 It took me several seconds to match identities to the rain-soaked group staring at me with such hostility.
 Jasmin was standing in the center, and didn't even wait for me to get fully in the room before she started talking.
 "She goes back to Brandon tonight.
 It's a long shot, but it's better than nothing.
 She brought it on herself so there isn't any reason to cry over what might happen."

She'd nearly burned down the house as a kid.
 I was halfway to the front door before Mom grabbed my arm and turned me back towards the kitchen.
 "I can't believe you.
 You really would have left without realizing it was your birthday?"
 Ugh.
 No wonder I had a headache.
 My brain must have been working overtime in an effort to block out the fact I was now another year older.
 "Thanks, Mom."
 I blew out the candle, and turned to leave again, but didn't even get to take a step this time.
 "Hold on there.

If the school was paying for the tickets I should just be glad I hadn't been stuck with a standing room only spot.
 Still, as disappointing as it was that the performers were only barely going to be visible, it wasn't as bad as the nagging worry that Rachel wasn't coming after all.
 We'd spent almost every second together talking about how much fun we were going to have seeing Les Misérables together.
 She'd even still been excited about the bus ride.
 Given everything she'd said, I'd anxiously waited for her to show up at the departure point.
 It'd seemed impossible, but as Mrs. Alexander had gently herded me onto the bus, there'd still been no sign of her.
 "Maybe she's driving instead of taking the bus down.
 I seem to remember someone saying her brother had purchased a ticket.
 He isn't here, so possibly they're going down together."
 It'd been a fairly slender thread upon which to hang my hopes.

With lots of desserts?” He chuckled.
 “I know just the place.” Rick’s attentiveness calmed her, and she went to bed that night with a full stomach and an odd sense of security.
 Nothing about what had happened to her made sense, but Rick was right.
 If she had to walk out of 1927 into another time, she was fortunate she’d walked into his time.
 The week went by quickly.
 Marie always began the day with a walk in the garden, and Rick always hugged her and dried her tears when she returned.
 When he left for work, she'd exercise and watch movies he'd rented for her and clean the house with the supplies she'd discovered.
 In the evenings they'd eat and talk and watch TV, but he promised to take her to the shore Saturday.
 "The first thing we have to do is buy you a bathing suit," Rick told Marie as they strolled through the mall after dinner Friday evening.

 “Nonsense,” she said.
 She guided a hand across his chest, feeling the break.
 Her hand then traveled to his shoulder, and a deep frown grew across her face.
 “Who did this to you?” she asked.
 “The man in black, the one continuing to train the half-orcs.
 I approached him last night and he nearly killed me.”

The elf shrugged.
 Her hands hugged her sides, her walnut eyes filled with worry.
 “The elves are going to fight today, Harruq.
 I’m sure you’ve heard why.”
 “Are you going to join them?” he asked.
 The elf nodded.
 “They are my family.
 This is my home.
 I cannot abandon them.”

None of it was fiddled with, enhanced, whatever.
 Except that playful tape loop, and that fade-out on “For Kim,” that’s just us, beating our brains out in that little studio, high on bennies.
 “For Kim, Because it Went by So Fast”---we worked our asses off to get that one right.
 I don’t know what was wrong really.
 It was a song I’d written right before we went into the studio, so we’d never done it live—maybe that was the reason we struggled with it.
 But, the lyrics, you know, they’re a little complex: “I took my Melville out into the sun, what else could I do, I was in my twenties” it begins.
 Not exactly pop schmaltz,  you know, ABAB.
 It was a more complex rhythm to the whole speaking—and I did just sort of speak the lyrics—that was Jim.
 At first I wanted to sing it—you know, I’d worked out a melody, a weird melody.
 And he said, on, I don’t know, the like 16th try, Jim said, shit, let’s not sing this one.

In horror, she returned to intense and persistent prayer, telling God he couldn’t possibly mean she should leave her family, could he?
 Rather than reply with words, he used silence, like Tae Kwon Do Master Jeong used to do when one of us students offered an excuse for not training often enough.
 For weeks she waited, listened, and prayed God would at last reply that he had only been using the method through which he tested Abraham’s willingness to obey at any cost.
 Once she declared herself ready to forsake her family, he would release her from the need to do so.
 But he didn’t release her.
 She gathered together her husband and kids, all of whom she adored and treasured.
 The kids were age 9, 12, and 15.
 She told them she needed to leave.
 At first they didn’t believe her.
 Then they cried.

I followed Seth through the trees.
 This time there were less of them and the only ones that around us looked half dead.
 The bark was peeling off and I could see the tree branches leaning towards the ground.
 The air was cold and heavy, like a mound of snow on your shoulders.
 The trees parted to show a cliff.
 We walked up to the edge and the wind whipped at my face.
 A feeling of déjà vu came upon me.
 I knew where we were because I had been here before.
 “Seth, I was here in my dream, the one with Kojas and the dwarf,” I said.
 His eyes widened and he looked down at the ground below, obviously trying to imagine what it had looked like.

It was probably no less than the strike that he received in return.
 But Rodregas was able to hold on to his big steed and absorb the blow.
 His opponent landed on the ground with a crash.
 When you were knocked off your mount you had the choice to get back on again and face the same opponent.
 The winner of two out of three rounds won the whole match.
 Rodregas’ opponent did not get up.
 He circled around and checked on the man.
 Rodregas could not tell if the man was alive or dead so he dismounted and took off the man’s helm.
 The man was covered in sweat and was surprisingly old.
 He was clearly alive, if unconscious.

Becoming an adult, that’s got to be the big change.
 It’s about the biggest there is.” He picked up a handful of sand and let it sift through his fingers.
 “I wish it was.
 I mean, I shouldn’t.
 That’s just being a coward, to wish for things to stay like they are.
 We ought to get excited about changes.
 You, for instance, you ought to jump at the chance to go to Pepperdine.” Though I only remember my mom going to church for funerals, or as far as the front door to pick up a free copy of the Christian Science Monitor, her preference for my education was Pepperdine, a Christian college.
 I suppose she hoped I might find guidance there.

Like many things in life since he left Raven Keep, he cherished the feel, the taste, and the smell.
 Then she broke away and whispered, “I am afraid.” Imeralda spoke so quietly that he could barely hear.
 “I want to,” she paused and then continued her light whisper, “But being a half Nymph, half AElf means it is not easy to become involved with for a human.
 I don’t want to hurt you.” He missed her taste as she pulled away, and he was surprised by what she said, but he also knew that he no longer wanted to live in fear.
 “Shhhhh, it is all right.
 With me you never have to worry, you never have to be afraid.” He was going to tell her that he would not hurt her, but since she seemed afraid that she would be the one hurting him, he held the comment back.
 He just pulled her close again, but instead of a soft kiss he kept himself from touching her and simply looked deep into her eyes and thought about how much he appreciated her.
 Rodregas let her feel how much he thought of her.
 Only after he saw her eyes make a decision, did he slide his hands down her body and cup the small of her back and pull her into a kiss, but this time he let more of his passion and need show.
 With his kiss her resistance evaporated and she went from hesitant to eager.

It is the educational system that imparts to future generations the accumulated knowledge, skill and capacity acquired in the past.
 The quality of that education will determine the quality of the human beings who build our future world.
 Until now, too much emphasis has been placed on transfer of information from teacher to student, too little on the development of thinking and critical faculties by the student.
 Too much reliance has been placed on the capacity of the teacher to teach, too little on the inherent natural capacity of human beings for self-motivated learning and self-discovery.
 It may be fair to say that the state of our educational systems throughout the world is an accurate reflection of the state of human development in different societies.
 In this context, the UN Millennium Goals of achieving universal primary education and eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary education represent the bare minimum commitment that every society must make to enhance the capacities of its youth.
 The great Tamil poet, Subramanya Bharati, rightly emphasized that nutrition and education are the two legs of a human being.
 Pre-school education should receive as much attention as post-graduate education.
 At the other end of the development spectrum, no society has yet developed the knowledge and expertise to impart the best of what it has acquired to a broad cross-section of its citizens.
 Few have been able to ignite the aspiration for continuous learning and the capacity for original creativity that are the most profound characteristics of human consciousness.

“Doi’van, are you mad at me?
 Is this something to do with me and Imeralda… getting together last night?” Rodregas asked.
 “What do you mean?” Doi’van asked clearly surprised.
 “No, I can’t say it is a good idea.
 Mixing more than casually with Nymphs always leads to problems, but it is not my problem.
 In fact,” he said with a careful glance around him.
 “I would have jumped at the chance myself.” “I am probably too ugly by both AElf and Nymph standards for her to be interested.
 Then again, you know Nymphs; they are naturally polyamorous and very sexual.
 It is a shock that she was not already sexually involved with one or both of us already.” Doi’van added, “Maybe her AElf blood means she does not have as strong a sex drive as most Nymphs since AElven marriage bonds are always monogamous.
 By the Celestial gods she is half AElf and half Nymph, who knows what to expect.

It was easily eight feet tall, covered in thick fur, and had bloody claws as long as my hands tipping the ends of its fingers.
 My vision was still swimming enough that I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing.
 Even so, there was no way to ignore the bloodstained mouth as it got closer.
 I had a moment to realize I was still going to die all alone, and then the blackness came for me.

That was freshman year.
 That was while I was starting to play everywhere around town—I was like almost famous, you know.
 Locally.
 Dickinson was there for me, and the gigs started happening and, I had this cheerleader girlfriend, with thighs like hell-roosters, hard, and a great little butt.
 Life was good.
 Classes, shit man, how could anyone concentrate on classes with that going on?
 Most of my teachers hated me anyway, you know, rock and roll, devil’s music, my hair was longer than most of my classmates, I insisted on wearing these combat boots, even in summer when sweating in them was like wearing a swamp on each foot, and I had attitude, of course.
 Rock and roll attitude.
 I was unassailable, untouchable.
 Of course the teachers hated me.

 and I hated all of my music, but hell, anyway “my” music, if you were stringed, straight-laced music, theoma, or junk, made of crap and you were not, okay. Devil’s music is—my favorite music.<eop> I starred in high school

He found nothing to convince him otherwise as he quickly scanned the village.
 He found many homes left wide open, yet none answered him when he called inside.
 Everywhere, staining the earth a dark crimson, there was blood.
 “It is as I feared,” he whispered to the night.
 He stood, took his bow off his shoulder, and then thoroughly searched the town.
 He found no trace of life barring a few rats that fed off the now unguarded remnants of food.
 Several homes, those with their doors smashed open, had gore smeared on their floors.
 One pained Dieredon’s heart greatly; amid a great red circle on a wooden floor laid a small, bloodstained doll.
 He said a silent prayer before moving on.

“No!” Harruq shouted.
 He pulled out one of his healing potions, yanked off the cork, and forced the contents down Aurelia’s throat.

 Harruq got out his last potion but could not open it for the shaking of his hands.
 Desperate, he put it down, picked up one of his swords, and shattered the top of the vial.
 He flung the potion back to Aurelia’s mouth, nearly shredding her lower lip on the broken glass.
 More of the silvery-blue liquid poured down her throat.
 Harruq sat there, clutching her hands in his and waiting.
 The seconds crawled slower than the longest of years.

I knew I'd gotten a little carried away.
 The prime rule of high school survival involved avoiding situations people could use to ridicule you later, but I'd really wanted a rational explanation for my dreams.
 They seemed so real.
 I needed a friendly face to get me through the rest of class.
 Remembering Alec's smile from earlier, I looked over at him, hoping he'd return my sheepish grin.
 It was almost like he was a different person.
 The smile was gone.
 It'd been replaced with a steely mask that almost completely hid his emotions.
 Only the look in his eyes, and the mechanical pencil in his hand, neatly snapped into two pieces, told me he was mad, that something very much like hatred was washing through him.

 “I’d have him drinking through a brand new hole in his neck.”
 “How skilled are you with those?” Qurrah asked, gesturing at the swords in the grass next to Harruq.
 Even though they lived in such cramped quarters, Qurrah still knew very little of Harruq’s life other than what he did at his request.

His doubt faded with each step.
 All was identical to his dreams.
 A mile from town, he saw the hill, a smoldering fire atop it to guide his way.
 Waiting there was the dark man, his red eyes shining down on him as he approached.
 “Say the words,” the man in the black robe ordered.
 His voice was quiet but deep, a mixture of hate and malice compressed into audible form.
 “How can I make such a promise to one whose name I don’t know?” Qurrah asked.
 In answer, the man in black stood.
 His eyes flared and his arms spread wide.
 All his power rolled forth, and on trembling knees the half-orc looked upon a man more ancient than the forests, more powerful than the fury of nature, and more death than life.

Despite enormous expansion of educational and training institutions, most developing countries suffer from a shortage of quality vocational skills among the huge number of people at lower levels of the society who seek desperately to raise their standard of living.
 This shortage retards the growth in productivity and quality needed to meet domestic needs and achieve international competitiveness.
 The technical training in frastructure in these countries should be expanded by the establishment of craft and vocational training institutes at the local level in every community to impart a wide range of basic technical skills.
 A massive programme of basic vocational and skills training should be launched on a parallel with the 100 per cent literacy programmes that are now being promoted by many governments to wipe out rural illiteracy.
 The military in many developing countries possesses the organizational capabilities and experience with intensive training to assist with this task.
 An institutional gap exists in agricultural training systems.
 In most developing countries, agricultural colleges, universities and polytechnics train researchers, government, bank employees and extension officers, but not farmers.
 Producing more food with less water, less chemicals and less soil erosion requires high levels of skill.
 The chain of agricultural training needs to be filled out at the lower level by establishing thousands of village-level farm schools as proposed in the chapter on food security.
 The switch from centrally planned to market-oriented economic systems in Eastern Europe cannot be successful until the population has acquired the skills needed to function effectively in the new economic environment.

Mrs. Tranton gazed down at her for a moment.
 "I'm sorry, darling."
 She kissed Marie's forehead and left.
 Marie curled up next to Rick's t-shirt still clutching his handkerchief.
 She felt so empty.
 She didn't sleep well that night but woke up early nevertheless.
 After bathing, she put on her emerald underwear and a simple white dress and went out into the garden.
 It didn't look so different from Rick's, she decided.
 They didn't have any white roses like he did, nor an electric fountain, but they had red roses and azaleas, just as he did.
 She wished she'd brought back a picture of him.

I picked him up hitchhiking.
 He settled into the seat, set his Bible on his lap, stared at me for a minute and asked, “Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior?” “Yep,” I said, and readied myself to field the standard subsequent questions.
 Tony said, “Oh.

 Cliff’s not much of a talker.
 I believe nobody heard his stories from Vietnam until years afterward.
 I don’t pry, so I can’t be sure what goes on inside him, but I have no reason to think he believes in God, or that he doesn’t.
 But whether he believes or not, Cliff has gotten well blessed since our evening with Billy Graham.
 He has four wonderful kids, and Toni, who is one of those rarest of people who appear to grow brighter, stronger, and more beautiful every year.

He wished he could make this moment last forever.
 Rodregas believed that most women did not know if they were interested until a man makes his move.
 It is something instinctive; there is a single moment when either it clicks or it does not.
 The moment held unmoving, the dice were rolling; and she responded to his kiss, but did not sink into his arms.
 She was making a hard decision.
 Rodregas felt good that she must feel something to hesitate; the moment seemed to go on forever.
 He drank in her smell.
 Like her it was unique, something between a honey blossom and a ripe apple.
 Like many things in life since he left Raven Keep, he cherished the feel, the taste, and the smell.
 Then she broke away and whispered, “I am afraid.” Imeralda spoke so quietly that he could barely hear.

 I am no enemy in this moment. “I am very aware of what you are experiencing now. And I am quite sure that you are also aware of this.’” I fled her voice. She questioned herself and knew what she was feeling the most; pleasure and unemotional reaction.

I was halfway to the front door before Mom grabbed my arm and turned me back towards the kitchen.
 "I can't believe you.
 You really would have left without realizing it was your birthday?"
 Ugh.
 No wonder I had a headache.
 My brain must have been working overtime in an effort to block out the fact I was now another year older.
 "Thanks, Mom."
 I blew out the candle, and turned to leave again, but didn't even get to take a step this time.
 "Hold on there.
 Do you always skip breakfast now?"

The boys looked completely satisfied with how we looked.
 After Emily and I gave them a look, they tore down the street and disappeared.
 Emily squeezed the bottom of her shirt, “I hate them so much right now.” Water gushed onto the street.
 I wrung my hair out.
 “I agree and if we didn’t need them, I’d be planning their funeral.” Emily smiled, “I’d be helping you.
 Do you think they would like pink coffins?” “Totally,” I laughed and grabbed my dry bag.
 “Let’s go home.
 Want to crash at my place?” Emily flipped open her phone, her fingers danced on the keys and paused.
 Then they clicked and she shoved it in her pocket.
 “Yup I can.” “You’re always one step ahead.” “Always.” “So what do you think we should do?” Emily asked from my bed later on.

Fear?

If Geriodon became a knight at least an honorable man had the day.
 Several of the squires were being seen to by attendants making sure everything was secure, and waiting for the start of the match.
 Rodregas thought he was alone until he heard Imeralda speak from behind him, “Did you see who is watching from the Great Hall’s door?” she asked.
 Rodregas glanced over, it was Van’dret.
 He stood tall and handsome, young squires surrounding him ready to serve.
 Rodregas thought that the Immortalist was watching him.
 He would have to leave quickly after the tournament, as the man was growing suspicious of them.
 Rodregas would have loved to kill him, but Van’dret was a powerful sorcerer capable of magic that made him nearly impossible to kill.

I'd won a ticket.
 Me, the person who never won anything, was going to get to see the greatest musical of all time.
 I smiled and thanked everyone who yelled back congratulations, and then turned to find Alec staring at me.
 "Congratulations, Adriana.
 Les Misérables is one of the best.
 I hope you enjoy it."
 I thanked him sweetly, and even managed a smile, but I wanted to tell him he was a jerk.
 I'd been desperate to win a ticket, and he had to take yet another opportunity to rub in the fact that he'd already seen it.
 That he was rich enough to see it anywhere in the world as often as he wanted to.
 Even my desire to tell Alec off wasn't strong enough to overcome the pure joy at having won.

I found myself just outside the tutor lab with no recollection of having stumbled to my locker, or going by Physics to grab the stuff I'd left there.
 Still, somehow my Spanish book had disappeared, replaced by my math book.
 My knees started shaking as I entered the room, but I made it safely to my normal table before they gave out.
 "Adri, Adriana?
 Excuse me."
 I didn't recognize the girl standing across from me, but based on her uncomfortable expression and the fact that more than one person had turned for the sole purpose of watching us out of the corner of their eyes, she'd been standing there longer than I'd realized.
 Apparently my looking up was enough of a response for her to proceed.
 "I've got a note from Mrs. Campbell.
 She asked me to deliver it to you."
 I managed something that could just barely be construed as a thank you, took the note, and watched her leave.

“This way,” Rodregas said to her.
 As he separated her from the male prisoner he whispered to her, “If you want to live, don’t do anything until your circle starts to burn, then I will throw the club at the other guard.
 Run and make sure you get out of the circle.” She jerked towards him as he spoke and Rodregas was struck once again by the beauty of her amazing eyes, but he forced her forward hoping that she could think on her feet.
 Rodregas carefully led her over the outer white circle and into a yellow circle that was across from the Celestial Lion.
 Captain Poir led the man into the pale green circle that was the closest to being in the exact middle and was most strongly interconnected to the other circles.
 As Rodregas crossed into the main circle, the sense of power almost made him stumble.
 He knew his own power was minimal, not much above average, but his few years of training as a boy had opened him up to magic more than the other three guards on the tower roof.
 Rodregas knew that if Ravenhurr had ever thought he had more than basic magic training he would long have been reassigned to a duty far from the ceremony.
 The very air seemed to strum like a stringed instrument with the gathered magical power.
 Rodregas could not help but think about how out of his depth he was trying to interfere with the ritual ceremony.

The process was so smooth, I couldn’t say exactly what had happened.
 Chevelle was changing.
 Or, more likely, he was becoming more himself.
 He wasn’t as formal.
 He seemed relaxed, and apparently magic, quick and powerful, was intertwined into his every routine.
 He didn’t need to do much by hand; I would have spent hours trying to build a spit and skin an animal.
 An old question came back to me and I asked, “How do you hunt?” “Hmm?” “You don’t have a bow,” I explained.
 “What do you use to hunt?” He hesitated, as if deciding what to tell me.
 “I use magic, Frey.” He looked like he was waiting for me to be upset.
 “Oh.” I contemplated his answer.

 Harruq groaned, spitting out dirt that had made its way into his mouth.
 “Where are we?” he asked.
 “About two miles east of Woodhaven,” she told him.

When he finally dared a loud, gasping breath of air, the pain was not so bad.

 He expected to see his body dead in the street, for why else had he still not returned?
 He held hope that Harruq still fought against his enemies, or that more had come beyond the three the elf had claimed.
 What he was not prepared for was the sight of Harruq hunched over the dying body of Aurelia Thyne.
 “Harruq,” he tried to call out.
 The flesh in the back of his throat tore.
 Blood poured down his throat, slick and hot.
 Qurrah cursed.
 Such a wound would kill him if he did not seek help.

 I have never used my heritage in any way since that day.
 It felt wrong to me that because of my ancestry I could be hired, but I needed a job and this one paid well.
 I worked the 3:00 pm to midnight shift bagging groceries and stocking shelves.
 The money was good and it helped me provide for myself.
 I purchased a 1967 Chevelle SS for $1,000 and I spent a lot of time and money trying to make it faster than the next.
 Hot Rods were as popular in the 70’s as I remembered them in the days of Bob’s Big Boy Drive Ins.
 I adored working on this Chevelle and meeting others who enjoyed the same passion.
 Even though I lived on my own, I was still a kid and I knew no better than to live like one.

 Two of the other three, a boy and a girl I recognized from second hour, but whose names I couldn't even begin to remember, were already packing their books into a pair of book bags, one of which was a fairly utilitarian item, the other of which probably cost as much as my whole wardrobe.
 I couldn't place the last boy for all that he looked really familiar.
 He had incredibly dark skin and features with a slight Middle Eastern cast.
 When he shifted in his seat, I realized he was built like a football player.
 Not like a lineman, but like a running back, or maybe a quarterback.

He stared at me as if I were a delusion, a dream looking back at him.
 He was speechless and it occurred to me that perhaps elves were not a part of this human’s knowledge.
 I wondered if he would recover soon.
 I considered abandoning him and returning to watch the others, but his face was so interesting, the emotions so plain and readable there.
 But he wasn’t afraid.
 It was awe.
 I decided to have a little fun with him.
 They couldn’t possibly be dangerous.

 He merely stood gawking at me.

 “Did they use all the ones you prepared last night?” “You’re silly, Freya.

 But I made the effort.
 “It’s not entirely my fault,” I huffed.
 And then I was sorry I’d said anything.
 I didn’t need to defend myself to her.
 “I know,” she said, “but it’s still fun.” I wondered if she did know.

He could not explain that he already had a minor sigil of healing.
 He simply smiled and said, “I am too excited to lie down and groan in pain!
 My mind races with the possibilities.
 Now that I am officially a knight, I want to bring my sworn men into the chamber and figure out what sigils I will choose.” At his words the men’s faces tightened and they looked at his supposed servants.
 Rodregas nodded his understanding.
 He also knew from his own ‘illustrious’ career as a guard that the others would follow the rules.
 They were not officers to be making judgments.
 “I know you don’t like my servants being a Hellborn and a Nymph,” he said keeping his voice light.
 “But they are my sworn men and I trust them; and it is my call.
 Now open the doors.” At the last part he let a sergeant’s voice ring out and it was more order than request.

I think later, they returned to Memphis and played the Coliseum in front of Tull,  and went down a lot better.
 Anyway, we started hearing this, you blew them off the stage and shit like that.

This initiative cannot be ordered, it can only be encouraged.
 Economic policy recommendations failed adequately to anticipate either the impact of the programme on the people or their reaction to it.
 In the early stages of reform, the public exhibited an incredible degree of patience, tolerance and endurance under conditions of growing hardship.
 Gradually public resentment and personal suffering (especially for the aged, children and new entrants to the work force) became so severe in some countries that no government could have sustained the programme without facing political upheaval or violent revolution.
 There is some truth in the argument that ‘shock therapy’ did not fail in Russia and other countries, because it was never actually implemented.
 At each crucial juncture either the central bank or the government pulled back from enforcing the necessary fiscal discipline.
 But it is equally true that ‘shock therapy’ never could have been implemented by a democratic government, when it imposed such enormous hardship on the people and generated a polarization and fragmentation of political forces within the country.
 Where similar strategies have succeeded in other parts of the world, it has usually been under authoritarian governments, such as in Chile.
 Where force is not possible, the only viable alternative is to build social consensus in support of the reform strategy.
 Ultimately, the success of the reform measures will be determined by one factor – the extent to which the people understand, accept and are motivated to act under the new system.

 the reform measures are mainly economic measures that will help to deal with corporate and senior pressures on individuals and sectors, so they can be effective, attractive, and thus support spending. No country defaults into a financial clearing deficit and no society or culture will ever so softly resupport the programme. If

 Several minutes later, once the renewed bout of coughing had subsided, Mallory looked back up at me with wan features.

 "It was my fault.

Combined with my other duties, I am stationed in the castle almost all week.
 The magic practice exhausts me or I would sneak out at night, the way I enjoyed as a child.
 It doesn’t seem fair.
 My sister is practically ignored.
 Father clearly prefers me, but sometimes I wonder if that is really better.
 She wanders idly around the castle, no practice, no duties, no formal gatherings.
 Magic practice, castles, who was this girl?
 I read the entries for hours.
 Ruby must have thought I was sleeping.

Dropping the bottle onto the bed, she went back to Rick's room calling, "Is the pizza here yet?"
 "Not yet," he replied as he emerged from the bathroom, still toweling his hair dry.

 Drops of water sparkled on his shoulders, and his skin glowed from the recent scrubbing.

I was a little hungry, but the pangs were a distant kind of discomfort.
 The real suffering for not eating wouldn't come into play until we hit the tutoring lab.
 Oh well, when I got home ravenous and ate a decent-sized meal Mom would probably be ecstatic.

 Normally I would have just acquiesced, but I couldn't bear the thought of letting him leave, taking with him the identity of the only person besides my mom who really cared what happened to me.

 Sometime during the night Mom had put our message board up on the fridge.

 See you tonight after school.

 They only needed to close the distance and Qurrah was theirs.
 However, knowing was easier than doing.

It is an indication that the phase of society’s predominant dependence on government initiatives for development is coming to a close.
 An organization combining the advantages of SHGs and contract farming through the agency of an NGO or an agri-business centre operated by farm and home science graduates or entrepreneurs can be successfully extended to other crops, providing the technical knowledge and essential inputs that small farmers need to raise productivity and farm incomes.
 Crop Diversification: Eradicating hunger necessitates shifting production from traditional crops to higher value added crops that can improve nutrition, while generating higher on-farm incomes and greater off-farm employment.
 Fruits and vegetables can remove micro-nutrient deficiencies, while dairy and poultry can eliminate protein deficiencies.
 The soaring price of petroleum, which has reached historical highs this year, presents an additional opportunity for countries such as India to become large scale producers and exporters of bio-fuels and bio-mass energy, thereby substituting imported petroleum with lucrative markets, higher incomes and greater employment opportunities for the rural population.
 Contract farming arrangements between small producers and agri-business centres can stimulate rapid development of this field.
 Ethanol, bio-diesel and bio-mass power from agricultural produce could generate the equivalent of 15 million additional employment opportunities in India, while raising rural incomes by US $10 billion annually.
 Water Conservation: Improving access to safe drinking water requires a combination of public education and government action.
 In addition, the rapid depletion of water resources can be mitigated to a large extent by upgrading practices in agriculture, which is the single largest consumer of water.
 Productivity of water in agriculture remains extremely low in most developing countries.

 After those attempts failed, she gave us ten dollars and a shopping list.

 I watched Chevelle, still walking casually toward us, as if there weren’t two angry panthers preparing to pounce on him.
 But I must have appeared about as threatening as a kitten, because the leg I was gripping shook with laughter.

In the absence of legal channels of protest, opposition parties have frequently resorted to violence.
 By the end of the 1980s the lack of material progress and the emergence of young educated professionals in leadership positions had fostered, on the one hand, a revolt against single-party rule and, on the other, popular pressure for multi-party democracy that have together resulted in a democratic domino effect, similar to the spread of communist rule which Western democracies had feared would overwhelm South Asia twenty years ago.
 As recently as 1989, only four African countries could be considered stable democracies and three more were moving in that direction.
 Only three years later, 18 African nations could be classified as democratic and a number of others were in the midst of far-reaching political change.
 The peaceful end of apartheid in South Africa is one remarkable outcome of this process.
 There are even winds of change in the Middle East, where Jordan has recently shown the way by conducting free elections.
 The role of democracy in development would be even more compelling were it not for the apparently contradictory evidence posed by the recent experience of Russia and China.
 Russia hastened to introduce democratic reforms in the hope that they would lead to rapid economic advancement.
 China preferred to postpone political reforms until the economic transition was much further advanced.
 As an immediate result, China has the highest economic and employment growth rates among the nations of the world, while Russia has experienced three successive years of steeply declining national income.

 Soviet Union completed their four greatest revolutions in the world they no longer affected very little change over the next 10 years and the economy will continue to bear a series of not encouraging signs.

Rising anxiety over prospects for employment in the 1990s posed a serious threat to global trade negotiations and to the prospects for growth in the developing world.
 Examination of the rising problem of unemployment in industrial nations led us to the formulation of a comprehensive strategy for full employment in the West.
 The Commission's fourth plenary meeting in Oslo during September 1992 focused on the issues of employment and transition.
 Our effort to examine each of these problems, both in depth and in relation to each other, was aided by the constitution of six working groups to study a wide gamut of issues related to peace, disarmament, food, employment and human development in the emerging global context.
 This report is based upon the findings and recommendations of these groups, which were presented and discussed during the fifth and final plenary meeting at the Carter Presidential Center in Atlanta in October 1993.
 This narrative of ICPF's brief history illustrates the complex array of interrelationships that link the issues of peace, social stability, disarmament, democracy and environment with economic transition in the East, employment in the West and poverty elimination and population stabilization in developing countries.
 The necessity for understanding and addressing these issues as a complex whole rather than as disparate and independent parts has been an underlying principle of our work.
 From the outset, it has been our intention to build upon the work of previous international commissions that have done so much to generate greater public awareness and support for coordinated global action.
 This report contains specific operational strategies for implementing many of their recommendations.
 Much of their work can come to fruition in the changed international climate, if only we shift the emphasis from preoccupation with cataloguing the problems to focusing on the opportunities available to eliminate them.

 we set aside the borders and between destinations, we may draw the powers of all trade actors together to create the ever greater body that the emerging global context is from which direct solutions can be determined.<eop> Strengthening elements in creating tangible results prevent others from allowing suggestion.<eop><eod> The better part of my

So, you are a lot more sensitive to the power that the books have.
 But what separates Grimoires from other books is that they are made like the stone walls of these buildings, by Nymphs.
 It is thought that the original reason was simply to have books that would not rot over a period of centuries, but the nymph-created paper and leather can hold a faint imprint of magic.
 “Each time that the sorcerers cast a spell from the book, it lightly engraved the pattern into the paige.
 A mage can sense the previous patterns in the book.
 The ability of such books to show the pattern of the spell means that even a mage who knows a spell by heart can cast it faster by using such a book.
 It also means that such books are much sought after and never given up freely.
 Grimoires are nearly never sold, unless the owner dies.” She paused to make sure they were both following her and then continued, “While the Grimoires are a great tool for quick and accurate casting of a spell, it is even more potentially useful for someone trying to learn magic.
 Reading a regular book with the spell written down and trying to keep all the symbols and shapes just right in your head even as you fill the complex shape with power requires years to learn.
 But a powerful Grimoire can quickly show you the shape and help you learn new spells in weeks, instead of years.

After experiencing such intense, barely restrained violence, I was starting to see just how ludicrous that'd been.
 People had already died over what was going on here.
 It hadn't been real, either because I hadn't examined Simon and Nathanial's lifeless bodies, or maybe because I was repressing the experience like I'd done with so many other parts of my life lately.
 I could feel my mind trying to shut down, hoping to cushion me from the worst implications of what was coming.
 I knew it was going to be bad, could feel it in a sickening, only-seconds-away-from-vomiting kind of way, but couldn't follow the chain of logic through to the very end.
 I let Jasmin help me pull my books together, and then numbly followed her out to the hallway.
 Alec and the rest of the pack were waiting for us at my locker.
 Jasmin calmly opened my locker and put my things away while I was still trying to come to terms with everything.
 Alec took my hand.
 "Are you okay?"

 Relenting, she picked up a small piece with the tips of her thumb and forefinger.
 Rick ate it slowly, closing his eyes.
 "That's the best bite of sweet and sour chicken I've ever had."
 Chuckling, she took another piece and fed it to him.
 "This really is messy."
 Rick grabbed her wrist when she started to reach for a napkin.
 He leaned forward, taking her forefinger into his mouth and licking off the sweet and sour sauce.
 Heat flooded Marie's body.
 She watched, helpless, as Rick continued to suck on her finger, his tongue caressing it.

But, no Paladin of the Gods had ever come to their rescue.
 The truth was that even if one of the gods was backing Rodregas, it was more likely to be some god who was pissed off at the Immortalists; one looking for a chosen champion for their own selfish reasons.
 As a child Rodregas had dreamed of being such a champion, but Paladin’s were always chosen from the ranks of the Order of the Soaring Heavens, and while Rodregas had once served the Order as a squire he had never came close to achieving knighthood.
 “All right, Sir Paladin, I have to admit I have talked to the Sorcerer Ravenhurr a few too many times, and you definitely don’t seem to be him.
 Nevertheless, we are taking your wagon and your supplies.
 We will let you go in peace in the morning,” said Audrian in that tone of voice that implied that he just expected people to follow his orders.
 “Hand over the shorts swords,” Audrian continued, gesturing at the two blades that Rodregas had yet to pull.
 “We will return one in the morning.” Rodregas smiled and nodded and pulled the two swords out simultaneously.
 He was starting to think his new body was ambidextrous, equally comfortable with both hands.
 That could prove useful, but would require some additional training to take full advantage of.

"And-and it feels as good as--as good as kissing?"
 "Better.

 She grew warm imagining a pleasure greater than what he'd made her feel a few minutes ago.
 "I wish--"  She stopped, swallowing and closing her eyes.
 "You wish what?"
 When she didn't respond, he tilted her chin up, making her look into his eyes.

He spoke too quietly for me to make out exactly what was being said.
 It seemed like he was giving orders though, and that they weren't being received very well.
 A few minutes later Alec bundled me into the back seat of an unfamiliar car, which rapidly filled up as first Jasmin, Isaac and the tiny Hispanic girl arrived.
 Jasmin completely ignored me as she climbed into the car; Isaac gave me a polite, if somewhat cool nod.
 The Hispanic girl gave me an honest-to-goodness smile as she slipped behind the steering wheel and started the engine.
 In what was one of the most thoughtful things that'd happened all night, she turned the heater on full as she pulled out of the driveway.
 The drive into town, and then back out to my house was quiet, but luckily didn't take as long as normal.
 Apparently her timidness stopped well short of observing the speed limit.
 Alec, Isaac, and Jasmin all jumped out of the car as soon as my house was in sight.
 The car was still doing at least twenty miles per hour when they bailed.

She understood his allusion, and although she wasn't ignorant of what the marriage bed involved, she had no firsthand experience at all.
 And Davis wasn't some adolescent boy trying to touch what he shouldn't; he was her Prince Charming, and he'd all but proposed marriage to her.
 Daringly she entwined her fingers with his and raised her eyes to smile into his.
 The evening was magic.
 Marie and Davis had dinner alone at the Locke-Ober Café, Boston's most exclusive restaurant, and then he took her dancing at a private club where she'd never been.
 It overlooked the Charles River, and when they left the club, they strolled along the river.
 It was a warm, clear April evening, a night right out of a romance novel.

 On the evening of Valentine’s Day, 1963, I stopped by his house and he showed me a sack half full of small candy hearts, with slogans like, “I love you” and “Hey, sweetheart.” He picked out a half dozen that asked, “Why not?” and gave me the rest of the bag, along with instructions for tomorrow at school.
 He said, “Give one to every girl who looks like she didn’t get a valentine.” I passed some around, though not half as many as Eric would have done.

She told them she needed to leave.
 At first they didn’t believe her.
 Then they cried.
 By now, she had been gone three years.
 Over that time, she attended several churches and felt compelled to tell her story, since God wants his people to share our burdens with one another.
 At two churches she was informally but firmly shunned.
 The third church she was asked to leave.
 Though she didn’t explain, I suppose her expulsion resulted from her theory about evil being inside us all or from the fear she would infect the congregation with notions that could lead to an epidemic of broken marriages.
 At the end of her story, Curly comes over and gives her friend some reasons they need to move along.

 She loved seeing Tom again.

He was sure that originally that there had had doors covering the entrance, but of course, they were long gone.
 Rodregas smelled what he would find well before he came around the corner.
 Next to the entrance was the corpse of a large bear which had recently been killed and partly eaten.
 It had been a magnificent creature, the largest of the local black bears that he had ever seen.
 Rodregas realized that it had been a Dire beast, drawn here by the safe magical energies.
 Next to the dead bear were the two Dire Cats.
 Rodregas had gone around the corner thinking they were in the cellar, but instead found himself no more than twenty feet from them.
 He froze; the two cats seemed to be expecting him.
 They both watched him with steady eyes.
 One reached out with a huge paw and dragged the dead bear’s body closer.

She had her brown hair woven into a tight braid and wore well fitting chain and leather armor.

 It was battered and not looking good.
 The top of its handle was loose.
 His sword was possibly worse with chips and a crack starting high up.
 As the two circled each other, Rodregas’ realized that his first impression, that she was of the blood was clearly true.

 She was also highly skilled, and while not as physically gifted as Rodregas, she was powerful.

In the summer, he would spend entire days at the club, soon becoming a great golfer and playing four years on his high school team.
 He also learned what I call “accidental etiquette” which was my pet phrase for his learning great manners around adults as he golfed with them.
 A kind of “wax-on wax-off” —Karate Kid—subliminal learning, similar to how I learned to fight.
 Some of my fondest memories are of the days I got to watch him golf competitively.
 Such a fine young man and a great sport; win or lose, he shows class and dignity.
 Brandon eventually lost his interest in youth sports and had no interest in golf.
 He did, however, love hot rods.
 He was intrigued by my high school hot rod so we found the same make, model and year of car in horrible condition.
 The only positive comment Lisa could make was, “at least it runs.” I taught both of my boys to drive a stick shift on this beat up Chevelle before my eldest and I began to take it completely apart in an attempt to restore this classic car to its original condition with a hot rod twist.

It was still so amazing someone like Brandon had asked me to go to a dance that half the time I forgot all about it.
 The other half of the time I had a hard time believing it'd really happened.
 But it had, and there were more than four dozen roses scattered around our kitchen to prove it.
 Predictably, Brandon didn't do anything halfway.
 I'd gone to school on Tuesday after receiving his amazing, 'anonymous' gift the day before, only to be ambushed at lunch.
 I'd been anxiously waiting for him at his normal table when a pair of employees from the local florist had walked in, their arms overflowing with roses.
 I'd been expecting them to stop in front of Jasmin.
 Instead they'd passed her up and then declined to make a beeline to Cassie either.
 When they'd started handing the flowers to me, I'd tried to convince them there'd been some kind of mistake.
 The sound of 'One Day More' playing on the cell phone nestled in the closest bouquet had been what finally convinced me it was all meant for me.

Another usher, this one thankfully no more fawning than the first, pointed me towards my seat, and I felt my second surge of disappointment for the night.
 My seat was on the main level, but it was only three rows from the very top, and all the way off to one side.
 I guess it really wasn't that surprising.
 If the school was paying for the tickets I should just be glad I hadn't been stuck with a standing room only spot.
 Still, as disappointing as it was that the performers were only barely going to be visible, it wasn't as bad as the nagging worry that Rachel wasn't coming after all.
 We'd spent almost every second together talking about how much fun we were going to have seeing Les Misérables together.
 She'd even still been excited about the bus ride.
 Given everything she'd said, I'd anxiously waited for her to show up at the departure point.
 It'd seemed impossible, but as Mrs. Alexander had gently herded me onto the bus, there'd still been no sign of her.

Something about the gouges was tickling the back of my mind.
 Had I seen something like that before?
 Hiking maybe?
 Only I could count the number of hikes I'd actually participated in on one hand.
 Surely something like that would've stayed with me.
 Someone gasped as the crowd shifted around, distracting me from my half-formed suspicions.
 I looked over at the exterior wall of the school and felt my jaw drop.
 Maybe Mom had read the story about the three little pigs a few too many times to me when I was growing up, but I'd always thought of brick as the strongest possible building material.
 I didn't have any idea if it really was, but it seemed incredible that anything could've wreaked such damage.
 The bricks on the wall next to the door were cracked and set back in the wall, almost like they'd been hit with some kind of wrecking ball, and the concrete of the sidewalk had gouges crisscrossing its surface like some kind of abstract painting.

 figured that out because I'd been showing a video of the children at a Beverly Hills run that had passed for school. Running along the Way in Massachusetts, I'd noticed we put them in a mile loop every two months for a year taking fixes and repairs. It wasn't so steep

Rodregas painfully climbed back up on Doom Hoof and circled the horse back to Doi’van for a new lance and shield.
 Doi’van handed over the equipment and said, “How did you break a shield on a single joust?” Rodregas grunted a non-committal response, and tried to find a comfortable position to hold his lance.
 “This is our last shield so when it is gone, we are done,” Doi’van said.
 Rodregas nodded in response, he had to get right back to the tilt, as it was still his turn to fight.
 Rodregas’ opponent was waiting for his return and was off full speed as soon as the flag fell.
 Doom Hoof was barely into a trot before the new opponent came into range.
 Rodregas knew he could not hit straight up against the more heavily armored and mounted opponent.
 So he dropped away from his opponent’s side with speed that his opponent could not match and then stood up in his stirrups and swung his lance into the man.
 That move was similar to one of the moves Doi’van had taught him with the quarterstaff.
 A normal lancer did not have the strength to use the heavy lance in such a way.

"Of course I knew.
 It isn't like I could do anything about that.
 I've never led her on, but I've always been aware she liked me."
 There didn't seem to be much else to be said, so I thanked Brandon again for the ride into school, and headed off to my home room.
 Everyone had pretty much just pretended like I didn't exist before.
 Now, with Brandon having taken an interest in me, I got everything from simple acknowledgment of my presence to obvious dislike, and even a couple of people who looked like they wanted to take Britney's place.
 I suppose some people would have been thrilled by the chance to join the top of the social food chain, but it mostly just disgusted me.
 I politely rebuffed the scavengers, ignored the haters, and carefully acknowledged the rest without giving them anything else to go on.
 It was a rather depressing exercise.
 By the time Mrs. Sorenson had fired a couple of ridiculously obscure questions at me, I found the good feelings I'd managed to carry away from the mayor's visit the night before had pretty much evaporated.

As I rose back to find my next target, I saw the wolves.
 They were also not being attacked, fighting with no opposition.
 And then I remembered what Chevelle had said.
 They would not kill the animals.
 As I laughed, the hawk screeched, and Chevelle and Steed glanced up at the sound.
 They were fighting, almost back to back, the bodies of councilmen strewn around them.
 I surveyed the land, searching for a stronger animal to jump to, something more harmful.

 Evidently the fight had cleared the mountain.

The boar approached a ridge of rock and turned, giving the human the advantage.
 He leaped after it, blade held wide, and landed, slicing into its side and twisting the blade back out.
 He was leaning over its small motionless body, heaving for breath, covered in blood.
 I laughed, shocked at myself, but filled with excitement and amusement.
 He stood, whirling to face me, bloody blade held out.
 I had to stifle another laugh.
 I managed to keep my reaction calm, only a smile.
 He seemed disoriented for a moment and then his breathing slowed and his arms relaxed.
 He stared at me as if I were a delusion, a dream looking back at him.
 He was speechless and it occurred to me that perhaps elves were not a part of this human’s knowledge.

But under circumstances in which underlying economic, social and political conditions are undergoing radical change, the relevance and predictive capacity of purely economic concepts is quite limited.
 This was the situation confronting the states of the region at the beginning of the transition period, and the reason why the actual results of the reform differed so drastically from what had been anticipated.
 The situation in Eastern and Central Europe was further complicated by the disproportionately large size and importance of the defence sector in the economy.
 This necessitates, not only a change from one economic system to another, but also a restructuring of the entire economy from a defence orientation to a consumer orientation.
 This change in structure could not be brought about by reliance on macro-economic policy.
 2.Political and social consensus is essential for rapid social change: In a democratic society, the market cannot be instituted by decrees or authoritarian methods which belong to the old sys tem.
 In the new political climate, reforms will be successful only in the measure that they are understood and accepted by the population.
 The vitality of the market depends on releasing the initiative of people to act in their own perceived best interests by producing and distributing goods and services for consumption by others.
 This initiative cannot be ordered, it can only be encouraged.
 Economic policy recommendations failed adequately to anticipate either the impact of the programme on the people or their reaction to it.

 recommendations of the IEA were successful in the case of weapons sale, comprehensive investment was precisely in the nature of the present war industry. It did not want to invest. 3.Indiscipline lacks grounds for satisfaction: The reform programmes did not try to understand their material implications, and the public's

Ravenhurr had a suit of Mithril chain; he could feel his heart start to beat in excitement.
 Mithril, a rare magical metal that was stronger than steel but much less heavy and made one of the best light armors.
 AElves, who are not physically as strong as other people, loved the metal.
 Rodregas held it up to himself and then, as excited as he had become, his heart sank as he realized that the suit was both too short and much too slim for him to wear.
 While there were straps to adjust it, his new body was very large and he would never wear the beautiful armor.
 He threw the armor on the bed.
 It might not work for him to wear, but he could get a good amount of money selling such fancy armor.
 It was the first item of real worth that he had found.
 On a shelf above it was another small pile of the silver chain.
 When he pulled it up he saw that it was a helmet, a solid Mithril skullcap with sides of chain mail designed to be connected at the bottom.

Not in the respectful ‘a lady entered the room’ way, but in a way that led me to believe he wasn’t happy to have me, or anyone, find him there.
 He held a long staff, gripped so tightly his knuckles whitened, and he was dressed in casual traveling clothes that didn’t seem to fit his posture.
 I found myself questioning whether it were a disguise, and then I chastised myself for wandering around in ridiculous thoughts so often.
 They were watching me.
 Cursed brain fog.
 I stood there for a moment, unsure if I should leave the room after I had so obviously interrupted or pretend I had a mission and make my way to Ruby’s room.
 I clearly wasn’t welcome there.
 Neither spoke, so I lowered my gaze to the floor, taking the shortest route to Ruby’s door and closing it hastily behind me.
 Chevelle spoke to his guest and I groaned internally, wishing I’d heard their low voices earlier.

"And thereby the full effect of the Earth's curse was felt.
 Trapped as they were in their beast forms, neither brother could talk to the other, and the resulting confrontation quickly spun out of control.
 Hours later Adjam was left bleeding and broken as his brother disappeared into the night."
 Alec's soothing voice continued on, but I'd lost the ability to listen.
 My mind floated off into visions of a battered wolf who dragged himself over to a brook before collapsing on the bank, streaked with mud.
 Just before the blackness carried me completely away, a willowy girl appeared from behind a thicket of trees and timidly approached the bleeding figure.
 Chapter 30 The cool night air dimpled my skin despite the warmth of Alec's chest.
 We'd been walking for quite a while before I came fully awake.
 Dominic and Jasmin had shaken me awake, and then helped me out of my dress and into jeans and a white shirt.
 Donovan had been waiting in the hall just outside Alec's room.

I opened my mouth to say as much, but my vocal chords wouldn't cooperate.
 I was still trying to verbalize my feelings, when his free hand came down to my chin and gently pulled it up.
 My heart stuttered and threatened to quit as his lips slowly came down to meet mine.
 My only other experience had been so terrible that I nearly panicked, but before I could formulate a protest, or even decide if a protest was what I wanted, our flesh touched.
 The contact immediately drove every other thought from my mind.
 His lips were the perfect combination of firm and soft, and the heart that'd been all but stopped a second before sped up to heart attack rates, slamming itself against my chest in an effort to get closer to him.
 All of my senses were blending together.
 I couldn't tell if he smelled incredible, tasted like heaven, or if it was all just a side effect of the energy which had gone from tingling to crackling as soon as our faces touched.
 My inhibitions, the ones that'd always kept me from acting on the occasional amorous impulse, evaporated sometime in the first half second, and I found myself with both arms wrapped around his neck, clinging to him with all my strength.
 Later I'd probably claim it was to steady myself against the wave of dizziness, but right now I knew it was because I wanted him more than anything I'd ever experienced.

 The following night, Harruq slipped out into the street.
 Lamps were lit here and there, casting shadows across the road.
 Harruq stayed far from Celed, the elven side of town, since they sent all their children to be raised in Nellassar, deep in the heart of the Erze forest.
 It was the human children, especially the poor and the destitute, that Harruq sought.
 Of course, none would be out playing, not with so many dead and missing.

 I was anxious to see the finished work.
 I waited impatiently for her to raise her head again and hoped whatever it was wasn’t permanent.
 She finally glanced up at me, smiling an easy smile.
 I looked nervously at my wrist.
 It was magnificent.
 A simple outline of a bird with outstretched wings marked the delicate skin at the base of my palm.
 Unbelievably tiny runes surrounded the bottom of its wings, making a pattern appear.
 I smiled as I praised her.
 “It’s beautiful.” One eyebrow shot up and she jumped from the bed, grabbing my wrist and pulling me with her.

“And what are you five named?” Rodregas asked.
 There was a pause at his question.
 He knew this was an important moment because once people say who they are they are much less likely to do violence.
 Rodregas did not understand the reason, but he knew that to be true.
 “I am Imeralda,” said the AElf maiden.
 Then came the Hellborn, “My name is Doi’vanaomeraldioan, but humans usually call me Doi’van,” he stated in a slow careful way in a very deep, deep voice.
 The leader, after a pause, said, “I am Audrian of family Corin.” The other two men identified themselves as Brit and Geor.
 Geor, the one with the torch, was blond and like the other men, unusually good looking and well built.
 Brit said little and was of dark hair and light skin.
 Offhand, Rodregas thought he looked to have come from the northern Kingdoms.

He trailed behind the others and watched them shoot.
 There were five shots that you had to make: a man shaped target at twenty paces, a crouching man shape at thirty, a standard round target in a hay bail at forty, and another round target at fifty paces and finally there was a round target dragged in hops and jumps across the field with a rope pulled by squires.
 As the first round of contestants lined up behind the rope to shoot, Rodregas watched the technique of the better archers and mentally went through Imeralda’s advice.
 She was all about breathing; she claimed that keeping your eyes where you wanted the arrow to go and releasing the string at two-thirds of the way through your exhale was the best way to hit your target.
 Rodregas became nervous as he waited.
 He was very impressed by the quality of the archery on display.
 Clearly everyone knew what they were about.
 He ended up being behind a tall young man.
 Rodregas almost thought he might have some AElf blood.
 It also looked like he might have a broken nose from the previous day’s competition.

No one said anything and Emily produced a pencil out of her bag.
 “I need a piece of paper, Jazell.” I ripped one out of my notebook and handed it to her.
 We sat at the table and Emily titled the page: Warnings.
 I didn’t know why.
 “Okay, Jazell, what exactly did he say?” Emily asked, pencil poised in the air ready to write.
 “He said, ‘He’s rising, he’s rising’.
 I have no idea who he meant or if what he said means anything.” Emily scribbled down, Toad dwarf said, “He’s rising, he’s rising”.

 Instead, he turned and joined his brother.

How even at their worst, those friends hadn't collapsed at the mention of their departed loved ones.
 My pulse was already almost twice as fast as normal, and the room was just starting to wobble from side to side.
 Rachel was saying something, but I couldn't really hear her.
 The void was gaping below me, when something grabbed my shoulder and shook me surprisingly hard.
 I opened my eyes to see Rachel looking at me.
 "I'm sorry I had to do that, Adriana, but you need to hear what I have to say."
 Half of me wanted to be angry, but the other half just wanted to collapse into the void.
 Force of habit won over anger and I passively let my defenses crumble, but apparently being shocked out of a collapse functioned much the same as having just come out of an attack.
 For the next few seconds at least I was safe, could think about anything I wanted without fear of the repercussions.
 Only Rachel was talking, ruining my concentration, so the only thing I could focus on was her words.

Alec was usually so careful to keep me sheltered from his world.
 "Was Jasmin dominant then?
 I mean if she was a royal wolf and you hadn't manifested your hybrid form yet did she win all of the fights?"
 Alec rested his cheek on the top of my head.
 "Not exactly.
 If she'd been a little more heartless she probably could have killed me and cowed the rest of the pack.
 Even then though, it was becoming pretty clear that we couldn't have two separate packs in such close proximity.
 The need to keep the pack strong meant that even though she pretty much ran the show most of the time there was the occasional thing that I'd just refuse to back down on."
 His muscles tightened unconsciously, like maybe he was remembering past pains.

It wasn’t long before we came up on a wide creek.
 I assumed Steed had control of my horse; I was simply concentrating on staying in the saddle as we ran beside him.
 The horses edged closer to the creek, splashing along the muddy bank and then the shallows of the water.
 Silt and cold water sprayed my face as we ran.
 I wondered if this was what it felt like to fly like the fairies.
 We followed the creek until it turned west and we kept north, slowing to a walk.
 I tried to catch my breath.
 Steed was watching me, smiling appreciatively, and I realized I was wearing a huge grin.
 And about three pounds of mud.
 The slower pace gave me time to take everything in.

We killed her.” It sounded so matter-of-fact, my head bobbing along with the words.
 I couldn’t seem to stop.
 My mouth opened to speak once more but I was suddenly swept up, off Steed’s lap and into Chevelle’s arms.
 I managed fear for half a second but then lost the feeling to dizziness, followed quickly by only dull numbness.
 Chevelle was laying me on my bed.
 “Stay here.
 It will pass.” His words were gentle now, the anger gone.
 “I’m sorry,” I whispered.
 He didn’t respond.
 He leaned over me to straighten the bedding, his face close to mine.

 Eric vs. Max Von Sydow
 Back on the road my thoughts pick up where they left off in San Luis Obispo, and I wonder if Brother Lawrence perceived his constant companion as the Father, the Son, or the Holy Spirit.
 Maybe my problem with adoring God is my habit of looking at, or for, God the Father, who in my vocabulary is easy to respect, admire, stand in awe of, or even worship, but is hard for me to adore.
 God, to me, looks more like a vapor.
 And his whispering voice either sounds too much like my own to be surely authentic, or else it’s so soft, I’m not often sure I heard right.
 The Jesus I used to picture looked like a young Max Von Sydow in The Greatest Story Ever Told, and his expressions appeared more posed or acted than honestly human.
 But now he's beginning to look more like Eric.

He was soaring.
 He was making music, Memphis music, as sacred a calling as one could imagine.
 Eventually, Buddy found his grounding, a group almost as flexuous and capable as Buddy, though few could approach Buddy’s genius for the ineffable, that secret other place he could go with his music.
 Black Lung was born in the mid-sixties in an abandoned gas station when a bass player named Crafty Connor was introduced to Buddy through the coagulant Sid Selvidge.
 Memphis music bred Memphis music, is how Sid describes it today.
 Crafty, who had a face like moits in wool, attended East High where he had picked up the bass guitar (and put down his flugel horn much to his parents’ disfavor) when he first heard Jack Bruce play.
 He wanted to be part of a power trio.
 He wanted to be part of the best power trio Memphis could build and he wanted to build it.
 He called Sid who said, “Well, you could do a lot worse than hooking up with this young guitar kraken, Buddy Gardner.”  Crafty called Buddy.
 Buddy called Skippy Quetzalcoatl, who had a drumming lineage like no one else’s.

His good blanket was missing, as was his spare pair of boots and most of his other belongings.
 Clearly, the rest of the guards had thought him dead and made free with his stuff.
 Rodregas reached into the trunk but all that was left in there were a few bits of trash, a few candle stubs, some scraps of paper and a bit of cloth.
 He reached down and picked up the small piece of cloth and held it up.
 He stared for some time at the design sewn into it, and then stuck it into his outer purse.
 He had a strong urge to clean up his bunk and leave the area in the order it deserved, but that would be too big of a hint of what had happened.
 So, he was careful to leave it as it was; the longer they thought he was Ravenhurr the better.
 He then walked past the rest of the wooden cots of the barracks to the back where the captain’s room was.
 The captain’s room, unlike the outer barracks, was spotless and in perfect order.
 He searched through the captain’s pair of trunks and found some clothes that fit him, though tightly.

"You'll wait for me tomorrow?"
 "I don't know--maybe.
 Anyone that thinks Minnesota is the east instead of the Midwest can't really be relied upon to remember important things like appointments."
 I could feel myself blushing again as I pulled free and fled into the house with a single wave goodbye.
 Normally I wasn't flirtatious.
 Heck, I hardly knew the meaning of the word, but something about Brandon turned it all into a harmless game.
 A game with rules that were nearly comprehensible for a change.
 One where there was very little to lose and an undreamed-of potential for achieving amazing things.
 As soon as the door was shut I ran to the window and hid behind the blinds, watching as the black Mustang drove up our lane.
 Overcome by the sudden urge to giggle, I ran upstairs looking for my mom.

 No problem, I had none. I was not the bully to just knock you out of your pants!" "Ellie," I cried out, thrusting at a knock that echoed into the back of my head! I could see her excitedly with the hands she held folded wide

Again the short, reluctant nod.
 I had so many questions I still wanted answered, but it didn't seem fair to get Isaac in any more trouble than he was already in.
 "Will you be okay?

 He's not going to torture you or anything for telling me, is he?"
 Isaac's smile somehow completed his face.
 Funny how I'd never thought there was anything wrong with it before, but after finally being rewarded with something more than his normal, serious countenance, I had the first hint why he was one of Rachel's favorites among the pack.
 "It's likely I'll be exceedingly sore for the next few days, and my ego, such as it is, will likely take quite the beating, but our Kir'shan, our Alpha as you would say, isn't a bad sort."
 That was a relief.
 It also meant I knew exactly what I was going to do when I saw Alec next.

 I mean I was just trying to do something nice for you, but if you're going to be like that, we'll leave it here."
 Her grin didn't engender trust, but when I opened my mouth to call her on it, she forestalled me with an upraised hand.
 "I swear.
 We'll go home and leave the dress here."
 The pout came back out for a moment.
 "But, if you're not going to let me buy this for you, I'm going to need to compensate by buying something for Jasmin."

Rodregas’ next opponent was shining in the sun in his steel; which was better than him having to face Night Bronze plate, but still not very reassuring.
 The flag fell and Rodregas dug his heals into Doom Hoof’s side and the mount plodded forward.
 His opponent’s horse looked almost as powerful, but much faster.
 The collision happened before Rodregas was fully expecting it and he felt himself hit the ground and hit it hard.
 “Great,” Rodregas muttered to himself, “He has a Dire Steed and full plate armor.” Rodregas rolled over and pushed himself up, Doom Hoof stood nosing the sand looking for food.
 “The damned beast should be pulling plows not in a tournament for knighthood.” Rodregas thought.
 Rodregas’ opponent was starting to turn around, probably to ask for his surrender.
 Rodregas painfully climbed back up on Doom Hoof and circled the horse back to Doi’van for a new lance and shield.
 Doi’van handed over the equipment and said, “How did you break a shield on a single joust?” Rodregas grunted a non-committal response, and tried to find a comfortable position to hold his lance.
 “This is our last shield so when it is gone, we are done,” Doi’van said.

Service in activities designed to improve education, health and the environment can be of immense benefit to the country, while slowing the pace of new entrants to the workforce.
 The United States recently established AmeriCorps to strengthen and expand service and educational opportunities by providing educational grants to youth in exchange for community service in the fields of education, environment, human services and public safety.
 Participants receive a limited wage while serving, plus a post-service educational award for higher education.
 15.Pay the unemployed to work, rather than not work: The high costs of welfare programmes, the negative incentives they provide to job seekers and the harmful psychological consequences of unemployment can be mitigated by modifying welfare programmes to require that the able-bodied unemployed either train or work in exchange for welfare payments.
 The type of work given may be varied depending on both the qualifications and the training needs of the individual – for example, as assistants in child education, or care for children and the elderly, or environmental protection.
 If properly administered, these programme have proved successful in reducing costs, imparting new skills and identifying false welfare claims.
 Redirect welfare expenses for creating jobs, rather than encouraging idleness, by paying welfare recipients to carry out public service activities in return for welfare payments.
 This requires the identification of employment-intensive programmes that provide clear benefit to the community without interfering with existing business, such as the US Civilian Conservation Corps that built the US National Parks system in the 1930s.
 Expanding or upgrading the educational system would be a priority area.
 16.Make income distribution more equitable: The number of jobs available is directly related to patterns of income distribution.

 across areas of poverty, it is difficult to arrange households to afford additional labor. Single couples and father look after a child, possibly performing, independently, community activities such as free music, or providing basic meals; occasionally, nights off should be dedicated to raising children and doing other relevant community activities.

The growth of food production in developing countries can be accelerated dramatically by the application of resource-based, location-specific strategies that incorporate a proper blending of traditional and frontier technologies and integrate all the links in the chain of production, processing, transport and distribution.
 Conditions vary too widely from country to country for detailed recommendations to be broadly applied.
 However, a number of strategies are relevant to the majority of developing countries.
 Some of the components of an Action Plan designed to achieve this goal are given below.
 1.Elimination of agricultural trade barriers by industrial nations.
 The agreements reached for liberalizing agricultural trade in the Uruguay Round of GATT are an important step forward, but they will not release the full dynamism of the agricultural sector, which is so critical for more rapid growth of incomes and employment in both developing and developed countries.
 In the previous chapter, we have called for rapid reduction leading to a complete elimination of agricultural subsidies and other trade barriers by industrial nations, which can generate a positive multiplier effect.
 It has been estimated that complete liberalization of trade in agricultural commodities would yield an annual gain (in 1992 dollars) of about $25 billion for OECD countries and $22 billion for developing and formerly centrally planned countries.
 Actual gains could be very much higher.
 These subsidies cost Western consumers several hundred billion dollars annually.

 agricultural exports. These barriers protect prices of agricultural products roughly analogous to agricultural peers. To fill in the value stock gaps, agriculture is partially dominated by bueno-name concessions. Taking into and, through increased improvements to the soil and agriculture ecosystem, barriers on the trade in agricultural commodities costs around $50

The extreme disruption of the centrally planned economies of Eastern Europe during the early stages of their transition to market economies has led to high domestic unemployment in most cases.
 Slow recovery from the recent global recession has restrained the growth of foreign trade.
 Down-sizing by major corporations in response to intense competitive pressures has eliminated many jobs which are not being restored, even after the recession is over.
 Privatization and restructuring of public sector companies in response to fiscal pressures has had a similar effect.
 In the United Kingdom alone, an estimated 500,000 jobs will be lost for this reason in 1994.
 The impact of structural adjustments programmes has slowed economic growth and new job creation in a number of developing countries.
 Gains in productivity due to new technology, particularly delayed gains from the micro-computer revolution of the 1980s and the growth of factory automation, have slowed job growth in some industries.
 The increasing competitiveness of the NIEs of Asia and most recently China has displaced jobs in the West, primarily unskilled jobs.
 The major impact of several of these factors has already been felt and is now beginning to subside.
 Some will continue for several more years.

 little, an increase in unemployment in western European has further undermined perceptions there are strongly better employment growth rates in East Asia. Together, the west of this region will provide approximately a quarter to 800 million jobs a year and will make up about 40 percent of GDP in the core of that region. All economic

A tiny figure barely recognizable as Rachel, was walking towards a dark-blue bullet bike, which had just roared to life.
 We had to walk several more steps before I recognized the leather-clad, dark-haired figure on the bike as Alec.
 My feet must have unconsciously slowed because Britney was now several steps ahead of me and looking back impatiently.
 I tried to catch up, but Alec chose that moment to look up and stare in our direction.
 He was quite a ways away, and his lovely eyes were covered by a pair of sunglasses, but I somehow knew he was looking at me.
 He handed Rachel a helmet but continued to look at us, at me, while she put it on.
 I was moving again, but my pulse sped up as Rachel grabbed a hold of her brother and swung her leg over the pillion seat on the bike.
 She seemed to see us for the first time as a cold chill arced down my back and the horizon started to vibrate.
 I managed to raise my hand in response to her wave, but it was an absent motion.
 My attention was still on Alec and his unwavering stare.

The two continued staring, each wishing to speak their mind but unable to summon the courage.
 “You are a wise man,” Dieredon said, breaking the moment.
 “You know who is in the right in this conflict, as do I.”
 “Yes, we both do,” Antonil agreed.
 He glanced to the elf, his face asking the question he could not voice.
 “No, I will not fight at their side,” Dieredon answered.
 “Never could I raise my bladed bow against you.
 However, I cannot fight against my brethren.
 I will let fate decide tomorrow, without my involvement.”
 Antonil clasped the man on the shoulder.

It was “I Can’t Get Started” by Bunny Berigan.
 I don’t know.
 I can still play that one.
 CM:  	So, you grew up in a musical house?
 Music was part of your everyday life?
 BG:  	(laughs) Shit, no.
 Why would that follow?
 I mean, we had this console thing, whatever the hell they called them, big as a basilisk, a monstrous thing that had a radio and record player.
 I used to lie on the couch in the dark and listen to FM 100 on that thing—my parents, well, if they thought about what I was doing at all, probably thought it was better than TV.
 Better than My Mother the Car, or whatever.

 that means I went to that musical house that was was used to the gathering around that six-liter glass, probably so loud it’s 40. I just went back upstairs to play to FM 100 on that. Gaisin’ nice. The story didn’t end for me until about 30 years

That’s parenting.
 Chapter 13: Fatherhood 101 I had always promised myself I would do everything to be the father I never had.
 Sometimes you learn what to do from your experiences, and sometimes you learn what not to do.
 I had learned a lot of what not to do.
 My experience with my stepfather Dino was a nightmare itself, and then Richard wound up being real trouble.
 My mother had tried to warn me, but I wanted and needed to know for myself.
 My mom’s warnings could not deter me as I was a teenager and we all know teenagers are smarter than everyone else.
 I have a theory about teenagers; basically they could be walking off a cliff towards a canyon and you could yell and scream warnings all you want but your time would be better spent packing them a lunch so they could eat it on the way down.
 Numerous attempts to let Richard in our lives always ended in disaster.
 I know it is natural to want to know who your father is.

A thick woven jacket was shielding me from the October cold.
 When I looked back at Seth, I realized he had also made an outfit change.
 He was wearing black leather boots and dark blue pants.
 His top was a short, brown cloak with a hood and leather belt.
 A beautiful steel sword with an ornamental hilt was swinging at his side from a woven sheath.
 “Oh well, I guess I have green hair.
 It’s not that bad.
 I like green.” I rambled as I examined the short hunting knife that was resting in a small sheath on my hip.
 I ran a finger over the blade before putting it back.
 How Seth and I had acquired such dangerous weapons was anyone’s guess.

“His spirit will be bound to mine,” Qurrah said, sitting on his knees before the body.
 His eyes were closed and his hands atop Ahrqur’s head.
 “Any question you or I ask he must answer truthfully.

 Spirits brought back into our world rarely enjoy the journey.”
 Harruq nodded, dressed in his black armor.

His smile was surprisingly reassuring.
 "That sounds like the easiest one I've asked you yet.
 Why the sudden bashfulness?"
 My throat seemed to be spending an awful lot of the time lately constricted down to the point where speech was all but impossible.
 It was even worse than usual now.
 I thought maybe he'd have moved on to something else by the time I was able to talk again, but he was still patiently waiting when I managed to make myself look up again.
 It was tempting to lie and tell him I was just thinking about Cindi, the only one in the family who'd ever really had any luck in the dating department, but that wasn't fair.
 Besides, it would only put off the dreaded day.
 Eventually he'd find out what I was really like.

As Adjam, the elder of the brothers, descended from the heavens and touched down upon the Earth, he collapsed to the ground in pain.
 Despite his agony as the very bones of his body rearranged themselves, he managed to call out a warning to Inock, to flee back to the Moon.
 The love of Inock for Adjam was so great that he rushed to his brother's side, where he too fell victim to the Earth's plague."
 I wanted so very badly to remain awake, but wrapped comfortably in the warmth of Alec's arms, I couldn't fight off exhaustion any longer, and I felt myself drift off into dreams of two brothers who survived the plague, rising from the ground after seven days, one a wolf, the other a jaguar.
 Chapter 24 I'd been awake for several minutes before I finally remembered where I was.
 I rolled over, opened my eyes, groaning when I saw that the other side of the bed was empty.
 Who knew what Alec thought.
 He'd obviously fled his own room to avoid talking to me when I finally woke up.
 Donovan's gentle knock and appearance at the door pulled me up short before I could really get going on the self-loathing.
 "Good morning Mistress Paige, I hope you slept well."

 this guy thought I needed it. Weird!<eop> When I woke up, my gut felt deep, so good. "This was great," Alec told me. A massive hug that I used to need all my life "deep in your heart, my God!" I told said

The lances shattered into shards when slammed against it.
 The ball of magma halted when touching the barrier and then reversed direction.
 The elf glared, detonating the attack with a thought.
 Molten rock covered the street, splattering across both Velixar’s and Aurelia’s shields before sliding to the dirt.
 “How long can you keep this up?” the necromancer asked.
 He took out a bag of bones and scattered more than thirty pieces.
 “How long before you break?”
 One by one, the bone pieces shot straight at Aurelia.
 The elf dropped to one knee, words of magic streaming out her mouth as fast as she could speak them.
 Her magical shield could halt attacks of pure magical essence, such as the conjured fire, but animated objects were a different matter.

Political states may still be able to survive wars, but developmental achievements can not.
 So long as the benefits of development are confined to one or a few sections of society, the costs of militarization and war may not prevent economic and social progress.
 But when the need is to fulfil the rising expectations of the masses by extending the benefits of development to the entire society – thus enabling the society as a whole to move to the next higher level of collective affluence and fulfilment – every social resource must be garnered and harnessed for this purpose.
 The colossal cost of armaments and the catastrophic destruction of war are incompatible with the achievement of prosperity for all.
 Peace has become the fundamental imperative for development.
 War as an Instrument of Policy
 Humanity has lived with war for so many millennia that it is difficult to imagine a world without it.
 Even in the four decades of ‘peace’ following the Second World War, approximately 160 inter-state and intra-state wars, including 100 major conflicts, have been fought in developing countries, leading directly to 20 million deaths – half of them caused by the armed forces of developed countries in Korea, Indochina, Algeria and other anti-colonial wars – and to another 20 million war-related casualties.
 These massive casualties during a time of ‘peace’ are roughly equal to the total casualties incurred by all the countries of the world during the last world war.
 An equally disturbing phenomenon has been the expansion of violence within society for political purposes.

 fight for “life” is much like American news stories, and with shots balanced in broad daylight falling down alongside noise, plod killings pose fear to young people. Conversely, as the social pressure of warfare has increased, political conventions elevated, and the tension generated by local conflicts have increased significantly,

Between 1960 and 1992, total employment in OECD countries rose by 110 million jobs or 44 per cent, including a 22 per cent increase in the participation of women in the workforce.
 During this same period, un employment rose by 23 million persons, representing a 259 per cent increase in the overall unemployment rate.
 More people are working than ever before, yet at the same time more people are unemployed, because a larger proportion of the population seek jobs.
 Growing anxiety about employment prospects in the West were aggravated by a sudden 50 per cent increase in unemployment after 1990, which displaced an additional 10 million workers in the OECD and was equalled only by the previous high of 1983.
 This increase is now showing signs of reversal.
 These average figures disguise significant differences in performance of countries within the OECD.
 Since 1950, Japan’s employment rate has risen from 43 per cent to around 50 per cent, while unemployment has remained in the 1 to 3 per cent range.
 The overall proportion of the population employed in the European Community has declined by 1 per cent since 1965 and is presently just under 41 per cent, but the percentage of the working age population employed has remained more or less constant over the past three decades, at 67 per cent, whereas in other OECD regions it has risen significantly – to exceed 75 per cent in North America, Scandinavia and Japan.
 Europe’s lower labour participation rate is attributable to a number of factors.
 A far higher percentage of the European workforce was engaged in agriculture 25 years ago and has since shifted to non-agricultural sectors, an adjustment that occurred in the United States during earlier decades.

 the higher proportion of labour participation in European countries entail, in part through comparisons, an imbalance among the modern United States and East Germany in addressal areas of economy. Germany and India and Russia are less competitive than most countries abroad and have lower minimum wage response rates than in many previous years.<eop><eod>

That song stems from a conversation we were having about the past, about the future.

 “Right on Poplar Avenue,” pun intended, is about this girlfriend I use to have—well, she wasn’t really a girlfriend, I guess—she was one of those people you come up against in your life where you’re just beating your head against a wall.
 For whatever reason you just aren’t connecting.
 This woman, beautiful woman, was a flirt, no kidding, I mean, she made eyes at me across this restaurant, this vegetarian restaurant, and I couldn’t figure out what she was doing.
 I was a little dense—this was, oh, I don’t know, before Lorelei, before we really hit big.
 And, then afterwards, one of those driving home epiphanies, I figured out who she was, and that she was looking at me because she recognized me and expected me to recognize her.
 So, I was a bit embarrassed and when I got home, I called her.

The Cathedral’s defenses gave it the reputation as one of the most impenetrable fortress in the Eastern Realms.
 Of course, Rodregas thought what could not be taken by force, could be easily taken by politics and fear.
 Once through both the huge gates, Rodregas, Doi’van and Imeralda came into full view of the Great Cathedral of the Heavens.
 The Cathedral served as both fortress and a temple to the Celestial Gods, and its thick walls were a balance of the practical and the artistic.
 Its towering white walls were adorned with statues and engravings.
 Above the ground floor were huge stained glass windows and arches and on the heights were a series of small towers and domes.
 Rodregas had forgotten how striking the building was and all three stood to admire it for a long moment before moving forward into the inner courtyard.
 In front of the Cathedral set a grandly engraved table of gleaming oak which looked to be more suitable for the dining hall of a noble than in the great courtyard.
 The three men behind the table were clearly Knight Captains of the Order; behind them stood young squires eager to be of service at the word of the knights.
 The knighthood was split into two grand divisions; those with minor sigils who were simply Knights of the Order, and Knights’ Captains, who had gained the greater sigils.

 knights paid themselves their respects in robes when sent to Arlingon. Rodreyros’ distinguishing characteristic was the man who instinctively steered the mule’s tractor in the outer armor as the strain, as time, increased. (UnThe man, who was the most tactically armoured

Otherwise they may recoil from the effort and look backwards to a failed system or be guided by false prophets on a path that once again poses a threat to other nations.
 The phenomenon of growing violence in an age of increasing affluence seems to contradict the thesis that poverty is one of the major causes of violence, until we realize that the increasingly visible signs of prosperity the world over raise the expectations and aggravate the sense of deprivation and revolt among those that have been by-passed by the general progress.
 Greater political and social freedom can only further magnify this tendency.
 This suggests that violence at the international, national and community levels cannot and will not be eradicated before poverty itself has been abolished, and that, if poverty is left unaddressed at its source, further economic progress is likely further to aggravate conflict in society, unless we are able to extend the benefits of progress to everyone.
 This realization would be quite disconcerting were it not for the fact that we are fast approaching the time when both these persistent ills of humankind can be banished forever – the way slavery and colonialism were banished in the past.
 The recognition that it is neither desirable nor possible to go backwards adds urgency to our efforts to move forward.
 Revolutions of the past have been partial and localized negative reactions against an existing social order, and benefited only a small part of society that, in turn, blindly resisted change.
 They resulted in war and usually much destruction.
 The revolution of rising expectations is a positive, constructive movement spreading to encompass people at all levels of all societies around the globe, and pressing for the establishment of a higher social organization that can meet the expectations of all humanity.
 But the energies liberated by this revolution have to be properly converted into an evolutionary effort for development, otherwise they will fly off in unwanted directions.

Not after everything else he'd already done for me.
 Guilting him into helping me more just felt wrong.
 He captured me in his iron grip, stopping me from getting up and running away.
 "Adriana Paige, it isn't that I don't want to be with you.
 I want it more than anything else right now.
 That's why I'm not sure it's such a good idea."
 His face had somehow gotten so close to mine that I could see his eyes, and they were dead serious.
 I'd never noticed how clear his eyes were.
 They were the purest blue I'd ever seen, and looking into them was like trying to plumb the depths of a bottomless spring.

 Far down the street, where the road hooked left like the back leg of a dog, an elven archer approached, his bow ready.

 Both half-orcs dodged as the arrows whistled past.

Donovan faced off against one of the first wolves, but it was obvious he was no match for the grace and power of his opponent.

 A month ago I would have thought that was a good thing, that it would be one less thing to remind me of Dad and Cindi.

 Mrs. Tranton nodded, finally meeting her daughter's eyes again.

He greeted Rodregas with a very bright smile.
 “I see that you are looking much better,” said the unknown Nymph.
 Imeralda gave the young Nymph a big hug, one that looked far more intimate than Rodregas was comfortable with and she said, “Rodregas, we are so lucky that I was able to get Jordaan to come.
 Durien was working so hard trying to heal you, but your body is so hard to work with.
 He says that the same innate magical ability that makes your body so strong also requires a lot of power to heal.
 Normally Durien can heal even a very seriously wounded person, but he could barely keep you and Doi’van alive.
 I had to leave and run to Fariste to get Jordaan to come.” She was smiling like the sun as she spoke.
 “He was so good to come and just leave at the last moment,” she added.
 Rodregas thought she was going to start hugging the Nymph again, but she caught herself and came over to him and gave him a careful hug and started fussing with his pillows.
 Rodregas wanted to pull her closer and inhale her scent.

In 1993 alone, consumer prices rose by more than 100 per cent in 15 countries, out of which 11 former republics of the USSR reported increases of more than 300 per cent.
 This was accompanied by a sharp rise in unemployment from extremely low historical levels prior to 1989 up to an average of 17 per cent in 1994.
 The tremendous physical and psychological stress experienced by people in the region as a result of the economic collapse is reflected in the sharp fall in birth rates and the steep rise in death rates.
 Since 1989, the birth rate has fallen by more than 20 per cent in Poland, 25 per cent in Bulgaria, 30 per cent in Estonia and Romania, 35 per cent in Russia and more than 60 per cent in Eastern Germany.
 Such abrupt changes have been observed previously in industrial societies only during times of war.
 Infant mortality is rising in many of the countries.
 Not surprisingly, there have been increasing indications of public discontent and voter dissatisfaction with the course of the reforms in the vast majority of countries.
 Simultaneous Shocks
 The collapse of the East European and Central Asian economies from 1990 to 1994 resulted from their exposure to a series of simultaneous shocks.
 1.Stabilization and adjustments: The majority of countries, having suffered from inflation and balance of payments problems in the 1980s, applied sharp stabilization and adjustment programmes in the early 1990s to stop inflation, balance budgets, and close balance of payments gaps, while at the same time liberalizing prices in order to correct major price distortions.

 Very New Trend. Exaf CF (2002) Helping Prices Soar: The values which are established by this new trend apply in of those which have been established in two or three countries in the 20th century between 1970 and 2003 with allocations deemed to be implemented with good intentions.

I encouraged their interests by making sure they had the equipment they needed to pursue them.
 For instance, when Brandon showed a real interest in and talent for photography, he received his dream camera for Christmas.
 I have loved my wife and I have shown my children that I love them.
 The boys have witnessed firsthand what a healthy spousal relationship is and that was something I never saw in my childhood home.
 I always believed in teaching my children to respect all people in all walks of life.
 On the holidays I sent my boys out to give freshly baked cookies to the people who collected our garbage.
 I taught the boys how to care for our yard, mowing and edging, and they had household responsibilities and chores (and I never sprayed them with a hose nozzle, at least not to compel yard work).
 I believed they needed to learn good strong work ethics.
 But I never once hit them, and I never abused them, as I had learned “what not to do” as a father.
 I did everything I could think of to give them the best chance to succeed in life.

The more productive and higher-paid industrial workers utilize their enhanced purchasing power to buy more goods and services than before – spending more on travel, consumer goods, housing, leisure, health and the education of offspring, and thus creating demand for more jobs in other industries.
 Rising incomes generate higher standards and expectations, bringing changes in lifestyle that create new needs and new commercial activities.
 This process has led to enormous growth in new jobs.
 The best documented example of this process is the automotive industry.
 Inspired by the idea of making a car the working-class masses at the turn of the century could afford, Henry Ford adopted new manufacturing technology, the automated assembly line, to produce the first low-priced automobile.
 Ford’s technology increased worker productivity more than seven-fold and reduced production costs by two-thirds.
 As an immediate result, thousands of small manufacturers of custom-built cars and horse-drawn carriages were put out of business.
 But the growing demand for low-cost vehicles generated explosive growth for the industry, creating tens of thousands of new jobs in the process.
 Globally, production rose from less than 250,000 vehicles in 1910 to 42 million in 1980.
 Nine decades later, the automotive industry is still the largest manufacturing industry in the world and the single largest source of jobs in the American economy.

 Considering that the American natural gas system made it into a major energy production industry, the industry is the only relatively new industry in the North American economy. As a future example, the automobile motor industry refers primarily to real estate in Prairie Lake, U.S.S.A.., Q.

I stepped out into the sun, and I had to steady myself on the stone ledge.
 Not because of the lightheadedness, though I was feeling faint, but because below me, before the steps to what I now realized was a castle, a thousand elves watched me.
 I sucked in a harsh breath, unable to get my mind to accept what I knew was happening.
 I had been so oblivious.
 Reading the diary, learning of my mother and her ties to the throne.
 It had told of my own life, of what I was to become, a reality that would not be put to rights in my broken mind.
 But as I stared down, the assembled pieces of my shattered self held together by no more than tattered bits of string, I understood.
 This was my place.
 I heard Ruby behind me now.
 In a low voice she said, “They have heard of your return.

Poor communications systems are incapable of handling the large volume of telephone, fax, telex and computerized messages needed for commercial linkages with other countries.
 10.Catalytic initiatives can release social dynamism: Social change is facilitated and accelerated by initiatives to introduce or demonstrate new patterns of activity and behaviour appropriate to the goals of the transition.
 One of the most successful initiatives of the Russian government in recent years has been the distribution of millions of small private agricultural plots to urban and rural households.
 Since a food shortage in the urban areas was the most pressing problem and greatest source of anxiety for the population, the government took steps to distribute more than 16 million small private plots to urban and rural families, so that highly vulnerable households could produce at least a portion of their own food requirements.
 These plots now account for more than 50 per cent of vegetable production and 80 per cent of potato and fruit production in Russia.
 Transitions require changes in behaviour and the private plots became an activity in which millions of people could participate in order to augment their own living standards and alleviate national food shortages.
 Similar catalytic efforts are needed in other fields to engage the population actively in new and improved activities.
 11.Reduce reliance on foreign aid: The prospect or lure of foreign aid has itself become an impediment to successful transition.
 In order to qualify for foreign assistance, these countries have overlooked the vast under-utilized resources available domestically, rejected the knowledge and advice of their own most experienced people in favour of foreign advice, sacrificed their most cherished social values, discarded even successful institutions and systems, and taken steps which, it was painfully obvious to many within these countries, could not possibly lead to the intended results under the prevalent conditions.
 In the 1950s, the Soviet Union managed to recover from the horrendous destruction it suffered during the Second World War and to embark on a period of rapid industrial growth without any external assistance.

 Alepsi: There have improved administrative and economic practices since the 1967s and a general trend has higher the number of rural areas. During the 1950s, rural conditions also improved. With a change of behaviour, those who put their conditions aside can find an opportunity to experience a new generation of productive

It flared again and Chevelle squeezed my hands; I had to be able to do this.
 I focused hard on the base of the flame as it wavered and then fell back toward the hem, where it finally choked off.
 I glanced up at Chevelle.
 He looked pleased.
 “Again,” he said as he stepped back and released my hands.
 The meadow seemed to open as a circle of fire grew in front of me.
 I tried to see past it, through the flames to Chevelle, and then it was gone.
 He was further back now, raising his right hand so a stream of fire followed it, arcing in my direction.
 I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to extinguish it before it hit me.
 My feet were frozen in place.

Seeking to distract myself from a thoroughly useless train of thought, I looked around, trying vainly to pierce the curtain of black hanging around the feeble circle of light.
 "Are they out there waiting now?"
 Alec shook his head.
 "No, I'd already have come and carried you away if any of Brandon's people were around.
 Barring that, you'd hear us fighting.
 Mere doors and windows wouldn't do much to muffle the sound."
 "You'd be fighting, because of me."
 Alec slowly crossed the distance between us, and took my shoulders in his hands.
 "Please don't try and take the blame for this.
 We've been on a collision course with Brandon's pack for years."

Anyway, I spent a good half-hour just looking around, while she stood aside and observed me.
 I was spellbound, pixilated.
 It was a ramshackle, poor man’s Kubla Kahn.
 I walked slowly around her little apartment, which was like some chthonic art gallery, lit by phosphorous.
 She had art reproductions by Klee, Gironella, Motherwell, Picabia, Bacon, this weird Malcolm Morley yellow pages thing, Ensor, on and on.
 Twombly.
 There was a mandala on the ceiling, a pentangle on the floor, what you could see, through the album covers and splayed paperbacks and drawings.
 It was strange stuff to me, eye-opening, shocking in a way.
 That shock that comes from knowing something is important but not knowing exactly why.
 And she had in between all these great prints, torn newspapers, headlines juxtaposed against this great art, you know?

She put her shoulders back, which caused her firm, rounded breast’s to thrust out.
 Rodregas didn’t think she meant the gesture to be sexual, but he hesitated at the sight of her superbly shaped body.
 Rodregas ignored his own rush of hormones and pushed her high on the shoulder and she stumbled back.
 “Now,” he said, “lower your center of gravity.
 Bend your legs, but keep them loose.” She followed his instructions, and he thought this would make her look less striking, but she went from a statuesque dancer to a crouching feline.
 He breathed in through his nose and tried to ignore his newly youthful hormones.
 This time when he pushed her shoulder she went back but did not stumble.

"Um, yeah.

 He handed me the bottle of water.
 "Well I hope you'll like it here."
 "Wait, what's this for?"
 The grin was back, and his teeth were still perfect.
 "I just made you spill yours, it's only fair."
 Brandon nodded at Britney, who stood there with her mouth slightly open, as he walked away.
 After a second or two of both of us staring blankly after Brandon, Britney grabbed me by the hand, the one holding the new, unopened water bottle, and pulled me over to a table in the corner.
 "Oh my gosh, you just poured water all over Brandon Worthingfield the Third.

That is why the AElves take so long to choose a life mate and almost never choose one outside of their race.
 They mate for life; not out of choice, but because that is required of their nature.” After Jordaan finished speaking he stood silently as Rodregas sat up in bed and thought on the healer’s words.
 “She is not as free with her body as most Nymphs,” he said.
 “No, she is not.
 She only lies with men who she truly feels a great respect for,” Jordaan answered.
 Rodregas had known that fact, but had not really thought about it.
 “So what you are saying is that Imeralda forms a life bond like a AElf.
 But while a normal AElf has only one she can form multiple bonds, and she has a bond with you and a bond with me?” he asked.
 “Yes, I know of few other cases like this.
 She will always know where you are.

 When she is need of someone else on the ground I can give her valuable physical access, if she wants me to better see where she is. But she will always be vulnerable to me—and your vulnerability.” Rodrega raised his eyebrows in shock about what the healer was talking about.<eop>

Brandon stood up from where he'd been leaning against the sports car and flashed me a blinding smile.
 He moved towards me with a casual grace that made little shivers run through me despite my earlier decision not to let his interest, or lack thereof, affect me.
 "I had a bet with myself that you weren't going to wait.
 Somehow the fact I just lost doesn't matter now."
 It didn't seem possible he was talking to me, that anyone so gorgeous could mean something like that about me.
 I opened my mouth, maybe to laugh the comment off, or otherwise hedge my bets against the humiliation and inevitable mocking laughter.
 Whatever it was I'd intended on saying evaporated away the instant he reached out and slowly slid his finger down the side of my face.
 The tiny part of me that was still screaming none of this could be real was pulled along by the rest of me.
 I completely abandoned myself to the sensations created by his touch.
 My nerve endings didn't know whether to classify his finger as icy cold or scorching hot, but before I could recoil in pain the sensation gave way to a tingly warmth that sank down into my center, simultaneously tightening and relaxing parts I didn't even know I had.

 in all I hadn't noticed anything in the entire 3 seconds since Brandon first leaned into me. After I knew when he was really going to do something I shifted to move towards him, did I even have a very short moving frame of time when he had about pretend to tell me he meant to

Does a minority group within a country have the right to proclaim itself independent on the basis of its desire for self-governance and in defiance of the claims of the majority on the property and resources they possess?
 Does a national government, whether elected or in power by force, that is unable to protect its citizens against famine and civil strife have the right to insist on its sovereignty and independent action in the face of the persecution or extermination of its own people?
 What is the responsibility of the international community for preventing or alleviating crises within societies?
 What should be the limits placed on international involvement in the internal affairs of countries that, at least momentarily, are unable to help themselves?
 The sanctity of the sovereign state, like the sanctity of private property in a capitalist society, is a fundamental principle of the nation state system on which the present world community is based.
 Like the protectors of private property, the guardians of the sovereign state vigorously resist each attempt to limit its scope or qualify its power – although in both instances there are obvious and well-recognized limits and qualifications.
 The sensitivity over the issue of sovereignty – especially among former colonies and victims of imperialist aggression – is quite understandable in view of the fact that the emergence of modern nation states over the last two centuries occurred during a period when imperialist wars and colonial conquests were accepted as part of the normal conduct of international relations.
 It is a measure of the world’s progress in this century that this standard of conduct is no longer tolerated by the international community.
 The formulation of current policy on racial memories of past exploitation or persecution is no more appropriate or conducive to human progress, however, than the false conception of policies based on an exaggerated sense of pride or egocentric self-importance derived from the glory of forceful conquest in the past.
 In both instances, attitudes of the past must give way to fresh attitudes oriented to the future.

 She snickered.

Pete proved to be a bad choice of a business partner, as his use of cocaine escalated to the point of total addiction.
 In less than a year he would snort everything he could get his hands on.
 He was stealing money from the checking account and drop-shipping inventory from our business directly to drug dealers to feed his habit.
 My own brother Thomas was one of the many drug dealers receiving this merchandise for pennies on the dollar in exchange for cocaine and marijuana.
 This would be one of the many actions that would drive a wedge between Thomas and me as drugs and money started to always come before family.
 It hurt me deeply to contemplate Thomas’s complete disregard for our relationship as brothers and his choice to take this merchandise from my addicted partner while knowing full well that it would financially destroy my business and thus me.
 Pete had already disappeared for several weeks when I discovered what he was doing, but it was too late and the business closed within a month after the invoices for all of these portable spas and waterbeds started arriving.
 The checking account had been completely drained of any operating capital.
 Bad business partner, and bad best friend: My girlfriend at the time, Karen, had hidden her drug habit from me, and by the time I discovered it she had emptied our joint savings account and was screwing my ex-partner/best friend, Pete.
 They were both very addicted to cocaine and I guess they belonged together because neither one of them belonged with me.

The house was quiet when I slipped from bed, trying not to make a sound.
 I peeked into the main room, finding Chevelle sitting against the front wall, a small window over his head.
 He leaned over, working on something in the palm of his hand, a steady scratching accompanying the movement of his wrist.
 I started forward and my boot scuffed the floor, alerting him to my presence.
 As he glanced up, he slid whatever he’d been working on into a pocket at his hip.
 It dawned on me then that the main room had only the entrance and two other doors.
 If we were staying with Ruby then the second room must be hers.
 I meant to offer Chevelle my room to sleep in, but the look on his face was so unnerving I could not stop myself from offering something else.

 Karen – Well, it seems like most people would paint what they think Heaven would look like, clouds and angels and harps and buildings that look like Greek Temples.
 People don’t usually touch on what it might feel like.
 That painting looks bright and warm, I like it.
 It also looks soft, it doesn’t hurt the eyes, not like that one over there.
 Art – That one does look violent, like a natural disaster, a volcano or something.
 Both beautiful and deadly.
 It’s really bright and painful with all those oranges and reds.

 looks like it’s a bit bumpy up here, but I like that doesn’t hurt, it’s beautiful and dangerous. And at the very same time, it gets reds, yellow, oranges, crassy orange, words, brown, blue, say,

The venom in such a massive dose poisoned him, so the story goes.
 I do believe in Karma (well, I do now!)
 and the world is a better place without this man, but I don’t know if I believe that story.
 However he died though, this man was in pain, and somehow that feels like vindication for my years of suffering at his hands.
 I felt horrible for my little brother Harry who was ten years old at the time, because they were so close.
 I also felt bad for his aging Father (my Greek grandpa) who was very ill, as this was his only son and his namesake.
 Dino’s funeral could be a book in itself.
 On the day of the funeral, we went from church to viewing to church to graveyard, always with another sermon or eulogy, with unbelievable crying and hysterics.
 I was in the family limo with my mother, my brothers and poor old Grandpa (Dino’s father).
 Before I got in the limousine a man walked up to me and introduced himself as Grandpa’s doctor.

 morning was long, and I was tired. I sometimes really like a lot of all the poor old ones, but today it wasn’t better. I really like a lot of poor old people who are in pain. As much as I cared, I felt their sufferings. Ritalin was in

I didn't want to make light of Rachel's hurt, or Jasmin's loneliness, but his presence was too great a temptation to pass up.
 My face started out in the hollow of his neck, drinking in the ambrosia of his scent, and then moved up towards his lips without conscious decision on my part.
 Our lips met, and it felt like a warm, pleasant surge of electricity washed from my head down to the tips of my toes.
 My head started spinning almost instantly, only my hand on his chest, and his arms around my waist kept me from losing my balance completely.
 As it was, I still fell into him, overcome by weakness as my heart stopped beating altogether.
 No more than a second or two of breathlessness could have possibly passed, but Alec pulled away, firmly holding me at arm's length.
 "You need to get some sleep.
 Regardless of how the fight turns out, you'll need to be well-rested."
 My best longing look didn't seem to be having any effect on him, so I finally nodded and relaxed back onto the bed.

 Eric would promise to pay for the window, and get himself and Kenny pardoned.

He remained quiet, hiding all emotion from his apprentice and even refusing to look at him.
 “This is the first time you have ever brought the dead back to life,” Velixar said.

 At once, the eight bowed to Qurrah.

 The Growth and Death of Buddy Gardner by Dana Illsire © 1975
 You know Buddy “Slipshod” Gardner from his later solo work, the early seventies stuff when he latched onto the singer/songwriter craze begun probably by Sweet Baby James.
 You know him for his albums “Rain and Other Distractions” or “I Was a Child When Smaller.”  But this is the story of headier days, days when the Overton Park Shell was a magical place, the later rainbow implied.
 When Buddy played lead guitar and sang for Black Lung, a blues rock band with a loyal Memphis following.
 The late Lee Baker, a guitar god himself then, said about Buddy, “He was the best of us.
 He was a seer, a prophet.
 That later acoustic stuff is crap, of course, but with Black Lung, Buddy was tapped into something other.” Back then, Black Lung played the Shell regularly, maybe opening for Johnny Winter, or teaming up with Mudboy and The Expanding Head Band for a mini-festival that would start at dusk and stumble into the early morning hours like a dreamer looking for paradise.

 the acoustic configuration continued, and in that direction Tune out of the black expedition so it could host a greater multi-port special on the easel. The Shell at Twitch Lake was where Buddy pioneered further and "inspired" jazz-- chom Leete.<eop><eod> Sharpe

“… who even left it with her?” It came together then, the feeling I’d had when I woke and placed it around my neck, the part of the dream I’d shaken off as I stood before the basin washing up, cleaning the blood from my hands, from the pendant.
 I wanted to explain, tell of what I’d seen in the dream, but it was foggy and I was too slow to pull it into thought.
 I was too late; they had already passed judgment on me.
 Harsh judgment.
 The deep voice boomed with finality.
 “… convicted of practicing dark magic…” The elder’s staff slammed against its wood base, echoing into the tumult of discord rising behind me.
 I reached out my hand to plead for mercy, to beg to be given a chance to explain, and he began to list my lineage for the records.
 I was flooded with fury at the injustice as I heard my mother’s name and my outstretched hand became a fist.
 The speaker’s voice cut off.
 He grabbed his throat as the other council leaders rushed to him.

The last tracker hadn’t given at broken bones, not even before the threat of certain death.
 I’d need something dreadful, a new tactic to convince him.
 A tiny snake sunning on a nearby rock caught my eye and I smiled.
 Some part of me knew what had happened before, had felt it.
 I could do it again.
 I slipped the tip of the sword down to the tracker’s leg, just above where his knee met the ground, and sliced his trousers up to the thigh to reveal bare skin.
 Drawing the snake close with magic, I took it in my hand, its thin green body writhing over my left palm, the sword grasped in my right.
 The prisoner watched me, almost smug.
 It was a small snake, its white belly confirming it was nonvenomous, its frame no thicker than my pinkie, but it would do.
 I slid the tip of the sword across the skin above the man’s knee, making a narrow incision.

 It is getting darker by the moment, but my eyes have adjusted and I can clearly see the cars that cross.
 I eliminate them as they drive past.
 I am looking for one of two cars I believe they will be driving.
 Will it be the red Dodge Charger or the white Lexus sedan or perhaps a complete surprise?
 One way or the next, they know where I am and what I am driving and exactly where I am parked.
 I have met Ashley, so she should have no problem identifying me.

Between 1980 and 1990, female primary school enrolment rose from 44 per cent to 47 per cent of total enrolment, although it actually declined in the Arab states and remained virtually unchanged in South Asia.
 Uneducated females represent a huge reservoir of untapped human potential that must be given every opportunity and full assistance to develop their innate capacities.
 This will call for accelerated efforts to establish crèche and child-care facilities, abolish child labour, and remove gender bias from text books and educational institutions.
 The cost of raising female educational levels up to that of males worldwide has been estimated at $2.5 billion, a small amount for an initiative that could have such wide-ranging benefits.
 Third, literacy must be complemented by techniracy, education that imparts basic technical information and skills to the population through a variety of teaching methods suited to the educational level of the recipients.
 Detailed recommendations are presented in the next section of this chapter.
 At the other end of the spectrum, comparable efforts must be made to raise scientific literacy, which is essential for the continued growth of technology, productivity and employment in modern society.
 The pervasive influence of science in society requires that we bridge the gap that presently divides the sciences and humanities and evolve an educational system in which science is no longer regarded as a specialized field of study.
 Fourth, radical changes are needed in the content of school curricula at all levels to make education relevant to the real needs of the students and the development of the country.
 The society whose system of education is integrated with the social aspirations of the country will develop most rapidly.

 it is common for parents not to recognize the value of higher education to the children until their age range narrows. The capacity, skills and competence of it is important to make education available for the children from the highest quality and support them in all aspects of social and cultural life. It is also crucial

He has no car so he walks about one mile back on the shoulder of the narrow country road in Werner Springs as he talks to us.
 You can hear the crunching sound of the road’s gravel beneath his feet and imagine the gait of his walk from the delay between the sounds.
 The need for material objects is no longer what he desires and either are the drugs he once craved.
 We are touched by his compassion, his love and his maturity.
 We look forward to his call nightly and when we hear sirens, we feel sorrow for the parents whose visions are what ours once were.
 Our entire family welcomes our son back and we all realize that no matter how helpless a situation like drug addiction seems we now know that there is help, professional help.
 Most importantly, there is hope where there is love and there is love where there is family.
 Within any family and throughout the generations there will be many moments that define you as a person.
 If you are a father or a mother now, there was a day when you were a son or a daughter.
 Perhaps one day you will become a grandparent.

I tell her I will drive right over and park by the Starbucks.
 I hang up with her and I state into my wire that we are moving to the Starbucks and to deal with it.
 My head set rings from my personal cell phone and the lead officer is a combination of irritated and understanding but he warns me to drive slowly and not to get too far in front of the van which will be coming in behind me.
 I am already backing up as he speaks to me.
 I am told to park against something, a wall or a spot in front of a store but not to park in the middle of the lot leaving all sides open.
 I notice the surveillance van coming up one of the isles as I pull onto the same path the Dodge Charger took which leads directly to the Starbucks.
 The van pulls in behind me at a comfortable distance.

It must have been a dream.
 I had fallen asleep looking at my mother’s pendant, trying to remember her, and somehow combined it with the disaster I had read of the northern clans.
 It was only a dream.
 Shaken, I sat up, struggling to collect myself.
 I reached up to remove the pendant from the hook and squeezed it tight in my fist.
 It felt good, like a connection, and I slid the leather chain over my head, pulling the pendant down to rest on my chest.
 It felt right there and I knew I should have been wearing it all along.
 As I let go, I realized I’d gotten blood on my hands, so I headed to the hall and poured water from the pitcher into a ceramic basin.
 Staring into the mirror was not my favorite pastime.

 He had to think quickly.
 It was instant death for anyone to interfere with an Immortalist Ascension ceremony.
 It was the most stringent rule enforced by the Guild of the Celestial Path, and therefore the most enforced rule in the Eastern Realm.

 I waited for Isaac to say something, but he seemed unwilling to give away anything I hadn't already figured out for myself.
 "Can he win?
 Alec, I mean.
 Can he ki...beat Brandon?"
 Isaac's sigh was eloquent.
 "I'm forbidden to speak on these things.
 To do so risks no small amount of Alec's displeasure."
 "But you're going to anyways, aren't you?"
 "It is right that you know the sacrifice undertaken on your behalf, both by Alec, and by the rest of our family.

 He really was very handsome, she mused, sinking deeper into the water.
 She'd been too preoccupied to really think much about it, but now she reflected on his lovely blue eyes, his perfect features, his smile.
 And he was so kind.
 Her own betrothed fled at even a hint of tears, but Rick had held her and stroked her hair.
 That was a highly improper action, of course, but then, this was a situation for which no etiquette had ever been designed.
 And besides, it had felt so good.

Some people hated me for using Brandon, others hated me for playing Alec, while a small, but decidedly upwardly-mobile group disliked me for achieving not just one, but both of the conquests they'd been dreaming of since grade school.
 In the end, it didn't really matter why everyone disliked me.
 Still, only the fact that Alec's pack closed ranks around me kept the situation from becoming unbearable.
 Biology went better than it had since my first day in Sanctuary, largely because Alec seemed to have developed a postdoctorate knowledge of Biology.
 Also he didn't have a single qualm when it came to using that knowledge to deflect questions aimed at me.
 Mrs. Sorenson tried three different times to make me look stupid before finally giving up and getting down to the business of teaching.
 She continued to shoot us nasty looks throughout the class, but I hardly noticed.
 Alec spent the rest of the class time writing questions for me in the margins of my notebook.
 By the time I'd described my grandparents, kindergarten teacher, and top three most embarrassing moments, I wanted to get a chance to ask some questions of my own, but he just shook his head and passed me my notebook back with a new set of quickly-jotted queries.
 The sentences should have been a careless mess based on the speed with which he was writing.

I was dumbfounded—he was like some shaman so I didn’t protest—and that hole in the amp is what gives my guitar such a weird sound on that cut.

 He stopped partway through shaking his head.
 "I can't promise he'll even bother to read it, but I'll take it to him if you promise never to talk about this again.
 I don't want to hear even the slightest rumor anything unusual happened in association with this project."
 I nodded, relieved I'd have a chance to jot down a couple of lines, that I'd at least have that much of a link with our protector.

And her skin was glistening with dampness.
 I thought I had stumbled into heaven, man.
 I thought, nothing is gonna be easier than falling into bed with this beautiful woman.
 So, after some awkward small talk—and keep in mind, she didn’t go get dressed—I made a move.
 I think I just sort of leaned in to kiss her.
 And she let me kiss her, but, man, nothing back.
 I mean, fuck, she didn’t even open her mouth.
 Don’t you hate that shit?
 So, I’m standing there, I might as well have had my dick out, and she looked at me like I was a piece of modern art that she couldn’t figure out.
 And, finally, after I had already turned back into an awkward 12 year old, she said, sorry, I can’t be doing that.

I was still humiliated to be there and to see my last name on the court docket clipboard.
 Easter weekend, Lisa, Bryce and I drove over eight hours drive towards Temecula, California, then over a rural road through a desert valley to Werner Springs.
 There was no mistaking our destination when we spotted it.
 It looked like the recreation yard in the film One Flew Over the Coo Coo’s Nest, as people milled about, stopping and turning to look at us as we entered the parking lot.
 The facility itself might have been a roadside migrant worker motel.
 People were roaming around the grounds doing everything from raking leaves to just hanging in groups, but each one stopped what they were doing to examine us as we drove in.
 We could immediately tell that visitors to this desolate location were rare.
 Brandon approached the vehicle with enthusiasm and the brightest broadest smile we have ever seen on his face.
 We instantly noticed his weight gain and he proudly announced through our open car window that he was nearing 170 pounds, and he looked healthy for the first time in so many years.
 His complexion was clear and his eyes were the bright blue they once were and the whites of his eyes were shinny and clear.

As long as I watched Mrs. Alexander I couldn't see Alec anymore.
 It seemed like I could still feel him though.
 The right side of my body hummed and tingled, almost imperceptibly, telling me he was there.
 I did my best to ignore the sensation, concentrating on the pictures rapidly forming on the ancient blackboard as Mrs. Alexander diagrammed the conceptual model of a wave, and started dissecting the various parts.
 Crest, trough, period, amplitude.
 None of it was hard to understand, not particularly interesting, but still a welcome distraction.
 After what seemed like an eternity, Mrs. Alexander placed the piece of chalk she was using behind her other ear and smiled at the class.
 "Okay, that's your introduction to light.
 Form up into your usual groups and take a project summary; you'll be working on this for the next few days."
 I joined the class in filing past the teacher's desk, and then watched as everyone started moving desks around.

The niños who crawled on the muddy bank had implausibly shiny hair and wide eyes of milk white and gleaming obsidian.

 Shaped like a Hershey bar, only high as mountains and made of chrome and glass.
 A thousand beams from the rising sun ricocheted in prisms off it.

A boyfriend, or near-boyfriend, was nice, but some things just needed to be shared with another female.
 I couldn't tell my mom about my feelings for Brandon or she'd absolutely freak.
 After spending so much time lying to her about the origin of the almost four dozen roses, I couldn't afford any kind of slip in that regard.
 She'd thought the single rose, Lagrimas del Angel, as I was calling it now, had been sweet and thoughtful, especially when I'd told her it was from an anonymous admirer.
 The other roses had been an entirely different matter.
 I'd had to do some pretty quick talking to convince her I didn't know who they were from either.
 All of which meant I still hadn't told her I'd been asked to the Ashure Day Dance.
 Luckily, Rachel was the perfect listener, even if she did cringe a little every time I mentioned Brandon.

My biological father is an alcoholic, refusing to acknowledge his addiction and destroying any chance of being part of my youth or my children’s (his grandchildren’s) lives.
 Watching drugs tear apart my family and kill my friends had sent me in the opposite direction as an adult, as a husband and as a father.
 Soon Lisa and I couldn’t ignore Brandon’s behavior.
 Hoping it would just go away or that he would grow out of it like I did didn’t seem likely.
 His grades were terrible, and he kept getting in trouble for being in the wrong place at the wrong time or with the wrong person.
 For instance, he was put on probation for being in a car with someone who was in possession of a replica firearm.
 He looked like total shit, and when we confronted him about it he was feeling bad enough that he confessed: He was addicted to the pain pill known as Oxy.
 He told us that he needed our help to get off of it.
 We never thought to find the reasoning behind the drug abuse, we just thought he had tried it and grew to feel dependent on it.
 He was always a tough kid to raise and he was often a handful and we felt this problem could be handled like any other.

Normally this energy would be consumed by the earth in burial, but Qurrah had other plans.

 Qurrah had a solution but it was far from pleasant.
 Most likely he would die, but he had to try.

As freedom has finally been recognized as an inalienable right of every human being, we are fast approaching the time when society must recognize and ensure the right of every individual to gainful employment.
 Given the right leadership and policies, ‘Jobs for All’ is an achievable goal for all industrial nations within a decade and for all of humankind early in the twenty-first century.
 A change of attitude is the prime necessity for this accomplishment.
 Global Survey
 A survey of unemployment in different regions of the world makes evident the reason for the mounting concern over this issue.
 Unemployment in the industrial countries is at its highest level since the Great Depression.
 The official figure is around 6.4 per cent in the United States, but the actual number, including those who have given up seeking jobs, is probably above 10 per cent.
 More than 35 million Americans, constituting 14 per cent of the population, are living on incomes below the poverty line, including 30 per cent of all blacks and Hispanics.
 Western European unemployment rates are at the highest level in 30 years.
 They are projected soon to reach 12 per cent or 18 million people and remain high throughout the decade, prompting the outgoing European Union President, Jacques Delors, to call employment Europe’s ‘Achilles heel’.
