‚ÄúClear your mind,‚Äù Velixar said to his apprentice.
 ‚ÄúLet the emptiness give you comfort.‚Äù
 The wind blew, swirling cold through his ragged clothes.
 Velixar watched his apprentice take several deep breaths.
 ‚ÄúFor this spell to work, you must have a significant idea in mind,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúMake it bleak and vile.
 If you are to darken someone‚Äôs dreams, your own mind must be just as dark.‚Äù
 Qurrah breathed out, his eyelids fluttering as a memory surfaced in his meditation.
 ‚ÄúSend the image to me, my apprentice.
 Let me have the anger, the darkness, and the despair.‚Äù

She stumbled a bit when I told her I hadn't enrolled in classes before moving.
 I didn't offer any additional information, so she tried to defuse the awkwardness by asking about electives.
 I answered numbly, picking out classes nearly at random.
 I already knew a school this size wouldn't have anything truly interesting.
 I'd never been willing to dedicate the time required to learn a musical instrument.
 I've always been passable at drawing scenery, but anything more complicated than a stick figure gives me fits, so art was out too.
 Unless possibly the teacher liked Neolithic cave drawings.
 By the time I surfaced from my musings, Mrs. Pendely had printed my schedule out on an ancient piece of machinery, handed me a map of the school and a locker assignment, and then dashed off a handwritten note to my first teacher.
 I somehow found my first class before the bell rang.
 Mrs. Sorenson, my biology teacher, was a skinny old woman with curly white hair that looked like Greek paintings of Medusa.

 Maybe I should give up writing.
 Or hand over Perelandra College to someone.
 Spend more time growing vegetables and cooking from scratch, like Brother Lawrence did.

She-- "Marie?"
 Her eyes flew open, and she looked up to see him standing by the sofa.
 "I-I was just trying to think of something to make for dinner."
 "Why don't we go out?"
 She shook her head.
 "I really don't feel like going out."
 Walking to him, she linked her arms around his neck.
 "I'm sorry, Rick."
 "For what?"
 "For not being able to accept your proposal."

Mom pulled the mirrors out of my hands as soon as I reached the larger bedroom, and nudged me towards the window.
 "Admit it, Adri, we didn't get sunsets like this very often in Minnesota."
 "Adriana," I corrected automatically, trying to avoid thinking about where my nickname had come from.
 The sunset was beautiful, just starting to turn the sky pink as a prelude to the glorious oranges that would no doubt follow.
 It was the kind of thing that Mom was always trying to capture with her camera, but which never seemed to turn out quite as good as the real thing.
 The sunset wasn't what captured my interest though, it was the greenery.
 Mom's room looked out to the west, the gorgeous side that reminded me of the place and people that would always be home.
 Mom carting me off to the middle of nowhere wasn't going to change that.
 There was a huge tree on the far edge of the yard.
 It was a species I didn't recognize, but it still called to me.

I felt myself tense up in worry, but he waved my worries away.
 "In answer to the core of your question, Jasmin thinks it's because I've finally gone over the edge, that in essence I've snapped due to the stress, and this, 'obsession,' as she terms it, is merely a novel way of committing suicide."
 My heart started racing again, but he wasn't done.
 "The other school of thought is that I'm more of a healer than anyone realized, and that I couldn't resist your obvious need."
 He'd lost me there.
 "Wait, what do you mean?"
 Alec paused for several seconds before answering.
 "You glow.
 All of the time.
 Until now we always thought someone had to be a shape shifter to do that."

 Harruq leaned his head on his fist and stared at the grass, growing increasingly uncomfortable.
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.
 Not too much to tell really.
 My brother and I grew up in Veldaren, and about three months ago the king kicked out all elves.

 It was hard to tell with Ruby.

 She helped me move onto the blankets, the dizziness improved but my muscles weak and drained.
 I asked, ‚ÄúWhy are we here?‚Äù She twisted her mouth to the side, considering her answer.
 ‚ÄúWe were in need of shelter after your‚Ä¶ episode.
 It was close enough to work.

‚ÄúWe did what we thought was right.
 You appeared to be an Immortalist Sorcerer and I have grown to hate the Immortalists.
 When it became clear that you were not, I stopped trying to kill you.‚Äù He paused at this, and then Rodregas could tell he made a decision.
 ‚ÄúYou have given me a sword, if a small one, and among my people that is a powerful gesture.
 I will not lie to you, I have left my old life behind and the last few years I have learned to truly hate the Immortalists.
 I travel with you only because the others were going to go back to their homes, and I have no home to go back to,‚Äù he seemed to finish, but then added, ‚ÄúLast night you pointed out that the forces of the Immortalists would be after you and you would fight them.
 And you also proved that you can fight.‚Äù Once again he paused.
 He was clearly a man that liked to think before he spoke.
 ‚ÄúI am simply using you as bait.
 When they come for you, I will kill them.

 But as I lingered there, I knew the cause.
 I was seeing from a horse.
 We were outside the stone walls of the fortress finding sparse greens to eat, which bored me even in a dream.
 I encouraged the horse to run and he responded immediately, taking flight down the mountainside.
 The rocks streaked past us as we ran faster and faster, the wind whipping his mane.

 "Oh, Rick, that's not true!"

 She laid her hands on his chest, leaning into him as she looked up at him.
 "I really did want to kiss you.
 I couldn't have gotten that look on my face if I hadn't wanted to kiss you."

He stepped in closer and attacked, swinging one sword in a slashing forward swing and following up with a backhanded half slash that flowed into a half block.
 Neither was meant to do anything but feel this opponent out.
 The guard swung to try to meet his sword with his own instead of going after him.
 His sword lacked the shine of the ‚Äútrue silver‚Äù of Mithril.
 Instead it had the cast of blue steel, an enchanted steel / Mithril alloy.
 It was as strong as Mithril, but had more weight to it and held a better edge.
 Rodregas backed up, not wanting to see the results of his sword matched against a blue steel sword, as it would likely result in his short sword becoming shorter.
 Rodregas then stepped forward, he had to be careful though, he was a good foot taller than his opponent.
 The guard‚Äôs long sword gave him better reach.
 Rodregas swung at him and retreated.

Flooded with adrenaline, he hurled Qurrah aside, desperate to break the contact between them.
 Qurrah‚Äôs thin body crumpled against the dirt.
 At the sight of it, Harruq felt his rage break loose.
 He slammed his fist into the orc‚Äôs stomach, followed by a brutal kick to the groin.
 Harruq rammed his elbows into the orc‚Äôs face, baring his teeth in a feral grin as he felt cartilage crunch.
 Staggering back, the orc dropped one of his swords and clutched his face.
 ‚ÄúHis sword,‚Äù Qurrah shouted loud as he could.
 ‚ÄúTake it, brother!‚Äù
 Harruq obeyed without thought.
 He dropped to his knees, grabbed the sword, and rolled forward.

 ‚ÄúKing Vaelor has long felt inferior to the kings of his past.

 Chuckling, she took another piece and fed it to him.
 "This really is messy."
 Rick grabbed her wrist when she started to reach for a napkin.
 He leaned forward, taking her forefinger into his mouth and licking off the sweet and sour sauce.
 Heat flooded Marie's body.
 She watched, helpless, as Rick continued to suck on her finger, his tongue caressing it.
 He raised his eyes to hers as he freed her finger.
 "Better?"
 She felt paralyzed.

In an essay on writing short stories, Andre Dubus advised that when we get stuck, instead of stopping or attempting to go forward, we should try going deeper.
 On this trip, I have attempted to deepen my understanding of the word ‚Äúadore.‚Äù Now I‚Äôm trying to do the same with some words in John‚Äôs admonition, because I feel my mind or the Spirit telling me that everything we need to know to live in goodness and beauty may be contained in those few lines.
 John tells us to ‚Äúbelieve in‚Äù the name of the Son.
 While at a glance this could be taken to mean we should simply believe that Jesus existed, it doesn‚Äôt.
 Because ‚Äúbelieve in‚Äù denotes more than credulity.
 ‚ÄúBelieve in‚Äù means to fully trust.
 And here we‚Äôre not called to believe in ‚ÄúHim‚Äù but to believe in His name.
 As ‚Äúname‚Äù in the Biblical context refers to character, John is calling us to fully trust in the character of Jesus Christ.
 When we believe in, fully trust certain people, if we have any sense, we will follow their example and not only take what advice they offer but actively seek every piece of wisdom we can wrest out of them.
 If I want to become a baseball star, I should look for a coach or mentor whose character and lessons I can believe in.

From what little I knew about Alec's pack, it wasn't uncommon for them to spend time together without the kind of chest-beating byplay that was so much a part of Brandon's group, but our lunch table was even more subdued than I'd expected.
 Faced with an almost complete lack of conversation, I didn't have the courage to ask some of the questions on my mind.
 It wasn't until I'd followed Isaac to my history class that I finally worked up the nerve to find out more of what was going on.
 Once the substitute had called roll, and then more or less turned the class loose for a 'group study session', I turned to Isaac and whispered my first question.
 "This fight between Alec and Brandon, it's for real?
 I mean they aren't just going to fight until first blood, are they?"
 Isaac's nod was hesitant, like he knew I was headed towards things he wasn't supposed to tell me.
 "I'm afraid the contest is quite serious, but still nothing for you to worry about."
 That didn't add up in the slightest.
 "I don't believe you.

Dieredon watched him, amazed just how young the man could still look in the moonlight.
 He was a year beyond forty, yet he commanded the entire Neldaren army.
 Publicly, he handled the weight wonderfully, but when prying eyes were gone, his all-too-human fear and doubt showed.
 When the man spoke again, his voice trembled.
 ‚ÄúI will not break my oaths.
 His Majesty asked I enforce his edict, and so I shall.‚Äù
 Dieredon nodded, the sparkle in his eyes fading.
 ‚ÄúI had hoped otherwise, but follow your oaths and your heart as you must.‚Äù
 The elf whistled.
 From the night sky came the sound of soft wing beats.

He disappeared long before I could commit him to my young memory.
 Chapter 4: The Sixties and the Single Mom I don‚Äôt remember many details of my early childhood.
 As much as I try, I cannot visualize my father, Richard, in any setting.
 I remember my mother, my brother, grandparents, babysitters, uncles, friends, and different events but I just can‚Äôt place my father anywhere.
 My parents divorced in the early sixties and my brother Thomas and I were very young.
 We took a train ride from Kansas to California; my mother told us we were on an adventure.
 We were far too young to comprehend divorce so there was no reason for her to explain.
 Our dogs, Ringo and Trixie, were caged in the back of the train, surrounded by luggage.
 To get to them, it required passing through a designated men‚Äôs area‚Äîoccupied by men only.
 My mother could not accompany us.

I opened my mouth, but just simply didn't know what to say.
 The horror of being trapped in a body that was riddled with old injuries was something thousands of people faced every day, but it seemed even more of a shame for someone who'd once been so vital and strong.
 Mallory's smile held only the faintest hint of regret.
 "No need to feel sorry for me.
 I've had a good run.
 A much better one than most of my friends did.
 If I haven't managed to accomplish what I was sent down to do in the course of almost a hundred and fifty years, then I've nobody to blame but myself."
 "Still, I'm sorry.
 You seem much too nice of a person to have had all of that happen to you."
 "Nonsense.

I know she hasn‚Äôt left because I just saw her run to the back of a Starbucks that I know well.
 She is nearly in tears and suddenly hangs up.
 I call the officer from my blue-tooth not knowing what is happening or what to do.
 I know they can hear me through the wire but I cannot hear them.
 Officer White tells me they have the male in custody as he was hiding the car in the apartment complex and he ran right into all of the marked police cars and attempted to run.
 The cops blocked him off with some unmarked cars that had been on him since his Dodge had slowed next to my truck.
 He tells me they are looking for the girl and ask me if I know anything about her whereabouts.
 I tell him where I last saw her and I add that her last call had an echo sound.
 I tell him that the back of that Starbucks is the bathroom so perhaps she is hiding in it.
 Other officers in the van hear my message as it is broadcast over my wire.

"No,¬†you¬†don't understand.
 This whole time I thought I was in love with Brandon, I didn't even know him.
 You did so much for us and didn't even hate me when I was so rude.
 I've been so stupid, please don't send me away."
 I was halfway to another attack before Alec finally put a finger to my lips and nodded.
 "Very well.
 I should send you away for your own protection, but I'm too selfish to do what's best for you.
 Maybe later I'll be able to do what's right, but not right now, not so soon."
 Chapter 22 Rachel met us at the door with a shy smile that let me know any hard feelings would evaporate instantly if I wanted to be friends again.
 Alec put me down with a slight start as soon as he saw his sister.

‚ÄúOver the centuries, I have gathered many items to aid those who would swear their lives to me,‚Äù Velixar said.
 The locks clicked open, the lid raised, and then he reached inside and pulled out two swords sheathed in gleaming obsidian.
 ‚ÄúThese swords were once wielded by Aerland Shen.
 He led the elves that aided Karak in the great war against Ashhur.
 When Celestia cursed his kind, they shared his curse.‚Äù Velixar smiled at Harruq, his eyes gleaming.
 ‚ÄúLong have I waited for someone to wield these blades.
 An elf crafted and used them in battle, an elf cursed into an orc.
 These swords can only be held by one who has the blood of both inside him.‚Äù Velixar held the hilts out to Harruq, who drew one from its sheath.
 The sword‚Äôs blade was deep black and wreathed in a soft red glow.
 He weaved it through the air, his mouth agape at the ease in which it glided.

He was reclined on the bench, his feet propped on a low table.
 He didn‚Äôt seem as excited as Ruby had been about our coming trip, so I asked him about it.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just riding the wind, Frey.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, so you don‚Äôt know where we‚Äôre going either?‚Äù He laughed.
 ‚ÄúNo, I know where we are going.
 It‚Äôs only that I don‚Äôt know where we‚Äôll end up.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what was going to happen either.
 I thought of the tracker and realized what a good distraction the book had been.
 ‚ÄúSteed?‚Äù ‚ÄúFrey?‚Äù I smiled but it fell away quickly.
 ‚ÄúHow will we get to council?
 I mean, how do we find them?‚Äù He wasn‚Äôt smiling anymore either.
 ‚ÄúWell, there‚Äôs a good chance they‚Äôll be looking for us.‚Äù Of course, and they would all come together.

He fell prone, still screaming his anger and fury.
 For five hundred years he had walked the land of Dezrel.
 All that time, all those killings, and this was how he would fail.
 ‚ÄúKarak!‚Äù he shouted, all his power fleeing him.
 His undead minions collapsed, their souls released.
 The gates to the abyss opened before his eyes, and he felt the pull on his soul.
 The dark fire already burned.
 He saw the face of his master, and the sick grin there horrified him.
 ‚ÄúI will not die!‚Äù he shrieked.
 ‚ÄúI will not die!‚Äù

I believed they needed to learn good strong work ethics.
 But I never once hit them, and I never abused them, as I had learned ‚Äúwhat not to do‚Äù as a father.
 I did everything I could think of to give them the best chance to succeed in life.
 I protected them from what I felt were bad influences, including, sadly, my brother, their Uncle Thomas, who had not been reformed in prison.
 He was an addict into horse racing.
 When my boys were in grammar school, our neighbor asked me who the man was who came to our home during the day while we were at work.
 He said that this guy, sometimes with another man, would enter our house through the garage with the keypad code.
 We knew nothing of this!
 The neighbor described the car, and the description matched Thomas‚Äôs car.
 I showed him a family photo and he identified Thomas as the guy.

As I started to open it, I knocked one of his bags over and went to pick it up.
 The flap was loose and a piece of familiar fabric hung out.
 I glanced over my shoulder to be sure Ruby wasn‚Äôt watching, and opened the bag to find the fabric-wrapped package she‚Äôd handed to Chevelle our first day here.
 The package he‚Äôd traded my stone for.
 I pulled the material back to reveal a leather-bound book.
 Afraid Ruby would catch me, I slid the book into my own pack and took it to my room.
 I‚Äôd already been in trouble for stealing one book but this was technically mine.
 It had been swapped for my ruby.
 I was careful anyway, pretending to lie down and placing the book where I could quickly cover it if I were caught.
 I ran my fingers over the dark leather cover, tracing the scripted V etched there.

I smiled at Rachel and then flipped open my math book.
 Everything went just like normal, and promptly at five I closed my binder and started stuffing books into my backpack.
 I looked up to find Rachel standing in front of my table.
 "Are you ready?
 James had to leave early, but don't worry, we've still got a ride home."
 I think I managed to keep the disappointment off of my face.
 Rachel at least didn't seem to notice.
 Somehow I'd lost track of the fact that it was a Wednesday, and Brandon therefore wouldn't be taking me home.
 "Great.
 Britney's been avoiding me like the plague.

He fell to the ground and Jason brushed himself off.
 ‚ÄúYou okay, Jazell?‚Äù he asked me and held out a hand.
 I took his hand and he pulled me up.
 ‚ÄúYup, I‚Äôm just peachy.‚Äù ‚ÄúAt least you can use sarcasm in a time like this,‚Äù he said and started to fight his way through the crowd.
 I followed him quickly.
 I had no desire to become separated again.
 ‚ÄúWhen can‚Äôt you use sarcasm?‚Äù I asked loudly.
 He didn‚Äôt reply to me because he had spotted Emily.
 She was slowly backing up with her palms out.
 Fire danced from her fingertips and twisted towards the troll and frost beast.

Sometimes I entered a Zen-like state where everything else in the world just dropped away.
 It was nice to know the accident hadn't changed that at least.
 My heart stuttered a little, but I wrenched my thoughts away from where they'd been headed, distracting myself by wondering where Mom was.
 She'd been a little flighty before, but now it wasn't uncommon for her to be gone for twenty-four hours at a stretch.
 In some ways it was hard not having her around, but in other ways it was a relief.
 Sometimes she reminded me too much of Dad and Cindi.
 A surge of guilt splashed around inside me at the thought, but it was a realization I'd made weeks ago.
 By now some of the sharper edges to the emotion had worn away.
 I shrugged, dropping my book and binder on the floor next to my bed.
 Dwelling on the guilt would just make me think about why I felt guilty in the first place.

The elders were frantic, which only frightened me more.
 I had never seen them agitated.
 This carried on for hours.
 My hair and clothing were drenched in sweat and I was near surrender.
 And then, with no more warning than when the first pains came, it was over.
 A small, sweet child was in my arms.
 I drew in ragged breaths as I cleaned her face.
 I wiped her eyes and they came open, an unbelievable shade of dark green, sparkling like emeralds.
 She was a beauty.
 I wasn‚Äôt aware the room had grown silent until I wiped her ears and heard my own gasp.

There's a man named Stephen Hawking--" "He's a very well-known scientist."
 "Then maybe what this article says could be helpful.
 But I can't understand it.
 It has all these strange words--wormholes, white dwarfs, odd things like that.
 I can't follow this at all."
 "Let me see it then."
 He reached for it and then handed her a book in return.
 "This book is a little older than the others.
 It's probably easier to follow."
 As he read the article, he understood why she'd found it so difficult.

Her 'woe is me, I don't understand what is happening act' had usually worked with Dad, and it'd always infuriated me.
 It had much the same effect now.
 "This isn't like me?
 To stand up for myself when I find out who my real friends are?
 Please, you don't even know me, and apparently I don't know you."
 Rachel shook her head in denial.
 "No, this isn't you.
 Is Brandon putting you up to this?
 He isn't what you think, you really shouldn't trust him."
 Now she'd gone too far.

But Mom, I even went to the lab.
 It sort of made sense though.
 If they'd been serious about acing the test, they'd have been here every night for the last two weeks instead of trying to cram a few more morsels of knowledge into their heads at the last minute.
 Mentally shrugging at the stupidity of it all, I pulled out my Spanish and studied my vocab for a few more minutes until Mrs. Campbell came by to wish me goodbye.
 "It looks like most everyone's gone again.
 The last few will probably leave in the next ten minutes."
 She dropped her voice to a conspiratorial whisper.
 "I actually prefer they do.
 That way when their parents phone in to complain about how poorly they did on the exam, I can point out that the lab was open for another hour, but they didn't bother to stick around for the extra help."
 It was a speech that made her sound like a grouchy old lady, but I was starting to know her well enough to take it in the proper context.

 I wasn‚Äôt even aware that she new some of those words.

At the same time, the scope of its activities has been enlarged to include limited forms of peace making as well ‚Äì disarming guerrillas, conducting elections and enforcing human rights.
 Article 42 of the UN Charter also empowers the Security Council to take direct military action where necessary to maintain or restore peace and guarantee international security.
 Article 43 pledges member states to make armed forces available to the Security Council, not only on an ad hoc basis but also as a permanent standing military force.
 This provision has never been activated due to the intervention of the Cold War.
 In the wake of the invasion of Kuwait, a proposal was placed before the UN General Assembly on behalf of a group of small and militarily weak nations seeking the protection of an international ‚Äòsecurity umbrella‚Äô against the threat of invasion by mercenary forces, terrorists, drug traffickers and warlike neighbours.
 The proposal was supported unanimously by the UN‚Äôs 166 member states.
 In Agenda for Peace, the UN Secretary General has recommended broadening the peace-making, peace-keeping and peace-enforcing capabilities of the UN by establishing a standing UN military force.
 With the end of bipolar confrontation within the Security Council, this proposal is practicable and should be acted upon immediately by establishing a strong permanent force drawn from 20 to 30 member states, trained and equipped for rapid deployment.
 Such a force, if established, is likely to be relatively small, however, and unequal to the task of dealing with threats from a major army equipped with sophisticated weapons.
 In addition, its deployment would always be subject to veto by any of the five permanent members of the Council.

I felt something boil deep within me-the anger at him.
 We were his best friends, we told each other everything and now he was keeping something from us.
 I could see it was eating at him, so why didn‚Äôt he tell us what it was?
 That was the question that was making me steam.
 ‚ÄúSeth out with it!‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know why I shouted.
 I startled him and he looked up at me.
 ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, Jazell?‚Äù ‚ÄúI mean tell me what you‚Äôre hiding!‚Äù I yelled at him.
 He stood up, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not hiding anything.‚Äù His voice was level but it shook slightly.
 I stepped towards him and gave him a hard shove.
 He stumbled back and fell on the ground.

 ‚ÄúMove along, move along,‚Äù Rodregas said.
 He prodded the prisoner up the roughly hewn stone steps none too gently with the butt end of the lit torch in his hand.
 "We don‚Äôt have all night."
 The rough handling of the prisoner seemed like a brash act for a man of sixty years, since the young man could have broken him in half with ease if he chose to do so.
 He was powerfully built, and towered head and shoulders over Rodregas.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she asked me ‚ÄúYou are looking at me like I asked you for your first born child,‚Äù she stated in a surprised voice.
 ‚ÄúLast night you two tried to kill me, I thought I was being very generous to share my hideout and give each of you a sword.
 Frankly I am worried that you will both give it back to me when I am sleeping tonight.‚Äù Imeralda looked surprisingly guilty, Doi‚Äôvan looked... well Rodregas could not guess what the expression on his blunt rough face meant.
 ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù said Imeralda once again shaking her long hair behind her, ‚ÄúI feel terrible about that.
 I told Audrian that I was not sure you were really Ravenhurr and that the spell did not go as planned.
 By the Infernals, if the spell had gone as planned I would have burned in creation fire and my magic would be inside of your body right now.‚Äù She caught him with those large amazingly green eyes and said, ‚ÄúI had a theory on what happened, but was not sure how to explain it so Audrian would understand.
 He was adamant, and I couldn‚Äôt argue with his logic, as he had said to you last night, you must be either Gerald or Ravenhurr.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut you aren‚Äôt,‚Äù she continued, ‚ÄúAnd well, you actually seem pretty nice, and you can handle yourself in a fight.
 I was just joking about the bow.
 You have been really generous.
 I was just talking.

"It didn't work."
 He stood up, taking her hands.
 "I'm sorry, Marie."
 He hugged her, murmuring, "We won't give up.
 And one morning when you least expect it, you'll walk back into your own garden."
 Marie closed her eyes, drawing strength from Rick.
 She just hoped he was right.
 And she hoped it would happen soon.
 After Rick had left for work, Marie walked on the treadmill for nearly 45 minutes and then made herself a cup of tea.
 Rested, she opened the box containing the exercise movie Rick had gotten her and with delight put it into the BCR.

"That's great, sir.
 Do you often work so closely with the local bank?
 I mean when the loan officer talked to my mom he said that there was no way to keep us from losing our house.
 I think she said his exact words were that it would take an act of God to change things now."
 A tiny fragment of memory rose to the surface of my mind.
 A time when Dad had been talking about negotiating with someone for work.
 "Don't be afraid of silence, Adri.
 Especially not when you know you're right.
 Let the silence work on people for a little while and they'll usually start to crack."
 That was the last thing I wanted to do right now, but I kept my mouth shut anyways.

The glittering deluge of chains and bracelets that went sliding across the floor would have made me feel bad enough all by themselves, but there was a proverbial scorpion nestled in the midst of all that shininess.
 I'd thrown mine out shortly after the accident.
 Part of me hadn't wanted to.
 It had felt like I was abandoning Cindi by doing so, but just seeing Cindi's half of the twin pendants we'd received two years before had been enough to send me into a tailspin.
 A detached part of me noted that it was just like Mom to have lied about having lost Cindi's.
 She'd known I couldn't handle the reminder of what we'd lost, but she'd been unwilling to give up that link to the past.
 The thought slipped away like sunlight skipping across water a split second before the storm arrived.
 The attack was a bad one.
 I lost more time.
 I must have slept at some point, but the next time I surfaced it was Saturday morning and I was sitting in front of an empty bowl with an unopened box of cereal and a gallon of milk waiting in the wings.

"Spread out and find her."
 The words were nearly unintelligible, coming as they did from a throat that shared little in common with Homo sapiens, but the venom behind them was unmistakable.
 I fled the bed where I'd been studying, and hid in Alec's studio, but I could hear them getting closer, the dissident melody of growls, howls, and destruction growing stronger as they rampaged through the house.
 Terror stretched time out, but even so it felt as though only seconds had passed before I felt Brandon enter Alec's suite.
 I crouched frozen on the floor as my death crept ever closer.
 As Brandon crashed through the studio's far wall in an explosion of plaster and lumber, I tried to shield my eyes, only to find that I couldn't move.
 The incongruity of being restrained when I couldn't see anything constraining my movements was enough to finally snap me back to wakefulness, but it was still several seconds before I stopped thrashing and realized it'd just been an extraordinarily terrifying nightmare.
 As soon as I stopped moving, the iron band around my arms relaxed and slipped away.
 "Are you okay?
 I'm sorry about that, I was afraid you were going to hurt yourself."

Mr. Whethers got the class involved in a discussion of Heathcliff's motivations, which kept everyone occupied for the full class time, and distracted me from what was likely to happen when Britney and I got to algebra.
 As we walked back to our lockers between classes, I noticed that the halls seemed strangely empty.
 Britney rolled her eyes when I asked why.
 "Of course nobody's here.
 Tonight's the full moon, and there was a monster party last night.
 There'll be another tonight and then again tomorrow."
 I felt my eyes go big.
 "You mean to tell me that seventy percent of the school parties for three nights running every month?"
 Britney nodded.
 "It's the only redeeming feature to this stupid little town, and I can't even go since the accident..." I could see her trying to figure out how to sidestep the issue, but I wasn't about to let her off the hook.

Alec was looking down at me with something almost like a smile playing at the corner of his lips.
 For a second I couldn't blame the other girls for swarming him over.
 He was so attractive it was hard to remember he was such a jerk.
 I forced myself to stop wondering if anyone else in the entire world had such incredibly blue eyes, and tilted my head to the side questioningly.
 "Sorry, I can tell you're not really in the mood to work on our project, especially with all of the racket today, but I saw you limping down the stairs just before lunch.
 Are you okay?"
 It was almost convincing.
 If he hadn't mentioned the stairs, and thereby the fight, I might have fallen for it, but he was just looking for more attention.
 "I'll be okay.
 Just a little sprain."

I fumbled, for the latch, but Rachel put a hand on my arm before I could get the door open.
 She handed me a white-wrapped package with a shy smile.
 "Hang in there.
 Oh, and happy birthday.
 Don't open it now, but I hope you like it."
 I whispered thanks as I hugged her goodbye, and then made my halting, limping way into the house.
 I was only in the house for fifteen minutes before I realized being all by myself was a terrible idea.
 At some point I transitioned from just crying to having a full-blown panic attack.
 It should've terrified me that something new was bringing on an episode, but it was like there was so much else going wrong I couldn't spare any more emotional energy.
 I came out of the attack and remained on the floor thinking about all of the good times I'd had with Dad and Cindi.

"No, you're not.
 I don't understand what you are, but you aren't a monster.
 Brandon is.
 Vincent, Cassie.
 They're all monsters, but you aren't."
 Alec finally let his eyes fully meet mine.
 "How can you know that when sometimes I'm not sure myself?"
 Almost without realizing it, I moved my hand from his arm to his stomach, and then wrapped both arms around him and pressed my face into his rock-hard chest.
 "Thank you for saving my life.
 Were those wolves some of Brandon's friends?"

 She took Marie's hand and drew her from the chair to her side on the bed.
 "I love you so much, and I would have been devastated if you'd never come home, but I'm sorry it cost you so much.
 I'm sorry it's causing you so much pain."
 They sat with their arms around each other for a long time.
 Mrs. Tranton at last gave her daughter a final squeeze.
 "Would you like to go downstairs for some tea or lemonade?"
 "No, thank you.
 I think I'll just go to bed."
 Mrs. Tranton rose.

She shifted and the markings on her leg caught my attention.
 A thin painted vine trailed up to her thigh.
 She noticed me looking.
 ‚ÄúWell, Frey, I feel like I know so much about you.‚Äù She smiled slyly at Chevelle.
 ‚ÄúBut you know so little of me.

As we drove off down the narrow road, Brandon waved.
 Could we really be getting our son back?
 We knew at least for now, he was exactly where he should be.
 He was far from the streets he once roamed and free from the drugs he once craved.
 Chapter 23: The Where, When & Why of Drugs We talked to Brandon as often as he could and we kept in touch with the counselors weekly.
 Over the next two months we received calls from our son and his counselor as he was in the part of the program where he was assigned to come clean with his family, acknowledge his behavior, and confess to the many terrible things he had done.
 The calls were very hard on us because even though they were necessary, we felt like he was getting so much better and we were getting all this bad news about stuff in the past.
 We understood that this was a necessary part of his treatment; he needed to cleanse himself and ask for our forgiveness.
 At the end of every confession he would ask if we would accept him back into the family to which we always answered yes!
 Every time Brandon called he seemed more mentally clear.

Brandon for once didn't have an easy comeback to defuse the awkwardness.
 If anything he looked slightly uncomfortable himself.
 "I'm sure it's nothing important..." He trailed off as my traitorous hand found his arm of its own accord and started pulling again.
 I wasn't sure why I was so anxious; usually I avoided crowds like the plague.
 Maybe I was just trying to prolong our time together.
 I let go as soon as we reached the fringe of the crowd, and prayed it was only my imagination that made me think Brandon was just the slightest bit relieved.
 Luckily there was plenty to distract me.
 It looked like there'd been some kind of war behind the school.
 The flagpole had a massive dent in its base, and actually looked like it was leaning slightly to one side.
 The straggly grass, kept just barely alive by the nearly non-existent rain and infrequent watering by some anonymous grounds keeper, had been torn up.

Marie had emerged from the dressing room carrying the black and pink suit.
 Rick looked up, managing a smile.
 "OK."  He bought it for her, looking forward to seeing her in it again tomorrow.
 He noticed that she'd bound her breasts again.
 "Listen, Marie, there are a couple of other things I want you to get."
 "What?"
 "Let's go in here."
 He led her into a large department store and began searching for ladies' lingerie.
 While Marie looked around at all the lacy, sometimes colorful articles, Rick found a saleslady.
 "My friend over there, for reasons I won't go into, may not know her sizes.

He'd always had a hard time keeping his eyes off her at the beach, but today it was impossible.
 She was so gorgeous.
 He watched as she rubbed lotion on her lovely legs, her silky dark hair falling forward as she did so.
 Marie, not noticing any difference in his stare, smiled as she handed him the bottle.
 "Will you put some on my back?"
 She stretched out on her stomach.
 He ran his hands up and down and around her back, massaging and caressing.
 Her skin was so soft.
 He dropped a kiss onto her shoulder.
 "Does that feel good?"

I convinced myself I was imagining the way he studied me as he sat against the downed tree.
 He had no idea what I was thinking.
 It was the furthest thing from his mind.
 ‚ÄúNo?‚Äù I asked, unable to mask the tremor in my voice.
 ‚ÄúMagic first.‚Äù That wasn‚Äôt exactly a relief.
 It was obvious he saw my anxiety, but I couldn‚Äôt be sure he wasn‚Äôt enjoying it.
 He just remained sitting there.
 ‚ÄúWhat should I do?‚Äù A sly grin crossed his face and he rolled his hand out in front of him.
 ‚ÄúYou are only limited by your imagination, Freya.‚Äù Great, so if I screwed up it was just a problem with my mind.
 I considered that, recalling what Steed had said about feeling it, thinking about what you wanted to happen.

She never would have dreamed that her disappearance would bring her family closer together.
 John and Mrs. Tranton went to get dressed, doing so in record time.
 The four were in the living room discussing a late August trip to Cape Cod when the doorbell rang.
 Marie's hands shook as she set her teacup aside.
 She rose just as Davis appeared in the living room.
 "Darling!"
 He crossed the room to draw her into his arms, kissing her cheek.
 "What happened to you?"
 "We're not discussing that right now, Davis," Mrs. Tranton said.
 "We're just enjoying having her back."

A flicker of movement caught my eye and I turned to find a hawk perched on the ledge of a balcony.
 Suddenly, I needed fresh air more than anything.
 Chevelle helped me to my feet and I walked, a little wobbly, to the door.
 I had been dressed in a vest of dark leather and slim pants, carved medallions adorning my chest, but my feet were bare as they crossed the polished stone floor of the bedroom, at ease in a place they seemed to know.
 I stepped out into the sun, and I had to steady myself on the stone ledge.
 Not because of the lightheadedness, though I was feeling faint, but because below me, before the steps to what I now realized was a castle, a thousand elves watched me.
 I sucked in a harsh breath, unable to get my mind to accept what I knew was happening.
 I had been so oblivious.
 Reading the diary, learning of my mother and her ties to the throne.
 It had told of my own life, of what I was to become, a reality that would not be put to rights in my broken mind.

The guardsmen's armor was less decorated and held only an engraving of their sigil animals.
 The guard on the right had an engraving on his Pauldrons, the piece of armor that protects his shoulders of the Celestial beast know as The Stag while the man on the left had an engraving of The Mastiff.
 After a moment, that seemed to stretch longer than was polite, the Immortal Guard to the right slowly nodded and with no hand touching it; the two massive doors opened to welcome him into the sanctum.
 Van‚Äôdret hurried through the open doors before the guard changed his mind.
 He normally found the sight of the Immortal Guards reassuring; the great sigil warriors were sworn to the protection of Immortalist, like himself, but he knew these two would cut him down like a common pauper if they sensed he was a danger to their Master.
 There was a short hallway leading from the doors with slim white columns on each side of the hallway, in between each column hung great pieces of art; paintings, sculptures and even a small wall hanging with amazing vibrant colors with a strange abstract design were all preserved in the space.
 Van‚Äôdret was a man of some refinement and appreciation for art, and he wished he had dared to stop and inspect the pieces; they had to be some of the greatest art works in the Realm to be so on display where only those who had been invited to a private meeting with Taiga would see them.
 However Van‚Äôdret dared to do nothing more than glance at them as he hurried forward.
 It would not be smart to make the Guild Dealer wait for even a moment.
 The Guild Dealer Taiga was not such a common man that he did his work from a desk; his desires and commands came during parties and social events.

He slid his two swords out from their sheaths, stunned by the ease in which he moved them.
 It was if they went from being made of steel to air.
 He tossed them aside.
 Velixar pulled from within his cloak a chest the size of a small stone.
 He placed it on the grass where it shone gold in the light of the stars.
 As the two brothers watched, he whispered a few words of magic, enlarging the chest to normal size.
 ‚ÄúOver the centuries, I have gathered many items to aid those who would swear their lives to me,‚Äù Velixar said.
 The locks clicked open, the lid raised, and then he reached inside and pulled out two swords sheathed in gleaming obsidian.
 ‚ÄúThese swords were once wielded by Aerland Shen.
 He led the elves that aided Karak in the great war against Ashhur.

In those first years back, the times I lived for were coaching Cody and the team during practices and ball games at Kuhlken Field, home of La Mesa National Little League.
 Named after my dad since he had been president and organized the renovation of the field.
 During our games, pulling for Cody, I came to understand why a father I knew dropped dead in the stands, when his heart failed while his son was pitching.
 As teenagers, my kids carried on the family tradition of abject rebellion, to the degree that I wrote a Reader story about the Tough Love group I was attending weekly.
 The year my kids began to climb out of the mud, I met Pam.
 * Back when I had only one child, someone told me that two was as easy or easier than one.
 Whoever said that ought to be gagged.
 At least in my family, while one kid slept, the other wouldn‚Äôt.
 When one behaved, the other raised hell.
 Everything one gets, the other wants.

 "Donovan said Dad used to tell me stories every night.
 After Dad died Donovan took over telling them to both Rachel and me.
 It wasn't until after I grew up that I found out they were legends about where we came from.
 That we weren't normal like everyone else."
 "Like the...dayborn?
 What did you mean earlier?"
 Alec was quiet for so long that I thought maybe he wasn't going to answer.

Yeah, it‚Äôs about growing up next to that river, Big Muddy in my veins, also about being born just a few miles from Niagara Falls, and, briefly it makes mention of the Pacific.

 Qurrah was in no hurry as he left the city behind.
 The grass was soft and tall, and it felt good under his feet after so much sprinting down stone roads.
 Stars filled the sky, and he smiled to them often.
 In the distance, he spotted a small fire, and he knew to whom it belonged.
 ‚ÄúWhere is your brother?‚Äù Velixar asked as Qurrah approached.
 ‚ÄúHe has abandoned me,‚Äù Qurrah said, pulling at his robes.
 He glanced back to the town, hoping to change the topic.

Now that it's live, I can only say that I hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
 If you haven't read Torn yet, please go check it out.
 When I set out to write Broken, I never expected that I was going to end up writing the same story from Alec's point of view, but I'm pleased with how both Broken and Torn have turned out, both individually and as a combined work.
 They are done in very different styles, but ultimately that was exactly what I was after.
 I think there is plenty of cross-over of guys reading paranormal romance, and girls picking up more action-packed stories.
 Ultimately I think most of us just want a compelling story, but sometimes the labels that get applied to books get in the way of us discovering them, rather than helping as they are meant to do.
 I think one of the things that made the Harry Potter books so successful was the fact that the whole family could share in the series.
 I remember as Twilight came out thinking that there were plenty of guys who would enjoy Twilight if they ever sat down and read it, but most of them wouldn't ever give it a try.
 My hope with Broken and Torn is that the two stories combine into something that both guys and girls can enjoy.
 The girls are likely to start out with Broken, while guys are likely to pick up Torn and enjoy the extra action there.

I didn‚Äôt argue after that.
 I wouldn‚Äôt have been allowed to leave the castle anyway.
 Besides, it kept her from being paraded in front of so many visitors.
 I stopped again.
 I had been born in a castle.
 I sat with the journal for a long moment.
 There was no way to reconcile this information with my own thoughts, no way to fill in what the bonds had taken.
 It hurt to read this, but there was no not finishing it.
 I decided the only way to keep going was if I did it as I had before I‚Äôd known it was my mother, as if I were an uninvolved reader.
 My Freya has grown into a stubborn and willful child.

I was absently sketching what I expected the inside of the opera house to look like, when a tap on my shoulder pulled me out of my reverie.
 "I'm so sorry, Mrs. Campbell.
 I finished early, but I should have started on one of the catch-up assignments.
 I just didn't want to get into a whole new subject with only ten minutes left."
 Her smile was much more understanding than normal for a classroom situation.
 It took the sting out of the words that were probably just for the people close enough to overhear.
 "Don't you worry, Miss Paige, I'll let you know when I don't think you're keeping up.
 Seeing as you are done though, would you please run something over to Mrs. North?
 I'd do it, but I need to go to a special projects meeting today during lunch."
 As quickly as that, my books were in my backpack and I was on my way to the second story of the school, which housed music, sketching, and all the other forms of art lesser mortals like me would never master.

World peace and prosperity in the coming decades will depend on our willingness boldly to confront this issue.
 At the end of the Second World War the victorious nations joined together to found the UN.
 At the end of the Cold War, the organization needs to be re-founded, and restructured according to democratic principles, to give a more active role and more equitable representation to people of all nations.
 To deem such considerations unrealistic given the present alignment of power in the world is a short-sighted view.
 It ignores the incredible speed and scope of changes that have radically transformed international relations over the past half decade.
 It assumes that the present system has the backing of the international community and that it can and will sustain itself regardless of whatever steps we may contemplate.
 A fundamental change in structure is essential and inevitable.
 The break-up of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War have resulted in the demise of the bipolar system which dominated international relations after 1945.
 The United States is now recognized as the sole superpower and the primary determinant of actions by the UN Security Council.
 But neither America‚Äôs culture nor its historical economic and political development and present outlook will permit it to take on the extraordinary responsibilities and overseas commitments which fulfilment of this role necessitates, as its reluctance to get involved in Bosnia and Rwanda, and its quick withdrawal from Somalia illustrate.

I have always heard stories of the knights and would enjoy visiting the Cathedral.
 It is supposed to be a place of great magic and many myths and stories.‚Äù Rodregas nodded, he could not help smiling.
 He enjoyed the company of the two of them.
 It would be good to continue to travel together.
 The next day Imeralda arranged to send a group of fellow Forest Nymphs back to the farm to put a roof on the old farmhouse.
 It was probably not worth the cost of some of their excess equipment and limited gold, but the three of them all had good memories of the farm and liked the idea putting a roof back on the structure.
 The Nymphs with their connection with nature were the only humanoids unlikely to be attacked by the Dire Cats.
 The biggest surprise came when Jordaan came to say goodbye.
 Rodregas had his stuff all spread out in the room he had been using, organizing what would go where.
 The trunk had been left in the barn back at the farm, but its contents were now in his saddlebag.

They'll never waste a thought on you or me, or pretty much anyone."
 The way she said their names implied they were a couple.
 Even if they weren't, she was probably right about not getting my hopes up.
 Especially considering the way Alec had looked at me there at the end.
 Despite my best efforts the question still slipped out.
 "They're together then?"
 Britney smirked.
 "You really are masochistic, aren't you?
 That's the rumor.
 Nobody really seems to know, at least nobody who's talking, but they're almost always together.

I had pretty much given up on Thomas, and I was afraid to give up on Brandon.
 Over the years, Thomas had conned me out of thousands of dollars.
 He had an uncanny ability to put together some huge deal making himself absurd amounts of money and then blowing it all on a high roller lifestyle followed by being completely broke and desperate and addicted to drugs again and again.
 Thomas had also conned or borrowed thousands of dollars from mutual friends and associates, and it was not uncommon for my wife and me to be confronted by angry people in restaurants or public places because my brother owed them money.
 The last straw with Thomas was over Christmas many years back when he became so violent and threatening that Lisa and I decided to not see him or his family again.
 We even told our children that if Uncle Thomas came to our house or ever tried to get them in a car that they were to run to any other adult.
 We did not know what drug he was on or how far he would go.
 When he moved to southern California, we were not faced with Thomas‚Äôs problems anymore.
 I crossed him off of my list‚Äîthe brother who had stood shoulder to shoulder with me through all the moves, the abuse, and so much else.
 The brother who for a while was all I had was completely estranged from me.

His life was more boring than anything else.
 He approached the door to the tower roof with the prisoners.
 Instead of formulating a plan of action his mind kept going back to the horror of last week's practice when his master, Ravenhurr, demanded a rehearsal of the ritual ceremony with the senior guards.
 At the time he assumed they would merely walk through the procedure.
 Ravenhurr, however, was the kind of man who demanded perfection.
 He demanded it both in himself and from those around him.
 That perfection required no less than an exact replication of the ceremony.
 As usual, he acceded to his master's wishes and did as he was told.
 He knew the value of following orders and it had kept him alive so far.
 When he placed his hand on the tower door an involuntary shudder racked his body at the idea of following those orders one more time.

The city known as the Menagerie of Sky, Earth and Water that Taiga ruled and had created over the centuries was a lush place, full of pleasures and growing things.
 Anything that could be found in the world was said to be found within its gleaming walls and exotic gardens.
 However, the private place where it‚Äôs Master worked, was a stark contrast.
 It‚Äôs marble columns and arched ceiling spoke of simply sophistication and understated power, and much more accurately reflected the nature of its owner than the over the top shows and pleasures of the Menagerie.
 Two small intricate waterfalls softly trickled down each side wall to the, providing a soft soothing sound.
 The back of the room was an archway leading to the terrace, overhead the incredible crystal ceiling let in the natural daylight of the late afternoon sun and would illuminate the top of the tower under its own power during the night.
 In the middle of the room was an enameled silver table set for two, with Taiga lounging in his throne like chair on the opposite side of Van‚Äôdret.
 Van‚Äôdret hurried forward and fell to his knees with his head lowered; he did not say a word until after Taiga spoke.

‚ÄúHe simply wanted me to keep an eye out when I travel to the Cathedral of the Heavens,‚Äù he responded.
 The two of them were slowly walking back to his suite through the gleaming marble corridors with their wide windows and breath taking views of the city below; they both shared polite nods to other Immortalist, mostly young Adapts who resided in the city.
 She did not respond to his answer at first, finally she asked ‚ÄúDoes he want you to keep an eye out for Oreintvenir?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret shook his head and said.
 ‚ÄúHe mentioned Ravenhurr as a concern.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut, he simply went mad.
 That is not uncommon,‚Äù she said with a voice laced with surprise.
 ‚ÄúActually,‚Äù said Van‚Äôdret, ‚Äúit is very rare for a Master of Ravenhurr‚Äôs level to go mad.
 I am not sure if you ever met him, but he was good, very good.‚Äù ‚ÄúThen in that case we had better all keep our eyes open.‚Äù She said.
 CHAPTER 7 A TIME TO PREPARE
 Rodregas woke up first, at dawn.
 He stayed in his bed just thinking and reviewing all that he had gone through in the last few days; it was a lot to adjust to.

 With all the crap that mom pulled, well, she never once hit me.
 She was never that bad.
 I hate her for what she did.

 Jim ‚Äì Yep.

 Jim ‚Äì About what?
 Johnny ‚Äì About Gene and his asshole father.

After such a beginning, my day could hardly be anything but great.
 One class after another rolled by, and all of the things that normally would've bothered me just went whipping past without managing to stick.
 I couldn't remember the second phase of cell division in Biology.
 I'd forgotten to reread the last chapter of Wuthering Heights, and Britney went out of her way to snub me.
 The only thing I cared about was making it to lunch so I could see Brandon again.
 I dawdled on my way to Algebra, so much so I was nearly late for class.
 It wasn't until I sat down at my desk and felt a wave of disappointment slither through me that I realized I'd been hoping to see Brandon in between classes.
 Mrs. Campbell caught me before I could leave for lunch.
 "Adriana, your homework is progressing along very well.
 At the risk of having you slow down, I'm going to admit that you're well ahead of where I'd hoped you'd be.

Only handfuls live within these walls, and they are just diplomats and messengers.
 Our king is a spiteful, paranoid one.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúNot my king,‚Äù Harruq muttered loud as he dared.
 He meant to say more but stopped as another man neared the fountain.
 He was large, well-muscled, and scratching at a long beard that stretched down to his belt.
 In a massive voice, he shouted to the mulling throngs.
 ‚ÄúThe royal guard is in need of able-bodied men to help rebuild the walls of the city,‚Äù he shouted.
 ‚ÄúThe work will be hard, but we offer a threepence of copper a day.
 Come to the castle and ask for Alvrik.‚Äù
 He repeated the message three more times and then wandered back north.

Just one.
 As he reached to open a drawer he felt his leg jerk back, halting his momentum.
 He crashed to the floor, screaming in pain as one of his forearms landed hard.
 Then he felt his ankle start to burn.
 ‚ÄúTake him, brother,‚Äù Qurrah said, his whip wrapped around Ahrqur‚Äôs left foot.
 Harruq did not bother to cross the distance.
 He had had enough.
 Condemnation flew through the air, its aim true.
 The blade sank into the elf‚Äôs back.
 Blood and fluid covered the carpet as all life fled the body of Ahrqur Tun‚Äôdel.

Alec unpinned my arms, set me down, and then chuckled as I started gingerly probing my scalp.
 "What are you doing?
 You didn't actually hit your head.
 I caught you before you hit the ground."
 I started to shake my head and then thought better of it.
 "Please, every other time I've dropped that quickly I've totally banged myself up.
 You were on the other side of my desk, there's no way you got all the way around it and managed to catch me before I hit the ground."
 The mild amusement on Alec's face froze into something else.
 "Believe what you will.
 There's no reason to worry about a concussion."

I have watched you two slaughter my brethren.
 I have seen much of your handiwork.‚Äù The elf glared at him, ugly hatred skewing his handsome features.
 ‚ÄúBy now your brother is dead.
 Three of my best warriors await him around that corner.
 I thought it appropriate you knew this before I took your life.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúDo not talk to me of what is appropriate,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúKill me, if you will, but do not bore me with your chatter.
 I have suffered beyond anything you can do to me.‚Äù
 A firestorm of anger overwhelmed the elf‚Äôs features.
 He stepped back and drew an arrow.

I wondered if this was fiction, a fairy ruse, given to Chevelle by Ruby.
 Or maybe the dust was still playing havoc on me.
 I glanced over my shoulder at Ruby where she watched anxiously out the front window.
 I shook my head, finding the line again‚Ä¶
 But I couldn‚Äôt deny it.
 Their size was about that of an elf, but all were different.
 The men were thicker.
 Not necessarily with muscle, some more bulbous.
 The women were varied as well, some thin and wiry, some stout like the males.
 Their hair was in all shades‚Äîlight blond like the sun, brown as the trees, one even had rusty red, his plump cheeks peppered with light brown spots.

‚ÄúAre you all right?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 Doi‚Äôvan nodded and then said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get out of the chamber.‚Äù Rodregas nodded, as he wanted to check on Imeralda.
 Doi‚Äôvan seemed to have his balance back.
 Rodregas wondered if Doi‚Äôvan had lost his balance because he had been trying to fly instead of walk.
 As they stepped out of the room of Infernal sigils and carefully closed the door behind them, Doi‚Äòvan still seemed unsteady and Rodregas wondered if his own experiences had prepared him more naturally for this.
 Rodregas had changed bodies before.
 ‚ÄúDoi‚Äôvan, why don‚Äôt you sit down and rest for a second?
 I will check on Imeralda,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan nodded his thanks and sank down on the floor.
 Doi‚Äôvan seemed to need to think more than rest, but either way Rodregas made sure he was ok and then went to check on Imeralda.
 He hoped she had not touched the One Tree.

"You know me.
 You trust me.
 You've spent more time with me than you spent with your fianc√© in a month--" "Three months."
 "--and you have a certain right to feel possessive."
 He kissed the top of her head.
 "We'll leave it at that for now, OK?"
 "OK." After a few moments, he raised his head and pulled away slightly.
 When she looked up at him, so beautiful and trusting and fragile, he bent his head to kiss her.
 But she turned her face away.
 "I'm sorry," he whispered, kissing her temple instead of her lips, her full, soft, luscious red lips .

You should go get some sleep; the joust should be going on for hours.‚Äù She nodded as he got in the saddle.
 But before he could ride out she asked, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt suppose you want to explain why you wanted to know about them?‚Äù ‚ÄúI am not sure, just thinking about options,‚Äù he answered.
 Then he pulled Doom Hoof through a wide turn and tried to get him moving and warmed up.
 If the beast felt any excitement or nervousness he was not showing it.
 Which Rodregas admitted was better than the opposite reaction.
 But the horse felt incredibly sluggish compared to his own mount.
 Hopefully, the horses positive qualities would shine in the tournament.
 As Rodregas circled around the courtyard warming up his horse he noticed fewer horses than he expected.
 After Doom Hoof seemed awake he headed over to where Doi‚Äôvan stood.
 For this competition each squire was allowed a servant to provide support, mostly assistance with equipment, especially fresh lances.

If you would like to share this book with another person, please purchase an additional copy for each recipient.
 Thank you for respecting the hard work of this author.
 Dedication I dedicate this book to my wife Lisa, the one person who has been with me through more ups and downs than anyone could ever imagine.
 You never know when or if the perfect person will appear.
 The fateful night I set eyes on her set in motion everything that would happen to me for the rest of my life.
 I couldn‚Äôt be happier that I was fortunate enough to be in the right place at the perfect time to meet my soul mate.
 She is the most beautiful person, both inside and out.
 She has been an inspiration for me and making her happy is the goal of my life.
 We are best friends, confidants, partners, and true lovers and together we are one.
 I can‚Äôt imagine my existence without her, and I know that everything I am and all I will become is shaped by her genuine kindness.

An institutional gap exists in agricultural training systems.
 In most developing countries, agricultural colleges, universities and polytechnics train researchers, government, bank employees and extension officers, but not farmers.
 Producing more food with less water, less chemicals and less soil erosion requires high levels of skill.
 The chain of agricultural training needs to be filled out at the lower level by establishing thousands of village-level farm schools as proposed in the chapter on food security.
 The switch from centrally planned to market-oriented economic systems in Eastern Europe cannot be successful until the population has acquired the skills needed to function effectively in the new economic environment.
 Under the communist system, emphasis was placed on education and training in technical subjects with little attention to marketing, organizational, commercial and interpersonal skills, which are essential requirements for functioning in a market economy.
 A detailed inventory should be compiled of the types and levels of skills needed for transition to the market, covering areas such as entrepreneurship, management, national and international marketing, strategic business planning, finance, quality control, product development, production technology, design, and human resource development.
 Intensive training programmes need to be introduced to impart these skills on a massive scale.
 Even in the most advanced industrial nations there is vast scope for upgrading skills to improve productivity and to keep pace with rapid technological development.
 Inadequate skills are a major impediment to the assimilation of new technologies.

I stopped Rachel just before she could put the impressive lungful of air she'd just taken in to whatever use she'd planned.
 "It's okay.
 I'm better.
 The lane's dusty and exercise would do me good."
 She hesitated, obviously torn, but my fumbling fingers finally found the unfamiliar door release and I made the decision for her.
 I swung the door open and slipped out of the car before she could respond.
 I waved goodbye with a cheery casualness I thought did a pretty good job of hiding my desire to break into tears.
 It was amazing how I'd let the numbness slip away for nothing.
 Rachel wasn't any more my friend than she'd been a few minutes before.
 Instead she was probably freaked out.

It took the sting out of the words that were probably just for the people close enough to overhear.
 "Don't you worry, Miss Paige, I'll let you know when I don't think you're keeping up.
 Seeing as you are done though, would you please run something over to Mrs. North?
 I'd do it, but I need to go to a special projects meeting today during lunch."
 As quickly as that, my books were in my backpack and I was on my way to the second story of the school, which housed music, sketching, and all the other forms of art lesser mortals like me would never master.
 The journey would've been completely unremarkable except that I happened to glance into one of the classrooms just before I found Mrs. North's room.
 Even a brief glance screamed art students.
 There were at least twenty people sitting in front of contraptions that looked like a cross between an easel and a desk, and most of them had the look of intense concentration I'd come to associate with Mom attempting to frame a picture.
 The notable exception was Alec, who I almost didn't recognize.
 I hadn't expected to see him in an art class, but more than that was the way his face seemed transformed.

‚ÄúAt last!‚Äù Felewen cried, staring out from a side alley.
 They were behind a group of ten soldiers battling a pair of elven warriors who stood back to back.
 ‚ÄúMake haste, they need us!‚Äù
 Felewen charged, desperate to arrive before her brethren were overwhelmed.
 Aurelia stepped into the street and summoned her magic.
 Frost surrounded her hands, and a thin sheet of ice spread beneath the human soldiers.
 Many of them stumbled, unable to balance the sword and shield in their hands and the heavy chainmail on their bodies.
 Felewen slid on one leg, her sword out and ready.
 She passed right between two men, slicing out heels and tendons as she flew by.
 The elf reached the end of the ice, turned, and went sliding back.

 Just sit on my veranda, and when the fog lifts, we‚Äôll-we‚Äôll see if we can find your house.‚Äù Afraid of becoming even more lost, she hesitantly followed him to some chairs and perched on the edge of one.
 The man ran inside, and before she could decide whether it was better to wait or leave, he‚Äôd returned with a newspaper.
 Marie read one headline: "Obama Popularity Index Declining."
 Neither the words nor the picture meant anything to her.
 Then she checked the date: May 22, 2011.
 She raised her eyes to the man's.
 "This is a joke."
 "No.
 I can't explain it--I don't believe in such things.

 "It depends on what you want."
 He made them a salad and put two frozen lasagna dinners in the microwave.
 It wasn't the best lunch he could offer a guest from the 1920s, but it was the only thing he could think of to prepare in the microwave.
 Marie seemed fascinated by it.
 "Lasagna in ten minutes.

 She touched a forkful to her tongue, finding that it was too hot.
 She blew it and then tasted it.
 "Delicious."

My hands were bandaged, as was my elbow and right calf.
 My dirty, ripped jeans and shirt had been replaced with clean clothes that were only a little too small.
 That last fact should have alarmed me more than it did.
 Somehow being stripped down by a stranger paled in comparison to a near-death hallucination involving wolves and a monster straight out of a science fiction movie.
 The bedroom was possibly the nicest room I'd ever been in.
 A movie star or millionaire would have had a hard time topping this place for sheer decadence.
 The walls were paneled in some kind of rare, doubtless expensive imported hardwood.
 The bookcases that covered the majority of the wall space seemed to be made out of the same kind of wood, and were filled with more books than I'd seen in the local bookstore the one time I'd convinced Britney to stop by on our way home after school.
 They were all hardbound, with leather bindings and engraved covers.
 There was a stereo system off in one corner, hooked up to a laptop and some kind of portable music player.

Mana is the raw energy of magic no matter what its source.
 You can use mana from any source to cast spells.‚Äù He looked around at the three of them to make sure they understood.
 Rodregas felt like he was back in a classroom, as he had been as a child in the Cathedral of the Knights.
 In truth all three were very interested, as magic was something that was very much affecting their lives at the moment.
 Rodregas noticed that while Imeralda‚Äôs expression was one of simple enjoyment at refining her knowledge with an expert, Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs seemed almost made of rock.
 It seemed as if he feared that if he moved, his inclusion in the discussion would be challenged.
 Jordaan, apparently satisfied with their attention, continued ‚ÄúOur ability to manipulate the sources of mana seems to be a relationship of our blood connection to a realm.
 Mortals, to a greater or lesser extent; have an ability to tap into the mana that has overflowed into our realm from the Celestial, Infernal and Elemental Realms.
 I, for one, believe that if our connections to these realms were cut,‚Äù Jordaan made a motion like knife cutting a loaf of bread, ‚Äúthat in a few years there would not be enough magic for us to use.‚Äù ‚ÄúLuckily, I can think of no way for such a thing to happen.
 But a mortal‚Äôs ability to use mana that has spilled into the mortal world is very limited.

They‚Äôre the joke of most middle school kids, they‚Äôre tall‚Ä¶I think.

 Emily landed on us and we all tumbled onto hard ground.

‚ÄúAre you all right?‚Äù she asked, coming back into the room with a towel and spreading it flat onto the bed, then bending down and helping me untie my shoes.
 ‚ÄúI have back problems,‚Äù I said, standing to remove my dress shirt, exposing the back brace which I removed with angst.
 ‚ÄúHave your doctors given you anything for the pain?‚Äù she asked, helping my shirt off of each shoulder.
 I told her I had been given many medications, but I needed to be able to work my job so couldn‚Äôt take most of them.
 ‚ÄúI am a Financial Planner and I can‚Äôt afford to be loopy,‚Äù I said.
 ‚ÄúWhat kinds of stuff do they give you?‚Äù She pooched out her lower lip and tried to look more sad than excited.
 The conversation was headed quickly in the direction I had planned.
 I told her they had given me Vicodin, Darvocet and Oxycodone, which I definitely couldn‚Äôt tolerate.
 She was quickly moving towards the hook in this trap.
 ‚ÄúWhat do you do with the drugs if you don‚Äôt take them?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve probably got one hundred Oxycodone pills in my safe at home with as many refills as I want, but I won‚Äôt be using them,‚Äù I said.

 She squeezed his hands.
 "I want to listen to my father's jokes, even though they're not funny.
 I want to sneak off to see my brother and to go to a speakeasy with my cousin Tom.
 Most of all, I want to talk to my mother.
 And--"  She choked back a sob.
 "And what I want most to talk to her about is you.
 I want to tell her how much I love you, how wonderful you are, how getting to know you made me realize that I could never spend my life with Davis.
 I want to tell her how thoughtful you are, how loving.

His house was big, and he had a lot of interesting things, but she didn't like being alone.
 It just made her miss her family and friends and Davis that much more.
 Hoping that television would provide the illusion of companionship and take her mind off her homesickness, she went to the living room and turned it on.
 That was where Rick found her at 5:30.
 "Hi--how was your day?"
 She turned off the TV and looked at him with wide eyes.
 "Do you know how many women there are who have love affairs with their husbands' brothers?"
 Rick groaned.
 "You've been watching talk shows."
 "There was one woman who was having an affair with her husband's 15-year-old brother!

I was like zombied.
 I had no idea that boys and girls did such things.
 I immediately went home and wrote her a song.
 CM: 	You remember it?
 BG:  	Ha.
 Well, yeah, some of it.
 ‚ÄúCathy took me/out of the cold/Cathy took me/she was so bold.‚Äù  (laughs)  Shit.
 Ok, it was awful, but what other tribute could I give to such a fine gift?
 I wonder where she is now.
 Probably married some tax accountant or corporate lawyer.

Then I thanked him and here we are, inside the cave nice and dry.‚Äù ‚ÄúMaybe that's your power, you can speak to dragons,‚Äù Seth suggested.
 ‚ÄúBut I don't understand how you two get powers and we don't.‚Äù ‚ÄúBe patient,‚Äù I said.
 ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Emily murmured and stifled a yawn.
 ‚ÄúGirls first, Seth.
 Have a problem with that?‚Äù ‚ÄúAll right then,‚Äù he said and leaned against the wall.
 ‚ÄúSweet dreams to you two.‚Äù ‚ÄúYup sweet dreams to us,‚Äù I said and closed my eyes.
 ‚ÄúGoodnight Emily.‚Äù ‚ÄúGoodnight Jazell.‚Äù I drifted off, feeling surprising comfy against Seth's shoulder and hearing Jason softy snore.
 I opened my eyes to see myself standing in the woods.
 The sky saw clearer and it wasn't raining anymore.
 It was eerie quiet and as I stood there it felt like I had never left the woods.

With only nine points he was unlikely to be able to compete in the final championship melee.
 ‚ÄúImeralda, can you do me a favor?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúOf course, but I am not sure how I can help,‚Äù she said.
 Rodregas nodded, but said, ‚ÄúCan you go around to the other top finishers and talk to them, and also go around tonight to the other squires and try to get a feel for them.
 See if  you can find out who people want to win and why?‚Äù Imeralda was clearly confused by the odd request, but nodded, and after a little talk she slipped away to the food line and within moments was in an animated discussion with a few squires at another table.
 Rodregas thought Doi‚Äôvan might ask, but he showed no interest and instead said, ‚ÄúWhile most of the knights are too high and mighty to talk to a Hellborn, the staff is not so closed mouthed.
 The greater sigils are said to be guarded twenty four hours a day in a great chamber in the very heart of the Cathedral.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd did you ask if sworn men were allowed in with a new knight?‚Äù asked Rodregas with a smile.
 ‚ÄúActually the topic did come up,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan with a chuckle like rocks in a land slide.
 ‚ÄúWhile guards are usually not allowed in, it is not unusual for close friends or advisors to go in with some of those of the blood; to share their wisdom on the best possible greater sigils to take on.‚Äù ‚ÄúI will assume,‚Äù said Rodregas, ‚Äúthat they had never heard of a Nymph entering the chamber, much less one of the Hellborn?‚Äù ‚ÄúAElves are not uncommon and actually more Orqui than I expected.
 One servant thought that Nymphs used to go in during his father‚Äôs, father‚Äôs time, but not any time recently.

He turned to go.
 Aurelia grabbed his hand and stopped him.
 ‚ÄúWhere will you go?‚Äù
 The elf glanced back to her.
 ‚ÄúWar is coming.
 I must alert my kin.
 If this man and his army do attack Woodhaven, he will find the Quellan army descending upon him from the sky.
 Besides, I have been separated from Sonowin far too long.
 I miss her.‚Äù
 Aurelia smiled for the first time since she had seen Dieredon.

This is especially true of pregnant females.
 The strongest dire animals are not just those of nearest descent, but also those who come to term in high magical environments.‚Äù Rodregas nodded, he had heard bits of this but he had not really thought about it.
 Doi‚Äôvan stretched his hands up and up to an impressive height, and a smile spread across his face, the first one Rodregas had seen on the Hellborn face.
 It was good to see, though it was also a little scary as his teeth were more pointed than Rodregas was used to seeing.
 His teeth had more in common with the Dire Cats than himself or Imeralda.
 ‚ÄúOf course, I know this first hand as it is the same for us Hellborn.
 We will not grow strong if we do not spend much of our childhood in a place that is rich in magic.
 This place feels very good.
 The last few years the only time I was in a place rich in magic, I was also a prisoner.
 It is good not to hunger for magic and be FREE!‚Äù Rodregas was, of course, curious about the Hellborn‚Äôs background but had been hesitant to ask.

But I had no idea if an animal killed by magic was edible.
 I thought of the thistle, its black roots, how it had turned to ash.
 The rabbit sniffed at the air in my direction and continued on its way, answering the matter for me.
 I was sitting in a hole, utterly alone, and it was beginning to get dark.
 Night bugs chittered, their high-pitched keens rising with the loss of light.
 I lit a thin flame to practice fire magic, leaning forward as I danced it back and forth above the ground.
 My control had progressed a good deal since my training had begun; it seemed almost easy to navigate a small flame.
 I smoothed it out into a line and traced arcs and then more intricate designs.
 The designs started to resemble portraits and I had to concentrate hard to keep from seeing them, so I focused on landscapes, but those grew from tiny village houses and trees to rolling hills and curving creeks.
 Before long, the hills rose to mountains that melted into unidentifiable monsters.

Then Cliff joined the rest of us.
 The parked station wagon we rammed might've saved our lives, as it kept the convertible from running up the side of a bank and flipping onto our heads.
 The station wagon was wrecked, Bob's Ford was totaled, and the four of us got cited on account of the case of beer in the trunk, which was meant for the beach party.
 Maybe in consideration of it being our prom-night, the police dropped charges on the condition that Cliff agreed to pay off the station wagon owner.
 I offered to split the pay off.
 Cliff and I postponed our move to San Francisco and went looking for work, which we found at Coffee Dan's restaurant in Grossmont Center, a mall we could see from the front yard of my mom's hilltop home.
 I was a pot washer six days a week, a split shift, 10-2 and 6-10.
 Sundays and late evenings I played with Liz.
 Before work and between shifts, I carried on where Eric had left off reading dark novels.
 One of them was Crime and Punishment, by Fyodor Dostoyevski.

Anvil had stood before the man, but any one of them could have snapped his spine.
 ‚ÄúFrey.‚Äù Chevelle‚Äôs tone was solemn.
 ‚ÄúYou know what they did to your mother.‚Äù And I could hear what he didn‚Äôt say.
 You know what they‚Äôll do to you.
 I didn‚Äôt have a counter for that and he knew it.
 He took advantage of the silence, giving orders to Ruby.
 ‚ÄúTake her to the house.‚Äù She had me at once, towing me beside her as she retrieved our cloaks.
 Chevelle was still instructing, ‚ÄúSteed, watch the front, stay inside.
 Grey, take the rear, out of sight.
 Anything, no matter how trivial, signal the wolves.‚Äù Wolves.

I've never come so close to losing control."
 He wasn't breathing hard, and normally a comment like that would've made me doubt his feelings for me, but what I'd just felt was too powerful to deny.
 I could still see traces of desire in his eyes; and for the first time since I'd met him, I was absolutely positive he wasn't ever going to leave me.
 "I don't think it was a mistake.
 I want to kiss you again, but I'll behave."
 "You like the painting then?"
 I nodded, and then shivered.
 It's amazing how a near complete loss of physical control can burn through your energy reserves.
 Alec frowned.
 "I'm sorry.

They were also not being attacked, fighting with no opposition.
 And then I remembered what Chevelle had said.
 They would not kill the animals.
 As I laughed, the hawk screeched, and Chevelle and Steed glanced up at the sound.
 They were fighting, almost back to back, the bodies of councilmen strewn around them.
 I surveyed the land, searching for a stronger animal to jump to, something more harmful.
 I ran through my options‚Äîwhere was a quill pig when you needed it?‚Äîbut I wasn‚Äôt able to find anything near.
 Evidently the fight had cleared the mountain.
 All right, so it was just the hawk.
 And the horses.

"Don't you remember what we talked about?
 About how-how passionate kissing can lead to lovemaking?"
 "But Rick, can't we kiss at all?"
 He raised her hand to nibble on one delicate fingertip, trying to resist the nearly irresistible impulses that the frustrated desire in her eyes and voice stirred in him.
 "Not like we were tonight.
 Don't you understand, Marie?
 When our kisses get that hot, it's hard for me to stop.
 I don't want to stop.
 I want to make love to you."
 Her face grew fiery, and she was silent for a few seconds, staring down at her hands.

Alec was the next thing to go, but the memory of his features clung to my mind long after I found myself in a featureless void.
 Stranger still, his scent stayed with me even longer.
 I was just self-aware enough to hope I'd remember it all when I awoke in the morning.
 Chapter 5 It was a good thing I'd started school in the middle of the week.
 If I'd gone to school the next day after all the drama of learning about our mortgage problems I probably would have had a nervous breakdown.
 As it was, I was essentially worthless all weekend.
 I tried to warn Mom about the animals that'd mauled the kids from school, but she told me she was already aware of the incident and left before I could draw her into a discussion of what we should do about the bank.
 I saw her for maybe a total of three hours during the entire two days.
 Even I knew it was wasted effort.
 If Mom somehow beat the odds, it still wasn't going to result in the kind of money we'd need to save our house.

She enjoyed it so much that they got back in line and rode again.
 But as much as she enjoyed the "E.T."
 ride, it couldn't compare to the "Back to the Future" ride.
 That was really like flying--even more than in the airplane.
 It was more like having wings of her own, soaring high and low, below bridges and over mountains.
 "We really never left the ground?"
 she asked Rick as they waited to ride it a second time.
 "No.
 The car just jerks us around, and that combined with the effect of the picture makes you feel like you're flying."
 "Did you like it?"

Rachel cherishes her few remaining illusions.
 One of the most important is the pretense that nobody knows just how hard it is sometimes for her to be the only human in a house full of shape shifters."
 I felt my lips trembling, and he freed one of his hands to brush it lightly across my mouth.
 "You've been a godsend for her, Adri.
 As badly as it hurts each time she sneaks away, it hasn't happened nearly as often since you got here.
 She's been improving ever since you moved into town, and the rate of change has increased over the last two weeks."
 "I suppose we make quite the pair, her and I.
 Two shattered little dolls trying our best to make sure the pieces don't blow away and leave us with nothing.
 An imposition to everyone around us."
 He hugged me to him as he shook his head.

 She waved and then vanished into the forest.
 For a long time, Harruq remained.
 He ran a hand through his hair and pondered what in the abyss was wrong with him.
 ‚ÄúNever get involved with elves,‚Äù he mumbled.
 ‚ÄúNever ever should have gotten myself screwed up like this.‚Äù
 But a part of him liked it, and that scared him even more.

 He would burn for this.

 I was standing now, walking step for step toward him as he backed away.
 He said nothing, his face calm as the fire flared and I raised my hands to strike.
 And then everything went black.

And Debbie, well, she was just so young and lovely.
 The first time she took my cock out was in her backyard, leaning against her house, her mother moving around in the kitchen right over our heads‚Äîthis is what you did back then.
 Were parents oblivious?
 I don‚Äôt know.
 Anyway, she takes it out---and this is like the first time either of us has bared anything except our souls and she was just fascinated with it.
 And I don‚Äôt know where this knowledge comes from but she knew immediately how to do what needed to be done.
 She was jerking on me so expertly‚Äîwell, hell, maybe anything feels right the first time‚Äîand, very quickly‚ÄîI was young---I squirted all over both of us.
 It was a surprise.
 I don‚Äôt know what she expected to happen but there was this like fountain, as if I had stored it up for a decade, and there was some on her hand, her forearm, her shirt.
 And the look on her face (laughs) well, let‚Äôs just say, it was obvious that it was not what she expected.

I glanced around to find a village I didn‚Äôt know.
 Someone was coming toward me, an expression of fear and sadness on his handsome face.
 His familiar face.
 He reached out to me and I stepped toward him, tears streaming down my cheeks.
 He wrapped his arms around me as I turned again to see my mother.
 A howl of rage escaped her and I started to go to her, but he held me.
 He was restraining me.
 I thrashed against him as I tried to scream, to tell him to let me go, but I had no voice.
 She reached her hand out and I could not move, could not help her, though I knew she was dying.
 I was imprisoned there, unable to move‚Ä¶ unable to scream‚Ä¶ unable to save her.

After the exams, written and oral, Pam got euphoric and believed she couldn‚Äôt fail at anything.
 If she wanted to be a mom, she could do it.
 And, she said on account of my kids, it appeared I had good genes.
 So we decided to get to work.
 Mighty pleasant work, which we‚Äôre both apparently competent at.
 According to the pre-natal calculations, our little girl--Zo√´ Ada Fox Kuhlken--got conceived during the week after Pam‚Äôs last exam.
 All my adult life, I have worked to support other people.
 I don‚Äôt mind day jobs or sharing what I earn.
 But my day job performance suffers when my mind veers off to the stories I want to get home and write, and I suspect my stories could be richer, more passionate and imaginative, more intuitive and maybe inspired, if they didn‚Äôt always get interrupted by my day job.
 Sure, Franz Kafka was an office worker and William Blake a printer, but Kafka didn‚Äôt live very long and Blake had no kids.

They'd posted the cost of the tickets, and I'd been right.
 My paycheck wasn't going to cut it.
 I was still trying to decide whether or not to head back into the cafeteria, when the first bell rang, signaling a fitting end to a disappointment-filled lunch.
 History wasn't any better, and we had a sub for Physics.
 Alec actually walked into class, saw Mrs. Alexander wasn't there, and then turned around and left.
 It was possibly the most brazen act of class cutting I'd ever seen, and somehow it didn't surprise me in the least.
 Even so, I spent the rest of the hour stewing while working on the pointless, busywork assignment the sub handed out.
 Mrs. Tiggs still hadn't finished grading our tests, which meant I still had no idea how I'd done.
 By the time I finally half-collapsed at my normal table in the tutor lab, all I could think about was how nice it would be to see Brandon one more time as he drove me home.
 I looked around to verify that all of the usual suspects were there.

 I didn‚Äôt know what to do and Jason didn‚Äôt either.
 Emily ran forward and pointed to Seth who was clawing toward his weapon.
 ‚ÄúDo something!‚Äù she screamed.
 Before I could reply, fire shot from her finger.
 The thrasher yelped and jumped off Seth and ran toward Emily.
 She smiled wickedly and held both hands out, pelting the creature with fire.
 I pulled Seth up in time to see the Thrasher buried entangled by roots shooting from the dirt.
 Jason threw a knife in the pile to make sure it was really dead.
 ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù I asked Seth, and congratulated Emily on her new found talent.

We had been seven until Tom, whose last name I will keep to myself, disappeared on Friday night.
 Steve Havens had invited him along, because Tom was a lonely fellow and Steve was a churchgoing boy with an inclination toward good deeds.
 A half-hour into the trip we all, even Steve, regretted bringing Tom.
 All the way over the mountains, he had criticized us, for opening a window, calling for a pit stop, and choosing the wrong direction at a crossroads.
 In the desert he turned into a pyromaniac, pelted us with fiery sticks and blew one of our sleeping bags to shreds with cherry bombs.
 At last, a few of us chased him off into the night.
 In the morning, we couldn‚Äôt find the long crowbar we had brought for loosing boulders so we could roll them and watch them crash down the hillsides.
 We supposed Tom had stolen the crowbar and sold it to another camper then bummed a ride home.
 That Sunday morning, on the biggest and flattest of all the canyon‚Äôs boulders, Eric stood as though at a pulpit, arms outstretched as in the ‚ÄúJesus body picture‚Äù while he consulted our copy of Zarathustra and recited, ‚Äú‚ÄôMan is something that shall be overcome.
 You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm.

It was hard work.
 The horses had to be hand-led around rocks and trees and pulled up.
 Doi‚Äôvan and Rodregas had to manhandle the wagon around a few corners which was easier to do than it should have been, but Celestial and Hellborn strength together made short work of it.
 Then, as they finally started to level out into the small little valley of the hollow, the hair all over Rodregas‚Äô body suddenly stood up on end and his skin shivered.
 Rodregas was expecting it, but was a little shocked by the strength of his reaction.
 All those years ago he had had to struggle to feel it.
 Now he almost swayed in the currents of the magic stream of energy.
 The wagon halted as Doi‚Äôvan stopped pushing it up the incline.
 He just stood there, his wild black unkempt hair seeming to blow in an invisible wind.
 Imeralda looked equally surprised and caught up.

I finally oriented myself enough to realize that the warm, solid surface my back was resting against wasn't a wall.
 "I'm sorry.
 It was a nightmare."
 My voice came out raw and scratchy, like I'd been talking for hours, or possibly just screaming for the last minute or so.
 I wanted to tell him about what had happened, but now that I was awake my fears felt foolish.
 I tried to distract myself by looking around, and then felt my face heat up as I realized I'd fallen asleep in Alec's room.
 "I'm so sorry, Alec.
 Donovan and Rachel told me you had copies of our textbooks in here.
 I was studying and must have fallen asleep.
 Please don't think..." I felt tears start to gather at the corner of my eyes, but there wasn't any way to tell whether they were attributable to simple terror, acute embarrassment, or a combination of the two.

Alec, who I'd always figured had the depth of an old-style Mickey Mouse cartoon, had just faced down two older boys, and singlehandedly saved my Les Mis√©rables experience.
 Valjean launched into 'Who am I?
 ', and almost against my will I was pulled back around to where I could see the stage.
 Even as enthralled as I was by the music, I made a mental note to thank Alec after the performance.
 For once I wasn't going to try and get the best of him verbally, I was just going to walk up and thank him.
 The sense of being able to feel Alec behind me didn't diminish during the course of the play, if anything it gradually increased almost to the levels it'd been during the face-off with the college boys.
 Now though, it felt more reassuring than threatening.
 The rest of Les Mis√©rables was even better than I'd hoped.
 Minutes and seconds went by faster than at any other time in my life.
 As the curtain finally came down, I brushed away the traces of tears that'd appeared on my face during the performance, and turned in my seat as the lights came up.

 I'm not interested in seeing anyone."
 "I know you just broke up with Davis two days ago, but a family dinner--" "It has nothing to do with Davis.
 I just-I just want to be with my family for a while."
 The thought of being courted was revolting.
 Rick had said that they'd both eventually settle for someone else and get married, but she had no intention of marrying anyone else.
 She would never stop loving Rick.
 After breakfast Marie felt restless and agreed to her mother's suggestion that they go shopping.
 But they'd no sooner begun browsing through the first shop than she began feeling panicky.

His mind reeled with the implications and unreality of it all.
 And the emotion that permeated his jumbled thoughts was guilt.
 He'd been preoccupied with thoughts of Marie ever since he'd seen her picture.
 Was it possible that his thoughts had somehow brought her here?
 But even if that were true, how could he have known that thinking about someone would cause her to appear?
 He'd loved studying history in school, and Abraham Lincoln had never appeared.
 He scowled at the chicken as he took it from the oven.
 How was he going to help her get back?
 He didn't have much faith-- Marie's scream almost made him drop the chicken.
 Depositing the pan on the stove, he ran to the living room.

When we removed these window covers, we found broken panes behind them.
 The bedroom doors had been kicked in, and broken bongs and stem pipes, empty cigarette packs, matchbooks, just trash littered every surface.
 I don‚Äôt know what the hell these people (my son!)
 did in here, but the carpet could not have been dirtier if they raised farm animals indoors.
 Pictures of Brandon and his friends holding automatic weapons were nearly the only things upright.
 Sex toys filled the drawers and around his bed.
 Apparently, it had been a real bohemian festival at some point, at least to the people who hung here.
 Everything was broken or ajar, apparently ransacked while Brandon was in jail.
 Nearly all of his belongings that were worth anything were stolen by the scumbags who had been his peers.
 We heard Brandon‚Äôs girlfriend, Tiffanie, was afraid to return to the house while our son was in jail and it was probably the smartest thing she had done in years.

Jaime recently earned a Master of Arts degree from Perelandra College, which Pam and I founded about eight years ago, and which I essentially run.
 The college is one of the occupations that keeps me rushing around, the condition that originally clued me I should read Brother Lawrence.
 Pam and I believed God was asking us to found the college to make a place for people in general and Christians in particular who wanted to become writers to discover what they honestly believe, and to write with courage from their unique visions.
 Thinking of Jaime, I can‚Äôt begin to lament the virtually endless hurdles we've been called upon to jump in order to earn and maintain the college‚Äôs licensing, accreditation and the rest.
 Jaime's thesis is superb.
 A novella about a young woman whose Christian parents, when their daughter finds herself in extreme trouble, appear more concerned with remaining in accord with their church than with helping or even trying to understand their daughter.
 Its honesty touches my heart.
 Jaime and I spend a day roaming the city, with an hour stop at the Seattle Mystery Bookstore, which played a role in the final scene of Road Kill, an account of a book tour my friend Alan and I did together.
 At several of the tour stops, including Seattle and Portland, Mike Connelly joined us.
 Since then, Mike has become an international bestseller.

 I fought to stay focused on his face, so close.
 His eyes grew troubled and then he blurred out of vision as I went limp in his arms.

 ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou seem to have blacked out,‚Äù Chevelle said, a hint of some emotion under his reassurance.
 I blushed.
 He must have seen that coming, held me because of it, simply to prevent me from falling on my face.
 I was a fool.
 He helped me up, this time holding me only by one arm.
 I took a deep breath.

Alec looked back up at me, and his eyes were filled with incredible need.
 I was suddenly struck by the similarities to the me he'd painted, and what I saw written on his face.
 It seemed impossible he would be unsure, that a glorious being like him could ever need anything I could provide, but I couldn't deny it was there.
 There was no way of knowing what it was, but I didn't care.
 Whatever it was he needed I wanted to give him.
 I opened my mouth to say as much, but my vocal chords wouldn't cooperate.
 I was still trying to verbalize my feelings, when his free hand came down to my chin and gently pulled it up.
 My heart stuttered and threatened to quit as his lips slowly came down to meet mine.
 My only other experience had been so terrible that I nearly panicked, but before I could formulate a protest, or even decide if a protest was what I wanted, our flesh touched.
 The contact immediately drove every other thought from my mind.

"Lie down here with me and watch this `Mad About You' rerun."
 His arms went around her when she settled down beside him.
 She sighed and was instantly asleep.
 The last thing Rick remembered was Murray, the dog, drinking out of a toilet.
 When he opened his eyes again, the news was on.
 He yawned, wanting to stretch but finding that Marie lay on one arm.
 He looked down at her, smiling.
 Her cheeks were golden and rosy, her long, dark lashes like fans against them.
 Her dark hair fell over his arm and onto the pillow, and he reached up with his free hand to caress it.
 Marie stirred, moving closer to Rick.

 Some analysts of the record see things in it, which I‚Äôve heard you deny, yet, there does seem to be something underneath the surface of these songs, something darker.
 Dave Marsh described it as ‚ÄúMansonish deviltry mixed with Buffalo Springfield lyrics and Cream jams.‚Äù  It‚Äôs this Charlie Manson element that I‚Äôd like to hear you talk about, this school of thought that the record is some sort of coded message, a hint of what was to come, a gateway to the Apocalypse, according to Crawdaddy.

The big bathrobe almost reached her ankles, and she felt quite comfortable as she picked up her dress and wet clothing and went across the hall to the bedroom.
 She found hangers in the closet and hung her clothes there.
 But once she was in bed, the dreamlike feeling dissolved.
 She was far, far away from home, in a strange place, and she didn't know if she'd ever get back.
 Tears trickled down her cheeks as she drew her knees up under the covers, her back against the headboard.
 She was too frightened to go to sleep.
 Walking in the garden was no longer safe--was sleeping?
 Would she wake up to-- A knock at the door startled her.
 "Y-yes?"
 "Can I come in?"

She thought that they could just kiss forever.
 If only he could convince her to stay here with him.
 He was sure that she'd eventually come to accept the fact that she wasn't going to be able to get back home, but he was afraid they'd end up making love before she'd reached that point.
 And while making love on their wedding night would be a wonderful, earth-shattering experience for them both, he knew that making love before marriage would probably have disastrous results for her--and therefore for him.
 So he had to convince her to stay.
 And to marry him.
 Sighing, Rick rose and went to take a cold shower.
 Marie's door was closed, and the light was off, so he assumed she'd done as he'd suggested and gone to bed.
 Marie was in bed.
 Quietly crying into her pillow.

 He pulled out one of his healing potions, yanked off the cork, and forced the contents down Aurelia‚Äôs throat.
 The elf gagged, retching up half of it onto her neck and chest.
 Harruq got out his last potion but could not open it for the shaking of his hands.
 Desperate, he put it down, picked up one of his swords, and shattered the top of the vial.
 He flung the potion back to Aurelia‚Äôs mouth, nearly shredding her lower lip on the broken glass.
 More of the silvery-blue liquid poured down her throat.
 Harruq sat there, clutching her hands in his and waiting.
 The seconds crawled slower than the longest of years.

 I hadn't thought his expression could become anymore bittersweet.
 I was wrong.
 "Rachel doesn't have anyone either, but she's still suffering from a deeper hurt.

 My confusion must have been more than usually self-evident as I sat up.
 "No, Mother isn't going through a good episode.

 Rachel crept into her room and crawled into bed with her.
 It's a poor substitute for what she aches for, but it's all Mother can offer right now."

‚ÄúA wolf maybe?‚Äù Rodregas thought.
 It seemed to be watching the camp, but it was not doing anything aggressive.
 He remembered thinking he had seen an animal during the fight.
 ‚ÄúMaybe we were in a wolf pack‚Äôs territory, and they were just making sure that we were not disturbing their young,‚Äù he thought.
 Happily, this night proved to be more restful and peaceful then the last.
 CHAPTER 5 A PLACE OF PRIDE
 Rodregas drove the wagon with Imeralda sitting next to him; Doi‚Äôvan continued his impressive show of endurance by actually jogging next to the wagon and showing no trouble keeping up.
 As the trail was more of a hunting path than a proper road and they were traveling on an upward incline, the wagon was struggling to make much time.
 It was not until their midday stop that the three had any real conversation.

But the very motive which stimulated these achievements moderated them as well.
 For while these governments took concerted steps to meet the minimum needs of the population for food, they tended to overlook the equally great potential to utilize agriculture as an engine for economic growth and job creation.
 Once minimum food needs were met, attention was diverted to other sectors of the economy.
 Politically, the elimination of the famine threat arising from food shortages is one of the reasons for slower growth in agricultural productivity in recent years.
 This has resulted in a marked decline in investment by developing countries in government-sponsored agricultural research and rural techno-infrastructure.
 This tendency has been compounded by the false notion that in order to achieve economic growth, new jobs must be created in industry and services.
 Economic policy
 The resurgence of faith in the free market and liberalized trade has placed developing countries under increasing pressure from donors and international financial institutions to abandon special types of economic assistance to the agricultural sector in the form of subsidies for supply of critical inputs such as fertilizer and seeds and price supports for marketable crops.
 This pressure has recently been aggravated by the impact of structural adjustment programmes that usually involve drastic reduction in government subsidies.
 In Ghana, for instance, the cost of fertilizer as a percentage of total cultivation cost has risen ten-fold in recent years.

A voice hissed, ‚ÄúWe will show him.‚Äù This was seriously starting to freak me out.
 It was like the dead were talking to me, and I shivered.
 Then I saw them.
 They slithered from the shadows of the trees and bushes.
 There hundreds of them, each easily my height.
 They were covered in black, grey green scales that were each the size of my hand.
 They were layered on its body like plated armor.
 Their beady dark, red eyes sent shivers down my spine.
 I slung my bow back over my shoulder and grabbed my hunter's knife from its sheath on my side.
 One stopped and raised its head up towards me.

And his whispering voice either sounds too much like my own to be surely authentic, or else it‚Äôs so soft, I‚Äôm not often sure I heard right.
 The Jesus I used to picture looked like a young Max Von Sydow in The Greatest Story Ever Told, and his expressions appeared more posed or acted than honestly human.
 But now he's beginning to look more like Eric.
 Eric possessed by Jesus, I can adore.
 I still see him.
 I can watch the lines of his face change as I tell him about my fears or longings.
 I can hear him speak thoughtful words.

I didn't want to talk to her.
 What I really wanted to do was enjoy the short immunity fainting usually granted me.
 For a minute or so I could think about Dad and Cindi with impunity.
 I think Mom had figured that out though.
 Nothing I'd tried recently had been equal to the task of getting her to leave me alone, or at least in silence, right after an episode.
 She was probably worried I'd go back to how I was immediately after it all happened.
 I'd lost a couple of weeks there, alternately triggering a panic attack and then thinking about Dad or Cindi until the immunity wore off and another attack ensued.
 Mom had flipped out.
 I'm not sure what brought me out of that black hole.
 I think maybe it was when I looked out the window one day and realized I'd somehow missed fall.

In that case there might actually be another room behind the forth wall that we simply don‚Äôt have a connection to and therefore cannot sense.‚Äù The others nodded.
 Rodregas thought that they were heading along the right path.
 Imeralda asked, ‚ÄúDoes that mean that in this room these are great sigils as well?
 Ones that require Infernal sourced magic to work?
 That kind of makes sense if you can have greater sigils that are the shapes of the Celestial Beasts.
 Why not daemons of the Infernal Realm as well?
 But what is the One Tree?
 It is not a beast of a realm, it is the symbol of the Nymph people.
 It can‚Äôt be a sigil, can it?‚Äù she asked.
 Neither Doi‚Äôvan nor Rodregas answered and the three of them stood there, each caught up in their own thoughts.

The next morning I woke to the sound of rock against rock.
 There was no sign of Chevelle or his horse in the dim stone hollow.
 I sat up, rubbing my sore legs, unable to believe he‚Äôd left me.
 And then the rock wall struck me in the face.
 I cursed, my voice hoarse from sleep.
 The wall came at me again.
 ‚ÄúOkay, okay,‚Äù I shouted.
 ‚ÄúLet me up.‚Äù Chevelle‚Äôs camouflage dissipated and he stared down at me, disappointed.
 I smirked.
 ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your horse?‚Äù He smiled as the beast nipped at the back of my head, yanking my hair.

Snap!
 Snap!
 She was faster now, cracking the whip above me and at each side, moving again and again, closer and closer.
 I had to think of something but my mind could only concentrate on the snap of her whip.
 Her boots splashed in the melted snow again, and I sent the icy water racing up under the material of her skirt to her bare legs.
 Shock crossed her face and I hoped it would buy the time I needed.
 What now?
 The cold water had thrown her for no more than a fraction of a second, but it was enough time to right myself and execute one quick attack.
 I volleyed a nearby rock, which struck her in the back of the head and threw her balance off for another instant.
 I knew I was larger than her so I gritted my teeth and lunged, grabbing her as I tried to figure my next move.

Rick joined her in the kitchen.
 "How about this one?"
 He was wearing a plain blue t-shirt.
 "Yeah."
 She leaned close, inhaling.
 Then she raised her face to nuzzle his neck.
 "You put on fresh cologne."
 "I wanted to be sure I had on enough for the t-shirt to absorb it."
 She kissed his neck.
 "Do you want me to heat up the food?"

His lips were warm, and they had the slightest hint of softness, but there was more urgency and fierceness to the kiss than expected.
 It wasn't as amazing as I'd fantasized, but I was still having a hard time thinking.
 I tried to pull back and catch my breath, but his arms had become steel cables that pulled me in tighter.
 Fear finally overcoming my desire not to look stupid.
 I started to push away from Brandon.
 My efforts seemed futile for several seconds, and then his right arm released me.
 He wasn't letting me go though, his right hand had just repositioned to my stomach while his left arm kept me pinned against him almost as tightly as both hands had just a second before.
 It should have been obvious what he had in mind, but it wasn't until his hand was under my shirt and moving upwards that my overloaded mind caught up with events.
 I tried to protest, tried harder to push myself away from him, but he just held onto me tighter than even before.
 His hand was just millimeters away from its target, and I was starting to see stars from lack of air, before I finally remembered some of the tricks my dad had shown me.

Father has increased my work periods to every other day.
 Combined with my other duties, I am stationed in the castle almost all week.
 The magic practice exhausts me or I would sneak out at night, the way I enjoyed as a child.
 It doesn‚Äôt seem fair.
 My sister is practically ignored.
 Father clearly prefers me, but sometimes I wonder if that is really better.
 She wanders idly around the castle, no practice, no duties, no formal gatherings.
 Magic practice, castles, who was this girl?
 I read the entries for hours.
 Ruby must have thought I was sleeping.

Chevelle gave me no answers and though hers were sometimes cryptic, I knew she‚Äôd been reading books on magic.
 ‚ÄúRuby, is there a way to harness the power of things‚Ä¶ like that waterfall?‚Äù Grey glanced at me.
 The look of concern for my intelligence was not exactly uncommon, but it was something I could never quite get used to.
 ‚ÄúNot that I know of,‚Äù she said.
 She got her mischievous grin then.
 ‚ÄúThough I did read once that there was a way to steal life force and use it for yourself.‚Äù Chevelle shot her a stern rebuke from the front of the pack.
 She continued as if excusing herself, ‚ÄúBut it was merely a fairy‚Äôs tale and probably not entirely accurate.‚Äù Then, in a lower voice, ‚ÄúIt is fun to speculate, though.‚Äù I wiped at my cheek to clear the dampness from the mist, mirroring her low tone as I questioned her.
 ‚ÄúHow would you steal life force?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, like I said, probably not accurate‚Ä¶ but you would have to take the other‚Äôs life in order to gain their power.
 Take it in a specific manner.‚Äù She noticed Chevelle glaring at her and clamped her mouth shut.
 I waited until he turned back around before I whispered, ‚ÄúRuby, did you bring the magic book with you?‚Äù She smiled.

My head was still spinning as Alec offered me his arm and led me out of the room.
 There was a limo, easily the largest vehicle I'd ever seen, waiting for us outside.
 We piled into it with plenty of room to spare.
 The bar was fully stocked, but Alec shook his head at Rachel when she made as if to reach for a drink.
 Nobody else seemed even the slightest bit interested in the prospect of alcohol.
 Rachel sat back with a pout and then turned and whispered in my ear.
 "Stupid shape shifters.
 None of them can get drunk, so they deprive the rest of us of the best parts of being young and stupid."
 Once we arrived at the park, I did my best to pretend obliviousness to all of the gasps and stares as we trickled out of the limo.
 It was a good thing Alec had such a steady arm, it was all I could do not to stumble as I took in the transformation that'd taken place.

In a moment, my crack-berry starts to blow up with one call after the next from Ashley, wanting to know when we are doing this deal.
 I must keep buying time with excuses, now nearing a two-hour delay waiting for the cops to come from the other bust.
 It is looking like this deal is not going to happen either.
 I answer some of the calls and ignore others as I am instructed to do by Officer White.
 I whisper in one call as if I can‚Äôt talk because I am still stuck at home with my wife and cannot talk freely.
 I reassure Ashley that I will meet her as soon as I can get out.
 I think of my wife and son at home wondering why I haven‚Äôt called; is it over?
 Am I dead?
 Finally the crew is all present behind the store, and the review of protocol and procedure began as it did before.
 New officers are in amongst familiar faces from the prior attempt.

In Agenda for Peace, the UN Secretary General has recommended broadening the peace-making, peace-keeping and peace-enforcing capabilities of the UN by establishing a standing UN military force.
 With the end of bipolar confrontation within the Security Council, this proposal is practicable and should be acted upon immediately by establishing a strong permanent force drawn from 20 to 30 member states, trained and equipped for rapid deployment.
 Such a force, if established, is likely to be relatively small, however, and unequal to the task of dealing with threats from a major army equipped with sophisticated weapons.
 In addition, its deployment would always be subject to veto by any of the five permanent members of the Council.
 For both these reasons, it cannot constitute a reliable mechanism for guaranteeing the security of UN member countries.
 Although a strengthening of the UN‚Äôs peace-keeping capabilities is highly desirable, it cannot serve as an adequate foundation for a cooperative security system unless the UN‚Äôs political structure is radically modified.
 Because it is essentially an addition to national forces rather than a substitute for them, funding will be a perennial difficulty and there will be strong resistance to its expansion on economic grounds.
 Furthermore, as recent events have demonstrated, nations contributing their forces will have a strong propensity to resist their active deployment in situations that involve significant risks.
 Even after the Security Council decided to send a peace-keeping force into Rwanda for strictly humanitarian purposes, none of the leading military powers, with the exception of France, were willing to contribute the modest amount of military equipment urgently needed to protect UN troops.
 Similar efforts are in various stages of maturity for establishing standing international forces at the regional level in Western Europe, Latin America and other places as part of collective security arrangements.

Rodregas could not figure out any set pattern to the place or its boundaries.
 There might have been a dozen or even hundreds of Nymphs living there.
 Though all the Nymphs were friendly, he was still eager to leave.
 Jordaan was doing one of his mystic checks, running his hand a foot above Rodregas‚Äô reclining body.
 Occasionally, his hand seemed to be moving in the air like a baker making bread.
 ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Rodregas finally said, ‚ÄúI feel fine now and I thank you for your healing, but I think I am ready to leave.‚Äù Jordaan nodded.
 His face held his usual expression of good cheer.
 ‚ÄúYour body heals fast and is a fascinating medium to work with.‚Äù A cloud went over his smile when he added, ‚ÄúYour body and spirit were not in very good alignment and your connection to the world was terribly fractured.
 Truly, it has been more effort to fix your spiritual wounds than your physical ones.‚Äù Jordaan‚Äôs smile returned when he added, ‚ÄúWhile true healing takes a lifetime of both inner and outer work, you are physically healthy enough to be on your way.
 And while I enjoy the challenge of working on your enhanced body, your presence too long among us will bring danger down to us.‚Äù Rodregas nodded, but asked, ‚ÄúAnd Doi‚Äôvan, is he healthy enough to travel and fight if needed?‚Äù ‚ÄúHe needs to let go of some of his anger and learn to focus on his inner self, but his physical wounds are healed.‚Äù Rodregas paused.

 He felt within himself a lifewell of energy, one infinitely deep.

While the sun was still a sliver peeking over the horizon, Aurelia shook Harruq‚Äôs shoulders to wake him.
 She then sat back and put her hands to her forehead while the half-orc tried to remember where he was.

 He sat on his rear and began readjusting his armor to his more slender frame.
 ‚ÄúIn time,‚Äù she said.
 ‚ÄúI have met him only once, but I doubt there are any like him.
 Stay quiet and be patient.‚Äù
 Her mind was a net, and she cast it further and further out, scanning the rolling hills and the plains beyond.

"It's after the dance.

 I was suddenly even more grateful we were going to the dance together.
 If I only had a couple of weeks to live, then I wanted to spend every possible second with him.
 Chapter 27 I groaned as Alec circled two of my biology essays and handed them back to me.
 "You're doing much better, but you're missing a couple of key components here and here."
 "Has anyone ever told you you're a brutal taskmaster?"
 His smile took away some of the sting over just how careful he was being not to touch me lately.
 It was like he had a split personality.
 When he was thinking about it, he was ultra-careful not to do anything to deepen the Ja'tell bond.

 CHAPTER THIRTEEN
 Tears were streaming down Marie's cheeks when the fog began to lift.
 She was in her own garden.
 She ran to her house, tearing open the door and dashing upstairs.
 She paused at her room long enough to toss her bag onto her bed and then dashed to her parents' room.
 "Mother!

 She banged on the door.
 The door opened, and her father stared at her in shock.

They are all worthy, but there can be only one new knight this day.‚Äù Faurrenida looked around slowly catching each of them by the eye.
 Rodregas was caught up in the commanding presence of the man.
 ‚ÄúTo the Order and to the Celestials!‚Äù his voice was half command and half prayer.
 Everyone including combatants and those watching from wall and window responded, so that the words swirled around the arena.
 ‚ÄúTo the Order and to the Celestials!‚Äù This time the Grand Marshal seemed to look around at all the spectators until finally he nodded, satisfied.
 Without another word he strode out.
 Imeralda followed him as did all the squire‚Äôs attendants.
 It was time for the final match.
 Rodregas left his shield and mace relaxed at his side and strode over to Nordien, who stood with shield and mace at the ready.
 Instead of attacking he asked the big man, ‚ÄúSo, are people right, do you plan to serve the Immortalists if you gain the greater sigil?‚Äù The squire looked around a little confused.

 This seemed to disturb him.
 He avoided pacing near me the rest of the evening, throwing me odd glances now and again.

Rick covered her mouth with his again, his kiss so hot and thorough and demanding that it elicited more moans from her.
 He ended the embrace with a series of quick, hard kisses and then eased his hold on her, panting.
 Marie started to reach for him again, but then her eyes narrowed.
 Pushing against his chest so hard that he stumbled back, she whirled and stormed off into the fog.
 How dare he!
 How dare he use his kisses to try to keep her from going home!
 It was already hard enough just to look at him in the morning before she walked in the garden.
 He knew that whenever they kissed, she didn't want to stop, that she'd kiss him forever.
 Just last night he'd told her that they couldn't kiss like that unless they got married.
 And this morning he dared to kiss her that way, knowing that it would make her all but forget her walk!

Through keen eyes I watched below, surveying a massive structure of dark stones.
 Then I was a wolf, running through those stones, hunting, searching, protecting.
 My muscular shoulders tensed and released with each long stride.
 I was myself again, though strong and confident.
 Two statuesque elves, twinned in white, glided past me.
 Lightning struck around me, cracking the dark stones of the walls.
 Reed of Keithar Peak stood before me and suddenly I was on a pedestal, looking down as he wagged his tongue at me.
 I scorned him, burning a chunk of it off, and he smiled.
 I jolted awake, the smell of burning flesh still lingering in my senses, and was staring at Ruby‚Äôs ceiling.
 Curse her.

Similar efforts are in various stages of maturity for establishing standing international forces at the regional level in Western Europe, Latin America and other places as part of collective security arrangements.
 The limitation of these proposals, like that of NATO and the erstwhile Warsaw Pact, is that they are fundamentally exclusive in nature and could easily become competitive with other forces as the East and West blocs have in the past.
 The strong resentment voiced by Russia at the proposal that some Eastern European nations would join NATO illustrates the danger of expanding exclusive military clubs.
 For NATO to overcome these legitimate concerns, it would have to be thrown open to all nations that seek to join and abide by its charter.
 The great reluctance of the West to shoulder the burden of responsibility for security enforcement in Eastern Europe under a widened NATO umbrella highlights the basic inadequacy of exclusive blocs for meeting global security needs.
 If the structural limitations of the UN cannot be immediately overcome, the alternative would be to build a cooperative security mechanism in parallel with the UN but structured along more democratic lines similar to NATO.
 A World Army could consist of an international peace force that would unconditionally guarantee the security of its members against external aggression based on the following provisions:
 Membership in the World Army would be voluntary and open to all countries, provided that they have and maintain democratic, multi-party political systems.
 Since membership is not exclusive, it could be merged at any time with other like-minded organizations such as NATO, or be integrated into a UN military force when the necessary changes in UN political structure have been made.
 As a condition for membership, each country would by legal enactment forego war as an instrument of policy and undertake not to commit any act of external aggression against any other member or non-member for any reason whatsoever.

So he had to convince her to stay.
 And to marry him.
 Sighing, Rick rose and went to take a cold shower.
 Marie's door was closed, and the light was off, so he assumed she'd done as he'd suggested and gone to bed.
 Marie was in bed.
 Quietly crying into her pillow.
 ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~
 Marie dressed quickly, hoping she could get to the garden before Rick woke up.
 She didn't know how she could look him in the eye this morning.
 She'd been so hurt last night when he'd refused to kiss her and told her to go to bed, but now she was embarrassed when she thought about how she'd pleaded with him to keep kissing her.

 "Heated in the microwave oven?"

 She began yawning as she finished her chocolate.
 She looked at Rick with sudden concern.

 Oh, it was going to get really interesting.
 The ground rumbled and we both stopped dead.

 I had no desire to become separated again.
 ‚ÄúWhen can‚Äôt you use sarcasm?‚Äù I asked loudly.
 He didn‚Äôt reply to me because he had spotted Emily.
 She was slowly backing up with her palms out.
 Fire danced from her fingertips and twisted towards the troll and frost beast.
 The beast breathed and ice sprayed from its mouth.
 Emily moved her hand over and the ice evaporated into mist.
 She was holding up fine but I didn‚Äôt know how much longer.
 I strung my bow and released an arrow.

His angle was wrong, Rodregas felt like he was standing on a crate.
 ‚ÄúShould I order the birthday celebration milord?‚Äù asked the captain.
 The coming celebration had been the talk of speculation for months as well as the object of more than a little betting among the guards.
 Rodregas nodded, his thoughts swirling as he realized that he could use the celebration to his benefit.
 Without looking at the captain he walked toward the stairway, and the captain followed close behind him.
 At the door Rodregas took a deep breath and said, ‚ÄúCaptain, that ceremony did not go smoothly, but the gods once again proved to favor me, and I wish to be generous with the birthday ceremony.
 Tell the purser to pay everyone an extra month‚Äôs wages today and give everyone a week off to spend as they wish.
 Make sure you tell Purser Stevents to be generous.
 I want all staff rewarded, even the kitchen drudges.‚Äù He finished, hoping it did not sound as halting and made up as he knew it to be.
 ‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù replied Captain Poir, his expression going from a guarded concern to enthusiasm.

All I can tell you is, when I woke up in his arms this morning, I jumped out of his clutches and ran straight to here.
 You want to go home with me after the shift?
 If he‚Äôs still hanging around, maybe you can chase him off.‚Äù By now, Helga was wringing her hands.
 Her eyes had misted over.
 She was about as bright as the girls in blonde jokes.
 But she was a darling, generous and kind.
 So when she invited us to a Billy Graham crusade, to keep from disappointing her, and maybe for deeper reasons, I said ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù Neither Cliff nor I admitted we might want to attend.
 We decided we could read a newspaper account and tell Helga we had gone and found plenty to think about.
 But by the evening of the crusade, something like conscience bit us.
 The crusade was downtown at Balboa Stadium, where the Chargers played.

He'd forestalled my next excuse as if reading my mind.
 "There isn't anything wrong with letting someone help you.
 Sometimes a helping hand is exactly what's called for."
 The memory had a vividness that'd been lacking lately.
 It was the same aching realism that'd devoured nearly a month of my existence before I finally decided I had to try and go on with my life, for Mom's sake if for no other reason.
 I panicked when I realized just how badly I wanted to slip back into that twilight world where nothing hurt, where it didn't matter if people liked me or not.
 The one where I still had all three of the most important people in my world.
 The fear that I'd give in, that I'd end up in a hospital during the day or two it took Mom to realize I hadn't made it home from school, pulled me back sooner than normal.
 For a second my mind inhabited a body that wouldn't obey any of the normal commands.
 Fear snaked out from my center when my eyes wouldn't open, but before my heart could really start accelerating, my eyelids started functioning again.

she exclaimed, taking her baja from the bag.

 "This is fun.

 Marie loved bargaining, but the only other thing she saw that she wanted was a little glass carousel that she managed to get from ten dollars down to five.
 "Can't we eat here somewhere, Rick?
 I'd like to try the food."
 "No, you wouldn't," he said as they approached customs.
 "The water down here is contaminated.

She agreed and said she would see me soon.
 After I hung up the phone, the officer called me on my personal cell phone, which I was answering from a headset in my ear.
 He offered some encouraging words about how I had handled her attempt to move me and said they would try to move me again because Steve was not going to want to meet me in this county because of his arrangement with the police here.
 We were only a mile from another county line so Officer White and his team felt he would try to get me to move that mile.
 I hung up and the wait began.
 I was all eyes and all ears as the silence in the truck made it too easy for my mind to wander.
 I wasn‚Äôt allowed any background noise.
 I was parked at the far end of the lot with the front end of my truck against a fence as I was instructed to do.
 I was impatiently waiting when I finally saw one of the scraggly dressed officers wandered by pushing a grocery basket full of bags looking like a homeless person.
 He had an old torn jacket on with a beanie on his head.

Rodregas felt he owed them, and if he had been in their place he would have tried to kill Ravenhurr.
 Clearly the three human men were eager to get started back to the main road.
 He noticed that the Hellborn Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda seemed to be hanging back.
 As the three men started to head down the road Doi‚Äôvan walked up to Rodregas and stated, ‚ÄúI would rather travel with you.‚Äù That was it; he just stood there like some huge tree after that simple statement.
 Audrian seemed as surprised as he was.
 They both spoke at the same time, their thoughts strangely in agreement.
 ‚ÄúAre you crazy?‚Äù asked Audrian at the same time as Rodregas said, ‚ÄúThat is crazy.‚Äù ‚ÄúLook, the Guild will be after me,‚Äù Rodregas stated.
 ‚ÄúIt will not be safe to travel in my company,‚Äù he added.
 ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù stated the Hellborn in a voice that was so deep it was like stones grinding.
 ‚ÄúBut still, I would travel with you.‚Äù Again he made the statement and showed no interest in explaining his action.

 He had seen what she was doing, knew her motives most likely, but I could tell he thought it had worked.
 He thought I was jealous.
 Perfect.

So Bob and I head out for a day of whacking golf balls into the marshes beneath some snowcapped peaks across the Columbia River in Washington.
 Because Portland‚Äôs main attractions are its brewery pubs, after golf we stop at one of them.
 On two of the too many televisions is the women‚Äôs college softball World Series.
 I watch the pitchers, studying their moves.
 Zo√´ is a softball pitcher too.
 She was the ace of her eight and under team.
 The season just ended a few weeks ago.
 For a project in her second grade class, she wrote and illustrated a book, which her teacher bound, entitled The Fast Friendly Pitcher‚Äôs Bad Remembering Day.
 I suppose if I live another thirty years, my eyes will still mist when I think of my girl as the fast friendly pitcher.

Its diameter had been drawn as large as possible within the limitations of the roof‚Äôs edges.
 On the inside were sigils, runes, and small candles set out every few feet.
 Rodregas knew enough of magic to understand that the purpose of this circle was to keep out unwanted magical influences.
 They could interfere with the spell casting inside the circle.
 Also, the circle would hold in any magical forces inside which someone wanted to store or manipulate.
 Inside the large circle were four smaller circles.
 Rodregas‚Äô eyes immediately went to the one on the north side made of blue sand, where inside sigils made of a yellow waxy substance laid a giant lion.
 This was not a normal lion such as those found in the nearby forest, but a giant beast.
 Ravenhurr had been lucky indeed.
 He had been able to buy several Dire Cats from the Immortalist Guild dealer Taiga.

The sun hadn‚Äôt set when I‚Äôd finished lining the floor with vines, but I went ahead and settled in, sitting so I could see through an opening in the frond-covered entry.
 It was quiet, harder to fight the thoughts that were trying to creep in.
 I began to run songs through my head for distraction, mangling the lyrics and humming through the parts I couldn‚Äôt remember at all.
 My fingers tapped soundlessly into the dirt, until a flicker of movement just outside stopped me.
 I held my breath for what I was sure was impending, and painful, death, and saw it again.
 I released the breath, which was not, in fact, my last.
 A soft white rabbit loped in front of the bushes I‚Äôd posted for a doorway.
 My stomach was interested, but I‚Äôd never prepared meat.
 I‚Äôd only ever gathered berries and vegetables that someone else had grown.
 I didn‚Äôt have the first idea how to make a bow, let alone shoot one, and I‚Äôd never killed anything.

 And several paintings are on display.

 Every action, every kill, seemed to confirm the words of his brother.
 He was a killer and nothing more.
 His legacy would be one of death and emptiness.
 The ghosts of the village clung to his back and neck.

See that coming and, walloped by dread reality, spooked beyond reach of old customs and authority, our nature cries, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs out there somewhere, whatever it is.
 Go find it.‚Äù Eric and I bought Kerouac‚Äôs On the Road, and checked out Dharma Bums and his latest, Big Sur, a memoir in minimal disguise, about a fellow who goes to a cabin in the forest to recover from drunkenness and fame.
 Imagine Henry David Thoreau as a neurotic who returns to Walden Pond and finds psychosis awaiting him there.
 Still, we concluded that a poet of Kerouac's passion and skill, who could make a hangover feel romantic, would pull out of his tailspin and rise again.
 That fall, Eric and I read most every day, then sat in my backyard or on a beach or sea cliff and talked for hours at a spell.
 Also, we worked at odd jobs, sold some possessions, and saved most of whatever our moms gave us.
 We needed gas money, so we could chase visions of Kerouac and his Beat pals through the places they haunted at the west end of their cross-country odysseys.
 Twice that fall, the minute school let out on Friday, we sped north on Highway 101.
 From Morro Bay to Santa Cruz, we followed the coast and made camp for the night on a cliff between Hearst Castle and Big Sur.
 Saturday, midmorning, we landed in North Beach, San Francisco.

 ‚ÄúI think.‚Äù ‚ÄúYup, we just follow a bunch of monsters that would like to smash us to pulp and serve us for dinner,‚Äù Seth said and started to slide down the side of the hill.
 ‚ÄúBrilliant idea.‚Äù I followed him down, feeling the grass and dirt scrape the bottom of my leg.
 My pants started to scrunch up causing this slide to be very annoying.
 I decided to ignore it because I had my bow in my hands and had more important things to worry about.

Then, warning him to be ready, she dropped down one of the fruits which he caught with his normal grace.
 ‚ÄúStay on the root,‚Äù she warned him.
 ‚ÄúYou cannot take one of the blessings off the tree; it will wither and die if you try.‚Äù She winked at Rodregas as she said this.
 Imeralda then proceeded to eat the acorn shaped fruit; it took some work.
 It seemed to be a bit harder than any ripe fruit Rodregas knew of, but he followed her example and found that while it was tart it was amazing.
 It tasted of... Rodregas did not know what to call the flavor; the words that came to mind were sunlight and rain and the smell of a forest at night.
 When Rodregas finished the fruit completely he felt more whole but was also sad that it was gone.
 Imeralda seemed in great humor.
 ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù she said.
 She dropped to her hands on the edge of the branch and then dropped down as if she was only feet from the ground which, strangely she was.

If Britney drove all the way out here and I was already gone because I'd taken the bus, she was going to be really mad.
 On the other hand, if she didn't show, I had no other way to get to school, and Mom would freak out.
 Part of the reason she felt like she could be gone so much ever since the accident was the fact that I always did the responsible thing.
 If she started thinking I was cutting class, she was going be furious.
 It would be like I was behaving irresponsibly and taking away her ability to pursue her art, all at the same time.
 It was past time for the bus to arrive, and she still wasn't here.
 A car zipped around the corner driving way too fast, just like Britney always did, but it wasn't white.
 I looked past it, hoping to see another one following it.
 My mouth nearly hit the ground when I recognized the throaty roar and dark paint job of Brandon's Mustang.
 "I knew you'd be sitting here worrying she wouldn't come."

Or a premonition.
 Or, for all I know, I might have briefly died.
 The spell broke and left me sprawled in the Desert Inn.
 I lay still a while, sore all over, with a throbbing skull, wishing to go back to heaven.
 Then I got up, swallowed a few aspirin, and roused Eric to tell him about my adventure.
 ‚ÄúI was on one side of a bottomless gorge, looking across at this forest of evergreens and fruit trees, with all the colors so bright they looked lighted from inside.
 The forest was on an endless slope.
 There wasn‚Äôt any horizon.
 And the music, each note contained all kinds of harmonies, all at once.
 And the instruments sounded like giant bells, big as mountains, far away.‚Äù Eric had sat up.

All nations should advise the Secretary General of the human, technological and produc tive resources they are willing and able to place at the disposal of the UN.
 2.Each government should draw up an inventory of its military manpower, science, technology and other facilities which could be used to sustain the natural resource base, prevent environmental degradation and cooperate with other countries in combating regional and global threats to environmental security.
 The information should be shared with the UN Environmental Programme and the Sustain able Development Council.
 In each case it will be necessary to show how action implemented by the military will be more cost-effective than using traditional resources.
 3.A UN International Force for Development should be constituted under a democratized UN structure, consisting of demobilized military personnel and young professionals from different countries, which will be trained and equipped to promote people-centred, environmentally sound development initiatives that integrate political, social, economic and cultural factors.
 4.Global security is threatened by mass population movements, potential changes in sea levels, drought and famine.
 Greater international cooperation is needed in the sharing of national military manpower, under the auspices of a new UN Earth corps.
 Article 43 of the UN Charter, which was originally drawn up for dealing with the threat of conventional war, can be interpreted to apply to threats to environmental security as well.
 In parallel to a UN Earth corps, national Earth corps units should be constituted to operate within each state and for service internationally under the UN.
 Vocational skills imparted through these agencies will be of subsequent use to the community at large.

Her steps lead straight to the grave.‚Äù Reba laughed and sat in the chair between Cliff and me.
 She arched her back so her breasts swelled.
 ‚ÄúHelga, last night I took your advice.
 I said, ‚ÄòGod, help me out here.
 Don‚Äôt let temptation lure me down to the Inn Spot again.‚Äô‚Äù Helga beamed, and leaned across the table.
 ‚ÄúYou stayed home?
 Tell me you stayed home?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, I stayed home all right, but that‚Äôs not the whole story.
 You see, the devil came for me.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Helga covered her face with both hands and peeked out.
 ‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam.
 He came right up and knocked on my door.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut you didn‚Äôt let him in?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, I wasn‚Äôt going to, but one look at that hunk of a man, and he got me in his spell.

Chevelle approached during his pacing and I slid the book into my pack, pretending to examine the beading on the material of the dress.
 This seemed to disturb him.
 He avoided pacing near me the rest of the evening, throwing me odd glances now and again.

Education is the process by which society passes on the accumulated knowledge and experience of countless centuries to new generations in a systematic, concentrated and abridged form, so that today‚Äôs young people can start their lives at the high point of knowledge and wisdom attained by preceding generations.
 Education replaces the slow, subconscious process of trial and error learning with a swift, conscious process.
 This accumulated knowledge is a great power that can be utilized to accelerate human development and abridge the time needed for society to arrive at progressively higher levels of material, social and psychological fulfilment.
 Despite the massive efforts of international institutions to create awareness of the vital role of education in peace, democracy, economic development, population control and environmental protection, progress on extending the benefits of education to all humankind is still grossly inadequate.
 In 1990, 948 million people or about 20 per cent of the entire world population lacked even basic literacy skills.
 Adult literacy rates in the least developed nations still average less than 50 per cent and are less than half that in a number of countries.
 Unless more intensive efforts are made, worldwide the absolute number of the illiterate will decline only marginally by the year 2000.
 Illiteracy is likely to increase by 10 per cent in South Asia ‚Äì home to more than 40 per cent of the world‚Äôs illiterate ‚Äì and by nearly 7 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa.
 Although universal primary education has been a goal for decades and primary education has been made compulsory in most countries, 128 million children living in remote rural areas, urban slums and refugee camps ‚Äì representing 20 per cent of the total school-age population ‚Äì are still excluded from primary education.
 Unless greater measures are introduced, this number may rise to more than 160 million by the turn of the century.

I nodded and smiled, surprised that the thought of so much time trapped in a car with someone didn't make me want to run away screaming.
 Cars were scary.
 All that time with nothing to do but talk, and once you started talking to people they wanted to know things.
 Things that weren't any of their business, things you weren't ready to discuss.
 Somehow I knew Rachel wouldn't pry.
 It was like keeping so many secrets for her brother had made her especially sensitive to other people's secrets.
 Another few steps brought us to the door, and I held it open for Rachel to follow me outside.
 The intense heat felt like a physical blow.
 I could almost feel my pores open up in an effort to keep me from overheating.
 The sensory overload as my eyes tried to adjust to the unfiltered afternoon sun momentarily distracted me.

A small scream escaped.
 My arms were covered in tree bark, blending seamlessly with the stump on which I sat.
 I bolted upright, batting at them as if my shirt were on fire.
 Chevelle and the cloaked woman ran toward me and I looked up in panic.
 When my eyes fell again to my arms, they were normal.
 Had I imagined it?
 Was I losing my mind?
 My head came up once more, and the woman gasped.
 It was Junnie.
 Her cloak had fallen, her golden curls a welcome sight.

 "I really did want to kiss you.
 I couldn't have gotten that look on my face if I hadn't wanted to kiss you."
 He drew her closer.
 "Prove it."
 "How?"
 "Kiss me."

Given the right leadership, we can change the course, amend the rules, alter the structures and accelerate action to achieve an entirely different and more favourable set of outcomes.

 At least if Brandon's pack does come after us there, we're within our rights to do something about it."
 I opened my mouth to comment on the fact that Brandon's pack was roughly twice the size of ours, only to realize that scurrying back home kind of precluded continuing to help out at the tutor lab.
 "What about helping Mrs.
 Campbell?"
 It shouldn't have surprised me that Alec thought it over for several seconds before shaking his head.
 Whatever else he was, he wasn't the thoughtless jerk Brandon had proven himself to be.
 "I'm sorry, Adriana.

 Fewer witnesses means more chance Brandon's people will try to arrange for something to happen.

Want to crash at my place?‚Äù Emily flipped open her phone, her fingers danced on the keys and paused.
 Then they clicked and she shoved it in her pocket.
 ‚ÄúYup I can.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always one step ahead.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlways.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo what do you think we should do?‚Äù Emily asked from my bed later on.

I'd seen plenty of fights where the guy who got the first hit in won.
 Vincent was going to throw the first punch, and then Isaac was going to go down like a house of cards.
 Something Vincent said must've been particularly vile.
 Isaac's expression shifted for just a second.
 They were circling now, both amazingly graceful considering that they were still on the stairs.
 Everyone stepped back a little further.
 I hobbled up a stair or two in an effort to avoid getting in the way.
 I'd heard of tension so thick you could cut it with a knife, but this was the first time I'd ever experienced it.
 It felt like there was electricity surging back and forth between Vincent and Isaac, making my skin feel too small.
 The tension suddenly flickered like a dying light bulb.

How could he use an act of love to manipulate her into staying with him?
 And if she decided to go home anyway, how could he let her go home with the shame he knew she'd feel?
 He couldn't do it.
 No matter how much he loved her, no matter how much he wanted to make love to her and keep her with him, he couldn't do that to her.
 By the time Marie had washed her face and redone her make-up and brushed her hair, the hiccups were gone.
 Good.
 She could go kiss Rick.
 She smiled to herself, thinking about how sweet he was to her.
 Already she was feeling better about ending her betrothal to Davis.
 She wanted a man who would spend time with her and hold her and make her feel safe and cherished.

He must have been more familiar with the powers of the various creatures.
 Doi‚Äôvan had walked past many of the figures until he stood at one toward the back.
 The shape was a powerfully built dragon with wings partially spread as if getting ready to fly.
 But unlike a real dragon this one had three heads at the end of long serpentine necks; one was that of a wolf, one was of an eagle and one was of a lion.
 ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù he asked Doi‚Äôvan.
 ‚ÄúA Bunei.
 They are powerful fighters, but also lead packs of daemons in combat and have powerful magical abilities.
 Most of these others are powerful and dangerous, but a Bunei is more than a simple fighter of the Infernals.
 I am actually surprised to see they‚Äôre with the other beasts.

I winced again.
 It was going to take a lot of work to get people to use my full name.
 "Adriana, but I don't need any help."
 Albert smiled.
 "I know your card wasn't on the red side, but Mrs. Campbell asked me to stop by and go over a couple of steps you left out on your homework assignment from today.
 Since I just finished with Rachel and was over here already, I thought I'd show you the steps you're missing."
 I nodded my assent as I mentally filed away both his name and the girl's.
 Surprisingly enough, Albert was a good teacher, pointing out the steps I'd been skipping over, and even explaining why they were important.
 It was rare enough to find a school teacher who could really teach math these days, finding a student who could teach was nearly a miracle.
 Rachel packed up her things while I was being instructed in the finer points of inequalities.

I told him I thought this was a Scientology-based program, to which he replied that, while this was a common misconception, they did not favor or push any religion.
 A shame, he stated, as this keeps some people away from a very good rehabilitation center where everyone is allowed to practice whatever religion they wish.
 My wife and I had attended Alanon meetings back home and we found them very religious in structure so we expected some Scientology leanings out here in the desert, but found no evidence of any.
 Our son proudly toured us around the grounds and introduced us to everyone we passed.
 He was so enthusiastic and so different.
 Although he was excited to see us, he was calm and collected.
 He was respectful to all and excited to show off his family, he seemed to know everyone.
 We met many of the people who we spoke with on the phone and got to put their faces with their names.

A comprehensive approach to a permanent solution must include social, economic, education and cultural elements.
 The principle illustrated here is that long-standing military conflicts can be resolved by political initiative and obstinate political conflicts can be resolved by economic strategies rooted in the principles of equity and ethics.
 The opening up of economic relations between the USA and China by President Nixon has made war between the two countries almost unthinkable.
 There are no serious conflicts in the world today that cannot be resolved through consultation, consensus and ‚Äòwin-win‚Äô formulas.
 Full Employment
 The fading spectre of nuclear annihilation gave way in the 1990s to the rising spectre of chronic unemployment.
 The end of the Cold War brought with it some wrenching transitions, among them the break-up of the USSR and Comecom, the reunification of Germany, the downsizing of defence manufacturers in America as the result of reduced orders for war materiel, the collapse of Japanese financial markets and onset of a decade-long recession, and displacement of millions of migrant Asian workers following the invasion of Kuwait and the first war in Iraq.
 These events violently disrupted expansion of the world economy and creation of employment opportunities for an expanding labour force in both industrialized and developing countries.
 Near panic levels of concern rippled across the world during this period about rising levels of joblessness, prompting one doomsday author to prophesize the ‚Äòend of work‚Äô.
 The situation became particularly acute in developing countries, because of their predominately young populations and high population growth rates.

Expanding programmes for management training, small business education and counselling, marketing assistance and financial management can bring down the failure rate dramatically.
 3.Voluntary part-timism: Increasing the flexibility of working hours will serve the interests of both businesses and workers.
 Encouraging voluntary part-timism by removing the artificial barriers to job sharing created by employment laws, social security tax laws, administrative procedures and trade unions would raise the morale and productivity of those who prefer to work less, while creating openings for many who are now without jobs.
 In the Netherlands, voluntary part-timism has been identified as the biggest single potential for creating new jobs, capable of reducing the country's unemployment by up to 50 per cent.
 Proportionately reducing working hours and salaries can spread the existing work more evenly over more people.
 Evidence suggests that reduced working time can raise productivity significantly.
 Extending vacation time and medical leave in the United States nearer to levels which the Europeans enjoy would create many more job openings.
 Work or job sharing is not an ultimate answer in itself, but it can have a beneficial short-term impact, allowing time for longer-term measures to take effect.
 As a minimum, governments should remove the artificial barriers to job-sharing created by employment laws, administrative procedures and trade unions.
 Social security tax systems should also be modified to remove the in-built bias that increases the taxes of those who hold multiple, part-time jobs, rather than one full-time job.

The men had patches of hair curled on their chests and forearms and some even grew it around their chins like goats.
 Their clothes were tattered and ill-fitting rags.
 They moved about the camp slowly.
 Clearly they had no magic, and they definitely were the owners of the crude tools we had found.
 They spoke to each other often, their voices like the protest of an old hound.
 I watched until nightfall, when they settled into tents and lean-tos.
 They seemed to assign a watchman, wielding only a torch lit from the central fire.
 I slipped down from the tree and returned to the castle.
 I am dying to see what I can find of them in the books of Father‚Äôs study.
 Laughter broke my concentration.

These subsidies cost Western consumers another $135 billion annually in terms of higher food costs.
 Agricultural protectionism in the North not only places powerful constraints on exports from developing countries, but also directly interfere with the livelihood of one-third of the entire human race living in developing countries.
 The elimination of the system of quotas and subsidies to Western farmers can dramatically reduce the budget deficits of industrial nations and bring down food prices, while stimulating large-scale expansion of agriculture, industrialization and job growth in developing countries.
 Existing trade barriers by the industrial nations to textile exports cost developing countries an estimated $50 billion annually.
 The complete elimination of these barriers could result in a doubling of textile exports by developing countries.
 This labour-intensive industry can be another engine for job creation in developing countries and rising demand for technology and capital goods from the industrial nations.
 The progressive reduction, leading to the eventual elimination, of barriers to trade in agricultural products and textiles is an important step that can substantially improve the employment opportunities of people in developing countries.
 5.Improve access to markets: The most important structural change in the world economy over the past 35 years has been the five-fold increase in the world share of manu factured exports gained by the developing countries as a group, up from 4 per cent to 19 per cent, compared with a current market share of about 13 per cent each of the United States and for Japan.
 Although 54 per cent of these manufactures come from five top exporting countries, a large number of countries export more than $1 billion in this category annually.
 This has opened the door for self-reliant growth in many developing countries.

It took me several seconds to realize it was the truth.
 I didn't have a ride home until Britney finished up her regular studying stint.
 "For Britney?
 Do you want us to give you a ride home?"
 A slight movement, barely seen out of the corner of my eye, gave meaning to the last part of the sentence.
 A familiar-looking guy was standing a few feet from Rachel.
 I couldn't place him.
 I slowly shook my head, trying to jar something loose enough to figure out who he was.
 "Please, Adriana.
 It really isn't any trouble.

He hated having to go to work this morning.
 What if, now that he was trying so hard not to think about anything in 1927, his mind wandered to it?
 He knew he wouldn't be able to bear it if he went home and found that she had disappeared.
 After nearly four hours of trying to concentrate on his work, he gave up and told his secretary that he wasn't feeling well and was going home.
 On his way there, a shop window caught his eye, and he slammed on his brakes, causing the driver behind him to lean on his horn.
 He circled around and dashed into the store.
 Marie had just sat down in front of the TV with a dish of ice cream when she heard the garage door open.
 How odd--why would Rick come home in the middle of the day?
 Remembering how he'd seemed to feel ill yesterday, she set her ice cream down and ran to meet him.
 Rick was just getting out of his car.

 She used the mirror to wipe the tears and kohl smudges from her face.
 Glancing at him, she said, "I don't know your name."
 "Rick.

 "This must be strange for you as well."
 "You can't imagine."
 "I think I can."
 She raised the visor.
 "Can we go to the library now?"

And the Cliffs of Insanity, well, no.
 Jim - What happens to be wrong with the Cliffs of Insanity?
 Art ‚Äì Nothing, they‚Äôre just not really all that deadly.
 I mean what a misnomer, they‚Äôre only five feet high at their tallest, and for the most part they only stand two or three feet in height.
 And then they don‚Äôt exactly qualify as cliffs with their gentle incline and all.
 I wonder what idiot was allowed to name them cliffs in the first place, Don Quixote?

While it was way too small to fit him it would fit Imeralda just fine.
 But to give this woman he barely knew such fine armor and weapons was not something to do casually.
 It made a lot of sense sitting there on the foothills of the Arida Mountains, worrying about Gobelyn and Dire Cat attacks, but they were a great gift; no one had ever given him such a gift.
 ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she asked me ‚ÄúYou are looking at me like I asked you for your first born child,‚Äù she stated in a surprised voice.
 ‚ÄúLast night you two tried to kill me, I thought I was being very generous to share my hideout and give each of you a sword.
 Frankly I am worried that you will both give it back to me when I am sleeping tonight.‚Äù Imeralda looked surprisingly guilty, Doi‚Äôvan looked... well Rodregas could not guess what the expression on his blunt rough face meant.
 ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù said Imeralda once again shaking her long hair behind her, ‚ÄúI feel terrible about that.
 I told Audrian that I was not sure you were really Ravenhurr and that the spell did not go as planned.
 By the Infernals, if the spell had gone as planned I would have burned in creation fire and my magic would be inside of your body right now.‚Äù She caught him with those large amazingly green eyes and said, ‚ÄúI had a theory on what happened, but was not sure how to explain it so Audrian would understand.
 He was adamant, and I couldn‚Äôt argue with his logic, as he had said to you last night, you must be either Gerald or Ravenhurr.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut you aren‚Äôt,‚Äù she continued, ‚ÄúAnd well, you actually seem pretty nice, and you can handle yourself in a fight.

Jasmin was waiting for me, and if she didn't exactly look overwhelmed with joy, she at least wasn't scowling.
 We were just outside Mrs. Campbell's class when a muted hiss from Jasmin alerted me to impending danger.
 I didn't realize what was happening until I felt the rising tingle of energy wash over me.
 It was both warmer and weaker than normal, and for the first time I realized that Jasmin's power was different than what I'd felt from Alec.
 It arced back and forth between us with a fury that jolted me all the way down to the soles of my feet as Vincent and Cassie came into sight.
 The answering surges of power from the two rival shape shifters made my hair stand on end as Jasmin shoved me into the classroom, moving with only slightly more than human speed.
 I probably should have cleared out of the way, but despite there being nothing I could do to help Jasmin if it came to an open fight, I wasn't going to abandon her.
 As Vincent and Cassie got closer, something about them seemed off.
 It is amazing how the mind focuses in on minutia when things get really scary, but I couldn't think of anything else until I realized it was their eyes.
 Cassie's had gone a pale, unearthly green, while Vincent's had deepened into a near black.

Could he kill?
 Could he murder?
 She had to know.
 It took a simple invisibility spell to approach their rundown home unnoticed, her feet moving silently because of her natural elven grace.
 It was midday and the sun was high in the sky.
 Most of the murders occurred once darkness fell, and always when the child wandered into the forest to play.
 Lately no murders had been found, and Aurelia couldn‚Äôt decide if she should be worried or hopeful that they had stopped at the same time she had begun training with Harruq.
 Aurelia peered through a gap in the boards.
 She and Harruq had finished their sparring an hour before, and she expected him to be resting.
 She was right.

It felt illicit.
 Twice I imagined a set of dark eyes on me, a pricking sensation running over my spine.
 I was going to have to pull myself together.
 I was being ridiculous.
 At this rate, I‚Äôd be fawning and flipping my hair like Evelyn by sundown.
 When I finally walked into the library, I remembered why I didn‚Äôt go there to study lineages.
 There must have been a thousand volumes and tenfold more scrolls in the main level alone.
 And I had no magic to lead me in the right direction.
 I went to the section which would most likely house the desired information, and then closed my eyes and concentrated.
 Maybe it wouldn‚Äôt work, but I could try.

Whoever was on the other side of the flimsy metal door I was hiding behind didn't just believe she would kill the other girl, she knew it, like someone who'd killed before.
 As scared as I was, I should have been a gibbering wreck, but strangely enough part of my mind was coldly rational.
 If I walked out right now I might be okay.
 If however they did kill the brunette, they'd come after me too.
 It was possible, it turned out, to be rational but still completely paralyzed by indecision.
 The girl was sobbing now, and my heart felt like it was about to tear itself into pieces.
 The creak of the bathroom door opening should have been a relief.
 I was expecting the tension to evaporate once there were more witnesses.
 I couldn't have been more wrong.
 The air had felt heavy before, now it felt alive, like ground zero of a lightning strike a split second before the soil was blackened by three hundred thousand volts.

The Immortalist Sorcerer in the form of a tall athletic human female with spectacular long red hair and blue eyes gave Van‚Äôdret a silent glare before responding.
 ‚ÄúLast night at the arena party you agreed to ask Van‚Äôdret where Oreintvenir is,‚Äù She replied in a clear clipped voice.
 ‚ÄúActually,‚Äù Van‚Äôdret responded, ‚ÄúI think I said that my visit to his solar would be a perfect opportunity to ask him if he knew the location of our missing Grand Master.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo why did you not take advantage of the opportunity?
 If anyone knows where Oreintvenir is; it is Taiga‚Äù ‚ÄúMy lovely Gracella, you are an Immortalist of impressive power and intellect.
 But we are Immortalist, time is on our side and Grand Master Oreintvenir has been gone for less than a year.
 It is not unusual for one of his power to be gone for such a length of time.
 He could be anywhere on this world or beyond it.
 There is no need to be in such a... rush to ask questions.‚Äù ‚ÄúVan‚Äôdret doesn‚Äôt play your word games with me, you know, and I know that this is not a normal disappearance.
 Not with one of the great cosmic alignments coming in such a short time.
 Neither of us would be surprised if Taiga had killed him and taken his place.

Isaac recovered with admirable speed, smiling as he gestured us forward.
 "Well, then, after you."
 It wasn't until Rachel and Isaac were driving away that I realized she'd completely pulled me out of my funk.
 I still didn't know that I could really depend on her, but at least I knew she'd try her hardest.
 Chapter 17 I reached out groggily to turn off my alarm, and then wished it was still the weekend so I wouldn't have to get up and go to school.
 I finished off my normal morning routine with a pair of aspirin from the bathroom cupboard.
 I didn't usually like taking drugs of any kind, but I had a sharp headache building already.
 I shuffled downstairs, waved a speechless hello to Mom, grabbed my lunch, bag, and books as I absently wondered why there was a cupcake on the counter with a lit candle.
 Mom has always been paranoid about open flames.
 She'd nearly burned down the house as a kid.

His expression took on an alien cast, as he shrugged.
 "Actually I've spent so much of my life trying to hide the unusual aspects of my nature, it's usually effortless.
 For some reason, I forget myself around you."
 There was something to his voice, but even after he'd hinted at having strong feelings for me, it was hard to really believe it all.
 At least not without an outright admission on his part.
 Seeking to distract myself from a thoroughly useless train of thought, I looked around, trying vainly to pierce the curtain of black hanging around the feeble circle of light.
 "Are they out there waiting now?"
 Alec shook his head.
 "No, I'd already have come and carried you away if any of Brandon's people were around.
 Barring that, you'd hear us fighting.

 Blood ran down his arms and sides from several minor cuts.
 The pain was good.
 It helped focus his mind.
 It also fed his rage.

Wolves.
 There weren't supposed to be any wolves in the area, but there wasn't any ignoring my ears.
 I numbly pulled myself back up, and began stumbling back towards the party, only to stop as another howl echoed down through the canyon.
 It was between me and everyone else.
 I turned and started into a shuffling run.
 Maybe the wolf would be attracted to the noise and light.
 Maybe I'd be able to get far enough away it wouldn't smell me.
 I'd only been moving for about a minute before another howl sent chills running down my spine.
 It sounded like a different wolf, and it was closer than the first one.
 I tried to run faster, but all that time studiously avoiding exercise was working against me.

I knew I was larger than her so I gritted my teeth and lunged, grabbing her as I tried to figure my next move.
 She raised her face and, when her eyes met mine, they narrowed.
 Part of me was aware I should have been scared, but I was enjoying myself.
 Whatever pain I might receive didn‚Äôt factor; I had wanted to hurt this wicked little redhead since the first time I‚Äôd seen her, since her hand reached out seductively toward Chevelle and collected my ruby.
 My palms lit where they wrapped around her arms.
 I would finally burn her.
 She cocked one eyebrow at me.
 ‚ÄúHalf fire fairy, silly.‚Äù And I flew through the air to land with a heavy thump a few yards away.
 ‚ÄúWell, it was a little unconventional, but at least you‚Äôre thinking on your feet,‚Äù she mused, straightening the material of her skirt.
 And then she giggled as she realized I was, in fact, not on my feet.

The skewed division of powers allotted under the UN Charter contained the seeds for the bipolar, intensely adversarial relationship between the two military blocs that resulted in the Cold War and the arms race between the superpowers.
 All these arrangements have been based on the concept of competitive security.
 The competitive security paradigm is a state-centred, egocentric approach in which the security of each nation is perceived in terms of its military superiority over potential adversaries.
 The push of each nation for unlimited security through military power is inherently destabilizing, since it inevitably increases the level of insecurity of other sovereign states.
 In practice, the effort of nations to arm themselves against perceived external threats generates a sense of insecurity among other nations and compels them in turn to increase military preparedness, thus initiating a vicious spiral, as it did during the Cold War.
 When NATO and the Warsaw Pact had armed themselves to the point where direct confrontation became too risky, mutual suspicion and insecurity led them to fight each other through proxy wars in the developing world.
 Every move by either side was perceived as a potential security threat, prompting a counter by the other.
 Compounded by the inherent instability of nuclear weapons, this doctrine led to the anomaly of increasing military power and steadily decreasing national and international security.
 This highly militarized approach contains an in-built mechanism for escalation that was responsible for the growth of global military expenditure to an all-time peak of $1.2 trillion in 1988.
 Even when effective in controlling direct aggression between major powers, it encouraged proxy wars and it completely ignored the security needs of countries not aligned with one bloc or another.

Rick had planned to go to the office for a while the next morning, but his friend Dirk called to challenge him to a couple of games of racquetball.
 "Didn't wake you up, did I?"
 Dirk asked as they warmed up.
 "No--I was in bed reading the paper."
 "I was in bed too--and desperately needed to get out.
 Thanks for the rescue."
 Rick shook his head.
 Dirk, at 28 three years younger than Rick, was as leery of marriage as Rick, but for different reasons.
 He liked having a variety of women to choose from, frequently juggled more than one relationship--if you could call them that--at once, and sometimes seemed to enjoy getting caught at it so that he could put his charm to a real test.

Before the attacker could deliver another blow he was inside his opponents swing.
 Getting close is not always the best strategy on a powerful larger opponent.
 His attacker‚Äôs large hand reached for his face.
 Rodregas turned into his weight and tried to use his momentum to drive the large body off balance.
 But the attacker was built like a bull: broad and full of muscle.
 Rodregas‚Äô push against him had little effect.
 Something felt odd about this last attacker; his body felt wrong, not human.
 Rodregas thought, ‚Äúmaybe an Orqui?‚Äù That would explain the muscular build, but that did not seem totally right either.
 The fighters separated.
 Sometimes there is a mutual agreement during a fight, especially when both are not sure who has the advantage.

Each of these strategies has proved effective in stimulating employment, though none by itself may be sufficient to solve the problem.
 A comprehensive, total approach, rather than partial and half-way measures, is needed.
 No industrial country can claim that it systematically exploits all the potential benefits of the strategies in this list.
 This should be the highest priority of every Western government today.
 1.Promote small businesses: All the publicity given to the impact of down-sizing by major corporations has obscured the fact that the top 500 US firms employ less than five per cent of the US workforce.
 It is also the smaller firms that are responsible for job growth.
 Businesses employing fewer than 20 workers presently account for 57 per cent of new job creation in Europe.
 Based upon the successful examples of many developing countries that have stimulated growth in this sector, there is vast scope for expanding services to support new enterprises through better access to management and employee training courses, credit and R & D facilities; by testing and certification for those who want to start businesses; and by estab lishing business incubators to provide work space and shared services as well as technical, financial and marketing expertise to start-up companies.
 2.Reduce business failures: New businesses create most of the jobs, but they destroy most of them too, by going out of business.
 The failure rate of new businesses is extremely high in most industrial nations.

Strategies for Developing Countries
 For the developing countries as a whole, the most critical question is how to create quickly hundreds of millions of jobs for the poor with limited purchasing power and limited capital for investment.
 The idea that most of these jobs could be created in the corporate sector or by government-sponsored activities has been put to rest.
 Currently, there are nearly one billion self-employed and unpaid family workers in the world, most of them self-employed farmers in developing countries.
 The self-employed represent 48 per cent of the workforce in low-income economies (less than $500 per capita GDP).
 For any strategy to be successful, it must give central importance to self-employment and entrepreneurship, with emphasis on agriculture, agro-industry and small firms in the informal sector.
 While a single approach will not be applicable to countries and regions of the world in different stages of development, a number of common principles and strategies are widely applicable.
 Agriculture as an engine
 Slightly more than half the world‚Äôs workforce, of whom 30 per cent are women, are still engaged in agriculture.
 Agriculture will remain the largest single occupation for the foreseeable future.

 "Anyway, today alone has been a perfect date."
 "What do you mean?"
 "Breakfast in bed, washing my car, now watching TV."
 "You call that a date?"
 "Yeah.
 What do you call a date?"

‚ÄúNo buts.
 He was a perfect gentleman.‚Äù
 The half-orc threw his arms up in surrender.
 He sat down beside her and did his best to focus on the letters.
 Aurelia seemed impressed enough with his progress, and they soon began working on simple words further into the book.
 ‚ÄúWhy does your brother speak so strangely,‚Äù she asked once they were done, trying to broach the subject casually.
 She sat stretched out on the grass, her legs crossed and her weight leaning back on her arms.
 The whole time they had taught she had found her mind wandering to the sick, spidery voice Qurrah spoke in, a voice that had nearly spoiled his otherwise surprising charm.
 ‚ÄúQurrah was sold to a necromancer.
 I told you that, right?‚Äù

With regret he put his own wishes aside.
 "Is that the bigger pair?
 If not, let's get some bigger ones."
 "No--these are the small ones.
 I'll go try the others."
 They bought the bigger pair and two shirts, and Marie wore the jeans and the red and navy shirt from the store.
 "Thank you for the clothes, Rick," she said, smiling up at him.
 "You're welcome.
 Do you like them?"
 "Very much."

Antonil stared at the small town, seeing very little motion within.
 No people wandered the streets.
 No traveling merchants hawked their wares.
 He sighed and turned to Sergan, his trusted advisor in war.
 The man was old, scarred, and had dirty hair falling down to his shoulders.
 He had seen many wars, and the axe against his shoulder had claimed more than a few lives.
 ‚ÄúYes, let us end this, one way or the other,‚Äù Antonil said.
 ‚ÄúOrder them to march.

 What point is sharpening your sword if you never wield it?‚Äù
 Harruq had no reply.
 Eyes low, he stepped out into the night, Aurelia trailing not far behind.
 They travelled deeper into the town.
 A knot grew in her stomach as she noticed he had both his swords, and as they approached the poorer parts of the town, the knot only tightened.
 She watched the half-orc glance in through the windows of the buildings he passed.
 She found herself praying he only meant to steal possessions‚Ä¶‚Äåjust possessions, nothing more.
 _Keep the swords sheathed,_ she prayed.

I normally would've been mad, or possibly embarrassed, but it was like my feelings were wrapped in layers of cotton candy.
 If I really pushed, I could faintly feel the hard edges, but there were so many layers shrouding them.
 I just couldn't seem to muster up enough concentration to care.
 I was on autopilot now.
 I answered Britney's whispered questions without ever registering them and never once worried about whether or not I'd made sense.
 I parried Mrs. Campbell's concerned inquiries in much the same manner, probably not convincing her that I was okay, but at least persuading her to leave me alone, and then sleep-walked into the cafeteria.
 I hated the fact that I wanted Brandon to come sit down with me.
 If he did a convincing enough job pretending to like me and I tried really hard, maybe I'd believe it'd all just been my imagination.
 It'd be one less piece of my world crumbling out from under me.
 Britney slammed her tray down, but my listless gaze didn't move from the vacant corner where Brandon usually sat.

Doi‚Äôvan was out messing with the well, Imeralda was reading one of the magic Grimoires by the fireplace.
 Rodregas was supposed to be reading as well, but had lost his focus on the complex diagram and was just looking at Imeralda.
 She was so beautiful, slim yet curvy.
 Some of those curves were smooth muscle and some were pure female.
 She seemed to have brought together two of the most attractive parts of the AElves and the Nymphs: the slim athletic body of the AElf with the full curves of a Nymph.
 Her skin had a smooth, light golden brown color that often shined with sweat during their practices and looked so soft that it was hard not to reach out and touch it.
 ‚ÄúDid you need something?‚Äù asked Imeralda.
 Rodregas had not realized that she had noticed him watching her.
 There was a tease to her voice and expression that said she knew what he was thinking and that she did not mind.
 Rodregas was an experienced man but he was not sure if he had ever seen a woman as beautiful as her, much less thought that he ever had a chance with such a woman.

 Johnny ‚Äì He did, but Gene‚Äôs dad wouldn‚Äôt sign any papers.
 Jim ‚Äì Isn‚Äôt Gene old enough to get around that?

‚ÄúWhere did we finish?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúActually we did pretty good.
 There were more than a few that cannot go on, even if you had won.
 You finished eighth overall in the tournament, with a second place white ribbon for the joust.
 Several of those who would now be higher are too injured to continue.
 So you are now in fourth place overall.
 Geriodon and Nordien were the top two finishers,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan.
 Rodregas nodded.
 The pain was easier to manage knowing that at least he was still in the running for the tournament championship.
 Imeralda stepped into his sight shaking her head, ‚ÄúYou men are crazy sometimes; you actually look pleased!

Maybe he even thought it was endearing.
 Failing that, I at least hoped he wasn't chuckling with his friends over the new girl's stupid infatuation.
 He wasn't doing either, in fact, he seemed to be very much involved in a conversation with the stocky boy on his right.
 The rest of the kids at the table were listening just as intensely, all except for the brunette on Brandon's left who was looking in our direction.
 My face pulled back in a smile, I even brought my hand partway up in a wave before I realized I recognized her.
 It was the trendy girl from the office, and she apparently still didn't like me.
 I felt my face get even hotter, only now I was both angry and embarrassed.
 It was a relief to sink down into a chair with my back to Brandon and his friends.
 Strangely enough, Britney also being so obviously uncomfortable helped calm me down.
 "Okay, out with it, why is this such a big deal?"

When we rely on the inner resources, we achieve the maximum because we are constantly led to discover more of our own unlimited capacities.
 Why should we wait before acting until we are compelled by the irresistible force of the rising expectations of the world‚Äôs masses, by the explosion of violence in our cities, or by the complete breakdown of our economic systems because of spiralling unemployment?
 Why should we not act now to prevent these outcomes and reverse the trends that threaten to make them a reality?
 All the resources necessary are within our reach, within ourselves.
 We need the courage to think and say that it is time to abolish weapons of mass destruction and call a halt to the use of war for settlement of disputes, that it is time to insist that all people enjoy the most basic democratic freedoms, that there can and must be enough food produced to feed everyone, and that every person must be guaranteed the right to gainful employment.
 The barriers to these achievements are not material or technological.
 It takes money, materials and technology to make war, not to stop it.
 That requires a determination and insistence, an intolerance of violence, which must start with a commitment of the world‚Äôs leaders and the total empowerment of the UN to enforce peace.
 It takes material resources and technology to suppress people, not to make them free.
 That requires an acceptance of basic human rights as a non-negotiable minimum requirement for each nation to participate in the international community, which must start with a voluntary abdication by the great powers of the principle of rule by might that governs the present structure of the UN.

She shifted uncomfortably from one foot to another, eyes glancing to each side of us in an effort to see who might overhear us.
 "We can't talk about it here; you'll have to trust me.
 Wait until lunch."
 I wasn't entirely satisfied, but nodded, and followed her to algebra.
 Mrs. Campbell shot us both a glance that didn't bode well for any attempt to get out of class without a stern reprimand, but allowed us to go to our respective seats without comment.
 I pulled out the two assignments I'd done the night before, and passed them up with everyone else's homework.
 Realizing the lecture wouldn't do me any good, I pulled out my book, and started reading the next section in my self-appointed study regimen.
 Mrs. Campbell either understood what I was trying to accomplish, or was saving up all her venom for after class.
 She didn't call on me even once.
 Britney wasn't so lucky, and I caught a nasty look from her each time I surfaced from my textbook.

"Please don't.
 I didn't mean to make you nervous.
 It's just that you continue to surprise me."
 "It's more than a little creepy how you all can do that.
 Are all shape shifters born with the ability to read people's minds?"
 The smile was back, gentle and teasing.
 "Minds no, scents yes.
 The human body is quite marvelous in how many different systems it recruits to match its mood."
 The way Brandon had always known exactly the right thing to say at any given time suddenly made sense.
 Alec let me process his latest little tidbit of information, and then continued.

While most of us played eight-ball or listened to Sunday‚Äôs dad, Ivan, an engineer, explain how things worked, Eric listened to the Messiah.
 I knew he loved Christmas, which was near.
 Besides, I had given up surprise at anything he might do.
 So I hardly noted the changes in his obsessions and moods, until Christmas day.
 It was the second anniversary of losing my dad.
 After the family party at my Aunt Evangeline‚Äôs place, where my dad had eaten his final meal, I drove to pick up Eric.
 He wanted to go to Sunset Cliffs, near Fort Rosecrans where his dad was buried.
 His dad, Carl Curtis, was an Army Air Force pilot who crashed during a test flight while Eric was still a baby.
 Sylvia blamed her sister Rosarie for the crash.
 Rosarie, she believed, wielded demonic powers.

He couldn‚Äôt even look at us as he drove away to God knows where.
 We were numb.
 Our son was 6‚Äô2‚Äù about 135 pounds and addicted to one of the most powerful drugs on the street: Oxycontin.
 What would happen to him?
 Would he get busted again, overdose or die in a drug deal gone bad?
 We contemplated the worst as we watched what was our son, our first-born, drive off into complete uncertainty.
 We didn‚Äôt know Brandon at all, and we really believed we might never see him again.
 On the day of his birth which seemed like yesterday, I had watched as his little body took its first breath and now I felt like I might be watching him take his last.
 We chose not to tell any of my wife‚Äôs family because we were quite frankly, embarrassed.
 My wife‚Äôs family was similar to the 1950s TV Cleavers, and we didn‚Äôt think they would understand, so for now it remained a family secret.

 ‚ÄúIt is a beautiful blade,‚Äù Harruq said, examining the elven weapon that had belonged to Ahrqur.
 They were killing the final hour before dark.
 Then they would hoist the wrapped body onto Harruq‚Äôs shoulder and sneak out of town.
 Qurrah sat meditating in a corner while Harruq yammered to himself.
 The blade was in one hand, the decorative scabbard in the other.

He closed his hands around it, just like this, and then whispered some words he learned from secretly watching Master.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúMaster?‚Äù Aurelia asked, interrupting him again.
 ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Harruq said, frowning.
 ‚ÄúMy brother didn‚Äôt have too much fun before I found him.
 We were both sold, but I escaped.
 Qurrah, though, he was sold to Master‚Ä¶‚Äåforget it, that‚Äôs for another time.
 All that matters is that he learned those words before he met me.
 He whispered something, opened his hands, and then just like that the mouse got up and started running.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúHe brought it to life?‚Äù she asked.
 ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Äù Again he stopped, obviously uneasy about what he wanted to say.

The slender fighter flipped backward, clutching her sword in both hands.
 She landed softly behind the sorceress.
 ‚ÄúTake him,‚Äù she said.
 A bolt of lightning hit his shield, numbing his arm and knocking him back.
 The shield slumped low, but he charged anyway, fully willing to die fighting.
 ‚ÄúFor Neldar,‚Äù he cried, thrusting at Aurelia‚Äôs chest.
 Felewen was there first.
 All it took was three cuts.
 The first took the man‚Äôs sword from his hand.
 The second took his arm from his body.

All night we sped across the desert.
 My mom and aunt were dressed for breakfast by the time we arrived, to their surprise and dismay.
 They loaned us their room until evening.
 Room service delivered bourbon and ginger ale.
 Around noon, we adjourned to the pool, on the lookout for showgirls.
 At least that was my motive.
 The pool featured a high dive like the one at Carmen Ranch Club where Eric worked part-time as an apprentice lifeguard and trampoline instructor.
 He climbed, sprang, jackknifed and got a few cheers from spectators, including several showgirls.
 Though I had never attempted a high dive before, after some bourbon, the feat looked simple.
 Inches from the end of the board was a depression full of water, on which my foot slipped.

Famine attracts media coverage, political and public attention, but chronic hunger does not.
 With global food surpluses accumulating, an organized effort can ensure food security for people everywhere.
 The challenge of achieving food security for all human beings is complex, for it depends on the interaction between multiple factors ‚Äì technological initiatives to produce sufficient food; economic initiatives to stimulate sufficient employment opportunities and increase purchasing power; political initiatives to maintain a peaceful and stable environment, undisturbed by war or social unrest that can interfere with food distribution; and administrative initiatives to provide for those who are unable to provide for themselves due to poverty or during times of emergency.
 Peace, democracy, employment and food security are mutually interdependent.
 The efforts proposed to promote peace, democracy and employment generation will mitigate the problem of food security to a considerable extent.
 In addition, Chapter Five of the Commission‚Äôs report highlights direct interventions that are needed to address the problem at the level of agricultural productivity, among which the following are particularly relevant in the present context:
 Farm Productivity: The attraction of high technology service industries should not blind us to the fact that a large section of humanity still depends on agriculture as its main source of income and livelihood.
 Farm productivity in these countries is typically less than a fourth or fifth the average attained by other countries.
 Low agricultural productivity results in high cost food, low rural incomes and limited employment opportunities, both on farm and in downstream industries.
 As a revolution in agricultural productivity provided the impetus for rapid industrialization in Britain and later USA in the 19th Century, rapid modernization of agricultural technology, a shift to commercial crops, improved linkages for credit, marketing and processing can act as a catalyst for employment generation and economic growth in many developing countries today.

Metal would interfere with the magic so the guards held simple wooden clubs and wore only linen clothes with no metal fastenings.
 As Rodregas pushed the half AElf into her circle, making sure not to disturb the bluish sand covered in swirls of colorful small crystals, he was surprised at how vulnerable he felt without his armor but readied himself for the task at hand.
 He quickly reached out to the woman and pulled off her gag, as even that would count as a binding and would interfere with the ritual.
 He wanted to whisper to her as he removed it, and give her a hint of the desperate gambit that he was about to try, but he knew that it was not worth the risk of others overhearing.
 Both of their lives depended on her doing what Rodregas had told her.
 If he succeeded, she would know what Rodregas had done; if he failed, well he was familiar enough with that feeling.
 He saw her lips forming something under her breath, probably a spell, but she did not have time to execute a spell of sufficient strength in the time left her.
 Magic took too long to prepare to be useful so quickly.
 Ravenhurr stepped into the last circle; the one made entirely of what appeared to be fresh blood and of symbols made from the careful placement of living organs.
 Rodregas breathed in deeply, trying to settle himself, and almost gagged from the smells: the stench of fresh blood, the scent of fear from the prisoners, the smell of power, and other smells that he could not identify.

He noticed my open mouth, blank expression, and sat again, eyeing me questioningly, all humor gone.
 ‚ÄúYou seem to be really good at magic,‚Äù I offered.
 He chuckled.
 ‚ÄúIs that so?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, well, I‚Ä¶ I need to learn.‚Äù ‚ÄúLearn?‚Äù The humor was gone again.
 ‚ÄúWhat do you mean learn?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never, well, except for fire, and I need someone to teach me‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôre‚Ä¶‚Äù I waved a hand in his direction.
 His brow rose.

 Maybe I was a few nuts short of a bushel.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lost my mentor.
 Can you teach me magic?

A model?
 Eugene - Yes, I did some modeling.
 What‚Äôs so funny about that.
 Art ‚Äì Gene, sometimes you‚Äôre like another son so I hate to say this.
 You‚Äôve not exactly got the good looks necessary to be a successful model in the ordinary sense.
 What were you modeling for?
 Eugene ‚Äì I‚Äôd rather not talk about it.
 Art ‚Äì That‚Äôs not what I think it means, does it?
 There‚Äôs no need to get into that‚Ä¶

But now I have stolen the body of a very promising young man.
 I will die feeling guilty for what I have done, but I plan to take a few of you with me.
 Now, it is my turn for a question,‚Äù he said.
 Rodregas hoped that Imeralda would do whatever she was going to do soon; the conversation was escalating and he did not think they had much time before things got deadly.
 Rodregas asked, ‚ÄúWhy did the Immortalist Taiga capture my friend Doi‚Äôvan and keep him in his Menagerie of Earth, Sky and Fire for two years before selling him to Ravenhurr?
 He is a Hellborn and should have been of no interest to those trying to become Celestial Gods.‚Äù Van‚Äôdret became very still at this question, for a long moment he neither moved nor spoke.
 Rodregas wondered briefly if he even breathed or if the powerful sorcerer had moved beyond such mortal needs.
 Finally Van‚Äôdret said, ‚ÄúI cannot say what was in the minds of others.‚Äù Van‚Äôdret started to raise his hand and Rodregas spoke quickly trying to keep him engaged, ‚ÄúSo, are you saying there are not Immortalists led by Taiga who are breaking ‚ÄòThe One Law‚Äô set by both the Gods in the Celestial Realm and the Daemon Lordsin the Infernal to keep balance?‚Äù Van‚Äôdret went pale at Rodregas words and then he stood up very tall.
 For the first time true anger was in his words, ‚ÄúYou do not know what you are getting in the middle of.
 You are barely more than a squire and yet you would get in a battle of beings so much greater than you?‚Äù The Immortalist went from anger to laughter, but his laughter did not last long.

Unlike you, I can actually think for myself.
 I don't know what kind of sick hold Alec has over you, but until you do something about it, you'll never have any real friends.
 He won't ever let you have one."
 She wiped away a pair of tears before they could escape from the corner of her eyes.
 "You don't know what you're talking about, Adri.
 You really can't trust Brandon.
 He's not safe."
 "Whatever.
 Like your brother is any better."
 I turned and went out through the exterior door.

He had incredibly dark skin and features with a slight Middle Eastern cast.
 When he shifted in his seat, I realized he was built like a football player.
 Not like a lineman, but like a running back, or maybe a quarterback.
 He wasn't as big as Brandon, or even as Alec, but he was obviously well muscled, and he moved with an echo of their grace.
 None of which helped me figure out where I'd seen him before.
 He wasn't a regular at the tutor lab, and didn't have the hectic, desperate look of someone cramming for a test.
 Instead he looked completely at ease sitting in one of the no-man's-land tables with a pair of books open in front of him.
 By the looks of things he wasn't going to need any help.
 Once it was just the four of us, Britney waved me over and held up her homework.

 Aurelia had heard enough.
 She knew their roles, the balance and position of their hearts.
 It was absurd, poor souls without a home, family, or position to be speaking of power and obligation.
 Her hatred of their unknown master grew.
 He was a puppet-master, and her dear friend was one of his puppets.
 If they still doubted, even for a moment, perhaps she could save them.

I haven't gotten on the charter plane yet, there's still time to call this off if you're uneasy about being alone for so long."
 The last place I wanted her right now was home though, so it was easier than normal to lie.
 "Mom, this is the chance of a lifetime.
 Don't worry about me, I'll be fine."
 There was a long pause as her dreams warred with normal maternal instincts.
 I could hear a plane start up in the background by the time she finally responded.
 "Okay, honey.
 If you're sure, then we'll do it, but if anything comes up just call me.
 I'll keep my cell phone with me all the time, and I made them promise to fly me back no questions asked if it became necessary."
 I stifled a laugh at the idea of Mom making a twelve-hour flight back to the US because I stubbed my toe, and instead tried to interject even more sincerity into my voice.

They would find me if they wanted to.
 There was no stopping them.
 I had no magic, no tracking skills, no clue.
 I stopped running.
 My heart pounded, the wind cutting against the damp sweat on my skin.
 I wanted to understand what had just happened, but I couldn‚Äôt process it.
 It was just too painful.
 I was confused, drained to the point of exhaustion.
 I had no way out.
 When they found me, I would have to surrender.

I was frozen in fear, realizing that I hated falling.
 This was worse than my fear of rollercoasters.
 ‚ÄúCalm down,‚Äù Seth said to me.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to fall-‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, Seth?‚Äù I said in a panicked voice.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre freaking falling right now!‚Äù Emily looked at us and she tried to hide the fear in her face.
 ‚ÄúThe dragon is going to pull its wings around us to protect us from falling but it‚Äôs going to make us fall faster.
 Make sure you hold on to something or get in the center.‚Äù Seth pressed himself against me and we leaned closer to the dragon‚Äôs back.
 Jason tucked his arms under him and Emily pressed next to him.
 Then, as if on cue, the dragon tucked its great wings over us, blocking out the sky and we began to really fall.
 I screamed louder and sunk deeper into Seth, trying to forget that we were falling at about 90 miles per hour without a parachute.

I found them the kindest, most generous, least self-concerned group I have ever encountered.
 But they were also the happiest of people, which I couldn‚Äôt make sense of, until one afternoon when a mob of locals came to pick up groceries.
 These folks lived in a shantytown on the bank of an oily swamp I call the Black Lagoon.
 The neighborhood is so poor that when my cousin and I delivered a rusted tool shed to one of the families, they used it as a granny flat.
 I was helping the Brothers pass out vegetables when I got blessed with a feeling so profound, the recollection of it still uplifts me.
 These people I was helping, though not on my own but as a paid reporter, were blessing me.
 Like Curly did at Chapters Books.
 And like Mother Teresa blessed me.
 One Saturday a few years back, my friend Diane called.
 As a lay Missionary of Charity, she knew, and whispered to me, that Mother was around, visiting the MC houses in Tijuana and San Diego, in secret like she did, since she preferred not to get mobbed.

 Seth shouted, ‚ÄúStay together, don‚Äôt get separated!‚Äù A troll charged at me and I jumped to the side.
 I looked up and saw that Emily, Jason, and Seth had been swallowed by the rushing creatures.
 So much for that plan.
 ‚ÄúEmily!‚Äù I yelled but my voice was drowned out.
 I saw a flash of fire off to the side.

The countries and regions which produce these drugs, and through which the trade flows, have been afflicted by endemic violence and social turbulence.
 A similar impact occurs at the point of concentrated consumption, especially in the inner cities of America, where crime and murder rates have soared due to drug-related violence.
 Inevitably, drug trafficking is linked with illicit arms, terrorist groups and the Mafia.
 Criminal elements are increasingly gaining control over the administrative and political structures of drug-producing states, where drug-related corruption permeates the military and government.
 Neither the proliferation of small arms, nor the proliferation of drugs, nor the growth of terrorist and criminal activity can be solved as isolated problems, or by the independent initiatives of individual states.
 No country is exempt from the danger, which will continue to multiply unless checked and eradicated by concerted international action.
 Urgent steps are needed to classify and register small arms production and trade, to monitor and control their manufacture and limit their export.
 Agreements are needed to reduce production and severely restrict sales.
 Strong sanctions must be instituted to discourage states from actively or passively aiding or abetting small arms proliferation.
 The scope of the UN Conventional Arms Register should be expanded to cover small arms, but at the same time its provisions must be greatly strengthened in order to make this an effective mechanism.

Tight monetary policy can generate intense short-term pressure for change in behaviour, but this pressure is applied indiscriminately and often with unexpected and unanticipated results.
 The primary result of premature liberalization of prices was to encourage trade and speculation while discouraging production and investment.
 It distracted attention from fundamental changes in institutions and social attitudes needed for the transition to be successful.
 Macro-level policy measures have to be complemented and supported by parallel micro-level efforts to educate the population about the new economic system, to generate a free flow of information ‚Äì not just freedom, but the actual exchange of information, which is still severely limited in these countries ‚Äì to develop new distribution systems, to impart appropriate business and managerial skills, to provide access to credit, to build up new social institutions and to en courage and promote new enterprises.
 In most cities of the former Soviet Union, for instance, there is not a single whole sale market for food.
 There are no systems for consumer credit, no agencies in charge of promoting small business development.
 In the absence of these and other essential micro-level conditions, even the right macro-level strategy will not evoke the anticipated response.
 6.Government regulation is essential for a free market: A free market does not mean an unregulated one.
 Quite understandably, decades of totalitarian government had generated such powerful resentment against strong government that by way of re action the society sought for solutions which did not require government to take a highly visible, leading role.
 The reform programme was based on the implicit assumption that the market is a self-regulating mechanism which can substitute for regulation by government.

"There's only one way you're going to touch her, James.
 Are you really ready to take that step?"
 I felt shivers run down me as I realized just how easily everything could boil over into deadly violence.
 The tension in the room pulsed out in waves, skittering many-legged across my skin like something that belonged under a rock somewhere.
 The feeling intensified even more as first Jessica and then Jasmin picked up the same strange, near epileptic quiver.
 James let out a low, grating growl, and my stomach dropped as he looked up with eyes that weren't the unremarkable brown they'd been just a second before.
 The hot yellow eyes of a predator were looking out of James' familiar face, changing it into something threatening and inhuman.
 Answering growls from Jasmin and Jessica seemed to snap something inside of Alec.
 His tremble became more pronounced.
 There was a ripping sound, and when I looked down at his hands, they'd been replaced by the same wickedly-sharp claws I remembered from the night before.

One reason I would rather seek the beautiful than the good is because I can know with more confidence when I have encountered it.
 When I first read the John Keats poem, ‚ÄúOde on a Grecian Urn‚Äù I got both enthralled and challenged by the lines ‚ÄúBeauty is truth, truth beauty.
 That is all we know on earth and all we need to know.‚Äù I believe those words are inspired, expressing deep though mysterious wisdom.
 Bible translators may avoid the word "beauty" because too many readers might interpret in ways akin to the ‚Äô60s motto, ‚ÄúIf it feels good, do it.‚Äù In my vocabulary, "beautiful" describes a harmony that suggests the eternal.
 Such beauty may harbor sadness, or even a terrifying dread.
 It speaks to us of what Robert Pirsig, in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance terms Quality, and which he proposes as the principle in charge of the cosmos.
 I read somewhere that Dostoyevski once asserted: even if he knew for a fact God didn‚Äôt exist, he would continue to believe.
 If he did make that apparently loco remark, I would bet he was trying to express the beauty to which communion with God can lead us.
 Like today, when I find myself delivered far beyond the ordinary, into a realm where the glory of simple hills and pastures, of cows and bluebirds, is such that I know why the prophets described heaven as jeweled and paved in gold.
 Father Zossima in The Brothers Karamazov relates this kind of beauty.

Harruq held in a chuckle.
 It was obvious the guard had little love for the disgusting noble.
 ‚ÄúNothing?
 By Ashhur, it is the smelliest, dirtiest nothing I have ever seen.
 Shoo you foul beast, we have no need of your stench.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYou have little need of what we bring,‚Äù Qurrah said, the whip uncurling from his arm and falling to the dirt.
 A single thought made the black leather burst into flames.
 ‚ÄúAssassins!‚Äù a guard shouted, drawing his blade.
 The other guards, six in total, did the same.
 The perfumed man in the center shook as he realized combat was about to erupt.

My friend Diane Otocar, a lay sister with Mother Teresa‚Äôs Missionaries of Charity, told me about a fellow who asked Mother what he should do for her and her ministry.
 ‚ÄúDo you have a family?‚Äù she asked.
 ‚ÄúI do,‚Äù he admitted.
 She said, ‚ÄúFirst, take care of your family.‚Äù "So there," I mumble.
 Out of all the people since Jesus, I can‚Äôt think of any whose advice I should trust more than Mother Teresa‚Äôs.
 But I know we humans can talk ourselves into or out of most anything.
 Books
 One reason I decided to arrange a book signing in Seattle was so I could visit Jaime and Mark Baird and meet their one-year-old Gavin.
 Not long ago, Mark did a tour as an Army psychologist in Iraq.
 Jaime recently earned a Master of Arts degree from Perelandra College, which Pam and I founded about eight years ago, and which I essentially run.

And because he always put what was best for me before what he wanted.
 We would kiss and kiss and kiss, and then he'd stop and tell me we had to stop, or we'd end up making love.
 And I was never the one to stop, Mother.
 The more passionate the kisses became, the more I wanted.
 I-I really didn't understand until my last evening with him that we couldn't just kiss forever, that eventually kisses wouldn't be enough.
 If he hadn't stopped, we would have gone on and on and on until--"  She caught her breath, biting her lip and fixing her eyes on the handkerchief she was clenching.
 Mrs. Tranton leaned forward, putting a hand on her daughter's knee.
 "I understand."
 Marie glanced up.
 "I love him, Mother."

 Her smile faded.
 "You should have.

 Briefly he considered trying again to kiss her but instead took a lock of her hair to play with.
 "You haven't disrupted it.
 You've made it better."
 He put his arm around her, squeezing her shoulders.
 "Anyway, today alone has been a perfect date."
 "What do you mean?"

Ruby had been right to drug me; I didn‚Äôt think I could have handled it otherwise.
 They were watching me, unsure what I was doing as I sat helpless and swearing.
 ‚ÄúI need something to draw with.‚Äù Ruby pulled a piece of charcoal and scrap of paper from her bags.
 I rushed to sketch the path I remembered from my dream, focusing on the ring of trees with the most detail.
 ‚ÄúThey are there.‚Äù The men stood, motionless and staring until Anvil crossed the room to retrieve the map.
 He bowed a little as he took the paper from my hands and then hurried out, Grey following.
 Chevelle stayed.
 Ruby turned to him and breathed a deep sigh but he didn‚Äôt respond.
 My head throbbed and I groaned as I pressed the bridge of my nose.
 He was beside me in a flash, unspeaking.

He played for the rush, for the approach to the godhead.
 It was religion to Buddy.
 He sought the perfect note, the one that would bring about rapture.
 One night, after a triple billing at the Shell (Black Lung was the middle act that night, sandwiched between the lesser talents of Rubdown and Barry and the White Panthers), Buddy wandered backstage after his set, still in that trance he seemed to enter when he played, and was greeted by a statuesque blond with eyes the color of the Wolf River at Sunset.
 She stepped into his path like a gunfighter.
 Buddy looked deeply into her.
 She was an equation he could not quite decipher.
 Her eyes stayed on his.
 She was bewitching him and even Buddy, already high from making music, was not immune.
 Today people still talk about Lorelei Enos with a wary reticence.

The corporations could also acquire the rights to important technologies with large-scale applications and then market them widely.
 Velocity of social forces
 Speed is a powerful engine for development and an important index of organizational efficiency and effectiveness.
 The higher the level of organization and development, the faster everything moves.
 The more developed the society, the faster it communicates new ideas and new information, develops new technologies and products, establishes new systems and institutions, adopts new policies and laws, transports goods, delivers services and carries out activities.
 Money, information, education, technology, public opinion, training, administrative decisions, transport, and communication are powerful social forces and resources.
 Their productivity can be increased by increasing the speed with which they are employed, in the same way that land productivity can be raised by increasing cultivation from one to two cropping seasons per year.
 In the most industrially advanced nations, the velocity of money is roughly 2.5 to 3 times higher than in the average developing country.
 Removing administrative red tape and inefficiencies in the banking system can multiply the use value and productivity of real money, because the same money can be utilized for more transactions.
 The same is true for information, technology, training, transport and other factors.

It's a heck of a thing to not want to be healthy, but I'd gone to bed most every night hoping I'd get to experience another one.
 It was depressing to think that I probably had one less thing to look forward to.
 Looking at the clock, I saw that I was a bit behind schedule.
 The bus would be here in about ten minutes, and Britney was supposed to arrive just a tad before that.
 It was sad, but I didn't trust her anymore, so I'd probably take the bus if she didn't show up before it did.
 I just couldn't risk her leaving me here without a ride.
 She'd been way weirded out after my collapse.
 I wasn't sure even the promise of Brandon's continued presence would be enough to convince her to come through on her word.
 I hurried downstairs and grabbed my liquid lunch replacement out of the fridge.
 I was in such a hurry I almost didn't see the new note on the white board.

Steve and Ashley: I would later find out that Steve posted bail and was busted shortly thereafter for robbery and assault as he pistol-whipped and beat his next victim.
 By the time he went to trial for this bust, he had also been busted again for another drug deal.
 Steve is now serving five years in prison.
 The last I heard about Ashley is that she is prostituting herself to support her drug habit.
 NARCONON: Information about Narconon is readily available on the Internet; the official site explains the theories of detoxification, based on the work of L. Ron Hubbard.
 Brandon: Sadly, as he neared the 2-year sobriety mark, Brandon relapsed.
 I immediately knew just by talking to him over the phone.
 I wouldn‚Äôt have noticed the changes in his behavior had I not come to know the new sober Brandon after his treatment at Narconon and his subsequent employment at the facility.
 Brandon reluctantly agreed to return to Narconon to try to discover ‚Äúwhat he had missed‚Äù but he didn‚Äôt go easily.
 Drug addicts are convinced that they can handle the issue themselves and believing that lie could prove deadly for them.

But that pleasure had frightened her, because it was wrong.
 She was betrothed to Davis.
 When she was dressed, she put her betrothal ring back on.
 She shouldn't have left it off last night.
 And she should have asked Rick to set an alarm for her so that she could have walked in the garden this morning.
 She shouldn't skip any mornings; she never knew which day might be the one when she'd find herself back in 1927.
 When she went downstairs, Rick was watching television.
 "Want to watch `Bonanza'?"
 he asked.
 "OK." He glanced at her, bemused, when she sat down on the far end of the sofa.

‚ÄúGood morning.‚Äù He nodded as he spoke, his voice as smooth as velvet.
 I managed to snap my slack jaw shut at the same moment I realized I had angled my body toward him when he‚Äôd addressed me.
 I mentally cursed, but I could recover this; I would just keep going in the same direction as if I were on my way to town, because I was on my way to town.
 There was no need for him to know it was to research someone associated with the Council.
 Someone like him.
 I tried to respond to his greeting, but felt choked and instead only nodded back, my mouth tight as I endeavored to grin with a now clenched jaw.
 I groaned internally, keeping on the path, not daring to look back in case he was behind me.
 I was convinced he was.
 He wouldn‚Äôt be taking the back way to Junnie‚Äôs as I had come, and he wouldn‚Äôt be leaving the village without a pack; he was likely going to a Council meeting.
 Yes, he was certainly right behind me, following me into town.

 ‚ÄúThe men are ready, milord,‚Äù Sergan said.
 ‚ÄúDo we march?‚Äù
 Antonil stared at the small town, seeing very little motion within.
 No people wandered the streets.
 No traveling merchants hawked their wares.
 He sighed and turned to Sergan, his trusted advisor in war.
 The man was old, scarred, and had dirty hair falling down to his shoulders.
 He had seen many wars, and the axe against his shoulder had claimed more than a few lives.
 ‚ÄúYes, let us end this, one way or the other,‚Äù Antonil said.

The throne room was full.
 And not one of them did not gasp when comprehension hit.
 But my father, and each of those present, seemed‚Ä¶ pleased when they saw me.
 They had no idea there was a‚Ä¶ human‚Ä¶ growing in the belly my hands now cradled.
 I listened as their voices began, and then rose, clamorously discussing the news and what it could bring.
 I cringed as their words turned to the possibilities, the power I might pass down, the strength the new one might bring.
 ‚ÄúWe will leave at daybreak,‚Äù Grey informed Ruby as I read.
 Perfect.
 The news brought on nothing but worry, so I went back to the book.
 Eventually, my father did seek to find out who the father was.

 Somehow I made it to the library without tripping or looking back, though I was nearly overcome with the temptation to turn at the door to see him one more time.
 The library steps curled around the interior of the tree, shelves cut into every space above and below, tables and racks and patrons scattered about the remaining areas.
 I found a dark, empty corner on the third level and relaxed onto a seat, leaning against the inside wall of the old tree and taking in the scent of ancient paper and binding.
 After a momentary pause to blot out the latest incident of poor self-control, I decided to attempt to locate the missing pages by magic.
 I had, after all, succeeded in growing only days ago.
 I concentrated as hard as I could and, though nothing flitted out of the shelves and onto my desk, I had a strong feeling I knew where the documents were.
 It also could have been that I knew where they had fallen from the day before.
 Regardless, I made my way over and took a few volumes and scrolls back to my secluded table.

My newfound height put me closer to Alec's ear.
 I only had to tug on his arm a little bit to get him down to where I could whisper to him.
 "That was you, wasn't it?"
 "What if it was?"
 "It's too much.
 I mean it's really nice, incredibly gorgeous in fact, but it must have cost you a fortune."
 Alec shrugged.
 "A paltry sum if it helps ensure a perfect night for you."
 "You've done so much.
 I mean the dress, the shoes, and now this.

Harruq felt his temples throb.
 A wail rolled over him as a deathly comet swirled about, spotting the two and eying them like prey.
 Try as he might, he couldn‚Äôt stop from shaking.
 ‚ÄúCan you stop them?‚Äù Harruq asked, squinting at the sky.
 ‚ÄúPerhaps,‚Äù said Qurrah, eyes distant and unfocused.
 ‚ÄúBut orcs don‚Äôt use necromancy, not if the stories I‚Äôve heard are true.
 Someone else travels with them‚Äîsomeone who must be strong.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWhen it comes to this mind stuff, no one‚Äôs stronger than you.‚Äù

Night gave the gray stones an even darker appearance, the firelight glinting off their ragged edges like polished onyx.
 Torches lit each walkway and building.
 It seemed late, but several villagers were still outside, loud and boisterous.
 Nearly everyone dressed in black, a few of the men bearing large silver breastplates or wrist cuffs.
 Most wore leather, laced tight against thick, muscled frames.
 Few were thin or as petite as the elves I was used to seeing.
 These were strong, like Chevelle and Steed.
 All had dark hair as well.
 And then there was red hair.

Global military spending has fallen by nearly 50 per cent since 1994 to $400 billion per annum (in 1990 US dollars), half of which is now contributed to a global military force responsible for enforcing a total ban on war between nations.
 Not a single inter-state or civil war is raging due to the extension of the UN's mandate to prevent all forms of war and its vastly strengthened military capabilities.
 International drug trafficking has declined by more than 80 per cent since the signing of the UN declaration granting the UN special powers to eradicate the drugs trade.
 An accelerated schedule for dismantling trade barriers and the formation of regional economic unions, such as the Middle East Economic Area that incorporates Israel and the Arab states, and other initiatives to promote larger bilateral trade between countries and regions, have helped to more than double the growth rate in world trade.
 With the assistance of the UN's World Development Force, proposed in this report, food shortages have been eliminated from the last famine danger zones in Africa, and total food production on that continent has doubled within a decade.
 Poverty is its direct forms has been eradicated in China and India by strategies that have led to the creation of hundreds of millions of new jobs.
 Rapid economic growth in developing countries has acted as a powerful engine for vigorous expansion among the industrialized nations.
 In partial fulfilment of their common commitment to generate Full Employment Economies, the member states of the OECD have announced that unemployment in industrialized countries has dropped to the lowest level in half a century.
 Most of the nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia have achieved a significant measure of political and economic stability combined with unexpectedly high growth rates ranging from 5 to 10 per cent.
 This region has emerged as an important source of trade and economic growth for the industrial nations.

They did not have much time before Velixar‚Äôs dark cloud arrived.
 They could not rush, but nor could they dawdle.
 Qurrah inhaled deeply and began casting his spell.
 The words of magic were similar to those when he raised the eight corpses back in Cornrows.
 The bigger half-orc was aware of subtle differences, but had little clue to what they were.
 Words of power were beyond his understanding.
 The body quivered, but it was not a physical quiver.
 Translucent silver crept about the wraps.
 Blue smoke floated into the air.
 The blue and silver grew thicker and thicker.

 Harruq nodded.

 Qurrah stared at the name, thinking.
 ‚ÄúHe was an elf,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúI guess it is possible he was our father, although I feel it more likely a coincidence.
 Our mother was intelligent, at least for an orc, but was she smart enough to leave us clues within our own names?‚Äù

Les Mis√©rables.
 I managed to put the impending drawing more or less out of my mind for the first half of the day, but I actually missed Britney's constant gossip.
 There was almost no redeeming value to most of what she said, but it did have the benefit of being distracting.
 By the time lunch finally came around I needed some kind of distraction.
 This was my only chance to see Les Mis√©rables performed live before I turned forty.
 Unfortunately, while the conversation at Brandon's table was plentiful, it wasn't very distracting.
 I was quickly realizing that Brandon's friends weren't very nice.
 I'd pretty much known Cassie was a wench, but Vincent seemed even meaner.
 While a story about how someone tricked some poor girl into thinking he was going to ask her out was highly illuminating, it wasn't particularly the kind of thing I wanted to dwell on.
 Especially considering how many parallels there were between her story, and mine.

Since second grade.
 All through elementary school, she was always the smartest in class, and kinder than anybody else I knew.
 She spent eighth grade in my mom's English and Social Studies class.
 Later my mom called her the brightest student she ever taught.
 And her pure and soulful singing would land her, only months after high school, on a weekly television show with a folk group, The Good Time Singers.
 That summer before our senior year, Margaret's best friend was Pam Greenman, who attended our rival high school.
 Lane was someone I probably never would've befriended if not for Eric.
 Since we met in seventh grade, I had considered Lane a smart-mouthed little pest while he thought of me as a big, dumb oaf.
 In Eric's company, we each learned better.
 I have Eric's treasures, which Sylvia gave me.

‚ÄúBecause he has rejected us, my disciple,‚Äù Velixar said.
 ‚ÄúHis strength has left him.
 My heart burns with this betrayal, and I must know who to punish.‚Äù
 Qurrah felt ill at ease.
 All around him, the sea of undead swayed and moaned as if they shared their master‚Äôs anger.
 ‚ÄúPerhaps it is a mistake,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúOr he has done so only to keep himself safe.
 Let me talk to him.
 He will listen to me; he always has.‚Äù
 Velixar shook his head and pointed toward Woodhaven in the far distance.

 The flaming whip appeared, charring grass as it touched the ground.
 ‚ÄúThen what do you want with me?‚Äù the man shrieked.

 The eyes of the nobleman grew wider, and panic gripped him entirely.
 ‚ÄúNo, no you can‚Äôt.
 You wouldn‚Äôt!
 Please, I beg of you, don‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù
 ‚ÄúEnough,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 His hand reached out, the tips of his fingers brushing the sides of the man‚Äôs face.

 The Tun brothers did not go straight home that night.
 Harruq veered them off into the grassy hills south of Woodhaven.
 ‚ÄúWhy do we go this way?‚Äù Qurrah asked, his arm draped around his brother.
 His sagging body seemed ready to collapse into slumber at any time.
 ‚ÄúI need to retrieve the swords I dropped,‚Äù Harruq said quietly.
 ‚ÄúI want to train with them.‚Äù
 Qurrah nodded so absently that Harruq wondered if his brother even heard him.

Between cities, I plug in my I-pod.
 What goes in comes out.
 If I listen to a love song, these days I‚Äôll probably wish for a loving companion.
 If I turn on a radio talk show, I usually want to argue.
 Those pastimes aren‚Äôt good for me.
 So, on long trips in my old Toyota I listen to hymns, gospel music and such.
 As I set off on this trip, half book promotion tour and half vacation, I‚Äôm wrestling with Brother Lawrence and the question, why don‚Äôt I adore God?
 I plan to drive up the West Coast, San Diego to Seattle, and stop over with Cliff Torrey in Atascadero and Bob Williams in Portland.
 Lots of years ago, I attended a Billy Graham crusade with these two friends.
 I listened, got moved, and turned to Christ.

"I don't know.
 Things were already pretty tense.
 That's probably where Alec is right now actually.
 Brandon's people are always skirting around the edge of our territory, but tonight they'll be out in greater numbers than normal.
 If things don't boil over now, it's pretty much guaranteed that there will be some kind of confrontation Monday at school."
 The word confrontation reached out and grabbed me.
 It took a second before I realized it was dragging up memories of the near-fight between Alec and half his pack.
 "What happened last night...it was for real, wasn't it?"
 Rachel didn't ask what I meant; she didn't even bat an eye.

Give us half an hour, and then ask Donovan to show you the way."
 I felt my face break into a huge smile, but he held a hand up to forestall my thanks.
 "This is all still very much against my better judgment, but I'm finding it increasingly hard to refuse you the things you want the most."
 "Somehow I find that hard to believe.
 Even if it were true, you're hardly the type to give away the upper hand by coming out and telling me so."
 Alec's eyes had taken on the serious, resigned expression that'd become disturbingly commonplace lately.
 "I know.
 I think that last part bothers me the most, but I find myself doing so nevertheless.
 Make sure you wait at least half an hour.
 There's a definite element of danger to all of this."

Education and training must become a life-long process for workers.
 In a number of countries, high levels of unemployment coexist with shortages of particular skills, reflecting significant mismatches between supply and demand for skills.
 The deficiencies in government-operated training programmes can be partially overcome by providing greater incentives to private firms to invest in training new and existing employees.
 Studies have found that a 10 per cent increase in expenditure on training can boost productivity by an average of 3 per cent over two years and by as much as 30 times the cost of training.
 Yet even today, only a relatively small number of companies conduct regular, ongoing training programmes.
 Launch a nationwide public educational programme on the tremendous potential gains in productivity from increased training.
 Support initiatives by providing incentives to intensify training programmes for all employees by every type of commercial and non-commercial institution in order systemati cally to upgrade the technical, vocational, organizational and managerial skills of the workforce.
 10.School-to-work apprenticeship programmes: The transition from school or college to work can be long and difficult.
 Germany's apprenticeship programme equips nearly 70 per cent of all teenagers with employable skills before they enter the workforce.
 Two-thirds of the UK workforce have no vocational or professional qualification, compared with only 25 per cent in Germany.

I didn‚Äôt have a driver‚Äôs license yet, but I had a learner‚Äôs permit.
 I had no car and I walked, bummed a ride or hitchhiked if I needed to get someplace like work or high school.
 It was not easy living on my own and finding roommates at such a young age, but I managed.
 After a short stint of crashing on couches or extra bedrooms of several friends, I rented a room at a house with some other kids near my age.
 I was still in high school and I wanted to graduate, but I also needed money to live on.
 Rent, food, utilities and various expenses were all new to me.
 The father of my girlfriend Lori was an executive of a supermarket chain, and he made some calls and got me an interview.
 The manager explained to me that he would love to hire me but he had a hiring freeze on everyone but minorities.
 I had no idea what this meant so I asked, and he explained to me all the types of minorities that he could hire, including, American Indian.
 I said, ‚ÄúHey, my grandfather was half American Indian,‚Äù and he hired me on the spot.

The guard tried to shrug him off, his bearded face looked afraid.
 His eyes, a light blue, stared at Rodregas with revulsion.
 He was probably wondering how Rodregas could be strong enough to take on an Immortal Guard.
 Rodregas knew from the guard‚Äôs fear that he had him, he was not thinking clearly.
 Rodregas growled at him, letting him feel his anger and rage at taking slaves to be used by the Immortalists.
 Rodregas had seen what would happen to them.
 He had suffered for years with a subtle kind of inner rot at letting the evil continue.
 In all the ways that mattered Rodregas knew he was no better than this man, he had spent most of his life as a slaver.
 Rodregas had no moral grounds on which to kill these men, but inside of him there was no mercy.
 He had crossed a line and could no longer live with the evil.

A vine wrapped my shoulder, jerking me back.
 I was trapped.
 I looked to Ruby, but she could not help me now.
 Beyond her, a line of long flowing robes marched through the mist‚Ä¶ coming for us.
 The sight gave me strength, or courage, or blinding stupidity.
 I didn‚Äôt know, but I went with it with everything I had.
 I was trapped against the wall, unable to move, but there was one thing I could do.
 The sun broke through the clouds and I saw precisely what I needed.
 A shadow crossed the ground in front of us, a hawk flying overhead.
 The corner of my mouth pulled up in a smile as I closed my eyes to join him.

It wasn‚Äôt hard to find because of its new size, but if I hadn‚Äôt been half expecting, half fearing the excessive growth, I might not have recognized it.
 Each of the strains I had grown the day Evelyn choked was flourishing.
 Noxious weeds were taking over the meadow.
 As I stood there, frozen before this changed garden, I was overwhelmed by the scene, overtaken by emotion, and had to press my eyes closed.
 Light rain began to fall and I raised my head to the sky, drawing in a deep breath.
 The cool water trickled down my face, calming the heat of my pulse.
 But it didn‚Äôt clear my head.
 I still couldn‚Äôt understand.
 A painful fear shot through me, and I tilted my head forward to run through the growth.
 Vines, thorns and leaves turned to muddy ash as they touched my outstretched arms, wet with rain.

An usher finally arrived to see what all of the commotion was about.
 The older boys shook themselves and then looked for a second like they were going to try and get Alec kicked out of the theater.
 The sense of being caught in some kind of electric sandstorm momentarily intensified, and then faded away as they got up and left.
 I felt my mouth drop open again as they scurried out of the theater without once looking back.
 Alec, who I'd always figured had the depth of an old-style Mickey Mouse cartoon, had just faced down two older boys, and singlehandedly saved my Les Mis√©rables experience.
 Valjean launched into 'Who am I?
 ', and almost against my will I was pulled back around to where I could see the stage.
 Even as enthralled as I was by the music, I made a mental note to thank Alec after the performance.
 For once I wasn't going to try and get the best of him verbally, I was just going to walk up and thank him.
 The sense of being able to feel Alec behind me didn't diminish during the course of the play, if anything it gradually increased almost to the levels it'd been during the face-off with the college boys.

Harruq shrugged.
 ‚ÄúYou need me?‚Äù
 The smaller half-orc opened the bag he carried.
 Inside were ashes, roots, herbs, and a sharpened knife: all Qurrah needed to work his art.
 ‚ÄúNo.
 You may go.‚Äù
 Harruq rose, glanced at the body, and then departed.

 ‚ÄúWhat are they looking at?‚Äù Harruq later asked as the two brothers walked down the winding streets of Woodhaven.

‚ÄúYou were bound.‚Äù Bound?
 The word was so foreign in that context.
 All I could think of was the young children in the village, binding themselves to play the games of fairy children, who were unmagical until coming of age.
 I recalled seeing it in the documents in the briar patch‚ÄîFrancine Glaforia, bound against using all but practical magic.
 Bound.
 They must have known not to trust me.
 They must have known.
 My knees gave out and I crumpled to the ground.
 How many times could the earth be pulled from beneath my feet?
 Chevelle took a step toward me and I held up a hand to stop him.

"Um, yeah.
 We just got into town last night."
 He handed me the bottle of water.
 "Well I hope you'll like it here."
 "Wait, what's this for?"
 The grin was back, and his teeth were still perfect.
 "I just made you spill yours, it's only fair."
 Brandon nodded at Britney, who stood there with her mouth slightly open, as he walked away.
 After a second or two of both of us staring blankly after Brandon, Britney grabbed me by the hand, the one holding the new, unopened water bottle, and pulled me over to a table in the corner.
 "Oh my gosh, you just poured water all over Brandon Worthingfield the Third.

‚ÄúI was heading to Bray and ran across some trackers.‚Äù Chevelle‚Äôs eyes flicked to my face and then back to Steed.
 Steed dropped his hands from my waist as he winked at me.
 ‚ÄúI saw the horses out front and couldn‚Äôt resist.
 Knew you‚Äôd be missing me.‚Äù I tried to smile, but the thought of trackers had taken the thrill off the unexpected visit.
 The vision of flames was threatening again and I swallowed hard.
 Chevelle threw on his cloak, hood up.
 ‚ÄúStay here,‚Äù he ordered me.
 He gestured toward Steed, who turned to follow him outside.
 I wasn‚Äôt sure how long they‚Äôd be gone; I went to one of the narrow windows on the front wall and peered cautiously out.
 They were nowhere to be seen, but the sights of the village distracted me quickly enough.

 Rick wanted to seize the opportunity and led her toward a frozen yogurt stand so that they could sit down and talk.
 "I bet you don't have frozen yogurt in 1927."
 "No," she replied, intrigued.
 "What is it?"
 "It's like ice cream but better for you.
 The flavors are on that board.

 But I am, for want of a better word, religious.
 That‚Äôs me.
 Is this the norm and people find it better to simply not talk about it?

We're only halfway there."
 As I opened my mouth to respond, Vincent turned off the road onto a trail that hardly looked wide enough for a Geo Metro let alone his monster truck.
 I let out a yelp as we dropped down a small hill and then started climbing up the other side of the gully with a small bounce.
 Brandon chuckled at me, but shifted position enough to brace himself against the two beer kegs, and then reached out and wrapped an arm around me.
 A couple of the girls who'd been looking especially condescending over my surprise as we'd gone off-road were now obviously disappointed.
 They were probably wishing it was them instead of me cradled against Brandon's yummy chest.
 I tried not to radiate too much contentment, but rather suspected I failed.
 Vincent wasn't really driving any faster than before, but the fact that we were going up and down slopes I wouldn't have thought could be driven made his current speed reckless.
 Even with Brandon's arm stopping me from flying out of the pickup, I still had a couple of moments where my heart shot up to the top of my throat.
 He of course remained frustratingly calm, even when we hit a bump with enough force to nearly send everyone flying out of the bed.

The half-orc halted, turned, and sat back down.
 His face was still beet red but the elf paid it no mind.

 ‚ÄúNo interrupting, and no saying a thing.

 Don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm telling you this.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúBecause you must,‚Äù she said, a bit of her stubbornness returning.
 ‚ÄúBecause I need to know.‚Äù
 The half-orc nodded.
 He began his story.

 ‚ÄúWill we strike the elves?‚Äù Qurrah asked.

 The half-orc laughed.
 ‚ÄúMother was an orc who had lived here in Woodhaven.
 I do not know her name, other than what she instructed my brother and I to call her: Mama Tun.
 Our father was from Woodhaven, she told us.
 We later found out he was an elf, bizarre as it seems.‚Äù

I felt a more genuine smile working its way across my face.
 "Could we go to one of them?
 I really should be doing my homework, but I'd much rather just curl up with a good book."
 Donovan picked up the cell phone that I, unsure whether or not it was really mine, had left on the bed, and handed it to me.
 "I believe you'll want to keep this with you at all times.
 Otherwise it won't be able to fulfill its assigned purpose.
 And yes, we can most definitely go to one of the libraries.
 In fact, I believe you'll find the smaller one quite satisfactory.
 It has a copy of every textbook currently in use at your high school, in case you reconsider."
 There were more turns than I had any hope of ever remembering, but eventually we made it to a familiar-looking door.

He closed his eyes.
 Tears trickled down his face.
 He felt the anger growing inside him, but he forced it down.
 In his mind‚Äôs eye, he saw Velixar.
 The old prophet warned of death, retribution, and pain, but Harruq silenced him.
 Let the gift be gone.
 He denied the darkness within him.
 If this was betrayal, then so be it.
 He would pay the cost.
 Great spasms racked his body.

International assistance is also needed for coping with tensions arising from the sharing of natural resources ‚Äì particularly water resources ‚Äì and chemical or radioactive pollution of air, soil and waterways.
 Resolution of these issues requires the mediation of international experts for impartial assessment and formulation of equitable recommendations.
 Regional security organizations can play a leading role in this capacity.
 An effective international judicial system is vitally important to the expanded role contemplated for the UN in dealing with arms and drugs trafficking, terrorism and crimes against humanity.
 This requires, as a minimum step, either that the International Court of Justice be granted mandatory jurisdiction over such cases by member states, or that an International Criminal Court be established with jurisdiction over these offences and other crimes under international law, thus strengthening both the preventive and enforcement capabilities of the international community against non-traditional threats to security.
 Alternative Use of Military Resources
 National and international security can no longer be conceived in narrow military terms.
 Ethnic conflict, drugs, environmental degradation and pollution, famine leading to civil unrest or massive migrations of refugees, high levels of unemployment, urban crime and violence constitute threats to both social stability and the preservation of a productive material base.
 Curbing drug traffic, preventing nuclear and chemical contamination, stopping soil degradation and deforestation, augmenting food production capabilities in deficit areas ‚Äì all directly and substantially contribute to the security of society.
 The attention given to the anticipated monetary savings from reduced military spending has directed attention away from the potential benefits of utilizing other resources controlled by the military for addressing these threats to security, particularly for the alleviation of poverty, protection and restoration of the environment, and management of natural disasters.

He doubled over, hacking and coughing.
 His breath was raspy and weak.
 ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù he insisted.
 ‚ÄúTake me from the wall.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlright then,‚Äù Harruq said, grabbing his brother‚Äôs arm.
 ‚ÄúJust hold tight.‚Äù
 He leapt off the roof, pulling Qurrah with him.
 As his feet smacked the hard ground, his knees buckled and he fell back, catching his brother as he did.
 Without a word of thanks, Qurrah stepped off him and leaned against the wall.
 His whole body shuddered.
 He had often looked into the darkness.

With a shudder, he relaxed again, and Jessica approached, dropping to her stomach to crawl the last little ways, and then rolling onto her back.
 James dropped down on all fours, grounding the wicked-looking claws tipping his hands, and then it seemed all was forgiven.
 My suspicions were confirmed when Dom sighed with relief.
 It hadn't just been my imagination.
 Alec's will had been sufficient to the task, but its victory hadn't been assured.
 It was a terrible risk to run, one that apparently put a big fat target on his chest for anyone in the pack who wasn't happy with how things were currently running, but Alec ran it regardless.
 He ran it again and again because doing so gave his pack a slight chance of survival, and he couldn't deny them that chance, not when there was something he could do to put it within their reach.
 That wasn't the kind of person who'd take advantage of my human weakness to seduce me.
 In fact, it was all too likely he was going to fight my every effort to bring us closer together precisely because he didn't want to take advantage of me.
 I was suddenly very certain though that I was going to wage that war.

He started to jump up as a humanoid shape appeared out of the trees, until he saw that it was just Imeralda.
 She seemed to be paying less attention now to stealth as she was to speed.
 From Imeralda‚Äôs expression Rodregas knew it was something more dangerous than a trade caravan coming down the road.
 Imeralda squatted down next to them and whispered, ‚ÄúA slave caravan is coming; it‚Äôs small but they have a score of guards.
 We need to back up before they get here.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have good cover here,‚Äù he whispered back, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs check them out as they pass.
 They are probably going to stop at Stallion‚Äôs Perch.‚Äù After much debate between the three of them Stallion‚Äôs Perch was their destination, a small keep that was known to breed Dire horses for the Immortal Guard.
 ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt,‚Äù responded Imeralda with a whisper.
 ‚ÄúThey are traveling with a patrol of Immortal guards.
 I think there are only four, but scout patrols often have a warrior with a minor sigil of enhanced senses.
 He might spot us.‚Äù As she spoke Rodregas noticed that Imeralda had a strange expression on her face, she was scared, but also seemed sad.

Things weren't ideal; I'd never met a group with so many inside jokes.
 Half the time I felt like there was an entire conversation being carried on over my head, but sitting next to Brandon left me with such a tingly feeling all along my right side that I didn't really mind.
 Not even the presence of a pop quiz in History managed to faze me.
 Almost before I knew it I was sitting down in Physics.
 As usual, Alec slipped into class a half second before the bell.
 I was so happy I forgot how arrogant he was, and I smiled at him as he sat down.
 It was like he was looking at something that wasn't even human.
 My insides seemed to freeze and shrink.
 I couldn't even muster up my normal blush of embarrassment.
 I'd had plenty of people hate me since I'd arrived in Sanctuary, but he was the first person I'd met who I was convinced wouldn't have thrown me a life preserver if I was drowning.

 Briefly he considered trying again to kiss her but instead took a lock of her hair to play with.

 "Anyway, today alone has been a perfect date."
 "What do you mean?"
 "Breakfast in bed, washing my car, now watching TV."
 "You call that a date?"

He followed a servant dressed in expensive silks of a drab brown color through the well lit passageways and stairs, all the while nervously straightening his own expensive wardrobe.
 As they approached the top of the tower, the servant silently stepped aside and, with an open palm, waived Van‚Äôdret forward.
 The top of the stairs had a small platform where two massive Immortal Guards stood.
 At first they showed no signs of movement, though Van‚Äôdret could feel their eyes on him as they weighed his right to enter the private solar of their master.
 In their full plate Night Bronze, the two guardsmen who stood perfectly still at full attention looked to be more statues than actual men, and something that was not beyond the magic of the man was whose door they guarded.
 The double doors leading to the private solar were also of Night Bronze, however the door was covered in intricate wards and symbols.
 The guardsmen's armor was less decorated and held only an engraving of their sigil animals.
 The guard on the right had an engraving on his Pauldrons, the piece of armor that protects his shoulders of the Celestial beast know as The Stag while the man on the left had an engraving of The Mastiff.
 After a moment, that seemed to stretch longer than was polite, the Immortal Guard to the right slowly nodded and with no hand touching it; the two massive doors opened to welcome him into the sanctum.
 Van‚Äôdret hurried through the open doors before the guard changed his mind.

He loved being with Marie, but he had to remember that she was going back to 1927.
 The closer he felt to her, the more he‚Äôd miss her when she was gone.

 Marie had emerged from the dressing room carrying the black and pink suit.
 Rick looked up, managing a smile.

 He noticed that she'd bound her breasts again.
 "Listen, Marie, there are a couple of other things I want you to get."
 "What?"

Then the brother gods came.
 Ashhur of Justice, Karak of Order.
 There are many worlds beyond our own, Qurrah.
 I have seen fleeting glimpses of them in my dreams.
 Karak and Ashhur came from one of those worlds, and Celestia welcomed them.
 To them she gave the grasslands and rolling hills.
 ‚ÄúThese brother gods did not make their own creation.
 Instead, they made man, much the same as man existed in their former world.
 They wanted to make a paradise, one of justice and order.
 The world they came from was full of chaos, death, and murder.

 She's been telling me for years now that I have the potential to develop a fairly spectacular gift, one that should it choose to manifest in a useful form, could be more than a match for Brandon's strength.
 Apparently I'm still right on the point of developing said gift, only our time has run out.
 I fight Brandon tonight.
 Besides, even if I were to develop a gift this instant, most of them require practice to master, and I'm not going to have a chance to do any of that."
 "I'm sorry.

 Alec stopped and tugged me around to face him.
 "Don't be sorry.

Apparently my astonishment leaked through to my expression, that or maybe she could just smell the shock on me.
 Whatever the reason, her smile took on new intensity, and she slowly reached out and clasped my hand again.
 "I'm sorry; I spend so much of my time alone with my thoughts that they develop well-worn grooves.
 I forget sometimes that other people haven't been privy to the endless hours of speculation that got me from one point to another."
 There was something about her touch that distracted me.
 Not in a bad way, almost like the tickle you get in the back of your mind when you know you're missing out on some key point of plot in a suspense novel.
 "You glow much more brightly than any human I've ever met, but you don't feel like a shape shifter, so you're either a very powerful Fir'shan, one strong enough to mask your nature from Alec, as well as me, or you're a very extraordinary human.
 Alec wouldn't have brought you here until he was sure it was the latter."
 I closed my mouth in astonishment.
 "I didn't realize Alec had talked to anyone about me.

The UN Secretary General has rightly drawn attention to the worldwide crisis in development economics and called the need for new thinking on development ‚Äòthe most important intellectual challenge of the coming years‚Äô.
 Until now development has been largely a haphazard, subconscious or half-conscious process of trial and error experimentation, an application of partial strategies, a confusing mixture of productive and counter-productive initiatives, an unscientific and often superstitious clinging to half-truths or old-truths that no longer have any relevance.
 Development is not merely a set of goals or programmes.
 It is a social process by which human beings become mentally aware of new opportunities and challenges, conceive of ideas, create inventions, release their energy and enthusiasm for achievement, and acquire the skills and organizational capacities for action.
 A better understanding of that process will enable us to avoid the errors and tardiness of past efforts and accomplish in the next few decades what might otherwise take centuries.
 The world possesses sufficient experience and information to formulate a comprehensive and integrated theory of development as a social process.
 The theory should explain the process by which human society has developed to where it is today, the forces which propel its growth, and the stages of its past and future progress.
 It should be based on the perception that the political, economic and social life of human kind is a single, inseparable whole and, therefore, that comprehensive, total strategies must be applied to resolve our problems, because partial strategies lead to partial solutions which disturb the harmony of the whole, generating unwanted side-effects.
 This knowledge should be utilized to formulate a model of development that is based on the internal dynamics of the process rather than on its external manifestations or extrapolation of future trends from past data.

Rodregas pushed on through the night and into the sunrise of the next day until even the horse that had been Korin‚Äôs ride, which he had tied to the back of the wagon, seemed to be tired and ready for rest.
 He stopped and let the animals take a break next to a small creek.
 Rodregas was not sure what would happen when the relief guards went to the tower and found the other guards tied up, apparently by Ravenhurr himself.
 His assistant had been killed in the Master‚Äôs own room.
 Rodregas reasoned they would find the keep partially pillaged as well.
 He knew Captain Poir would probably do one of two things: either come after him immediately or head to the Celestial Path Guild Hall in the capital.
 If Captain Poir headed immediately for the Guild Hall to report the strange happening, it would give him more time to find a place to lie low.
 However, it would be better for him if Poir went looking for Rodregas himself instead, and spread his men all over trying to find him.
 There were only about twenty Ravenhurr guardsmen.
 If they were sent in every possible direction, especially in pairs, there was a good chance that he would come across no more than two of them at a time.

We admired Russell‚Äôs smug attitude, the gall of a fellow who accused Christ of utter arrogance for counting people vipers simply because they disapproved of his preaching.
 We delighted in Russell's arguments that Christianity was the principal enemy of moral progress in the world.
 Dismiss Christ, trust ourselves, we would discover the solution.
 Simple.
 After a couple of Russell‚Äôs books, Eric brought home Thus Spoke Zarathustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche, a strangely enchanting poet.
 Zarathustra claimed that some of us could become supermen.
 First, our spirits would need to brave the desert like camels, forsaking our past, our heritage, all the values of common people.
 Once we had finished forsaking, we would metamorphose into lions and proceed to slay the dragon called "Thou Shalt".
 After burying the dragon, the lion would die and resurrect as a child, the infant superman, innocent and forgiving, a new beginning, a sacred Yes.
 Then, we could discover and assert our own wills, and use those wills to conquer and change the world.

Qurrah laughed.
 ‚ÄúHe lost,‚Äù he said, pointing to the night sky.
 ‚ÄúAnd he doesn‚Äôt know how badly.‚Äù
 One by one, the skulls‚Äô fire went out and they fell like morbid hail upon the city.
 ‚ÄúLimitless,‚Äù Qurrah said, his smile trembling.
 Blood ran from his nose, and his skin was so pale Harruq could see his veins.
 ‚ÄúThe well is limitless.‚Äù
 His eyes rolled into his head.
 Without another word, he collapsed.
 He dreamt of fire poured into flesh and a man whose eyes were glass.

"No, he was very clear on that point.
 You're not to know.
 That's the one thing guaranteed to make him go through with his threats.
 You'll just have to be satisfied with the fact that you'll both continue to be able to live in our fine city."
 Normally I would have just acquiesced, but I couldn't bear the thought of letting him leave, taking with him the identity of the only person besides my mom who really cared what happened to me.
 I tightened my grip in an attempt to stop him.
 "Please, if you won't tell me who it is, let me write a thank you note.
 I have to do something.
 He's done so much for us."
 He stopped partway through shaking his head.

Jordaan then said, ‚ÄúThis is going to hurt, it will feel like someone is drawing a pattern under your skin with a knife.
 If you pull away before it is done, you will mess up the pattern and it will use up your magic without adding the benefits of the sigil.‚Äù As Jordaan finished speaking he looked in Rodregas‚Äô eyes until he nodded his understanding.
 He knew what was coming.
 He could feel Jordaan‚Äôs magic start to pour into his hands and into the frog.
 A sensation emanating from the frog began to fill his senses.
 Without Rodregas‚Äô conscious will, his own magic raised from the core of his being.
 The two magic forces seemed to mix and then enter the frog.
 They seemed to pour from the frog back into his own body.
 That power felt like a thousand small knives digging into his flesh.
 His body tightened and he could feel Jordaan‚Äôs hands hold him firm.

Salvation swung around, ringing against the blade.
 Condemnation followed through, aimed straight for the guard‚Äôs throat.
 He ducked underneath the swing, feeling the air of the cut just inches above his head.
 Then he was up, both hands gripping his sword tightly.
 Harruq came charging in, both swords striking.
 The guard parried one after the other, constantly retreating.
 The others came to his aid, swinging careful, tentative blows.
 All three tried to engage without being put at risk, much like men prodding a bull.
 Of course, the result was similar.
 The bull got madder.

Maybe I was just hoping to kill two birds with one stone.
 It wasn't until she was finally in the Jeep and backing down our lane that I finally stopped worrying that Brandon was going to pop around the corner.
 He'd been smugly confident he wouldn't show up before she was gone, but had refused to tell me how he planned on pulling up at my house five minutes after the coast was clear.
 Half of me was strongly tempted to dawdle for fifteen or twenty minutes, but with my luck he'd really manage to show up within the next few minutes, and I'd have to scramble to get ready while he waited for me.
 With a sigh I ran up to the bathroom, brushed my teeth, gave my hair the once-over, and grabbed a light jacket as I left my room.
 It wasn't even remotely as cold here as I would be at home by this late in the year, but the oppressive heat had finally started to wane a little.
 Knowing my luck, if I left it home tonight would be the first time it snowed in Sanctuary in the last two centuries.
 More and more excited about the prospect of going to my first real party, I bounced down the stairs and into the kitchen for a drink.
 I happened to look out the window as I pulled a glass out of the cupboard, and nearly dropped it when I saw Brandon leaning against his car, patiently waiting for me.
 Before I could move out of sight, he looked up at me with a self-satisfied smile.

With a visible effort of will, Jasmin closed her eyes, calmed her shaking body, and then turned and quickly walked out of the room.
 I was just tall enough to see over Rachel and take in what was going on in the rest of the room.
 James' eyes were still yellow, and he was still inching his way towards me, obviously undeterred by Jasmin's defection.
 The Hispanic girl carefully closed the distance between them, and then placed her slender, perfect dark hand on James' arm once again as she leaned in and whispered something in his ear.
 For a moment it seemed he was going to shake her off again but then he shuddered, shot Alec another dirty look, and stormed out of the room.
 The tiny form following after him looked like a fragile schooner trailing along the edge of a hurricane.
 The room seemed so calm after James disappeared that for a second I forgot Jessica was still half-crouched in the center of the room.
 Alec hadn't forgotten, and if the waves of tension and energy rolling off of him weren't as strong as the combined effects coming from all four of them, it still felt like the walls should explode outwards.
 Jessica seemed to shrink in on herself, and then she turned and ran away with a final hiss of defiance.
 Isaac looked up at Alec from the corner where he'd been quietly standing.

But I know we humans can talk ourselves into or out of most anything.
 Books
 One reason I decided to arrange a book signing in Seattle was so I could visit Jaime and Mark Baird and meet their one-year-old Gavin.
 Not long ago, Mark did a tour as an Army psychologist in Iraq.
 Jaime recently earned a Master of Arts degree from Perelandra College, which Pam and I founded about eight years ago, and which I essentially run.
 The college is one of the occupations that keeps me rushing around, the condition that originally clued me I should read Brother Lawrence.
 Pam and I believed God was asking us to found the college to make a place for people in general and Christians in particular who wanted to become writers to discover what they honestly believe, and to write with courage from their unique visions.
 Thinking of Jaime, I can‚Äôt begin to lament the virtually endless hurdles we've been called upon to jump in order to earn and maintain the college‚Äôs licensing, accreditation and the rest.
 Jaime's thesis is superb.
 A novella about a young woman whose Christian parents, when their daughter finds herself in extreme trouble, appear more concerned with remaining in accord with their church than with helping or even trying to understand their daughter.

"Please don't cry, sweetheart," he pleaded, kissing her hair.
 He opened his mouth to tell her that she might not even be able to get back, since she'd been unsuccessful so far.
 But that would just hurt her more.
 Still, the thought calmed his own turbulent feelings.
 When her tears were exhausted, Marie rested quietly in Rick's arms.
 If they had been in 1927, everything would be different.
 Rick was so much warmer, so much more thoughtful and loving and fun than Davis.
 She would never have given Davis a second glance if she'd known Rick in 1927.
 At last she sat up.
 "I need to go wash my face."

All through elementary school, she was always the smartest in class, and kinder than anybody else I knew.
 She spent eighth grade in my mom's English and Social Studies class.
 Later my mom called her the brightest student she ever taught.
 And her pure and soulful singing would land her, only months after high school, on a weekly television show with a folk group, The Good Time Singers.
 That summer before our senior year, Margaret's best friend was Pam Greenman, who attended our rival high school.
 Lane was someone I probably never would've befriended if not for Eric.
 Since we met in seventh grade, I had considered Lane a smart-mouthed little pest while he thought of me as a big, dumb oaf.
 In Eric's company, we each learned better.
 I have Eric's treasures, which Sylvia gave me.
 Along with them came a treasure of hers, a letter from Pam Greenman.

Chapter Sixteen Lessons
 The dreams I had then were the most dreadful I‚Äôd ever had.
 I jolted awake and shuddered for several minutes at the images I could not beat down.
 Ruby was there, waiting for me.
 ‚ÄúWhere are the others?‚Äù I asked, voice hoarse.
 ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve set up a perimeter.‚Äù It was all I had to say for the moment.
 I felt empty, alone.
 It was dark; even with the dust I‚Äôd not slept through the night.
 I sat up, curling my legs against my chest, and wrapped my arms around them, pulling tightly in.
 Though I didn‚Äôt speak, I occasionally glanced, or glared, at Ruby.

He nearly leaped off the bed and looked for a sword but of course there was none.
 He stepped in front of the bedroom door as he quickly did his best to close the broken study door.
 He quietly unlocked it and stepped back and said simply, ‚ÄúEnter,‚Äù and waited for the Adapt to come inside.
 Korin came into the room with a relaxed step that showed him to be much more comfortable than Rodregas was.
 Korin was a good looking man.
 It was always weird with him.
 He changed bodies so often that you always felt like you were meeting someone new, but it was not long before you realized that it was Korin.
 He wore a slim male body that was well-built, not much over 20 years old, with blue eyes and blond hair.
 Rodregas was not sure what to say to him so he stood there simply looking.
 He was the Master and it would not be surprising for Ravenhurr to keep him waiting for a few minutes.

The sudden surge of tingly, pleasant energy nearly distracted me from the fact he was very carefully not meeting my eyes.
 "Can you feel that?
 I mean, it feels good, doesn't it?"
 I felt smiles tug at the corner of my lips as a giggle bubbled in my chest.
 "I think it's supposed to feel good, silly."
 My laughter died at his lack of matching mirth.
 "Have you ever wondered about my mom?
 I mean, why she's the way she is?"
 Definitely not a time for funniness apparently.
 "What do you mean?

She was looking around at the other students.
 "Nothing, come on.
 We're going to be late for class."
 I followed without a word, even more intrigued now.
 'Cool' people don't sweat tardiness and Britney really wanted to be cool.
 A slender, frumpy-looking woman looked up from her desk as Britney and I walked in.
 I held up my form, which she took without reading it.
 "No doubt something to ensure I know you're my newest student.
 Sit over there where you won't distract Britney from just how poorly she's doing in my class.

Be wary.
 I will not take sides in this conflict, and neither shall the Quellan elves, but if I find who caused this war, I will kill him.

 A great beat of white wings and then the elf was in the air.
 Antonil watched him fly far south, watched until he was a tiny white dot among a blanket of stars.
 Before he stopped watching, however, he saw more than fifty similar white dots line the horizon.
 The guard captain smiled, somehow heartened by the sight.
 ‚ÄúLet us hope for miracles,‚Äù he whispered to the night.
 ‚ÄúAnd let us hope that at tomorrow‚Äôs end all my troops are still alive.‚Äù
 He stared at the stars for a long while before joining his troops in slumber.

As punishment, he shoved a hot poker down my throat, ruining my voice into what you hear now.
 One night tribes of hyena-men stormed his tower, wanting vengeance for the many of their kind he had taken to butcher and maim.‚Äù
 Qurrah kept his eyes low, unable to meet Velixar‚Äôs gaze.
 ‚ÄúI was afraid when they came, but as I watched Master slaughter hundreds of them with his golems and his shields of bone I felt at home amid the carnage.
 I knew then what I was to become.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúHow did you escape?‚Äù Velixar asked.
 ‚ÄúMaster exhausted himself defending his tower,‚Äù Qurrah said, waving a dismissive hand.
 ‚ÄúHe collapsed at the very top.
 I cast a spell upon his throat, filling it with ice.
 I watched him die and then I left that disgusting place forever.‚Äù

I don't want to make the hike again, so I'll probably spend all of Sunday shooting, and then hike back on Monday."
 Mom paused in her preparations to put her hand on my forehead.
 "You're not coming down with anything, are you?
 You've been so listless lately.
 Do you need me to stay home with you?"
 There it was, the perfect opportunity to get her to stay home with me.
 It would get me out of having to spend time with Brandon's increasingly annoying friends, which was what I currently wanted more than almost anything else in the world.
 Unfortunately I wanted to spend time with Brandon even more than I wanted to avoid his friends, so there wasn't really a choice.

Some were very emotional and some were humorous, all were heartfelt and meaningful descriptions of their individual challenges to reach that next level.
 It was clear that everyone here, whether they were staff or student, had the ability to impact anyone they touched.
 When the moment arrived for this evening‚Äôs three graduates to speak, a young lady in her early twenties walked to the front of the room with her head down.
 When she looked up, she smiled nervously.
 She had no family present.
 She told everyone how her mother told her how ugly she was her whole life and told her she was worthless, how she attempted to numb the pain with the drugs she took.
 How she became addicted to the drugs, and prostituted herself to pay for her habit.
 She said that she took all the drugs she could because she knew she would never be alive to see her twenty-first birthday.
 She smiled and announced that she was now twenty-one.
 She thanked one staff member after another and one student after another, each for something specific they had contributed to her healing.

I told Audrian that I was not sure you were really Ravenhurr and that the spell did not go as planned.
 By the Infernals, if the spell had gone as planned I would have burned in creation fire and my magic would be inside of your body right now.‚Äù She caught him with those large amazingly green eyes and said, ‚ÄúI had a theory on what happened, but was not sure how to explain it so Audrian would understand.
 He was adamant, and I couldn‚Äôt argue with his logic, as he had said to you last night, you must be either Gerald or Ravenhurr.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut you aren‚Äôt,‚Äù she continued, ‚ÄúAnd well, you actually seem pretty nice, and you can handle yourself in a fight.
 I was just joking about the bow.
 You have been really generous.
 I was just talking.
 You two can both wrestle a bear barehanded and probably win.
 Hell, Audrian stabbed you with a knife last night and while you are bleeding a bit, you are getting around pretty well considering you had a knife in you last night.
 Now you are showing us trust by giving us weapons.
 I am sorry,‚Äù she finished.

Karak is death, Ashhur is life, and Celestia everything else, if the ramblings of priests and elves is to be believed.‚Äù
 Velixar nodded, the fire in his eyes growing.
 ‚ÄúThis world is young, Qurrah, and Karak and Ashhur are young gods.
 Only five-hundred years ago they came and gave life to man.‚Äù Those eyes twinkled.
 ‚ÄúI was one of the first they made.‚Äù
 The half-orc pulled his ragged robe tighter about him as he stared into the fire.
 ‚ÄúHow is that possible?‚Äù he asked.
 A soft wind blew, making the fire dance, and in the flickering flames Velixar smiled.
 ‚ÄúI was the favorite of Karak, my dear orcish friend.
 He gave me life when other men would have long turned to dust.

He smiled down at her.
 "We'll get something to eat in San Diego.
 I'm sure they have some authentic Mexican restaurants."
 They had two days left, and Marie chose to spend Thursday wandering around downtown Los Angeles, buying trinkets in the shops and the Farmer's Market on Fairfax and watching glamorous people walk by as she and Rick ate lunch at an outdoor caf√© on Rodeo Drive.
 But her choice for their last day in California was quite a change from that: she wanted to go to Disneyland.
 Mickey Mouse hadn't been around in 1927, and she found the whole idea of a fantasy land for children exciting.
 And she loved Splash Mountain.
 "Are you sad to be leaving?"
 Rick asked that evening as he watched her pack.

He had learned long ago that the better you felt, the harder came the emotional fall.
 He knew this was all too good to last, but knowing that it would not last also made it more important that he enjoy the moment.
 Rodregas was free.
 He was being hunted; but hunted because he had finally dealt out justice.
 He had killed two monsters, two who wore faces not their own, and who he could feel no remorse for killing.
 Rodregas had finally escaped to his quiet place in the mountains to rest and, best of all, with two companions who seemed to be good people.
 Clearly, Doi‚Äôvan had a dark side and he knew little of either of his companions.
 But it had been a long time since he had wanted to know more about anyone that he met.
 Rodregas had a new strong and powerful body, and he owed a great debt of guilt for that.
 He had even been able to free prisoners and give them a second chance at life.

 "Yeah."
 She leaned close, inhaling.
 Then she raised her face to nuzzle his neck.
 "You put on fresh cologne."

I tried to distract myself as we rode east around the lake, attempting to name the species of plants as Junnie might have made me, but there were so many I had never seen that it started to remind me of the difference rather than distract me from it.
 So I bantered with Steed regarding horses and imps and everything I could come up with to keep him talking.
 Chevelle rode quietly behind us, scanning our surroundings.
 I wasn‚Äôt sure if he was enjoying the scenery or playing lookout.
 We rode a few days into the base of the mountains.
 We had stopped to camp when, over dinner, Steed announced he would be leaving us the next morning, heading east.
 His easy humor had become a comfort to me during the long days, our quiet evenings a pattern I knew I would miss.
 The disappointment must have shown on my face.
 He reached a hand up and brushed my hair behind an ear.
 ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, sunshine, I will see you again.‚Äù I smiled a little and he winked at me.

The unfolding and flowering of the human being is at once the source and the goal of development.
 Thus, in all our efforts to elevate human society, our primary endeavour must be to enhance these human endowments and expand individual freedom of self-expression.
 Peace, democracy, employment opportunities, food security, education, training, access to information, cooperation, freedom of action and a spirit of innovation are the essential conditions and means for this process to advance.
 There was a time when humanity‚Äôs progress was primarily the result of the collective efforts of the community, demanding and obtaining the strict obedience and conformity of its individual members to preserve what it had created and further the progress of the collective.
 That point is now past.
 In the century now commencing, the individual human being must come into his own as a free and creative force.
 The groundwork has been prepared by the spread of democracy, human rights, universal education, gender and social equality and, more recently, information empowerment.
 The power of individual awakening is responsible for the revolution of rising expectations that has fuelled unprecedented rates of growth and social transformation during the past half century.
 That same power can be seen among the talented youth of developing countries today, who are awakened to the prospects of a better life and aspiring for higher accomplishment, either at home or in ever increasing numbers abroad.
 The process of upward social mobility that took off in the USA after the Civil War is now occurring in countries around the globe.

But if the call to relationship implies we should adore, I confess that truth has escaped me until now.
 I mean, we all know it's possible to have a relationship with someone we don't adore.
 But to have a relationship with Jesus and fail to adore him seems all wrong.
 Evil, maybe.
 After all, I adored Eric Curtis.
 A Trip
 I drive a lot, across the desert to visit my kids and grandson in Tucson, and all over the West and sometimes farther on vacations and book promotion tours.
 One reason I drive rather than fly is, I come closest to adoring God while on the road.

Chevelle stopped on a ridge to allow us a better view.
 I didn‚Äôt think I would have called it a village‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt count the structures from our vantage point but it must have been ten times the size of home.
 The buildings were the dull stone of the mountain.
 None were trees.
 There was really no vegetation at all, no greens, no browns.
 The entire layout was dark, ashen stones and aged wood that seemed to melt right in to the blue-gray of the mountain.
 The cloudy mist filtered the sun.
 I decided it was beautiful.
 ‚ÄúWhere are we?‚Äù I asked.
 Chevelle nodded toward my hands as he started down the path.

I ran from town and pushed through the brush at the edge of the village, taking the shortest direction out of the boundaries.
 I kept running until I became winded and then hastily searched for some kind of shelter.
 Burrowing deep in a briar patch, struggling to catch my breath, I wrenched the wad of papers from under my shirt, buried them in the soil beside me, and then waited for my punishment to come.
 But no one was coming.
 I was na√Øve to think they would chase me like hounds on a fox.
 They had magic‚Äîthey were High Council.
 I stayed in the patch of briars for most of the day, cowering despite myself, but as the sun lowered in the sky, I crawled out on my belly to start the long walk toward home.
 It was late by the time I reached the tree and I was tired enough I didn‚Äôt care as much about being caught.
 I didn‚Äôt even know if they knew who broke the seal, if they knew I was the guilty party.
 But I was still quiet as I entered the house, then my room, and slid into bed.

As the flag fell it seemed like Geriodon was half way to Rodregas before Doom Hoof started to move.
 Rodregas knew that the only way he would be able to dodge the lance was if his timing was perfect.
 He raised himself up as the lance lowered down and dodged to the right.
 But the lance followed him this time and he felt his body being ripped off the saddle.
 CHAPTER 14 THE ORDER
 Rodregas blinked at the sunlight in his eyes and raised his hand to create some shade.
 Pain shot through his body at the movement.
 He felt his body, now without armor, for any serious wounds.
 ‚ÄúThe good news is that while the tip of the lance did slice into your chest a bit, it is almost healed thanks to what Jordaan did,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan standing above him.
 Rodregas realized he was lying on the ground over by where Doi‚Äôvan had been keeping the lances and equipment.

I could almost feel my pores open up in an effort to keep me from overheating.
 The sensory overload as my eyes tried to adjust to the unfiltered afternoon sun momentarily distracted me.
 It wasn't until I heard the other door swing shut that I realized James had followed us through, but he'd taken the door on the right instead of the one of the left that I'd been holding open for him.
 Wow, talk about a chauvinistic pig.
 It wasn't worth getting bent out of shape.
 I let my door swing shut, and walked over to Rachel's side so that I could see the entire parking lot.
 Empty as it was, it didn't take very long to realize Britney's little white Saturn was gone.
 "I thought you might still be here."
 The voice caught me by surprise.
 I probably would've jumped and screamed a little if I hadn't recognized it.

 His laughter was a roar.
 ‚ÄúNo.
 We do not answer.‚Äù It settled and he added, ‚ÄúThey do not call.‚Äù At that, Steed joined in, chuckling.
 It didn‚Äôt make sense.
 I knew I had been assigned a watcher.
 From the North.
 ‚ÄúNo one?‚Äù I asked.
 ‚ÄúNo.

The shift needed is for planners to study the potentials of the agricultural sector to serve as an engine for job creation and higher incomes, and as a stimulus to industrialization and exports, and then to formulate national goals to maximize exploitation of these potentials.
 Integration of agriculture, marketing and processing
 Conscious efforts can be made to foster the natural linkage between agricultural and industrial development by placing emphasis on crops that have the greatest potential for stimulating the growth of agro-industries, services and exports.
 Filling in the missing links in the chain of processing and distribution, such as pre-cooling for fruit and vegetables, can enable small farmers to produce for national and export markets; it also results in higher at-farm prices and creates alternative forms of rural employment.
 Empowerment of women
 The vast majority of women living in rural areas are engaged in agriculture.
 Therefore, upgrading productivity, skills and incomes in this sector is the single most effective means of improving the livelihood of women in developing countries.
 Skill development programmes in areas such as hybrid seed production, floriculture, inland aquaculture, vegetables and poultry can be particularly beneficial.
 Promotion of micro-level credit institutions and savings programmes can generate capital for the establishment by women of small rural enterprises.

Brandon's people are always skirting around the edge of our territory, but tonight they'll be out in greater numbers than normal.
 If things don't boil over now, it's pretty much guaranteed that there will be some kind of confrontation Monday at school."
 The word confrontation reached out and grabbed me.
 It took a second before I realized it was dragging up memories of the near-fight between Alec and half his pack.
 "What happened last night...it was for real, wasn't it?"
 Rachel didn't ask what I meant; she didn't even bat an eye.
 "I'm afraid so.
 Don't hate the others too much.
 Sometimes when you're that scared it's hard to keep things in perspective.
 Now that they've calmed down a little nobody would really trade you to Brandon on the tiny chance it might smooth things over.

Chevelle, expression uncomfortable, turned to watch out the front window.
 ‚ÄúNeedless to say, it did not go as she had planned.
 At her death, my father was released from her bonds.
 He was horrified at what he had done, at what had been done to him.
 But he hadn‚Äôt the heart to destroy his crop.
 He simply left.‚Äù I felt the tug in my chest at her story, but Ruby‚Äôs eyes were dry and clear.
 I wondered how many times she‚Äôd told it.
 ‚ÄúI hear he wanders the mountain.

 This time it sounded like genuine humor.

No images flickered behind my lids, yet my eyes did not open.
 The muffle in my ears from the drowning dreams was gone.
 I could hear clearly, clearer than I‚Äôd ever heard.
 I hadn‚Äôt found my body yet, but I heard conversations, voices I knew.
 They were whispers but they were clear.
 I listened, hoping to gain clarity‚Ä¶ but something was still wrong.
 Nothing fit.
 They discussed Junnie and Anvil and Fannie, but those all felt like two sets of people now.
 They were worried; I could hear the stress in their tones.
 How long had I been like this?

Mother Teresa's secret had gotten out.
 People in orange vests directed traffic.
 In the parking lot, vendors sold oranges, onions, tapes and CDs in Spanish.
 I didn't see any Mother Teresa dolls, but I was half asleep.
 At 6:30 the church was crowded, standing room only.
 I found a place against the west wall near the front section, where the seats were reserved for MC sisters in their white saris.
 They are mostly small brown women with eyes so bright, at first glance they could pass for children.
 Up front, across from me was a small choir accompanied by a guitar and electric keyboard.
 They sang folk style hymns like ‚ÄúChange my heart oh God, make it ever new, change my heart oh God, make me be like you.‚Äù I leaned against the wall observing the congregation, vaguely aware that my heart sorely needed to change, since that morning my pastime was criticism.
 I grumbled inaudibly at the people who crowded, trying to position themselves for a clear view of Mother Teresa's approach.

Let's take a break for dinner, and then I'll help you."
 He'd forestalled my next excuse as if reading my mind.
 "There isn't anything wrong with letting someone help you.
 Sometimes a helping hand is exactly what's called for."
 The memory had a vividness that'd been lacking lately.
 It was the same aching realism that'd devoured nearly a month of my existence before I finally decided I had to try and go on with my life, for Mom's sake if for no other reason.
 I panicked when I realized just how badly I wanted to slip back into that twilight world where nothing hurt, where it didn't matter if people liked me or not.
 The one where I still had all three of the most important people in my world.
 The fear that I'd give in, that I'd end up in a hospital during the day or two it took Mom to realize I hadn't made it home from school, pulled me back sooner than normal.
 For a second my mind inhabited a body that wouldn't obey any of the normal commands.

Jessica seemed to shrink in on herself, and then she turned and ran away with a final hiss of defiance.
 Isaac looked up at Alec from the corner where he'd been quietly standing.
 Alec's almost imperceptible nod sent him in the same direction as Jessica.
 Whatever meager survival instincts I had left chose that moment to finally kick in, and I felt my knees begin to give way.
 Rachel let out a high-pitched sound that had all of the surprise of a squeal, but none of the excitement.
 Apparently Alec knew how to interpret it.
 He turned back and caught me again before I could hit the ground.
 "There isn't anything to worry about now.
 Go ahead and catch your breath."
 As pleasant as it was to be in his arms again, I was starting to worry he'd get tired of it.

He watched her trace lines in the grass.
 Seeking a way to lighten the mood, he asked her how to spell his name.
 ‚ÄúHarruq?‚Äù she asked.
 ‚ÄúHrm.
 My best guess would be H-a-r-r-u-k.‚Äù
 A soft blow of air from her lips turned the grass to dirt so that a large space lay available for her to write on.
 She wrote ‚ÄòHarruk‚Äô in the dirt with her finger, spacing out each letter.
 Harruq stared at the words representing his name, feeling a tiny thrill.
 ‚ÄúHow about my last name, Tun?‚Äù
 She wrote out T-u-n.

Olga Savitsky was a poet.
 We met at a small church charismatic enough so that nobody minded when she stood in the midst of a service and offered her latest poem.
 Long ago, Olga had discovered that what she needed most was God.
 She would hike and pray her way up Cowles Mountain, a mile and a half of rocky trail, then call her best friend Warren so they could pray together, sometimes for hours.
 Then she might go to work, cleaning somebody‚Äôs home while listening to worship music.
 God, God, God.
 Here is another of her poems, a simple one I‚Äôm choosing because you can also find it on Youtube, read by my Zo√´: Jesus, in the night you are my nightlight.
 Jesus, in the morning you are my daylight.
 Jesus, in the afternoon you are my sunlight.
 Jesus, in the evening you are my starlight.

Not hearing from me and the uncertainty of the night had taken its toll on her and my son.
 I headed home defeated and unsure if I would ever get the opportunity to complete the task that would free my son from a three to five year prison term.
 I was mentally exhausted and I didn‚Äôt know what my next move would be.
 All I knew is that the officers told me that if Ashley contacted me, I was to put her off until next week because they couldn‚Äôt put a crew together until the following Tuesday.
 Not only did I need to put humpty dumpty (the drug deal) back together again, I had to do it on a specific day at a specific time and in a county that the dealers clearly didn‚Äôt want anything to do with.
 It seemed to be an impossible set of circumstances which would need to simultaneously occur to accomplish my task, and oh yeah, I needed to do it without getting shot.
 Chapter 19: A Second Chance A couple of days passed before the crack-berry rang in my car.
 The ring tone surprised me, as it was a sound I wasn‚Äôt accustomed to hearing.
 At first I thought it was a sound on the car radio but quickly realized it must be Ashley.
 She was obviously the only person who had this number and she was very apologetic for the failure to show.

I have been too busy working on my studies.‚Äù Korin now looked at him with a surprised expression and an eyebrow slightly raised.
 Rodregas wondered if he had said something wrong.
 While he had seen the two interact for some years, he really did not know what was appropriate for him to say in such a circumstance.
 Rodregas knew that he did not have the skills for pretending he was a powerful Immortalist sorcerer, so he said, ‚ÄúHow many people have you killed during the past year Korin?
 And how many others have you raped or tortured?‚Äù he asked, trying to keep a calm voice.
 Now Korin looked very surprised and he started looking around.
 Rodregas saw that Korin noticed the study door, though he was working hard to not show it.
 ‚ÄúHow many?‚Äù Rodregas repeated his question.
 ‚ÄúI am not sure,‚Äù Korin said.
 ‚ÄúFor us to truly become divine we must of course develop our skills.‚Äù As Korin answered the question he took a step back.

I had no choice but to escape.
 I would need a distraction to have any chance.
 I went to the village to find my young Noble.
 I didn‚Äôt expect what was there.
 On my way in, I found the spot where we had met so many days.
 I almost didn‚Äôt recognize it‚Äîbare of growth, the dirt patted down from years of wear.
 And then I saw him, the man in tattered clothes, hunched with his face in his hands.
 He heard me approach and raised his head, the awe all that was recognizable.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre back.‚Äù His voice was trembling, feeble.
 It was my Noble, young no more.

Van‚Äôdret hurried forward and fell to his knees with his head lowered; he did not say a word until after Taiga spoke.
 ‚ÄúPlease, my friend, there is no need for subservience here; let us enjoy a meal together.
 If you don‚Äôt mind, I have a few thoughts I would like to share with you over the food.‚Äù ‚ÄúOf course, my lord,‚Äù said Van‚Äôdret as he stood up he dared to focus on the Guild Dealer for the first time.
 Taiga wore the form of a High Elf male that was slim and graceful, as was most of its kind.
 His hair and eyes were a striking pale violet color, and his skin was a light nut color which made a strong contrast with his hair.
 This was highlighted by the similarly colored silk toga he wore.
 He wore no rings or accessories, his outfit simple, but extravagant.
 Van‚Äôdret suddenly wished he had thought to dress simpler for the occasion his green and emerald outfit with its gold trim seemed garish in comparison; and his human male form that normally seemed attractive and robust seemed ungainly and drab in comparison.
 Taiga‚Äôs manner continued to be friendly but inquisitive.
 The conversation started with a polite discussion on new spells that Van‚Äôdret was working on, and then moved to his thoughts on the recent political and economic tensions with the Romig Empire.

A knight stood in the middle of the square and would declare the winner of the match.
 Rodregas‚Äô first opponent looked like a grizzled army veteran; he had a red ribbon and a blue ribbon so he was a man of some skill.
 Rodregas knew he had to do well today or he had no chance.
 He stepped into the square.
 The sands of the ground shifted slightly under his weight as he circled his opponent.
 The veteran was clearly taking him seriously, going in slowly with his knees bent and his feet keeping active.
 Rodregas would have no skill advantage here.
 Rodregas was hesitant to bash his sword too much, as it was of average quality.
 While the sword should be fine for his first match, he hoped to be fighting all day today.
 He went forward leading with his round shield.

Full quivers hung from their backs.
 Sixty more elves joined their lone companion on the street and readied their bows.
 The men in the center raised their shields, but they knew the deadly aim of a trained elf.
 They were about to be massacred.
 ‚ÄúStand firm!‚Äù Antonil ordered, raising his own shield.
 ‚ÄúStand firm.
 Do not break formation!‚Äù A shout came from the elven side, and then the hail began.
 More than a hundred arrows rained down on the army, each deathly precise in its aim.
 Not one hit flesh.
 Antonil lowered his shield.

My head turned with the contact, whipping back toward her before I had a chance to rein in the shock and anger.
 Fannie‚Äôs eyes lit with anticipation.
 Like she wanted me to fight back.
 I had never even talked back to Fannie.
 I didn‚Äôt have the size to fight her, let alone the magic.
 And she was conniving.
 When I‚Äôd first come to live with her she had sent me to Council repeatedly, complaining of my behavior.
 I had undergone hours of ‚Äúevaluations‚Äù under the scrutiny of Council members.
 Exams and trials and endless questions.

I don‚Äôt remember falling.
 Probably the water revived me.
 As Eric helped me out, I got more cheers than he had.
 Later he would explain I had made a neat flip while careening into the pool.
 He led me inside, wetted a washcloth and dabbed the wound on my forehead until I faded.
 I awoke on the outskirts of heaven, gazing across a chasm at the enchanted forest.
 The air resonated with music, clean and simple melodies, at once ardent, tender and joyful.
 Maybe it was a dream.
 Or a premonition.
 Or, for all I know, I might have briefly died.

The rest of the class period should have been enjoyable.
 My group had the right answer, which I'd come up with on my own, and we were now learning about leverage, mechanical advantage, and friction, all of which were actually pretty interesting.
 I studiously ignored Alec, even though I could all but feel him glaring at me the entire time.
 When the bell finally rang, Mrs. Alexander looked up from her white board with a startled expression.
 "I suppose that's it then.
 Don't forget to turn in your assignments on your way out."
 Anxious to make sure I got credit for all the work I'd done, I hurried up to the front of the class before Alec could get to his feet.
 "Oh, Adriana.
 It looks like you've been busy."
 She took my handwritten report, and then held out a hand as Alec approached.

It had been a hard day.
 I'd....actually I wasn't sure why it'd been a hard day, but something told me I'd unconsciously been at the end of my rope just before I'd collapsed.
 Unfortunately that same thing told me I couldn't dwell here in the comforting absence, there was a very important reason for me to regain my feet.
 The void was reluctant to let me go, stripping me of memories and experiences as I fought my way free.
 By the time I was near surfacing I no longer remembered just how much I'd wanted to stay.
 Britney was pacing back and forth when I opened my eyes.
 She had her cell phone out and was looking like she wanted to dial 911, but was worried about the possible fallout.
 I was on the ground, which for some reason made me more irritable than it should have.
 Didn't she realize how hard it was to make it over to someone before collapsing like that?
 It kind of defeated the whole point if they then put you on the ground where your clothes would take their normal, instantaneous-collapse beating.

 "In a little while.

 He grilled steaks outside and made some steak fries.
 "Mmm--this is delicious," Marie told him, closing her eyes with pleasure.

 "Thank you."
 "If I keep eating like this, I'll get fat."
 "I doubt it."
 He reached for another slice of French bread.

This must have been shit, what?
 1962?
 Earlier?
 I can‚Äôt do a timeline, man, not even of my own life‚Äîsome of it is such a blur.
 Is it like that for everyone?
 I have a memory of our family kitchen before school, oatmeal warming in a pan on the stove, my father dunking his folded toast into his coffee, and the plastic radio tuned to some ‚Äúhits‚Äù station, probably WHBQ.
 This was the same radio from which I would later hear about deaths: Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Martin Luther King.
 Shit, I still have that little radio‚ÄîI kept it because it seemed important.
 (laughs) It was my mother‚Äôs kitchen radio‚Äîit‚Äôs still around here somewhere.
 And, on this particular morning of oatmeal and familial familiarities, a song emanated from that plastic box, bellowing something about a ‚Äúblack branch with blood that kept dripping.‚Äù You know?

I had a pair of heartbeats to wonder at the strange tricks my subconscious was playing on me, and then the dream started fading away.
 The heavenly surroundings were predictably the first thing to disappear, leaving afterimages of light burned into the corners of my vision.
 Alec was the next thing to go, but the memory of his features clung to my mind long after I found myself in a featureless void.
 Stranger still, his scent stayed with me even longer.
 I was just self-aware enough to hope I'd remember it all when I awoke in the morning.
 Chapter 5 It was a good thing I'd started school in the middle of the week.
 If I'd gone to school the next day after all the drama of learning about our mortgage problems I probably would have had a nervous breakdown.
 As it was, I was essentially worthless all weekend.
 I tried to warn Mom about the animals that'd mauled the kids from school, but she told me she was already aware of the incident and left before I could draw her into a discussion of what we should do about the bank.
 I saw her for maybe a total of three hours during the entire two days.

Chapter 26 It was amazing how quickly my classes flew by when I had a friend, or at least a protector, with me at all times.
 Then again all of Monday had flown by, not just the school portion of the day, so it really shouldn't have been a surprise today was doing likewise.
 After Spanish, Jasmin had escorted me to Mrs. Campbell's class.
 Telling her I wasn't going to be able to help out at the lab anymore had been one of the harder things I'd ever done, but she'd been surprisingly understanding.
 We'd scheduled my makeup test for the next day and I'd left with the sneaking suspicion she'd guessed more about what was really going on in Sanctuary than either pack would've liked.
 I'd been busy contemplating what Mrs. Campbell might have really figured out as we left the building, only to have Jasmin interrupt my musings with an apology of all things.
 She didn't get into specifics, and it was obvious she was still worried about the coming showdown with Brandon, but I was pretty sure she really was sorry.
 It didn't make us best friends and she was still an enigma, but it was a start.
 It even gave me hope maybe Jessica and James might eventually come around.
 I was still reeling in surprise as we walked out to the parking lot and met up with the rest of the pack, or rather the rest of the pack minus Alec.

That last topic becomes the lead-in to her story.
 No sooner has she begun the telling, than Curly wanders off.
 Later I'll notice her on a couch close by, reading a book, or maybe pretending while she keeps watch over her friend, who no doubt is considered wacky by many, for reasons her story will clarify.
 A few years ago, she began to feel that something evil was inside her.
 ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt demonic,‚Äù she assures me.
 And it isn‚Äôt any part of her basic nature, she believes.
 Over some months, through prayer and meditation, she came to believe that evil itself had invaded the world and entered people, and God had allowed this to happen, which led her to a certainty that we are now living in the world‚Äôs final days.
 Powered by these revelations, she prayed with intensity and perseverance.
 And God responded by urging her to give herself entirely to him.
 She assured him she was all his.

‚ÄúThe elders are in an uproar.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt question any further.
 Town trouble was usually of no interest to me.
 Actually, I couldn‚Äôt think of the last time the town had had trouble‚Ä¶ She huffed and I knew it was best to indulge her.
 ‚ÄúWhat sort of trouble?‚Äù ‚ÄúApparently, Evelyn of Rothegarr came into town from the meadows at full speed wheezing and sneezing.
 She reached the village center, grabbed her throat, and fell to the ground without a breath.
 Dying.‚Äù I stopped chewing, my mouth gone dry.
 Fannie continued, ‚ÄúThey found a common thistle caught in her airway.‚Äù My stomach curled into knots.
 I whispered, ‚ÄúA thistle?‚Äù ‚ÄúMmm.
 Council thinks she must have been working a spell that went awry.‚Äù Fannie peered at me; I might have turned pale.
 She threw the cork at me.

I wondered what Igneeria would be like.
 Maybe the place would be pretty decent‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúJazell?‚Äù Emily‚Äôs voice scattered my thoughts and I opened my eyes to see her walking briskly towards me.
 She too had an empty bag slung over her shoulder.
 She dropped her bag next to mine and leaned against the statue.
 Nobody spoke for awhile.
 Finally Emily opened her mouth and said, ‚ÄúWhat are you thinking about?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù The question had caught me by complete surprise.
 ‚ÄúWhat are you thinking about?‚Äù she repeated.
 ‚ÄúSurely you must be thinking something; we‚Äôre going to some ‚Äòother world‚Äô!‚Äù I closed my eyes.
 ‚ÄúI was just wondering what it would be like in Igneeria.
 What about you?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said thoughtfully, ‚ÄúI was thinking about Kojas-‚Äù ‚ÄúEmily don‚Äôt say his name, I don‚Äôt feel like being yelled at again.‚Äù I interrupted her.

 She was quiet until they were flying through the clouds.
 "They don't look like cotton.

 "He has instruments to help him.

 She did, marveling at the beauty of perfectly clear blue skies above and white powder puffs below.
 The clouds looked so soft and fluffy that she wished she could bounce on them.
 The trip was exciting.

The average cost per additional job is less than $1,000, roughly one-tenth the average cost of jobs in India's private sector and one-hundredth the cost of new jobs in the public sector.
 Implementation of the strategy will require a substantial investment in training of both on-farm and industrial workers, but the plan is based on the recognition that enhancing the skills of the nation's rural work-force will take time and must be done incrementally.
 As the programme gains momentum and rural incomes rise, the demand for industrial products and services will grow, resulting in a shift to greater farm mechanization and gradual movement of more and more workers to non-farm employment.
 Organization is a crucial issue in a country of more than 90 million small farmers.
 The strategy envisions the establishment of several new types of organization to bring together small farmers for processing, marketing and distribution and to promote more active linkages between farmers and the private industrial sector, both Indian and foreign.
 In order to implement such a massive strategy within a ten-year period, government must play a central role as catalyst and pioneer, rather than owner or manager, to generate widespread public awareness about the technological and commercial opportunities, identify optimal and sustainable resource-based potentials for specific regions, facilitate the transfer and dissemination of technology, provide training and demonstration, invest in the techno-infrastructure needed for transport, storage and distribution, offer management education to rural enterprises, and promote the establishment of new organizations.
 The Prosperity 2000 strategy has been adopted by the Indian government and incorporated in India's Eighth Five Year Plan.
 A Small Farmer's Agri-Business Consortium, a specialized agency for implementation of the strategy, has been established by the government to coordinate implementation.
 In order to evolve a detailed methodology for implementation and to demonstrate the feasibility of the strategy model, district programmes are being organized in 12 districts around the country.
 A detailed study of Pune District in the State of Maharashtra has documented the potential for creating 750,000 jobs through this strategy.

He was devastated to see the condition of his property but he was strangely calm and understanding.
 He simply wanted our help to get Brandon‚Äôs belongings out of his house and fix things as best we could.
 He gave us an offer we couldn‚Äôt refuse.
 If we would get everything out by the evening and pull out all of the carpet, he would not pursue damages.
 None of us were prepared for what we saw when we turned the key in the lock and opened the door.
 Paper and cardboard blackened the windows.
 When we removed these window covers, we found broken panes behind them.
 The bedroom doors had been kicked in, and broken bongs and stem pipes, empty cigarette packs, matchbooks, just trash littered every surface.
 I don‚Äôt know what the hell these people (my son!)
 did in here, but the carpet could not have been dirtier if they raised farm animals indoors.

"OK."  He bought it for her, looking forward to seeing her in it again tomorrow.
 He noticed that she'd bound her breasts again.
 "Listen, Marie, there are a couple of other things I want you to get."
 "What?"
 "Let's go in here."
 He led her into a large department store and began searching for ladies' lingerie.
 While Marie looked around at all the lacy, sometimes colorful articles, Rick found a saleslady.
 "My friend over there, for reasons I won't go into, may not know her sizes.
 Will you help her find a couple of bras and some underwear?"
 "Of course--I'll take care of her."

I suddenly knew the soaring creature above was a hawk.
 I closed my eyes and relaxed my arm at my side, imagining flying.
 I breathed deep and conjured the image it would see, looking down on us.
 The picture was sharp, even at this distance, but the colors weren‚Äôt as clear, and the outlying shapes not as defined.
 I laughed at myself for adding that detail to my daydream, imagining a bird seeing differently.
 My vision sailed over us, past the ridge, south.
 I imagined seeing the twins, perched in two trees, watching.
 Hardwood bows rested high on their backs.
 The wolves were mostly concealed on the ground, vigilant.
 One glanced up at me, at the bird.

It's the worst possible thing I could do to you.
 If you somehow survive everything that's about to happen, it would leave you forever hungering for another touch, but never able to fulfill that desire."
 I placed a hand on his lips before he could ramp back up to another diatribe.
 "None of that matters.
 All I want is to be with you, and if we're as likely to all die as you seem to think we are, then the state of my mind after you're gone is hardly something worth wasting worry on.
 I accept your invitation.
 As much as I hate the very thought of going to any formal dance, I can think of nothing better than going with you."
 "That's the addiction, the Ja'tell bond talking."
 Now that I knew his concerns, it was hard not to notice just how distracting the feel of his lips under my fingers was.
 Just how pleasant it was to have his hand cupped over mine.

Funny how I'd never realized how expressive they were.
 "Don't lie to me."
 Alec sighed, and then shrugged.
 "I'm not sure what to tell you.
 There's so much you don't know, and most of it I can't tell you.
 More importantly, you're better off not knowing."
 I waited for several seconds, expecting him to go on, and then finally realized the matter was closed as far as he was concerned.
 "Hold on there.
 You can't just leave me in the dark about all of this.
 I'm in up to my neck; you have to at least let me know what I've fallen into."

 And what happens after those signals appear.

I looked up from his outfit just in time to see a flash of concern melt away into relief.
 I had just a moment to wonder at the novelty of Isaac showing that much emotion all at one time, and then James stalked through the door in a tux that was so cutting edge, that I wasn't sure if there was anything else like it anywhere in the States.
 The shimmery nature of the fabric combined with an unusually angular, sharp cut to make it different than anything else I'd ever seen.
 I worked my way up from the blindingly-polished black shoes, to the splash of deep red peeking out of his chest pocket, and somewhere along the way decided I loved the tux.
 As amazing as James' and Isaac's tuxes were, I was already looking past them, craning my neck to see down the hall in a vain effort to catch a glimpse of Alec.
 There was no reason for my heart to be pounding away so furiously in my chest, but unlikely or not, my body at least seemed convinced he was going to change his mind and leave me standing here by myself.
 Rachel looked up from her conversation with Jasmin just long enough to give me a reassuring smile, and then I heard the barest whisper of sound.
 I spun around with a speed that gave lie to all of my pathetic attempts to pretend like I hadn't been worried.
 Alec was standing in the doorway, having crossed the distance down the hall faster than I would've believed possible, appearing almost as if by sorcery.
 His shoes were every bit as shiny as James', leading up to slacks that could've been mistaken for shiny, but were actually something else, something with more depth than anything I'd seen before.

In Jammin‚Äô Jim‚Äôs Neighborhood
 Bob Williams enjoys creating nicknames.
 An alias he gave himself is Jammin‚ÄôJim.
 How it fits, I haven‚Äôt a clue.
 He calls my little girl Zo√´ Dot Dot.
 By the time I reach Portland, I‚Äôm thinking more about my Zo√´ than about Brother Lawrence.
 Bob and his smart, pretty wife Barbara have a swell house and garden.
 They moved to Portland long ago when Bob found work there teaching industrial arts.
 On the side, he builds canoes and remodels everything within reach.
 Barbara has lately returned from Hong Kong, where she spends about half her life running some division of a company that makes digital displays.

His eyes were half covered by his hair and his eyes locked onto mine.
 He rolled his eyes and looked away.
 Jason had his arms over his head, trying to keep the rain off his red hair but I already saw dark spots all over it where the rain had escaped his arms.
 Emily's pink hair was dry and safely under a hood.

 ‚ÄúEmily, how come you have a hood?‚Äù I had to shout over the rain.
 She gave me a dazzling smile.

They had to be careful, for if any saw the two half-orcs traveling amid the dark their lives would be forfeit.
 When they neared Celed, Qurrah halted.
 He stared down a particular street for a long while before closing his eyes.
 Harruq waited in silence.
 ‚ÄúThat is the way,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúIt will be the only gated home.‚Äù

Were you dreaming?‚Äù I asked.
 He shook his head.
 ‚ÄúJust a bunch of nonsense I don't even remember.

 Only this time, I talked to the ghost girl.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou did?
 What did she say?‚Äù ‚ÄúShe hinted that she knew who made us this way and who attacked us that day,‚Äù I said.
 ‚ÄúShe also said that Kojas would use our emotions against us and try to get us to come to him.‚Äù Something dark crossed Seth's face.
 ‚ÄúShe also said that we were chosen because of our strong bond, but she said, not to test it,‚Äù I continued.

Velixar turned his attention to Qurrah.
 ‚ÄúGive me your hand,‚Äù he said, and the thin half-orc obeyed.
 Velixar closed his eyes and whispered a few brief words.
 Qurrah‚Äôs head jerked suddenly, and his eyes flared open.
 Velixar released his hand as the half-orc murmured.
 ‚ÄúI know where he is,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúIt is all I can see.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúGo now,‚Äù Velixar said.
 ‚ÄúThe night is young.

"He's on that lawyer show we watch!"
 She stared, and Rick smiled at her awe.
 She didn't turn back around until the actor was gone.
 Looking at Rick with wide eyes, she said, "You told me we probably wouldn't see any movie stars."
 "We were lucky."
 "Maybe we'll be lucky again!"
 And they were--that very night.
 They went dancing, and in the middle of the floor was a young actor from one of the newer shows.
 He was the center of attention, making all sorts of wacky dance moves.
 Occasionally he'd draw one of the girls from the crowd surrounding him and dance with her for a minute or two.

Alec paused for several seconds, which wasn't promising.
 Then again, he hadn't released my shoulders yet, so maybe there was still some hope.
 "I'm not sure that's the best idea.
 You really need your sleep.
 The whole purpose of this little exercise is to convince your mom you've been safely home this entire time.
 If you crash later in the day, she's going to know you didn't sleep tonight."
 "Maybe if you stayed with me it would help me sleep."
 I almost couldn't believe those words were really coming out of my mouth.
 I wanted to blame it on how close he was standing, or how tired I was, or anything else that might be remotely believable, but based on how serious his face had just become, it was too late to take it all back.
 "That doesn't strike me as being a much better solution."

The motion was so casual I was pretty sure nobody even realized he'd pinned my arms to my stomach with surprising strength.
 I thought about kicking, or even screaming, but that would just leave me feeling like a child and give Alec exactly the kind of attention he was probably hoping for.
 "You hit your head pretty hard; I really think we should get you to the office.
 Sir, with your permission?"
 The comment about hitting my head settled me down.
 It wasn't until we were out in the hall that I realized my head didn't hurt.
 That was probably a really bad sign.
 "Let go of my hands."
 Alec unpinned my arms, set me down, and then chuckled as I started gingerly probing my scalp.
 "What are you doing?

I landed hard against my back.
 I slid down, barely standing on my feet.
 Someone was in front of me.
 Ruby.
 I threw my hands back to steady myself.
 It felt like a wall of stones behind me.
 I didn‚Äôt look back, though, because just as I‚Äôd regained my footing, I heard the howls.
 Before the next breath, a new sound‚Äîa closer sound‚Äîfilled my ears.
 Shoosh, shoosh, shoosh.
 It took longer than it should have to realize they were arrows.

For a split second he saw the ground coming up to hit him in the face.
 And then... darkness.
 CHAPTER 10 THE OTHER KIND OF PAIN
 Rodregas laid there looking at blue swirls for a long time, wondering where he was.
 He was not sure if he was awake; his mind seemed heavy with dreams, and shifting images.
 It took him a long time before he remembered the battle.
 With the memory came concern for Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda, and a surge of adrenaline that gave him the energy to try to wake up.
 Rodregas tried to sit up, but his body, which had been so strong since that day at Raven Keep, now only responded sluggishly.
 He was sleepy, but had the idea that he had been sleeping a very long time.
 Yet, his body still felt exhausted.

‚ÄúCome on, we have to pack.‚Äù She dragged me along as she rushed back to her house.
 She threw things around her room, sorting and gathering.
 I didn‚Äôt really have anything to assemble.
 There was only the pack I‚Äôd acquired months ago, nothing in it but that stupid white dress and the pouch‚Ä¶ The pouch.
 I hurried from the room, explaining to Ruby I would be getting ready for the trip.
 ‚ÄúI already put your pack in the front room for Chevelle.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just check it,‚Äù I said.
 ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù I found the pack with some of Chevelle‚Äôs things.
 As I started to open it, I knocked one of his bags over and went to pick it up.
 The flap was loose and a piece of familiar fabric hung out.
 I glanced over my shoulder to be sure Ruby wasn‚Äôt watching, and opened the bag to find the fabric-wrapped package she‚Äôd handed to Chevelle our first day here.

Alec caught me before I hit the ground.
 "Are you ok?"
 "I think so.
 I thought I was past all of this recovery stuff."
 He looked concerned but I'd learned to read his expressions better than I think he realized.
 He was worried, but not just about me.
 He spent a lot of time worrying.
 The rest of the pack, the town, his mother, his sister.
 It was a lot for someone our age to deal with.
 "There's an uncommon amount of that going around right now."

As the magic smoothed out Rodregas smiled and said, ‚ÄúThe ley line would be as much of a problem as a help unless, of course, the farmhouse is made of Nymph stone.‚Äù Rodregas expected the sound of pleased surprise but instead heard alarmed in-drawn breaths from them both; he saw that they were looking to the right, where he suddenly noticed movement.
 Two female Dire Cats stepped out of the orchard and made their way to the farmhouse.
 They had a relaxed, bored look.
 He thought that they gave him a casual nod, but he could not actually see any movement.
 Rodregas simply knew that these were the two Dire Cats that he had freed from the Dungeon.
 ‚ÄúDid everyone from that dungeon follow me?‚Äù he whispered to himself.
 The three stood there fighting to keep the horses from running and watched as the Dire Cats stepped through the main door for a moment, but left after only a short wait.
 The Dire Cats then circled the main building and went over to the far edge of the main house and then simply disappeared.
 Rodregas said, ‚ÄúI think they just went into the cellar of the home.
 The entrance is over there.

‚ÄúWill we strike the elves?‚Äù Qurrah asked.
 ‚ÄúWhy do you ask?‚Äù
 The half-orc laughed.
 ‚ÄúMother was an orc who had lived here in Woodhaven.
 I do not know her name, other than what she instructed my brother and I to call her: Mama Tun.
 Our father was from Woodhaven, she told us.
 We later found out he was an elf, bizarre as it seems.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúIt is a wretched elf who would mate with an orc,‚Äù Velixar said.
 ‚ÄúNo true elf would,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúThis means he was weak to have done so.

So she was 22 in this picture.
 Hmmm .

 he would have thought that most 22 year olds in the 1920s would be married.
 Especially a girl as beautiful as this one.
 But Tranton was her family name, so she apparently wasn‚Äôt.
 Scanning the text on the page opposite the picture, he found a little information about her.
 She‚Äôd gotten married at 23‚Äîa year after the picture had been taken.
 And she‚Äôd died in 1941.

 Miles away, Harruq awoke screaming.
 Aurelia rushed to his side as he curled into a ball, shuddering frantically.
 ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead,‚Äù he said.
 Cold sweat covered his body.
 Remnants of his nightmare floated before his eyes, the icy voice of Velixar rolling over him in his vengeful fury.
 All he‚Äôd known, all he‚Äôd ever loved, was dead and gone.
 Only Karak had remained, furious at the loss.
 Through it all, one single fact pulsed as an undeniable truth.

Council does not attempt to rule the North.‚Äù I considered that, considered my watcher.
 He was a volunteer.
 I seethed for a moment, but flashes of my mother and council cloaks flooded my thoughts and I had to block them.
 ‚ÄúSo the North‚Ä¶ has no council at all?‚Äù His answer was uncomfortable.
 ‚ÄúNo.
 No council.‚Äù He paused while he formed the rest of his reply.
 Steed watched him, intent.
 ‚ÄúWe are‚Ä¶ unruled.‚Äù ‚ÄúUnruly,‚Äù Steed added with a laugh.
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve never had a council?‚Äù Grey shook his head.
 ‚ÄúNo rulers?‚Äù He gave Steed a sidelong glance.

 Marie smiled.
 She hadn't even thought about binding her chest again, a convention that her mother had never understood or liked.
 She'd always thought she was too well endowed to look good in any of the clothes she liked, but now she couldn't imagine binding it.
 Besides, she liked wearing the lacy bras she'd brought from 2011.
 "Marie," her mother said quietly, taking her daughter's arm as they left the store, "does the young man you met have anything to do with your decision to stop binding your chest?"
 "He just told me that that's not the style in--where he lives.

The most extreme way to increase Oxy‚Äôs effect is to reduce the powder to a liquid, draw it into a syringe, and shoot it into their veins, warming them from the inside out.
 Sound familiar?
 There is nothing more glamorous about this drug than heroin.
 The same addiction, the same diseases, the same low-down disgusting lying homeless in the alley and piss your pants drug‚ÄîOxy is essentially synthetic heroin.
 And the last step, when addicts can no longer afford Oxy, is to get on heroin.
 Lives are ruined or lost completely to this drug, which, unlike the drugs of the past, is found in the medicine cabinets of parents, grandparents and patients with severe pain all over this world.
 Some of these patients lose their prescription unsuspectingly to family members or caregivers who steal it for the street value.
 Other patients have discovered the street value so they beg their medical providers for more, claiming their pain has escalated and they need it more frequently to stop their suffering; then, they sell it.
 The young couple coming to buy my Oxy know me as the latter‚Äîan old guy with a script.
 I know they are both addicts and I know the boyfriend, Steve, is a big time Oxy dealer, selling it faster than he can get it.

 Aurelia eyed him, obviously insulted.
 She gave him two quick raps across the chest.
 ‚ÄúTwo to zero,‚Äù she said before dancing away.
 Harruq raised his swords and roared.
 He crossed the distance between them in a heartbeat, twice as fast as he had ever moved in their previous sparring matches.

 His breath caught on a sob of pain.
 He sat up, digging the heels of his hands into his eyes.
 He wished he could stop thinking.
 He wished-- All at once he remembered the pages about Marie he'd copied from the book Teri had lent him.
 They'd told about her life, her children--but that had been before she'd come here.
 Then the pages had changed.
 Now that she'd gone back to 1927, would the article have changed again?
 Not back to the way it had originally been, because he knew she wouldn't have married Davis.
 Would she?

 At once, the eight bowed to Qurrah.
 Velixar placed a hand on the half-orc‚Äôs shoulder.
 ‚ÄúIt is your servants that should bow to you,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúAnd one could not ask for a more gifted disciple.‚Äù
 Qurrah stood but kept his head bowed.
 Harruq shifted on his feet, scared and confused.

Tony said, ‚ÄúOh.

 Cliff‚Äôs not much of a talker.
 I believe nobody heard his stories from Vietnam until years afterward.
 I don‚Äôt pry, so I can‚Äôt be sure what goes on inside him, but I have no reason to think he believes in God, or that he doesn‚Äôt.
 But whether he believes or not, Cliff has gotten well blessed since our evening with Billy Graham.
 He has four wonderful kids, and Toni, who is one of those rarest of people who appear to grow brighter, stronger, and more beautiful every year.
 Cliff and Billy's dad, Cliff Senior, invited me to dinner not many years ago.
 The evening became an in vino veritas experience.
 After some cups, he said, ‚ÄúKen, you should know it was me that hounded my son into serving in Vietnam.‚Äù I held back from saying, Yeah, I know.

When she found herself at the edge of it, she veered right, seeing that it extended farther in that direction.
 She deliberately tried to lose herself, since that was how she'd gotten to 2011.
 And she knew that Rick would find her if she didn't get back to 1927.
 It wasn't working.
 She could tell--there wasn't enough fog to hide anything, and she could see that nothing had changed.
 She was still in 2011.
 "Rick!"
 She could hear him hurrying toward her, and she turned to meet him.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart," he said, hugging her close.
 Tears rolled down her cheeks, and she choked back a sob.

For a price, yes.
 Those last songs, dripping with feigned self-pity, seem apocalyptic in retrospect.
 ‚ÄúAllison All Gone‚Äù and ‚ÄúGoodbye to the Shell‚Äù especially appear to comment on Buddy‚Äôs desire to burn his bridges, leave his Memphis past behind, forget his roots.
 And, of course, then there‚Äôs ‚ÄúBurn my Bridges‚Äù and ‚ÄúForget my Roots‚Äù off the second album.
 Even Buddy‚Äôs skillful acoustic playing can‚Äôt save those albums from their own wallowing, from their stooping to the lowest common denominator.
 Of course they sold.
 They were huge.
 Buddy played with Carole King, with the L.A.
 Session, with Linda Rondstadt.
 He was revered, honored (Grammy for ‚ÄúSong for L. Enos,‚Äù 1971), patted on his self-satisfied back.

More and more excited about the prospect of going to my first real party, I bounced down the stairs and into the kitchen for a drink.
 I happened to look out the window as I pulled a glass out of the cupboard, and nearly dropped it when I saw Brandon leaning against his car, patiently waiting for me.
 Before I could move out of sight, he looked up at me with a self-satisfied smile.
 I nearly dropped the glass again.
 Twenty seconds later I was headed out the door.
 "How did you do that?
 There was no way you could possibly have timed things that close."
 Another smirk as he held my door open for me.
 "I told you.

He greeted Rodregas with a very bright smile.
 ‚ÄúI see that you are looking much better,‚Äù said the unknown Nymph.
 Imeralda gave the young Nymph a big hug, one that looked far more intimate than Rodregas was comfortable with and she said, ‚ÄúRodregas, we are so lucky that I was able to get Jordaan to come.
 Durien was working so hard trying to heal you, but your body is so hard to work with.
 He says that the same innate magical ability that makes your body so strong also requires a lot of power to heal.
 Normally Durien can heal even a very seriously wounded person, but he could barely keep you and Doi‚Äôvan alive.
 I had to leave and run to Fariste to get Jordaan to come.‚Äù She was smiling like the sun as she spoke.
 ‚ÄúHe was so good to come and just leave at the last moment,‚Äù she added.
 Rodregas thought she was going to start hugging the Nymph again, but she caught herself and came over to him and gave him a careful hug and started fussing with his pillows.
 Rodregas wanted to pull her closer and inhale her scent.

He seemed to be growing up.
 He had never really matured like his younger brother because in his world of drugs he was not living reality.
 Easter was rolling around and we planned on visiting him with the family, but only if he completed certain parts of his program by Easter.
 If so, he would be allowed a LOA (Leave Of Absence) for the day.
 If not, we would have Easter with him at the facility.
 He would have been an inpatient for over two months by then, and the Narconon program would keep him as long as they needed until he was ready to graduate or until he left on his own.
 We could only hope that Brandon stayed with the program and left only when he had the tools to stay off the dope.
 In the meantime, I handled the balance of Brandon‚Äôs court appointments with a power of attorney and I dealt personally with Officer White to have his charges dropped.
 I appeared in court for Brandon in an environment I wouldn‚Äôt wish on my worst enemy.
 Young and old alike were escorted into the courtroom, shackled at the hands and ankles in their jail issued orange jump suits.

I grabbed onto Dom's hand with enough force to bruise a normal person as Isaac and James turned on each other with a sudden ferocity that left me breathless.
 "It's okay.
 They're training, sparring if you will."
 It was hard to believe what I was watching was anything less than an all-out bid to kill each other.
 Isaac ducked a vicious swipe from James, and then knocked the smaller hybrid over with a backhand blow I was pretty sure would've crushed rock.
 Dominic winced a little as the blow landed and her boyfriend hit with earth-shattering force.
 "Are you sure?
 I mean, it looks pretty real to me."
 "They're definitely being careful not to kill each other.
 Isaac could've connected with his claws instead of his fist."

Donovan and I spent two weeks setting up mics in Mom's studio, and then another couple of weeks running sound into every other room of the house.
 She kept insisting it was so she could monitor Mother on the rare occasions when nobody else was home, but I used to hear her trying to play along to 'Courtship'."
 The trace of a smile on Alec's face lulled me into a false sense of security.
 "She doesn't play now though.
 I've been into her room, and there's no violin there."
 "No, she doesn't play anymore.
 She stopped playing shortly after Mom finished up the piece you just heard."
 His expression was so serious now that I almost stopped him before he could continue.
 "She stopped when she realized that 'Welcoming' was the only celebration of childbirth mother was going to write."
 I felt my smile sour, and tried to turn away, but Alec caught my chin and gently pulled my face up, forcing me to meet his gaze.

Everywhere they went men hit on Kim, no one could help it, and Crafty was so insecure, you know?

 He hated going out with her.
 Maybe it led to the divorce, I don‚Äôt know the details.
 But, Kim we loved.
 Back then.
 It was her father, man.
 He was a cunt.
 And he started manipulating Crafty and then us, through Crafty.
 And he would have these fits, like epileptic fits, like anger that couldn‚Äôt be dammed.

Please."
 He didn't look up when she finally complied.
 He'd never known such ecstatic misery.
 He wanted her so much that, 20 minutes after she'd gone, his hands were still trembling.
 Was he a fool?
 She'd begged him to keep kissing her.
 She'd been so caught up in their kisses and caresses that she probably wouldn't have stopped him no matter how he'd touched her.
 He could have made love to her.
 Yet he'd stopped.
 But he couldn't regret that decision.

He closed his eyes and, trying not to touch, lightly ran his hands close to the row of books.
 Quickly he realized that with some books he felt nothing.
 Other books seemed to buzz with energy but gave off no bad feelings.
 Still others had a bad odor of decay or foulness that made him want to cover his nose and pull away.
 In truth there was no smell, but simply a feeling.
 Rodregas made a quick decision to trust this new ability and to take action.
 He had the impression that these foul books were of the most evil soul-stealing magic of the Immortalists.
 He opened up the fireplace and started to chuck all the evil books into the fire with the poker.
 The ones from which magic radiated he placed into the trunk; true books of magic would sell nicely.
 The process of sorting the books and then getting them to burn took several hours and he started to feel how long it had been since his new body had slept.

He was enjoying teaching Kata, both for himself and because they were both eager students and learned quickly.
 CHAPTER 8 THE TEST BEFORE THE TEST
 Over the next few weeks Rodregas, Doi‚Äôvan and Imeralda fell into a regular routine.
 It quickly became clear that while Imeralda might not be a trained mage, she was far more knowledgeable than Doi‚Äôvan or Rodregas in magic.
 So, while Rodregas often led the training in the morning, she led during the afternoon.
 Rodregas thought Doi‚Äôvan was learning far more quickly than any of the squires that he had trained with as a teenager.
 Doi‚Äôvan looked like a daemonic nightmare, and he clearly loved to test his strength in battle, but he was an amazingly quick learner both with the forms and with the books.
 Even though Doi‚Äôvan could not read, Rodregas would read him some of the Grimoires, since they were the only books they had.
 His insights and questions were insightful, and Rodregas realized that Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs intellect was greater than his own.
 Two weeks into the routine the three were starting to get into the rhythm; they had moved into the old house and for not having a roof, it was pretty comfortable.

 And after the second time I chose North Beach over her company, Gloria informed me her former boyfriend had returned on leave from the Marines.
 We shouted at each other long-distance and parted.
 Eric still didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend.
 I had decided he didn‚Äôt want to hurt dozens of girls by choosing another over them.
 Too soon, I would learn about other reasons.
 Girls adored him.
 They phoned at all hours, even risking Sylvia‚Äôs wrath, and they tailed him through the halls of our school.
 But if he had even kissed one of them, he kept it secret.

The fact that she'd found the kiss exciting didn't change the fact that she was an innocent.
 Or that she was far from home.
 Or that she was engaged to another man.
 He had no qualms about wooing her away from her fianc√©, but how could she be anything but confused when she couldn't even talk to the man?
 Heavy-hearted, he finally got to his feet.
 He could no longer hear her sobs, but he knew he needed to give her some time alone.
 He wanted to give her a gift of apology, some flowers or something.
 But there were lots of flowers in the garden.
 He picked up his car keys so that he could go find something nice.
 Marie was huddled in the middle of her bed sobbing.

I am looking for one of two cars I believe they will be driving.
 Will it be the red Dodge Charger or the white Lexus sedan or perhaps a complete surprise?
 One way or the next, they know where I am and what I am driving and exactly where I am parked.
 I have met Ashley, so she should have no problem identifying me.
 I focus on the occupants of car after car.
 I am far too tense to be sleepy, but I am dazed by the constant parade of memories and possibilities that march through my head as I attempt to digest thousands of thoughts‚Äîhell bent on answering the question: Why do I sit here?
 It has been many years since I have been involved in a drug deal, and my assumption is that the process hasn‚Äôt changed much.
 My mother has been through too much pain and I can‚Äôt imagine what affect it would have on her to visit another family member in jail if things go badly tonight.
 I think about the deep secret I have now and what my mother would think, and those defining moments that led me here.

 "Britney, what are you doing?"
 "What?

 I felt a dull ache starting behind my eyes.

 I just hope whatever it was turns out not to be as bad as she thought it was."

 A great beat of white wings and then the elf was in the air.
 Antonil watched him fly far south, watched until he was a tiny white dot among a blanket of stars.
 Before he stopped watching, however, he saw more than fifty similar white dots line the horizon.
 The guard captain smiled, somehow heartened by the sight.

 ‚ÄúAnd let us hope that at tomorrow‚Äôs end all my troops are still alive.‚Äù

At least it earned me another laugh.
 "It wasn't like it was easy or anything, but Donovan gave me some good advice when things were the worst.
 I don't remember his exact words, but essentially it came down to the fact that there'll always be people who're better than me at something.
 Even gaining super powers wouldn't change that.
 What's important is that I do the best I can with what I've been given.
 As crazy as it sounds, Alec's pack needs me."
 I mentally reached around for something similar and then finally nodded.
 "I guess I can understand that.
 My mom would have a hard time functioning without me, so I try to do the best I can at taking care of her."
 Rachel's smile lit the room up.

Still, the thought calmed his own turbulent feelings.
 When her tears were exhausted, Marie rested quietly in Rick's arms.
 If they had been in 1927, everything would be different.
 Rick was so much warmer, so much more thoughtful and loving and fun than Davis.
 She would never have given Davis a second glance if she'd known Rick in 1927.
 At last she sat up.
 "I need to go wash my face."
 "Wait."
 Rick took both her hands in his.
 "I would never do anything to hurt you."

 I shook my head gingerly, surprised when I didn't feel the twinge I knew was coming.
 The attack had been more sudden than usual and nobody had been close enough to catch me.
 In those circumstances experience had shown that I led with my head.
 "It was just the heat here.
 I'm not used to it.
 Now¬†please¬†put me down."
 Alec looked at me doubtfully, then took a deep, no doubt calming breath, and shrugged.

 I turned and went out through the exterior door.
 I was all the way out to the parking lot before I realized that I didn't have a way home.
 I was still trying to figure out what to do, when I heard the deep roar of a high-performance engine.
 Brandon was clear over at the other end of the parking lot, but somehow he saw me and flipped his car around.
 "You're looking just a little stranded."
 "That obvious?"
 His smile was just as radiant and reassuring as always.
 "Only to someone who happens to know your entire schedule, and who just saw what looked like Rachel and James leave without you."
 It was my turn to try and hide a trembling lip as I responded.

They said he was sensationalizing the attack to get his fifteen minutes of fame.
 Daddy tried to get access to the bodies, to provide a second opinion even though that isn't his real area of expertise, but they blocked him cold.
 He thinks they were worried about scaring away the tourists.
 They had to make the accident go away, to save the local economy."
 My hands had gone cold despite the oppressive heat, just now hitting its full stride for the day.
 You didn't hang around the fringe without running into plenty of people who were conspiracy theorists.
 Discussing UFOs, Illuminati, and X-Files had been like air and water for some of the people I'd known back in Minneapolis.
 I'd never given their wild theories a second thought before, but what Britney was describing sounded like a pretty convincing attempt at a cover-up.
 I looked up as I realized Britney had fallen silent, only to realize with a start that a pair of tears were trickling down her face.

His wheelchair-bound friend went anyway.
 The phone rang late that night with the unbelievable news of another car accident.
 This time Tom‚Äôs paralyzed body was thrown through the window and he tumbled down the highway to his death.
 Brandon was inconsolable.
 His best friend was dead.
 Brandon blamed himself for not being there to take care of Tom.
 One of Brandon‚Äôs confessions during rehab was that almost all of his friends decided to get as high as they could to attend Tom‚Äôs funeral.
 It was the beginning of his excessive drug abuse.
 Chapter 24: Let The Healing Begin As Brandon approached his fifth month as a student at Narconon, he called us and told us he was nearing graduation from the program.
 He also told us he had applied for an internship at the facility and that he wanted to become a drug counselor.

 She could go up to someone's house and ask .

"Do you want me to go get you a candy bar?"
 "No.
 I'm going to go take a shower while we wait."
 After her shower she rubbed on some rose-scented lotion.
 Her skin was hot from her day in the sun and just a little red.
 She'd put sunscreen on this morning so that she wouldn't get burned.
 Dropping the bottle onto the bed, she went back to Rick's room calling, "Is the pizza here yet?"
 "Not yet," he replied as he emerged from the bathroom, still toweling his hair dry.
 Marie stared.
 He was wearing only a pair of shorts.

Lamps were lit here and there, casting shadows across the road.
 Harruq stayed far from Celed, the elven side of town, since they sent all their children to be raised in Nellassar, deep in the heart of the Erze forest.
 It was the human children, especially the poor and the destitute, that Harruq sought.
 Of course, none would be out playing, not with so many dead and missing.
 He would need to take different measures.
 Not far from their home, a ratty building operated throughout the night.
 It was Maggie‚Äôs Place, half tavern and half orphanage.
 Maggie enjoyed the free labor and the ability to rant and slap her orphan workers without fear of reprisal while still maintaining the image of a heart of gold to her regulars.

 Harruq stepped into the alley beside the tavern and looked up.

His familiar face.
 He reached out to me and I stepped toward him, tears streaming down my cheeks.
 He wrapped his arms around me as I turned again to see my mother.
 A howl of rage escaped her and I started to go to her, but he held me.
 He was restraining me.
 I thrashed against him as I tried to scream, to tell him to let me go, but I had no voice.
 She reached her hand out and I could not move, could not help her, though I knew she was dying.
 I was imprisoned there, unable to move‚Ä¶ unable to scream‚Ä¶ unable to save her.
 And then I couldn‚Äôt see her.
 Something was covering my eyes.

The pool area was the highlight of the facility, but the staff was warm and friendly.
 I noticed a bus parked out front, slowly loading with students and staff.
 I asked a staffer where they were going, and was surprised when he told me they were headed to a Catholic church for Easter services.
 I told him I thought this was a Scientology-based program, to which he replied that, while this was a common misconception, they did not favor or push any religion.
 A shame, he stated, as this keeps some people away from a very good rehabilitation center where everyone is allowed to practice whatever religion they wish.
 My wife and I had attended Alanon meetings back home and we found them very religious in structure so we expected some Scientology leanings out here in the desert, but found no evidence of any.
 Our son proudly toured us around the grounds and introduced us to everyone we passed.
 He was so enthusiastic and so different.
 Although he was excited to see us, he was calm and collected.
 He was respectful to all and excited to show off his family, he seemed to know everyone.

I'm not sure what brought me out of that black hole.
 I think maybe it was when I looked out the window one day and realized I'd somehow missed fall.
 Fall had always been Dad's favorite time.
 Cindi's had been spring--she hadn't minded the mud.
 My immunity was wearing off; the racing heart was a sure sign.
 I focused back in on what Mom was saying.
 "...you were doing so well.
 Don't worry; this is just a little setback.
 You'll see.
 Being in a different environment will do wonders for us both."

He dozed fitfully, finally coming wide awake just after 6:00.
 He wished he could sleep.
 Sleep would be an escape.
 He couldn't bear the images that had come on the heels of his newest realization--images of Marie surrounded by children, making dinner for them, for a husband, kissing him, making love with him .
 .
 .
 His breath caught on a sob of pain.
 He sat up, digging the heels of his hands into his eyes.
 He wished he could stop thinking.
 He wished-- All at once he remembered the pages about Marie he'd copied from the book Teri had lent him.

People were still trickling into the room, so at least I was spared the full gantlet, but the few gazes I met were still unfriendly until I reached the last table.
 The skinny-ish blond girl already at the table smiled at me as I sat down.
 "Hi, I'm Britney."
 I didn't know what to make of her.
 She looked like the type who was always on the fringe of the popular crowd.
 She was the girl who was the first to follow whatever fad happened to be in, and the first to turn on someone if it would make her just a tad more acceptable to her peers.
 I mumbled a response, something that wasn't rude, but which couldn't be mistaken as pleading for friendship.
 Those kinds of girls loved to laugh at the 'poor, desperate, friendless' types behind our backs.
 "You must be Adri Paige.
 I hope people haven't been too terrible to you."

Unless UN member states invest international institutions with the necessary authority and meet their financial commitments to support them, the world will continue to drift and flounder, powerless to oppose petty dictators and ruthless aggression.
 Unless a cooperative world military force comes into existence, every country will continue to be burdened with the enormous expense and insecurity characteristic of the old system.
 Perhaps more than any other institution, the military has under stood and demonstrated the enormous power of organization to accomplish a goal.
 The Gulf War was a dramatic illustration of the importance of reliable information, perfect planning, logistical support systems, effective chains of command and swift responsiveness to changing situations.
 If humankind could mobilize and apply the same efficiency to the war on poverty and unemployment that it has exhibited in preparing for and waging military wars against each other, very soon there would be no more poverty or unemployment to fight.
 During the Second World War Ford Motors converted from manufacture of cars for the masses to making trucks and airplanes for the military, producing B-24 bombers at the rate of one per hour from a single production plant.
 If conversion from civilian to military production could be carried out by so many countries within one or two years, it must be possible to convert the military from war-based to peace-based applications, and defence industries from military to civilian production, within half a decade.
 That requires human resourcefulness in organizational innovation.
 Organization is the means by which people work together cooperatively to achieve common goals and, in the process, to serve society in a wide range of functions.
 The achievement of food security and full employment depends on the establishment of new types of public and private organizations ‚Äì commercial, financial, industrial, export, research, educational and training.

Emerson, Ayn Rand, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy were all present.
 Whoever lived here was either incredibly well read, or a complete poser who bought books just for show.
 Almost scared to find out which it was, I reached over and pulled out the copy of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and opened it up to find a well-cared-for book that'd still obviously been read several times.
 I carefully slid the book back into its spot and then noticed the faintest glimmer of light coming from an open doorway off to my right.
 It was an art gallery.
 One covered in pictures that were eerily familiar, all with a circular signature at the bottom right hand corner.
 They were mostly of mundane kinds of things, landscapes, or people, but there were overtones that caressed a hidden chord inside my soul.
 Everything was done in drab, painfully boring colors, overlaid with incredibly vibrant, hues that were almost unreal in their perfection.
 It wasn't until I'd moved around a corner and entered what looked like a new phase for the painter that I figured out why the paintings looked so familiar despite the fact that I'd never seen any of the places or people depicted.
 The realization hit with such force that it distracted me from the familiarity of the signature.

Marie was too stunned for a moment to move.
 Finally she walked into her father's embrace, glancing at her mother, who simply smiled at her.
 Apparently she'd prepared her father and brother well.
 They decided to leave for Cape Cod two weeks from Friday.
 Marie thought about the bathing suit Rick had bought her.
 Her father would kill her if he ever saw her in such a thing, she mused with a smile.
 "What are you smiling about?"
 John asked her.
 "Hmmm?
 Oh, nothing.

He reached down and took the purse off his belt.
 Rodregas opened it to find only a few silvers.
 He knew Korin should have more.
 He opened his shirt and, as he suspected, another purse hung from his neck.
 It was of flat leather and inside it were twelve pieces of silver and a small book.
 Rodregas tentatively touched the book and it buzzed slightly of magic.
 It held no foulness so he tossed it into the trunk.
 He added the coin purses to the robe he was wearing.
 He still needed more hard money and some decent clothes.
 Rodregas looked out the window to see a few people leaving the keep grounds, and a few still hanging around the yard.

‚ÄúBe careful now and enjoy yourself!‚Äù ‚ÄúRight I will‚Ä¶‚Äù I said uneasily.
 No doubt that I was going to be very careful indeed.
 I stepped outside and the door closed behind me.
 My mom and dad watched from the window, waving happily to me.
 I returned a slow, uncertain wave and hurried off towards the park.
 As I entered the park, I spotted the rising public art statue.
 The shape twisted and stretched towards the sky, trying to touch it.
 Now that I really thought of it, it did look like a thorn.
 I dropped my bag and leaned my back against the statue, closing my eyes.
 I wondered what Igneeria would be like.

"I wish I had something from 1927 to give you."
 He stroked her hair.
 "You could leave your dress and go back in your bathing suit."
 She smiled.
 "I'll have enough to explain as it is."
 Inspired by the way he was toying with her hair, she asked, "Would you like to have a lock of my hair?"
 "That's a great idea."
 He bent to inhale its fragrance.
 She took scissors from a drawer and reached for a lock on the back of her head.
 She snipped one off and handed it to Rick.

When it struck the wooden gate, it exploded.
 Wood shattered.
 Guards behind the gate howled as molten rock struck them, piercing through their shields and armor.
 The orcs roared at the sight, not at all upset at their own losses.
 The way into the city was clear.
 Axes and swords held high, they rushed the opening.
 ‚ÄúA minor skirmish,‚Äù Qurrah chuckled, echoing the elf‚Äôs words.
 ‚ÄúHow amusingly wrong.‚Äù
 Harruq had anticipated watching the fight over the wall from the roof, but instead they turned and watched the orcs slam into the human forces that surrounded the opening.
 The first push was brutal.

 "Yes.

 It's covered with lace and pearls, and it has a 15-foot train.
 But the important thing is that it was my grandmother's.

The making of Turntable Poison was a liminal time, a time of congruity, or grand passion.
 The melding of the three (sometimes four) musicians was a Synchronicity.
 It can happen more than once but it happened at least once for Black Lung.
 It‚Äôs there on that vinyl circle, waiting for the needle like a junkie.
 And for anyone lucky enough to find that masterpiece in someone‚Äôs garage sale, in some second-hand record shop (where I hear it can go for upwards of a hundred dollars or more), at some friend‚Äôs apartment, there is knowledge passed.
 Because anyone who hears Turntable Poison hears right away what could have been, what should have been.
 What was.
 The album smokes.
 It tears down ceiling tiles.
 It disrupts fish in their blue aquarium lives.

You never even came to class, and you got the right answer.
 Did you cheat?
 Is the answer to this problem out there somewhere on the Internet?"
 Alec's face tightened with something I was willing to bet was anger.
 "No, I didn't cheat.
 I did the research to find the answer, presumably just like you did.
 Next time you feel like insulting me, please suppress the urge."
 I had at least one nasty comeback on the tip of my tongue, but I swallowed it.
 I didn't like his tone, but he did have a right to be mad.
 Luckily, I was saved by Mrs. Alexander's appearance at the door, a dry-erase marker behind one ear, a pencil behind the other.

I let my gaze drop, and found an unearthly pool of liquid light at my feet.
 The quiet murmur of falling water to my right kindled a burning thirst I hadn't realized I'd been feeling since I opened my eyes.
 Looking towards the waterfall, I found a shimmering ribbon of light working its way down the rock face.
 The sight was so incredibly beautiful it took me several moments to realize the tendril was the waterfall I'd been looking for.
 I reached into the dancing pool of light at my feet and smiled as my cupped hands came away filled with water that lit up my palms.
 I couldn't imagine anything more surreal.
 I might have stayed there for hours if the barest whisper of sound hadn't distracted me.
 Alec was staring at me, an expression of disapproval marring otherwise perfect features.
 "Of all the places for you to intrude, why did it have to be here?"
 For a second, surrounded as I was by such beauty, I did feel like an intruder.

The guard captain charged, his shield leading.
 While his upper body was covered, nothing stopped the arrow from flying underneath and piercing through the metal greaves protecting his shins.
 Antonil stumbled, pain flaring up his right leg.
 He forced himself to continue running.
 If he could close the gap, the bow would prove no match for his longsword.
 Another arrow struck an inch from his left foot.
 His leg was aflame, yet he continued to charge, pulling back his shield so his sword could lash out.
 But the elf was not close enough, and he was more skilled with a bow than in just firing arrows.
 He snapped the wood up, cracking Antonil across the bottom of his hand, which held firm to his blade.
 Undaunted, the elf stepped closer, ducked underneath the guard captain‚Äôs return swing, and then kicked at the arrow still lodged in his shin, finally making Antonil drop his blade.

 His heart was troubled and he had not a soul to tell why.
 He held a proclamation of King Vaelor to the entire nation of Neldar.
 He had argued as best he could, but his words meant little.
 When Antonil asked that someone else deliver the proclamation, a frown had crossed the king‚Äôs smooth face and he had slammed his lotioned hand against a table.
 ‚ÄúIt will mean more coming from you!‚Äù the king had shouted.
 ‚ÄúThey will know the seriousness of my order.
 I will not be flooded with spies, treated like a mere peasant, and then insulted by such blatant snubbing of my humble call for aid.

"I think so too.
 Well, almost."
 "Almost?"
 He stopped, turning to face her.
 They were in the dappled shadows of early blossoms, and he drew her into his arms to kiss her gently.
 Marie's heart pounded as she kissed him back.
 His kisses were rare, so she savored each one, clinging to him and hoping that it would go on forever.
 But he ended this one all too soon, raising his head to gaze down into her sparkling eyes.
 "I love you," he whispered, pressing his lips to her forehead.
 Those words were even rarer than his kisses; she'd heard them only twice before.

His glare turned accusing, his mouth suddenly moving with heated, determined words, but my ears only rang louder, engulfing all other sound.
 I cringed, but couldn‚Äôt stop myself from watching the scene play out, even as my head turned down, wanting to look away.
 Why is he fixed on me?
 What are they saying?
 Ruby remained protectively in front of me, her posture lowered, arms tensed tighter since the stranger turned his eyes on me.
 His face twisted in agony as his right arm was dislocated from its socket, leaving the limb hanging limply at the shoulder.
 I was glad I didn‚Äôt hear that sound.
 He turned back to his questioner, his mouth a grimace as the words came out, unmistakably a curse, and his other arm was wrenched from its place as well.
 He winced, apparently not yet numb from the damages, and then his face went hard, his lips pressed together, jaw clenched tight.
 He wasn‚Äôt going to scream.

He knew he wouldn't be able to bear it if he went home and found that she had disappeared.
 After nearly four hours of trying to concentrate on his work, he gave up and told his secretary that he wasn't feeling well and was going home.
 On his way there, a shop window caught his eye, and he slammed on his brakes, causing the driver behind him to lean on his horn.
 He circled around and dashed into the store.
 Marie had just sat down in front of the TV with a dish of ice cream when she heard the garage door open.
 How odd--why would Rick come home in the middle of the day?
 Remembering how he'd seemed to feel ill yesterday, she set her ice cream down and ran to meet him.
 Rick was just getting out of his car.

 Jasmin was the kind of brunette who disproved the old saying that gentlemen prefer blondes.
 Any guy with a pulse would want her.

 I revealed myself and inquired about her previous finds and all the questions that were plaguing me.
 She was furious!

His stomach hurt from his wound, but not as badly as it should.
 Clearly, the first step in his duty was to heal up from his wound and relearn how to fight in his new body.
 When he got up, Imeralda was already standing but Doi‚Äôvan remained kneeling in thought.
 He nodded to Imeralda and she quietly followed him back into the barn.
 About ten minutes later Doi‚Äôvan joined them and they started to plan how to clean up the barn.
 There was also the matter of the house, which was a more natural place for the three of them to shelter, but Rodregas was unsure of the Dire Cats.
 They decided to spend the rest of the morning cleaning up the barn for the horses, and then, after lunch, Rodregas would go and see if he could figure out the intentions of the lionesses.
 With the three of them working, they cleaned up the barn quickly.
 While they were able to move the dirt and debris out, it was still just bare walls and stone floors.
 After a brief meal, Rodregas headed over to the main house.

From Van Morrison to Lorelei.
 That‚Äôs a story, isn‚Äôt it, sweet?
 Um.
 It was at the Shell.
 Black Lung was playing, one of our first headlining gigs, I think.
 I came off stage after the encore, after we‚Äôd done a cooking version of ‚ÄúI Love my Aunt Jemima,‚Äù Skippy going wild like a man possessed, and maybe he was, man, maybe he was.
 This was Memphis, those things are real, man.

In their teenage years, Brandon and Bryce were as different as perfect strangers and they were becoming young men.
 As they began to become more independent from me and from each other, they became interested in different things.
 I tried to accommodate them as individuals and stay close to them.
 I tried my damndest to embrace each son and his hobbies and desires equally.
 Bryce began to love golf, so we played golf often and eventually joined a country club so he could play as often as he liked.
 In the summer, he would spend entire days at the club, soon becoming a great golfer and playing four years on his high school team.
 He also learned what I call ‚Äúaccidental etiquette‚Äù which was my pet phrase for his learning great manners around adults as he golfed with them.
 A kind of ‚Äúwax-on wax-off‚Äù ‚ÄîKarate Kid‚Äîsubliminal learning, similar to how I learned to fight.
 Some of my fondest memories are of the days I got to watch him golf competitively.
 Such a fine young man and a great sport; win or lose, he shows class and dignity.

One Friday evening, she hosted a party.
 I drank several beers, then invited somebody who reminded me of Karen Flagstad to join me for a cruise up the coast road to La Jolla.
 Her name was Kris.
 She would go with me, she said, if not for a babysitting job she had that night.
 After she left, I drank more beer.
 Then I drove to a Jack in the Box on the coast road and found Kris there, in a Ford, hanging onto my cousin Jill‚Äôs boyfriend, Jimmy Dixon.
 Jimmy was one tough fellow.
 According to rumor, while fighting in the Golden Glove tournament, he had knocked another light-heavyweight into a coma.
 An equally tough surfer, Butch Van Artsdalen, rode shotgun.
 I strode to their car, jammed my head through rolled-down shotgun side window and stared at Kris.

If she‚Äôs a good sample of that profession, I would be surprised if most of them could even read.

Partly Dylan‚Äôs doing, but it was inevitable, it was headed that way, the power of it, the communicative power.
 Man, I sound like Rolling Stone.
 What I mean is that rock wouldn‚Äôt have held it‚Äôs place if it hadn‚Äôt shifted, if the words didn‚Äôt start to mean something.
 It was time.
 It was time for music to mean something.
 Dylan, The Beatles, they led the way.
 They said, you know, show us the plan, you don‚Äôt need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.
 And the kids sat up and listened.
 It was coming, this revolution of meaning, this concentration on the word.
 And, all along, behind it like a dark river, ran the beat, the melody, a sort of communication device that was both insidious and right out there in the open.

The slow expansion of world trade and economic growth in developing countries during this period, attributable to prolonged recession in industrialized nations and a drastic decline in demand from Eastern Europe, underlined the need for more effective and better-coordinated development strategies to address the problems of the world's one billion people who live in hunger and absolute poverty.
 Increasing the production and availability of food to meet the nutritional needs of a still rapidly expanding global population led us to propose steps to double food production in deficit regions.
 In many countries, the problem of hunger has less to do with insufficient food production than with distribution or entitlement.
 The poor lack remunerative employment opportunities to generate the purchasing power needed to obtain the minimum essential requirements of food.
 In 1990, the Commission undertook a study of alternative strategies to eradicate poverty among the 300 million extremely poor in India, representing about 25 per cent of the poor worldwide, by more extensive development of commercial agriculture and agro-based industries.
 Following ICPF's third plenary meeting in Madras in October 1991, ICPF's Prosperity 2000 plan for creating 100 million jobs in India was presented to the Indian government, which incorporated the strategy in its Eighth Five Year Plan.
 The findings of that study and the strategic recommendations that emerged from it convinced us that eradicating the spectres of hunger, unemployment and poverty was possible even though these problems are present on such a massive scale in many developing countries.
 Events continued to accelerate with the break-up of the USSR later that year, followed by the collapse of the Eastern European economies in 1992.
 Simultaneously, the slowdown in trade within this region and the high cost of Germany's reunification were having an unexpected and unwelcome impact on economic recovery in the industrial countries.
 Reduced military spending, large budget deficits and declining imports from Eastern Europe slowed growth and aggravated the already acute problem of unemployment in Europe and North America.

 He gaped at her.

 "Don't be ridiculous.

"No, you're right, all too soon you'll go the way of so many others.
 If I can depend on nothing else, I can rely on that."
 A little eddy of wind found its way into our grotto, and for the first time my newly-acute sense of smell registered Alec's presence.
 His scent was divine, full of subtle themes I wasn't experienced enough to pick out, all of which screamed of warm power and rock-like masculinity.
 For half a second the torrent of sensation was too strong to leave room for conscious thought.
 I realized I'd closed my eyes to better savor the experience.
 When I opened them Alec's expression had moved from annoyance to sadness.
 I had a pair of heartbeats to wonder at the strange tricks my subconscious was playing on me, and then the dream started fading away.
 The heavenly surroundings were predictably the first thing to disappear, leaving afterimages of light burned into the corners of my vision.
 Alec was the next thing to go, but the memory of his features clung to my mind long after I found myself in a featureless void.

It was religion to Buddy.
 He sought the perfect note, the one that would bring about rapture.
 One night, after a triple billing at the Shell (Black Lung was the middle act that night, sandwiched between the lesser talents of Rubdown and Barry and the White Panthers), Buddy wandered backstage after his set, still in that trance he seemed to enter when he played, and was greeted by a statuesque blond with eyes the color of the Wolf River at Sunset.
 She stepped into his path like a gunfighter.
 Buddy looked deeply into her.
 She was an equation he could not quite decipher.
 Her eyes stayed on his.
 She was bewitching him and even Buddy, already high from making music, was not immune.
 Today people still talk about Lorelei Enos with a wary reticence.
 ‚ÄúNot much is known about her,‚Äù you hear people say.

Rachel didn't like me anymore, she'd never forgive me.
 I'd managed to alienate everyone from Alec's group, and now Brandon had tossed me aside like so much trash.
 It was too much.
 I collapsed onto all fours, hardly noticing the burning pain from my damaged palms, and let the racking sobs take over.
 I probably would've stayed there all night if not for the howling.
 It'd been going for several seconds before it pulled me back from the mental abyss I'd been so eagerly approaching.
 I looked around blankly for several more heartbeats before I finally managed to place the noise.
 Wolves.
 There weren't supposed to be any wolves in the area, but there wasn't any ignoring my ears.
 I numbly pulled myself back up, and began stumbling back towards the party, only to stop as another howl echoed down through the canyon.

An international research programme should be organized under the ILO to construct a truly global employment model that monitors the impact of technological developments, expanding world trade, plant closings, movement of industry to low-wage countries, agriculture-led industrialization, economic growth, immigration policies, refugee movements and other factors affecting employment opportunities around the world.
 10.Shift focus of technological development: The number of jobs created or destroyed by technology depends on the priority given to various objectives in the process of technological development.
 Presently, there is an in-built bias in technological R & D towards replacing human labour with capital and energy, even when similar levels of quality and efficiency could be achieved by alternative means.
 A conscious shift of focus could lead to the development of more labour-intensive production processes.
 The production of more food to meet the needs of a burgeoning population has been one of the outstanding global achievements of the post-war period.
 It has demonstrated the extraordinary capacity of humankind to meet a collective challenge of monumental proportions.
 It has harnessed the power of science and technology for the most cherished of purposes ‚Äì preserving human lives.
 It has released the initiative and pride of long suppressed peoples to achieve self-sufficiency and determine their own destinies.
 It has finally lifted the suffocating blanket of pessimistic economic determinism that has stifled human hopes and aspirations for nearly 200 years since Thomas Malthus first set forth the thesis that human population will always outrun the growth of food production, thus ensuring the perpetual poverty of humankind.
 The remarkable achievements of countries such as India, which at a time when famine threatened to claim millions of lives launched a massive national programme that increased foodgrain production by three-quarters, and China, which nearly doubled food grain production over the last two decades, are outstanding testaments to the accomplishments of people in many countries.

Rodregas tried to reach out to push Ravenhurr into the circle, but before his hand touched the sorcerer, Ravenhurr lost his balance and fell into the circle.
 The moment that Ravenhurr crossed into the circle he started to burn.
 His body twisted in pain as he burned the same blue fire of creation that he had called forth to rip apart a man‚Äôs soul and steal the physical essence of a Celestial Lion.
 The flames that he had called forth to steal the AElfin maiden‚Äôs magical abilities now burned him.
 The timing had been near impossible.
 The spell calling forth the flames of creation could only burn one life.
 But the timing was perfect; Ravenhurr called forth the fire, and then he was in it.
 The flames consumed his body in seconds, and flaring from the circle went the multi-colored energy of his magic, the one element that the circle was designed to protect from the flames.
 His magic power shot out of the circle and started orbiting the larger circle.
 He was completely gone.

A fire lit beside us as if of its own accord.
 He strode off in search of food, and I sat close, tucking my cheeks into the material of the cloak for warmth.
 A moment later, he was back, our breakfast roasting over the flames.
 We ate in silence and mounted the horses as we had each day before, but it was obvious nothing was the same.
 How could it ever be?
 I was racked with guilt as we made our way up the mountain.
 I purposefully rode behind him, glad at least to be able to control the horse on my own.
 Small patches of snow had started to dot the landscape, the vegetation a darker, sharper green.
 Occasionally the sun would break through the mist, making me squint, and I would appreciate the calmer, hazier atmosphere.
 Gloom, as they called it at home, in the usually sunny village where I would spend my eternity.

As India‚Äôs Freedom Movement worked to awaken the population to the possibility of independence from foreign rule and its Green Revolution worked to awaken farmers to the possibilities of higher productivity, the future lies in awakening each individual in society to his or her own greater human potential.
 Chapter Seven of the Commission‚Äôs report examines some of the principal means at our disposal to enhance and accelerate the development of these human capacities.
 It called for efforts to re-examine our development experience over the past few hundred years in order to arrive at a deeper and clearer understanding of the process and principles that govern human evolution, individually and collectively.
 Since the publication of the report in 1994, ICPF‚Äôs successor organization, the International Center for Peace and Development, and The Mother‚Äôs Service Society in collaboration with the World Academy of Art and Science have worked to formulate a broader theoretical framework for understanding human development.
 Strategies arising from this approach were presented at international conferences co-sponsored with the Gorbachev Foundation in Moscow and with the Noor al Hussein Foundation in Jordan, and were effectively applied to stop hyperinflation in Yugoslavia.
 A full and conscious application of strategies arising from this framework can help to condense the period of transition of East European countries and the take-off of less developed countries from decades into a few years.
 From this perspective, the single most important agent of human development is not the institutions of government or those of private enterprise.
 It is the educational system that imparts to future generations the accumulated knowledge, skill and capacity acquired in the past.
 The quality of that education will determine the quality of the human beings who build our future world.
 Until now, too much emphasis has been placed on transfer of information from teacher to student, too little on the development of thinking and critical faculties by the student.

His twin swords itched in his hands.
 Qurrah, sitting next to him in a little back alley next to Ahrqur‚Äôs old home, laughed.

 The bigger half-orc smashed his swords together, focusing on the pain the shower of sparks caused his hands.

This evening was a wonderful end to a wonderful day.
 Like the day before, what Rick had enjoyed most was seeing Marie's pleasure.
 She'd wanted to see everything, experience everything they'd let her try.
 Everyone had treated her like an eager tourist, little realizing that she was seeing it all from the perspective of someone who'd seen debuts of Hollywood's earliest offerings.
 "Would you like to go dancing?"
 Rick asked as he paid the bill.
 "I don't think so.
 I'm rather tired, and I think I'd just like to relax and think about all that happened today."
 "And dream about your debut?"
 He smiled.

"I feel torn completely in two.
 I don't think I can ever be happy again.

 But if I were to stay here, I'd miss my family, my home, my roots.
 I'd feel misplaced.
 I'd worry about my family and how upset they are and how they'd always wonder what had happened to me."
 She took her toothbrush and put toothpaste on it.
 "I understand.
 But that doesn't make it any easier."
 Tossing his washcloth into the clothes basket, he picked up a brush, and when she straightened after having brushed her teeth, he began smoothing her hair with long, slow strokes.

He breathed in through his nose and tried to ignore his newly youthful hormones.
 This time when he pushed her shoulder she went back but did not stumble.
 ‚ÄúSee, you stayed in control.
 You stumble in a fight and you are dead.
 With your center low you have control.
 You are ready to dodge and to strike back as needed.
 Plus, you have leverage.
 If you develop good foot work and keep them moving and you keep your center of gravity low, you can win against stronger but less-disciplined fighters.‚Äù They both nodded, for the moment convinced.
 ‚ÄúNow watch and try to learn this basic form.‚Äù Rodregas stepped into position; his knees deeply bent, his hands loose but raised just below his shoulders.
 He stepped forward and raised his left arm in a sweeping block and then he took another step and struck out in a swift blow to an imagined attacker with his right hand.

 Well, almost anything.
 She had to go home.
 She jumped when she heard Rick's door open.
 Glancing at him, she turned and headed downstairs.

He took his tea out to the garden.
 Gazing at the white roses, he sighed, wishing Marie would come down and share the beauty of the morning with him.
 He couldn't blame her for being mad, but he was getting desperate.
 He felt as if he were in a race to convince her to marry him before they reached a point where they were unable to stop themselves from making love.
 He couldn't keep pushing her away forever.
 It was a wonder he'd been able to stop himself--and her--this long.
 Being here was like being on vacation, she'd told him.
 He sipped his tea, trying to imagine what this was all really like for her.
 He remembered his first trip to Europe, the summer after he‚Äôd graduated from college.
 He'd spent a month in Great Britain and had loved it.

Donovan had met us at the door and conducted us to the dining room, where Alec and his friends devoured a sizable meal.
 Even back when I'd had a more substantial appetite, I still couldn't have kept up with the wolves.
 Even the girls packed away more food than I would've believed possible for such slender frames.
 I mentally shrugged and added it to the list of shape shifter benefits.
 Able to eat like a complete pig and still slip into size zero jeans.
 Dominic spent a couple hours after dinner helping me with Spanish.
 She probably would've spent even longer with me, but Mom called, so Dominic slipped out to give me some privacy.
 I fielded something like a hundred questions about school, reassured her two or three times that she wasn't a terrible mother, and promised yet again to stay one hundred percent out of trouble while she was gone.
 I was beginning to wonder if I was ever going to get off the phone when she finally decided, ultra-late shoot tomorrow or not, she'd better go to bed.
 By the time I finally finished up the rest of my studying, decided I was ready for my catch-up test in Mrs. Campbell's class tomorrow, and spent a few minutes with Rachel, I was well and truly exhausted.

I ducked Vincent's first blow and retaliated with a gash that opened one side of his chest nearly down to the bone.
 A dark-furred form leaped at Jasmin, but the other wolf mistimed the spring.
 Most of the other pack didn't appreciate just how nimble she was.
 Jasmin dodged to one side and then the two of them were circling, looking for an opening.
 Vincent, the other hybrid, attacked with the strength and fury that'd earned him the position of second in his pack, but he hadn't been expecting to face me in this form.
 As a wolf I weighed in at a solid two hundred pounds, but would've still given up more than a hundred pounds to him.
 Now I had at least six inches and seventy-five pounds on my side of the equation, and he was the one pressed onto the defensive as the fight progressed.
 I caught flashes of action from the other fight as we circled each other.
 Jasmin sprang at her opponent, catching her behind the shoulders as Vincent reeled away from me in a shower of blood.
 I'd finally managed a deeper strike on his arm.

I vowed to keep it on as I shook away a thought from the dream coming back to me and headed for the door.
 It was a gloomy day and I didn‚Äôt miss having to squint away the bright sunlight.
 Early as it was, I decided to take the long way to town, meandering through the fields and thinking of all that had passed in the last days, until I reached a patch of weeds that reminded me of Evelyn‚Äôs taunting.
 I felt a momentary spasm in the pit of my stomach at the thought of her choking.
 And then I remembered growing the weeds in the garden and I was suddenly in a rush to get to Junnie‚Äôs.
 I rapped our special knock, and in a heartbeat, Junnie was opening the door.
 ‚ÄúMorning, Freylina.

 ‚ÄúYes, I want to practice growing.‚Äù She glanced at the pendant against my chest.
 She was silent for a moment as she looked into my eyes, almost searching.

The music was fairly hideous, but it did spare me having to try and be friendly before I was fully awake.
 Of course it also stopped me from digging further into the mystery of why it was so dangerous to hike.
 That particular question would probably have to wait at least until lunch.
 Mrs. Sorenson looked up as I walked into a nearly empty class, but I was on time, even if only barely.
 I'd heard of teachers taking an instant dislike to one of their students, but I'd never experienced it first hand until now.

 I felt my ears go hot as the three other girls in the classroom giggled.
 I slunk out of class as soon as the bell rang.
 English went better.
 Mr. Whethers got the class involved in a discussion of Heathcliff's motivations, which kept everyone occupied for the full class time, and distracted me from what was likely to happen when Britney and I got to algebra.

He dodged down and then in close and with his hands free simply grabbed the opposing squire from the top and bottom edges of his breast plate.
 He then heaved the armored man in the air, something even he could only do for a moment, and then slammed him down onto the smooth sands of the arena.
 Nordien hit with such force that his arms and legs flew like a small doll‚Äôs.
 Rodregas fell on top of the armored form, grabbed the bottom of the helmet, and ripped it off.
 Unfortunately, it was firmly secured.
 When Rodregas ripped it off he took a good section of jaw with the helm.
 Rodregas then threw the helm aside and punched the man in the face, full strength, several times.
 His first hit smashed the front of Nordien‚Äôs face.
 The second blow shattered it.
 The third blow smashed the head to pulp.

Andrew wasn't in the class, and his friends were probably spending almost as much time thinking about their odds of still winning, as I was.
 I only had three chances left, three in two hundred assuming that everyone else in the school had entered the drawing, which was virtually guaranteed.
 "And the third lucky person is Suzanne Bergerman."
 And my chances were down to two, with even worse odds than I'd had a second before.
 My hands hurt, only when I looked down to see why, it was because my fingernails were digging into my palms.
 The blood was pounding so furiously in my ears that I couldn't hear the next name read.
 I could tell it wasn't mine though because nobody turned back to congratulate me.
 There was only one name left to be read, and I knew that it wasn't going to be mine.
 I'd never been that lucky in my entire life.
 As quickly as that my pulse slowed and my fists relaxed.

 ‚ÄúJazell!‚Äù Seth yelled, but his voice was muffled by the dirt flying everywhere.
 I grabbed at something, anything, but there was no hold.
 ‚ÄúSeth, where are you?‚Äù I thought that he said something but, I couldn't hear him.
 All I could hear was the blood pounding in my ear and my racing heartbeat.
 Dirt fell into my mouth and I coughed, trying to get rid of it.
 My vision was closing, getting dark.
 I'm tired...

I would leave this wretched place behind.
 I made my stance more formal to match his as I said, ‚ÄúI want to learn transfer magic.‚Äù His mouth tightened and he turned his head, a half shake.
 ‚ÄúYou taught me fire,‚Äù I argued.
 ‚ÄúFor protection, Freya.‚Äù ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I begged.
 He hesitated.
 I didn‚Äôt know how to convince him.
 Was it too soon for me to learn?
 I knew there was an order to the spells, knew you must earn the knowledge.
 If you went too fast or out of sequence you could endanger yourself.

I imagine if some good Christian folks would suggest that God might have sent her to me, others would assure me she was in the devil‚Äôs employ.
 Whether she came from God, the devil, or by pure coincidence is academic to me.
 If instead of her, Father Abraham would‚Äôve appeared and reminded me that he was willing to not only surrender his son but to impale and burn his own child, I wouldn‚Äôt for a moment consider following his lead, even as far as the give her up part.
 These days, with my big kids and Pam off in the world on their own, Zo√´ is my only real treasure.
 Around the time she was born, I often wrote for the San Diego Reader.
 My editor asked me for a story they would call ‚ÄúOld Man, New Baby‚Äù.
 Here is a condensed version: It could be a gender difference, or an individual one.
 All I know is that I never thought much about having kids until I had one.
 Laura, my first wife, wanted kids.
 So when they weren‚Äôt happening, being the agreeable fellow I can be now and then, I got a simple operation and zap.

A Bigger Change
 Since Kenny‚Äôs dad was football coach across town at Coronado High School, Kenny transferred there and would graduate, and meanwhile bat leadoff on their baseball team.
 Eric became a lot boy at a Lemon Grove Ford, a ten minute walk from Sylvia‚Äôs house.
 The next couple of weeks, I only saw Eric on Sundays, his day off, and when I stopped by in the evenings, I would find him lying on his bed, reading.
 Sylvia‚Äôs Catholic Bible.
 Or Dickens‚Äô Tale of Two Cities, in which Sydney Carton goes to the guillotine as a willing sacrifice for people he loves.
 Or Joseph Conrad‚Äôs Heart of Darkness, about a fellow who, deep in an African jungle, encounters the hellish depravity of human nature, and assumes it as his own.
 Eric listened to me as long as I wanted to talk.
 But he didn‚Äôt care to talk much himself, except about how this expulsion had transformed him.
 He was learning what it meant to work full days, to budget money, and generally act responsible.

It was a protection spell.
 I ran.
 As I shot through the rooms, all I could think of was not getting caught.
 I shoved the pages under my shirt before I made it through the last door.
 The village was crowded with elves, oblivious to my horror.
 The protection spell must have only alerted council.
 I ran from town and pushed through the brush at the edge of the village, taking the shortest direction out of the boundaries.
 I kept running until I became winded and then hastily searched for some kind of shelter.
 Burrowing deep in a briar patch, struggling to catch my breath, I wrenched the wad of papers from under my shirt, buried them in the soil beside me, and then waited for my punishment to come.
 But no one was coming.

He laughed to the others and then punched Harruq in the gut.
 As the half-orc doubled over, the guard grabbed his hair and tugged.
 ‚ÄúGot to be a disguise,‚Äù he said.
 Another guard used the hilt of his sword to strike Harruq‚Äôs back.
 The blow blasted the air out of his lungs.
 The leader of the guards tugged all along Harruq‚Äôs face, pulling hair and scratching skin.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúIt is real.
 No illusion and no disguise.

Every step kicked up a miniature cloud of fine, red dust that drifted into my lungs and slowly coated my clothes.
 The dust would've been plenty bad all by itself, but the heat made things even worse.
 It was only an hour or two removed from the hottest part of the day, and the air was so dry it sucked moisture out of me with each breath.
 I knew it was stupid to walk home.
 My one little bottle of water wasn't going to last me five miles in this oven, but I was tired of always having to be sensible about everything.
 I was going to walk, and that was it.
 Maybe if I passed out on the side of the road and ended up in the hospital Britney would finally realize what a wench she was.
 I was barely out of sight of the school, still vividly imagining Alec and Britney's faces when they found out that they'd put me in the hospital, when I heard a car approaching from behind me.
 Only it wasn't zipping by, it was slowing down.
 Every scary story I'd ever heard about rapists, kidnappers and murderers suddenly flowed through my mind like frayed ropes catching at my insides as they went, pulling out all of the other thoughts and feelings until there was nothing left but a hollow, fear-filled shell.

But, then, it was like we were doing something extraordinary and perhaps not entirely wholesome.
 We drove home in compete silence.
 And when we got home, we undressed as if it were all scripted, as if this was the end of that chapter.
 And when we were both naked, we fell together into the bed.
 And we fucked and cried and cried and fucked and it was all ok.
 If only for a little while.
 It was shortly after this that I left Memphis for good.

And how it would benefit him.
 I turned to him, glaring, and he drew back, startled.
 ‚ÄúIs that what you want, why you are so intent on marrying me?
 For my power?‚Äù He shook his head, mystified.
 The rage had overtaken me, though.
 The weeks of drugging Rune, sneaking out, my missing father‚Äîsearching for a new wife, I was sure‚Äîall of it too much.
 I slipped.
 A small crack in my stability let out enough magic to hurt him.
 I didn‚Äôt hit him, but the surrounding trees and rocks were pulverized and I knew I had done too much.
 He stared back at me‚Ä¶ afraid.

 Inside felt like a modest rendition of Ahrqur‚Äôs home.
 Stairs in the center led to the upper floor.
 Harruq charged up them, making no attempt at silence.
 Either they would hear him through the chaos of battle or they would not.
 It turned out they did.
 An arrow flew across the room and pierced his shoulder when he reached the second floor.
 He bellowed, letting the pain spark his rage.
 One archer continued to fire out the window, believing his companion capable of finishing a single warrior.

 "Sometimes."
 She smoothed the bedspread.
 "Did Davis make you feel that way?"
 "Never.

 I did talk to my mother the next morning and told her that I had met the woman I was going to marry‚Äîand it wasn‚Äôt either of the two brunettes in my bed.
 Gimme a break, it was the eighties!
 The bartender made a call for me to his girlfriend in an attempt to get my dream girl‚Äôs number.
 I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be easy because as it turns out she knew of me through high school and my reputation preceded me.
 Would this ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù give her number to a ‚Äúbad boy?‚Äù The ploy worked and somehow Lisa agreed to let me call her.
 Lisa had been dating a guy for years and I knew of him.

Chevelle flicked his wrist and the flame dodged up and angled back toward me.
 I shook my hands frantically, spitting sharp bullets of heat at it, hoping to break it up.
 But he pulled his hands apart and the thing split, each side curving toward me; there were two now, closing in fast.
 I leapt forward just as they collided where I‚Äôd been standing and lost my footing while I watched the fireworks behind me.
 Spinning into a tumble to keep from landing flat on my face, I rolled to my feet, still thrilling from the fire play.
 From magic.
 I let out a breathless laugh and Chevelle joined in, though in all fairness, he might have merely been amused by my fall.
 We spent the next several hours there in the meadow, sculpting my craft.
 The exercises grew increasingly more difficult, but it seemed Chevelle was only toying with me.
 He must have had experience with fire magic; the flames he produced behaved like an obedient dog.

A sound behind me drew attention to how quiet the valley had grown as we watched this unanimated brawl.
 And in an instant, how still.
 Steed and Chevelle broke their stare, turning to the noise‚Äîdogs, I thought‚Äîbefore the entire world shifted into action.
 Ruby was gone, vanished from beside me, and I was whisked from my seat, catching only a glimpse of Steed and Chevelle darting past.
 In less than a heartbeat, I was standing over the rocks in the opposite direction, Ruby before me, red curls blocking my view, arms outstretched in readiness.
 Steed and Chevelle were at opposite angles in front of us, both tensed, even more so than they had been in their bout.
 I peered around Ruby‚Äôs mane to see what they were focused on.
 In front of our triangle, directly ahead of Ruby, stood a reedy, blond elf, draped in the long white robe and tassels of council.
 I felt sickened as I absorbed the idea that a council member‚Äîis he a tracker?‚Äîhad been behind me as we were all engrossed in a trivial match.
 He was frozen, unmistakable agony distorting his features.

What surprised her was how Qurrah remained asleep as well.
 Dieredon had mentioned nocturnal visits between the other brother and the man in black, but she had no idea how long they lasted.
 For Qurrah to still slumber they must last for several hours, if not the entire night.
 She looked at him, sprawled out on a thick pile of straw, and wondered how he managed to walk, let alone cast spells as Harruq implied.
 His skin was pale and had a stretched look across his bones.
 He looked like a drained, emaciated version of his larger brother.
 _A good set of meals would do him wonders,_ Aurelia thought.
 Boring as it was, Aurelia sat down and prepared to wait.
 She glanced around, making sure there was no chance a wandering passerby could accidentally bump into her invisible form.
 The sun moved along its path in the sky, and the brothers finally awoke.

But if I thought I could never go home--"   She shuddered.
 "When I'm missing my family, thinking about seeing them again and thinking how ecstatic they'll be is the only thing that keeps me from complete despair."
 She opened the hand clenching the diamond and held it out to him.
 "I'm sorry, Rick.
 I love you, but I can't marry you."
 Reluctantly he took the ring, pocketing it as he watched her rise and head for the bathroom.
 She didn't know what he did‚Äîthat she could go home tomorrow.
 She'd calm down, and then things would go back to normal.
 Eventually she'd accept that her life was here now.
 She'd have to accept it.

 A grin spread wide across his ever-changing face, chilling Harruq‚Äôs spine.

 So which side do you think will have the privilege of our blades and magic?‚Äù

It was of average make, and he did not like such large swords.
 The weight provided a lot of momentum and power for a strike, but if you missed it was hard to recover and very easy to leave yourself wide open for a counter strike from your opponent.
 It looked like the guards had gone to celebrate ‚Äúhis‚Äù birthday by taking most of the better armor and weapons with them.
 Rodregas grabbed a shield as well, and a barrel of the best looking arrows and carried them to the front entrance.
 There was probably money in the purser‚Äôs office, but he knew that the door, as well as the room was rigged with poison needles and other traps, both mundane and magical.
 Rodregas had the impression that Ravenhurr had spent most of his wealth of late on the Dire Cats.
 After Rodregas‚Äô recent generosity, he did not want to take the risk of dying for a nearly empty treasure box.
 He looked out of the entrance, over to the gate and up to the top of the wall where a small tower provided cover.
 There, one of the few guards left should be watching the front gate.
 Also kept in the tower were two of the nicest weapons Rodregas had ever seen: a pair of recurve bows of Wood Nymph created black yew.

Emily‚Äôs mom was short, small and bony.
 Her light brown hair was almost blonde without any gray in it.
 The woman definitely did not look her age at all, and she was still as beautiful as I imagined she was in her youth.
 She smiled warmly at us, her smile a reflection of Emily‚Äôs.
 ‚ÄúHello girls, come in.
 Emily, dear, can you put your laundry away?
 After you do that, you can hang out in your room.‚Äù Emily nodded and disappeared inside.
 Her mom moved aside so I could walk in.
 I unlaced my sneakers and walked up the stairs, looking at the flower paintings hung along the wall that her mom had painted in her spare time.
 I pushed open Emily‚Äôs bedroom door to see her stuffing her clothes in the drawer and flopping onto the bed.

The ceremony required the prisoners to stay in each circle unbound.
 The job of the guards was to remain outside the circle but make sure that the prisoners stayed inside.
 Metal would interfere with the magic so the guards held simple wooden clubs and wore only linen clothes with no metal fastenings.
 As Rodregas pushed the half AElf into her circle, making sure not to disturb the bluish sand covered in swirls of colorful small crystals, he was surprised at how vulnerable he felt without his armor but readied himself for the task at hand.
 He quickly reached out to the woman and pulled off her gag, as even that would count as a binding and would interfere with the ritual.
 He wanted to whisper to her as he removed it, and give her a hint of the desperate gambit that he was about to try, but he knew that it was not worth the risk of others overhearing.
 Both of their lives depended on her doing what Rodregas had told her.
 If he succeeded, she would know what Rodregas had done; if he failed, well he was familiar enough with that feeling.
 He saw her lips forming something under her breath, probably a spell, but she did not have time to execute a spell of sufficient strength in the time left her.
 Magic took too long to prepare to be useful so quickly.

Within were a few small villages with no government, no ruler.
 Karak brought his troops to establish order.

I pulled out my old, unabridged copy of Les Mis√©rables.
 Every so often I'd try to make it through Victor Hugo's weighty classic, but so far I'd never made it past Marius' introduction.
 Having just finished up Pride and Prejudice for the third time, I was once again due to try and make it through the written inspiration to some of my favorite music.
 I hardly noticed the slow journey into town, instead caught up in a different time and place as Valjean's story started to unfold.
 All too soon, the bus pulled up to a medium-sized, two-story brick building, and five kids my age stood up to leave.
 I followed them, my heart beating a little faster with each step.
 Other kids were trickling over to the door, either from one of the other two buses, or from the smattering of cars in the parking lot.
 Before we'd even made it inside I'd realized just how much I stuck out.
 Shorts seemed to be the order of the day, knee-length khakis for the boys, and everything from mid-thigh on up for the girls.
 The only people in jeans seemed to be the debate-club types.

‚ÄúSomething must be wrong with me,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúShut up and start telling me more about yourself.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúJust do it.‚Äù
 So the half-orc shut up, paused, shrugged, and then began.
 ‚ÄúWell, this isn‚Äôt a happy tale, but it‚Äôs the only one I can think of.

The progress it heralds is no more inconceivable and remarkable than the chain of recent achievements seemed seven years ago ‚Äì yet those we have already come to take for granted and, underinsistent prodding by the media, to replace in our consciousness with ever new concerns.
 PROSPECTS FOR THE YEAR 2005
 According to the provisions of international treaty, the final batch of nuclear weapons has been destroyed, ushering in a world free of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
 Global military spending has fallen by nearly 50 per cent since 1994 to $400 billion per annum (in 1990 US dollars), half of which is now contributed to a global military force responsible for enforcing a total ban on war between nations.
 Not a single inter-state or civil war is raging due to the extension of the UN's mandate to prevent all forms of war and its vastly strengthened military capabilities.
 International drug trafficking has declined by more than 80 per cent since the signing of the UN declaration granting the UN special powers to eradicate the drugs trade.
 An accelerated schedule for dismantling trade barriers and the formation of regional economic unions, such as the Middle East Economic Area that incorporates Israel and the Arab states, and other initiatives to promote larger bilateral trade between countries and regions, have helped to more than double the growth rate in world trade.
 With the assistance of the UN's World Development Force, proposed in this report, food shortages have been eliminated from the last famine danger zones in Africa, and total food production on that continent has doubled within a decade.
 Poverty is its direct forms has been eradicated in China and India by strategies that have led to the creation of hundreds of millions of new jobs.
 Rapid economic growth in developing countries has acted as a powerful engine for vigorous expansion among the industrialized nations.

‚ÄúI know some about the binding.
 I‚Äôve studied it.‚Äù When he stopped, I said, ‚ÄúAll right.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what he was getting at.
 ‚ÄúThe problem is‚Ä¶ meddling with the bindings, meddling with your mind is‚Ä¶ well, it‚Äôs dangerous.‚Äù And there it was.
 ‚ÄúDangerous,‚Äù I repeated.
 They let me consider that for a moment.
 They were being careful with me, didn‚Äôt want to upset me.

It felt funny to smile.
 The gesture belonged with perfect times, not ones in which people other than me were having nervous breakdowns.
 Then again, a bad night with Alec still somehow managed to beat most other good nights.
 "Everything was almost perfect.
 If there was anything less than ideal, it wasn't your fault."
 "Still, I'd like to make it up to you."
 He looked down at my ankle and then smiled with a hint of mischievousness.
 "I suppose dancing is out, but I think I've got something that'll do just about as well."
 Alec carefully picked me up before I could respond.
 A few seconds later we were outside, traveling through the darkness with a breakneck speed that would've been suicidal with merely human vision.

Telling me that I am unconditionally loved by that a man several centuries dead is supposed to cure all my ills?
 How does that work?
 Ned ‚Äì When you realize that Jesus loves you, you will know that all of life‚Äôs problems can be overcome by faith in God, that is how it helps.
 And if you take Jesus into your heart, then God will know that you are ready to receive his help and you will be saved from hell.
 All human discomfort is just a test of strength to sort out the unworthy and separate the wheat from the chaff.
 All humans really need in life is faith!
 Art ‚Äì Humans don‚Äôt need than faith.
 Faith is just a crutch to lean upon.
 A way to convince yourself that there is some reason for all the pain and humiliation.
 Rather than grasping reality and actually doing something to help the world, people with faith just wait for luck to see them through.

Alec had picked me up and carried me out to a massive SUV that I'd never seen before.
 Everyone piled in, and despite the seriousness of rapidly approaching events, I fell back asleep somewhere en route to our destination.
 Apparently you couldn't drive all the way though, because we were walking again, or at least some of us were.
 I could just make out Isaac off a little ways into the darkness.
 He was in hybrid form and moving with a ground-devouring gait that was deceptively smooth.
 Flashes of movement off to either side of us, lower to the ground, made me sure the girls were all following along on four legs.
 Alec shifted me around as he realized I was awake.
 "We've still got nearly half an hour, you should get some more sleep if you can."
 I tried to argue but couldn't find the strength.
 A while later the flash of light as James and Isaac lit flares pulled me back awake.

As this evolutionary process unfolds, each element of human personality -- physical skill, vital relationship, mental understanding, spiritual values ‚Äì is enhanced in a progression without end, bringing with it greater material fruits, richer life experience, and higher knowledge.
 The unfolding and flowering of the human being is at once the source and the goal of development.
 Thus, in all our efforts to elevate human society, our primary endeavour must be to enhance these human endowments and expand individual freedom of self-expression.
 Peace, democracy, employment opportunities, food security, education, training, access to information, cooperation, freedom of action and a spirit of innovation are the essential conditions and means for this process to advance.
 There was a time when humanity‚Äôs progress was primarily the result of the collective efforts of the community, demanding and obtaining the strict obedience and conformity of its individual members to preserve what it had created and further the progress of the collective.
 That point is now past.
 In the century now commencing, the individual human being must come into his own as a free and creative force.
 The groundwork has been prepared by the spread of democracy, human rights, universal education, gender and social equality and, more recently, information empowerment.
 The power of individual awakening is responsible for the revolution of rising expectations that has fuelled unprecedented rates of growth and social transformation during the past half century.
 That same power can be seen among the talented youth of developing countries today, who are awakened to the prospects of a better life and aspiring for higher accomplishment, either at home or in ever increasing numbers abroad.

Their words trailed off once they were close enough to see clearly.
 Flesh hung from their bones, pale and rotting.
 Wounds spotted nearly every one, although no blood poured from them.
 Their saviors were men, orc, and elf, but they were dead.
 ‚ÄúAshhur help us,‚Äù an exhausted farmer murmured before the line advanced upon them.
 The Forest Butcher at their heels, they could not run.
 Velixar‚Äôs army of undead tore the seven apart and cast their remains to the dirt.
 So ended the last life of Cornrows.

I pulled the string back and released it.
 The arrow whizzed through the air and sunk into the creature‚Äôs belly.
 It shook and fell to the ground.
 Seth ran from underneath it right before it crushed him.
 He turned around and studied it.
 Then there was a horrible sound, like ripping metal.
 The belly of the creature seemed to open up and winds picked up.
 Seth threw down his sword as the wind sucked at him.
 He tried to keep himself from being pulled in.
 I ran up to him with Emily and Jason right behind me.

 Still, even this late, one wishes, with the advent of the compact disc revolution, that it would be reissued.

‚ÄúImeralda says that you are almost as powerful as me as a magician.
 If we found a way, would you like to take on some of the power of the sigils?‚Äù he asked.
 Rodregas had expected an immediate response, but instead his question was followed by a long pause before Doi‚Äôvan answered.
 Rodregas had learned that Doi‚Äôvan thought before speaking.
 ‚ÄúI am not sure.
 I like learning magic, though I am just beginning.
 I would think that I would take on a minor sigil or two.
 I am a great warrior, but I like to learn new things and I would like to have sufficient magic to be able to learn spells.‚Äù Rodregas nodded.
 Doi‚Äôvan‚Äôs response would have surprised him before, but he had learned much of the thoughtful Hellborn in their time together.
 When one looked at him and how powerfully built he was, it was incredible to imagine what he could do on the battlefield with a greater sigil added to his power.

My suspicions were confirmed when Dom sighed with relief.
 It hadn't just been my imagination.
 Alec's will had been sufficient to the task, but its victory hadn't been assured.
 It was a terrible risk to run, one that apparently put a big fat target on his chest for anyone in the pack who wasn't happy with how things were currently running, but Alec ran it regardless.
 He ran it again and again because doing so gave his pack a slight chance of survival, and he couldn't deny them that chance, not when there was something he could do to put it within their reach.
 That wasn't the kind of person who'd take advantage of my human weakness to seduce me.
 In fact, it was all too likely he was going to fight my every effort to bring us closer together precisely because he didn't want to take advantage of me.
 I was suddenly very certain though that I was going to wage that war.
 I couldn't not want him, not love him, any more than he could do less than his best to keep his family from harm.
 Chapter 28 Alec was completely drenched in sweat, and I still wanted to throw myself at him so badly my teeth hurt.

Kapow, our race is a goner.
 See that coming and, walloped by dread reality, spooked beyond reach of old customs and authority, our nature cries, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs out there somewhere, whatever it is.
 Go find it.‚Äù Eric and I bought Kerouac‚Äôs On the Road, and checked out Dharma Bums and his latest, Big Sur, a memoir in minimal disguise, about a fellow who goes to a cabin in the forest to recover from drunkenness and fame.
 Imagine Henry David Thoreau as a neurotic who returns to Walden Pond and finds psychosis awaiting him there.
 Still, we concluded that a poet of Kerouac's passion and skill, who could make a hangover feel romantic, would pull out of his tailspin and rise again.
 That fall, Eric and I read most every day, then sat in my backyard or on a beach or sea cliff and talked for hours at a spell.
 Also, we worked at odd jobs, sold some possessions, and saved most of whatever our moms gave us.
 We needed gas money, so we could chase visions of Kerouac and his Beat pals through the places they haunted at the west end of their cross-country odysseys.
 Twice that fall, the minute school let out on Friday, we sped north on Highway 101.
 From Morro Bay to Santa Cruz, we followed the coast and made camp for the night on a cliff between Hearst Castle and Big Sur.

I think we must choose carefully.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan said and added, ‚ÄúFor me the Bunei seems right.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan paused in that thoughtful way he had, considering all sides before taking action.
 ‚ÄúIf it consumes my Infernal power I would gain its strengths.
 If I am lucky, what magic ability I have left will be mortal or Celestial in nature.
 The Bunei are creatures of magic, they are both great warriors and thinkers and magicians and are even known to sometimes help others.
 I cannot pass this chance up.
 I must see what will happen.‚Äù Rodregas nodded; they both knew they would not get this chance twice.
 Doi‚Äôvan saw in the Bunei what Rodregas had felt in the lion in the main hall.
 ‚ÄúSee any good Infernal sigils for me?‚Äù Rodregas asked.
 ‚ÄúI should bind my Infernal gift as well, especially as I will never be a great magician.‚Äù Rodregas had not really expected an answer, but Doi‚Äôvan surprised him by nodding his great head and pointing to the far back almost in a corner that strangely was the only one in shadow.
 ‚ÄúI think the Ni‚ÄôBarrbari, the daemon known as the Night Panther, would add a bit of subtly to your Celestial Lion.

"Then you'll try again Tuesday morning."
 He squeezed her hand.
 "Don't worry, Marie.
 You'll get back sooner or later.
 And until you do, I'll take care of you.
 I promise."
 She went upstairs with him and said goodnight outside her bedroom door.
 But her heart began pounding with panic as she thought about the day she'd just spent in 2011.
 She'd worn trousers in town, and she'd embraced a man in public.
 And now she was spending the night alone with him in his house!

"I'm fine, Mom.
 Just feeling a little run down.
 I'll spend the whole weekend lying around reading and studying.
 That should fix me right up."
 I gave Mom a wan smile, exactly the kind I used when I was really sick, and helped her finish packing.
 I wasn't sure whether I helped because I was feeling guilty, or because I was worried Brandon would show up before she'd left.
 Maybe I was just hoping to kill two birds with one stone.
 It wasn't until she was finally in the Jeep and backing down our lane that I finally stopped worrying that Brandon was going to pop around the corner.
 He'd been smugly confident he wouldn't show up before she was gone, but had refused to tell me how he planned on pulling up at my house five minutes after the coast was clear.
 Half of me was strongly tempted to dawdle for fifteen or twenty minutes, but with my luck he'd really manage to show up within the next few minutes, and I'd have to scramble to get ready while he waited for me.

Over the last two centuries in countries around the world development has strengthened expansive values that encourage greater freedom, tolerance, individual initiative, self-confidence and self-respect, dynamism, risk-taking, efficiency, punctuality, organization, communication and cooperation, open-mindedness and respect for new ideas, innovation and creativity.
 At the same time development has weakened values that support respect for tradition and hierarchy, seniority and authority, self-effacement and humility, patience and perseverance, generosity and self-sacrifice.
 The nineteenth century tolerated values based on the exploitation by people over people through slavery, colonialism and war, and the domination of nature by man.
 The guiding values for the coming century are freedom and respect for the individual, social equity, tolerance of human diversity and harmony with the environment.
 Development is widely regarded as the cause of moral decline and increasing corruption, crime and violence.
 These negative consequences are primarily due to the fact that freedom has been extended to vast sections of the population which were confined in the past by rigid social barriers and minimum expectations, so they never had need or occasion to embrace the values they now eschew.
 The earlier self-restraint has been replaced by a self-assertion that has not yet acquired the productive values needed for achievement.
 Rising expectations enhance this tendency.
 While it is true that corruption is more prevalent today than ever before, it is also true that the entire global economy functions on the basis of a faith, honesty, openness and tolerance that would have been inconceivable in the past.
 We mourn the loss of cloistered values, which were very often accompanied by narrow rigidity and provincialism, while failing to recognize the enormous growth in positive human values that has made possible the incredible progress of the past few decades.

I'm not lying for you or anyone else."
 Rachel piped up unexpectedly.
 "It's okay, Britney.
 If you want to leave we'll give her a ride home."
 I could see the wheels turning in her head.
 If I really did have a ride, she could leave without ruining things with Brandon; but if I wasn't going to lie, then there was a good chance that Mrs. Campbell would find out she'd left early.
 Parents were relatively easy to fool.
 Leave the tutor lab early, go somewhere else and kill some time until you were supposed to come home, and they'd never know the difference.
 Teachers were a little harder, but if you didn't have the help of your 'friends', then they became an insurmountable obstacle.
 The gears finally ground to a stop and Britney sighed as she put her head down on the table.

He was not sure how Geriodon or Nordien or the other leading contestants were doing.
 At the bell the two started to circle.
 Karun was a large woman.
 She was tall and unusually muscular.
 She moved with an easy cat-like grace and was attractive, in an about to kick your ass sort of way.
 She was probably of the blood and strong.
 She had her brown hair woven into a tight braid and wore well fitting chain and leather armor.
 Her sword and shield seemed to be of excellent quality.
 Rodregas tried to get a good hold on his shield.
 It was battered and not looking good.

Once it‚Äôs done, he can‚Äôt get out.
 In the morning, Eric read it.
 No doubt he could have told me the theme wasn‚Äôt much different from my dream of going off with Karen to a secluded cabin, or from my quitting the baseball team so I could spend afternoons alone smashing golf balls.
 But Eric rarely gave answers to questions we could solve on our own.
 In that, he was like God, who perhaps respects us more than we deserve.
 In The Brothers Karamazov, Fyodor Dostoyevski gives a story of Jesus coming to earth during the Spanish inquisition.
 He only heals a few of the suffering crowd before soldiers arrest and deliver him to the Grand Inquisitor.
 That old fellow commences to tell him where he went wrong.
 Jesus, says this astute theologian, attempted to give people freedom, when most of them want nothing to do with freedom.
 Their cravings are for food and other comforts, for easy answers to questions no matter how complex or perplexing, and for entertainment, to relieve them of the need to think.

That we weren't normal like everyone else."
 "Like the...dayborn?
 What did you mean earlier?"
 Alec was quiet for so long that I thought maybe he wasn't going to answer.
 "That touches on the things you shouldn't know."
 "Please.
 It will help me go to sleep.
 I need something else to think about."
 It was a bit of a white lie.
 As soon as he'd touched me everything else ceased to matter.

Economic liberalization has unleashed people‚Äôs expectations: witness the rush of Chinese peasants to invest in the stock market and the increasing demand of Indian villagers for a range of consumer goods.
 The same movement continues in the West as increased physical and social mobility, the growing demand for higher education and the widespread urge for greater recreation and travel.
 These expectations are the seed and driving force for social progress.
 They provide the energy and create the openness and willingness for change.
 But they also increase the danger of frustration, disappointment and violence.
 The end of the Cold War was expected to usher in an age of peace, but actually violence is on the rise in both developing and developed countries because of the widening gap between human expectations and achievements.
 This growing gap between expectations and achievements is at the root of contemporary turbulence worldwide.
 The popular and some times violent demand for freedom and participatory democracy, the return of religion in politics, surging ethno-nationalism and intolerance, and rising urban crime are disparate expressions of this phenomenon.
 In Eastern Europe, where a peaceful revolution from within has broken the shackles of statism that long confined the energies of people, these energies now surge forward in high and eager expectations of a better life.
 Already there are growing signs of impatience, disappointment and frustration arising from the greater hardships that have come in place of the greater benefits that all expected.

I released the tube and turned slowly toward Fannie.
 She was livid, red-faced and shaking.
 She stepped toward me, and I slid the pouch that lay against my leg behind my sash.
 She didn‚Äôt seem to notice.
 The blow was quick, and I hadn‚Äôt seen it coming.
 My head turned with the contact, whipping back toward her before I had a chance to rein in the shock and anger.
 Fannie‚Äôs eyes lit with anticipation.
 Like she wanted me to fight back.
 I had never even talked back to Fannie.
 I didn‚Äôt have the size to fight her, let alone the magic.

Alec is probably the most controlled person I've ever met, and Isaac is so disciplined he's almost immune to the power plays.
 Even so, sometimes it's like they operate on a shorter fuse than the rest of us."
 My throat was so dry it took me two attempts to clear it.
 "Could Alec have won?"
 The question stuck in my throat, reluctant to come out.
 It felt disloyal to Alec but I had to know.
 "I don't know.
 Individually Alec could take any of them.
 There's a reason he's dominant to all of the rest of them.
 James is a hybrid too.

 Because they had convicted me.
 I might have asked how the process would work, but I was too furious to pursue conversation with any kind of composure.
 And it didn‚Äôt matter, because they‚Äôd already counted me guilty.
 I was staying bound.
 I let out a frustrated growl, clenching my jaw shut.
 He was one of them.
 I had to remember that.
 I might have run back to the village right then, but they would never release me.
 I had nothing.

Brandon didn't look at me like I was losing it though.
 "You're not the only one to realize she's dangerous, it's just that Alec's family has a lot of influence, and so far she's avoided doing anything they couldn't cover up."
 I drew a deep breath and nodded.
 "Okay, I don't remember exactly what she said, but she was mad at the other girl, Lucy.
 Something about staying away from a boy, I don't remember if she said his name.
 Then Jasmin said she didn't believe Lucy was sorry, and that she'd kill her if Lucy didn't stay away from him."
 Brandon nodded slowly.
 "The boy's name's Ben.
 I'm not sure why she's fixated on him the way she has, or why she views Lucy as such a deadly threat to her chances with him, but it's essentially that simple."
 I felt like my head should be reeling from the sheer stupidity.

The dead guard‚Äôs small shield, though, was near his feet.
 Rodregas quickly grabbed it as he made some room and switched his short sword to his right and the shield to his left.
 This time they spread out and started to circle.
 Rodregas took a chance before they got too close and glanced over at Doi‚Äôvan.
 In one of those weird moments that happen in battle, he saw the path between them was open.
 He was also backing up, surrounded by three more foes.
 ‚ÄúAt least they are all slavers.‚Äù Rodregas thought.
 Rodregas scooted back and said, ‚ÄúBack to back.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan gave a grunt of acknowledgement, and they faced in opposite directions.
 They were quickly surrounded.
 Another final Immortal Guard stepped into the circle, increasing the odds against them.

I eliminate them as they drive past.
 I am looking for one of two cars I believe they will be driving.
 Will it be the red Dodge Charger or the white Lexus sedan or perhaps a complete surprise?
 One way or the next, they know where I am and what I am driving and exactly where I am parked.
 I have met Ashley, so she should have no problem identifying me.
 I focus on the occupants of car after car.
 I am far too tense to be sleepy, but I am dazed by the constant parade of memories and possibilities that march through my head as I attempt to digest thousands of thoughts‚Äîhell bent on answering the question: Why do I sit here?
 It has been many years since I have been involved in a drug deal, and my assumption is that the process hasn‚Äôt changed much.
 My mother has been through too much pain and I can‚Äôt imagine what affect it would have on her to visit another family member in jail if things go badly tonight.
 I think about the deep secret I have now and what my mother would think, and those defining moments that led me here.

He also found a small statue of a strange green mechanical frog that had that magic tingle to it.
 He could not imagine its use; it appeared a simple toy, but he put it in his pile to take.
 There was a heavy oak cabinet in the corner which he forced open.
 Inside were large pottery containers, which he had seen before.
 They held some of the magic powders used to make the circles that were so important to many of the most powerful of the Immortalist‚Äôs spells.
 He checked the powders for magic and several came off very strong so he added them to the pile.
 Two came off with the foulest feel yet, even worse than the books in the studio.
 He could not burn them but knocked them into the middle of the room and then added a couple of the other non-magic powder containers.
 In his final action before he left, he used the crow bar to shatter all the bottles, and made sure to mix the powders together.
 He hopes that would make them impossible to use.

I heard them, but my mind refused to assign meanings to the sounds.
 It wasn't until he'd moved his arm and rolled out of bed with his characteristic speed and grace that I finally realized he meant to take me to the Lilac Room and then return here to sleep.
 I suddenly had a hard time breathing.
 The idea of lying alone in the dark, in the very room I'd just seen Brandon demolish, sent my heart into an erratic rhythm.
 If there'd been an EMT present they'd have already been charging up the defibrillator.
 Alec turned around while I was still trying to get my throat to work again.
 "You stopped breathing.
 What's wrong?"
 The tears his touch had dried up a few seconds before were back, and just seconds away from escaping the corners of my eyes by the time I finally pulled myself up onto my knees and managed to speak.
 "Please don't send me there.

 ‚ÄúYeah, well, you heard what I said yesterday,‚Äù Harruq said, his face red.

It looked as if they lived in a small western town and were a real family.
 "Are that woman and man really married?"
 she whispered.
 "No.
 She's married to the show's producer, I think.
 It's her fourth marriage."
 "Fourth!"
 She didn't know anybody who'd been widowed three times.
 Before her eyes, the scene changed completely.
 A man was in the shower, and someone was singing.

But for Rick it was perfect.
 Both his office and his neighbors were close but not too close, and he had a beautiful lawn in the front and a large patio and flower garden in the back.
 Rick smiled as he walked into his kitchen, loosening his tie.
 Lauri moaned every time she walked into the garden.
 What a waste, she always sighed, looking at him with reproach.
 A woman would love having that garden, but what did a man know about flowers?
 Truthfully, he knew very little, Rick mused as he set his cartons of Chinese on the counter and went to change clothes.
 He just knew that he enjoyed their beauty and scent.
 But he could never admit that to Lauri; she'd accuse him of being a romantic.
 He really was, deep down, he supposed.

"Have you been to Vegas yet?"

 Britney perked up at my answer.
 "We¬†so¬†have to go down there soon.
 It's the only place within an hour and a half where you can do any decent shopping."
 Normally the prospect of driving for hours to watch someone else spend money I didn't have, sounded roughly as appealing as laying out naked at the pool until I had second-degree burns on my whole body.
 Then again, maybe burns wouldn't be so bad if they let me disappear into the anonymity of a large crowd in an actual city rather than dealing with hick hostility.
 "That sounds great; I can't wait to get out of this stupid town."
 A couple of people started a bit, and I heard a locker slam shut with surprising force.

The process was so smooth, I couldn‚Äôt say exactly what had happened.
 Chevelle was changing.
 Or, more likely, he was becoming more himself.
 He wasn‚Äôt as formal.
 He seemed relaxed, and apparently magic, quick and powerful, was intertwined into his every routine.
 He didn‚Äôt need to do much by hand; I would have spent hours trying to build a spit and skin an animal.
 An old question came back to me and I asked, ‚ÄúHow do you hunt?‚Äù ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a bow,‚Äù I explained.
 ‚ÄúWhat do you use to hunt?‚Äù He hesitated, as if deciding what to tell me.
 ‚ÄúI use magic, Frey.‚Äù He looked like he was waiting for me to be upset.
 ‚ÄúOh.‚Äù I contemplated his answer.

The euphoria generated by the end of the Cold War led to high expectations of peace and a ‚Äòpeace dividend‚Äô the world over.
 Yet excitement soon turned to disappointment as the full anticipated results of these magnificent accomplishments did not immediately materialize.
 Then, as attention turned to more mundane problems closer to home, the sense of relief and celebration was replaced by growing concern over the increasing prominence of other threats to international security: some of these were aggravated by the new positive developments, while others had not previously seemed so serious by comparison with the threat of nuclear annihilation.
 The end of political confrontation between East and West, the sudden conversion of authoritarian communist states into demo cratic market economies, and substantial cuts in global defence spending were accompanied by increasing political instability and ethnic violence in the many parts of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, by the horren dous loss of life due to civil and ethnic strife in several African countries, by growing concern over drugs and violent crime in the West, by the danger of nuclear terrorism resulting from potential theft of Soviet weapons, and by pressure on defence producers to compensate for reduced domestic defence budgets by increasing arms exports.
 This surprising turn of events has led some to re-examine the incredible achievements of the period and conclude that they were either vastly overstated or, perhaps, even illusory.
 Others have come to take these achievements for granted.
 Still others have simply forgotten how much things have really changed.
 But the most important realization to be derived from these events is of the inherent defect in attempts to address the factors underlying international security in a piece meal manner.
 Over the past five years the Commission encountered reminders of this truth in virtually every field that it took up for examination.
 It is this experience that has convinced us of the need for wider perspectives and total solutions.

As he slipped into a desk an aisle away from me, I tried to breathe deeply and slowly in a futile effort to calm my racing heart.
 It helped a little when he slid the desk back a few feet.
 As long as I watched Mrs. Alexander I couldn't see Alec anymore.
 It seemed like I could still feel him though.
 The right side of my body hummed and tingled, almost imperceptibly, telling me he was there.
 I did my best to ignore the sensation, concentrating on the pictures rapidly forming on the ancient blackboard as Mrs. Alexander diagrammed the conceptual model of a wave, and started dissecting the various parts.
 Crest, trough, period, amplitude.
 None of it was hard to understand, not particularly interesting, but still a welcome distraction.
 After what seemed like an eternity, Mrs. Alexander placed the piece of chalk she was using behind her other ear and smiled at the class.

His father had imparted to him all he had learned in his lifetime and all their ancestors had passed down before.
 They bred the animals methodically, striving to combine certain traits, bring them together in a single horse.
 With each generation, they strengthened the line, even bringing in new breeds from other lands to add to the list of desired attributes.

 I faded off somewhere during the part about bloodlines.

 Ruby didn‚Äôt question why I would be sleeping again so soon.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, the rise was from 1.9 per cent to 3.9 per cent and it is expected to reach 5.8 per cent in 2005.
 In the former Soviet republics, growth has accelerated from 0.1 per cent to 4.1 per cent and projected to touch 6.6 per cent next year.
 These trends are likely to continue throughout the decade.
 While foreign aid to developing countries as a percentage of GDP has fallen by 50 per cent since 1990, it has been offset to some extent by a 150 per cent rise in foreign investment.
 In the least developed countries, foreign aid has declined by 24 per cent but this has been offset by a 29-fold increase in foreign investment, so that the combination of foreign aid and foreign investment as a percentage of GDP has remained constant.
 If the rich countries, particularly USA, had met the UN development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of GDP, progress in improving the human condition in countries characterized by a high incidence of poverty would have been faster.
 These real and significant gains have been offset and to a large extent obscured in our minds by the persistence and aggravation of problems that constitute the other side of the post-Cold War ledger.
 Far from vanishing, the nuclear danger has been aggravated by the continued proliferation of nuclear weapons, the increasing danger of these weapons falling into the hands of terrorists, and the stubborn refusal of the existing nuclear powers to seize the opportunity to totally eradicate this pernicious arsenal of self-annihilation.
 Reduced confrontation between nation states has been followed by an aggravation of internal conflicts within countries as well as a dramatic increase in threats of violence by disenchanted minorities.
 Violent local conflicts continue to flare around the world.

He returned with a novel that he pretended to read.
 His mind was replaying all the day's events, and he kept peering at Marie over the top of the book.
 She'd washed her makeup off, and she looked like a child, her lashes dark against smooth, rosy skin, one small hand beneath her cheek.
 She was such an innocent young woman and was, as he‚Äôd read, vibrant and fun-loving.
 Even her natural fear of having walked into the future was more often than not suppressed by her sense of adventure.
 He wanted to protect her, now and in the past.
 When he was sure she was asleep, he went to his own room and took out the pages he'd copied before his sister‚Äôs dance.

It was bright green all right.
 I stood up and examined myself.
 I was wearing light brown hunting boots and tight black pants made out of some sort of light cloth.
 A thick woven jacket was shielding me from the October cold.
 When I looked back at Seth, I realized he had also made an outfit change.
 He was wearing black leather boots and dark blue pants.
 His top was a short, brown cloak with a hood and leather belt.
 A beautiful steel sword with an ornamental hilt was swinging at his side from a woven sheath.
 ‚ÄúOh well, I guess I have green hair.
 It‚Äôs not that bad.

 CHAPTER TEN
 Marie dressed slowly the next morning.
 She hadn't felt such an ambivalence about her walk since .
 .
 .
 since the morning they'd left for Hollywood.
 Had that been only nine days ago?
 It seemed like a long time.
 Rick was in the hall waiting for her.

 So, I did that.

When he really pushed the issue, his house mysteriously caught on fire."
 My mouth was hanging open, but Britney seemed to think it was disbelief rather than amazement.
 "I'm serious, Adriana, and I'm not letting you take my family down with you.
 Find your own way home."
 Chapter 6 There was no reason for Britney's actions to come as any kind of surprise, it was exactly in keeping with her character.
 Even if she didn't believe a word of what she'd just told me, I really was on my way to becoming a social pariah, and her whole existence centered around becoming more popular.
 Even so, knowing I was officially stranded at school with no way home felt very much like the end of the world.
 We still didn't have a phone, and probably wouldn't for weeks to come, even assuming we somehow managed to keep our home through the end of the week.
 Calling Mom and asking her to come and get me was out.
 Presumably if I waited long enough Mom would decide something was wrong and come looking for me.

We told no one.
 It needed to be our immediate family‚Äôs dirty little secret.
 Thomas and I had fallen out because of his continued preference for drugs and that lifestyle and an inclination toward our biological father‚Äôs proclivity for untruths and big scams.
 The last thing I wanted was for Thomas to be a part of this.
 Oh, how he would rub my face in this shit.
 You would think with all my experience around drugs that I would have known what to do.
 That is exactly what I thought!
 Brandon was sickly and skinny.
 My wife lay with him for hours rubbing his back and keeping fluids in him.

He'd never kissed her arm before.
 When he was gone, she dropped onto her bed with a smile.
 But it slowly became a frown.
 She was beginning to think she didn't understand her betrothed at all.
 She'd never seen him get angry before he‚Äôd proposed.
 And she'd thought that being betrothed would mean they'd spend more time together, but they were actually spending less time together.
 He had dinner with her family two or three times a week, but he and her father always retired to her father's study for the rest of the evening.
 And they'd only gone out alone twice.
 Considering the pattern of the past five weeks, Marie was thrilled when Davis told her that he was taking her out to dinner the next Friday evening.
 But it turned out to be completely unlike the night of their betrothal.

‚ÄúHey Seth, it‚Äôs not like you haven‚Äôt done something stupid.
 We all remember the swamp troll.‚Äù Seth frowned and Jason snickered.
 Seth punched his arm.
 ‚ÄúHey don‚Äôt make me nag you about the time you almost took off my head with your throwing knifes.‚Äù Jason stopped dead and narrowed his eyes.
 ‚ÄúIt was an accident.
 I didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôd run that way.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlright, we understand that we‚Äôve all done stupid, foolish things.
 So let‚Äôs just add this accident to my list, okay?‚Äù I said quickly before the two started something.
 They nodded but shot each other smirks.
 I sighed, wondering why those two buffoons had been granted this power along, with Emily and me.
 It‚Äôs not like they weren‚Äôt foolish enough already.

 ‚ÄúYes, I didn't lose my hearing for nothing, because I had to listen to you scream.‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you ever going to drop that?‚Äù I asked.
 Seth smirked.
 ‚ÄúNope, it's going to haunt you for the rest of your life.‚Äù He made ghost sounds.
 ‚ÄúWait,‚Äù I said suddenly, ‚Äúweren't you going to tell Emily and Jason about you-know-what?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Seth asked lazily and plucked at the grass.
 I sat up and glared at him.
 ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, 'what'?
 You said you were going to tell them!
 I'm going to tell them if you aren't.‚Äù I stood up, but Seth was faster.

Peace, democracy and development are inseparable and interdependent.
 Liberal democracy and economic opportunity for all are essential ingredients for winning the war against terrorism.
 Accepting the spiritual principle which tells us that there is an element of truth even in the most outrageous or misinformed viewpoint, we must not only vehemently condemn but also sincerely recognize the unaddressed issues that underpin the urge for violence.
 In this sense, terrorists crudely expose the mental insincerity prevalent in international politics.
 Those who wield national power must come to realize that force of compulsion will not bring about a permanent reconciliation and amelioration of relationships in human affairs.
 Superior power must bring with it a superior sense of fairness and a commitment to constructive dialogue and action to attack the root causes of terrorism.
 It must shed its own accretion of mental insincerity cloaked as diplomacy.
 Then and then only these movements of violence will shrink and finally disappear.
 The period following September 11th, as US National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice put it, is one ‚Äúnot just of grave danger, but of enormous opportunity.‚Äù
 Resolving Local Conflicts: The Commission concluded that the end of the Cold War made it possible to successfully resolve problems that had resisted solution for decades, such as the many violent communal and ethnic conflicts occurring in the world.

I lingered there, clutching it tight in my hand.
 It was a comfort to hold.
 It seemed to warm something deep within me.
 I vowed to keep it on as I shook away a thought from the dream coming back to me and headed for the door.
 It was a gloomy day and I didn‚Äôt miss having to squint away the bright sunlight.
 Early as it was, I decided to take the long way to town, meandering through the fields and thinking of all that had passed in the last days, until I reached a patch of weeds that reminded me of Evelyn‚Äôs taunting.
 I felt a momentary spasm in the pit of my stomach at the thought of her choking.
 And then I remembered growing the weeds in the garden and I was suddenly in a rush to get to Junnie‚Äôs.
 I rapped our special knock, and in a heartbeat, Junnie was opening the door.

It was like keeping so many secrets for her brother had made her especially sensitive to other people's secrets.
 Another few steps brought us to the door, and I held it open for Rachel to follow me outside.
 The intense heat felt like a physical blow.
 I could almost feel my pores open up in an effort to keep me from overheating.
 The sensory overload as my eyes tried to adjust to the unfiltered afternoon sun momentarily distracted me.
 It wasn't until I heard the other door swing shut that I realized James had followed us through, but he'd taken the door on the right instead of the one of the left that I'd been holding open for him.
 Wow, talk about a chauvinistic pig.
 It wasn't worth getting bent out of shape.
 I let my door swing shut, and walked over to Rachel's side so that I could see the entire parking lot.
 Empty as it was, it didn't take very long to realize Britney's little white Saturn was gone.

I sat up and my back cried out in protest.
 I pushed myself into sitting position and crawled over to Seth.
 He had his arms behind his head and was staring at the sky.
 He smiled at me when he saw me.
 ‚ÄúYou okay?
 You freaked out before,‚Äù he asked, his voice full of concern.
 I nodded and answered shakily, ‚ÄúYou know that I hate falling.
 You must have been scared too.‚Äù He hesitated.
 ‚ÄúYes, I was, but I think I was more concerned that you would wake the dead with your screams and they would attack us too.‚Äù I smacked him lightly on the arm and laid down next to him.
 I stared at the sky.

Speaking to the One Tree was wonderful; the One Tree is here and not here.
 Somehow it can be reached from here I think is the best way to describe it.
 But there is no sigil to be had.
 The tree ‚Äòspoke‚Äô to me as trees do, and it explained about the ‚ÄòBlessing of the One Tree,‚Äô that is probably why it was here like the greater sigils.‚Äù Imeralda spoke in a conversational tone but also like she was amazed by her own story.
 She continued, ‚ÄúI think for a Nymph the Blessing of the One Tree is like a sigil.
 It directs your magic and focuses it as the Tree of Life wants it, but not by binding it into a shape.
 It heals your spirit and makes you more‚Ä¶, well, more of a Nymph,‚Äù she said, her voice was a tone of sunlight and happiness.
 For reasons Rodregas did not understand he felt great.
 ‚ÄúSo, why do you have to climb up a hundred feet to the end of a branch to get a blessing from a tree?‚Äù Imeralda laughed and then yelled down to Doi‚Äôvan, ‚ÄúTake your boots off and your harness and your weapons and climb up on the top of one of the big roots.
 That should work, you have to be on the One Tree and then I will show you the blessing.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan looked like he wanted to argue but with Rodregas‚Äô nod of encouragement he followed her request, and Imeralda stepped closer and she held three golden fruits.

Yep, we can hear the helicopter, but we can‚Äôt see it through trees and tent.
 The noise gets louder and louder and it suddenly drops down behind the podium.
 The wind from the swirling blades intensifies and the flower displays that sit on tripods start to fall forward and the tent begins to rattle and shake, the wind starts to uproot the tent from the stakes which anchor it.
 The helicopter is facing us and begins to slowly maneuver to expose its side.
 The tent is ripped from the ground and tumbles away leaving a clear view of the black helicopter that is lowering itself closer to the ground.
 The helicopter is about thirty feet above the ground, and now just behind the podium, over the limos.
 The side door slides open revealing two men in black suits.
 Everyone starts to dive for cover.
 I am seated next to Grandpa but I am now flat on the ground with the rest of the crowd attempting to duck the flying flowers, tripods, and debris, expecting a shower of bullets.
 Chairs are scattering as they tip over and who knows what those two men in the helicopter are going to do?

Vincent took an angry swipe at the last, a small female, and then our pack burst from the trees.
 A second later, our enemies were in full rout.
 Splintered Excerpt Alec had been promising to take me somewhere new for nearly a week, but pack business kept getting in the way.
 I'd been expecting some posh restaurant in Vegas or maybe LA.
 The world kind of becomes your oyster when you've got your own jet.
 The last thing I'd expected was a picnic up at the top of the mountain that cradled the Graves' estate between large, rocky spurs.
 It was perfect.
 For Alec money was nothing more than a useful tool, but he understood I still wasn't comfortable having that tool used to purchase me things I didn't really need.
 I'd set out determined to hike the whole way up to the top, but I was still a little weak.
 Apparently everyone had been right about just how much blood I'd lost the night our pack had destroyed the local rival pack.

Rodregas glanced to the ground hoping to see the previous guard‚Äôs blue steel long sword.
 It would do a lot to give him at least a chance against these odds, but it was nowhere to be seen.
 The dead guard‚Äôs small shield, though, was near his feet.
 Rodregas quickly grabbed it as he made some room and switched his short sword to his right and the shield to his left.
 This time they spread out and started to circle.
 Rodregas took a chance before they got too close and glanced over at Doi‚Äôvan.
 In one of those weird moments that happen in battle, he saw the path between them was open.
 He was also backing up, surrounded by three more foes.
 ‚ÄúAt least they are all slavers.‚Äù Rodregas thought.
 Rodregas scooted back and said, ‚ÄúBack to back.‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan gave a grunt of acknowledgement, and they faced in opposite directions.

Not even some of the most prominent agricultural economists expected the gains in food production which have occurred in the past several decades.
 An international team of experts visiting India in 1963 projected a mere 10 per cent growth in foodgrain production by 1970, whereas growth actually achieved during this period was 50 per cent.
 Neither technological, nor financial nor natural resources pose insurmountable obstacles to achieving dramatically more over the next 15 years than is indicated by past trends or current projections.
 The idea that hunger cannot be conquered because we are running out of land to support rapidly burgeoning populations is contradicted by the facts.
 Globally, there is no correlation between population density and hunger.
 China, with only half as much arable land per capita as India, produces 13 per cent more foodgrains per capita.
 Taiwan and South Korea have only half the farmland per capita of Bangladesh, yet they produce 40 per cent more food per capita.
 Tiny Netherlands, with the highest population density in the world, produces more than sufficient food to feed itself and remain a large net food exporter.
 Currently 11 per cent of the world‚Äôs land surface is used for agricultural crops, just 4 per cent more than in 1960.
 A comprehensive theoretical study of soils, climate, vegetation and topography conducted in 1975 indicated that both land and water utilized for agriculture could be doubled, if necessary, and that the earth could support 36 times the 1975 level (18 times the 1990 level) of cereal production using the same share of cultivated land.

It came out as something less than a whisper, but apparently Alec's hearing was acute enough to catch that too.
 Alec drew me close, heedless of the open door and the twenty staring kids.
 He placed the side of his face against mine and whispered into my ear.
 "I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
 If there's a way to keep you safe I'll find it."
 The feel of his breath caressing my cheek sent tingles racing through my entire body, but even that couldn't completely reassure me.
 Still, I gave it my best effort, and if my smile wasn't entirely convincing, it was at least good enough to temporarily reassure Alec.
 I followed him into class, pausing while he handed his note to Mrs. Sorenson.
 It was almost worth all of the craziness and exhaustion of the last seventy-two hours to see her eyebrows rise in astonishment as she read the innocuous piece of paper essentially giving Alec carte blanche in her classroom.
 "This is highly irregular, Mr. Graves.

Do you know the source of Magic?‚Äù he asked her.
 Imeralda nodded, ‚ÄúSure, there are four sources of magic: mortal, Celestial, Infernal and elemental.
 It is one of the reasons I am prized for my potential with more than one power.
 My AElven ancestry is strong with mortal magic, but my Nymph side is strong in elemental magic.
 If an Immortalist takes my power, he or she could become stronger in both.‚Äù ‚ÄúMostly correct,‚Äù Jordaan said.
 ‚ÄúIt is actually a topic of much debate among magicians.
 I go along with the belief that there is no such thing as ‚Äòmortal‚Äô magic.
 While we don‚Äôt have time now to go over all the proof, the general thought is that mortals are truly just animals and don‚Äôt produce magic.
 It is only our connection to other realms that provides us power.
 Mana is the raw energy of magic no matter what its source.

 As Dieredon fought for his life, Harruq and Qurrah snuck through the streets of Woodhaven.
 They avoided the light of lamps at all costs and stopped only a moment so Harruq could don his new armor.
 They had to be careful, for if any saw the two half-orcs traveling amid the dark their lives would be forfeit.
 When they neared Celed, Qurrah halted.
 He stared down a particular street for a long while before closing his eyes.
 Harruq waited in silence.
 ‚ÄúThat is the way,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúIt will be the only gated home.‚Äù

4.Modify tax policies:The present income and payroll tax system raises the real cost of labour relative to other resources, such as capital and energy, and thereby discourages job creation.
 It heavily taxes people for working, which indirectly raises the cost of labour and reduces the number of jobs.
 At the same time the system provides investment and depreciation incentives that encourage indus try to shift from labour-intensive to capital-intensive modes of production.
 Much of the shift from labour to capital might not be economically justified were it not for the in-built bias in this system.
 Low levels of taxation on the depletion of non-renewable energy resources in the United States is another distorting influence that makes machine-driven activity more cost-effective than it would otherwise be.
 5.Analyse job impact of government policies: Almost every government policy has a direct or indirect impact on employment.
 Often the relationship is not recognized or intended.
 An analysis of the impact of major public policies on employment at the local, state and nation level can result in avoidance or removal of significant legislative and administrative roadblocks to job growth.
 Require employment assessment of new policy initiatives prior to adoption.
 6.Re-orient social security programmes toward re-employment: OECD countries spend 2-3 per cent of GDP on labour market policies, most of it to support the unemployed.

 how could she give up everything she'd ever known?
 Rick handed Marie his handkerchief.
 "I'm sorry, sweetheart.
 I'm sorry that you feel torn.
 But I have to tell you that I'd give anything in this world to have you stay here with me.
 I love you so much."
 Fresh tears rolled down her cheeks, and she laid her head on his shoulder.
 She dabbed at her tears with Rick's handkerchief, noticing that it smelled like his cologne.

But Marie clung to him, rubbing her face against his neck.
 "Kiss me again, please," she murmured, raising her head to press her lips to his.
 He couldn't resist her, and his mouth began moving over hers again.
 But at last he forced himself to break away.
 "Marie, we have to stop," he told her, literally holding her at arm's length.
 "Why?"
 she panted.
 "Why don't you want to kiss me any more?"
 "I want to--I just can't.
 Let me cool off a minute."

He hoped she'd forgive him soon.
 He'd hate to waste a whole Sunday fighting.
 He took his tea out to the garden.
 Gazing at the white roses, he sighed, wishing Marie would come down and share the beauty of the morning with him.
 He couldn't blame her for being mad, but he was getting desperate.
 He felt as if he were in a race to convince her to marry him before they reached a point where they were unable to stop themselves from making love.
 He couldn't keep pushing her away forever.
 It was a wonder he'd been able to stop himself--and her--this long.
 Being here was like being on vacation, she'd told him.
 He sipped his tea, trying to imagine what this was all really like for her.

 "Maybe.

 "We'll get one of the next size too."
 "May I help you?"
 Both Rick and Marie turned to the salesgirl.
 "We'd like to see some casual shirts for her," he said.
 "OK--we have some really pretty ones that just came in."
 She led them to a rack.
 "There are some more in the corner over there."

Jasmin had about the least reason out of any girl alive to be an expert hair dresser since her naturally wavy hair could just air dry and still look like she'd spent hours working on it, but an expert she was.
 The results of her efforts on Rachel's behalf were nothing less than spectacular, and the casual-looking knot of curls and twists was wispy in all the right places.
 Even with Rachel currently an order of magnitude hotter than normal, Jasmin still captured the prize.
 Rachel's work on her behalf had resulted in a makeup job that was so incredibly understated, even us girls had a hard time detecting it.
 Her wavy brunette hair had been straightened and pulled back in what looked like an attempt to let some other girls shine for a change, but it just made her look like a goddess who'd decided to spend the night slumming.
 Given who she'd spent the last hour being surrounded by, it was no wonder Dominic was worried she was the ugly step sister.
 She needn't have worried.
 Her features were even more exotic than Jasmin's, and Rachel had chosen bright colors that made her stand out much more than usual.
 James' macho cool really was going to finally crack tonight.
 Maybe I could pull the dress off after all.

 "I'm sorry, honey.

She didn't want to go out there and ask Rick's opinion.
 She blushed again at the thought of people seeing her like this.
 But people would see her at the shore tomorrow, so she pushed the curtain aside and stepped out.
 "Rick?"
 He looked around.
 And his mouth fell open.
 She had a fantastic body.
 He never would have guessed it.
 Well, except for the time she'd tried on the jeans.
 She had shapely legs-- "Rick?"

‚ÄúI will return tomorrow.
 Early.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said, flush with emotion.
 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt ever want you to go.‚Äù I laughed and he drew me closer.
 ‚ÄúStay with me.‚Äù I started to pull away and he reached up, placing his hands on either side of my face, feverish now.
 ‚ÄúMarry me, Lizzy.‚Äù I had long since gotten used to the name, but I wasn‚Äôt sure he was talking to me at first.
 It seemed ridiculous.
 I stopped myself from laughing, knowing from previous experience this would hurt him.
 I had come to realize he didn‚Äôt know what I was.
 He knew I was different, of course, knew of the magic, though I‚Äôd shown him nothing of my real power.
 But he didn‚Äôt understand I was an elf.

Was it the same spirit in the night that whisked away all these mortal souls?
 I don‚Äôt know.
 I only tell stories.
 Buddy got his first musicmaker, a ukulele, when he was a sapling, six years old, a first-grader at Idlewild Elementary.
 He hung onto that uke as if it was his lifeline, time and time again having it taken from him on the playground where he would serenade a few curious classmates with his bewailing renditions of old Hank Williams songs.
 The end of most schooldays found little Buddy in the principal‚Äôs office explaining why he should get his instrument back and vowing never to bring it again.
 Until tomorrow.
 At twelve Buddy had graduated to electric guitar, a gift from his father, Al Gardner, who had played clarinet with a dance band called Dick Delisi and the Syncopators, at the Vapors Supper Club in his own mis-spent youth.
 Buddy‚Äôs mother, Elise, could only pull at her hair and clap dishpan hands over her ears when the noise emanating from Buddy‚Äôs room began.
 To her it sounded like the can-opener on warp speed.

He was a killer and nothing more.
 His legacy would be one of death and emptiness.
 The ghosts of the village clung to his back and neck.
 His choice was made.
 When he looked to the stars, he saw Aurelia‚Äôs face among them.
 He tried not to think of what she‚Äôd say if she knew what he had done.
 Guilt and regret meant nothing so he choked it down.
 It didn‚Äôt matter what he wanted.
 His oath was made.
 His swords had swung.

The attack had been more sudden than usual and nobody had been close enough to catch me.
 In those circumstances experience had shown that I led with my head.
 "It was just the heat here.
 I'm not used to it.
 Now¬†please¬†put me down."
 Alec looked at me doubtfully, then took a deep, no doubt calming breath, and shrugged.
 The movement seemed too casual, almost as if he was angry, but trying to hide it.
 I wanted to try and make eye contact to test my hypothesis, but was afraid of what I'd see.
 The tingling was spreading, no doubt a bad sign.
 Maybe I'd hit my head even harder than I thought.

He was in the local jail and had been calling friends to bail him out.
 Our son hadn‚Äôt called us for bail; I had told him that he shouldn‚Äôt bother me when he got busted, one thing I had said that had apparently sunk in to his thick head.
 He was alive‚Äîa relief‚Äîbut we had no idea how much trouble he was in.
 The thoughts of trial and incarceration were unthinkable, but they were likely.
 The memory of accompanying my mother half way across the country to visit my brother in jail came back strong.
 I called the jail and received minimal information beyond his bail amount.
 We opted to leave Brandon in jail.
 He was released 23 hours later on his own recognizance.
 Brandon spent the days after his release from jail back at our home as we attempted the daunting task of detoxing him.
 Through withdrawals again!

I have just turned fifty years old, which is older than the combined age of the young couple who will be meeting me.
 It is early 2009, and the drug I have in my pocket was not even available when I was a teenager.
 In my younger days the contents in my pocket would have been cocaine or marijuana, but times have changed.
 The eventual recipients of these pills will be the addicts who crave them more than a next meal or the love of their family, or anything for that matter.
 The pills are small, round and an odd green color‚Äîa powerful prescription drug manufactured to relieve severe pain.
 They are essentially synthetic heroin, and much sought after by the drug addicts who litter your streets, work alongside you and perhaps sit next to you at a family dinner.
 They are daughters or sons or parents.
 The street price for these pills could reach up to $80 each while the co-pay at the pharmacy for the insured who are prescribed these pills could be as little as $10 for a quantity of ninety.
 That is quite a tidy profit for all involved, and the sellers do not care what casualties wait.
 That is about all that stays the same in the drug world decade after decade.

 I wanna talk about ‚ÄúTurntable Poison,‚Äù in particular some of the things that have been written about it.
 Some analysts of the record see things in it, which I‚Äôve heard you deny, yet, there does seem to be something underneath the surface of these songs, something darker.
 Dave Marsh described it as ‚ÄúMansonish deviltry mixed with Buffalo Springfield lyrics and Cream jams.‚Äù  It‚Äôs this Charlie Manson element that I‚Äôd like to hear you talk about, this school of thought that the record is some sort of coded message, a hint of what was to come, a gateway to the Apocalypse, according to Crawdaddy.

 Not what's best for me, or what you think is best for me, but what you really want?"
 The silence seemed to stretch into hours before Alec finally shook his head.
 "Good, because I don't want to leave.
 You said last night that your life felt meaningless before I came here, well, mine was even worse.
 The only thing that's kept me sane has been your behind-the-scenes help.
 I want to stay with you.
 I want to be with you."
 Alec studied me for a moment longer, and then nodded, a short, choppy motion with little if any of his usual grace.
 "Very well then.

The threats to future peace come in many forms and at many levels, but unquestionably the most pernicious and potentially devastating is the peril from nuclear weapons.
 The end of the nuclear arms race between the superpowers may have removed the looming fear of all-out nuclear war and annihilation that surfaced in the artistic drawings of young American school children in the mid-1980s, but the horrible genie of Hiroshima and Nagasaki will continue to haunt us until every nuclear weapon has been destroyed.
 The very existence of the nuclear stock piles carries its own inherent dynamism for their utilization, which is likely to be expressed intentionally or accidentally sooner or later.
 There have been repeated efforts by the non-aligned nations to move a resolution in the UN General Assembly that the use of nuclear weapons should be declared a crime against humanity and outlawed.
 One hundred and twenty-six nations have voted for the resolution.
 It is ironic that the opposition to this resolution and justification for the continued possession and possible use of nuclear weapons come solely from the most militarily, politically and economically powerful group of nations, which are militarily without adversary and at the same time in the best position to afford and institute alternative means for their national security.
 Here lies the real key: the insistence of the few most powerful nations on perceiving security in their own terms, and their insatiable urge to achieve ever more of it for themselves at the expense of greater insecurity for others and the world as a whole, even though their goal can never be achieved on this unilateral basis.
 During the Cold War, nuclear weapons were legitimized by the five permanent members of the Security Council which are the nuclear weapon states.
 Now that it is over, the governments of these nations seek to justify continued possession and the option to use these weapons, even while exerting every possible pressure to stop proliferation to other countries.
 The very logic which the nuclear weapon states rely on to support this policy, however, makes the acquisition of these weapons extremely attractive to non-nuclear powers.

 Besides, it wasn‚Äôt as if he could think of anything to say.

 By the time his jaw and mind began working again, Aurelia was laughing.

 The elf smiled.
 ‚ÄúNothing.

Can he ki...beat Brandon?"
 Isaac's sigh was eloquent.
 "I'm forbidden to speak on these things.
 To do so risks no small amount of Alec's displeasure."
 "But you're going to anyways, aren't you?"
 "It is right that you know the sacrifice undertaken on your behalf, both by Alec, and by the rest of our family.
 The one because of his feelings for you, the other because of our respect and love for Alec."
 "It's true then; he can't win."
 "While it isn't impossible, it's unlikely.
 Alec is a remarkable fighter, to hear Donovan speak of it, he's possibly even almost the equal of his father, but Brandon's strength and speed have not seen a match in centuries.

The easiest thing would have been to stay quiet and just let her believe I'd played an integral part of the project, but I didn't like getting credit for something I hadn't done.
 It was the worst kind of lying.
 "Mrs. Alexander, I didn't actually do any of it.
 I kept making mistakes."
 She chuckled so hard, for a second I thought the pencil behind her ear was going to fall out.
 "I rather suspect you're understating your accomplishments, my dear.
 Didn't contribute indeed.
 As if Nora's favorite student would just sit around while there were equations to solve."
 I felt like I'd been hit in the stomach.
 I hadn't realized just how fond of me Mrs. Campbell was.

She was so much fun, and he loved knowing that she'd be waiting for him when he got home.
 Sometimes the intimacy of living with her was a strain--sleeping and showering under the same roof, shopping for underwear and doing laundry, lazy evenings when he held her close.
 She was beautiful and sexy, and he ached to kiss and caress her and make love to her.
 But he cared about her too much to press her.
 "Marie!"
 he called when he got home that afternoon.
 "I'll be down in a minute!"
 He went to the kitchen and set the pizza on the table.
 As he was filling glasses with ice, she padded into the kitchen.

Marie tried to smile, but the thought of that wedding gown, that symbol of tradition and family and home, upset her.
 Yesterday it had made her long for home.
 Now it made her long for Rick.
 She wanted to wear it for him.
 She certainly wasn't going to wear it for Davis.
 After breakfast Mr. Tranton went to call his daughter‚Äôs betrothed.
 Marie was in the living room with her mother and brother, and they jumped when they heard him begin shouting.
 They'd had only enough time to look at each other in bewilderment when Mr. Tranton joined them.
 "Young Runyon will be here within the hour."
 Understanding dawned, and Marie said quietly, "He didn't want to come until after work, did he?"

She pulled out my bag and threw it to me so I could set up my sleeping bag on her rug.
 Her mom called us downstairs, hopefully for food.
 She held a box of pizza.
 ‚ÄúYou two can eat upstairs or down here.‚Äù She already knew our answer and handed us paper plates.
 I took three slices of pizza and ran upstairs.
 Emily and I sat on the floor, eating pizza and doodling nonsense in her notebook.
 The time ticked by to one o‚Äôclock in the morning.
 We sat side by side on her bed near the window, and I played with the fridge on the edge of one of her pillows.
 I looked down at Emily‚Äôs pajamas, which were covered in sun-tanning penguins.
 Typical Emily.

He knew that Jordaan could not really keep his arm from moving.
 He kept thinking that the ordeal would be over soon.
 When it continued he started to worry about his ability to keep from jerking away from the small figurine.
 Just when he was sure that he could not keep his arm still the pain smoothed and stopped.
 As Jordaan relaxed his grip and released him, Rodregas shook his arm and then his body, trying to feel the difference.
 It felt almost like someone had drawn all over him from the inside, but there was no visible difference.
 There was no sign that a bit of his magic had been used up in the creation of a permanent effect.
 Rodregas sat and watched as Doi‚Äôvan and then Imeralda undertook the inscription of the minor sigil.
 From Rodregas‚Äô perspective the next two seemed to withstand the pain a lot better than then he had.
 After all three were completed Imeralda used her magic to inscribe Jordaan.

And they wouldn‚Äôt do that.
 Because they had convicted me.
 I might have asked how the process would work, but I was too furious to pursue conversation with any kind of composure.
 And it didn‚Äôt matter, because they‚Äôd already counted me guilty.
 I was staying bound.
 I let out a frustrated growl, clenching my jaw shut.
 He was one of them.
 I had to remember that.
 I might have run back to the village right then, but they would never release me.
 I had nothing.

He ordered Chinese, and Marie came down just after it arrived.
 She saw the cartons and silently went to pour two glasses of tea.
 Rick slid his arms around her from behind.
 "I love you."
 She didn't respond, pulling away from him to carry the glasses to the table.
 With a sigh he took plates from the cabinet.
 Marie put two wontons on her plate.
 "Did I ever tell you about my wedding gown?"
 "Your mother‚Äôs?"
 "Yes.

So, on long trips in my old Toyota I listen to hymns, gospel music and such.
 As I set off on this trip, half book promotion tour and half vacation, I‚Äôm wrestling with Brother Lawrence and the question, why don‚Äôt I adore God?
 I plan to drive up the West Coast, San Diego to Seattle, and stop over with Cliff Torrey in Atascadero and Bob Williams in Portland.
 Lots of years ago, I attended a Billy Graham crusade with these two friends.
 I listened, got moved, and turned to Christ.
 Cliff made a profession but, as far as I know, never followed up.
 Bob declined the invitation.
 What sent us to the crusade began with Eric Curtis.
 As I pass the beach camp at San Onofre where Eric and I spent a couple of my happiest weeks, I silence my I-pod and remember.

The best documented example of this process is the automotive industry.
 Inspired by the idea of making a car the working-class masses at the turn of the century could afford, Henry Ford adopted new manufacturing technology, the automated assembly line, to produce the first low-priced automobile.
 Ford‚Äôs technology increased worker productivity more than seven-fold and reduced production costs by two-thirds.
 As an immediate result, thousands of small manufacturers of custom-built cars and horse-drawn carriages were put out of business.
 But the growing demand for low-cost vehicles generated explosive growth for the industry, creating tens of thousands of new jobs in the process.
 Globally, production rose from less than 250,000 vehicles in 1910 to 42 million in 1980.
 Nine decades later, the automotive industry is still the largest manufacturing industry in the world and the single largest source of jobs in the American economy.
 Every job created in automotive manufacturing has spawned roughly ten more in related occupations.
 Thus, about 9 per cent of the USA‚Äôs entire workforce is employed in occupations directly related to automotive manufacture, sales and services, road construction and maintenance, and transport of freight and passengers.
 Globally, 7 to 9 million workers were employed in automotive manufacturing in 1980 and perhaps as many as 50 to 80 million in related occupations.

I walked beside Emily as the trees passed us.
 Things seemed to watch us from the shadows and I felt like some poor little kid who was afraid to be a victim of a Halloween ‚Äújump-out-of-the-bush‚Äù scare trick.
 I shivered in silent fear.
 Emily studied me, ‚ÄúAre you cold?
 Do you need to get warmed up?‚Äù A little flame of fire flickered to life in her palm.
 I gave a shaky laugh.
 ‚ÄúNo, I'm not that kind of cold.‚Äù She put the little flame out.
 ‚ÄúAh, I know what you mean,‚Äù she said and hugged me.
 ‚ÄúI'm feeling the same way.
 But don't worry, they,‚Äù she motioned to the boys, ‚Äúdon't have to know.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey'll find out eventually,‚Äù I mumbled.

His face twisted in agony as his right arm was dislocated from its socket, leaving the limb hanging limply at the shoulder.
 I was glad I didn‚Äôt hear that sound.
 He turned back to his questioner, his mouth a grimace as the words came out, unmistakably a curse, and his other arm was wrenched from its place as well.
 He winced, apparently not yet numb from the damages, and then his face went hard, his lips pressed together, jaw clenched tight.
 He wasn‚Äôt going to scream.
 Or talk.
 His back twisted and he fell, a motionless heap on the ground.
 His body was bent out of recognition.
 It was over.
 My ears had stopped ringing the moment he‚Äôd hit the ground.

I had to protect my boys.
 In their teenage years, Brandon and Bryce were as different as perfect strangers and they were becoming young men.
 As they began to become more independent from me and from each other, they became interested in different things.
 I tried to accommodate them as individuals and stay close to them.
 I tried my damndest to embrace each son and his hobbies and desires equally.
 Bryce began to love golf, so we played golf often and eventually joined a country club so he could play as often as he liked.
 In the summer, he would spend entire days at the club, soon becoming a great golfer and playing four years on his high school team.
 He also learned what I call ‚Äúaccidental etiquette‚Äù which was my pet phrase for his learning great manners around adults as he golfed with them.
 A kind of ‚Äúwax-on wax-off‚Äù ‚ÄîKarate Kid‚Äîsubliminal learning, similar to how I learned to fight.
 Some of my fondest memories are of the days I got to watch him golf competitively.

She suspected that he'd been too upset to work.
 He'd probably sat in the garden until he'd known for sure she was gone.
 He might even still be there, hoping she hadn't gone back, that she was lost somewhere in 2011 and would eventually call out to him to come find her.
 Tears began to run down her cheeks.
 She fell asleep and dreamed that she, her parents, her brother, and Rick were at Cape Cod.
 When she awoke a couple of hours later, she felt feverish.
 Frowning, she felt her forehead.
 No .

I knew that his drawing would probably help us.
 He was the best artist I knew, his artwork was almost real.
 ‚ÄúHey guys,‚Äù Emily piped up from her paper, ‚ÄúI think we should get home and speak to our parents.
 I want to see what this dwarf was talking about when he said that everything was already arranged.‚Äù ‚ÄúI agree.‚Äù I grabbed my backpack.
 ‚ÄúWait, are we going to go?‚Äù Seth and Jason grinned at me and said together, ‚ÄúYou bet.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat is if we can find the place,‚Äù Emily reminded them.
 I turned the door knob and walked into the kitchen.
 My mom and dad were sitting in the living room looking extremely excited.
 Before I even had a chance to say hi, my mom jumped up and rushed over to me.
 ‚ÄúYou never told us that you applied for a summer camp!‚Äù my mom squealed happily.
 ‚ÄúYou also didn‚Äôt tell us that you were to be picked from the best.

He was devastated to see the condition of his property but he was strangely calm and understanding.
 He simply wanted our help to get Brandon‚Äôs belongings out of his house and fix things as best we could.
 He gave us an offer we couldn‚Äôt refuse.
 If we would get everything out by the evening and pull out all of the carpet, he would not pursue damages.
 None of us were prepared for what we saw when we turned the key in the lock and opened the door.
 Paper and cardboard blackened the windows.
 When we removed these window covers, we found broken panes behind them.
 The bedroom doors had been kicked in, and broken bongs and stem pipes, empty cigarette packs, matchbooks, just trash littered every surface.
 I don‚Äôt know what the hell these people (my son!)
 did in here, but the carpet could not have been dirtier if they raised farm animals indoors.

As I stared at the empty space where he'd been standing just a second before, I felt my chest start to constrict, and my breathing speed up.
 The sense of terror racing along my synapses was completely irrational, and extraordinarily powerful.
 Just as the room began to spin crazily around me, I felt a gentle touch on my shoulder.
 "Mistress Paige, is there anything I can get you?
 Something to eat perhaps?
 Or if you'd rather, I can show you to the theater."
 I chopped off a hysterical burst of laughter just before it managed to emerge full force and totally embarrass me.
 Of course Alec had a theater in his house.
 Probably a pool and a gym too.
 Along with a half-dozen other amenities I'd never think of, but that the ultra-rich simply couldn't do without.

The bloodshed has begun!‚Äù
 Antonil‚Äôs gaze broke.
 He ran to where the sixty elves that had lined the street engaged a large portion of his army.
 They had discarded their bows and drawn swords, wielding them with a precision his men would be blessed to ever match.
 They didn‚Äôt need to, for they had numbers, momentum, and morale.
 When Antonil shoved to the front line, they also had leadership.
 The sixty dwindled to forty before fleeing.
 ‚ÄúGive chase,‚Äù Antonil shouted.
 ‚ÄúThose in the back, flush them out of the houses.‚Äù
 Velixar watched the Neldaren army scatter, some chasing elves down streets, others barging into locked homes.

I‚Äôll keep you in suspense no longer about my conclusion.
 It is this: we are not cynical.
 We do not deny our left arms, our spiritual sides.
 I mean, the universe is vast and mysterious and difficult and harmful and loving and full of the kind of wonder that makes simple men sit on their porches at night and look at the stars.
 I believe this: there is more star-gazer to most of us than cynic.
 But I‚Äôm still left with an uneasy feeling about spirituality, religion, personal theism, ibada, vespers‚Äîcall it what you will‚Äîentering our workaday lives.
 I‚Äôm not sure I want it there, in the marketplace, in the bars, in the music.
 Perhaps, dad, it should all remain private.
 And maybe all this religiosity can be refuted by Hemingway‚Äôs wonderful closing line to The Sun Also Rises, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it pretty to think so?‚Äù  But here, in middle age, with my old friends settling down, with children growing up around me like burning bushes, I say to Papa: Yes, it is.
 It is pretty to think there are things we don‚Äôt understand.

I broke loose from the girl and hustled into the nearest classroom building and into the restroom.
 I leaned onto the sink and glared at the mirror, where my flesh appeared to peel and shred.
 I kicked the wall and howled.
 A teacher came rushing in.
 He was a large Spaniard who had given me plenty of office referrals for failing to shave or wearing a shirt with tails out.
 This time, when he ordered me to the office, I blasted him with a volley of curses that might have convinced him he should send me to an exorcist rather than to the front office.
 Then I dodged him and hustled back out to where Cliff and Billy leaned against the office wall, surrounded by tragedy groupies.
 The three of us escaped around the office building, down the front steps to the street, where we ran into Laura.
 Though in four years she would become my wife, I hardly knew her and didn‚Äôt realize yesterday was her birthday.
 She asked me to sit on the grass for a minute.

Inky darkness rose all about his feet, swirling like black floodwaters.
 Chills crept up his ankles as the liquid darkness grew.
 Velixar cried out the final words of the spell, spreading the darkness for a mile in all directions, so high it covered up to their necks.
 ‚ÄúIt is cold,‚Äù Qurrah said, his teeth chattering.
 ‚ÄúYou will not be harmed by it,‚Äù Velixar said, watching the approaching army.
 ‚ÄúWith so much hidden, they will be hard pressed to target us among my undead.
 Hold nothing back.

I answer some of the calls and ignore others as I am instructed to do by Officer White.
 I whisper in one call as if I can‚Äôt talk because I am still stuck at home with my wife and cannot talk freely.
 I reassure Ashley that I will meet her as soon as I can get out.
 I think of my wife and son at home wondering why I haven‚Äôt called; is it over?
 Am I dead?
 Finally the crew is all present behind the store, and the review of protocol and procedure began as it did before.
 New officers are in amongst familiar faces from the prior attempt.
 I find myself less interested in their chat as I mentally prepare myself for the task at hand.
 I am given the weapons and shots fired instructions again.
 In my usual humorous deflection of discomfort, I quip that the last time I met Ashley it was a ‚Äúhappy ending‚Äù and I would like the same result this time.

This is the ultimate ‚Äòrationale‚Äô behind the inevitable claim of the poor everywhere that will be made with ever-growing insistence and impatience until it is finally granted ‚Äì as the birthright of every human being ‚Äì freedom, food, education, employment, prosperity and fulfilment for all.
 Perspectives for the New Millennium
 The individual effect, complex linkages, mutually supportive interactions and consequent cumulative impact of these two revolutions and the nine other factors propelling global change are incalculable.
 They make this a rare moment in history for a quantum leap forward, which many have dreamed about but few believed achievable.
 Seizing this opportunity requires, most importantly of all, a change in awareness, attitude and perspective.
 Several ideas will be of abiding value in our endeavour to make the most of this rare moment.
 Our present problems and future potentials can only be understood when viewed from a wider historical perspective that avoids getting lost in the media-driven drama and intensity of momentary crisis and short-term trends.
 As recent global action to protect the environment amply demonstrates, public awareness and understanding are growing too rapidly and becoming too important in global affairs for us to rely on the present positions of governments or current public sentiment as gauges of what may be achieved in the near future.
 More reliable indices of what is possible are the underlying currents that are rapidly raising the value of the human being, bringing nations together in ever-closer co-operation and mutual interdependence, and pressing the international community to raise its goals.
 The world is blind to the measure of its own accomplishments.

She pushed us into the woods, ‚ÄúWe got to move fast before someone gets hurt.

 The dwarf was sitting on the edge of the slide, looking like an ugly version of a toddler, and a few more came out of the woods to join him.
 We tried to sneak up without being spotted but one of the dwarves turned his head and saw us.
 He immediately launched himself onto Emily.
 She screeched and I thought I saw one of the kids turn around.
 He crawled up to her ear and whispered something that I couldn‚Äôt hear.
 She froze, but I saw her place her hands on his wrinkled skin.
 Fire flared from her fingertips, scorching his skin.
 He let out a screech and vaulted off her, running as fast as his legs could take him.

I wasn‚Äôt as worried about the financial price at this point, but rather the thought of owing Thomas after all that he had perpetrated against us was almost as unpalatable as Brandon‚Äôs Oxy addiction.
 This was all unchartered territory.
 It was all uncomfortable.
 It all sucked big time.
 My pride would take a back seat to Brandon‚Äôs needs.
 His drug problem was more important than the grudge I was holding over my brother‚Äôs drug-induced antics.
 I felt like I was selling out.
 But somewhere in my heart I guess I had always hoped that Thomas and I would mend the damage between us.
 That one day I could forgive.
 That one day our families would spend a holiday together, and that holiday would lead to another and eventually things would be as normal as they could be.

It was amazing what the administration was letting everyone get away with.
 Of course, if I had legs like some of these girls, I'd probably be joining in.
 Britney turned down her rap music just long enough to say "Hi", and then we were off to school.
 The music was fairly hideous, but it did spare me having to try and be friendly before I was fully awake.
 Of course it also stopped me from digging further into the mystery of why it was so dangerous to hike.
 That particular question would probably have to wait at least until lunch.
 Mrs. Sorenson looked up as I walked into a nearly empty class, but I was on time, even if only barely.
 I'd heard of teachers taking an instant dislike to one of their students, but I'd never experienced it first hand until now.
 I fielded two questions on the role of phosphorus in photosynthesis before being hit with a third one I couldn't answer.
 I felt my ears go hot as the three other girls in the classroom giggled.

Mom carting me off to the middle of nowhere wasn't going to change that.
 There was a huge tree on the far edge of the yard.

 "Come on, Adri.
 Cindi's already climbed up to the second set of branches.
 You can do it, but you don't have to do it all by yourself, let me help you."
 My vision was growing blurry.
 I tried to wrench my thoughts back to safe territory, but it was too late, Dad's face was already filling up my vision.
 Cindi and I looked nothing like Mom.

The very idea of employment as opposed to livelihood is a recent conception born of the Industrial Revolution.
 In principle, every human being born creates at least the potential for his own employment, because his very birth generates demand for additional products and services and because each individual possesses the innate capacity to acquire productive skills and creative knowledge capable of generating new products and services to meet new and existing social needs.
 That is why, in spite of rapid strides in the mechanization of agriculture and mass production in manufacturing, the six-fold multiplication of human population since 1800 has been accompanied by a more or less equivalent growth of employment opportunities.
 The present job gap is small compared with the enormous expansion of the labour force.
 As people develop, their aspirations rise and higher level needs emerge ‚Äì needs for education, health care, balanced diet, entertainment, travel and communication ‚Äì multiplying demand for new workers to provide them.
 Of course, there can be and are temporary dislocations and disorientations, sometimes severe, resulting from the rapid speed of social transformation that makes existing attitudes and skills obsolescent within a lifetime or less and compels human beings to learn to adapt faster and further than ever before in human history.
 This is the challenge posed by the evolution of humanity from the physical to mental stage, the flip side of the process that has given birth to all the miraculous achievements of the past few hundred years.
 It is a challenge posed to all humanity to expand our minds and acquire more flexible attitudes, to learn and adapt faster, to convert the stress of change into the joy of higher accomplishment.
 The world that is emerging is one of unprecedented opportunity to tackle the problem of unemployment that emerged with the Industrial Revolution, the massive movement of people from the land into the cities, massive migrations from one country and continent to another in search of economic opportunities, and the lightning speed of technological development that has eradicated traditional occupations while spawning whole new types and fields of human activity.
 Thus, we are faced with the paradox: an employment problem of unprecedented dimension coupled with an opportunity of unprecedented magnitude; a problem that is not going to be eliminated any time soon by the force of market mechanisms alone, but one which can be dramatically diminished by the appropriate action of governments around the world.

Still, I would rather handle a pack of Hellhounds than The Immortal Guards.‚Äù Neither looked pleased at his logic, but both nodded.
 A few hours later it was starting to get dark as Rodregas recognized the spot and turned the wagon left for the final hard assent.
 At this point there was no trail, and common sense would have argued against the path.
 It was hard work.
 The horses had to be hand-led around rocks and trees and pulled up.
 Doi‚Äôvan and Rodregas had to manhandle the wagon around a few corners which was easier to do than it should have been, but Celestial and Hellborn strength together made short work of it.
 Then, as they finally started to level out into the small little valley of the hollow, the hair all over Rodregas‚Äô body suddenly stood up on end and his skin shivered.
 Rodregas was expecting it, but was a little shocked by the strength of his reaction.
 All those years ago he had had to struggle to feel it.
 Now he almost swayed in the currents of the magic stream of energy.

All that time with nothing to do but talk, and once you started talking to people they wanted to know things.
 Things that weren't any of their business, things you weren't ready to discuss.
 Somehow I knew Rachel wouldn't pry.
 It was like keeping so many secrets for her brother had made her especially sensitive to other people's secrets.
 Another few steps brought us to the door, and I held it open for Rachel to follow me outside.
 The intense heat felt like a physical blow.
 I could almost feel my pores open up in an effort to keep me from overheating.
 The sensory overload as my eyes tried to adjust to the unfiltered afternoon sun momentarily distracted me.
 It wasn't until I heard the other door swing shut that I realized James had followed us through, but he'd taken the door on the right instead of the one of the left that I'd been holding open for him.
 Wow, talk about a chauvinistic pig.

Cassie was waiting for me at my locker when I got there.
 "Brandon wanted me to stop by and let you know he had a few things to take care of, so he won't see you during lunch.
 You can still come sit with us if you want."
 The words were right.
 If I'd been reading them off of a page in a book, I probably would've believed them, but the way she delivered them left no doubt in my mind.
 She didn't want me at their table.
 The only reason she'd stopped by my locker was because Brandon had told her to.
 "Thanks, but I have some studying to do.
 I'd better just find a quiet corner."
 The smile I received was sickly sweet, but left me with the impression I'd just failed a test.

Both men were remarkably handsome, some of God‚Äôs finest art, I think.
 Then I remember a character from Ken Kesey‚Äôs Sometimes a Great Notion, and I realize that Kesey may have used Neal Cassady, a fellow of wild intellect and passion, and a legendary womanizer, as a prototype for his character Joe Ben.
 Only he revised, changed his life, and made Joe Ben a real hero.
 Remembering that Kesey and Cassady were friends, I look up some dates.
 Sure enough, they met while Kesey was writing that novel, two years before it came out.
 And no doubt he had read Kerouac's novels featuring Cassady, a.k.a.
 Dean Moriarty et al.
 In Sometimes a Great Notion, Joe Ben used to be, as a teen, so handsome and so enthralled by girls, he never could have stayed true to any one of them.
 But a motorcycle crash disfigured his perfect face.
 Still, his girlfriend sticks by him.

The flame surrounding the skulls flared even brighter, but beneath their tails trailed long threads of silver.
 When Qurrah looked up, he saw hundreds of the threads twisting and curling together, coiling toward a hidden presence deep within the orc army.
 Taking in a deep breath, Qurrah pooled his strength and focused on the skull taunting his brother, visualizing the thread and seeking to sever it.
 There was a pull on his chest‚Äîthe taste of copper on his tongue.
 When he opened his eyes, the skull fell to the battlements.
 The jaw snapped and rotting teeth clattered to the streets below.
 ‚ÄúYou did it!‚Äù Harruq picked up the skull, frowning at its ordinariness.
 Shrugging, he flung it toward the distant army of orcs.
 ‚ÄúNot done yet,‚Äù Qurrah said, sweat lining his face, his breathing soft and ragged.
 ‚ÄúThere‚Äôre so many.

Kojas flicked his sword down and I saw Seth flinch.
 He looked at his arm in amazement where a deep cut had sliced through his clothes.
 He pressed his fingers on his arm to stop the blood and continued to scoot towards the sword.
 Kojas stepped to the side and blocked his path.
 Seth gazed up at him and I saw his eyes blaze in hate.
 ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù he snarled.
 ‚ÄúSeth, I think you know what I want.‚Äù ‚ÄúNever!‚Äù The faery chuckled and I saw his greasy hair bounce up and down.
 ‚ÄúYou seriously think that I assumed you would walk away with me?
 Oh, I had no intention of it being this simple.‚Äù I knew what he meant, and I yanked my bow off.
 I pulled my arrow out and notched it, aiming it at Kojas‚Äô back.

The sincerity pulled me further out of my safe, numb shelter.
 Something in me wanted to confide in her, was willing to risk the pain of facing reality, but I was too far gone to be able to put what I was feeling into words.
 I shook my head again, not sure if it was a refusal or something else entirely.
 Rachel took it as the former and sat down next to me, pulling her knees up tight against her chest.
 A few seconds later I heard the howl of an after-market exhaust fed by a turbo-charged engine.
 The green Honda that came screaming through the parking lot was hardly recognizable as an Accord.
 It was approaching too quickly, but I couldn't bring myself to care.
 Besides, Rachel seemed unconcerned.
 Rachel helped me up as the car came to a screeching halt, all four tires locking up to slide it around so that the passenger side was facing us.
 The over-tinted windows smoothly slid down to reveal that James was indeed the driver, and he wasn't any happier than he'd been a few seconds earlier.

It wasn't until I was almost asleep that I realized I was hoping I¬†wouldn't¬†have one of the incredible, vivid dreams tonight.
 Alec's cameo role in my last two had apparently been sufficient to tie him inseparably to all of the special dreams, and as silly as it was, I didn't want to see Alec right now.
 Not even just in my dreams.
 Maybe there really wasn't any kind of link between him and the dreams.
 Maybe I'd have one of them tonight without him making any kind of appearance.
 I sincerely hoped not, but I'd rather not have them right now than see the disdain he'd displayed earlier in the day.
 ** The next morning played out essentially the same as the day before.
 I awoke to an empty house, and then hurried to get ready and down to the bus stop so I wouldn't be stranded if nobody else showed up to give me a ride into school.
 Brandon smiled as he pulled up and found me patiently waiting for the school bus.
 "One of these days you're going to go ahead and wait for me at your house, and then I'll know you finally trust me."

Dark, slithering words flowed from his lips, ominous in the starlight.
 As the minutes passed, the blood on the stones began to glow.
 Qurrah took up his own chant, a single phrase he was to repeat so that the spirit of Ahrqur could not flee once Velixar summoned it.
 ‚Äú _Drak thun, drak thaye, kaer vrek thal luen,_ ‚Äù he chanted.
 A part of him shivered, the words so similar to black words Master had spoken before the hyena-men had come.
 He repeated his designated phrase, feeling the magic flowing from him to encircle the body.
 ‚Äú _Kala mar, yund cthular!_ ‚Äù Velixar shrieked in a voice stronger than his frail form should have possessed.
 The call echoed throughout the night, sending wolves yipping away and night owls crashing in a squawking frenzy.
 The symbols on the body flared to a brilliant crimson.
 A sense of exaltation soared through both necromancers as Ahrqur opened his eyes and snarled.

‚ÄúBut not to worry, I keep it contained to elements and minerals, no breeding.

 I found myself reevaluating her now that I knew she was Steed‚Äôs sister.
 Chevelle noticed me watching her.
 ‚ÄúDo you mind staying with Ru‚Äî‚Äù My expression cut him off.
 ‚ÄúI have some business to take care of outside of town.

The pervasive influence of science in society requires that we bridge the gap that presently divides the sciences and humanities and evolve an educational system in which science is no longer regarded as a specialized field of study.
 Fourth, radical changes are needed in the content of school curricula at all levels to make education relevant to the real needs of the students and the development of the country.
 The society whose system of education is integrated with the social aspirations of the country will develop most rapidly.
 The system of education prevalent in most developing countries is oriented toward the outer form ‚Äì acquiring a degree or qualifying certificate ‚Äì rather than the inner content of knowledge.
 Educated unemployment is a direct result of a system that fosters obedience and rote learning rather than individual initiative and creative thinking.
 A new system of development education needs to be introduced at all levels to equip the student with an understanding of his/her society, its achievements and potentials, and the opportunities open to each individual to participate in its future growth.
 The index of its success will be the extent to which students of this curriculum seek self-employment rather than salaried jobs.
 Fifth, minimum and average educational levels should be raised in all countries.
 Two centuries ago education was a luxury of the rich and it was simply inconceivable that every member of the population in any country could receive even a minimum level of education.
 Few of the industrial nations fully meet their own present minimum standards for every citizen.

And I might've done a lot of good for other people.
 In this sorry condition, I decide that my darkest sin, the one so loathsome I should never stop grieving over it, isn't any of the wicked stuff I have thought or done.
 My darkest sin is failing to do all the thousands of good works I could have done for people.
 All because I was willful and didn't allow myself to truly love them.
 Some folks would assure me this sadness and guilt means a spiritual battle is raging.
 As I tried to enter the kingdom of God, demons escalated their assaults on my soul.
 Maybe.
 To fight off the sadness, I employ my I-pod.
 During a pause after the Hallelujah Chorus, which always reminds me of Eric gliding through the corridors of Helix High School, a revelation comes.
 My kids have taught me to love.

"Are you okay?"
 He tried to set me down, to stand me up on my feet, but I grabbed onto him as tightly as my shaking arms were able.
 "Don't leave me.
 Please don't make me go."
 I didn't realize I was crying until I tried to talk.
 It was embarrassing, but was I too worried about being sent away to care.
 Any amount of ridicule would be worthwhile if it meant being able to stay with Alec.
 He obviously still wasn't convinced though.
 "Adri, you don't understand.
 This is the only way to keep you safe.

His lips brushed over hers.
 "Your lips are red from the sun."
 "Mmm."
 Her hand slid to the nape of his neck, gently pulling his head closer.
 He kissed her again, enjoying the sweet warmth of her lips, the eagerness of her response.
 He felt her slender fingers stroking his neck, and remembering how she'd run her hands over his chest yesterday evening, he wished he'd taken off his shirt.
 Marie sighed into Rick's mouth.
 This was better than any fantasy.

I'm just having a minute to myself.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay...‚Äù I trailed off.
 Seth walked over to join us.
 ‚ÄúWe should get moving and find somewhere else to stay.
 If we stay and argue in the forest, something worse is bound to find us.‚Äù ‚ÄúRight, lead the way,‚Äù I said and pushed off the tree.
 Seth nodded and I walked beside him as he led us, once again, through the woods.
 Emily and Jason were talking quietly about something which gave us both the opportunity to talk.
 ‚ÄúYou think Kojas sent them?‚Äù I mumbled to him and pushed a branch away.
 He looked at me from the corner of his eye.
 ‚ÄúObviously, why else would they say that the 'King' would underestimate them?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou make a good point,‚Äù I said.
 ‚ÄúWhy did the syphon attack you?‚Äù I lowered my voice so only he could hear me.

The elders were a different story altogether.
 My father had given them orders to protect me and the child, and even though they followed through with them, they persisted in chattering about their concerns.
 The humans frightened them unreasonably.
 They constantly fretted, wanting to keep her, and me, from contaminating anyone else.
 I attempted to reason with them, but they turned on me.
 ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand, you never will!
 They will consume you.
 The humans will consume us all.‚Äù Their hands shook as they spat out the words.
 I didn‚Äôt argue after that.
 I wouldn‚Äôt have been allowed to leave the castle anyway.

‚ÄúNothing, I was a guard who did my duty and kept my nose out of things.
 I know little of most Immortalists other than what is common knowledge.‚Äù The four talked a bit more and then split up.
 To Rodregas‚Äô discomfort, Jordaan and Imeralda left together.
 Doi‚Äôvan trailed the others and then stepped back toward Rodregas room.
 Rodregas sagged against the bed, the wound of losing Imeralda hurting more than those of his flesh.
 ‚ÄúYou said you knew she was a Nymph,‚Äù stated Doi‚Äôvan.
 Rodregas nodded.
 He wanted sympathy, but he knew that the straight talking Doi‚Äôvan was not likely to give him any.
 ‚ÄúI know.
 It is just that, well I was hoping for some more time.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you can accept her for who she is, then your time is not over,‚Äù said Doi‚Äôvan, his voice rumbling less than usual.

Mallory's explanation was tickling the back of my mind.
 "Is that why Brandon's unbeatable?"
 "Nobody is unbeatable, but yes, that's why Brandon is such a formidable adversary.
 His gift is more prosaic than most, it's just increased strength and speed, but that makes him more than a match for most normal hybrids."
 "That's why Alec had more food than normal dropped off here then?
 Because he really doesn't think he can win?"
 Mallory pondered for several seconds, before finally shrugging.
 "That may be unduly pessimistic.
 He's detail-oriented enough that part of it's probably just an insurance policy for me in case he doesn't prevail, but there is a kernel of truth to your concern.
 Alec is an incredible fighter, but Brandon's like hasn't been seen in centuries."

"Hello, Adriana.
 I assume you'll need a ride home today?"
 It was the first time Isaac had actually spoken to me, and I was surprised at how well-spoken he was.
 His voice sounded like a superbly-tuned cello.
 I filed the information away as further evidence he wasn't really our age.
 "Yes please, Brandon can only take me home on Tuesdays and Thursdays."
 It wasn't my imagination; Isaac flinched slightly, and Rachel's smile momentarily turned plastic.
 I mentally kicked myself for having once again stepped squarely between the Capulets and Montagues.
 Isaac recovered with admirable speed, smiling as he gestured us forward.
 "Well, then, after you."

 Mimi, thanks for sticking with me long enough to get addicted and to fix some of my biology facts along the way.
 As always, Katie deserves special thanks.
 Without her, Alec and Adri's story never would have seen the light of day.
 Thanks need to be expressed to Obsidian Dawn, www.obsidiandawn.com, for brushes used in the creation of Broken's cover.
 Finally, a big thanks to the bloggers who've kindly reviewed Broken and Torn, done interviews and otherwise gone over and above by sharing their platform.

It didn‚Äôt work to bring Brandon back.
 I warned and warned, but no matter how much I warned him, he continued his journey to the dark side.
 He was over six feet tall and weighed less than 140 pounds.
 He was sickly, late to every family event and completely high when and if he showed up.
 He was a constant embarrassment at large family gatherings as he was the last to show and the first to go.
 When our Chevelle was ready for its maiden voyage, he was a no show.
 I delayed starting the car for hours, expecting he might be late, but he never showed.
 That car started for the first time since I had taught the boys to drive, and Brandon missed this moment because drugs were now more important to him than anything or anybody.
 I looked at photos of Brandon growing up and wondered if I would view them in a slideshow at his funeral.
 My marriage suffered because Lisa defended Brandon vehemently; I completely understood, because I had grown up with a similar scenario: my mother‚Äôs unwillingness to see Thomas‚Äôs problem.

He'd thought he'd been in love with Sabrina, but she'd been too demure, too clingy.
 He'd begun feeling smothered.
 Gina had talked of nothing but marriage from their fifth or sixth date until he'd broken up with her.
 She'd sobbed and told him over and over how much she loved him and begged him not to break up with her.
 A month later he'd read of her engagement to another man.
 He'd actually proposed to Kim, but once she had the ring, all she'd wanted to talk about was what pieces she was going to buy to refurnish the house and at which resorts they were going to spend their summers and how much of his money was in the bank and how much in land investments.
 He'd broken up with her six weeks after proposing.
 He'd never gotten the ring back, of course.
 He was lonely.
 Rick sighed, setting down the carton of fried rice and leaning back.

"Sorry about that.
 Would you like to listen as well?"
 My confusion earned me a chuckle.
 Alec reached over to the bedside table and picked up a remote that had more buttons on it than most laptops.
 A split second later piano music flooded the room through the myriad of speakers mounted on the ceiling.
 The piece Alec's mother was playing was incredibly beautiful, full of lilting chords of joy that seemed to stumble over each other in a cheerful effort to outdo their predecessors in greeting the audience.
 Five minutes later, she started the number over again, playing with variations on the minor notes, and Alec silenced the speakers with another click of his remote.
 "It's beautiful.
 I never realized she was so good, Alec.
 I mean, it's the most incredible thing I've ever heard."

Confidential studies by NATO in the 1960s concluded that the costs of a nuclear exchange to either party would be so great that the weapons were essentially unusable.
 No satisfactory answer has ever emerged for the question: where and under what circumstances can these weapons be deployed beneficially?
 The continued expansion of nuclear stockpiles over three decades may have added to the self-importance of the military and political leaderships, and perhaps of the general public, in states that possessed them, but there is little evidence that it ever added to national security.
 The unusability of these weapons helps to explain why predictions of rapid spread of these weapons to other states proved to be so wildly exaggerated.
 The irrelevance or unusability of nuclear weapons is evident in all the wars involving major powers during the past four decades.
 A greater understanding of the environmental impact of these weapons has further strengthened the perception of unusability.
 It is time that psychological posturing gave way to a mature recognition that these weapons have no place in the civilized world and must be banished from it.
 The continued build-up of nuclear arsenals was an attempt by the superpowers to maintain parity or superiority over each other as a deterrent against being attacked.
 Although the nuclear powers may argue that their arsenals have protected them from any such danger, there is little rationality in a strategy that compelled adversaries continuously to take steps to offset each other‚Äôs measures, without either party actually achieving greater real security.
 In addition, this strategy was pursued at the cost of increasing insecurity to other nations.

 The following night, Harruq slipped out into the street.

I already knew a school this size wouldn't have anything truly interesting.
 I'd never been willing to dedicate the time required to learn a musical instrument.
 I've always been passable at drawing scenery, but anything more complicated than a stick figure gives me fits, so art was out too.
 Unless possibly the teacher liked Neolithic cave drawings.
 By the time I surfaced from my musings, Mrs. Pendely had printed my schedule out on an ancient piece of machinery, handed me a map of the school and a locker assignment, and then dashed off a handwritten note to my first teacher.
 I somehow found my first class before the bell rang.
 Mrs. Sorenson, my biology teacher, was a skinny old woman with curly white hair that looked like Greek paintings of Medusa.
 She made me introduce myself to the class and then let me slink over to my assigned seat.
 I left the class even more depressed than I'd been when I woke up.
 I'd kind of known I'd have an incredible amount of material to catch up on from the first part of the semester.

Chevelle drew a section of moss from one of the stones on the wall and it replaced the pebble.
 ‚ÄúTry this.
 They shouldn‚Äôt have bothered binding you from growing.‚Äù I concentrated on it.
 Nothing.
 But I was never good at that anyway.
 I shook my head.
 He nodded, giving up, but our hands still lay together, connecting us.
 ‚ÄúWhere are they?‚Äù I asked.
 He‚Äôd been looking at our hands, but his eyes returned to my face at the question.

I had to catch that line of thought before it spiraled out of control; I concentrated on finding something small.
 A tiny pebble lay on the ground at my feet.
 I focused on it hard, willing it to rise.
 When nothing happened I looked for Chevelle‚Äôs reaction.
 He watched me, his serene mask back in place.
 ‚ÄúDo you need motivation?‚Äù I was afraid of the kind of motivation he‚Äôd provide, remembering the fireballs flying at me in the meadow.
 ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù My answer was too quick, and he laughed.
 I knelt closer to the gray rock.
 I thought it moved a little, as if trembling in fright, and the notion had me shaking my head.
 Chevelle stood.

 He spread his hands wide and let all of his power flow freely.
 A swirling black portal ripped into existence behind him, a bleak wind wailing from it.
 Out came his undead, marching in rows of ten.
 More than a hundred rows spilled out, surrounding their master with mindless perfection.
 ‚ÄúFind him,‚Äù he ordered as he covered his face with his hood.
 ‚ÄúHe is wounded.
 Find him and kill him.‚Äù
 As one, the thousand moaned their acknowledgment.

She'd tried to push him away, and her lips had been bleeding.
 Marie frowned.
 He always apologized for shouting at her, but that hadn't stopped him from shouting at her again.
 He'd apologized for hurting her arm, but that hadn't stopped him from hurting her with his kiss.
 Would her life with him be like that?
 A series of angry words or painful grasps or bruising kisses followed by apologies?
 She was still wrestling with that question when she realized that the fog had lifted and she was still in 2011.
 Dejected, she went back to Rick.
 "It didn't work."
 He stood up, taking her hands.

An international team of experts visiting India in 1963 projected a mere 10 per cent growth in foodgrain production by 1970, whereas growth actually achieved during this period was 50 per cent.
 Neither technological, nor financial nor natural resources pose insurmountable obstacles to achieving dramatically more over the next 15 years than is indicated by past trends or current projections.
 The idea that hunger cannot be conquered because we are running out of land to support rapidly burgeoning populations is contradicted by the facts.
 Globally, there is no correlation between population density and hunger.
 China, with only half as much arable land per capita as India, produces 13 per cent more foodgrains per capita.
 Taiwan and South Korea have only half the farmland per capita of Bangladesh, yet they produce 40 per cent more food per capita.
 Tiny Netherlands, with the highest population density in the world, produces more than sufficient food to feed itself and remain a large net food exporter.
 Currently 11 per cent of the world‚Äôs land surface is used for agricultural crops, just 4 per cent more than in 1960.
 A comprehensive theoretical study of soils, climate, vegetation and topography conducted in 1975 indicated that both land and water utilized for agriculture could be doubled, if necessary, and that the earth could support 36 times the 1975 level (18 times the 1990 level) of cereal production using the same share of cultivated land.
 There would be severe practical obstacles to such a vast expansion of croplands, but these findings suggest that physical limitations to food production are not the primary constraints.

Chills crept up his ankles as the liquid darkness grew.
 Velixar cried out the final words of the spell, spreading the darkness for a mile in all directions, so high it covered up to their necks.
 ‚ÄúIt is cold,‚Äù Qurrah said, his teeth chattering.
 ‚ÄúYou will not be harmed by it,‚Äù Velixar said, watching the approaching army.
 ‚ÄúWith so much hidden, they will be hard pressed to target us among my undead.

A few were known to use sigils that improved memory or allowed one to store excess magic.
 After the sensation faded Rodregas felt no different than before.
 Rodregas had the feeling that Jordaan would have liked to keep the little frog; it was a powerful tool in the hands of an Elemental Healer like Jordaan, but Rodregas was not willing to give it up, and Jordaan never actually asked.
 The next morning they headed out for the Cathedral of Oravue.
 CHAPTER 13 A CHALLENGING PAST
 When they arrived at the Cathedral eight days later it was late in the afternoon.
 They had to hustle through the town of Oravue to reach it in time to register for the upcoming melee.
 Oravue was a good sized city, with paved roads winding up and down the sides of the hill that the town was built on.
 The whole town was dominated by the fortress like Cathedral in the middle of town.
 While the Cathedral was one of the most impressive fortresses in the known world, the town, in contrast was without walls or visible defenses of any kind, unless you counted all the winding stairs and streets that quickly got the three companions lost several times on their way to the Cathedral of the Heavens.

The prevailing opinion among the popular girls off to the left was that I was the biggest slut ever.
 The equally vindictive but more scholastically minded group in front of us was convinced I was just playing with Alec in an attempt to make Brandon jealous.
 It was all so far off that part of me wanted to laugh.
 I couldn't care less if Brandon was jealous, and Alec hadn't even kissed me yet.
 Even so, hearing my name said with such disdain by so many different people took its toll over the course of the class, and before long I was once again fighting the urge to break down and cry.
 Luckily by the end of the class, Mr. Whethers had become so frustrated with the complete lack of attention being paid him by the gossipers, he'd actually started writing them up for detention.
 As class finally ended, James cracked one of the first smiles I'd ever seen grace his face.
 "Wow.
 I never would've thought anyone could push old Whethers so far.
 He just set a school record for the most detentions assigned in a single class."

‚ÄúI had to Seth; it was heading for my house.
 That made me panic a bit.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care Jazell; if I hadn‚Äôt been here I would have found you shredded to small pieces.
 All you had to do was send me a quick text and I would have showed up to help.
 But you didn‚Äôt.‚Äù I sighed in annoyance, not in the mood for this right now.
 Seth was like this sometimes, strict and serious, but he was normally a jokester.
 He‚Äôs strict on the fact that we attack in groups, mostly for the reason that he didn‚Äôt want anything to happen to our group.
 I started to slowly limp back to my body but Seth just disappeared from my side.
 He has this annoying skill to be able to just return to his body without having to be near it, which wasn‚Äôt fair when he wasn‚Äôt the one injured.
 I, however, had to stiffly make my way to my dormant human body.
 Once I was near it, I closed my eyes and the wind picked back up.

We continued until I became winded, then Chevelle lowered his blade, smiling with approval.
 Our audience commented on the show, and I glanced around to see it was evening already, the sun beginning to set.
 How long have we sparred?
 I could feel the ache in my arms now.
 The sword hung limp at my side.
 Ruby took it from my hand.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get you fitted with a sheath.‚Äù I stood there, facing Chevelle, breathless but grinning.
 He was smiling appreciatively.
 I realized we were still being watched and sheepishly turned from him to join the group as they prepared a fire for dinner.
 The evening was filled with stories and laughter.

"Cute dress."
 Marie glanced down at her dress before responding with a puzzled, "Thank you."
 She knew it definitely wasn't in fashion now.
 A little while later Marie took the jeans and several blouses into the dressing room, removing her dress and putting on her favorite of the blouses, a navy blue one with red stripes.
 It was so soft!
 After admiring it in the mirror for a moment, she reached for the smaller pair of trousers.
 The material felt comfortable, but they were so tight!
 Were they supposed to be this tight?
 Rick would know.
 She felt queer walking out in these clothes, but after having seen how women of this decade dressed, she knew she'd draw more attention in her Egyptian-motif dress than in this outfit.

 In the distance, he spotted a small fire, and he knew to whom it belonged.

 ‚ÄúHe has abandoned me,‚Äù Qurrah said, pulling at his robes.
 He glanced back to the town, hoping to change the topic.

 ‚ÄúThere are bodies nearby,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúHundreds.

 The alley opened up to the main street, running south from the center of town into the forest beyond.
 It was there that the bulk of combat had spread.
 Elves battled in the street, horribly outnumbered.
 They were skilled, though, and a steady stream of arrows from homes continued to weaken the human forces.
 ‚ÄúHalt here,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 To their right was a two-story elven home.
 Three bowmen fired from the windows at a party of fifteen soldiers.
 The men of Neldar had their shields raised high, but the synergy between the elves in the home and the elves on the street was superb.

You are beautiful."
 I waited for the inevitable joke, or backhanded compliment to follow, but he seemed happy to just stop there.
 For once in my life I managed to be smart and do the same.
 "So what's the agenda for today?"
 Alec stretched and then shrugged.
 "School, just like every Monday."
 My groan brought a smile to his face.
 "I can ship pesky parents out of the country, but if you start a wholesale program of cutting class your mom will find out when she gets back."
 "So I just go about my day like normal, pretending like I don't know Brandon's a psychopath who just happens to be able to change shapes at will and rip big holes in brick walls?"
 I finally rolled out of bed, and started picking through the pile of bags from our shopping trip, hoping to find something that wouldn't make it look like I'd just won the lottery or robbed a bank.

What if Velixar ordered otherwise, or someone close to Aurelia struck against Qurrah?
 He sighed.
 In his heart, he knew he could never again strike at Aurelia, regardless of what anyone else wanted of him.
 The look on her face when he had stabbed her, that combination of sadness and shock, would haunt him forever.
 ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù he said.
 ‚ÄúI promise.

It permits each country to specialize in industries where it possesses a ‚Äòcomparative advantage‚Äô.
 This specialization enables it to evolve improved processes to achieve higher levels of quality and productivity, larger production volumes and lower costs.
 This results in higher incomes for its workers and makes their products more affordable in other countries, which in turn raises standards of living abroad.
 The resultant rise in real incomes domestically and overseas stimulates demand for more of these products as well as for other products that can be produced locally or imported from overseas.
 Trade also tends to raise the quality of jobs in an economy.
 It forces higher-wage countries and their workers to specialize in technology-intensive and skill-intensive occupations that pay higher wages.
 At the same time, it also raises the wages of less-skilled jobs in low-wage countries by increasing the demand for workers to produce for overseas markets.
 The problem in the more developed countries is that the demand for low-skilled jobs declines and the gap in wages between skilled and unskilled jobs tends to increase, resulting in a decline in incomes and employment opportunities for lower levels of the population in these countries.
 This is a natural, healthy process of social development in which different sectors serve as engines for growth at different stages.
 The upward job displacement that earlier shifted job opportunities from agriculture to industry now shifts them to higher-skilled jobs in manufacturing and services.

 "I don't think she will.
 Not after the rest of the class realizes she has a hard time reading the book herself.
 Even if she does, it doesn't really matter.
 I never expected to finish junior high, let alone graduate from high school.
 Besides, James is always talking about dropping out and just getting his GED.
 Maybe I'll follow suit."
 She stiffened slightly as I hugged her, but then smiled and returned the gesture with an earnestness that made me think she hadn't had much in the way of hugs in her life.
 "Well, I hope it doesn't come to that, but thanks again.
 I may still flunk out, but seeing the expression on her face makes it worthwhile."

My wife and I put him on the speaker phone when he calls so we can both share his day with him.
 He has no car so he walks about one mile back on the shoulder of the narrow country road in Werner Springs as he talks to us.
 You can hear the crunching sound of the road‚Äôs gravel beneath his feet and imagine the gait of his walk from the delay between the sounds.
 The need for material objects is no longer what he desires and either are the drugs he once craved.
 We are touched by his compassion, his love and his maturity.
 We look forward to his call nightly and when we hear sirens, we feel sorrow for the parents whose visions are what ours once were.
 Our entire family welcomes our son back and we all realize that no matter how helpless a situation like drug addiction seems we now know that there is help, professional help.
 Most importantly, there is hope where there is love and there is love where there is family.
 Within any family and throughout the generations there will be many moments that define you as a person.
 If you are a father or a mother now, there was a day when you were a son or a daughter.

Still, even this late, one wishes, with the advent of the compact disc revolution, that it would be reissued.
 But now, Buddy wanted to be Hendrix, Clapton, Erik Brann, Zappa.

1.Promote small businesses: All the publicity given to the impact of down-sizing by major corporations has obscured the fact that the top 500 US firms employ less than five per cent of the US workforce.
 It is also the smaller firms that are responsible for job growth.
 Businesses employing fewer than 20 workers presently account for 57 per cent of new job creation in Europe.
 Based upon the successful examples of many developing countries that have stimulated growth in this sector, there is vast scope for expanding services to support new enterprises through better access to management and employee training courses, credit and R & D facilities; by testing and certification for those who want to start businesses; and by estab lishing business incubators to provide work space and shared services as well as technical, financial and marketing expertise to start-up companies.
 2.Reduce business failures: New businesses create most of the jobs, but they destroy most of them too, by going out of business.
 The failure rate of new businesses is extremely high in most industrial nations.
 In Italy, roughly 50 per cent fail in the first year.
 Of the more than 600,000 new business start-ups in the United States each year, 40 per cent close within 12 months, 80 per cent within five years, and 80 per cent of the remainder in the subsequent five years.
 Expanding programmes for management training, small business education and counselling, marketing assistance and financial management can bring down the failure rate dramatically.
 3.Voluntary part-timism: Increasing the flexibility of working hours will serve the interests of both businesses and workers.

When it died down, we found you lying on the ground unconscious.
 That‚Äôs basically it.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know what the light was.‚Äù Emily added.
 ‚ÄúBut whatever it was, it saved your life.‚Äù ‚ÄúUh I have a feeling I should thank it, but I don‚Äôt know how you thank light.‚Äù I muttered.
 ‚ÄúYou thank it like you would thank anyone else,‚Äù A voice said.
 I almost jumped to the moon in surprise.
 Out of nowhere someone, or something, appeared beside Jason.
 I think Jason was more scared because he actually jumped into the air.
 As it came into view, it became obvious that it was a girl.
 She in a yellow cloak and had dazzling red hair.
 She smiled warmly at us with her chocolate brown eyes and I realized she had pointed ears.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be waiting.‚Äù As I turned to go, I realized I hadn‚Äôt asked any of the important questions that had been nagging me.
 I‚Äôd have to try harder tomorrow, stay on task.
 I ran back to the castle at full speed.
 Ruby cleared her throat and I shoved the book into my pack.
 I glanced over at her but she was still facing out the window.
 A moment later Chevelle walked in and she threw him a wicked grin, leaving us alone.
 I brushed the length of my hair forward, hoping to cover the heat that had risen to burn my neck and ears.
 ‚ÄúReady to resume training?‚Äù he asked.
 That cooled the flush and I grimaced, moving to stand.
 I hadn‚Äôt done so since the incident and my head spun.

‚ÄúNow,‚Äù he said and quickly repeated in his deep but smooth voice, ‚ÄúNOW!‚Äù Captain Poir, the leader of Ravenhurr‚Äôs guards, had stepped out of the shadows and approached the prisoners, but Rodregas stepped forward first and grabbed the half AElf maiden‚Äôs arm.
 With a quick twist of the key he removed her iron shackles but grabbed her arm hard so she could not run.
 ‚ÄúThis way,‚Äù Rodregas said to her.
 As he separated her from the male prisoner he whispered to her, ‚ÄúIf you want to live, don‚Äôt do anything until your circle starts to burn, then I will throw the club at the other guard.
 Run and make sure you get out of the circle.‚Äù She jerked towards him as he spoke and Rodregas was struck once again by the beauty of her amazing eyes, but he forced her forward hoping that she could think on her feet.
 Rodregas carefully led her over the outer white circle and into a yellow circle that was across from the Celestial Lion.
 Captain Poir led the man into the pale green circle that was the closest to being in the exact middle and was most strongly interconnected to the other circles.
 As Rodregas crossed into the main circle, the sense of power almost made him stumble.
 He knew his own power was minimal, not much above average, but his few years of training as a boy had opened him up to magic more than the other three guards on the tower roof.
 Rodregas knew that if Ravenhurr had ever thought he had more than basic magic training he would long have been reassigned to a duty far from the ceremony.

Mom, we never knew how hard life was for you because you made sure we came first and you protected us the best you could!
 To my son Bryce, I would like to thank you for all of your accomplishments and helping me as a father not have a complete melt down because at least I knew I wasn‚Äôt a complete failure as a Dad.
 You gave me the hope and courage to continue to try to understand your brother and his drug addiction and eventually the addiction of others.
 And a special Thank You to my editor, Robin Martin of Two Songbirds Press, for believing in my story and my ability to convey it.
 I couldn‚Äôt have completed this without you!
 Part I: Defining Moments Chapter 1: The Medicine Cabinet I sit alone in my new quad truck with its 22-inch rims; it looks like some 20-year-old spoiled brat has decked it out.
 I am tucked away in a remote parking space at a retail shopping center.
 No one would normally park this far from the grocery store, which anchors an array of businesses, at least not this late at night in this sparsely populated lot.
 I know this place well, as this is where my wife and I buy our groceries.
 It is in an upper class neighborhood serving the wealthy residents who live in their posh homes nearby.

The linoleum floor was faded, but still relatively clean, and the white paint on the walls was conspicuously free of tags and gang signs.
 The students even seemed to be mingling fairly easily with each other.
 I actually kind of missed the feel of armed camps.
 My school hadn't been bad compared to some stories I'd heard from California, but there'd still been some kids beaten pretty severely for crossing the wrong group of wannabe gang members.
 Britney had a piece of pizza, and looked like she was eyeing a piece of cake until she noticed I was trailing along behind her without a tray of my own.
 She actually sighed as she passed the cake.
 The urge to giggle was so strong I uncapped my water bottle and turned slightly to the side in an attempt to disguise my amusement.
 It was one of those moments I'd try to reconstruct in my head again and again.
 I think I must have heard the cash register till close, or maybe Britney said something.
 Whatever the reason, I took a step in her direction while still looking away, my bottle half raised, and ran into the biggest junior I'd ever seen.

In an effort to cover my embarrassment, I turned back to Rachel and James, only to feel my jaw figuratively hit the ground.
 James was standing between Rachel and Brandon, slightly crouched in a posture that looked strangely familiar.
 I heard footsteps to my left as Brandon finished crossing the last few feet between us.
 James backed up a half step, one arm stretched out behind him, pushing Rachel back.
 I suddenly realized why his movements seemed so familiar.
 I'd seen dozens of celebrities being shepherded out of one award show or another by professional bodyguards who acted exactly like James was acting right now.
 Only they usually weren't so obvious about it.
 The only time I'd ever seen a bodyguard physically push their client around was when some up-and-coming soap star had a bottle thrown at her by the wife of someone she was sleeping with.
 I looked past Brandon, expecting to see something threatening headed towards us.
 I even opened my mouth to warn Brandon, but there wasn't anything there, just Brandon, still with the same casual smile as he reached out and squeezed my arm.

In Ghana, for instance, the cost of fertilizer as a percentage of total cultivation cost has risen ten-fold in recent years.
 The impact of macro-economic reforms on agriculture has been most severe in the countries of Eastern and Central Europe, where production in this sector has fallen drastically over the past few years.
 Technology
 Slower growth in productivity can be attributed to a slowdown in the development of improved hybrid varieties, shortages of quality seeds and fertilizers, and the absence of techno-infrastructure facilities needed for storage and processing, expansion of markets, transport and distribution.
 Environment
 A number of factors are posing serious obstacles to productivity growth and threaten even current levels of production.
 Of the poor, 80 per cent in Latin America, 60 per cent in Asia and 50 per cent in Africa live on marginal land of low productivity and high susceptibility to environmental degradation.
 Raising productivity on these lands can be extremely difficult.
 Quality farmlands are being lost at an astonishing rate to diversion for non-farm uses, desertification, deforestation, soil erosion, and the depletion and pollution of water resources.
 These factors have resulted in the degradation of nearly one billion hectares worldwide since the Second World War.

When the representative nature of a national government is in question, its claim to sovereignty over its own people under all circumstances is also questionable.
 Hitherto, it has not been possible to address this issue forth rightly, because the evolution of the international community had not yet come to accept in practice, as opposed to merely in principle, the fundamental human rights so frequently espoused in constitutions and ignored in actions.
 This situation has changed, especially after humanity‚Äôs bitter experiments with totalitarian regimes during this century.
 It is now recognized that the democratic principles of political freedom, social equality, self-determination and related human rights are inalienable and must be extended to all people everywhere.
 The second factor that naturally imposes limits on national sovereignty ‚Äì the rights of other nations and their citizens ‚Äì has also gained substantially wider acceptance, has been enshrined by international law, and has become accepted doctrine governing many facets of international relations.
 Common security against transnational threats and common prosperity for all humankind cannot be based on a 250-year-old concept of nation sovereignty.
 Over the last half century, national sovereignty has been maturing into international sovereignty.
 As the evolution of the international community proceeds towards the establishment of an effective system of world governance in one form or another, the collective rights of the international community of nations must inevitably come to be regarded as another inalienable truth, alongside individual human rights and the rights of each nation.
 The right of the nation state to self-determination has to accommodate the rights of other nations and the common shared rights of every human being.
 This approach establishes criteria for determining when claims of national sovereignty must be ignored.

Campfires and torches.
 An army, the same that had removed him and his brother from their home, slept so close.
 Every one of them contemplated their death.
 Qurrah closed his eyes and inhaled the cold night air.
 Yes, the tension was delectable.
 The quiet moments before battle were a rare thing that so very few were lucky enough to experience.
 Fear, worry, hope, prayer, regret, and sorrow all floated to the stars.
 The half-orc let his attuned mind drink it all in.
 Beautiful, he thought.
 Absolutely beautiful.

First she had it, then she didn't, now she did again.
 None of it made sense, but she seemed perfectly ready to accept everything at face value.
 Maybe her way was the best.
 I certainly envied her.
 Not the not knowing, but the fact that she didn't have to worry about what it all meant.
 How did I get stuck being the parent, while she got to be the kid?
 Who'd be interested in helping us?
 No, that wasn't the right question.
 The key to figuring this all out was to decide who could've helped us out.
 Nobody we'd known back in Minnesota could've strong-armed both the president of a bank and the mayor.

 "She isn't my Kim--not any more."
 It had been over a year since they'd broken up.
 "Yeah.
 So I thought maybe she could be my Kim.
 I ran into her at lunch downtown, and I invited her out for drinks that evening.
 She's good, Rick.
 It was the first time I'd been alone with her--you know, without you and my own date--and it took her less than ten minutes to figure out that I'm not exactly the marrying type.
 I still don't know how I gave myself away.
 It was a first."

If Brandon's people do show up, it'll likely take all three of us to get you away safely."
 "So you don't mind?
 You'll stay here and talk to me?"
 Alec paused for several seconds, which wasn't promising.
 Then again, he hadn't released my shoulders yet, so maybe there was still some hope.
 "I'm not sure that's the best idea.
 You really need your sleep.
 The whole purpose of this little exercise is to convince your mom you've been safely home this entire time.
 If you crash later in the day, she's going to know you didn't sleep tonight."
 "Maybe if you stayed with me it would help me sleep."

His eyes grew big as he stared at her.
 The jeans revealed slender thighs, smoothly rounded hips, and, as she turned just a bit, a perfectly shaped little derriere.
 He started to reply to her question but found he had to clear his throat before he could speak.
 "You look great."
 "Really?
 Are they supposed to be this tight?"
 "That's-that's the style."
 "And this is considered comfortable?
 I don't know if I can even sit down with them on!"
 With regret he put his own wishes aside.

My grandfather was a very volatile person, a hateful man, and he clashed with his son‚Äîmy Uncle Dan‚Äîoften.
 They physically fought, and my uncle was no match for his father.
 My grandfather, a retired oil driller from Oklahoma and Kansas, drank a lot.
 His skin was Indian-dark, and the wrinkles on his face were deep.
 My brother and I would hide when they fought, and my mother would hold us if she was there, placing her hands over our ears and cradling us close to her.
 Her body muffled the sounds.
 She would rock slightly while humming or singing quietly so we would drift off to anyplace but there.
 We stayed because we had no place else to go, just as my uncle and my grandmother did.
 My grandmother was a stark contrast to my grandfather.
 She always had a bright smile and she treated us with an abundance of love.

She wasn't on the bus, and she apparently hadn't come with her brother, so she wasn't coming.
 I knew I should reserve judgment until I'd given her a chance to explain what'd happened, but it was hard to remember that when faced with Alec's air of superiority.
 Rachel was nicer, but she was still a Graves.
 Maybe this was just a sign of things to come.
 Apparently I wasn't the only one put off by Alec's snobbishness.
 A couple of guys who looked like they were old enough to be in college were rolling their eyes at him.
 They were whispering and laughing, but positioned as they were closer to Alec than to me, I couldn't make out any of what they were saying.
 While I agreed completely with their sentiment, they were so loud they were disturbing at least twenty or thirty people.
 Hopefully they'd quiet down once the actual show started up.
 Judging by the orchestra, it was almost time.

 ‚ÄúIt is time I met your brother,‚Äù Velixar said as the clouds rolled above, obscuring the waning moon.
 He had trained with Qurrah for almost two months, and over that time the half-orc had grown greatly in power.
 ‚ÄúKing Vaelor‚Äôs nightmares have never been stronger, and he will act upon them soon.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI am not sure Harruq is ready,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 ‚ÄúIt is difficult enough bringing me here.

‚ÄúAt last!‚Äù Felewen cried, staring out from a side alley.
 They were behind a group of ten soldiers battling a pair of elven warriors who stood back to back.
 ‚ÄúMake haste, they need us!‚Äù
 Felewen charged, desperate to arrive before her brethren were overwhelmed.
 Aurelia stepped into the street and summoned her magic.
 Frost surrounded her hands, and a thin sheet of ice spread beneath the human soldiers.
 Many of them stumbled, unable to balance the sword and shield in their hands and the heavy chainmail on their bodies.
 Felewen slid on one leg, her sword out and ready.
 She passed right between two men, slicing out heels and tendons as she flew by.
 The elf reached the end of the ice, turned, and went sliding back.

Harruq closed his eyes and listened as he tried to slow his pulse.
 He had no clue who this Aurelia was, but if she wanted to intervene he was glad to let her.

 Harruq coughed at this.
 The woman saving him was an elf?
 Had the world turned upside down?
 ‚ÄúOh really?‚Äù Aurelia said.
 ‚ÄúHow sad.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWe said go, now, or else.‚Äù

I removed one of my arrows and put my bow on the ground.
 I walked over to Seth and pulled his sword out of its sheath.
 He grabbed for it but I already had it in my hands.
 I put the tip against the arrow and carved the same sign as the one on the wall.
 Then I tossed Seth's sword back at him, which he caught without a problem, and picked up my bow.
 I notched the carved arrow and released it.
 It whizzed up and out of sight.
 ‚ÄúThere, now they'll know how to find us.‚Äù Seth whistled.
 ‚ÄúThat's a good idea.‚Äù He gripped his sword and walked through the tunnel.

And Skippy and Crafty‚Äîlater re-christened Castor and Pollux‚Äîcreated a bottom like a sheol torture chamber, like Thor and Loki at war.
 The crash and thunder coming out of that old Sinclair station was music from the beginning of time, the music the apes heard which made them men.
 Music, soul-deep.
 Collective unconscious-deep.
 They cohered, they veered away and came back, like the trajectory of stars.
 Buddy‚Äôs solos were like fluid silver; he was re-inventing the electric guitar.
 It was around this time that Buddy began writing songs.
 He was shy about it.
 No one knows how many he wrote before he brought the first one to the group, the one that would later be their most requested song, ‚ÄúI Love my Aunt Jemima.‚Äù  Soon, though, he was bringing in songs in coacervations, as if he had eons of them bubbling up.
 That first acceptance by the group opened the floodgates and Buddy Gardner became something of a songwriting machine.

 I was surprised just how satisfying it was.
 Maybe I should become a teacher.
 Rachel caught my eye before I made it back to my table.
 She gave me another tentative smile as I slid into the seat next to her.
 "I'm really sorry about yesterday.
 I said all of the wrong things.
 It's just I'm not supposed to talk about what Alec says."
 Wow, he sounded like even more of a jerk than I'd expected.

Recently, international and bilateral financial institutions have promoted the market as the most effective instrument for managing agriculture throughout the world.
 This view leaves two questions unanswered.
 First, if the market is so effective, why is it that every major capitalist economy utilizes such a vast array of subsidies, incentives, controls, production quotas and fixed pricing mechanisms to govern production and trade in agricultural products?
 Even after GATT, protection for this sector by industrial nations will remain high.
 Second, granted that the market works effectively for mature capitalist societies with high levels of technology, education, productivity, living standards and food surpluses, and relatively small portions of the workforce dependent on agriculture, is the same necessarily true for countries at an earlier stage of development, in which (1) a majority of the workforce is dependent on agriculture for sustenance, (2) levels of education, productivity and incomes are low, and (3) any increase in food prices can have a devastating impact on food consumption levels in the country?
 The answers to these questions are relevant both to the countries presently making the transition from centrally planned to market economies in Eastern Europe and to poorer developing countries striving to achieve food security.
 Nations accord special status to their agricultural sector for several reasons.
 Continuous supplies of food are absolutely essential to the welfare of the population.
 Food prices are extremely sensitive to changes in the supply of foodstuffs.
 Even a small increase or decrease in supply can lead to a very wide fluctuation in prices.

Until tomorrow.
 At twelve Buddy had graduated to electric guitar, a gift from his father, Al Gardner, who had played clarinet with a dance band called Dick Delisi and the Syncopators, at the Vapors Supper Club in his own mis-spent youth.
 Buddy‚Äôs mother, Elise, could only pull at her hair and clap dishpan hands over her ears when the noise emanating from Buddy‚Äôs room began.
 To her it sounded like the can-opener on warp speed.
 Buddy drew from everywhere, listening with equal fervor to Woody Guthrie, Odetta, Hoagy Carmichael, Django Reinhardt, Coleman Hawkins, Bill Haley, Lonnie Donegan, Howlin Wolf, Eric Dolphy, Skip James, Shostakovich.
 Music fed Buddy the way most of us grew up on oatmeal and peanut butter.
 And he absorbed it all, filtering it through his sensitive system to come out his delicate fingertips as liquid electricity, a sound even today many guitarists cannot duplicate and few can even explain.
 By thirteen he had his own band, made up of less-skilled classmates at Snowden Elementary.
 They called themselves Regulation Footwear and soon were playing gigs at high school dances and other social occasions, at Clearpool, even at an end-of-school year rally at the Overton Park Shell, foreshadowing later triumphs.
 Clearly, it was Buddy people came to see, Buddy who garnered them engagements with older audiences.

 That didn't sound like Alec at all.
 "Are you sure, Mom?
 They didn't arrange anything you could use to verify they're for real?"
 I suddenly realized why parents got such a big kick out of catching their kids doing something wrong.
 Mom looked so sheepish I almost laughed.
 "Well, he did say he'd arrange for an immediate advance to be wired over to our bank, but it's closed on Saturdays, and it isn't like I can go calling up the bank president for something trivial like that."
 I opened my mouth, still unsure what to say in response to her latest excuse, only to be interrupted by her cell phone again.
 "Yes, this is she.

Mrs. Sorenson shot me a nasty look as I stumbled into class.
 "Well isn't it nice of you to come to class today.
 And here we all thought you were doing so well you didn't need to bother with the test."
 I took the proffered test and made my unsteady way back to my desk.
 The class passed in a blur as I made a half-hearted attempt to focus on the questions and remember all kinds of facts about photosynthesis that I'd known just a few days before.
 It was useless.
 The separate pieces of information skittered about on the edge of my memory without ever becoming tangible enough to relate to the answer I needed.
 By the time class ended, I'd almost completely shut down.
 I registered the whispers as I made my way to English.
 I normally would've been mad, or possibly embarrassed, but it was like my feelings were wrapped in layers of cotton candy.

I summoned our armies, as did the priests of Ashhur.
 Think now of the many deformed creatures that walk this world.
 Know they were all mere animals before the gods turned them into soldiers for their war.
 The elves were vicious in this time, slaying any who dared come near their forests.
 But some elves did side with Karak, determined to help end the war so the world could heal.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúDid Celestia not interfere?‚Äù Qurrah asked.
 In the darkness, Qurrah watched as Velixar‚Äôs face curled into a deep snarl.
 ‚ÄúCelestia befriended both brothers, but she took Ashhur to be her lover.
 She begged each to stop, though neither listened.
 It was a dark time, Qurrah.

 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.
 I was sold,‚Äù he said, his face visibly darkening.
 ‚ÄúTo whom?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI was never given his name,‚Äù Qurrah said.
 His voice, already soft and quiet, grew even quieter.
 ‚ÄúHe was Master.

‚ÄúHarruq, they flee west,‚Äù Qurrah whispered, magically enhancing his voice using a spell Velixar had taught him.
 His quiet words flooded the town, audible by all yet still sounding like a whisper.
 The fleeing residents of the town heard and were terrified.
 His brother heard and obeyed.
 The two met at the edge of town.
 They saw scattered groups of families not far in the distance.
 ‚ÄúGet them, my brother,‚Äù Qurrah ordered.
 ‚ÄúNone may live or they will tell of the half-orcs who destroyed their town.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúThen they‚Äôre dead,‚Äù Harruq said, clanging his swords together.
 Power crackled through them.

"Are you okay?"
 He tried to set me down, to stand me up on my feet, but I grabbed onto him as tightly as my shaking arms were able.
 "Don't leave me.
 Please don't make me go."
 I didn't realize I was crying until I tried to talk.
 It was embarrassing, but was I too worried about being sent away to care.
 Any amount of ridicule would be worthwhile if it meant being able to stay with Alec.
 He obviously still wasn't convinced though.
 "Adri, you don't understand.
 This is the only way to keep you safe.

Apparently she's a lot tougher than a normal wolf should be, and she's just crazy enough to fight to the death over something that the other two don't think is really all that important.
 Jessica is pretty much the most submissive, not by temperament, but because she's the weakest fighter we've got."
 I felt my eyes go wide at all the new terms, but kept my mouth shut because I was worried Rachel would clam up if I started asking questions.
 "I'm pretty sure Alec could take two of them, but not all three.
 They knew that, which was part of the reason they were pushing so hard."
 I felt shivers crawl up my spine, but what could someone say after something like that?
 Rachel reached over and gave me a hug.
 "Try not to think about it too much.
 Just remember that Alec's dominant to everyone here, and he'd die for either of us without even a heartbeat's worth of hesitation."
 After Rachel left I spent the next hour trying to get comfortable in Alec's desk chair.

But Adapt Korin was of a more casual evil; he never passed up the opportunity to hurt those around him, physically or emotionally.
 Ravenhurr had existed in the same body for the full eighteen years of Rodregas‚Äô service, and was hundreds of years old.
 In all his years serving in the tower Ravenhurr had only tried to hold the ceremony three times, each time abandoning the attempt due to the lack of a celestial animal.
 A celestial animal was extremely rare, but required as part of the ceremony for Ravenhurr‚Äôs next step up in power.
 In contrast, his assistant, the Adapt Korin, had been going though bodies constantly.
 Worse, he seemed to take great delight in letting people know what fate awaited them.
 Rape and torture of the victims were common occurrences with Korin.
 And Rodregas had dreamed of killing him almost from the start.
 Rodregas had hated Ravenhurr and knew that his Master could have stopped his assistant‚Äôs actions with a word.
 Ravenhurr had been simply too powerful for Rodregas to dream of destroying.

I noticed that she had left the door to the bedroom wide open and I wondered if someone was listening.
 I told her I was a ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù and a ‚Äúfamily man‚Äù and it just wasn‚Äôt worth the risk.
 She said she understood but if I changed my mind, she and her boyfriend would pay $25 per pill.
 I said thanks, but no thanks.
 She asked me to finish undressing and get on the bed for the massage.
 She stood directly in front of me, just a few steps away as I took off the last of my clothes and I stood there naked.
 I felt as if she stood there for me to prove l wasn‚Äôt a cop, who likely would leave at least his underwear on.
 She pointed to the bed that was now covered in a bright beach towel.
 I laid face down and she didn‚Äôt offer anything to cover me up as you would in a traditional massage.
 She straddled my buttocks and began to massage my back.

The sky was cornflower blue.
 We were parked on dirt near a bridge across the Tia Juana River, about fifty yards downstream from a squatter village of tin-roofed stick and cardboard shacks.
 The river was low and mossy green below a film tinted with shimmering rainbows.
 A few women in rebosos of vivid reds and oranges waded and filled clay pots and coffee cans with water.
 The ni√±os who crawled on the muddy bank had implausibly shiny hair and wide eyes of milk white and gleaming obsidian.
 Beyond the shanties, across the river and the road, a building invaded the sky.
 Shaped like a Hershey bar, only high as mountains and made of chrome and glass.
 A thousand beams from the rising sun ricocheted in prisms off it.
 I felt Cliff staring at me.
 He was in the back seat.

In that hour, a young man, our son, was in our vehicle and he spoke with confidence and newfound wisdom about what he was learning and how he was being taught to apply it to real life situations.
 At the brunch, the family watched as this same young man who was the subject of an intervention just a few months earlier, spoke calmly, listened to others and acted like a normal human being.
 We could not ignore this massive transformation in just two months as an inpatient.
 Lisa and I were thrilled.
 Giddy even.
 We drove Brandon back to the facility where they immediately drug tested him.
 It was routine, and he knew to expect it.
 We were allowed to stay until 8 pm and he was not about to let us leave one minute early.
 Brandon had been isolated so long; he just wanted to be with us, just to sit on a bench and talk.
 Before we left I told him that very few people in this world could say they were in the best place in the world they could be and that was exactly where he was.

I'd been expecting them to stop in front of Jasmin.
 Instead they'd passed her up and then declined to make a beeline to Cassie either.
 When they'd started handing the flowers to me, I'd tried to convince them there'd been some kind of mistake.
 The sound of 'One Day More' playing on the cell phone nestled in the closest bouquet had been what finally convinced me it was all meant for me.
 Brandon's voice had been like silk caressing my face when I'd answered the phone.
 One minute I was minding my own business trying to pretend like I didn't notice the nasty looks some of Brandon's friends were shooting my way when they thought I wasn't looking, the next I was going to the biggest dance of the year with the most popular guy in school.
 I'd half thought Cassie was going to rip out my throat.
 I walked past a pair of gorgeous, gold-fringed drapes, handed my ticket to a distinguished-looking man in a uniform, and then smiled as he pointed me towards my door.
 It was almost a relief to be around strangers again.
 He'd been polite, but hadn't tried to fawn over me.

I won't have you any more!"
 She took the handkerchief he'd just pulled from his pocket, wiping her face.
 "It's so horrible.
 If-if I were to keep this beautiful ring, the first thing I'd want to do would be to run to my mother and tell her all about it.
 But I can't go to her.
 And when I can finally run to her, I won't be wearing this ring."
 Slowly she removed the ring from her finger.
 "I love you, Rick.
 I feel torn apart.
 But I have to go home!"

 I think I wanted to play music, initially, to please her, to catch her attention.

 Patty Grabenhorst.
 Just saying the name is like a spell to me.
 Man, I wonder where that chick is today‚Äîshe must have grown up to be something.
 She moved away before high school, but, already you could see the beauty there.
 She was, um, saucy.

It's just a dance, not a funeral, and if you don't hold still your makeup isn't going to turn out right."
 Rachel poked me in the ribs, and then went back to work on the last few details of my 'new and improved' look.
 I'd actually been trying to sneak a look in the mirror to find out how everything was shaping up, but it wasn't worth trying to explain.
 With the pall that'd descended over the pack once we'd made it back, it was almost certain she wouldn't believe me.
 Nobody even knew where we'd gone, but they'd keyed off of our mood faster than I would've believed possible.
 The results hadn't been good.
 Jasmin stepped back around behind Dominic as I was watching, and for the first time I got a good idea of how the massively piled style Jasmin had been working on for the last half hour was going to turn out.
 Dominic frowned at my gasp.

A call to the officer confirmed we were on for 6 pm that night.
 I was instructed to call Ashley around 6 pm and tell her I would meet her as soon as I could get out of the house, and that I would call her when I left it.
 I prepared myself emotionally for another unpredictable evening.
 I was told to meet the officers at a different location behind a nearby grocery store near the loading dock and trash bins.
 I arrived promptly, eager to get this thing done, and was immediately disappointed to learn that there would be a delay getting the crew together as they had just busted an Ecstasy dealer and part of the crew was stuck hauling, booking and questioning him.
 I was irritated as they wired me up in anticipation of the bust.
 The officers then recorded my call to Ashley where I told her my wife had me watching the kids and unavailable until she returned, so I‚Äôd call her in a while.
 I was buying an unknown amount of time while keeping Ashley and Steve on the hook.
 So while I am standing in the lot wired up, not able to call my wife, not able to go anyplace myself, some of the officers take orders for a hamburger run!
 I am now beyond irritated, as their lackadaisical attitude could equal another disappointment and a setback for the mission to get my son on with his life and out of a possible prison sentence.

Hunger and famine are usually associated with a physical shortage of food.
 Yet, even where food supplies are adequate, absence of opportunities for gainful employment to generate the purchasing power needed to buy food can result in hunger.
 Lack of food and employment are the basis for the poverty that still afflicts one-fifth of humankind.
 When it comes to food there can be no justification or excuse ‚Äì everyone must have enough to eat, and can have enough.
 A world dedicated to upholding the political rights and property rights of nations and individuals cannot fail to recognize and enforce the most fundamental of all human rights ‚Äì the right to live.
 Contrary to the fears raised in earlier centuries and revived in recent decades, today the world does possess the capacity to feed everyone, even at current levels of food production ‚Äì subject as it is to disincentives, quotas, restrictions and trade barriers that food surplus countries impose to curtail food production, while other nations remain in perpetual deficit.
 In spite of a doubling of population in the developing countries since 1960, their average food supplies have increased from 1950 calories to 2475 calories per capita per day, or from an average of 90 per cent to 107 per cent of the minimum caloric requirement.
 During the past 12 years alone, per capita food production in developing countries has risen by 15 per cent.
 Overall, the proportion of people in developing countries suffering from hunger and mal nutrition has dropped dramatically both in relative and absolute terms, from 941 million people constituting 36 per cent of the population of these nations in 1970 to 781 million constituting less than 20 per cent of the population in 1990.
 Current projections indicate that the growth rate in world agricultural output will continue to exceed population growth over the next two decades.

We were leaving the third place when he asked me, ‚ÄúWhy do you do this?‚Äù "Excitement?"
 I guessed.
 Mike was sitting behind the driver‚Äôs seat.
 While the cabbie waited for an opening into the boulevard traffic, Mike leaned up close and growled, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good thing you don‚Äôt plan to get us roughed up, or else I‚Äôd have to pinch your head off.‚Äù The cabby muttered something in Spanish and made a face that seemed to say, ‚ÄúGo ahead, what do I care?‚Äù At an historic saloon called The Long Bar, Eric told me about all three prostitutes he‚Äôd talked to, where they came from, how large their families were, and he remembered most of their entire formal names.
 He spoke as if they had met at a box social.
 And he kept asking, ‚ÄúWhat can we do?‚Äù As if our mission was to fix all the world‚Äôs broken people.

Guard captain Antonil marched through the street, leading fifty of his men marching in perfect union.
 His face was a portrait of stoic calm, but it was all a lie.
 His heart was troubled and he had not a soul to tell why.
 He held a proclamation of King Vaelor to the entire nation of Neldar.
 He had argued as best he could, but his words meant little.
 When Antonil asked that someone else deliver the proclamation, a frown had crossed the king‚Äôs smooth face and he had slammed his lotioned hand against a table.
 ‚ÄúIt will mean more coming from you!‚Äù the king had shouted.
 ‚ÄúThey will know the seriousness of my order.
 I will not be flooded with spies, treated like a mere peasant, and then insulted by such blatant snubbing of my humble call for aid.
 Let them know I am king, my dear Antonil.

And she should have asked Rick to set an alarm for her so that she could have walked in the garden this morning.

 "Want to watch `Bonanza'?"

ICPF has no hesitation in putting forward ideas that are bound to unsettle, and it should be encouraged since imagination and daring are precisely what we need at the present time.
 Its calls for a standing world army, for the recognition of full employment as a fundamental right and for the elimination of protectionist trade policies to mention but a few examples will cause some sharp intakes of breath among world leaders.
 Indeed, the report contains many ideas that merit and should stimulate further reflection.
 The situation of the countries in transition in Eastern Europe, high lighted in this report, illustrates perfectly the need for an integrated approach to development considered as a total human process.
 The Commission's report contains specific proposals in this regard as well as an overview pointing to existing domestic assets of various kinds which could help the countries concerned.
 It addresses the topic of job creation with innovative ideas on the roles of technology and trade, and emphasizes the significance of the developing countries and agricul ture in the world economy.
 Its global education programme proposal placing appropriate emphasis on the key issue of girls' and women's education is one that particularly commends itself to UNESCO, which is already actively engaged in efforts along similar lines in conjunction with its UN partners.
 This timely report should help to promote the idea of human-centred development within a culture of peace as a way forward to a better world.
 We are gratified that ICPF should have assigned UNESCO, as the intellectual arm of the United Nations, a prominent role in its recommended agenda for action, and we reaffirm our commit ment to working with all possible partners in pursuit of the goal of global peace and sustainable human development.

Go find it.‚Äù Eric and I bought Kerouac‚Äôs On the Road, and checked out Dharma Bums and his latest, Big Sur, a memoir in minimal disguise, about a fellow who goes to a cabin in the forest to recover from drunkenness and fame.
 Imagine Henry David Thoreau as a neurotic who returns to Walden Pond and finds psychosis awaiting him there.
 Still, we concluded that a poet of Kerouac's passion and skill, who could make a hangover feel romantic, would pull out of his tailspin and rise again.
 That fall, Eric and I read most every day, then sat in my backyard or on a beach or sea cliff and talked for hours at a spell.
 Also, we worked at odd jobs, sold some possessions, and saved most of whatever our moms gave us.
 We needed gas money, so we could chase visions of Kerouac and his Beat pals through the places they haunted at the west end of their cross-country odysseys.
 Twice that fall, the minute school let out on Friday, we sped north on Highway 101.
 From Morro Bay to Santa Cruz, we followed the coast and made camp for the night on a cliff between Hearst Castle and Big Sur.
 Saturday, midmorning, we landed in North Beach, San Francisco.
 As we passed strip joints whose signage featured females twice as buxom as Lil' Abner's Daisy Mae, doormen beckoned and dared us to enter, though we were four years underage.

Jack Nicholson was there.
 Debbie Anspach, Donald Sutherland, Larry Hagman, Candice Bergen, Dennis Hopper, Jagger, Ringo.
 Some said Dylan was there, in disguise.
 It was Dylan who was later quoted widely as saying, ‚ÄúBuddy could have been bigger than me.
 He had Old Harry on his side.‚Äù With bigger success came more drugs, more women, more more.
 Death.
 The official ruling was death by asphyxiation, choking on his own vomitus.
 It began to seem coroners handed this out to rock stars by rote.
 Janis and Jimi set the standard; anything less would be unseemly, not up to snuff.
 Next to his naked body were the clich√© syringe, bottle of Jack Daniels and a sheet of lyrics, a half-finished song to be called, apparently, ‚ÄúWendy Ward Redux,‚Äù as if at the end he tried to return to past glories and died trying.

Dirk asked as they warmed up.
 "No--I was in bed reading the paper."
 "I was in bed too--and desperately needed to get out.
 Thanks for the rescue."
 Rick shook his head.
 Dirk, at 28 three years younger than Rick, was as leery of marriage as Rick, but for different reasons.
 He liked having a variety of women to choose from, frequently juggled more than one relationship--if you could call them that--at once, and sometimes seemed to enjoy getting caught at it so that he could put his charm to a real test.
 "I ran into Kim the other day."
 Dirk hit the ball.
 "Kim who?"

She wasn't supposed to do anything but smile and sip her drink, but when the star gave her a smoldering glance during rehearsal, the director decided he wanted to film it.
 The result was a split-second close-up of her face, and the star kissed her hand.
 Marie felt as if she were going to burst from excitement.
 They were allowed to watch filming until lunch, and then they were given a tour of the rest of the studio.
 Marie heard obscenities and shouting, and she saw two different actors storm off two different sets in the middle of their scenes.
 But it was wonderful.
 The actors and actresses were very attractive people, and many of them were nice to her.
 "Today was magic, absolute magic," Marie sighed as they ate steak and salad that evening.
 Rick smiled.
 "You weren't disappointed then?"

Three factors are at play in most conflict situations: the absence of developed democratic institutions, the absence or abuse of fundamental human rights, and the inability to make those choices in the management of public policy on which good governance depends.
 Authoritarian governments find justification for their existence in the presence of external threats to national security, in times of war and during periods of imperialist expansionism.
 They have a vested interest in maintaining a state of tension or initiating conflicts.
 In contrast, empirical evidence shows that liberal democracies do not go to war against one another.
 A study by Dean V. Babst of 116 major wars from 1789 to 1941 revealed that ‚Äòno wars have been fought between independent nations with elective governments‚Äô.
 The reasons for this are several.
 Democracies tend to be more prosperous and better educated.
 They share common political cultures based on individual rights and liberties.
 They establish orderly and peaceful processes for conflict resolution within society.
 In addition, elected governments find it extremely difficult to win public support for initiating and sustaining wars in which the country‚Äôs own citizenry must fight, except in order to rebuff or forestall external aggression, as illustrated by domestic opposition to America‚Äôs role in Vietnam.

Chevelle was not alone.
 A statuesque elf with pitch-black hair and eyes rose as I came into view.
 Not in the respectful ‚Äòa lady entered the room‚Äô way, but in a way that led me to believe he wasn‚Äôt happy to have me, or anyone, find him there.
 He held a long staff, gripped so tightly his knuckles whitened, and he was dressed in casual traveling clothes that didn‚Äôt seem to fit his posture.
 I found myself questioning whether it were a disguise, and then I chastised myself for wandering around in ridiculous thoughts so often.
 They were watching me.
 Cursed brain fog.
 I stood there for a moment, unsure if I should leave the room after I had so obviously interrupted or pretend I had a mission and make my way to Ruby‚Äôs room.
 I clearly wasn‚Äôt welcome there.
 Neither spoke, so I lowered my gaze to the floor, taking the shortest route to Ruby‚Äôs door and closing it hastily behind me.

Marie was in the living room with her mother and brother, and they jumped when they heard him begin shouting.
 They'd had only enough time to look at each other in bewilderment when Mr. Tranton joined them.
 "Young Runyon will be here within the hour."
 Understanding dawned, and Marie said quietly, "He didn't want to come until after work, did he?"
 "There's a big account and .

 well, as I said, he'll be here within the hour."
 To Marie's amazement, after her father had bathed, shaved, and dressed, he rejoined them in the living room with a cup of coffee.

Ruby relaxed and stepped away from me.
 I wanted to catch up with what had happened but no one was talking, the mountain was silent.
 Rhys and Rider were once again gone from sight.
 ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you going to perform the death ceremony?‚Äù I worried as the other elves began walking away.
 Anvil spat on the mangled body.
 The corpse.

I thought of the wolves.
 If I had an animal trained, I could call it to me to use at my leisure.
 I had no idea where they were now.
 Besides, the thought of entering those massive, vicious-looking animals made me uneasy.
 Maybe I could get in on the hunt tonight, find something away from the clatter of rocks under horse hooves.
 At the lack of options, I closed my eyes again to fall into Steed‚Äôs horse.
 It felt similar to my own, though I could tell he had more power, more confidence.
 I pulled back and experimented with each of the other horses.
 Anvil‚Äôs seemed slower, fatigued.
 The others were about the same, though I noticed Chevelle‚Äôs horse was more skittish.

 But I also love my home.

 She stood on her toes and gave him a quick, soft kiss on his lips.
 A tear ran down Harruq‚Äôs cheek as he stood in shock.
 His mind relished the soft feel of her lips on his, the scent of flowers, and the subtle fire that had escaped onto his tongue.

My angry gaze turned on my new acquaintance and he raised his hands in surrender, still chuckling.
 ‚ÄúI take it you know him?‚Äù he asked.
 ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs following me,‚Äù I announced, too loud.
 His eyes were concerned, so I let down my guard, moving to stand behind him.
 Chevelle approached us, staring directly at me as if there were not the broad, tall form of the stranger between us.
 He let me see his irritation for one long moment before his features melted back into their standard sternness.
 For some reason, it infuriated me, and I nearly berated him right there.
 But I remembered I was on the run.
 I remembered this strange elf in front of me.
 I decided to keep my mouth shut before I dug a deeper hole.

If past trends continue, it will create another 1.3 billion during the next 35 years.
 The current anxiety in the West is similar to that which the United States passed through in the 1890s when agricultural mechanization displaced 4.4 million farm workers, generating double digit unemployment and visions of a dismal future.
 Yet, since then, employment in the United States has expanded by nearly 100 million jobs or 400 per cent.
 Between 1990 and 2005, it is projected to increase by another 25 million.
 The same process of structural transition is repeating itself today and raising the same anxieties.
 Contrary to common belief, the US employment rate, the percentage of total population with jobs, has risen steadily throughout the century from 38 per cent to 46 per cent of the total population and is expected to reach 51 per cent by 2005.
 This trend is true for the industrial nations as a whole.
 Between 1960 and 1992, total employment in OECD countries rose by 110 million jobs or 44 per cent, including a 22 per cent increase in the participation of women in the workforce.
 During this same period, un employment rose by 23 million persons, representing a 259 per cent increase in the overall unemployment rate.
 More people are working than ever before, yet at the same time more people are unemployed, because a larger proportion of the population seek jobs.

The expansion of agricultural exports under the new GATT agreement is likely to exacerbate the falling commodity price syndrome to the great detriment of the entire world economy, unless effective mechanisms are introduced to stabilize international commodity prices.
 Of the many efforts in the past, some were tried and failed, many were proposed but never implemented.
 The recent success of coffee-producing countries in lifting prices from a disastrously low level has been an exception to the rule.
 Collective and coordinated international action is essential to address this problem.
 Despite past failures, new efforts must be made to revive international commodity agreements, preferably covering both producing and consuming countries.
 This will be possible only if developing countries first arrive at a consensus approach among themselves, including the economic costs and benefits, and a financing plan.
 Financing for international commodity stocks could be supplied partly by producer countries in the form of building national stocks under collective supervision.
 Partly, it could come from bank commercial loans against commodity collateral, loans from regional development banks, the World Bank and IMF's Buffer Stock Facility, which has remained almost unused.
 8.Technology transfer: Accelerate transfer of technology to and between developing countries.
 One or more profit-making commercial organizations should be established as a public sector joint venture of developing countries to promote the commercial transfer of technology to, within and between developing countries and to channel the profits from this activity toward research in these countries.

There was something not right with my complexion, but what was really off was just above my face.
 I squinted, leaning toward the mirror as my hands reached up of their own accord.
 The first quarter inch of my hair was blackened.
 I parted my hair in a different area and then again, but the base of my hair was dark over my entire scalp.
 My fingers began to tremble against my skin; I could come up with no plausible explanation for the change.
 ‚ÄúJunnie,‚Äù I called out again.
 She didn‚Äôt answer.
 The study was empty.
 I let out a shaky breath and glanced around.
 Nothing was out of place except for a thistle on the table.

I've seen what it's done to my mother.
 How can I say I love you if I turn around and do the same thing to you?"
 For a second I couldn't even think.
 He'd just used the 'L-word', and my heart felt like it was tearing itself apart inside my chest.
 In the subtle shadings we girls used to measure commitment, it wasn't as good as if he'd come right out and said, 'I love you Adriana Paige', but it was still pretty good, and it was a complete first for me.
 Once I made it past the second part of his statement, I was able to start considering the first part of what he'd said.
 It was horrifying and amazing all at once, and it made complete sense.
 His mom was living in memories because the real world was just a pale shadow of her life with his father.
 Alec seemed to take my silence as condemnation, or possibly just agreement with his self-condemnation.

 Then we started to fall.

 ‚ÄúThis brings new meaning to ‚Äòthings can‚Äôt get any worse!‚Äô‚Äù I gripped furiously to the limp dragon.
 I was falling to my death: so this is how it was going to end.
 I never pictured it this way; I thought I would die a little more heroically, not screaming like a little girl.

Then he died.
 ‚ÄúWhat did you do to him?‚Äù Harruq asked once the man was dead.
 ‚ÄúFear is an entertaining weapon, is it not?‚Äù
 The warrior shook his head in wonder, but Qurrah said no more.
 ‚ÄúDo we leave the bodies here?‚Äù Harruq asked.
 The necromancer trotted over to the dead noble and did not answer.
 Instead, he ruffled through the silk robes until he found a scroll marked with the seal of the king.
 Qurrah ripped it to shreds and let the pieces scatter in the wind, then he turned to his brother.
 ‚ÄúDo you remember what our Master wanted?‚Äù
 Harruq unsheathed Condemnation and nodded.

"There's something I'd like you to have.
 Something I hope will help you remember what you mean to me..." He trailed off, and then seemingly at a loss for words, reached out and lifted the black velvet that'd been covering the painting.
 Another graceful gesture flipped on the set of soft lights surrounding its border.
 As always with Alec's paintings, it took me a second before I could shift my perspective enough to translate the beautiful formations of light into something I could tie to the drab, dreary world I inhabited.
 It was the same grotto where we now stood.
 The warm glow from the climbing ivory and roses formed a backdrop awash in the silvery light of a full moon.
 Just visible off to one side was the pool, alive with enough microscopic life to give it a pale glow of its own to compliment the off-center reflection of a hundred tiny lights.
 A few seconds later I finally recognized that the subject of the piece was a female, reaching out towards the point of view with glowing hands.
 "She's beautiful.
 It's how I always imagined an angel would appear."

I was still reeling in surprise as we walked out to the parking lot and met up with the rest of the pack, or rather the rest of the pack minus Alec.
 He'd shown up several minutes later, looking very satisfied with himself, but obviously unwilling to answer any questions.
 As we caravanned home, I realized the collection of vehicles carrying us back to Alec's estate probably cost more than my house.
 Donovan had met us at the door and conducted us to the dining room, where Alec and his friends devoured a sizable meal.
 Even back when I'd had a more substantial appetite, I still couldn't have kept up with the wolves.
 Even the girls packed away more food than I would've believed possible for such slender frames.
 I mentally shrugged and added it to the list of shape shifter benefits.
 Able to eat like a complete pig and still slip into size zero jeans.

 She probably would've spent even longer with me, but Mom called, so Dominic slipped out to give me some privacy.

So I told the school I was staying with my aunt and uncle and told my aunt I was staying with Eric and Sylvia.
 In truth, Eric moved in with me.
 On school days when the ocean beckoned, I might stop by the hospital at visiting hours, wash up and don a smock, spend a few minutes with my mom, and get her to sign absence slips.
 Eric didn‚Äôt need absence slips.
 If he returned to school after an absence and told the attendance clerk he‚Äôd been out with the one-day variety of bubonic plague, she would have excused him rather than phone his mother to verify.
 When anyone from the school called Sylvia, she might hold the person on the phone for an hour, ranting about their misdeeds.
 I have two pictures of Eric.
 His senior picture, given a full page in our senior-year annual, a head shot of keen blue eyes with thick lashes, freckles, and sandy hair, a chin square as Dick Tracy‚Äôs, an easy grin that would have wrongly convinced you he was loaded with confidence.
 And the one Sylvia called the ‚ÄúJesus body picture‚Äù a snapshot somebody took in the locker room.
 Eric in a jock strap, beaming, his legs and arms spread as though to greet a familiar angel.

Rodregas raised his hand up in a peaceful motion.
 She probably had nowhere else to go.
 He ignored her and went to the cabinets and the cold box.
 He got out cheese and bread, found some fruit and had a good simple meal.
 He would need to pack as much food as possible for his journey.
 The old kitchen drudge was still peeling the same potato when he left the kitchen.
 Freshly fed and feeling better for it, Rodregas went across the main hall and entered the door opposite the kitchen into the barracks section of the keep.
 The place was about as messy as he had ever seen it; the normal tidiness demanded by Captain Poir had apparently been put aside in excitement over the chance to take some time off for the celebration.
 His personal bunk and trunk were a mess.
 His good blanket was missing, as was his spare pair of boots and most of his other belongings.

It was wide but not deep.
 Painful too, he noticed as he took a few steps.
 Furious, he turned back to the corpse of the drunken man and smashed a fist against its chest.
 The body shriveled into dust, only the bones remaining.
 ‚ÄúHalt!‚Äù shouted a voice from far down the street.
 Qurrah glimpsed an elf carrying a bow.
 Just one, the half-orc noticed, but that would quickly change.
 ‚ÄúPerhaps you‚Äôll have some use after all,‚Äù Qurrah said to the bones.
 He whispered words of magic as the elf took a few steps closer and notched an arrow.
 A purple fire surrounded the bones, pulled them into the air, and then hurled them in a giant wave.

Brandon flashed me another smile and quickly maneuvered his car through a U-turn, a feat I was fairly certain was harder than it looked in the bulky muscle car.
 "No harm done.
 You guys bought the old Anderson home then?"
 I nodded, staring out at the desolate landscape.
 "You mean every single person in town doesn't already know everything there is to know about us?"
 "Oh, the joys of a small town.
 Yeah, with as little real news as we get out here, people probably know more about you than you're used to.
 It has its benefits though."
 I snorted, and then felt myself turning red with embarrassment.
 You would think after seventeen years I'd have learned how to laugh without making those wretched sounds.

What are they saying?
 Ruby remained protectively in front of me, her posture lowered, arms tensed tighter since the stranger turned his eyes on me.
 His face twisted in agony as his right arm was dislocated from its socket, leaving the limb hanging limply at the shoulder.
 I was glad I didn‚Äôt hear that sound.
 He turned back to his questioner, his mouth a grimace as the words came out, unmistakably a curse, and his other arm was wrenched from its place as well.
 He winced, apparently not yet numb from the damages, and then his face went hard, his lips pressed together, jaw clenched tight.
 He wasn‚Äôt going to scream.
 Or talk.
 His back twisted and he fell, a motionless heap on the ground.
 His body was bent out of recognition.

But, whatever magic locks were in force were just too secure.
 So, he had to use brute strength to shatter the doors one by one.
 Several of the books fell during his struggles with the cabinet.
 Rodregas reached down and grabbed a couple of them, and then dropped them right back to the ground in shock as evil licked his hand.
 He shook the feeling off his hand and went back to the water closet and washed it in the water basin.
 Of course he knew there was nothing physically on his hand, but he also knew that water was a natural purifier and disrupted many magical influences.
 What he had felt was simply disgusting.
 Why would a book, no matter what its contents, have such a feel to it?
 He walked back to the book and got down on the ground.
 Without actually touching it, Rodregas slowly ran his fingertips along the binder of the book.

The growth of agricultural incomes in developing countries is critically important to global job creation and economic growth.
 The expansion of agricultural exports under the new GATT agreement is likely to exacerbate the falling commodity price syndrome to the great detriment of the entire world economy, unless effective mechanisms are introduced to stabilize international commodity prices.
 Of the many efforts in the past, some were tried and failed, many were proposed but never implemented.
 The recent success of coffee-producing countries in lifting prices from a disastrously low level has been an exception to the rule.
 Collective and coordinated international action is essential to address this problem.
 Despite past failures, new efforts must be made to revive international commodity agreements, preferably covering both producing and consuming countries.
 This will be possible only if developing countries first arrive at a consensus approach among themselves, including the economic costs and benefits, and a financing plan.
 Financing for international commodity stocks could be supplied partly by producer countries in the form of building national stocks under collective supervision.
 Partly, it could come from bank commercial loans against commodity collateral, loans from regional development banks, the World Bank and IMF's Buffer Stock Facility, which has remained almost unused.
 8.Technology transfer: Accelerate transfer of technology to and between developing countries.

And yes, we can most definitely go to one of the libraries.
 In fact, I believe you'll find the smaller one quite satisfactory.
 It has a copy of every textbook currently in use at your high school, in case you reconsider."
 There were more turns than I had any hope of ever remembering, but eventually we made it to a familiar-looking door.
 At a nod from Donovan I pushed it open, and then as the furnishings registered, I turned back around.
 "This is Alec's room.
 I couldn't possibly..." Donovan shook his head.
 "Young Mr. Graves instructed that you were to have every convenience.
 I'm sure that included access to what we all jokingly call the second library.
 Besides, this is where you'll find the copies of all your textbooks."

Their skin was shriveled and grey, and hung off their bodies like cold clothing.
 Their eyes were a bright yellow that matching their teeth and their fingers looked like gnarly old trees.
 And the smell; it was awful.
 They grabbed my feet, back and tugged at my hair.
 ‚ÄúWhy does everything always happen to me?‚Äù I complained.
 No one heard me.
 The ugly creatures continued tugging at me like annoying two year old, which made me get really annoyed.
 ‚ÄúGet off me ugly looking toad dwarfs.

Someday maybe though."
 This time I was going to pry, but he preempted my question.
 "It looks like we'd better be going or we'll both be late."
 Les Mis√©rables.
 I managed to put the impending drawing more or less out of my mind for the first half of the day, but I actually missed Britney's constant gossip.
 There was almost no redeeming value to most of what she said, but it did have the benefit of being distracting.
 By the time lunch finally came around I needed some kind of distraction.
 This was my only chance to see Les Mis√©rables performed live before I turned forty.
 Unfortunately, while the conversation at Brandon's table was plentiful, it wasn't very distracting.
 I was quickly realizing that Brandon's friends weren't very nice.

Before I got in the limousine a man walked up to me and introduced himself as Grandpa‚Äôs doctor.
 He handed me a bottle of small white pills and told me they were nitroglycerine tablets and to get one under the old man‚Äôs tongue if he seemed to be having a heart attack.
 Great, Grandpa is rambling in Greek and may die on my watch!
 At least Dino is not here to beat me if I fuck this up.
 So in the limo I‚Äôm tossing these little white pills in Grandpa‚Äôs mouth like candy.
 I have no idea what I am doing, but he is still alive and rambling away in Greek.
 As the limo drives from location to location for this funeral-a-thon, my little brother Harry is watching a helicopter above us.
 At first, it is a welcome distraction, but the chopper keeps showing up.
 We see it through the limo‚Äôs glass sunroof, then notice it when we are getting in and out of limo.
 The longer this goes on it becomes an obsession for all of us (except Grandpa who is likely about to overdose on little white pills which have the name of an explosive!)

When the battle comes, slaughter the elves from behind.
 You must weaken them enough so that Vaelor‚Äôs army has a chance at victory.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúWhere will we meet you?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúListen for where the screams are at their worst,‚Äù Velixar said as his shadow began to fade.
 ‚ÄúThere shall I be.‚Äù
 A pale hand reached inside his robes and pulled out five glass vials.
 Qurrah knelt and accepted the gifts.
 ‚ÄúThe vials contain powerful healing elixirs.
 If either of you are injured tomorrow, drink from them and resume the slaughter anew.‚Äù

Qurrah waited until Harruq was around the corner before taking out one of his small glass vials.
 Before he could pull the cork off the top, he heard a voice speak.
 ‚ÄúSo many dead by your hands yet a single arrow nearly takes your life?‚Äù
 The half-orc froze, the vial clutched in his hands.
 An elf emerged from behind the building, his body decorated in a brilliant green cloak and silvery armor.
 It was the same elf who had fired the first warning shot to Antonil before the entire battle had begun.
 ‚ÄúI am but a poor outcast,‚Äù Qurrah said, hiding the handle of the whip underneath the palm of his hand.
 The coiled leather vibrated, hungering for blood.
 ‚ÄúDo not lie to me.
 I have watched you two slaughter my brethren.

The evolution of larger, heterogeneous national units functioning under principles of equality is an outstanding product of civilization that should not and cannot be reversed without great damage to the general welfare of humanity.
 The only solution is to work constantly to educate the public in all countries to understand the benefits of national integration and international cooperation.
 The implications of this view will be endorsed by some and opposed by others.
 Acceptance must be fostered through education and discussion rather than unilateral forced initiative.
 Preventive Diplomacy, Peace Making and Peace Building
 The answers to the questions regarding national sovereignty and international responsibility will determine the scope of UN preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peace building in years to come.
 They must be addressed with a view to evolving valid principles of international law, rather than remaining subject to frequent reversals of public policy by member states based on the short-term impact of the media on current public opinion.
 Granted that a consensus is reached regarding these larger issues of principle, there still will remain immense problems relating to implementation, as illustrated by the recent failure of international intervention in Somalia.
 Whatever may be the limits placed on the UN‚Äôs mandate for action, it is clear that it cannot carry out that mandate effectively under the current constraints imposed on it by member states through indecisiveness, narrowly defined interests and lack of political commitment.
 Once again the inherent weaknesses in the structure of the UN organization impact negatively on its capacity to perform the tasks rightfully allotted to it.

Trying to explain that she hadn't seen the look from my end, that Isaac most definitely hadn't been attracted to me, would be useless.
 I was pleasantly surprised when Britney's annoyance seemed to have blown over by the time we left the building.
 Before we'd even made it out of the parking lot, Britney was once again chattering about everyone else in the school and what they were or weren't doing lately.
 Considering that I still couldn't put a face with most of the names she was tossing around, the gossip wasn't just uninteresting, it was a near ordeal.
 It wasn't until I looked over at the speedometer that I realized we really had been driving longer than normal rather than the gossip just making it seem to take forever.
 Britney caught me registering the fact she was driving under the speed limit for the first time I could remember, and broke off recounting Amy Stevens' supposed fling with one of the football players just long enough to blush.
 "I figured I should be more careful of how fast I drive.
 You know, my dad keeps threatening to take away my car if I get any more tickets.
 With everything else going on right now he just might do it."
 It was actually pretty plausible.

She couldn't even imagine touching Davis like this, and she didn't think it had anything to do with morals.
 She just didn't feel comfortable enough with him to do something this personal.
 Yet here she was running her hands all over the back of a man she'd known only a week.
 Was it a difference in morals?
 Or times?
 Or was it Rick?
 She'd never known a man so warm and kind and open.
 Feeling a surge of affection, she slid her arms around his waist, laying her cheek against his back.
 "How does that feel?"
 "Better than you could ever imagine."

 "I'm sorry; I don't understand what you mean."
 "Alec's finally fallen in love, and with such a lovely girl.
 I was half worried he was going to spend the rest of his life so mired in responsibility, he'd never let himself notice anyone."
 I was flabbergasted, but my lack of response didn't faze her in the slightest.
 "I take it he finally realized you aren't a shape shifter then?"
 Apparently my astonishment leaked through to my expression, that or maybe she could just smell the shock on me.
 Whatever the reason, her smile took on new intensity, and she slowly reached out and clasped my hand again.
 "I'm sorry; I spend so much of my time alone with my thoughts that they develop well-worn grooves.
 I forget sometimes that other people haven't been privy to the endless hours of speculation that got me from one point to another."

 Outside, with the temperature something below zero, I trudged and slid up the sidewalk the few blocks to Tony‚Äôs place.

I led him to a set of stones to sit, wanting to get answers to all the questions that had been burning in my mind since I had spotted them.
 He had forgotten his prey, so I offered to help him with it.
 This befuddled him, so I simply skinned and spitted the animal while he sat, staring in amazement.
 It was like he‚Äôd never seen fire before.
 It made the magic fun again.

 I shook off the memory of practice and focused on the human.

 But I remembered reading the human lifespan was very brief.

I tell her to just come to my truck and let‚Äôs get this deal done.
 Ashley states she is suspicious that I won‚Äôt drive a hundred yards to meet her.
 I make a judgment call that I know will not make the undercover narcotics team happy but she is right, what is my great reason justifying not driving a short distance?
 I tell her I will drive right over and park by the Starbucks.
 I hang up with her and I state into my wire that we are moving to the Starbucks and to deal with it.
 My head set rings from my personal cell phone and the lead officer is a combination of irritated and understanding but he warns me to drive slowly and not to get too far in front of the van which will be coming in behind me.
 I am already backing up as he speaks to me.
 I am told to park against something, a wall or a spot in front of a store but not to park in the middle of the lot leaving all sides open.
 I notice the surveillance van coming up one of the isles as I pull onto the same path the Dodge Charger took which leads directly to the Starbucks.
 The van pulls in behind me at a comfortable distance.

 I'm so sorry to be such a bother."
 The words were broken by gasping sobs, but they were understandable, if only just barely.

 Not after everything else he'd already done for me.
 Guilting him into helping me more just felt wrong.

Working with a sure quickness any surgeon would have envied, Donovan wrapped my ankle and then examined his handiwork with a nod of approval.
 "That should take care of the pain and immobilize it so it can begin healing, but it is vitally important that you don't put any weight on it, Mistress Paige."
 Alec gripped Donovan's shoulder in thanks, and then nodded as Donovan excused himself to go see to Jess.
 "We should go too.
 Poor Jess."
 Alec shook his head.
 "They've already got her mostly settled down.

Leave the tutor lab early, go somewhere else and kill some time until you were supposed to come home, and they'd never know the difference.
 Teachers were a little harder, but if you didn't have the help of your 'friends', then they became an insurmountable obstacle.
 The gears finally ground to a stop and Britney sighed as she put her head down on the table.
 I tried to stop from smiling at her theatrics, but happened to look over at Rachel just in time to see a matching smile on the younger girl's face.
 Before I could look away, Rachel held up the red side of her card.
 "Do you have a minute?"
 Happy to be able to do something, I hurried over and took a look at her open book.
 "Fractions, huh?"
 "Yeah, I'm supposed to reduce them after I finish adding, but I can't seem to get to the same answer as the book on this one."
 She'd transposed a couple of the numbers when working on one of the intermediate steps.

I am tucked away in a remote parking space at a retail shopping center.
 No one would normally park this far from the grocery store, which anchors an array of businesses, at least not this late at night in this sparsely populated lot.
 I know this place well, as this is where my wife and I buy our groceries.
 It is in an upper class neighborhood serving the wealthy residents who live in their posh homes nearby.
 The front of my truck faces a short decorative fence, which borders a greenbelt area, and I stare across the wetlands that the railing protects.
 As I sit, I think about the circumstances in my life that brought me to this spot.
 I am alert to my surroundings but distracted by my thoughts.
 The fingers on my left hand slowly stroke my bottom lip and then downward across my graying goatee.
 It is eerily quiet but my mind pounds with the noise in my head.
 My attention should be entirely on the task at hand and not the events in my life that lead me here, but my mind hiccoughs.

It was a slow song this time, and Alec didn't protest when I abandoned all pretense of actual dancing, and just leaned into him hungrily.
 The reassurance I was seeking was weaker than normal.
 The solid feel of his body was just as permanent as always, but there was no tingle where our skin touched.
 Almost as though sensing my thoughts, Alec hugged me tightly and buried his chin in my hair.
 "I know you don't want to hear this, but it isn't too late for you to change your mind.
 Even now, it'd be a relatively simple thing to have you halfway across the country by the time the challenge actually occurs."
 The thought of what was coming filled me with dread, but I shook my head.
 As scary as all of this was, I knew flying away and never knowing what'd happened would be worse.
 Alec was probably going to die, and all of the rest of us with him, but if he didn't, if the pack somehow managed to survive the coming crisis, I wanted to be there.
 Alec was more than capable of sending me away and then never letting me know he'd survived.

I mean if she was a royal wolf and you hadn't manifested your hybrid form yet did she win all of the fights?"
 Alec rested his cheek on the top of my head.
 "Not exactly.
 If she'd been a little more heartless she probably could have killed me and cowed the rest of the pack.
 Even then though, it was becoming pretty clear that we couldn't have two separate packs in such close proximity.
 The need to keep the pack strong meant that even though she pretty much ran the show most of the time there was the occasional thing that I'd just refuse to back down on."
 His muscles tightened unconsciously, like maybe he was remembering past pains.
 "She'd rip me up one side and down the other but on the most important stuff I'd simply out stubborn her.
 When the dust settled usually I at least got a compromise we could both live with."
 I hugged him tighter for a second.

What is strange is this is not a farm designed by Nymphs.
 The design of the home and barn is clearly human, yet it would be strange for a simple farmer to be able to afford to have his building built of Nymph stone and way up here in this remote place,‚Äù She said.
 ‚ÄúSir Paladin,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan asked, ‚ÄúYou said you traveled here the first time with friends.
 Might they tell folks of this place?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Rodregas answered, ‚Äúthey were not exactly friends, and they both died long ago.
 Plus, they had no magic and did not even realize this place was on a ley line, and I never told them.
 They just saw an old farm house in bad repair.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo, what now,‚Äù Doi‚Äôvan asked?
 ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Rodregas said, ‚ÄúI think we should just sleep here tonight.
 We can try the house in the morning.
 But I don‚Äôt want to disturb the Dire Cats during the night.‚Äù They both nodded.
 They had come to the same thought already.

Such a mechanism, so long as it is inclusive, would provide a real and viable alternative to national militarization, whether or not it was constituted by or within the UN system.
 The success of NATO in maintaining peaceful relations among the democratic states of Western Europe and North America for more than half a century is a viable model which is limited primarily by the exclusivity of its membership.
 The recent measures taken by the European Union to constitute a European Army are evidence of the practicality of establishing a similar mechanism open to all nations.
 The unfortunate situation now witnessed in Iraq could have been avoided, if ICPF‚Äôs plea for a World Peace Army had been heeded.
 Eradicating the Roots of Terrorism: Terrorism is not new to the world, but with the withdrawal of national rivalries between East and West, violence by non-nation states has increased in intensity and is viewed as a far greater security concern by the entire world.
 This has spurred an unprecedented international effort to control and suppress terrorist activity.
 But there is little hope of abolishing this menace without simultaneously comprehending and addressing the root causes of terrorism in the world today.
 In a sense, the human urge for violence has neither increased nor decreased.
 It has simply shifted the field of expression from confrontation between nation states to confrontation between powerful governments and disenchanted, disenfranchised groups of individuals who respond to the application of superior power by nation states with the application of indiscriminate violence against the public-at-large.
 Terrorism thrives in the absence of effective democratic institutions to give voice to the will of its citizens.

"So did I."
 She felt his breath in her mouth.
 "I can tell."
 He nibbled at her lips.
 "I was very proud of you tonight."
 "Really?"
 She clutched at his shoulders, her breath coming faster.
 "Yeah."
 He wove his fingers into her hair and began pressing kisses along her neck.

"Rick--" "Marie."
 He brushed his lips over hers and nuzzled her cheek before burying his face in her neck.
 He was holding her so tightly and her heart was beating so hard that she was sure he could feel it.
 She wanted to kiss him more than she'd ever wanted anything .
 .
 .
 but it wasn't right.
 She was betrothed to Davis.
 She couldn't kiss another man.
 Reluctantly she pulled away.

We began our work with the conviction that, as Willy Brandt said, 'the problems created by men can be solved by men'.
 The ancient Indian scripture, Bhagavad Gita, expressed the same sentiment by stressing, 'Whatever man aspires to, that he can accomplish.'
 The achievement of food self-sufficiency by India in a period when famine threatened millions of lives through the power of political will and scientific action in a democratic society illustrates this truth.
 In spite of such uncommon opportunities for a better common present, during the last six years the world has been witness to an escalation of ethnic and mini-conflicts, growing intolerance of diversity, the spread of small arms, an increase in violence starting with violence to oneself through drug addiction and damage to the life support systems of land, water, flora, fauna and the atmosphere.
 In addition, the current pattern of economic and technological growth is leading to gross social inequity and rising joblessness.
 The rich-poor divide is widening both within and among nations.
 At the same time, the spread of knowledge and information, particularly through the electronic media, has led to an era of rising expectations.
 The economically and socially underprivileged sections of human society are now aware that their future is not a question of fate, but of political and technological choice.
 If they are not given access to the information superhighways and other technological highways to progress, a new form of social and economic apartheid will spread, which will be even more serious in its consequences to the future of human civilization than the skin-colour-based apartheid which has just ended.
 True education is leadership in thought.

My heart had stopped.
 And then it surged as blood rushed to my face, my neck.
 My ears rang.
 I must have been speaking or cursing.
 I could hear the sound, but could not make sense of it.
 Nothing made sense.
 I was standing before I knew I was surrounded.
 Fury and fire swam in my head, my chest, my hands.
 I heard them through the buzz.

Chevelle lowered his hand to mine and stood, pulling me up and toward the center of the clearing.
 When we‚Äôd distanced ourselves from the tree line, he stopped and turned back to me, still holding my right hand.
 My eyes followed his as he looked down at our clasped hands and a cool blue flame lit on my right sleeve.
 Immediately, my free hand jerked up to extinguish it.
 Chevelle took it to keep me from smacking at the flame, which had already disappeared.
 ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúuse the magic.
 Feel it.‚Äù I nodded and he returned his gaze to our hands, now both connected.
 He couldn‚Äôt have been much older than I, but his hands dwarfed mine and it made me feel suddenly, fleetingly, like a child again.
 A spark lit at the hem of my left sleeve and slowly worked its way up my arm.
 I wanted the fire off me, needed it put out.

"No, thank you.
 I think I'll just go to bed."
 Mrs. Tranton rose.
 "Would you like me to put your handkerchief in the laundry?"
 "No!"
 Marie recoiled.
 "This is Rick's.
 Please don't ever let Hattie wash it or the shirt."
 She nodded toward the t-shirt on the pillow.
 Mrs. Tranton gazed down at her for a moment.

I don't usually wear ribbons and bows; that was Emily's style.
 I pulled my hair back and tied the vine.
 It kept my hair out of my face and acted like a rubber band.
 ‚ÄúThanks Emily,‚Äù I said.
 She finished tying her hair back.
 ‚ÄúNo problem.
 We should look for somewhere to stay for the night.‚Äù I looked around, but everywhere was bare ground, hill after hill.
 ‚ÄúI don't see any caves.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe'll just have to sleep in the open,‚Äù she stated and pointed to a huge tree.
 ‚ÄúWe'll sleep under that tree.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said, a little disappointed.
 ‚ÄúSeth, Jason, we're going to sleep over here.‚Äù Jason sighed in relief and we all gathered around the bottom of the tree.

"Feel."
 She touched the cold food.
 "How does the box work?"
 "Frankly, I'm not sure.

 He put the bowl in the oven and set it for one minute.
 "Do you have electricity?"
 "My father had our house wired a few months ago."
 "Do you have a television?"
 "A what?"

He would have to escape the town, regardless of the patrols that swarmed the area.
 He waited until nightfall.
 Even in the dark the elves still patrolled, carrying no torches for their keen eyes had no trouble seeing in the starlight.
 The longer he hid and watched, the more Qurrah was convinced they searched for him.
 The Neldaren troops were long gone, Harruq with them.
 He knew he was being paranoid, but the only other person they could be searching for was Velixar, and the elves were deluding themselves if they thought they could handle him.
 When a smaller patrol turned a corner and vanished, he opened the door, winked at the bloody corpse near the window, and then slipped into the night.
 The scent of mourning floated throughout the town, and he paused to enjoy the bittersweet strands of death that tugged on his heart.
 So many souls lost in battle, and even in the quiet aftermath, it was intoxicating.
 ‚ÄúNo sleep tonight,‚Äù he said, turning back to the building that had been his shelter.

He never would have believed he could enjoy shopping, but he loved watching her discover new styles and new toys.
 He'd bought her a pocket calculator on the way to the shoe store.
 They were going to Teri's for dinner the next evening, and Marie showered and put on her new white dress and sandals when they got back from the shore.
 "How do I look?"
 she asked Rick when she joined him downstairs.
 "Beautiful."
 She was even darker than she'd been yesterday when she'd tried on the dress, and the contrast the dress made with her hair and skin was striking.
 "I can see where you two have been," Teri said when they arrived at her townhouse.
 "Yeah.

Between 1990 and 2000, malnutrition declined from 21 per cent to 18 per cent of the population of developing countries, but it actually increased marginally among the least developed nations, particularly in Africa.
 Incidence of malnutrition among children under five years of age remains severe in both Africa and South Asia.
 But the problem is more complex than these numbers suggest.
 Although India is considered a food surplus state, it is home to the largest number of undernourished people in the world and access to a balanced diet and clean drinking water is far below the basic requirements for sound health.
 Projections indicate that over the next decade growth of the world‚Äôs food supply will be adequate to meet the needs of all human beings.
 The UN Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of human beings suffering from hunger and malnutrition between 1990 and 2015 is highly commendable, yet achieving it would still leave an unconscionably large number of people without adequate food.
 More can and must be done in the next decade to eradicate the scourge of hunger.
 The problem of water scarcity is even more pervasive and challenging.
 Studies indicate that by 2015 more than half the world‚Äôs population ‚Äì mostly in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia and Northern China ‚Äì will be living in countries that are ‚Äòwater-stressed‚Äô.
 In the developing world, more than 80 per cent of the water is utilized for agriculture, an unsustainable level that is depleting water tables, increasing soil salinity and accelerating erosion.

He kissed her hair.
 "That's because it's become so natural to you."
 Rick sat in a chair across from Marie rather than joining her on the loveseat so that they wouldn't appear too familiar with each other.
 He was glad his conscience had gotten the best of him and kept him from seducing her Monday night.
 If having Teri and Jeremy suspect that they were living together embarrassed her, losing her virginity before marriage would devastate her.
 "So how did you like my sister?"
 Rick asked Marie when their guests had left.
 "She's really nice.
 So is Jeremy.
 I'd like to have them over again next week."
