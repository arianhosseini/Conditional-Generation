 He nodded to me.
 Grey.
 He was thoughtful for a moment, deciding the best way to display his skill, before finally approaching to offer his hand.
 I reached forward, placing my palm against his, and then he was gone.
 His entire body had vanished.
 I half expected to feel his touch—perhaps he’d merely camouflaged himself—but my hand was empty.
 I looked around, baffled.
 The makeshift audience wore easy, amused smiles.
 They watched me, not the vacant space from which Grey had evidently disappeared.

 He was still gorgeous, but the simple joy was gone.
 He no longer looked like something that couldn't exist in this world, but even with anger etched on his features my heart still skipped a beat.

He wisely did not say it out loud as every squire there would have been asking about where they had gotten one.
 Rodregas started to get up, but quickly decided it was smarter to stay lying down for now.
 “Where did we finish?” he asked.
 “Actually we did pretty good.
 There were more than a few that cannot go on, even if you had won.
 You finished eighth overall in the tournament, with a second place white ribbon for the joust.

The essence of shock therapy is a reliance on macro-economic factors to bring about a radical restructuring of the economy and a radical change in the behaviour of individuals and enterprises.
 While monetary policy may prove useful for dealing with short-term adjustment problems within a relatively stable environment, there is no evidence to support its use as the principle instrument for social transition.
 Monetary variables are indicators of the functioning of an economy, but the essential factors which determine the strength and health of an economy are the productivity of its enterprises and its workforce and the material resources of the country.
 Tight monetary policy can generate intense short-term pressure for change in behaviour, but this pressure is applied indiscriminately and often with unexpected and unanticipated results.
 The primary result of premature liberalization of prices was to encourage trade and speculation while discouraging production and investment.
 It distracted attention from fundamental changes in institutions and social attitudes needed for the transition to be successful.
 Macro-level policy measures have to be complemented and supported by parallel micro-level efforts to educate the population about the new economic system, to generate a free flow of information – not just freedom, but the actual exchange of information, which is still severely limited in these countries – to develop new distribution systems, to impart appropriate business and managerial skills, to provide access to credit, to build up new social institutions and to en courage and promote new enterprises.
 In most cities of the former Soviet Union, for instance, there is not a single whole sale market for food.
 There are no systems for consumer credit, no agencies in charge of promoting small business development.
 In the absence of these and other essential micro-level conditions, even the right macro-level strategy will not evoke the anticipated response.

he same approach to social change as the first step in the transition is a failure. It is an in--out--out-of-control effort to stimulate change in behaviour. It is not a response to the need92m for0m immediate action or a response to the need for the immediate<sep><cls>

Far down the street, where the road hooked left like the back leg of a dog, an elven archer approached, his bow ready.
 Two arrows flew into the air.
 Both half-orcs dodged as the arrows whistled past.

 Harruq charged, bellowing a mindless war cry.
 The archer fired two more arrows and then bolted around the corner.
 “He’s seen us!” Harruq shouted, easily veering about the arrows as he increased speed.
 “Wait, brother, it might be a trap!”
 Qurrah doubled over hacking, his reward for trying to shout so loud.

So he changed his mind and walked the course, and landed in the hospital.
 One evening Eric gave me a sweater and a stack of records.
 Thelonius Monk.
 Dave Brubeck with Gerry Mulligan.
 Lena Horne.
 Harry Belafonte singing blues.
 Though it might take him months to graduate, he said he was anxious to clean things out, to get prepared, ready to move.
 On the evening of Valentine’s Day, 1963, I stopped by his house and he showed me a sack half full of small candy hearts, with slogans like, “I love you” and “Hey, sweetheart.” He picked out a half dozen that asked, “Why not?” and gave me the rest of the bag, along with instructions for tomorrow at school.
 He said, “Give one to every girl who looks like she didn’t get a valentine.” I passed some around, though not half as many as Eric would have done.
 That was Friday.

Things moved rapidly now and the instructions came quickly.
 I was instructed to get as much incriminating conversation as I could, including the price, quantity and name of the drug; anything beyond that would be helpful but gravy.
 The main thing was to get the money for the drugs.
 Then I was shown the contents of a small white plastic bottle: One hundred Oxys poured into the officer’s hand.
 They were smaller than I thought they would be and an odd green color.
 He gathered the pills back into the bottle and handed them to me, telling me to put them in an easily accessible jacket pocket.
 The officers were all gathered around, but my focus was now entirely on the lead man, Officer White, the same undercover officer who had busted my son, had screwed up by giving Brandon the wrong phone number and with whom I had negotiated this deal.
 He was cocky and his ego always front and center, but I completely understood this demeanor.
 A person who does this for a living should have a high level of confidence, and that translates into what one might call “a strong personality.” I was listening as if my life depended on these men.

Revolutions of the past have been partial and localized negative reactions against an existing social order, and benefited only a small part of society that, in turn, blindly resisted change.
 They resulted in war and usually much destruction.
 The revolution of rising expectations is a positive, constructive movement spreading to encompass people at all levels of all societies around the globe, and pressing for the establishment of a higher social organization that can meet the expectations of all humanity.
 But the energies liberated by this revolution have to be properly converted into an evolutionary effort for development, otherwise they will fly off in unwanted directions.
 Society must provide the conditions and opportunities for these energies to express themselves positively and constructively in pursuit of their own fulfilment.
 Education is the most essential ingredient for this transformation.
 It is a great leveller of social hierarchy.
 It has the power to transform the propensity for violent revolution into ordered evolution.
 It can temper and mature aspirations and enlighten expectations by an under standing of what can reasonably be sought after and achieved.
 It can impart knowledge of opportunities, attitudes that support constructive initiative and skills for productive application.

 My eyes opened again to find Chevelle offering me a glass.

As it neared, he apprehended it ever more clearly.
 Two weeks or so he had spent gathering his treasures and giving them away.
 By two nights before the big day, he knew it would be something compared to which most crises meant nothing.
 Very likely, he believed it might be death.
 He told Kenny to leave Billy and me at home.
 In some way he wanted to spare us.
 I used to suppose he hadn't exactly known his motive, only felt that whatever was coming at him, we shouldn’t have to witness.
 The only sense I could make of it all was that something way beyond reason or observation took place in his heart, mind or spirit.

Across from him was Geriodon who was standing tall and ready in his Night Bronze armor.
 He looked to have gotten much more sleep than Rodregas, and of course, now he also had a minor Sigil of Healing.
 So what little advantage Rodregas might have had was no longer.
 Directly to Rodregas’ left stood the tall graceful figure of Nordien, he was as tall as Rodregas if not quite as muscular and his armor was spectacular.
 Geriodon had a full suit of Night Bronze armor which was plain and serviceable looking.
 Nordien’s armor was a work of art.
 His great helm had a purple feather sticking out the top and he had a short, matching cape coming out the back.
 Rodregas decided that he would go after Nordien first.
 He would make sure the favorite of Ambassador Van’dret would not win if nothing else.

He especially didn’t seem to think it was funny.

I don’t know what was wrong really.
 It was a song I’d written right before we went into the studio, so we’d never done it live—maybe that was the reason we struggled with it.
 But, the lyrics, you know, they’re a little complex: “I took my Melville out into the sun, what else could I do, I was in my twenties” it begins.
 Not exactly pop schmaltz,  you know, ABAB.
 It was a more complex rhythm to the whole speaking—and I did just sort of speak the lyrics—that was Jim.

The key to figuring this all out was to decide who could've helped us out.
 Nobody we'd known back in Minnesota could've strong-armed both the president of a bank and the mayor.
 Especially not from all the way back there.
 It had to be someone local, and they had to be either rich, powerful, or both.
 The answer was so obvious I felt like an idiot for not realizing who it was from the start.
 Who had I been told, almost from my first day here, were the two most influential families in Sanctuary?
 The Worthingfields and the Graveses.

 My being asked out had changed my treatment from almost every girl at school.
 Half the student body, the more sensible portion it seemed, had all decided that I was some kind of massively stuck-up slut.
 The other half had decided they needed to be my new best friend if they wanted to get invited to any of the cool parties ever again.

 My leaving Brandon's insane bouquet of flowers at the office instead of lugging it around all day should have helped.
 Apparently they all either thought it was a ploy, or were just too stupid to get the message that I didn't want to jump on the popularity bandwagon.
 Whatever the reason, I'd gotten three invitations to assorted parties or other activities before school ended.
 I even got another two as I hobbled back from the office with my roses, which had decreased during their stay there by exactly the number of office ladies.

The real challenge of development is developing people – not only in the external sense of providing them with food, clothing, good health and fresh water, but also in the inner sense of developing their awareness, attitudes, skills and values to make them more enlightened, productive and contented human beings.
 What we need today is fresh leadership in thought by our leaders to educate themselves and then the world about the opportunities of the third millennium, and then to take the actions to convert these possibilities into actualities.
 Developing our human resourcefulness is the single greatest need and opportunity of our time.
 Tapping Unutilized Resources
 Economic and social development strategies emphasize the strengthening of social capacity by building up physical infrastructure, production facilities and commercial organizations, and by creating a conducive environment for increasing economic activity through appropriate laws, fiscal, monetary and trade policies.
 Human development strategies focus on improving the welfare and capacities of the individual through better health, education, political choice and economic opportunity.
 Together they encompass the two basic components of all development personal and institutional, individual and collective.
 The challenge is to develop simultaneously both individual and social capacities and utilize their potentials in a complementary manner.
 For the individual, development involves acquisition of greater know ledge, more progressive attitudes, improved skills and higher values.
 For the collective, development involves establishment of more useful and productive institutions, systems, organizations and cultural values.

 Due to the diversity and complexity of the views examined by the Commission, and the heterogeneous mix of Commission members drawn from a wide range of countries, backgrounds and professions, it has not been possible to arrive at consensus on all the views discussed in this report.
 Five years of research and discussion have created a much greater commonality of perspective, but there are still significant differences among members regarding specific views and recommendations presented in this report.
 However, all the Commissioners agree with the basic emphasis on social and gender equity, job-led growth and human security.

A large number of rectangular tables were scattered about the room, situated so that the two people sitting at them would feel relatively isolated.
 As I continued my survey, I realized that there was only ever one pile of books at any given table, and in the few instances in which two people were sitting at a table, one of the individuals was obviously explaining something to the other one.
 Most of the kids looked fairly run-of-the-mill.
 There was even the expected contingent of jocks, obviously there just because a coach or parent had delivered some kind of ultimatum.
 Britney predictably headed over and staked out a table as close as she could get to a group of girls who were probably cheerleaders.
 Clustered around the other end of the room were the more studious kids, the kind who were generally pretty smart, but for whatever reason were struggling with math.

 Left to my own devices, I would've normally picked a table over on the nerd end of the room, but I found myself relating more to the girl stuck in the middle.
 She looked up and met my gaze for just a second before ducking back down and concentrating on her homework.

The park slowly came in view.
 It was a huge grass circle with a small play set in the middle covered in kids.
 The woods surrounded it except for the side that faced the street.
 A fountain was near the entrance along with a bike rack.
 That’s where we parked our bikes.
 I clicked the lock together and grabbed my bag.
 Emily was fumbling with her bike lock, which was old and rusted and usually refused to work without a fight.
 I walked over and tried to help her.
 “Why do you think Seth won’t tell us what he was doing?” I asked, watching her because she had refused to let me help.
 “Pride purposes?

Lisa had been dating a guy for years and I knew of him.
 He had attended our high school and he was the quarterback of the football team (my polar opposite).
 She had only come to the club the night I met her because she was angry with her boyfriend because he choose to spend Valentine’s Day with his brother playing basketball (take notes boys).
 She had called a friend who told her she could get her into this bar because she knew the bartender and they were both under legal drinking age.
 Lisa was 20.
 She was a “good girl” and hadn’t ever done anything like that.
 She had no intention of breaking up with her boyfriend.
 I looked her square in her beautiful blue eyes and I told her flatly, “You are going to fall so in love with me that you will not even remember this guy’s name!” We were married three years later.
 After all the years we have been married, I still think of that moment I saw her walk into that bar whenever we are having a tough time.
 It puts all my love right back where it belongs and nothing else matters.

Much of her magic was gone, but not all.
 Her hand brushed his, and a small shock of electricity crossed between them.
 The soldier instinctively pulled his hand back, giving Aurelia the opening she needed.
 She squirmed out from beneath, gripped her staff, and then whirled.
 The wood cracked against the back of his skull, knocking him against the wall just as hard.
 Blood splattered from his broken nose.
 “You’ll pay for—”

Repeatedly.
 I felt all kinds of defeated before we’d gone half an hour.
 After watching us for a while, Steed stepped in to save me.
 “Frey”—he’d converted to the nickname the others used in place of the sunnier ones—“why don’t you take a break for a while?
 Let us spar so you can watch.
 We’ll give you a few pointers.” I didn’t know if I liked the idea of the group sparring, whether it gave me a break from the torture or not, but Grey stepped forward and my opinion no longer mattered.
 “Just watch and learn.” I backed away and sat cross-legged on the ground.
 Ruby joined me; I could tell she was excited.
 It seemed everything excited Ruby.

And you will promise that in the name of the All-Father, or you will die at my hand.” Rodregas did not smile now, nor did they.
 “So you think you could kill all of us?
 Put your sword down now!” demanded Audrian.
 Rodregas stepped forward and buried just the tip of his right-handed short sword into Audrian’s chest, hitting the ribs but not shoving the blade through.
 Audrian gasped in surprise and fell back.
 “Swear you will keep my secret and you live, do not and you die.
 Choose!” Audrian just stood there looking at him.
 Then he nodded and said, “In the name of the All-Father, Lord of Sky and Earth and Water, I swear that I will keep your secrets.” Rodregas nodded and relaxed slightly; few would dare break a promise to the All-Father.

Cleo – And you’re not listening to me dear.
 Jim being a man, and inherently flawed for being so, is never going to realize that you love him.
 The only way that he might get it is if you let him know strait out how you feel.
 Liz – How?
 Just come out and tell him that I love him?
 Cleo – No Elizabeth, you tell him that you love him, and give him an instructional pamphlet with diagrams and small words, not too much in the way of color and shapes because he might get distracted and forget to read the text, not to mention ignore you when you’re exposing your deepest feelings.
 Liz – So your entire theory on men is that they’re complete imbeciles incapable of doing more than dressing themselves.

How could he respect a woman who would do something so silly?
 Restless now, Rick began wrapping up for the day.
 He’d been a junior vice president at Ward and Lee Realty since 2008, a position that involved a great deal of paperwork.
 Sometimes he missed spending the entire day visiting properties and dealing, but the behind-the-scenes work had its own challenges.
 Besides, on the occasions that he did the actual dealing, it was always a prime piece of real estate and clients who were rich or famous or both.
 Boston was a terrific place to be a realtor.
 Just after 7:00 Rick drove onto his own little bit of Boston in the Back Bay.
 He'd had his house built on a beautiful acre that was located on the southeast edge of the area inhabited by Boston's elite.
 Real estate prices there were outrageous, but Rick, with his connections and eye for property, had gotten this parcel for next to nothing.
 It was only a few blocks from the downtown area and considered too close for comfort by true members of the upper class.

 An hour before dawn, the city’s soldiers cornered and killed the last of the orcs.
 The Tun brothers were not there to watch, for they had snuck back to the outer wall at Qurrah’s insistence.
 “I know his plans,” Qurrah whispered as they stared across the open grass and the arrow-pierced orc bodies that covered it.
 “He is familiar to me, though I know him not.”
 “He isn’t your former master, is he?” Harruq asked as he adjusted his newly acquired swords.
 He had taken a belt and some sheathes from one of the dead bodies, but he was having a devil of a time getting them to fit correctly.

 He knew Korin should have more.
 He opened his shirt and, as he suspected, another purse hung from his neck.
 It was of flat leather and inside it were twelve pieces of silver and a small book.

I had put Thomas in a similar category as my biological Father, Richard.
 I considered that in both of their cases, nothing good seemed to happen when I associated with them so I just kept them out of my life and my family’s as well.
 The latest stories I had heard about Thomas were that while at one point he had escalated his abuse to injecting heroin, he then attended a drug rehab center called Narconon, which had apparently enabled him to be clean for the last couple of years.
 If this was true, and he was clean, maybe he’d be a good person to go to for help?
 My mother thought so, and she insisted that we reach out to him.
 We were obviously reluctant and for good reason, but we were also desperate.
 My mother insisted that Thomas’s last rehab stint at Narconon had worked for Thomas and she knew he had strong ties there and perhaps he could get Brandon in for treatment.
 She told us that Thomas was doing work for the rehab in the form of interventions and getting drug addicts into treatment and that was what Brandon needed.
 But at what price?
 I wasn’t as worried about the financial price at this point, but rather the thought of owing Thomas after all that he had perpetrated against us was almost as unpalatable as Brandon’s Oxy addiction.

But it made for interesting song material.
 I like some of the lyrics, which are a little plain, despite the ornate title of the song.
 CM:  	And, that’s just you and your guitar.
 BG:  	Right.
 Actually, recorded here at home, right over there, in the corner by the bookcases.
 I set up a mike in the corner, turned my back to the room, and used the wall of books as organic echo, a trick, I’m sure you know, that Robert Johnson employed to get his idiosyncratic vocal style.
 CM: 	No, I didn’t know that.
 BG:  	Oh, yeah.
 That’s the story, anyway,  He turned away from the engineer in the studio there and faced the corner, like Little Jack Horner—as a matter of fact, I almost called this “Little Jack Horner,” but it didn’t make much sense.
 Anyway, everyone thought the poor guy was just shy, or hiding his idiosyncratic playing style—which may be partly true—but the real reason, so I’ve read, is that he could get an interesting “bounce” from the corner, sort of double-tracking his voice before that was ever heard of.

 Maybe if you’re lucky, when historians decide to piece together what went wrong here, you won’t be blamed for what happened here.
 Liz – What do you mean?
 Why would I be blamed?
 Jim – Well you could be the beautiful lover who turned him to evil.
 Or the cold-hearted sister figure who abandoned him when he most needed you.
 Liz – Where would they get those ideas?
 Jim – They’re historians, they get those kind of ideas all the time.

I0m was a child. I had a little sister, Liz. She was an older sister. And she was a lot older than I was. So I had a lot of fun playing with her and learning about her, watching her grow up and grow up and grow up and grow up.<cls>

The top of the stairs had a small platform where two massive Immortal Guards stood.
 At first they showed no signs of movement, though Van’dret could feel their eyes on him as they weighed his right to enter the private solar of their master.
 In their full plate Night Bronze, the two guardsmen who stood perfectly still at full attention looked to be more statues than actual men, and something that was not beyond the magic of the man was whose door they guarded.
 The double doors leading to the private solar were also of Night Bronze, however the door was covered in intricate wards and symbols.
 The guardsmen's armor was less decorated and held only an engraving of their sigil animals.
 The guard on the right had an engraving on his Pauldrons, the piece of armor that protects his shoulders of the Celestial beast know as The Stag while the man on the left had an engraving of The Mastiff.
 After a moment, that seemed to stretch longer than was polite, the Immortal Guard to the right slowly nodded and with no hand touching it; the two massive doors opened to welcome him into the sanctum.
 Van’dret hurried through the open doors before the guard changed his mind.
 He normally found the sight of the Immortal Guards reassuring; the great sigil warriors were sworn to the protection of Immortalist, like himself, but he knew these two would cut him down like a common pauper if they sensed he was a danger to their Master.
 There was a short hallway leading from the doors with slim white columns on each side of the hallway, in between each column hung great pieces of art; paintings, sculptures and even a small wall hanging with amazing vibrant colors with a strange abstract design were all preserved in the space.

He turned the cart onto it, and after going down the path a bit he came across a good place to camp for the night.
 As Doi’van and Rodregas set up camp, Imeralda went back, doing her best to erase their tracks.
 After dinner they all took turns sleeping and keeping watch.
 Rodregas took the first watch and several times he thought he saw something.
 It was not the men they had left behind, but some animal that never came close.
 It seemed to be hanging on the edge of the camp.
 “A wolf maybe?” Rodregas thought.
 It seemed to be watching the camp, but it was not doing anything aggressive.
 He remembered thinking he had seen an animal during the fight.

“Velixar is dead,” Qurrah said, eyeing Aurelia warily.

 “You should have left them.
 He was an evil man.

Not until enough of the undead had been massacred.
 He readied his bow, his strong legs the only thing holding him to Sonowin.
 Three arrows pressed against the string of the bow, their tips dipped in holy water.
 His quiver, as was the quiver of every elf flying alongside him, contained water given to them by their clerics of Celestia.
 When their arrows bit into dead flesh, it would be like fire on a dry leaf.
 “Let no life lost this night be in vain!” Dieredon cried as they descended like a white river, raining arrows into the darkness.
 More than two hundred moving forms halted after that one pass, but a thousand more swayed in their sick, distracting dance.
 “One free pass,” Velixar said, observing the flight of elves as they swarmed overhead.
 They banked around, still in perfect formation, and then dove again.

Lightning struck around me, cracking the dark stones of the walls.
 Reed of Keithar Peak stood before me and suddenly I was on a pedestal, looking down as he wagged his tongue at me.

 I jolted awake, the smell of burning flesh still lingering in my senses, and was staring at Ruby’s ceiling.

 I was alone in her bed, but could hear an exchange of low whispers from the open door as she and Steed conversed in the front room.

My palms lit where they wrapped around her arms.

 She cocked one eyebrow at me.
 “Half fire fairy, silly.” And I flew through the air to land with a heavy thump a few yards away.
 “Well, it was a little unconventional, but at least you’re thinking on your feet,” she mused, straightening the material of her skirt.
 And then she giggled as she realized I was, in fact, not on my feet.

“No,” she said a little more clearly.

It was like the air had become thick, and although the fine strands of hair on the back of my neck hadn't moved, it felt like they should be standing on end.
 I heard indistinct sobbing, and then the voice returned and made me shiver.
 The sensation started somewhere on my back, and traveled forward like it was clawing to get out of my face.
 "I know you're sorry, just like you were sorry before.
 Only I don't really believe you, so we're instituting a new policy.

It felt light and a little awkward.
 Rodregas focused on his breathing.
 He had five targets and five arrows.
 He shot at the target shaped like a man.
 The arrow sailed over its right shoulder.
 Rodregas started to tense up, but knew that would kill any chances of hitting his next targets.
 He released the second arrow at the crouching man and the arrow hit low to the left, but he did hit the target.
 He nailed the next standard target almost in the middle, but missed the last two completely.
 Rodregas was among those who were first out of this round of the tournament and spent the rest of the day watching the archery competition.
 The only relief he felt was that only one of the other winners with the yellow ribbons on their arm also gained a second one.

Over the past two decades, total food production in Africa has grown at exactly the same rate as for the world as a whole, but high levels of population growth have resulted in declining availability of food per capita in many countries, particularly in the sub-Saharan region.
 This suggests that a grim outcome is not inevitable, if concerted action is taken now.
 Several factors have impeded achievement of higher agricultural growth rates in the region: political instability and civil unrest, poor macro-economic and agricultural policies, drought, and physical difficulties in farming in some areas.
 The ravages of war have had the most devastating effect, but inadequate and counter-productive policies have also had a major impact.
 Low mandated prices for agricultural products have acted as a disincentive to producers.
 State control of farm support systems, including marketing, transportation and input supply, is highly bureaucratic, inefficient, and, often, corrupt.
 Overvalued exchange rates encourage the import of low-priced farm products, depress local farm incomes, and make exports uncompetitive.
 Underdeveloped infrastructure results in high transport and marketing costs.
 The slow rate of technological development and diffusion have slowed growth in agricultural productivity.
 Irrigation potential is underdeveloped and poorly managed.

resources and land use are inadequate and uncontrolled, and the poor management of irrigation potential has been a major problem. The high prices for agricultural products have undermined the ability of the local farmers to grow and produce their own food and produce a variety of other food products and services.92m<eop>0m The agricultural<sep><cls>

Changing attitudes toward the environment have created entirely new industries and generated new jobs in every field where impact on the environment is of concern.
 New types of organization such as fast-food restaurants, franchising and hire purchase or leasing create new jobs by hastening the growth or expanding the activities of the society.
 Shifting attitudes toward marriage and the role of women create greater demand for jobs but also more opportunities for employment, because working women consume more and require additional services.
 Anxiety regarding the impact of technological development on jobs has been aggravated by the belief – largely a hangover from the Industrial Age – that in the industrial nations automation is rapidly replacing high-wage manufacturing jobs with low-wage jobs in the service sector.
 Actually, services have had a dominant place in Western economies for most of the twentieth century.
 In the United States, they now account for 79 per cent of all jobs, 74 per cent of GDP, and generate a $56 billion trade surplus, compared to a $132 billion deficit for goods.
 Technological developments, such as advances in computers, telecommunications and medical technology, have played at least as great a role in the growth of the service sector as in manufacturing.
 New service jobs in banking, foreign trade, research, design and engineering, computer software, education, health, law, finance, business management, communications, transportation, media and entertainment demand higher levels of education and skills and offer higher pay.
 In 1992 the median manufacturing job in the US paid only $19 per week more than the median job in the service sector.
 The growth of technology is freeing workers from the drudgery of the production line, while providing consumers with a quality of life previously available only to the most wealthy.

rowth of services have been a major factor in the rise92m of0m jobs in the service sector. In the last decade, services have generated about $1.6 billion in jobs, including a $2.2 billion growth in the service sector. In the same decade, businesses have generated about $1.6 billion in

Her reception was cool.
 Her name was Lisa and she was there to meet her friend who happened to be dating the bartender (who I knew well) so that was a good angle for me to work.
 I was doing pretty well getting to know her when a couple of girls I knew (and who I had hit on earlier) decided to have a little fun and disrupt my progress with this stunning lady.
 The two girls leaned in, their long dark hair flowing down and draping over each of my shoulders.
 They began whispering some very descriptive suggestions in my ears as they stroked their fingers through my hair.
 I can dual task with the best of them, but the offer I was getting in my ears conflicted with the vision across the table.
 I didn’t take my eyes off of Lisa but that wasn’t enough to keep the target of my affections seated while I was being propositioned by two beautiful brunettes.
 Lisa stood abruptly, looked rightfully angry and simply said, “It looks like you are busy,” and walked away.
 I thought my chances of getting her phone number were gone forever as she gathered up her girlfriend and left.

The lyrics.
 That’s what you really have to talk about, the lyrics.
 I don’t think anyone would claim any rock song is today’s “The Second Coming,” –except, maybe some critics who want to call Dylan our Dante.

Brandon also needed to be available to the narcotics officers to fulfill his end of a bargain he had struck with them during his brief incarceration.

 They wrestled him to the ground, cuffed him and began their search of him and his vehicle and, later, his house.

Infrastructure and production facilities have become a principal target of military action.
 Food supplies are frequently the first major casualty and most lethal weapon.
 A single explosion can paralyze a major metropolis or contaminate an entire region with toxic material, dwarfing the devastation caused by the industrial accidents at Chernobyl and Bhopal.
 The disruption of trade resulting even from regional conflicts such as the Gulf War or the war in Bosnia, impacts not only on the economies of the belligerents, but also on neighbours, trading partners and global economic performance.
 Neither the victor nor the victim can any longer afford to resolve conflicts violently.
 Political states may still be able to survive wars, but developmental achievements can not.
 So long as the benefits of development are confined to one or a few sections of society, the costs of militarization and war may not prevent economic and social progress.
 But when the need is to fulfil the rising expectations of the masses by extending the benefits of development to the entire society – thus enabling the society as a whole to move to the next higher level of collective affluence and fulfilment – every social resource must be garnered and harnessed for this purpose.
 The colossal cost of armaments and the catastrophic destruction of war are incompatible with the achievement of prosperity for all.
 Peace has become the fundamental imperative for development.

 My problem invites the question: how can I adore God when I don’t quite know what to make of him?
 I hear and read that he’s a person, and a spirit, who resides everywhere, outside and in us.
 I understand that if my imagination is too small to fathom God as a whole, which of course it is, I can grasp who God is by observing the qualities, nature, and actions of Christ.
 But though I have read, listened, prayed, and pondered about Jesus for dozens of years, in all honesty, given my definition, I can't claim to adore him either.
 Maybe if he were a woman, I could at least come closer to adoration, as I find women easier to adore.
 Not just for the pretty faces or figures, but for their gentler natures.
 Aside from my father and son, I can’t think of a man I have adored except Eric Curtis.

The women were varied as well, some thin and wiry, some stout like the males.
 Their hair was in all shades—light blond like the sun, brown as the trees, one even had rusty red, his plump cheeks peppered with light brown spots.
 And there were so many children!
 They were loud and ran round the camp all afternoon.
 And they were just as varied as the adults.
 I examined their wide noses, rounded ears, and stubby fingers.
 Those who wore no shoes had short, thick toes like trolls.
 The men had patches of hair curled on their chests and forearms and some even grew it around their chins like goats.
 Their clothes were tattered and ill-fitting rags.
 They moved about the camp slowly.

The two slipped out the front door and into the night.
 Upon arriving home, Harruq tossed the body into the far room, stripped off his gorgeous black armor, and plopped down onto the bed.
 “Night, Qurrah,” he said.
 “Sorry, but that elfie wore me out, and I never thought cleaning a place could be so tiring.
 I need to rest.”
 “Good night, then,” Qurrah replied, crawling onto his side of the uncomfortable bed.
 He curled his rags about him and drifted off to sleep, pleasant memories of the battle looping in his mind.

"Ms. Bellarose, please move up to Ms. Paige's old seat."
 Alec politely collected his note and led me to our seats.
 Any enjoyment I'd just experienced as a result of seeing one of my least-favorite teachers put in her place quickly soured as she started the class and launched into her usual barrage of questions designed to demonstrate my stupidity.
 Alec had apparently gotten under her skin even more than I'd realized.
 She abandoned her usual practice of stopping once I missed my first question, and instead continued to grill me, her smile growing each time I failed to answer something correctly.
 My earlier commitment to rededicate myself to school notwithstanding, the weekend hadn't exactly been conducive to mastering the intricacies of our latest subject.
 Her smile was wide indeed by the time the bell finally released me to flee in defeat and embarrassment.
 Alec paced me all the way back to my locker.
 "Is that normal for her?"
 I started to laugh, only to cut the motion short as I realized there was a better than even chance I'd end up crying instead.

 Yeah… Seth sat up quickly and looked around.
 He must have heard it too.
 The ground rumbled in the distance and I didn’t know if it was an earthquake or a stampede of elephants.
 “What’s going on?” I asked.
 Seth crawled back to the edge and I joined him.
 We peered over and I spotted a bunch of monsters stomping their way across the hills.

“What happened?” I finally choked out, but they were tight-lipped.
 “How do you feel?” Chevelle asked.
 His tone was off, a little shaky.
 I couldn’t tell if he was cross or something else.
 There was something so familiar about him, the way he leaned over me, but my thoughts weren’t working right yet.
 I tried to clear my head before answering.
 “I don’t know.” It was the best I could do.
 “Are you hurt?” “No.” He glanced at my hands, wrapped tightly around the neck of the container, and then back at me.
 “Do you know who I am?” Something about that was funny and I laughed, but it came out hoarse.

He hadn't considered the fact that the water hose would be a new toy for her.

 Smiling, he shook his head.

“Something must be wrong with me,” he said.
 “Shut up and start telling me more about yourself.”
 “Huh?”
 “Just do it.”
 So the half-orc shut up, paused, shrugged, and then began.
 “Well, this isn’t a happy tale, but it’s the only one I can think of.
 It’s about a present Qurrah gave me.

Words of power poured from her lips, and without hesitation the forest obeyed.

 More and more vines appeared, covering the half-orc’s arms and legs with green.
 They lifted him into the air, his boots dangling two feet above the ground.

 They went to bed early that night because they had to be at Paramount at 7:00 the next morning.

They say that Nordien carries your colors and is your champion.” Rodregas thought he saw the Ambassador’s eyebrow rise slowly, but there was no hesitation to his response.
 “As an Ambassador to the knighthood I, of course, have no favorites.
 Though as one who works to join the Celestials in the Heavens, I do have an abiding dislike for anything that smells of the Infernal.” His voice was smooth, very reasonable, and intolerably smug.
 Rodregas spoke before he could help himself, “Really?
 Because I heard that you and Taiga rather liked the smell of the Infernal.
 In fact, I heard that it smells very familiar to you.” Rodregas immediately felt ice in his belly; he knew his hint at such knowledge was enough to turn Van’dret fully against him.
 The Immortalist’s eyes blazed with fury and Rodregas had no problem thinking that the Infernal Realms were reflected in those cold eyes.
 Strangely, it was the one who looked the part of an Infernal Daemon that broke the tense moment.
 Doi’van casually stood up and said, “This is the best I can do with this shield and here is your lance.” The Hellborn promptly handed Rodregas the items.

Of my heart giving out.
 I remembered the faces my dad used to make as he fumbled in his pocket for his stash of nitroglycerin, with every muscle straining at once as if the strain was all that held him together.
 Panic attacks work like this: adrenalin kicks in when it has no business doing so.
 Because it’s so unwarranted, the fight or flight response it unleashes causes a paralyzing sort of fear, which spirals upward into what feels like the beginning of eternal torment.
 While under the spell of that malady, I came upon 1 John 4:18 in the King James version: “There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment.
 He that feareth is not made perfect in love.” I can testify that fear has torment, even that fear is torment.
 And since I suffered and recovered from panic attacks, I feel qualified to offer a remedy.
 Back then, I often read The Daily Word, which frequently repeated the message, “Let go and let God.” What we churchgoing folk might call surrender.
 Surrender is the remedy, at least for panic attacks.
 Maybe for everything.

 “It’s a rather odd spelling.”
 “Look at my brother’s name,” he said.
 Aurelia did, and then she saw what Harruq had also seen.
 “Your name is your brother’s, only backwards.”
 “Yup,” Harruq laughed.

Art – Was I really that out of it during the divorce?
 Gene cut his hair and actually wore nice clothing.
 I think I would have noticed that Jimbo, are you trying to pull one on me?
 Jim  - This all actually happened, and you were out of it, you forgot to pay the bills for three months, and if you recall you wouldn’t take the time to eat unless either Gene, Liz or I brought you something and nagged till you finished it.
 Art – Ah yes, food the fuel for life.
 It doesn’t seem all that important to eat when your world is falling apart.
 How long did it take for Gene to finally snap?
 Jim  - He started spending a lot of time hanging out at their church doing bible lessons.
 He actually applied himself to it, and was pretty good at debating the bible and other religious topics in just a couple of months.
 Gene turned Conservative Christian, it was kind of scary for several months.

When I opened them Alec's expression had moved from annoyance to sadness.
 I had a pair of heartbeats to wonder at the strange tricks my subconscious was playing on me, and then the dream started fading away.
 The heavenly surroundings were predictably the first thing to disappear, leaving afterimages of light burned into the corners of my vision.
 Alec was the next thing to go, but the memory of his features clung to my mind long after I found myself in a featureless void.
 Stranger still, his scent stayed with me even longer.
 I was just self-aware enough to hope I'd remember it all when I awoke in the morning.
 Chapter 5 It was a good thing I'd started school in the middle of the week.
 If I'd gone to school the next day after all the drama of learning about our mortgage problems I probably would have had a nervous breakdown.
 As it was, I was essentially worthless all weekend.
 I tried to warn Mom about the animals that'd mauled the kids from school, but she told me she was already aware of the incident and left before I could draw her into a discussion of what we should do about the bank.

“Yup I can.” “You’re always one step ahead.” “Always.” “So what do you think we should do?” Emily asked from my bed later on.
 I swallowed the bit of strawberry that had been in my mouth.
 “I don’t know, ambush them back?” “They might see that coming,” she pointed out, “and it’s really obvious.” “Well, they think we won’t do that because that is exactly what they would be expecting, so by actually doing it, we can trick them,” I rambled on and grabbed another strawberry.
 Emily tapped her lip with her pencil and straightened her pink pajamas.
 “I have no clue what you just said Jazell.” I laughed, “What I meant was that we should ambush them.
 Give them a piece of what they did to us.” Emily’s eyes lit up, “You mean use water guns…” “And water balloons…” I added.
 “And a trebuchet to launch the balloons!” Emily scribbled furiously on her paper.
 “I can build one easily.” “Sweet, but when do we do it?
 All four of us hang out every day.” “I can solve that problem.

We piled into it with plenty of room to spare.
 The bar was fully stocked, but Alec shook his head at Rachel when she made as if to reach for a drink.
 Nobody else seemed even the slightest bit interested in the prospect of alcohol.
 Rachel sat back with a pout and then turned and whispered in my ear.
 "Stupid shape shifters.
 None of them can get drunk, so they deprive the rest of us of the best parts of being young and stupid."
 Once we arrived at the park, I did my best to pretend obliviousness to all of the gasps and stares as we trickled out of the limo.
 It was a good thing Alec had such a steady arm, it was all I could do not to stumble as I took in the transformation that'd taken place.
 Our group glided up to the covered pavilion, surrounded in a pocket of silence as the rest of the crowd turned to see who'd just arrived.
 Alec produced tickets for all of us from a pocket somewhere while I was still taking in the sheer number of lights that'd been assembled for the occasion.

She was in a party scene, one of six people that formed a group with the star.
 She wasn't supposed to do anything but smile and sip her drink, but when the star gave her a smoldering glance during rehearsal, the director decided he wanted to film it.
 The result was a split-second close-up of her face, and the star kissed her hand.
 Marie felt as if she were going to burst from excitement.
 They were allowed to watch filming until lunch, and then they were given a tour of the rest of the studio.
 Marie heard obscenities and shouting, and she saw two different actors storm off two different sets in the middle of their scenes.
 But it was wonderful.
 The actors and actresses were very attractive people, and many of them were nice to her.
 "Today was magic, absolute magic," Marie sighed as they ate steak and salad that evening.
 Rick smiled.

Everybody who looked at home, we imagined had flopped in the Beat boarding houses Kerouac immortalized, or at least listened to the man speak his words in the Cellar, accompanied by a jazz riffing tenor sax.
 We overdosed on espresso.
 Then, as we climbed a hill to recover, I recited a jumble of lines I remembered from Ginsberg's Howl: "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix, wandered around and around at midnight in the railway yard wondering where to go, and loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking visionary Indian angels, and lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup, a hopeless task, and so took ship and disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving nothing behind but the shadow of dungarees and the larva and ash of poetry..." And I recited from On the Road about the children crying in Iowa where they let the children cry and where "the evening star must be drooping and spreading her sparkler dims on the prairie, which is just before the coming of complete night that blesses the earth, darkens the all rivers, cups the peaks and folds the final shore in."
 We explored every street and alley of North Beach and drifted into Chinatown, where I imagined us meeting two exquisite immigrant girls.
 I told Eric these beauties would plead for us to steal them away from the rich devil who had enslaved and brought them from China.
 We would conspire to snatch a suitcase full of cash from the rich devil.
 Then we would speed off toward the forests of Idaho to live in dissolute passion for a while.
 As always when my mind spilled over, Eric stood by me, often wearing a smile that hinted of love.
 Back in North Beach after midnight, a couple of Finochio’s transvestite dancers waylaid us.
 The four of us loitered under streetlamps listening to their pitch about the glories of San Francisco.

 But then he started kissing me so hard that my teeth cut into my lips, and I tried to push him away, but he wouldn't stop.

They're claiming I committed loan fraud.

 The move had been something I'd opposed and then ignored when my opposition hadn't made any difference.

It was possible, it turned out, to be rational but still completely paralyzed by indecision.
 The girl was sobbing now, and my heart felt like it was about to tear itself into pieces.
 The creak of the bathroom door opening should have been a relief.
 I was expecting the tension to evaporate once there were more witnesses.
 I couldn't have been more wrong.

“Is that what you want, why you are so intent on marrying me?

 A small crack in my stability let out enough magic to hurt him.

Me, the person who never won anything, was going to get to see the greatest musical of all time.
 I smiled and thanked everyone who yelled back congratulations, and then turned to find Alec staring at me.
 "Congratulations, Adriana.
 Les Misérables is one of the best.
 I hope you enjoy it."
 I thanked him sweetly, and even managed a smile, but I wanted to tell him he was a jerk.
 I'd been desperate to win a ticket, and he had to take yet another opportunity to rub in the fact that he'd already seen it.
 That he was rich enough to see it anywhere in the world as often as he wanted to.
 Even my desire to tell Alec off wasn't strong enough to overcome the pure joy at having won.

Unfortunately I wanted to spend time with Brandon even more than I wanted to avoid his friends, so there wasn't really a choice.
 "I'm fine, Mom.

 I'll spend the whole weekend lying around reading and studying.
 That should fix me right up."
 I gave Mom a wan smile, exactly the kind I used when I was really sick, and helped her finish packing.
 I wasn't sure whether I helped because I was feeling guilty, or because I was worried Brandon would show up before she'd left.
 Maybe I was just hoping to kill two birds with one stone.
 It wasn't until she was finally in the Jeep and backing down our lane that I finally stopped worrying that Brandon was going to pop around the corner.

 “What is it you wish to say to me?” the elf asked, ignoring the flailing hands that pawed at his face.

 Qurrah fell over onto his side, breathing as slowly as he could through the blood that filled his throat.
 The dead body of the elf crumpled in front of him, all of his hate-filled features gone from his face except for a single eye.
 The half-orc stared, wondering if his brother was truly dead.
 Darkness crept at the corner of his sight.

I just wanted this over and I had every expectation that it would be finished tonight and I could get on with my life and my son could get on with rehab and hopefully get healthy.
 Once I was un-wired I was able to call my wife who was a sobbing mess.
 Not hearing from me and the uncertainty of the night had taken its toll on her and my son.
 I headed home defeated and unsure if I would ever get the opportunity to complete the task that would free my son from a three to five year prison term.
 I was mentally exhausted and I didn’t know what my next move would be.
 All I knew is that the officers told me that if Ashley contacted me, I was to put her off until next week because they couldn’t put a crew together until the following Tuesday.
 Not only did I need to put humpty dumpty (the drug deal) back together again, I had to do it on a specific day at a specific time and in a county that the dealers clearly didn’t want anything to do with.
 It seemed to be an impossible set of circumstances which would need to simultaneously occur to accomplish my task, and oh yeah, I needed to do it without getting shot.

The flaming leather wrapped around the guard’s sword hand, charring flesh to bone as he screamed.
 The blade dropped as the guard held his blackened hand before him, bits of white bone catching the moonlight.
 “Mercy,” he begged, falling to his knees as the necromancer approached.
 “There is no such thing,” Qurrah said before magically hurling two pieces of bone through the man’s eyes.

 It occurs to me that Bryce and my wife may never forgive Brandon if something were to happen to me.

He loved her and desperately wanted to make love to her, and her response to him was passionate and unrestrained.
 But she was confused--he knew that.
 And he knew that she was a virgin.
 He'd felt her initial hesitation when he'd tried to coax her lips apart, felt the shock go through her body when his tongue had touched hers.
 The fact that she'd found the kiss exciting didn't change the fact that she was an innocent.
 Or that she was far from home.
 Or that she was engaged to another man.
 He had no qualms about wooing her away from her fiancé, but how could she be anything but confused when she couldn't even talk to the man?

 Larry came and sat with me in her room—he’s a bloke, man, a true spirit.
 He would come and sit with me, and, while we were watching over her—it was horrible, stomach cancer, and her heart was weak, I thought, shit, we’re losing her—anyway, Larry was there.

Reading some letters and reviews, I’ve seen just how dark I’ve gone.
 What you have just read is a slight alteration from my original manuscript.
 I have not changed the brothers’ actions.
 Instead, I have tried to show a bit more into their thoughts, their hearts, and their souls.
 I have had people call Harruq and Qurrah evil.
 Perhaps you agree.
 Much of what they have done certainly is evil.
 I will not sit here and justify the deaths of children, and to do so would paint me a psychopath and my characters sick beings.
 I view Velixar as sort of a recruiter, the kind of man who’d be right at home at a Nazi rally filling confused kids with bigotry, anger, and murder.
 He is gone, for now anyway, and in The Cost of Betrayal these two brothers will get a chance to live on their own.

 Rachel shook me gently, apparently not convinced I was mentally where I was supposed to be.
 "Britney's been telling people you collapsed yesterday after school.
 This makes twice in two days, and I know that yesterday wasn't the first time."
 The tired, dreamy remnants of my attack were suddenly burned away as I registered the meaning of what Rachel had just said.
 Vague suspicions that people had known about Jasmin's threats vanished, driven away by the truth that Britney had been gossiping about me just the way she gossiped about everyone else.
 Rachel grabbed my arm as I tensed up.
 "I don't know what you're going to do, but maybe you shouldn't get up yet."

Now, how this impacted my music, which was also coming, so to speak, is, on the simplest level, obvious.
 I wrote a sex song right away, of course.

 And then, on a deeper level, I think I began to understand the whole underpinnings of the music that held me in thrall—you know, the whole name—rock and roll—is sexual.
 And, of course, all the blues stuff from which rock sprang.
 It’s all sex, right?

Every weekend was filled with hours upon hours of yard work at Dino’s command.
 If we ran out of work to do, Dino would have us move a scrap woodpile from one end of the backyard to another, then back again if he wasn’t done with us.
 Sometimes Dino would stand in the backyard and direct us with a garden hose nozzle, spraying us from one chore to the next.
 Dino was sick.
 We never knew when we were going to get knocked across the room.
 We were often treated like unwanted animals.
 We wondered why this was happening to us but at the same time we wondered if the same thing was happening in the families across the street.
 Our half-brother, Harry (named after Dino’s father) was soon born.
 Then, my stepfather had even less regard for us as we were now second-class citizens to his “real” son.

Rodregas reached up and touched his face.
 “Dear Gods,” he thought in amazement, “the trigger words had worked.” He had done what he had learned to despise and hate most of all; he had switched into the body of an innocent man.
 “I am an Immortalist,” thought Rodregas in dismay.
 It had been his only shot at survival, and the young man had already been dead in all ways that mattered, but still it was an act of incredible repugnance to him.
 He thought, “Once again I have done what I needed to survive.” As Rodregas lay on the floor he looked up at the stars and the looming figure of the captain.
 He had to think quickly.
 It was instant death for anyone to interfere with an Immortalist Ascension ceremony.
 It was the most stringent rule enforced by the Guild of the Celestial Path, and therefore the most enforced rule in the Eastern Realm.
 “Ah, thank you Captain, I am fine,” Rodregas said.
 He instantly realized the captain would know that all was not well.

Stone houses in the night, the glare of fire glinting off the rock.
 Massive stones rising high above.
 Dark leather, tight against my skin.
 Cloaks flowing in the wind, forming a circle and then massing together, threatening.
 Black hair glistening with sweat in the moonlight and rolling in rhythm as the horse ran, its mane rocking hypnotically with the motion.
 Its heavy equine smell, so unlike any other.
 I clung to Chevelle’s strong back as we rode at full speed.
 The wind and rain cut at my face, my eyes sore, cheeks streaked with tears and ash.

"The gentlemen have at long last arrived."
 Isaac was the first one through the door, looking particularly 007 in a tux that amazingly enough had the occasional silver thread that matched perfectly with Jessica's dress.
 I looked up from his outfit just in time to see a flash of concern melt away into relief.
 I had just a moment to wonder at the novelty of Isaac showing that much emotion all at one time, and then James stalked through the door in a tux that was so cutting edge, that I wasn't sure if there was anything else like it anywhere in the States.
 The shimmery nature of the fabric combined with an unusually angular, sharp cut to make it different than anything else I'd ever seen.
 I worked my way up from the blindingly-polished black shoes, to the splash of deep red peeking out of his chest pocket, and somewhere along the way decided I loved the tux.
 As amazing as James' and Isaac's tuxes were, I was already looking past them, craning my neck to see down the hall in a vain effort to catch a glimpse of Alec.
 There was no reason for my heart to be pounding away so furiously in my chest, but unlikely or not, my body at least seemed convinced he was going to change his mind and leave me standing here by myself.

Over the last few years, democratization has been especially dynamic in Africa, where it has been dubbed Africa’s Second Liberation.
 During the first three decades of post-colonial independence, almost all of the continent’s 54 states had come under either single-party or military rule.
 The preference for authoritarian rule was often justified by the need for rapid economic development, which could be impeded by opposition to government policies and by the need to contain regional and tribal conflicts.
 Neither of these claims has proven true.
 Living standards have actually declined in most African countries during the last two decades.
 Regional and tribal politics have flourished.
 Dozens of civil and inter-state wars have been fought, accounting for millions of lost lives.
 Food production and employment have lagged far behind population growth.
 In the absence of legal channels of protest, opposition parties have frequently resorted to violence.
 By the end of the 1980s the lack of material progress and the emergence of young educated professionals in leadership positions had fostered, on the one hand, a revolt against single-party rule and, on the other, popular pressure for multi-party democracy that have together resulted in a democratic domino effect, similar to the spread of communist rule which Western democracies had feared would overwhelm South Asia twenty years ago.

Meanwhile, I’m on Hounddog Records, ironically, an L.A. outfit.

Qurrah withdrew a few pieces of bone from a pouch.
 He tightened his grip about them, whispering a few words of magic as he did.
 Then he looked to the window.
 He could barely see a bow and part of a hand.
 Qurrah waited.
 The Neldaren warriors charged, hoping to overwhelm their opponents before arrows took them all.
 The elf in the window leaned out to unleash a killing strike, but it was Qurrah who did the killing.
 Four pieces of bone leapt from his hand.
 They hit the elf’s neck and temple, making a satisfying crack.
 The archer spilled through the window and landed with a clattering thud.

The popular and some times violent demand for freedom and participatory democracy, the return of religion in politics, surging ethno-nationalism and intolerance, and rising urban crime are disparate expressions of this phenomenon.
 In Eastern Europe, where a peaceful revolution from within has broken the shackles of statism that long confined the energies of people, these energies now surge forward in high and eager expectations of a better life.
 Already there are growing signs of impatience, disappointment and frustration arising from the greater hardships that have come in place of the greater benefits that all expected.
 It is essential that these energies be channelled into constructive pursuits that generate tangible improvements.
 Otherwise they may recoil from the effort and look backwards to a failed system or be guided by false prophets on a path that once again poses a threat to other nations.
 The phenomenon of growing violence in an age of increasing affluence seems to contradict the thesis that poverty is one of the major causes of violence, until we realize that the increasingly visible signs of prosperity the world over raise the expectations and aggravate the sense of deprivation and revolt among those that have been by-passed by the general progress.
 Greater political and social freedom can only further magnify this tendency.
 This suggests that violence at the international, national and community levels cannot and will not be eradicated before poverty itself has been abolished, and that, if poverty is left unaddressed at its source, further economic progress is likely further to aggravate conflict in society, unless we are able to extend the benefits of progress to everyone.
 This realization would be quite disconcerting were it not for the fact that we are fast approaching the time when both these persistent ills of humankind can be banished forever – the way slavery and colonialism were banished in the past.
 The recognition that it is neither desirable nor possible to go backwards adds urgency to our efforts to move forward.

o stop this92m 0m-- and we have to stop this -- we must begin to address the underlying causes of this violence. It is not only poverty that is causing the rising violence. It is also the economic and social problems that are causing the rising violence.<eop><eod> I am<sep><cls>

It looked like a carbon copy of the room I was in before but it was further down the hall.
 Officer White connected a recording device to my crack-berry and I was told to place the call and get Ashley to engage in conversation that would be incriminating.
 I was to get her to use the word “Oxy” and discuss the price and the quantity and to get Ashley to acknowledge that the price was “$2500 cash for the one hundred Oxys.” I placed the call, nervous and anxious to be sure to get what the police wanted.
 To my shock, the recording on Ashley’s phone stated it was no longer in service.
 The officer was obviously disappointed and suggested that perhaps they caught on to the scheme, as they were very savvy.
 Just as he was rambling on how difficult it was to get someone to deal with you.

he would have thought that most 22 year olds in the 1920s would be married.
 Especially a girl as beautiful as this one.
 But Tranton was her family name, so she apparently wasn’t.
 Scanning the text on the page opposite the picture, he found a little information about her.
 She’d gotten married at 23—a year after the picture had been taken.
 And she’d died in 1941.
 So young!
 She’d been only 37.
 Wondering what she’d died of, he turned the page and found more information about her.

Alec stood motionless for a pair of seconds, and then seemed to explode and melt back into himself.
 I blinked, and his human body had been replaced with the hybrid form that'd saved my life once before.
 Only this time he wasn't fighting wolves, he was fighting another hybrid, and Brandon towered over him.
 There was another ripple of movement on the other side of the light.
 Jasmin and Dom both pulled away from me, joining the other three, facing outward in preparation for the inevitable attack.
 Vincent's dark form inched slightly closer, but Brandon's growl froze his henchman in place.
 The complete stillness that resulted was suddenly shattered by a flash of heat lightning off to the east, and when the spots cleared from my vision, the two hybrids were a blur of motion.
 Merely human eyes never could've hoped to follow all of the action.
 I got the feeling Alec's technique was superior.
 He moved from spot to spot, motion to motion with the smooth economy of a tree bending before the wind, but if he was a tree, Brandon was the hurricane.

 Apparently he'd decided against the truth option.
 "I looked unhappy today?
 You, who never crack a smile unless you're going to get something out of it, were concerned about the fact I wasn't all smiles and giggles?
 Maybe you should flunk a test or two.
 Only it doesn't really count unless your dad, you know, the one who used to make your birthdays really special, is gone."
 Alec's mouth opened, closed, and then assumed its normal place in his unreadable mask.
 He reached out, almost consolingly, but I stepped away before he could make contact.
 I knew I should shut up before I said something really unreasonable, but my anger was in the driver's seat now.

The tension grew.
 A group of men, not daring to admit where their pay came from, built sturdy palisades between the two halves of town.
 Everyone knew why but none spoke of it, at least outside of a whisper.
 Two weeks after Harruq and Qurrah had slaughtered the messenger from Veldaren, the burning lights of an army encampment filled the fields north of Woodhaven.
 Soldiers of Neldar had arrived.

 It always seemed like the kids who moved in partway through the year usually had some kind of instant in with the cool crowd, but that probably wouldn't happen for me.
 It wasn't that I didn't want to make friends; I just wasn't very good at it.
 My equilibrium seemed to have returned, so I took a few unsteady steps around to the back of the truck.
 If I didn't return with a box soon Mom would rush out expecting the worst.
 Unless she got caught up visualizing some new project, in which case it would be hours before she thought to come check on me.
 We'd moved the beds and most of the other heavy items in earlier, which helped explain my exhaustion, but that didn't make the pile of remaining items in the back of the truck any less foreboding.

If you develop good foot work and keep them moving and you keep your center of gravity low, you can win against stronger but less-disciplined fighters.” They both nodded, for the moment convinced.
 “Now watch and try to learn this basic form.” Rodregas stepped into position; his knees deeply bent, his hands loose but raised just below his shoulders.
 He stepped forward and raised his left arm in a sweeping block and then he took another step and struck out in a swift blow to an imagined attacker with his right hand.
 While he followed a set form in his mind, he also saw his invisible attacker and he struck like he was really there, his blow stopping only when they met the invisible attacker’s form.
 After sharing a few basic blocks and strikes, he stopped and faced the other two again, and said, “Now, I will repeat that and then you two can take a turn.” Learning to fight through mastering one’s own form was new to both, and they struggled to follow his example.
 Doi’van often over reached any possible opponent, while Imeralda’s movements had little of real strength or violence behind them.

For the first time in I don’t know how long, I was out of the castle.
 Free from practice, free from duties, free from walls.
 Though tricky to set up, the spell worked on Rune.
 I showed up at practice early and whispered the words in case something went wrong and he heard.
 I can’t imagine what my punishment would have been, though it might have been worth it.
 He fell asleep quickly and I ran as fast as I could, my pulse pounding with excitement.

The weight of blood was on his shoulders, and who was he to fight against it?
 “I’m sorry if I’m weak,” Harruq whispered to his sleeping brother.
 “I can’t be like you.
 I can’t be strong like you…”
 The half-orc buckled the old pair of swords next to the gleaming black blades on his belt.
 He then gently took his brother into his arms and carried him back to town.
 The weight of his brother in his hands was a feather compared to the burden on his heart.

Mom had given up trying to help me with homework about the time I turned twelve, so she kept telling me to just read the book and figure out what they were doing in the examples.

One hundred and twenty-six nations have voted for the resolution.
 It is ironic that the opposition to this resolution and justification for the continued possession and possible use of nuclear weapons come solely from the most militarily, politically and economically powerful group of nations, which are militarily without adversary and at the same time in the best position to afford and institute alternative means for their national security.
 Here lies the real key: the insistence of the few most powerful nations on perceiving security in their own terms, and their insatiable urge to achieve ever more of it for themselves at the expense of greater insecurity for others and the world as a whole, even though their goal can never be achieved on this unilateral basis.
 During the Cold War, nuclear weapons were legitimized by the five permanent members of the Security Council which are the nuclear weapon states.
 Now that it is over, the governments of these nations seek to justify continued possession and the option to use these weapons, even while exerting every possible pressure to stop proliferation to other countries.
 The very logic which the nuclear weapon states rely on to support this policy, however, makes the acquisition of these weapons extremely attractive to non-nuclear powers.
 So long as their possession and possible use is tolerated and justified, the relatively low cost of production and high threat potential of these weapons offer strong incentives for other states to acquire them.
 It is unrealistic to expect that any system of international controls or inspections can prevent their eventual acquisition by states that decide to develop them and have the advanced scientific capabilities to do so.
 From the inception of nuclear weapons, two things have been clear.
 There can be no victors in a nuclear war and there is no credible defence against these weapons.

int that it is possible to use nuclear weapons to achieve a certain degree92m of0m proliferation, the international community has been very supportive of this policy. They are not the only one.

 The sound that came out of my mouth was disturbingly close to a squeal, but I was too excited to care.
 I waved goodbye as I stood and headed towards the doors.
 Amazingly enough, there was already a line in the office by the time I got there.
 Either the nerds who liked musicals didn't actually eat in the lunchroom, or some of the people who maintained a cool, disinterested facade actually wanted to see it.
 My enthusiasm ebbed lower and lower as I waited in line behind a number of people who it turned out didn't even want to see the show, but figured that this would be a great chance to get away from their parents for the better part of twelve hours.
 By the time I signed my name to a brightly-colored pink slip of paper, dropped it into the box, and walked out past the ridiculously-long line of people still waiting to enter the drawing, I knew for a certainty that I wasn't going.
 They'd posted the cost of the tickets, and I'd been right.

“How long?” Qurrah asked as he lurched onto his feet.
 “Not long,” Harruq said, holding Qurrah’s shoulder to steady him.

 As if on cue, they heard a collective roar from the south.
 Harruq glanced at the stairs along the wall, but Qurrah saw this and shook his head.

She kept all the things I wasn’t allowed to touch in that room; it was supposed to be off limits.
 Not that I’d bothered trying much, because there was a large flat stone—covering where it hid in the floor—that I’d never been able to move.
 But that was before.
 I wasn’t sure how the magic had worked with the bird, but I knew it had, so I dropped to my knees, held my hands above the stone, and closed my eyes, concentrating with everything I had.
 Nothing happened right away, and my mind wandered a bit with thoughts of what might be inside, how I wanted to see and needed to touch my family heirlooms.
 The things that belonged to my mother.
 The stone lid scraped across the floor as it shifted.
 It didn’t go far, but I hadn’t needed much.

Alec was probably going to die, and all of the rest of us with him, but if he didn't, if the pack somehow managed to survive the coming crisis, I wanted to be there.
 Alec was more than capable of sending me away and then never letting me know he'd survived.
 There was a constant war inside him over what to do with me and I couldn't afford to give up my one advantage.
 He seemed less able to contemplate cutting me out of his life when I was around.
 I planned on playing that card for all it was worth.
 I was staying and that was it.
 Alec sighed, presumably in resignation, and then suddenly my legs were thrown up in front of me as he picked me up with inhuman speed.
 Only the steady pressure of Alec's arm around my waist kept me from screaming, and then I was back on my feet, and being carefully, but firmly shoved through a tangled knot of bodies.
 My shoes had never been intended to allow ankles to withstand that kind of punishment.

Burrowing deep in a briar patch, struggling to catch my breath, I wrenched the wad of papers from under my shirt, buried them in the soil beside me, and then waited for my punishment to come.

 They had magic—they were High Council.

In place of free market conditions, organized crime and corruption became rampant.
 In seeking to reject thoroughly the authoritarian form of government that suppressed the rights of the people, many of these countries allowed the power and authority of their central governments to de cline to the point where they could no longer enforce conditions needed for operation of either a command economy or a free market system.
 The power of government in the West may be veiled by the fact that its laws are usually obeyed without the need for exercise of force, but the threat of enforcement is as real for tax evaders in North America as it was for free marketers under the communist regime in USSR.
 Regardless of the system, strong government is a prerequisite for a strong economy.
 The experience of the past few years has clearly demonstrated that the state must play a very active role in order to bring about a smooth and rapid transition and this role cannot be limited purely to regulation of the market.
 Intervention will also be necessary in the form of central planning and industrial policy, at least during the transition period.
 The radical restructuring of entire industries – defence, agriculture, aluminium, steel – is too complex and massive an undertaking to be made the responsibility of market forces and individual firms.
 7.Agriculture has to be given a special status: For reasons discussed in the previous chapter, the state has an especially important role in the regulation of agriculture.
 After the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, the rise of free market and free trade polemics generated considerable confusion regarding the necessity and legitimacy of state regulation and intervention in protecting and preserving agriculture, which is the beneficiary of innumerable subsidies and supports in virtually every industrialized nation.
 It is ironic that advice coming from overseas almost invariably recommended eliminating sup ports to this critical sector of the economy.

Chevelle pushed harder, assaulting me with faster and stronger swings.
 I was able to defend myself if I focused.
 Murmurs of approval floated in from our audience.
 I enjoyed that more than I probably should have.
 I concentrated hard and began throwing a few good hits of my own in with the blocks.
 Our swords clashed repeatedly, neither of us hitting the mark.
 I was certain he could have, but confident I was blocking well.
 We continued until I became winded, then Chevelle lowered his blade, smiling with approval.

For he and his brother, that was life.
 What the abyss was he doing asking for work?
 A swelling of nerves in his gut almost forced him to leave.
 Several men in front of him turned away, dejected or angry.
 He didn’t hear the reasons why and didn’t want to know.
 The idea of so much money, more than enough to buy warm food and clean drink, kept him there.
 At last it was his turn, and he approached the table where Alvrik sat chewing on a piece of bone long since void of meat.

Ruby’s red curls gave her away.
 She had tossed back the hood of her cloak and was laughing with a large elf.

 One was about the size of Steed; the other was thinner and appeared fidgety, even in the darkness.

Taking in a deep breath, Qurrah pooled his strength and focused on the skull taunting his brother, visualizing the thread and seeking to sever it.
 There was a pull on his chest—the taste of copper on his tongue.
 When he opened his eyes, the skull fell to the battlements.
 The jaw snapped and rotting teeth clattered to the streets below.
 “You did it!” Harruq picked up the skull, frowning at its ordinariness.
 Shrugging, he flung it toward the distant army of orcs.
 “Not done yet,” Qurrah said, sweat lining his face, his breathing soft and ragged.

 All was identical to his dreams.
 A mile from town, he saw the hill, a smoldering fire atop it to guide his way.

 “Say the words,” the man in the black robe ordered.

The pre-existent conditions, the starting point of the transition, the timing, speed and extent of the reforms introduced during the past five years varied considerably among the 25 nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
 But, with few exceptions, they were founded on the same general principles and on the policy recommendations of Western proponents of rapid transformation to total free-market liberal capitalism, based on a simultaneous shock strategy encompassing macro-economic stabilization, prices and property rights.
 Western governments and the international financial institutions, led by the IMF, strongly advocated this approach and linked financial assistance to its adoption.
 The strategy called for rapid deregulation of prices, privatization of farms and industry, introduction of a convertible currency, and balancing the budget to reduce the high fiscal deficits, primarily by reducing military expenditure and subsidies to producers and consumers.
 The assumption was that a programme with these elements would result in a significant increase in production, efficiency and the availability of consumer goods within a short time.
 The actual results were quite contrary to the expectations of these countries’ Western economic advisers, as well as to the governments and people of the region.
 The initial phase of reforms had a disastrous impact on the economies, on the people and in some countries on peace and political stability.
 From 1990 to 1993 production in all 25 nations declined drastically, from a minimum of 10 per cent in Poland, 20 percent in Hungary and 22 per cent in the Czech Republic to a maximum of 45 per cent in Russia, 57 per cent in Latvia and 75 per cent in Armenia.
 Investment fell by an average rate of 13 –14 per cent per year from 1990 to 1992, and by a three-year total of more than 50 per cent in Russia.
 The fall in real incomes followed that of output, and the impact was made even more severe, especially for pensioners, by the simultaneous dismantling of the vast social support system and dramatic increase in the cost of essential consumer goods.

forms began in the first half of the year 1990, and began in the second half of that year. The first phase of the reforms was a major disaster for the economy and92m the0m people of Eastern Europe. It was a disaster for the development of the region and the development of the people of<sep><cls>

I tripped just before I hit the first step, and almost went crashing down the flight that led to the basement.
 Luckily I was just quick enough to grab the banister and save myself from a broken neck.
 I didn't quite manage to avoid twisting my ankle though, so I limped all the way up to the second floor.
 Trying to be as casual as possible, I looked into the art room as I hobbled by, but they'd rearranged their stations, and someone's easel was in the way now.
 The sprained ankle had slowed me down enough that there was no way I was going to make it back to my locker before the bell rang.
 Still, I tried to be gracious when it went off just as I handed Mrs. North the papers.
 Based on the number of classrooms on the second floor, and the narrowness of the stairs, there was no point in trying to wait the crowd out.
 I gritted my teeth and limped out into the surge of bodies.
 Surprisingly enough, there were more familiar faces than expected.
 As I grabbed the handrail on the right, I noticed Isaac several feet ahead of me.

 It took the sting out of the words that were probably just for the people close enough to overhear.
 "Don't you worry, Miss Paige, I'll let you know when I don't think you're keeping up.
 Seeing as you are done though, would you please run something over to Mrs. North?
 I'd do it, but I need to go to a special projects meeting today during lunch."
 As quickly as that, my books were in my backpack and I was on my way to the second story of the school, which housed music, sketching, and all the other forms of art lesser mortals like me would never master.

One afternoon, I called Thomas and a strange voice picked up the phone.
 I asked for Thomas and the person on the phone said, “He is unavailable right now, but tell me what you want and I will get it ready for you to pick up.” It was obviously a cop, and I knew my brother was probably sitting there in handcuffs while they set up every idiot who called for drugs, then collected them like goldfish as they swam into the net.
 I called my mother and told her I thought Thomas had been busted; time would confirm he had.
 Everyone knew what he was doing, including my mother, but she just didn’t want to admit it to herself, and there was nothing she could do to stop it anyway.
 Later, I watched the evening news and saw reporters standing outside Thomas’s house announcing a record cocaine bust.
 Thomas was sentenced to several years in a federal penitentiary in Texas.
 He would have spent far more time if he hadn’t set up his dealer, who was an even bigger fish in the drug world.
 One of the hardest things I have ever done is accompany my mother to Texas to visit her son, my brother Thomas, in prison.
 Over the years I have seen her strive to survive situations no person should ever be subjected to, but this visit crushed her.

Although the problem of unemployment is not new, a variety of factors have combined to aggravate the difficulties confronting most regions of the world in recent years.
 As a result of the decline of global military spending by one-third in real terms since 1988, employment in defence industries has fallen steeply and is expected to decline by at least 3 to 4 million jobs or roughly 25 per cent by 1998.
 In addition, 4.5 million military personnel will be demobilized during this period.
 The break-up of COMECON and the USSR have had a strongly negative impact on trade within Eastern Europe and with the industrialized West and developing countries.
 The relatively high interest rates in Europe, resulting in part from tight monetary policies pursued by Germany to offset the enormous costs of reunification, have had adverse effects on investment, growth and employment in the region.
 More recent rate increases in the US threaten to halt the declining trend in unemployment observed over the past year.
 The extreme disruption of the centrally planned economies of Eastern Europe during the early stages of their transition to market economies has led to high domestic unemployment in most cases.
 Slow recovery from the recent global recession has restrained the growth of foreign trade.
 Down-sizing by major corporations in response to intense competitive pressures has eliminated many jobs which are not being restored, even after the recession is over.
 Privatization and restructuring of public sector companies in response to fiscal pressures has had a similar effect.

Rachel hugged me from one side while Dominic placed a gentle, dark hand on my other shoulder, and then we were off.
 Brandon, and what must have amounted to his entire pack, were waiting for us just off school property.
 The two leaders faced off as everyone else fanned out around them.

 Silently groaning at my fashion faux pas, I located a sign pointing towards the office, and slipped around a couple of jocks who paused in their manly mock boxing match just long enough to check out the new girl.

In place of his study hall, Eric worked as an office monitor, picking up attendance sheets and delivering hall passes.
 Laura was the other first-period office monitor.
 They skipped down the halls, holding hands and laughing.
 Laura held classroom doors open.
 Eric swooped in with his arms extended like wings, softly humming the Hallelujah chorus from Handel’s Messiah.
 Sunday Kemper was Lane Campbell's new girl.
 She lived a block from our school.
 Her folks either enjoyed our company or preferred to have their daughter at home even if she brought the whole gang with her.
 Their family room had a pool table and a stereo.
 While most of us played eight-ball or listened to Sunday’s dad, Ivan, an engineer, explain how things worked, Eric listened to the Messiah.

I had to just play it cool and leave or risk looking like a total loser.
 He returned my wave with a nod and shifted his focus back to whoever was on the phone with him.
 Brandon had parked on the opposite end of the parking lot from where he normally did.
 Presumably it was because all of the good spots in his normal area had been snatched up by people who weren't running quite as late as us.
 I was halfway to the closest door before I remembered that it was still closed as a result of the mysterious 'potato gun rampage' as everyone had started calling it.
 A normal person, one who was really as self-confident as I pretended to be, would have just turned and headed towards the eastern set of doors.
 Not wanting to look like a ditzy blonde who couldn't even remember that someone had run a SUV into the flagpole and temporarily rendered one of the four main exits inoperable, I kept walking.
 The school was narrower than it was long.
 I could walk around the west end, and use the closest doors on the north side, and still have plenty of time to get to my locker before Biology started.
 I was busy replaying my conversation with Brandon as I walked around the corner of the building.

My backpack was slung over my shoulder, filled with my writing books and sketchpads.
 I kept my eyes on the shadowed road, watching my every step.
 Usually I was more aware of my surroundings, but today I was tired and didn’t care if I rammed into a tree.
 I kicked a rock into the grass.
 The sun was starting to set, painting the sky in brilliant oranges and reds.
 It slipped down the sky, allowing the first stars to peek out from behind the bright curtain.
 The remaining light cast shadows over everything, creating the illusion that there was double of everything.
 The world prepared to go into its hours of unreal silence that made it seem magical, and it really was.
 My phone buzzed and I awoke from my trance.
 I thumbed the keypad and opened the message Seth had sent me.

 Her throat tightened, and she pulled her chin free, shaking her head.

 She gripped his hands.

My gaze moved between the sizeable carcass and her lithe form.
 “I’ll be traveling fast and far and don’t intend to stop and hunt.
 I will pack the extra with me.” I managed a sheepish smile.
 It seemed like I needed things explained a lot lately.
 “Where will you go?” “Back to the village.” “To council?” I breathed.
 “They sent you to find me?” Her bright blue eyes flicked to Chevelle and back.
 “No, Freya.
 They will not know I saw you.” “They are looking for me?” Terror crept into my voice.
 I was Chevelle’s captive, but he’d given me some sort of reprieve.

Unless it'd been blocked by something.
 But if so I would have drawn whatever it was that'd been in the foreground.
 I was even worse than normal when it came to drawing people or animals, but I had a good memory for everything else.
 I pushed the notepad away in frustration, and then started shaking as I finally recognized my drawing.
 It was the grotto from my dream, and the reason I hadn't filled in the center was that I'd never seen it.
 That was the spot where Alec had been standing.
 Chapter 13 Morning came not a moment too soon after a night filled with tossing and turning.
 Every time I nodded off, I awoke a few minutes later, my mind reaching for something that wasn't there, only to snap back as it didn't find what it was looking for.

Even I could tell that I wasn't doing a very good job pretending I believed him.
 Alec recaptured one of my hands in his, and then leaned back, lazily exuding confidence.
 "It's okay that you don't believe me yet, I'm equal to the challenge of convincing you."
 He smiled at my shrug, but now that we weren't arguing about the inevitable fact he was eventually going to leave me, my mind was free to start working again.
 "Don't do what?"
 For the first time ever, I'd managed to catch him by surprise.
 It took him several seconds to figure out what I was talking about.
 "Your hands, you tend to talk with them when you're excited or angry, and it's very distracting.
 I mean for us.
 All of the motion results in a hundred tiny signals flooding my brain as my instincts try to decide whether you're prey to be chased, or a bigger predator that I need to flee from."

Medical biotechnology is opening up the prospect of longer, healthier lives of better quality for the elderly.
 Over the next 40 years, child mortality is expected to fall to half its present level and life expectancy is projected to rise by 10 per cent.
 The shift to renewable energy sources and reduced material consumption in manufacturing can lighten the environmental burden of economic growth.
 Concerted action now could bring these benefits much sooner.
 Information superhighways: Information is a catalyst and stimulant to social development.
 The speed of information, like the speed of transportation, is a critical determinant of economic activity.
 Innovations brought about by the marriage of computers and telecommunications will make possible more, faster and better communication in developing countries at substantially lower cost through global computer networks and satellite-linked telephone systems.
 In some areas, such as finance, news and sports, the barriers to the flow of information are already crumbling.
 The increasing quality, quantity and speed of information flows about markets, technologies and significant events are quickening growth of the global economy.
 One consequence has been the globalization of financial markets, resulting in increased financial transfers to developing countries.

I don't mind you being here.
 I'm sorry I had to leave you alone for so long, it was inexcusable."
 I wanted to say something, wanted to tell Alec he didn't need to worry about me, that I'd spent enough time by myself lately to be happy with my own company, but the words wouldn't come out.
 The sheer pleasure at having him hold me so close was like a drug.
 I could feel the pleasant, tingly sensation I'd started associating with his touch, and it was like the best full-body massage, tied up with chocolate and reading a classic.
 Unaware of my mild state of euphoria, Alec continued on.
 "Actually, I owe you another apology.

He obviously still wasn't convinced though.
 "Adri, you don't understand.

"I rather suspect whatever 'came up' is important enough I'll just have to be okay."
 He flinched a little, like maybe my aim had been a little too true.
 He looked for a moment like he was going to say something, but then his phone started vibrating again, and he simply nodded as he turned and walked away, moving much faster by himself than he did when I was with him.
 As I stared at the empty space where he'd been standing just a second before, I felt my chest start to constrict, and my breathing speed up.
 The sense of terror racing along my synapses was completely irrational, and extraordinarily powerful.
 Just as the room began to spin crazily around me, I felt a gentle touch on my shoulder.
 "Mistress Paige, is there anything I can get you?
 Something to eat perhaps?
 Or if you'd rather, I can show you to the theater."
 I chopped off a hysterical burst of laughter just before it managed to emerge full force and totally embarrass me.

As they entered the room it wasn’t hard to see the anger and disappointment.
 They were from different sides of this small town.
 My father’s dad was a butcher, his wife a seamstress.
 My mother’s dad was an oil rig grunt of American-Indian decent, and his wife, a meek submissive homemaker.
 Neither parent thought the other was good enough for their child, let alone the fact that they were both still children.
 Once the reason for the marriage was revealed, their parents accepted it as best as they could.
 My father’s parents arranged for them to live together in a small home while they finished school and awaited the birth of their baby.
 It was the late fifties and a pregnant teenager was an embarrassment.
 Shame followed the couple wherever they went.
 Thomas Richard was born on a cold December day to parents who were children themselves.

 Brandon shook his head and flashed another of his winning smiles, albeit one with an overtone of sympathy.

A knowledge of astronomy enabled sea-worthy vessels to travel across the oceans to distant lands.
 This led to the invention of systematic education as a method to pass on acquired knowledge and skills to the next generation and thereby continuously increase them.
 The Ultimate Resource
 These rich and varied discoveries came as the result of a careful observation and analysis of the external world around us, an infinite exploration and experimentation with things, an endless trial and error blending of minerals and plants to forge metals and produce medicines.
 As a result, for millennia we have tended to overlook or, at best, grossly underestimate the greatest of all resources and the true source of all the discoveries, inventions, creativity and productive power found in nature – the resource that has made minerals into ships that sail the skies, fashioned grains of sand into tiny electronic brains, released the energy of the sun from the atom, modified the genetic code of plants to increase their vigour and productivity – the ultimate resource, the human being.
 World Food Prize recipient and father of India’s milk revolution, Dr V. Kurien, has decried the tendency to credit external factors for the accomplishment of people.
 ‘It is the farmer that has produced this miracle, not the cow.’ And so it can be said of the Industrial Revolution and the Green Revolution.
 Looked at from a different perspective, the entire evolution of civilization is a progressive act of humanity’s self-discovery.
 At each stage of external observation and exploration, people have discovered more of their own inner capacity for resourcefulness.
 The material, technological, political, economic and social development of the world over countless centuries is an external expression of the growing discovery by humanity of the unlimited creative power of mental ideas, emotional aspirations, physical skills and higher values.

opment of human knowledge and skill has been the direct result of the application92m of0m this new knowledge to a wider range of situations and situations, and of this new creative power and understanding to other circumstances and situations.

 She loves the kids, so she’s always developing some new method, like creating a bi-weekly newspaper and having them write columns on their favorite subjects or assigning them to design their dream house and using the assignment to teach basic geometry.
 In summer, at the Boy’s and Girl’s Club, she teaches art to teenagers, most of them troubled or in trouble.

 It didn’t stop him from moving uncomfortably close, though, or eyeing me with what I was certain was the same look I’d just given my meal.

 Seth whirled around on the dwarf.
 “You set us up!” he hissed, sword drawn.
 “This was all a trap!” The dwarf's eyes widened in alarm, “I swear, sir, that I knew nothing of this!

The words were broken by gasping sobs, but they were understandable, if only just barely.
 Alec's hand on my shoulder just made me try to roll away.
 I didn't want his pity.
 Not after everything else he'd already done for me.
 Guilting him into helping me more just felt wrong.

 It was obvious we were on the wrong track here.

 One that wouldn't just make water glow with a dancing gold light, but plants too.

 I heard something snap off to my right, but I was too busy blushing from the chorus of giggles coming from the front of the classroom.
 Even Mrs. Alexander had an amused smile on her kind face.

 At least that is what I had always thought and that is what I had always done.
 Brandon looked at me as if he wanted to stop me but he lacked the clarity to speak, desperation the only thing evident on his weary face.
 The days since Brandon’s arrest had been some of the toughest days of his life.

 I had consumed my fair share of drugs and wasn’t just some innocent bystander.

 They certainly don’t have a book that can teach you how to be a good father and my own experiences as a son and a stepson had only given me insight on what not to do as a father.

All these decision makers require timely access to re liable sources of information.
 Information is needed to make sound business decisions, such as the production of or demand for different commodities or variations in price by region or over time.
 Easy access, maximum dissemination, full disclosure, precise accuracy and credibility are imperative.
 Creating these conditions will require the establishment of new institutions and substantial investment in infra structure.
 In many of these countries, the press has freed itself from being solely an instrument of government, but television is still largely under state control.
 In the entire former USSR today there is no adequate agricultural extension service to transmit research findings from the laboratory to the field, especially to small private farmers.
 Poor communications systems are incapable of handling the large volume of telephone, fax, telex and computerized messages needed for commercial linkages with other countries.
 10.Catalytic initiatives can release social dynamism: Social change is facilitated and accelerated by initiatives to introduce or demonstrate new patterns of activity and behaviour appropriate to the goals of the transition.
 One of the most successful initiatives of the Russian government in recent years has been the distribution of millions of small private agricultural plots to urban and rural households.
 Since a food shortage in the urban areas was the most pressing problem and greatest source of anxiety for the population, the government took steps to distribute more than 16 million small private plots to urban and rural families, so that highly vulnerable households could produce at least a portion of their own food requirements.

I'd never been so unnerved in my life.
 As Mrs. Alexander took roll and then released us into our groups, I was still trying to pull myself back together.
 It didn't help when I realized we were being evaluated today.
 I fished out my notes and desperately tried to remember how to calculate some of the stuff we'd need to know in order to successfully get our weight up the ramp, over the obstacles, and otherwise to the appropriate destination using the minimum number of pulleys, the shortest ramp, and the thinnest string possible.
 Alec hardly even looked up as Mrs. Alexander came by with our particular spool of thread, an array of metric weights, and a note card bearing the amount of weight we'd been assigned to move around.
 I was still leafing through my binder when Alec started testing the strength of our 'tow line.'
 I scooted my desk over and picked up a weight to hand to him, only to see the thread break as he successfully figured out the breaking point.
 Again and again it happened.
 I ran a calculation for how many pulleys we'd need to lift our weight up the thirty-degree incline on a string able to hold only a fourth as much, only to look over at his paper and see not only had he already arrived at the correct figure, he'd already thought to adjust for starting friction.
 Not used to being outclassed academically, I got flustered, which led to a misplaced decimal, and then an incorrect conversion from English to metric.

Neither the proliferation of small arms, nor the proliferation of drugs, nor the growth of terrorist and criminal activity can be solved as isolated problems, or by the independent initiatives of individual states.
 No country is exempt from the danger, which will continue to multiply unless checked and eradicated by concerted international action.
 Urgent steps are needed to classify and register small arms production and trade, to monitor and control their manufacture and limit their export.
 Agreements are needed to reduce production and severely restrict sales.
 Strong sanctions must be instituted to discourage states from actively or passively aiding or abetting small arms proliferation.
 The scope of the UN Conventional Arms Register should be expanded to cover small arms, but at the same time its provisions must be greatly strengthened in order to make this an effective mechanism.
 Reporting must be made mandatory rather than voluntary, and an independent surveillance system should be established to monitor compliance.
 The five permanent members of the Security Council, which together account for 80 per cent of the world’s arms sales, should also set up a system for mutual consultation on all large weapons orders.
 Mahatma Gandhi once explained that his efforts to suppress the natural aggressiveness of the people during India’s freedom struggle resulted in an explosion of violence between Hindus and Muslims when the country was partitioned.

Once he'd dug up every painful moment from my childhood, I was going to get to finally start learning about him.
 His pack too of course, but most importantly, I'd finally know more of what made Alec Graves tick.
 A couple of hours later at lunch, Mrs. Campbell had met the appearance of Rachel, Alec, and the rest of the pack with a raised eyebrow and a disbelieving headshake, but simply motioned them all over to the other side of the room, and handed me my test.
 Despite having spent weeks preparing for my makeup exam, I was still a little nervous until I started working the first problem.
 Forty minutes later I handed Mrs. Campbell a completed test, and got the extreme pleasure of watching her grade it and write a large, crimson 'A' on the front page.
 I was so excited I nearly squealed in delight.
 I managed to restrain myself, just barely, only to giggle as Rachel dropped her lunch and squealed for me.
 Dominic's gentle smile wasn't quite as enthusiastic, but I already knew her subdued reaction wasn't any less heartfelt.
 Throw in Jasmin's congratulations, which seemed to indicate the passing grade had been nothing less than inevitable, with Alec taking my hand as soon as I sat down, and Jessica and James' lack of response didn't matter at all.

 I pulled away, blushed, and started to follow Emily's tracks.
 Seth followed behind me and there seemed to be a new spring to his step.
 I couldn't even keep the smile off my face.
 Everything seemed a lot better to me.
 At the top of the hill, Emily and Jason were waiting for us.

It had two floors, with a fair sized kitchen and a mini living room.
 My room was just up the stairs, and it beckoned to me even though I was more interested in dinner.
 My mom was cooking in the kitchen and my dad was sitting at the kitchen table going through his usual paper work.
 He looked up as I entered, pushing his glasses back up his face.
 “Hi sweetheart, finally home?” he asked giving me a warm smile.
 I kissed his cheek and my mom’s before heading toward the stairs.
 “Yup.” “Dinner’s ready in a few minutes, Jazell!” My Mom called as I climbed the stairs, eager to collapse on my bed for a few minutes.
 “Got it!” I called back.
 My room was painted a light green, with a bed shoved in the corner and a bookshelf overflowing with books.
 I had a small desk to the left of my bed that was piled up high with homework and random drawings.

And if you said yes, I'd stop thinking altogether and spend all night making love to you.
 But when all I had left was my memories, I'd feel guilty that I'd taken your virginity and let you go back to 1927 with the guilt I know you'd feel.
 And-and I'd never know if maybe you were pregnant."
 The horrifying thought gripped his mind.
 "If we'd made love, you might have gotten pregnant and then gone back to 1927, and I would never have known that I had a child."
 That thought cooled his desire faster than anything else could have.
 He thought she might have changed her mind about staying if they'd made love—but what if they'd made love and she hadn't?
 Marie began sobbing.

Brandon's grin was more than a little sheepish as he fished his phone out of a front pocket and checked to see who was calling.
 I didn't need his groan to know it was one of his friends.
 A selfish urge to try and make him ignore the call and continue to focus on me momentarily flared up, but I suppressed it.
 It was such a petty thing to do, and even worse was probably the quickest way to demolish whatever interest he might have towards me.
 I might be almost completely naive when it came to dating, but anyone who'd read more than a couple books, or sat through eight or nine chick flicks, totally knew that the quickest way to drive a guy off was to become controlling and manipulative.
 Unless maybe you were a cheerleader and you were talking about a guy who was used to dating cheerleaders.
 Which while I wasn't even close to the former, the latter actually described Brandon almost perfectly.
 I almost stopped midway through the action of opening my car door, but it was too late.
 Even if I'd picked the wrong course, the moment was gone.
 I had to just play it cool and leave or risk looking like a total loser.

A similar organization is presently lacking for most other crops.
 The successful establishment of more than one million Self-Help Groups (SHGs) in India over the past three years providing access to credit for 15 million small farmers illustrates the power of organization.
 It is an indication that the phase of society’s predominant dependence on government initiatives for development is coming to a close.
 An organization combining the advantages of SHGs and contract farming through the agency of an NGO or an agri-business centre operated by farm and home science graduates or entrepreneurs can be successfully extended to other crops, providing the technical knowledge and essential inputs that small farmers need to raise productivity and farm incomes.
 Crop Diversification: Eradicating hunger necessitates shifting production from traditional crops to higher value added crops that can improve nutrition, while generating higher on-farm incomes and greater off-farm employment.
 Fruits and vegetables can remove micro-nutrient deficiencies, while dairy and poultry can eliminate protein deficiencies.
 The soaring price of petroleum, which has reached historical highs this year, presents an additional opportunity for countries such as India to become large scale producers and exporters of bio-fuels and bio-mass energy, thereby substituting imported petroleum with lucrative markets, higher incomes and greater employment opportunities for the rural population.
 Contract farming arrangements between small producers and agri-business centres can stimulate rapid development of this field.
 Ethanol, bio-diesel and bio-mass power from agricultural produce could generate the equivalent of 15 million additional employment opportunities in India, while raising rural incomes by US $10 billion annually.
 Water Conservation: Improving access to safe drinking water requires a combination of public education and government action.

in India is a key element of the health and safety of the human being. Water conservation and the development of water management systems can increase the quality and safety of drinking water in the country, while reducing the cost of the water used. Water conservation can also promote agriculture.92m<eop>0m<eod> A<sep><cls>

“Ah, what a thing, a mother’s diary.” Ruby went silent for too long and I wondered if she would be returning to this one-sided conversation any time soon.
 Her eyes flicked back to me.
 “It was very fortunate for me she’d kept a journal, you see, for I would have no fairy knowledge without it.” I felt my brows draw together and tried to smooth my face.
 “No, don’t feel bad for me.
 With you in such a position.” I didn’t know what she meant exactly, but she continued, “And my dear brother has been there for me all along, helping me with the elf parts.” She kept talking as she leaned forward, seemingly unaware I’d not spoken a word in response.
 Not that she’d given me much opportunity.
 I contemplated whether this was her usual behavior toward strangers or if she felt we had a special motherless bond.
 She ran her finger through the substance in the canister and it came out coated in a deep, dark green that had the consistency of grease, which she smeared across the base of my eyelid.
 She continued rambling as she coated various parts of my body with lotions and powders, smoothed my hair with a sweet-scented cream, painted my lips with a soft balm that smelled of spice.

Her eyes—my eyes—were dark.
 That muddy fog was gone now and under my black lashes waited deep emerald jewels, flecked with the darkest of browns.
 Chevelle had been right, this did suit me.
 The image in the mirror was stunning.
 It felt odd to marvel over my own reflection, but I couldn’t pretend I didn’t like it.
 The changes were still unnerving though, and I tried to remember what I looked like in my oldest memories, to see before, to see my mother’s face.
 The door opened behind me.
 “Ah, yes,” Ruby purred as she looked me over.
 “Lovely.” Her inflection left no doubt the word was not a compliment, only that she found it lovely she’d discovered me here.

We needed to help Brandon and I needed to believe this would also help the kids I was attempting to bust, just as my son getting busted was one step closer to hitting bottom, and hopefully one step closer to getting off of these powerful drugs.
 There was no turning back now.
 Before I got home from my massage, my crack-berry phone rang and it was Ashley.
 She called me to ask if I could bring her a few Oxys to hold her over for the night.
 I, of course, didn’t have any Oxys so I told her I couldn’t get out and we could do the whole deal at once.
 I couldn’t help but feel sorrow for her and guilt for what I was doing but I justified it in my mind that she needed to get away from this guy and that she needed to get help for her drug problem as well.
 I pictured my son and his willingness to do anything to get his next fix.
 When I arrived at home I called Officer White’s phone and told him I had a drug deal set up with Steve and Ashley and they wanted one hundred Oxy pills.

I was just far enough off to the side to watch as Alec's eyes very slowly and pointedly drifted down to stare at the note in her hands.
 For a second I wasn't sure she'd gotten the hint, but then those same hands clenched reflexively, nearly tearing the note before she caught herself and smoothed it back out.
 "Ms. Bellarose, please move up to Ms. Paige's old seat."
 Alec politely collected his note and led me to our seats.
 Any enjoyment I'd just experienced as a result of seeing one of my least-favorite teachers put in her place quickly soured as she started the class and launched into her usual barrage of questions designed to demonstrate my stupidity.
 Alec had apparently gotten under her skin even more than I'd realized.
 She abandoned her usual practice of stopping once I missed my first question, and instead continued to grill me, her smile growing each time I failed to answer something correctly.
 My earlier commitment to rededicate myself to school notwithstanding, the weekend hadn't exactly been conducive to mastering the intricacies of our latest subject.
 Her smile was wide indeed by the time the bell finally released me to flee in defeat and embarrassment.

Mixing more than casually with Nymphs always leads to problems, but it is not my problem.
 In fact,” he said with a careful glance around him.
 “I would have jumped at the chance myself.” “I am probably too ugly by both AElf and Nymph standards for her to be interested.
 Then again, you know Nymphs; they are naturally polyamorous and very sexual.
 It is a shock that she was not already sexually involved with one or both of us already.” Doi’van added, “Maybe her AElf blood means she does not have as strong a sex drive as most Nymphs since AElven marriage bonds are always monogamous.
 By the Celestial gods she is half AElf and half Nymph, who knows what to expect.
 Humans and Orqui are both in the middle of their two extremes and becoming emotionally involved with either always ends with heartbreak.” Doi’van’s deep voice was just stating a fact, if an unpleasant one.
 Rodregas nodded, he agreed but he was not the young man he looked.
 “I do understand that, and I expect nothing from her.”  He smiled and said, “But I do plan to enjoy what we do have for as long as it lasts.” “And when she takes other lovers?” Doi’van asked.

 “I am going to ask him a few questions.
 If either of you think he is going to cast a spell, kill him.” The other two nodded at Rodregas.

Efforts to accelerate the dismantling of both trade and non-trade barriers should be viewed as a central element of a global strategy to stimulate employment generation.
 6.Debt repayments: The debt problem is a major obstacle to the development and welfare of at least 60 heavily indebted, developing countries, including two-thirds of the world's poorest nations.
 Most of these countries suffered a decline in per capita income over the past decade and are now in arrears with more than 20 per cent of their debt obligations.
 The debt burden discourages new foreign investment and lending to these coun tries and prevents them from stimulating economic growth through additional domestic savings and investment.
 International debt relief has helped ten, mostly middle-income, debtor countries significantly reduce their commercial debt.
 Past actions to relieve the debt burden on low-income countries have been relatively small in relation to the amount of debt, which has continued to rise under the combined impact of accumulated interest arrears on old loans, falling export commodity prices, and new compensatory loans, frequently given on expensive terms.
 Unrealistic pressure to repay debt undermines debtors' capacity for constructive initiative.
 Past experience has shown that mere debt rescheduling in these countries does not solve the problem and may in fact aggravate it.
 The extent of the problem is reflected in the heavily discounted prices of the debts of countries with low and lower-middle incomes in the secondary market and in negotiated buy-outs of the debt owed to commercial creditors.
 In 1993, the average market price of the debt was about 30 cents on the dollar.

Once again the inherent weaknesses in the structure of the UN organization impact negatively on its capacity to perform the tasks rightfully allotted to it.
 The absence of a unified chain of command for national forces placed under UN command – culminating in the outright refusal of field forces to follow the commands of UN field staff, inadequate training and equipping of both military staff and fighting units, poor coordination between field units from different countries and between member states and UN headquarters – and a failure to vest sufficient authority in the UN Secretary General are among the most blatant weaknesses of the present system.
 Substantive measures are needed to strengthen the UN’s capabilities to handle crises.
 First and foremost, the position of the Secretary General, who now has the diplomatic status equal to that of a prime minister of a member state, should be upgraded to that of a head of state, with full authority over the forces placed under his command by member states to carry out the decisions of the Security Council.
 Problems of control over the armed forces of member states argue for the constitution of a standing international military force, as described in the previous section of this report.
 Lesser measures can be implemented immediately, such as provision of appropriate training to UN Secretariat personnel responsible for conflict prevention, expanding the staff of the Department of Political Affairs, and establishment by the UN of its own independent international surveillance capability, including a satellite system to monitor its work worldwide.
 Meanwhile, advanced computer, satellite and communications technology should be made available to the Secretariat by member states.
 A comprehensive system is needed to monitor military movements.
 Through its resident representatives, the UN should openly monitor political, ethnic, nationalist and religious developments that increasingly lie at the heart of conflicts in order to understand the complexities of local events and to anticipate potential turbulence.
 The right to sovereignty should not include the freedom to privacy in cases which involve support for terrorist groups, instigating border conflicts, arms build-ups, torture and genocide.

I've never said those kinds of things to anyone.

 She has to hate me."
 Brandon shook his head and flashed another of his winning smiles, albeit one with an overtone of sympathy.
 "I'm sure it isn't as bad as that."
 I wanted to disagree, to go into detail about why my life had just taken a turn for the worse, but something about his manner was suddenly distant.
 I thought about calling him out on it, but with my life suddenly looking like I was all but friendless, that didn't seem like such a good idea.
 Without really meaning to I'd managed to alienate just about everyone at school.
 Brandon already had plenty of reasons not to be with me, it was the height of stupidity to give him any more.
 I could probably deal with not having a boyfriend, even assuming that was what we were right now.

And this morning he dared to kiss her that way, knowing that it would make her all but forget her walk!
 When she returned to the house nearly half an hour later, she stormed past him and up to her room.
 Rick knew for sure that she was mad this time, knew why, and knew he'd been wrong to do what he'd done.
 "Sweetheart, I'm sorry," he called running after her.
 "I shouldn't have done it.
 I just wanted you to know--"  He heard her door slam.
 Going upstairs to knock on it, he called, "Marie, please come out and talk to me."

Mom wasn't any help.
 Most days she didn't even put on mascara.
 With the most depressing part of my routine now done, my mind wandered forward.
 It seemed only a second later that I was on the bus.
 I ignored the thought that Mom would be mad if she knew I'd skipped breakfast and hadn't brought any lunch.
 I pulled out my old, unabridged copy of Les Misérables.
 Every so often I'd try to make it through Victor Hugo's weighty classic, but so far I'd never made it past Marius' introduction.
 Having just finished up Pride and Prejudice for the third time, I was once again due to try and make it through the written inspiration to some of my favorite music.
 I hardly noticed the slow journey into town, instead caught up in a different time and place as Valjean's story started to unfold.
 All too soon, the bus pulled up to a medium-sized, two-story brick building, and five kids my age stood up to leave.

I guess all that practice has made me better at it than most of the shape shifters you've run into so far."
 It made sense, but didn't really help me fill in any of the broad holes that had been bothering me for so long.
 Mallory gave me several seconds to ponder her answer before continuing.
 "How is the rest of the pack?
 Alec will tell me, but he'll filter his answer through what he thinks I'm able to hear, not necessarily what I need to hear."
 "They're worried.
 Jessica and James seem to be the most unsettled by everything that's happened, but I think everyone is more or less concerned.

I felt his hand on my back and closed my eyes, relaxing into the comfortable, familiar feel of it.
 He pushed me with full force.
 I flew off the cliff, falling straight down.
 I stared back at him as he stood, watching me fall, nothing but open sky above and below.
 I couldn’t imagine why he’d throw me from the cliff, couldn’t think of the magic to stop myself, couldn’t see when I would crash into the base, the rocks below.
 My arms flailed as I jerked awake.

I let out another scream as my body tipped towards the edge of the dragon.
 I felt someone wrap their arm around me and I gave a grunt as I was pulled upright.
 Seth held me, his arm stiff and somewhat uncomfortable.
 I was frozen in fear, realizing that I hated falling.
 This was worse than my fear of rollercoasters.
 “Calm down,” Seth said to me.
 “You’re not going to fall-” “What do you mean, Seth?” I said in a panicked voice.
 “We’re freaking falling right now!” Emily looked at us and she tried to hide the fear in her face.
 “The dragon is going to pull its wings around us to protect us from falling but it’s going to make us fall faster.
 Make sure you hold on to something or get in the center.” Seth pressed himself against me and we leaned closer to the dragon’s back.

If I leave in the next ten minutes, we can make the flight out of Salt Lake International with something like half an hour to spare."
 We both sat there in silence for a few seconds as everything sank in, and then Mom exploded into motion.
 She ran downstairs to repack her photography equipment, all the while yelling upstairs to verify that I'd packed all of the other essentials she was going to need.
 Almost before I'd even finished assimilating how quickly Alec had pulled everything together, Mom was backing down the lane as I waved goodbye.
 Alec appeared within thirty seconds of Mom's departure, Isaac close behind him.
 "We need to go.
 One of Brandon's people just got close enough to smell us.
 They left before we could tell for sure who it was, but the odds of them coming back with lots of help just went through the roof.
 If we're still around when they do, things will get ugly."

Luckily I wasn't so far gone as to not recognize where we were.
 "Oh, gosh, that was the turnoff to my house.

 Brandon flashed me another smile and quickly maneuvered his car through a U-turn, a feat I was fairly certain was harder than it looked in the bulky muscle car.
 "No harm done.
 You guys bought the old Anderson home then?"
 I nodded, staring out at the desolate landscape.
 "You mean every single person in town doesn't already know everything there is to know about us?"
 "Oh, the joys of a small town.

I saw her as thin, pale skinned and strong like her mom, with reddish hair of a peculiar henna-like tint.
 Her eyes were bright and inquisitive, her mouth ever-ready to speak.
 "Oh Lord," I gasped because my heart was melting.
 A friend once asked me, "Do you think we can grow as much emotionally without having a child as we can with one?"
 All I could say was that my kids taught me how to love and, at twenty-six and twenty-three, they’re still teaching me.
 And with Zoë on her way, I found myself noticing people on sidewalks or in restaurants, imagining their lives and sending them good wishes, sometimes prayers.
 More often than before, I noticed hummingbirds, horizons, occotillos.
 Spring was the most glorious in years.
 I was feeling more all the time.
 In 1945, the year I was born, my grandma, Mary Durham Garfield, wrote this poem:

Despite my best efforts, I was mumbling so badly I wasn't sure anything I'd said was comprehensible.
 Somewhere in there I'd closed my eyes, so I felt a sluggish, tired kind of surprise when he gently brushed his fingers across the side of my face.
 The sensation was so feathery I almost opened my eyes to verify that he'd really touched me.
 It was too much effort.
 Besides, I didn't really want to know if he hadn't touched me, it was better to just go on pretending he had.
 "I'm afraid that really is the balance of my time.

I'd long ago learned that changing subjects and studying something new was almost as good as a break, so I swapped out books on a regular basis, and persevered despite increasingly-frequent head bobs.
 The attack came as a complete surprise.
 One moment I was quietly studying, an instant later hordes of shape shifters were pouring into the mansion.
 Most of them looked just like Simon and Nathanial, pony-sized wolves moving with blinding speed as they tore through doors and raced down halls.
 Brandon came in immediately behind the first batch of wolves.
 There was no way I could've known that the gray monster who casually sliced through walls and two-by-fours with his wickedly curved claws was Brandon, but I was somehow certain.
 He was built just like Alec had been Friday night, only so much bigger that he had to crouch forward to avoid hitting his head on the unusually high ceilings.
 Donovan faced off against one of the first wolves, but it was obvious he was no match for the grace and power of his opponent.
 The gentle, aging butler was knocked to the ground between one heartbeat and the next.
 I was mercifully spared from seeing the wreckage left when Brandon's wolves moved on, but there was no doubt in my mind that Donovan was dead.

“… who even left it with her?” It came together then, the feeling I’d had when I woke and placed it around my neck, the part of the dream I’d shaken off as I stood before the basin washing up, cleaning the blood from my hands, from the pendant.
 I wanted to explain, tell of what I’d seen in the dream, but it was foggy and I was too slow to pull it into thought.
 I was too late; they had already passed judgment on me.
 Harsh judgment.
 The deep voice boomed with finality.
 “… convicted of practicing dark magic…” The elder’s staff slammed against its wood base, echoing into the tumult of discord rising behind me.
 I reached out my hand to plead for mercy, to beg to be given a chance to explain, and he began to list my lineage for the records.

 Brandon looked at me for several seconds, and then chuckled.

Alec took my hand as Donovan opened the front door for us.
 He walked with a definite limp, one that was all the more painful when contrasted against his otherwise graceful movements.

 Rachel was waiting for us in a luxuriously-furnished sitting room.
 "Mother's been asking for you, Alec.
 I told her you'd be back soon, but she's worried."
 "I suppose this is a good opportunity to introduce Adriana."
 For the first time since I'd found out about Alec's secret, Rachel was looking uncertain.

I could hear others enter behind us, presumably witnesses, and I wondered if Junnie was among them.

After moving what he wanted to take with him to his pile at the entrance, he headed down the stairs to the dungeon.
 Rodregas did not want to go down there.
 Some of his worst memories were from his time down in the dungeon.
 Too many terrible deeds had occurred there, not that he had done many of them himself, but he had not been able to stop them.
 He could have tried to stop the terrible things that had happened, but he had simply chosen to survive instead.
 He knew the depth of his lack of true courage from his years of failure to act before now.
 He went through the guardroom and was happy to see that Captain Poir had followed orders; there was no sign of the eight or so prisoners, including his rescued AElfin maiden.
 He stared at the problem in the largest cell.
 There, sprawled on the floor, were the two female Dire Cats that had been used to trap the Celestial lion.

He was glad that was one trait that Imeralda did not seem to have.

 For a second he thought that he was tied down, but Rodregas could see enough to determine that his restraints were tightly tucked bed sheets.
 He must be very weak.
 “Easy there young man,” said the old Nymph.
 The Nymph slowly helped him up and held a bowl to his mouth.
 “My name is Durien and I am healer, please slowly drink this.
 Rinse your mouth out with it as your mouth is probably very dry after all this time.” The drink tasted like tea or maybe a light broth.
 As soon as Rodregas started to drink it, he realized he was starving.

He normally found the sight of the Immortal Guards reassuring; the great sigil warriors were sworn to the protection of Immortalist, like himself, but he knew these two would cut him down like a common pauper if they sensed he was a danger to their Master.
 There was a short hallway leading from the doors with slim white columns on each side of the hallway, in between each column hung great pieces of art; paintings, sculptures and even a small wall hanging with amazing vibrant colors with a strange abstract design were all preserved in the space.
 Van’dret was a man of some refinement and appreciation for art, and he wished he had dared to stop and inspect the pieces; they had to be some of the greatest art works in the Realm to be so on display where only those who had been invited to a private meeting with Taiga would see them.
 However Van’dret dared to do nothing more than glance at them as he hurried forward.
 It would not be smart to make the Guild Dealer wait for even a moment.
 The Guild Dealer Taiga was not such a common man that he did his work from a desk; his desires and commands came during parties and social events.
 However, if you were truly honored, though personal invitations to dine with him in his personal solar overlooking his city you would get told his wishes.
 As Van’dret stepped through the arch he was struck by the bare simplicity of the solar.
 The city known as the Menagerie of Sky, Earth and Water that Taiga ruled and had created over the centuries was a lush place, full of pleasures and growing things.
 Anything that could be found in the world was said to be found within its gleaming walls and exotic gardens.

 Maybe I'd just been overtired, or possibly the strange, symbol on the note, inked into the place where a signature normally would've been, had reminded me of the other truly alien experience so far in my life.
 Whatever the reason, it felt like I'd spent all night on the edge of one of the incredible, vivid dreams.

Others would tell us to rely on God indirectly, by reading and following the example of Christ and the principles he gave.
 In the Sermon on the Mount alone, Christ urges us to keep our desires in check, speak the truth, give sacrificially, set aside worries, pray, withhold judgment except about our own thoughts and actions, and ask for good gifts such as wisdom.
 Mostly to slow my whirling mind, I speak a prayer, a request I have often made, asking God to help me love better.
 And what comes is a reminder of something I've been told more than once.
 As I recall, the first time came at the University of San Diego.
 When I moved back to my hometown of San Diego from Chico, I left behind a tenured professorship.
 My two kids lived with me and cost plenty.

 One semester, I taught nine classes at four colleges, about 90 hours a week, which left me too weary to write, or so I thought.

One of the startling revelations found in these tapes is that Lorelei was with Buddy until the end.
 Rumors had her abandoning him after they had left Memphis for Los Angeles.
 Stories circulated back home about her, unflattering stories all, about her working in the pornographic film industry, about her fixing Buddy that final fix, about her leaving him for a slick-talking Hollywood casting agent.
 What is made clear here is her devotion to him and his to her.
 In this way they resemble John Lennon and Yoko Ono, another vastly misunderstood couple.

 It all seemed so impossible, legends brought to life and paraded before my incredulous eyes, and yet there was no arguing with the truth.
 It was starting to sink in that I needed to come to terms with all of the natural implications.
 Things like the fact that some or all of my attraction to Alec was based on his ability to addict humans to him, intentionally or not.
 James and Jessica were squared off against Alec now while Isaac and Jasmin watched.
 I'd thought everyone else moved fast, but Alec was even faster.
 He actually dodged Jess' jump, causing her to latch onto nothing more than thin air, while he spun around and hit James with a blow to the chest that had to have broken ribs.

He was groggy with pain, and both weak and filled with rage.
 The guard in his hands was thrashing and spasming in unspeakable pain.
 As the guard collapsed to the ground, Rodregas fell with him.
 He tried to once more roll to the side, struggling away from a potential final stroke.
 Rodregas’ face was covered in gore and blood.
 It was hard for him to see.
 He struggled back up, but fell, then Rodregas felt a presence to his right.
 It was too small to be Doi’van and Rodregas staggered over reaching for him, determined to take one final slaver with him.
 His wounded leg buckled again, and Rodregas tried to reach for the ground to slow his fall, but something was wrong with his arm and it did not move.

 There'd been an attack of course.
 There might have even been a bit of a cover-up by local, or regional, authorities, but Britney's father was probably right in assuming the motivation had been protecting the tourist industry.

 As I threaded between a pair of closely-set tables I noticed that Alec's table seemed unusually unsettled.
 If a shouting match could be conducted in whispers, it was being done by Jasmin and James, neither of who looked like they were happy about whatever was being discussed.
 Alec wasn't talking, but from the way he was scanning the room, he didn't want to be there anymore than the rest of them.
 I made it to Brandon's table, and was still pulling my meal replacement drink out of my bag when the loudspeaker clicked on with the obligatory burst of static.

Coping with this threat is made more difficult because, more often than not, such weapons in the hands of non-state actors, especially militants and terrorists, are superior to those available to security forces and law enforcement agencies of the state, and because detection and control of their distribution pose serious problems.
 No serious efforts are being made to stop this cancerous proliferation.
 In fact, many states have actively fostered proliferation as an instrument of their own policies.
 One of the most serious consequences of this trend is the linkage between small arms proliferation and the drugs trade.
 The use of and trade in narcotics represents a menace not only to the health and well-being of individuals and societies, but also to international security.
 The scale of the problem can be judged by the reported fact that Americans, who represent five per cent of the world’s population, consume fifty per cent of the world’s cocaine.
 In Pakistan, where there were virtually no drug addicts a decade ago, it has been reported that as many as 3 per cent of the population are addicted and thrice that number use drugs frequently.
 The CIS has now been added to the traditional drugs routes emanating from the Peru–Colombia–Panama, Pakistan–Afghanistan, and Myanmar–Thailand–Laos regions.
 The drugs menace is transnational in character with far-reaching implications for societal and international peace and security.
 The countries and regions which produce these drugs, and through which the trade flows, have been afflicted by endemic violence and social turbulence.

feration of small arms in a region92m where0m many people are vulnerable to violence, and in a region where many people are vulnerable to terrorism, is the threat posed by the growing proliferation of narcotics. The proliferation of small arms is a threat which is increasingly disproportionate and disproportionate.<sep><cls>

Self-reliance released the creativity, generated the determination and mobilized all available resources to make the transition successful.
 It is too early to predict the eventual outcome in Yugoslavia, subject as it is to extraordinary external constraints on public policy.
 However, the initial evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that alternative approaches can and must be fashioned which are more comprehensive in scope, more balanced in implementation, more pragmatic in conception and less influenced by extreme ideological viewpoints.
 It is likely that further study of the Yugoslav model will reveal important applications not only for countries suffering from hyperinflation or the effects of radical transition, but for those carrying out more modest programmes fo economic reform.
 Recommendations for Accelerating Transition in the East
 Conditions within the 25 nations of Eastern Europe and Central Asia vary significantly enough to limit the scope for broad generalizations on strategy beyond the statement of principles presented in this chapter.
 However, there are a number of specific recommendations applicable to all or most of these countries that can be applied to accelerate the pace and ease the pain of transition.
 1.Generate consensus for the transition programme: The transition should be an expression of the will of the society for change and it should help generate greater unity and harmony within the society.
 Further attempts to put through any macro-economic reform package will meet with strong political and social resistance unless a national consensus on the strategy is arrived at beforehand.
 Any programme involves a set of choices regarding which are the most accept able costs and important benefits.

tent that the decision to make a programme on the policy is made in a national consultation meeting of the State Council, the government must have a clear understanding of the political and social aspects92m of0m the strategy and must be able to implement them in a practical manner and in a balanced and realistic manner.<sep><cls>

I waved goodbye to everyone as they left, and then made a quick round of the remaining students.
 Rachel and Britney were both in their accustomed places, Rachel studying away as always, and Britney making some weak efforts to do likewise.
 Two of the other three, a boy and a girl I recognized from second hour, but whose names I couldn't even begin to remember, were already packing their books into a pair of book bags, one of which was a fairly utilitarian item, the other of which probably cost as much as my whole wardrobe.
 I couldn't place the last boy for all that he looked really familiar.
 He had incredibly dark skin and features with a slight Middle Eastern cast.
 When he shifted in his seat, I realized he was built like a football player.
 Not like a lineman, but like a running back, or maybe a quarterback.
 He wasn't as big as Brandon, or even as Alec, but he was obviously well muscled, and he moved with an echo of their grace.
 None of which helped me figure out where I'd seen him before.
 He wasn't a regular at the tutor lab, and didn't have the hectic, desperate look of someone cramming for a test.

For decades Japan maintained trade barriers to keep the price of rice at more than six times the international level in order to protect and preserve domestic rice producers; the US government exports subsidized wheat; and the European Community sells subsidized milk powder and butter internationally at prices up to one-third below the domestic level.
 The debate over the legitimate role of government in protection of the agricultural economy is partially a question of timing.
 Market institutions and competitive strengths are normally built up over decades.
 Advanced nations with highly mechanized and efficient agricultural sectors are in a much better position to withstand the impact of foreign competition than countries at an earlier stage of development.
 Countries suffering from food deficits and those in the midst of radical economic reforms are ill-advised to make a sudden, wholesale shift to market mechanisms to stimulate growth of this sector.
 ICPF strongly favours a movement towards the liberalization of world trade in agricultural products because it can be of immense benefit to job creation, industrialization, and economic growth in developing countries, and thereby act as a driving force for growth and employment generation in the industrial world as well.
 The liberalization of domestic policies for this sector is also needed in developing countries where government controls and populist policies have often retarded growth of agriculture.
 However, the timing and extent of these measures should be dictated by the relative strengths and needs of each particular country, not by strict adherence to any economic doctrine.
 Role of Government
 Agricultural subsidies and protection are subsets of a larger issue – the role of government in agricultural development.

of government in the protection of the agricultural economy is a critical issue, the need for a more comprehensive approach is also a vital one. Government subsidies and protection are essential to the development of agriculture.92m<eop>0m<eod> "...............<sep><cls>

It is particularly acute in agriculture.
 Hoarding, speculation by traders, regional shortages and price variations have been aggravated by the absence of alternative systems of distribution to replace the old centralized food procurement system.
 Privately operated commodity exchanges have sprung up to handle wholesale transactions.
 But unfamiliarity with such institutions, and the lack of a firm legal basis for enforcement of contracts and a system of grading and inspection to guarantee the quality of produce traded, have kept most buyers and sellers away.
 A mechanism is needed to insure distribution of food to deficit areas, to guarantee farmers an indexed floor price for foodgrains under conditions of unstable, soaring prices, and to establish and maintain a national buffer stock against emergency.
 The Indian Food Corporation and Indian National Dairy Development Board, the autonomous marketing boards in the UK, and the US Commodity Credit Corporation are model institutions from which the Eastern Europeans need to borrow, adapt and innovate to suit the conditions of vast food-deficit nations.
 Simple commercial systems need to be created to support commerce and industry as well – even such basic systems as telephone listings of sources of products and services that are found in every telephone directory in the West.
 If trade is to develop between private enter prises, credit checking agencies and collection agencies need to be established.
 For enterprises which do not qualify or cannot compete for limited bank resources, financial institutions offering hire purchase or leasing of industrial and consumer goods are necessary.
 The market reforms were expected to lead to a rapid proliferation of new small enterprises, but most of those created so far are engaged only in trading and retail sales.

rge-scale commercial enterprises which have emerged in the last few years have been small-scale retail and wholesale enterprises. The first of these small-scale businesses was the retail and wholesale trading industry.92m<eop>0m<eod> The "" " " " " " " <cls>

 There was no way I could've known that the gray monster who casually sliced through walls and two-by-fours with his wickedly curved claws was Brandon, but I was somehow certain.
 He was built just like Alec had been Friday night, only so much bigger that he had to crouch forward to avoid hitting his head on the unusually high ceilings.

 Once it was just the four of us, Britney waved me over and held up her homework.
 "I don't get it.
 What is the answer to this one?"
 I shook my head in exasperation.
 "Me telling you the answers won't help you on the test.
 If you have a specific question about how to work a problem I'd be more than happy to help you, but I'm not going to do your homework for you."

Hundreds of us lost souls crowded in front of the portable stage somewhere around the goal line.
 I suspected the others, like me, wanted to get near Billy Graham and his giant companions, for comfort and to borrow some of their power.
 The singing giant led a few thousand folks in a hymn.
 “Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling, calling oh sinner come home, come home, come home, ye who are weary come home…” I mumbled the surrender words I heard someone else say, and waited.
 Cliff had stayed beside me.

At the time, it seemed like, “Wow, my dad is cool,” but I later realized how sick it all truly was.
 The fact is, this man was never a father or a dad or anything to me.
 Richard basically knocked my mother up in high school, married her, had another son and abandoned her and his sons while they were still babies.
 He never paid my mother a dime in child support.
 My mother tried to warn me when I decided I wanted to meet him, but as only time would tell, trying to tell your teenage son anything is a virtual impossibility.
 After I graduated high school, I went to Hawaii with a friend to live.

This pressure has recently been aggravated by the impact of structural adjustment programmes that usually involve drastic reduction in government subsidies.
 In Ghana, for instance, the cost of fertilizer as a percentage of total cultivation cost has risen ten-fold in recent years.
 The impact of macro-economic reforms on agriculture has been most severe in the countries of Eastern and Central Europe, where production in this sector has fallen drastically over the past few years.
 Technology
 Slower growth in productivity can be attributed to a slowdown in the development of improved hybrid varieties, shortages of quality seeds and fertilizers, and the absence of techno-infrastructure facilities needed for storage and processing, expansion of markets, transport and distribution.
 Environment
 A number of factors are posing serious obstacles to productivity growth and threaten even current levels of production.
 Of the poor, 80 per cent in Latin America, 60 per cent in Asia and 50 per cent in Africa live on marginal land of low productivity and high susceptibility to environmental degradation.
 Raising productivity on these lands can be extremely difficult.
 Quality farmlands are being lost at an astonishing rate to diversion for non-farm uses, desertification, deforestation, soil erosion, and the depletion and pollution of water resources.

Seth gave me a maniac’s grin, “You already know the answer to that.” Then he shot me right in the face.
 I blocked most of the spray from my face but water still leaked through my fingers.
 I felt the cold water seep through my clothes and onto my skin as Seth continued to soak me.
 “Crap Jason, shut it off!” Emily hollered but it didn’t work because I heard her yell again as he sprayed her hair.
 I couldn’t see anything because my eyes were half shut and I was afraid Seth would wash my eyes out.
 “Seth seriously, stop.” You can’t command boys to do anything and to prove that, Seth shot my butt.
 Eventually they stopped, only because three water guns can hold only so much water and Emily and me looked like we could kill.
 We were both completely soaked to the bone and even though in was the middle of summer, we were shivering.
 The boys looked completely satisfied with how we looked.
 After Emily and I gave them a look, they tore down the street and disappeared.

We had to walk several more steps before I recognized the leather-clad, dark-haired figure on the bike as Alec.
 My feet must have unconsciously slowed because Britney was now several steps ahead of me and looking back impatiently.
 I tried to catch up, but Alec chose that moment to look up and stare in our direction.
 He was quite a ways away, and his lovely eyes were covered by a pair of sunglasses, but I somehow knew he was looking at me.
 He handed Rachel a helmet but continued to look at us, at me, while she put it on.
 I was moving again, but my pulse sped up as Rachel grabbed a hold of her brother and swung her leg over the pillion seat on the bike.
 She seemed to see us for the first time as a cold chill arced down my back and the horizon started to vibrate.
 I managed to raise my hand in response to her wave, but it was an absent motion.
 My attention was still on Alec and his unwavering stare.
 Rachel leaned forward as if to say something to him, and he finally nodded and dropped the bike into gear.

The two collided in a brutal exchange of steel.
 The elf shoved his sword upward, using his forward momentum to slam the point straight at Harruq’s throat.
 Harruq swung Condemnation left, deflecting the incoming thrust.
 His other blade stabbed, tearing away the soft flesh beneath his attacker’s ribcage.
 The elf leapt back, landed shakily, and then lunged once more.
 His speed was not what it should have been, though, and Harruq needed little opening.
 He swung both swords, the entirety of his might behind them.
 The elf blocked.
 His sword was elven-make and had been wielded in his hands for two hundred years.

Accepting the spiritual principle which tells us that there is an element of truth even in the most outrageous or misinformed viewpoint, we must not only vehemently condemn but also sincerely recognize the unaddressed issues that underpin the urge for violence.
 In this sense, terrorists crudely expose the mental insincerity prevalent in international politics.
 Those who wield national power must come to realize that force of compulsion will not bring about a permanent reconciliation and amelioration of relationships in human affairs.
 Superior power must bring with it a superior sense of fairness and a commitment to constructive dialogue and action to attack the root causes of terrorism.
 It must shed its own accretion of mental insincerity cloaked as diplomacy.
 Then and then only these movements of violence will shrink and finally disappear.
 The period following September 11th, as US National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice put it, is one “not just of grave danger, but of enormous opportunity.”
 Resolving Local Conflicts: The Commission concluded that the end of the Cold War made it possible to successfully resolve problems that had resisted solution for decades, such as the many violent communal and ethnic conflicts occurring in the world.
 The near total cessation of violence in North Ireland during the past 10 years is proof that rapid progress can be made on issues involving apparently intractable communal sentiments.
 This achievement appears astounding to those who lived through the earlier decades of religious violence and until recently found it nearly impossible to imagine a mitigation of the conflict in the foreseeable future.

 She'd probably been saving a question about light since we'd started the unit.
 Just in case an opportunity presented itself to earn some brownie points.
 "Mrs. Alexander, I read something about water around reactor cores giving off a blue light.
 Can you explain how that works?"
 I'd expected something stupid, but glowing water made me think of the vivid dreams.
 I listened as intently as I'd ever listened to anything, and did my best to follow all of the diagrams as Mrs. Alexander attempted to break a college-level concept down into something fairly average high-school students could follow.
 "So, in short, really it's a matter of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms attempting to shed the excess energy they've gained from the radioactive particles emitted from the core.
 The energized electrons give off radiation in the visible light spectrum during the process of dropping down to a lower energy state."
 Hmm, an interesting concept, but still not an explanation for how the water in my dream had given off a soft golden glow, one that had rippled with the movement of the water.

James is going to pant when he sees you."
 Rachel had started prepping for the dance early, doing first her own makeup, and then Jasmin's while I was still gone with Alec.
 By the time I'd returned, Rachel's youthful features had taken on a mature cast that'd make all kinds of boys wish they'd taken a risk and asked Alec's little sister out.
 Jasmin had about the least reason out of any girl alive to be an expert hair dresser since her naturally wavy hair could just air dry and still look like she'd spent hours working on it, but an expert she was.
 The results of her efforts on Rachel's behalf were nothing less than spectacular, and the casual-looking knot of curls and twists was wispy in all the right places.
 Even with Rachel currently an order of magnitude hotter than normal, Jasmin still captured the prize.
 Rachel's work on her behalf had resulted in a makeup job that was so incredibly understated, even us girls had a hard time detecting it.
 Her wavy brunette hair had been straightened and pulled back in what looked like an attempt to let some other girls shine for a change, but it just made her look like a goddess who'd decided to spend the night slumming.

The world possesses enough technology to double or triple the food supply in a decade, if only the world’s poorest two billion people have the purchasing power to consume it.
 So, too, the problem of employment.
 Humankind has employed itself ever since the dawn of civilization.
 So long as people have wants and are willing to work to fulfil them, there need not be a shortage of jobs for all who seek them.
 The problem today is not a shortage of money or technology.
 The problem is that we have constructed a hermetically sealed economic system that does not permit all people to express that willingness.
 Even if we reached the advanced stage of technological development that enabled one-tenth of the world’s population to produce all the goods and services to which all humanity could ever aspire, what would prevent us from distributing that work in such a manner as to provide everyone with the opportunity to acquire the purchasing power to consume their share of that over-abundance?
 The main limit on the production of sufficient goods to create prosperity for all is not material, financial, or technological.
 It is the inefficiency and arbitrariness of the present economic system that fails to take advantage of the vast latent market potential of nearly half the human race.
 Give these people the chance to work and they will create the markets to provide jobs and higher incomes for everyone.

A rumbling commenced.
 At first I thought it was a landslide.
 A granite stone about three feet across came bounding and crashing toward us, gathering speed as it careened.
 We scrambled off the boulder and into the shelter of a grotto beside the trickling stream.
 Once we caught our breath, we crawled and peeked out from behind the rocks that formed the grotto’s walls.
 On the hillside, Tom stood waving our crowbar, bellowing laughter and prying loose another big stone.
 We tugged on our jeans and shoes while he rolled more stores and slung smaller rocks at us.
 The way his legs slashed and arms whirled, he looked like some rabid demon.

 Rodregas was surprised to find a pile of equipment outside his door the next morning, and Imeralda sorting through the pile.
 It appeared to be mostly their equipment plus miscellaneous pieces of slaver gear.
 Doi’van stood watching, clearly not sure what to make of it.
 When Rodregas tried to apologize Imeralda ignored him and instead said, “We traded the Immortal Guard equipment for safe harbor here at the village for healing.
 But, of course, there were also regular slaver guards and I claimed their equipment and any money that was in their personal money pouches.” “Your armor got pretty chopped up,” she continued, “and Doi’van did not have any armor to start with.

Also kept in the tower were two of the nicest weapons Rodregas had ever seen: a pair of recurve bows of Wood Nymph created black yew.
 There was no way they would have been taken.
 There were standing orders to kill anyone who tried to remove them.
 Rodregas was not a very good bowman, but he was definitely going to try to bring them with him.
 He peeked out of the main doors and looked around the open keep.
 The stables were to the left and the gate was to the right.
 The courtyard was not large.
 He could not see anyone, but he knew there would be at least two guards left: one at the gate and one in the watchtower over the gate.
 In front of the stable was a large bony horse, dappled in brown and white.

By the time people started trickling out and my shift started, I'd spent plenty of time watching Britney pout, and very little time actually working on my homework.
 I think it was really starting to sink in that she wasn't going to be able to get out of continuing to spend most of her afternoons here.
 Albert, Mrs. Campbell, and the other tutor all waved goodbye as they left.
 One of the cheerleaders, a particularly whiny specimen named Jackie, wanted help, which I was happy to offer, even in my current state.
 Unfortunately she thought that meant I'd just hand over all the answers.
 We spent a good ten minutes with her trying to offer a variety of covert bribes ranging from the insignificant to things she couldn't possibly deliver.
 I kept telling her I wasn't interested and that she'd just have to do the work.
 Surprisingly enough, once she accepted that, she actually buckled down.
 It only took another ten minutes to explain the Pythagorean theory to her.
 By the time I stood up from Jackie's desk, there were only four of us left.

By the time I finished telling my plan and reasons, the rage had waned just enough so I let him have the gun.
 A few days later, Bob and I caught a ride out of Albany, Georgia with a slick young man named Johnny.
 His blond hair was oiled and wavy.
 He wore a silk shirt and drove a fast, red convertible.
 Though he claimed to have gotten out of prison only yesterday, he blazed at about twice the speed limit down Highways 19 and 41 into Florida and all the way to Miami.
 He talked about money, women, and other stuff he’d missed while in prison.
 When he asked if we would be looking for work in Miami and we said probably, he nodded and chucked my arm.
 “Hey, the boss will set you up.” The boss lived in a palace on a canal.
 He was a midget who needed a wheelchair, but whose live-in babe was about twice his height and half his age.

 "But Mrs. Tiggs, isn't that covered in Chapter 18?
 I mean, I just started the class obviously, but it just seems confusing.
 Your syllabus says we're talking about the preterit today."
 The only other person I'd ever met who could've even come close to pulling off such an innocent expression was Rachel, and I wasn't sure even she could compete with Dominic today.
 If I'd found her standing in front of a broken window with a rock in her hand, and she'd told me she had no idea why the window had shattered, all the while flashing me that look, I would've believed her.
 Mrs. Tiggs apparently wasn't quite so gullible.
 "It's a reasonable question, as the two subjects are highly related.
 One could almost say they're so close to the same thing that any distinction is purely arbitrary."
 Now Dominic looked both innocent and confused.

For months I lived in abject fear.
 Of losing my mind.
 Of my heart giving out.
 I remembered the faces my dad used to make as he fumbled in his pocket for his stash of nitroglycerin, with every muscle straining at once as if the strain was all that held him together.
 Panic attacks work like this: adrenalin kicks in when it has no business doing so.
 Because it’s so unwarranted, the fight or flight response it unleashes causes a paralyzing sort of fear, which spirals upward into what feels like the beginning of eternal torment.
 While under the spell of that malady, I came upon 1 John 4:18 in the King James version: “There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment.
 He that feareth is not made perfect in love.” I can testify that fear has torment, even that fear is torment.
 And since I suffered and recovered from panic attacks, I feel qualified to offer a remedy.
 Back then, I often read The Daily Word, which frequently repeated the message, “Let go and let God.” What we churchgoing folk might call surrender.

Lane was someone I probably never would've befriended if not for Eric.
 Since we met in seventh grade, I had considered Lane a smart-mouthed little pest while he thought of me as a big, dumb oaf.
 In Eric's company, we each learned better.
 I have Eric's treasures, which Sylvia gave me.
 Along with them came a treasure of hers, a letter from Pam Greenman.
 She wrote, "One can't begin to talk about Eric because there is no beginning, just as there is no end.
 To say what he was would be impossible since he was so different to so many people.
 To me he was something intangible.
 You could hear him, feel him, see him, but you could never grasp hold of what there was inside of him that made him Eric.

I covered my head with a corner of the blanket, suffocating my fractured thoughts with the absence of light.
 I was unsure how long I’d slept.
 The house was quiet when I slipped from bed, trying not to make a sound.
 I peeked into the main room, finding Chevelle sitting against the front wall, a small window over his head.
 He leaned over, working on something in the palm of his hand, a steady scratching accompanying the movement of his wrist.
 I started forward and my boot scuffed the floor, alerting him to my presence.
 As he glanced up, he slid whatever he’d been working on into a pocket at his hip.
 It dawned on me then that the main room had only the entrance and two other doors.
 If we were staying with Ruby then the second room must be hers.
 I meant to offer Chevelle my room to sleep in, but the look on his face was so unnerving I could not stop myself from offering something else.

The only way to know for sure was to see him with all of the masks off again.
 "Sure, I'd love to.

 I ignored the spate of nasty looks shot my way, gathered my books, accepted the bundle of papers, and hurried off to the stairs.
 It was later than last time, so unless I was quick the bell was going to ring before I made it back down the stairs.
 The congestion was bad in the halls, but for some reason it was twice as bad around stairs.
 Apparently I was hurrying just a little too fast.
 I tripped just before I hit the first step, and almost went crashing down the flight that led to the basement.
 Luckily I was just quick enough to grab the banister and save myself from a broken neck.
 I didn't quite manage to avoid twisting my ankle though, so I limped all the way up to the second floor.

 It seemed so strange that she had saved his life, since at that moment he felt like all she wanted was to see him dead.

My name is Mrs. Alexander, and you must be Adri.
 Oh, not Adri?
 Very good then, Adriana it is."
 I watched bemusedly as Mrs. Alexander searched through her pockets for something to write with for at least half a minute before realizing she'd placed her pen behind her ear.
 The form now signed, the pen went back behind her ear for safekeeping, and she motioned me to a seat, predictably at the back of the classroom.
 As I negotiated the crooked path between desks, I found myself looking forward to the class.
 Right up until Alec slipped into the classroom a few seconds before the bell rang.
 If there'd been any justice in the universe, he'd have somehow gotten uglier over the last few hours.
 That or I'd have developed some kind of partial immunity to him.
 Neither was the case, he was just as unearthly gorgeous as he'd been in the hall.

 “The syphon said he would be rewarded for grabbing me.

I may die, but if I win I can earn a greater sigil, maybe even bring you into the chamber as my servant.
 If both Doi’van and I had a greater sigil, we would be much more likely to survive the upcoming battles,” Rodregas said.
 “We would still get spitted like a pig to the roast without decent armor,” said Doi’van, “but as the Gods have yet to provide the armor, we will show these human squires the armor of our faith and the armor of our courage.
 I just don’t like having to watch you fight such battles and not be able to fight myself.” growled Doi’van.

 I could get you five points there even with a regular bow, otherwise I am happy to watch you big boys show how tough and strong you are.” Rodregas smiled at Doi’van’s and Imeralda’s courage even though their personalities were opposites.

More people are working than ever before, yet at the same time more people are unemployed, because a larger proportion of the population seek jobs.
 Growing anxiety about employment prospects in the West were aggravated by a sudden 50 per cent increase in unemployment after 1990, which displaced an additional 10 million workers in the OECD and was equalled only by the previous high of 1983.
 This increase is now showing signs of reversal.
 These average figures disguise significant differences in performance of countries within the OECD.
 Since 1950, Japan’s employment rate has risen from 43 per cent to around 50 per cent, while unemployment has remained in the 1 to 3 per cent range.
 The overall proportion of the population employed in the European Community has declined by 1 per cent since 1965 and is presently just under 41 per cent, but the percentage of the working age population employed has remained more or less constant over the past three decades, at 67 per cent, whereas in other OECD regions it has risen significantly – to exceed 75 per cent in North America, Scandinavia and Japan.
 Europe’s lower labour participation rate is attributable to a number of factors.
 A far higher percentage of the European workforce was engaged in agriculture 25 years ago and has since shifted to non-agricultural sectors, an adjustment that occurred in the United States during earlier decades.
 During the 1980s Europe chose a high-wage path to growth, passing on the benefits to the existing workforce but creating relatively few new jobs; whereas the United States, with a similar economic growth rate over the decade, showed lower income growth per worker, but a steadily rising employment rate.
 Europe is now confronted with the need for structural adjustment to compensate.

He had been able to buy several Dire Cats from the Immortalist Guild dealer Taiga.
 With magic, he caused them to go into heat.
 It was known to be very difficult to affect Dire beasts with magic, and his success had shown his power and accomplishment as a mage.
 Rodregas had regretted not being on duty when the Dire Cats were staked out on the roof.
 Rodregas had heard from the other guards that the cats were in heat, and as Ravenhurr had hoped, a Celestial Lion had sensed their presence while the lion was out during the full moon with the Wilde Hunt, and the great lion had spent the last few nights doing his best to impregnate both of the female beasts.
 The whole keep could hear the wild rutting going on.
 Ravenhurr then had goats released on the roof and the Celestial Lion had gorged himself on them when he had finished rutting.
 The well-satisfied beast lay limp, sleeping, confident in his celestial power, and oblivious to his surroundings.
 He lied unbound, as required by the ceremony.
 Rodregas assumed some subtle magic had been used to influence the beast to sleep in just the right spot.

So I tracked him down and called him.
 Richard was living in Arkansas and had been for many years.
 We talked on the phone and upon discovering he would be near our homes on a business trip, arranged a meeting at a hotel—with Thomas too.
 Thomas begged out at the last minute, and without contacting Richard I brought my friend Bill with me for the drive into the bay area.
 When I knocked on the door of the hotel room, my father opened the door looked at me, called me Thomas, and then he looked at Bill and called him by my name.
 He didn’t even know what his own kids looked like.
 We spent a brief time in the hotel room getting our names and heritage correct then we were off to dinner.
 During the dinner, Richard asked if I could “score some toot” which I discovered meant find cocaine.
 Well, I didn’t need to look much past my pocket to score, so we ended up getting drunk and snorting toot to commemorate our father and son reunion.
 At the time, it seemed like, “Wow, my dad is cool,” but I later realized how sick it all truly was.

A pale hand grabbed Dieredon’s throat, its grip iron and its flesh ice.
 “It will be painful,” Velixar said.
 Vile magic swirled about his hand, pouring into Dieredon’s neck.
 The blood in his veins clotted and thickened.
 A toss of his hand and the elf flew through the air.
 He rolled across the ground without the usual grace he had shown in combat.
 Qurrah glanced about, paralyzed with fear.
 The remaining elves were returning, deadly and furious, and the darkness that had protected them was gone.

I ignored the thought that Mom would be mad if she knew I'd skipped breakfast and hadn't brought any lunch.
 I pulled out my old, unabridged copy of Les Misérables.
 Every so often I'd try to make it through Victor Hugo's weighty classic, but so far I'd never made it past Marius' introduction.
 Having just finished up Pride and Prejudice for the third time, I was once again due to try and make it through the written inspiration to some of my favorite music.
 I hardly noticed the slow journey into town, instead caught up in a different time and place as Valjean's story started to unfold.
 All too soon, the bus pulled up to a medium-sized, two-story brick building, and five kids my age stood up to leave.
 I followed them, my heart beating a little faster with each step.
 Other kids were trickling over to the door, either from one of the other two buses, or from the smattering of cars in the parking lot.
 Before we'd even made it inside I'd realized just how much I stuck out.
 Shorts seemed to be the order of the day, knee-length khakis for the boys, and everything from mid-thigh on up for the girls.

He had never really had a woman that eager to touch him before.
 Her eagerness to touch his body made him feel a little put off.
 It was good to be touched, in fact, he craved it.
 But her eagerness highlighted to him that the body she wanted to touch was not really his.
 It was the body of Gerald, not Rodregas.
 Her body was everything that he had thought it would be, both wonderfully hard and lush.
 To say she was the most beautiful woman he had ever enjoyed touching was a ridiculous understatement.
 Imeralda reached up to his neck and pulled herself up on top of his lap.

I expected her to be a pain—it wasn’t as difficult to accept she’d kept the truth from me.
 She extracted a small package from beneath her cloak and passed it to me.
 I pulled the material aside and saw the V etched into the cover.
 I wondered what Chevelle would do if he knew she’d given it to me.
 She answered my curious gaze.
 “It’s yours, and I think you should be able to read it.” I could do nothing but nod.
 It didn’t matter.
 Her expression made it clear she considered herself forgiven.

The new chapter was on probability, which had absolutely nothing to do with the stuff they'd been working on the week before.
 I quickly decided I didn't like the new stuff as much as what I'd been studying on my own, but it was relatively easy, and almost before I knew it class had ended and it was time to go to lunch.
 My doubts about whether or not everyone would be back in school today after three nights of partying were quickly resolved as Britney and I tried to fight through the ridiculous foot traffic on our way to our lockers.
 By the time we made it to the lunch room, I was heartily sick of dodging jocks with shoulders the size of an ox.
 Why on earth did every single one of them think it was necessary to mock fight, throw balls back and forth to each other, or otherwise make a spectacle of themselves?
 My mood was further soured as we arrived to find an unmistakable circle of bystanders signaling an impending fight.
 My first instinct was to go find a teacher before the two idiots hurt each other, but while I was still looking around to see if there was an adult in the room, Britney grabbed my arm and pulled me towards the circle.
 It wasn't until we got closer that I realized there was something wrong with the circle of kids surrounding the combatants.
 Normally everyone pressed in tight for the best possible view.
 The spectators in this fight were divided into two groups, with a fairly significant space between them.

 “When we heard the alert, I turned.

 I’ve no idea why they attacked him.

An only child, he'd always considered Marie more a sister than a cousin.
 He'd adored her all his life, and that made it virtually impossible for him to refuse her anything--like an evening at a speakeasy.
 But it also made him very protective of her.
 Marie fell asleep that night dreaming of Davis.
 He was tall and handsome, just like the heroes in the books she loved to read.
 His only flaw was that he preferred making money to having fun.
 She giggled sleepily as she thought of how horrified he'd be if he ever found out where she'd been tonight.
 But then, he had to be careful if he wanted her father's approval.
 Her father was very strict, and he would never let her marry a man who was frivolous.

In spite of the phenomenal growth in global communications, transportation, commerce, finance and tourism, it is still more difficult to carry out most activities internationally than it is domestically, because the international activities are not as well organized.
 For instance, transfer of technology still involves a process that is largely trial and error.
 Firms in developing countries seeking to acquire the best available technology for importation or acquisition have to search at considerable expenditure of time and money to discover what is available within their own country as well as overseas.
 The process of identifying and commercially transferring technology can be vastly simplified and accelerated by the establishment of international technology transfer corporations, sponsored by UN agencies such as UNESCO and UNIDO, specializing in all major fields of technology.
 These corporations should be operated on a commercial, for-profit basis, though governments of developing countries could become shareholders in order to promote their formation.
 Each corporation could undertake a detailed study of available technologies in its field and offer to assist corporate customers in developing countries in selecting the most appropriate technology to meet their needs.
 The corporations could also acquire the rights to important technologies with large-scale applications and then market them widely.

Maybe the thoughts of death by poison or stabs in the dark made my stomach roil.
 Or maybe the cause was the sight of a dancer on the stage beside the bar.
 She was naked except panties sagged around her knees.
 I thought, the babe with auburn hair could be here in her place, if instead of having folks who were churchgoing gringos she had gotten born where I imagined this stoned, lost and weepy dancer had, as the fifteenth child of someone who lived in a hut beside a brown river.
 When a fellow vacated his bar stool, I excused myself from the table and moved there.
 I ordered another shot of tequila, and stared at the mirror behind the liquor shelf, wondering if I looked any different than before I surrendered to Jesus.
 I couldn’t spot a single feature that appeared more saintly or pure.
 I felt no more likely to hand over my jacket to whomever asked, let alone to throw in my shirt.

It has been amply demonstrated that the main cause of famines is not inadequate production or supply of food.
 In the modern day, famine is primarily an economic problem of entitlement, not a physical problem of shortage.
 The world possesses enough technology to double or triple the food supply in a decade, if only the world’s poorest two billion people have the purchasing power to consume it.
 So, too, the problem of employment.
 Humankind has employed itself ever since the dawn of civilization.
 So long as people have wants and are willing to work to fulfil them, there need not be a shortage of jobs for all who seek them.
 The problem today is not a shortage of money or technology.
 The problem is that we have constructed a hermetically sealed economic system that does not permit all people to express that willingness.
 Even if we reached the advanced stage of technological development that enabled one-tenth of the world’s population to produce all the goods and services to which all humanity could ever aspire, what would prevent us from distributing that work in such a manner as to provide everyone with the opportunity to acquire the purchasing power to consume their share of that over-abundance?
 The main limit on the production of sufficient goods to create prosperity for all is not material, financial, or technological.

And perhaps I’m light years from devoting myself to communion with God.
 Even on lesser matters than Zoë, such as writing books and building the Perelandra College writing programs (another of my obsessions), I hesitate to cut back in order to devote more time to communing with God.
 Even during these meditative times on the road, since Pismo Beach I have devoted as much to thoughts of the book that will come of the journey as to whether it all will help me live more like Brother Lawrence.
 I wonder, if I were given the choice between writing a wonderful book or achieving deeper communion, which would I choose?
 The woman I call Sweet still haunts me.
 I imagine if some good Christian folks would suggest that God might have sent her to me, others would assure me she was in the devil’s employ.
 Whether she came from God, the devil, or by pure coincidence is academic to me.
 If instead of her, Father Abraham would’ve appeared and reminded me that he was willing to not only surrender his son but to impale and burn his own child, I wouldn’t for a moment consider following his lead, even as far as the give her up part.
 These days, with my big kids and Pam off in the world on their own, Zoë is my only real treasure.

The last thing I'd expected was a picnic up at the top of the mountain that cradled the Graves' estate between large, rocky spurs.
 It was perfect.
 For Alec money was nothing more than a useful tool, but he understood I still wasn't comfortable having that tool used to purchase me things I didn't really need.
 I'd set out determined to hike the whole way up to the top, but I was still a little weak.
 Apparently everyone had been right about just how much blood I'd lost the night our pack had destroyed the local rival pack.
 They'd been trying to absorb Alec's pack for the last several years and he hadn't really had any other options, but I knew he still felt uneasy about what had happened.
 With his superhuman hearing and sense of smell, Alec knew I was struggling before I even did.
 He waited though until I finally admitted how tired I was, and then he scooped me up and effortlessly jogged to the top of the peak.
 "Are all of you shape shifters such showoffs?
 At least the change in altitude should bother you a little."

I could always judge how long I'd been out by my mom's expression when I came to.
 That and whether or not I'd seriously injured myself on the way down.
 She looked concerned, but not desperate yet.
 Her cell phone was in her hand, but not yet flipped open.
 It probably hadn't been more than eight or nine minutes.
 "Adri, what just happened?"
 She knew already, the psychiatrist had some fancy name for it complete with a whole list of symptoms and psychobabble garbage.
 It all boiled down to the idea that the more Mom could get me to talk about it, the sooner I'd shake off the fainting spells.
 Yeah right.
 Talking didn't make anything better; it just let him rack up a bunch of fees while I was passed out on his couch.

Higher standards of education not only raise productivity, but also stimulate higher expectations that lead to greater consumption.
 Changing attitudes toward the environment have created entirely new industries and generated new jobs in every field where impact on the environment is of concern.
 New types of organization such as fast-food restaurants, franchising and hire purchase or leasing create new jobs by hastening the growth or expanding the activities of the society.
 Shifting attitudes toward marriage and the role of women create greater demand for jobs but also more opportunities for employment, because working women consume more and require additional services.
 Anxiety regarding the impact of technological development on jobs has been aggravated by the belief – largely a hangover from the Industrial Age – that in the industrial nations automation is rapidly replacing high-wage manufacturing jobs with low-wage jobs in the service sector.
 Actually, services have had a dominant place in Western economies for most of the twentieth century.
 In the United States, they now account for 79 per cent of all jobs, 74 per cent of GDP, and generate a $56 billion trade surplus, compared to a $132 billion deficit for goods.
 Technological developments, such as advances in computers, telecommunications and medical technology, have played at least as great a role in the growth of the service sector as in manufacturing.
 New service jobs in banking, foreign trade, research, design and engineering, computer software, education, health, law, finance, business management, communications, transportation, media and entertainment demand higher levels of education and skills and offer higher pay.
 In 1992 the median manufacturing job in the US paid only $19 per week more than the median job in the service sector.

orld is changing in a manner that is uncharacteristic of the industrial Age. The economy is moving in an 92m"0manti-growth" direction and the world is changing in a "pro-growth" direction, the trend is the opposite of its predecessor, the Industrial Age. The<sep><cls>

“Yup, I’m just peachy.” “At least you can use sarcasm in a time like this,” he said and started to fight his way through the crowd.
 I followed him quickly.
 I had no desire to become separated again.
 “When can’t you use sarcasm?” I asked loudly.
 He didn’t reply to me because he had spotted Emily.
 She was slowly backing up with her palms out.
 Fire danced from her fingertips and twisted towards the troll and frost beast.
 The beast breathed and ice sprayed from its mouth.
 Emily moved her hand over and the ice evaporated into mist.
 She was holding up fine but I didn’t know how much longer.

I ran into another trio of hikers, and they told me about a new vantage point for that crooked-looking mountain I keep telling you about.
 It's on the far side, so I'm going to hike as far in as I can while it's still light today so I can make it there tomorrow with plenty of time before sunset.
 I don't want to make the hike again, so I'll probably spend all of Sunday shooting, and then hike back on Monday."
 Mom paused in her preparations to put her hand on my forehead.
 "You're not coming down with anything, are you?
 You've been so listless lately.
 Do you need me to stay home with you?"
 There it was, the perfect opportunity to get her to stay home with me.
 It would get me out of having to spend time with Brandon's increasingly annoying friends, which was what I currently wanted more than almost anything else in the world.
 Unfortunately I wanted to spend time with Brandon even more than I wanted to avoid his friends, so there wasn't really a choice.

Are you two familiar with learning forms, also known as Kata?” he asked.
 He was expecting Imeralda to shake her head but was a little surprised that Doi’van did as well.
 He clearly knew how to fight.
 Rodregas started to explain, “Forms are a series of motions that mock fighting, but also give you an opportunity to work on balance and to visualize and understand your actions and responses to different fighting situations.
 While strength and speed are important for any kind of fighting whether it is hand-to-hand or swords fighting, good technique is all about balance and center of gravity.
 What you want to learn is to keep your center low and your balance strong even when you are tired and exhausted.” Doi’van had his normal interested expression, but Imeralda looked unconvinced.
 “Ok,” he said, “time for an example.
 Imeralda stand tall,” Rodregas stated.
 She put her shoulders back, which caused her firm, rounded breast’s to thrust out.
 Rodregas didn’t think she meant the gesture to be sexual, but he hesitated at the sight of her superbly shaped body.

That was the worst mistake I made, without even realizing it.
 At the same time another Thrasher was heading in my direction, and by moving out of the way from the first one, I had placed myself in the path of the second one.
 It slammed into my side at such a great force I tasted blood in my mouth, when I hit the ground.
 Then I felt pain, saw blood, and then nothing at all.
 Chapter 4
 I heard muffled voices around me as I regained consciousness.
 My head throbbed slightly, and so did my side and my tongue.
 That explained why I had tasted blood; I must have bitten it.
 For a second I thought I had returned to my human self when I heard a blast of fire that probably came from Emily.
 “Seth when will she wake up?” a voice said.

 “Yes, Harruq?” She turned around.
 Harruq tapped his fingers against the hilts of his swords and glanced about the clearing.

Lousy song, but it brings back memories, and how they got a hold of it, I can’t imagine.
 A really, rough, live “The Sun Also Rises.”
 CM:  	I don’t—
 BG:  	Fever Tree.
 I’ll educate you, yet.
 We used to try to work up a version of “The Sun Also Rises” because I could make my voice sound like his raspy delivery—likewise Sky Saxon of The Seeds.
 Which is why “Can’t Seem to Make Her Mine” shows up on the bootleg, also.
 A better version of it, than “Sun”—actually part studio, part live, if you can dig that.
 At least, whoever put the fucker together had some chops, knew a thing or two—it’s a fairly seamless melding of two different versions of the song, incorporating a blistering solo I did on it live with a somewhat coherent rendering we put down at Ardent.
 “Can’t Seem to Make Her Mine” should have been huge for The Seeds, yet it only charted, barely.

She looked about twenty pounds heavier and it was good weight.
 Tiffanie had been clean and sober since her last relapse in the rehab center.
 They smiled at each other and commented on their vast physical changes.
 They knew their life as a couple was over and that they had both gone their separate ways, while both going in the same positive direction—off drugs—despite astronomical odds.
 The conversation they had was all about sobriety and how wonderful it was to be clean.
 They both had big smiles and clear eyes and they looked like a couple of healthy young people, and that is exactly what they were.
 I also took the opportunity to arrange a meeting at a Starbucks, a reunion of sorts.
 I had stayed in contact with Officer White by e-mailing him updates on Brandon’s progress as a courtesy to him and as a bit of a reward.
 I thanked him for busting my son.

I expected him to take one look at the sub and turn around like he'd done before, but he registered the presence of a substitute and then came inside regardless.
 It didn't make sense until the first girl all but fainted as he walked past her desk.
 Of course.
 He didn't like substitutes, and figured he had better places to be, but the draw of hero worship after having almost double-teamed Vincent was just too much to resist.
 The sub took a desultory roll, and then waved his hands at us.
 "Her notes say you're all supposed to be able to work on some kind of group project.
 Just keep it to a dull roar."
 It was like releasing a bunch of kids in a candy store and telling them to sample whatever they wanted.

They were so worn, it must have been in place for centuries.
 The leather soles of my shoes skimmed over ancient stone, the bridge curving gently before flattening out into a worn dirt path on the other side.
 It was more traveled than I would have liked, so I swung wide, through the trees instead.
 The wind shifted and the scent of roasting meat assaulted me, dragging my attention, my feet, its way.
 Despite my concerns about other elves, my stomach tightened, my mouth watering as I followed it through the trees.
 They broke into a small clearing, and there in the center stood a cloaked figure, kneeling down as he turned a meat-covered spit.
 Pressed tight behind an oak tree, I shuffled sideways to get a better view.
 I was sure it was an elf, male, from his size.
 The smell of real food was consuming, and I was watching the cooked meat roll over the flame as I moved again.
 A dry leaf crushed beneath my foot.

He'd just used the 'L-word', and my heart felt like it was tearing itself apart inside my chest.
 In the subtle shadings we girls used to measure commitment, it wasn't as good as if he'd come right out and said, 'I love you Adriana Paige', but it was still pretty good, and it was a complete first for me.
 Once I made it past the second part of his statement, I was able to start considering the first part of what he'd said.
 It was horrifying and amazing all at once, and it made complete sense.
 His mom was living in memories because the real world was just a pale shadow of her life with his father.
 Alec seemed to take my silence as condemnation, or possibly just agreement with his self-condemnation.
 "We're where the legends of succubi originated.
 Irresistible demons who drain their victims dry, who leave their lovers a hollow shell of what they were before."
 I'd finally worked through things enough inside my mind, to respond, but he bulldozed right over me.

"The brothers watched the dayborn for many turnings, but although they learned many things, they found themselves unable to learn the dayborns' language.
 Even worse, the dayborn hunters were becoming ever more skilled at tracking Inock, and they began to press him sorely."
 I felt as though I was drifting.
 The bed no longer mattered, or even seemed to exist.
 All that mattered was the story and the warm drowsiness that increased with each breath.
 "Adjam saw his brother's frustration grow, but he never suspected just how strong it'd become until two hunters brought Inock to bay, and he turned on them.
 Inock killed the first hunter and would have done likewise to the second, but Adjam sprang upon his brother, knocking him away before the second man could be harmed."
 Alec's fingers slowly caressed my stomach as he spoke.
 It should have tickled, but instead it lulled me even further towards oblivion.

Rising violence: Violence is on the increase, especially violence within society in the form of civil wars, crime and drugs.
 During the first half of 1994, 36 armed conflicts were in progress.
 During the past year, more than half a million people perished in Somalia and Rwanda alone.
 Nearly 100 less-known conflicts rage at the present moment.
 Refugees: Violence, poverty and environmental degradation are displacing people on a massive scale.
 Today there are more than 18 million refugees, far more than the number immediately following the Second World War.
 A rising tide of immigration is increasing ethnic tensions and intolerance in both industrial and developing countries.
 Debt: Outside the industrial countries, global growth in the last two decades has come from a limited number of countries in East and South East Asia.

Rodregas was not as familiar with the daemons of the Infernal Realms as he was the great beasts of the Celestial Realm.
 He sat looking at a wolf with the tail of a serpent but with large beautiful white wings.
 Then he slowly walked next to a great bull with bat wings and a head that appeared to be very human.
 While he had been drawn to the Chamber both figures repulsed him.
 They mocked the natural order.
 It was  not just that they seemed to combine multiple unconnected animals, but the size and shapes were simply wrong.

 As abruptly as that, the interplay between the two siblings ended, leaving an uncomfortable silence as odd as the affection from a moment before.
 We walked to Alec's car in silence, the pair of them apparently lost in their own thoughts, and me wondering why Alec had agreed to give me a ride home.
 I wasn't enough of a car aficionado to recognize the vehicle other than the fact that it was a matte gray and had the kind of smooth, exotic lines all of the high-end vehicles seemed to be striving for right now.
 Rachel slipped in the backseat while I was still wondering how this seemingly low-profile ride matched up against Brandon's Mustang.

He continued, “I was a squire in the Knighthood who was never raised.

 Rachel poked me in the ribs, and then went back to work on the last few details of my 'new and improved' look.

 I didn't like sitting there while Britney badmouthed Mrs. Campbell.
 I looked up during one of Britney's infrequent pauses for air, and caught Alec staring at me.
 Staring wasn't quite the right word though.
 Strangely enough, it didn't seem like he was necessarily mad, but he didn't seem happy either.
 I only caught his eyes for a few seconds before he looked away, but even his normally riveting blue eyes couldn't distract me from my inability to identify the look.
 I was used to people disliking me, ignoring me, or even occasionally liking me, but this was the first time I'd met someone who seemed to be still trying to decide what camp to join long past the time when most kids our age would have either made a decision or just decided I was weird and started ignoring me.
 Britney seemed to be getting suspicious that I wasn't really listening, so I had to make a lot of eye contact over the next few minutes.
 When I finally got a chance to look back up, Alec and his friends weren't at their table.
 Cassie caught my eye before I looked down, but she was definitely glaring.

Eugene – We never actually got to the kissing point of the relationship.

He returned to the room with the Cokes and opened the box.
 "Mmm—it smells great."
 He put a slice on a plate and handed it to her.
 "Thank you," she mumbled, not looking at him.

 He caught her free hand and squeezed it until she looked up at him.
 "It's OK.  We're friends, we like each other--nothing should make us feel uncomfortable with each other, should it?"
 She smiled then.

Rodregas violently kicked out with one leg, but his stabbing attacker avoided the blow.
 He did let up on the knife for a second though.
 Instead of following up, Rodregas used the momentum of his kick to swing his body sideways.
 Skilled, close up fighting was all about leverage.
 Instead of resisting the attacker’s strength Rodregas pushed down on the earth with his hands and lifted his body up and to the side, curling the leg he had kicked out underneath.
 He planted his foot under his body.
 His attackers seemed confused, grabbing him and trying to counter his change of position.
 Rodregas only had one leg under him, but he pushed off with it with all his strength and thrust himself up.
 It should have failed with all the men holding him down, but he now had celestial strength, and even with the knife wound he was strong.
 His attackers backed off, confused by the fact that he had gone from being their prisoner to suddenly rising.

He wanted to pull away, but did not let himself.
 He had initiated the intimacy, and it would not be fair of him to pull away because of his personal doubts.
 “Easy,” Rodregas said, “I want to go nice and slow and enjoy every step.” They kissed again, this time eagerly exploring each other’s mouth and lips.
 He ran his lips down the line of her chin.
 Though he was trying to go slowly, they quickly found themselves naked.
 He thought if he had let her, she would have jumped right on him and slid himself inside her.
 Rodregas knew that Nymphs were legendary for their enjoyment of sex, but he was a little surprised at her eagerness.
 She ran her hands and lips across his chest, seemingly fascinated by ‘his’ powerful musculature and smooth skin.
 Once again Rodregas found himself pulling away from her touch.
 He had never really had a woman that eager to touch him before.

Rachel and her sinister sidekick James, check.
 I smiled at Rachel and then flipped open my math book.
 Everything went just like normal, and promptly at five I closed my binder and started stuffing books into my backpack.
 I looked up to find Rachel standing in front of my table.
 "Are you ready?
 James had to leave early, but don't worry, we've still got a ride home."
 I think I managed to keep the disappointment off of my face.

The CIS has now been added to the traditional drugs routes emanating from the Peru–Colombia–Panama, Pakistan–Afghanistan, and Myanmar–Thailand–Laos regions.
 The drugs menace is transnational in character with far-reaching implications for societal and international peace and security.
 The countries and regions which produce these drugs, and through which the trade flows, have been afflicted by endemic violence and social turbulence.
 A similar impact occurs at the point of concentrated consumption, especially in the inner cities of America, where crime and murder rates have soared due to drug-related violence.
 Inevitably, drug trafficking is linked with illicit arms, terrorist groups and the Mafia.
 Criminal elements are increasingly gaining control over the administrative and political structures of drug-producing states, where drug-related corruption permeates the military and government.
 Neither the proliferation of small arms, nor the proliferation of drugs, nor the growth of terrorist and criminal activity can be solved as isolated problems, or by the independent initiatives of individual states.
 No country is exempt from the danger, which will continue to multiply unless checked and eradicated by concerted international action.
 Urgent steps are needed to classify and register small arms production and trade, to monitor and control their manufacture and limit their export.
 Agreements are needed to reduce production and severely restrict sales.

The dramatic economic advancement of the Republic of Ireland – whose per capita GDP rose within the past 20 years from less than 60 per cent that of UK to 95 per cent in dollar terms and 130 per cent in terms of purchasing power parity – has eliminated the disparity between Ireland and Ulster and fostered among the Irish in both countries a sense of pride, an expansion of employment opportunities, and a more focused channelling of social energies into productive activities.
 Economic growth in the region was augmented by the systematic efforts of the British government to eliminate the active discrimination against the minority Catholic population of North Ireland in housing and employment as well as the segregation of Catholic and Protestant education.
 Violence has subsided, yet a political solution still defies the policymakers, because some of the root causes of the problem buried far in the past have not yet been adequately addressed.
 A steady and concerted effort for permanent solution in Ireland will demonstrate the possibility and provide the knowledge necessary for addressing other intractable communal problems around the world.
 A comprehensive approach to a permanent solution must include social, economic, education and cultural elements.
 The principle illustrated here is that long-standing military conflicts can be resolved by political initiative and obstinate political conflicts can be resolved by economic strategies rooted in the principles of equity and ethics.
 The opening up of economic relations between the USA and China by President Nixon has made war between the two countries almost unthinkable.
 There are no serious conflicts in the world today that cannot be resolved through consultation, consensus and ‘win-win’ formulas.

I opened my mouth to ask what would happen after that, but he was already gone, moving so quickly through the darkness that I wasn't even sure which direction he'd headed.
 I locked the door for the first time since we'd arrived in Sanctuary, turned on all the downstairs lights, and then slowly walked upstairs.
 It was crazy to be scared that Alec had somehow missed someone, but I couldn't shake the feeling I was being watched.
 Once I finally made it upstairs, I checked both rooms, and the bathroom, before finally relaxing a little.
 I showered quickly, carefully making sure the smell of alcohol and cigarette smoke was out of my hair, and then changed into clean clothes and collapsed onto my bed.
 I was exhausted, but I couldn't fall asleep.

They both watched him with steady eyes.
 One reached out with a huge paw and dragged the dead bear’s body closer.

 The danger of the Dire Cats was crystal clear.

 The good news was that they both seemed very full, and if anything, had a sleepy look to them.
 Rodregas guessed that he had awakened them from a nap.
 Rodregas had to remind himself that he needed to develop an understanding with the lionesses.
 Predators like them worked on a very simple alpha relationship; the strong ruled.

They were probably wishing it was them instead of me cradled against Brandon's yummy chest.
 I tried not to radiate too much contentment, but rather suspected I failed.
 Vincent wasn't really driving any faster than before, but the fact that we were going up and down slopes I wouldn't have thought could be driven made his current speed reckless.
 Even with Brandon's arm stopping me from flying out of the pickup, I still had a couple of moments where my heart shot up to the top of my throat.
 He of course remained frustratingly calm, even when we hit a bump with enough force to nearly send everyone flying out of the bed.
 The other girls were trying hard to appear nonplussed.
 They were probably even fooling the boys, but they weren't enjoying themselves.
 I was nearly sick by the time the track we were following leveled out, but there was just enough light left for me to enjoy the last of the sunset as we finished up the last ten minutes of the drive.

Still.” He was gone.
 He moved so fast it took a moment to understand.
 The hood of the cloak was drawn over my head, Chevelle standing a good distance away, facing the trees.
 I was watching him as two men drew near.
 I hadn’t seen them; they must have been concealed, or camouflaged by magic as I had been days before.
 The tassels decorating their long robes identified them as members of council, but I wasn’t familiar with the two.
 They mustn’t have been from the village.

While hunters, they are also healers and not as vicious as most of the others.
 It might also cause less confusion if you are able to gain both Infernal and Celestial great sigils to have ones that share some similarities.” Rodregas nodded and walked toward where Doi’van had pointed, having to circle around what appeared to be a bear with the front feet of a stork and the over large head of an owl.
 Rodregas felt his skin crawl and he almost left the chamber, but then the cat shape behind the daemon became clear.
 The Daemonic shape seemed to be missing the odd combinations of the others.
 It looked like the large Panthers he had heard of that were found in the southern jungles.
 It had no mane like the lions he knew and its fur was black.
 In fact it was the darkest black he had ever seen.
 This was why, at first, he had not seen the shape in the dark.
 It seemed to soak in and blend in with the night.

Sure enough, it was a dwarf but there was something strangely different about this particular dwarf.
 He just walked toward us as if he wasn't afraid that I might put an arrow through his head.
 Just as I was about to release my arrow, the dwarf cried, “Please stop!” I don’t know why I listened to him but I didn’t pull the string.
 The dwarf was acting different than the others; its pudgy eyes were filled with fear at the sight of my arrow.
 “Why?” Seth growled.
 “Your kind has done nothing good to us except make us confused and our lives more complicated.” The dwarf looked startled.
 “Oh you’ll have to excuse my brethren; they have a tendency to be rather annoying.” He took a long frightened look at Seth’s sword.
 “Good sir, before you try to slay me, I have a message to deliver from her majesty.” I lowered my bow because I had a feeling I wanted to know what this message was.
 If it was a lie, Seth and I could kill him anyway in a blink of an eye.

 They had freed the dragon and they both were petting its head.
 It stretched its wings and they both had to duck to avoid being hit.

 “I mean they are our friends, best buds, you get my drift.

Unbelievable.
 He was supposed to bring drugs to a hotel room, but because Brandon owed everybody money, his credit to be fronted drugs was not good, so he went to the drug deal without the drugs, planning to get the money first then go back for them.
 When Brandon knocked on the hotel room door, it opened and an army of police officers darting in from all directions greeted him.
 They wrestled him to the ground, cuffed him and began their search of him and his vehicle and, later, his house.
 Brandon had been recorded agreeing to the deal and he had paraphernalia in his possession.
 Unfortunately for the police, they chose to drop the net on him when he had hit bottom and couldn’t afford the drugs they hoped they would catch him with.
 During his 23-hour period in jail, the narcotics officers shook him down for everything he was worth.
 The process of getting one drug dealer to set up the next is as old as the trade itself (my own brother had done it over 35 years before).
 During the interrogation, which included the usual scare tactics, the cops showed him a great deal of information they had collected on him.
 Even though they didn’t have the bust they wanted, they had him verbally agreeing to provide drugs and several people willing to testify that Brandon had provided them with Oxy and other drugs.

I drew a deep breath and nodded.
 "Okay, I don't remember exactly what she said, but she was mad at the other girl, Lucy.
 Something about staying away from a boy, I don't remember if she said his name.
 Then Jasmin said she didn't believe Lucy was sorry, and that she'd kill her if Lucy didn't stay away from him."
 Brandon nodded slowly.
 "The boy's name's Ben.
 I'm not sure why she's fixated on him the way she has, or why she views Lucy as such a deadly threat to her chances with him, but it's essentially that simple."
 I felt like my head should be reeling from the sheer stupidity.
 Even in a town this small, it didn't seem like the competition for the available males should be a matter for death threats.
 Brandon took my head shaking as denial of what he'd said, rather than disbelief regarding the situation.

It was rare that I suffered from a panic attack in Alec's presence but the reference to what I'd lost, combined with my dreaded nickname nearly did the trick.
 As my pulse sped up again Alec pulled me in close.
 "Sorry about that.
 You do have to admit, it would help explain why you're still here."
 "Right, gorgeous, rich boy who also happens to be the next best thing to a super hero.
 I must be out of my mind not to run for the hills."
 "You don't like it when I spend money on you and the more involved you get with me the less likely it is I'll be able to protect you."
 "If I let you buy me something will you quit trying to scare me off?"
 "No, but it would make me feel better."

I kept my eye on the faery men, waiting for one of them to turn around and notice us hiding in the trees.
 I ducked behind a tree and looked over just in time to see Emily trip and fall out of her bush.
 The faery and dwarves looked at her in surprise.
 I guess they’ve never seen a teenage half-ling girl fall out of a bush before.
 “Am I interrupting something?” Emily asked with a gulp.
 The faery men drew their double swords and charged at her.
 I released an arrow and it buried itself in one of their necks.
 It fell backward and they turned to my hiding spot, searching for me.
 Two knives flew and a dwarf and man collapsed on the ground.
 I saw Jason hide behind his tree again.

The phenomenon of growing violence in an age of increasing affluence seems to contradict the thesis that poverty is one of the major causes of violence, until we realize that the increasingly visible signs of prosperity the world over raise the expectations and aggravate the sense of deprivation and revolt among those that have been by-passed by the general progress.
 Greater political and social freedom can only further magnify this tendency.
 This suggests that violence at the international, national and community levels cannot and will not be eradicated before poverty itself has been abolished, and that, if poverty is left unaddressed at its source, further economic progress is likely further to aggravate conflict in society, unless we are able to extend the benefits of progress to everyone.
 This realization would be quite disconcerting were it not for the fact that we are fast approaching the time when both these persistent ills of humankind can be banished forever – the way slavery and colonialism were banished in the past.
 The recognition that it is neither desirable nor possible to go backwards adds urgency to our efforts to move forward.
 Revolutions of the past have been partial and localized negative reactions against an existing social order, and benefited only a small part of society that, in turn, blindly resisted change.
 They resulted in war and usually much destruction.
 The revolution of rising expectations is a positive, constructive movement spreading to encompass people at all levels of all societies around the globe, and pressing for the establishment of a higher social organization that can meet the expectations of all humanity.
 But the energies liberated by this revolution have to be properly converted into an evolutionary effort for development, otherwise they will fly off in unwanted directions.
 Society must provide the conditions and opportunities for these energies to express themselves positively and constructively in pursuit of their own fulfilment.

volution are the most important elements of a more progressive society. The energy that is liberated from poverty and violence can be converted into a positive, constructive effort for development and to create the conditions and opportunities for the development of the new society.<eop><eod> The story of the 92m"0mThe Great Fire"<cls>

I wanted to turn around and go back the other way, but there was a chance that Jasmin had already seen me, and if so I couldn't afford to look like I was scared of her.
 The fact I actually was terrified she was going to snap and start trying to kill people was irrelevant.
 If I could convince her I wasn't scared, I was less likely to get hurt.
 I kept walking, not necessarily steering closer to the three-quarter wall the boy was leaning against, but also being very careful not to go out of my way to stay further away from them either.
 As I got close to the pair, a little more of the boy became visible, reaffirming my impression that he wasn't happy to be talking to her.
 His shoulders looked unnaturally tight and he was shaking his head slowly from side to side.
 Locked as I was into my course, I couldn't help but hear them both as I got closer.
 "I can't do this, Jasmin.
 I've been meaning to tell you for a while, but I was afraid of how you'd react."
 I half stumbled at the raw pain in his voice.

And he consorts with Nymphs and Infernals, not people of the Celestial Realm.

 “I but follow the rules of the Order as they have stood for unknown centuries, Ambassador.
 While there are many things that go into raising a squire to knighthood, the tournament is the exception.
 The rules are simple; win and you win knighthood.
 While undue bloodshed can disqualify you, a single death during the tournament is not unusual.” While the Grand Marshal spoke, he did not look at the audience.
 He looked at Van’dret and he did not look happy at the interruption.
 “But clearly he already has a greater sigil; no man can fight like that who does not have one.

I had to break it, even if it meant further examining all of the holes inside me that I'd spent so many months struggling to ignore.

 It was killing him, boring him silly.
 But, he came home every night with a grin on his face.
 Ate dinner with us, spot on 4:45, like you could set your fucking watch by it, and then, evenings when he played, he’d sheepishly pick up his little case, which usually sat in the back closet next to his shoe tree, and he would toss off a sad smile and go play till God knows what hour.

These men did not fight with their hearts.
 They fought with their heads, and such foolishness could not be tolerated.
 “Fine, I’ll show you a real warrior,” he said.
 His muscles tensed, his legs bulged, and then he charged the two, oblivious to his own safety.
 Overwhelming any of their attacks, he was a moving mountain of muscle, dangerous and powerful.
 The meager defenses of the guards faltered.
 One tried to block as Condemnation came for his head.
 The blade broke through and cleaved his skull in two.
 The other brought his sword down too late.

 My war masters at the palace would say you two are too old to learn the staff, but it is the way that I know.” “Sir Paladin,” he said to Rodregas, imposing the unearned honor title.
 “I assume with your training from all your ex-knights that you know how to use the staff?” As Doi’van spoke he looked at how Rodregas was holding the staff.
 “Fight with a staff?” Rodregas responded in surprise.
 “No, can’t say that I ever have.
 The weapons of the Knight are the sword, the mace, the lance and the bow.
 Those are the weapons of a warrior,” he stated.
 “And what do you do when facing a warrior in full plate armor?” asked Doi’van.
 “Even chain mail can stop an arrow or the edge of a sword.
 And while a mace is great against chain, crushing your opponent and breaking their bones, such tactics take far too long against plate armor.” Rodregas was not sure what to say to that question.

 Alec was uncharacteristically early, already sitting at his normal desk.
 He looked up and briefly met my eyes when I reached my desk, but there wasn't even a trace of acknowledgment in his gaze.
 Mrs. Alexander started class, reviewed a couple of points that other groups needed clarified, and then released us to work on our assignments.

We plummeted to the ground, falling closer and closer… Oh man, I thought and closed my eyes.
 Don’t look, don’t look, don’t look… “Really!” Seth yelled at the sky.
 “This brings new meaning to ‘things can’t get any worse!’” I gripped furiously to the limp dragon.
 I was falling to my death: so this is how it was going to end.
 I never pictured it this way; I thought I would die a little more heroically, not screaming like a little girl.
 “Not now Seth,” Emily screamed at him.
 “Everyone think!” “How can I think,” I screeched back, “when the ground is rushed towards me at full speed?” “I don’t know Jazell, just think if you want to live,” she said quickly.

Everyone had pretty much just pretended like I didn't exist before.
 Now, with Brandon having taken an interest in me, I got everything from simple acknowledgment of my presence to obvious dislike, and even a couple of people who looked like they wanted to take Britney's place.
 I suppose some people would have been thrilled by the chance to join the top of the social food chain, but it mostly just disgusted me.
 I politely rebuffed the scavengers, ignored the haters, and carefully acknowledged the rest without giving them anything else to go on.
 It was a rather depressing exercise.
 By the time Mrs. Sorenson had fired a couple of ridiculously obscure questions at me, I found the good feelings I'd managed to carry away from the mayor's visit the night before had pretty much evaporated.

 I convinced myself I was imagining the way he studied me as he sat against the downed tree.
 He had no idea what I was thinking.
 It was the furthest thing from his mind.
 “No?” I asked, unable to mask the tremor in my voice.
 “Magic first.” That wasn’t exactly a relief.
 It was obvious he saw my anxiety, but I couldn’t be sure he wasn’t enjoying it.
 He just remained sitting there.

"Donovan has very inflexible standards when it comes to some things.
 Dancing happens to be one of them.
 In fact, I don't think I'll ever forget the expression on Jasmin's face when he told her she could go clubbing all she wanted after he judged her suitably proficient in real dancing.
 He said he wouldn't have her 'seduced by throbbing beats and soulless contact' before he'd at least exposed her to proper dance steps."
 I felt a giggle surge past my lips, and pressed them tight before I could completely embarrass myself.
 "That's amazing.
 My dad thought knowing how to dance would make my first dance easier.
 It turned out to be a complete waste of time.

I opened my mouth to protest, but moving much too quickly, even with his painful-looking limp, to be a normal human, he'd already vanished around the corner.
 I stood awkwardly in the doorway for several minutes, but I couldn't resist the draw of all those books forever.
 I finally broke down and started tracing various spines as I decided which one I'd start with.
 Unfortunately I found the textbooks before I made a final decision, and then guilt over how poorly I was doing in Biology and Spanish won out.
 I was halfway through my second re-read of my Biology chapter when I heard a quiet knock at the door.
 Rachel giggled a little at my guilty start.

 It was probably about as good of a chance to find out what was going on under the surface as I was going to get, but something inside me shied away.
 It was like I'd be entering a new world, one in which some of my illusions would be shattered.
 I'd have to face a colder interpretation of certain people's actions.
 Brandon successfully defused any awkwardness, chuckling as he pulled into the school parking lot.
 "You really didn't know any of that?"
 I shook my head, more or less speechless, and he reached out and playfully tapped the side of my face with one finger.
 The touch left my skin warm and tingling.

At the edge of the town, he found many frantic tracks fleeing west.
 He followed them, wincing as some ended in dried smears of red upon the grass.
 Others led far past the others.
 They ended at once in an enormous pool of blood, leaving the town a somber image in the distance.
 Chasing them the whole while were twin sets of tracks, one of enormous weight, the other light as a feather.

I flinched, afraid at the quickness and strength of the move, but he only trailed an index finger gently down my arm, over the design, to stop in the center of my palm.
 My arm relaxed into his grip.
 “You like it?
 Ruby did it.
 It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” His finger stayed on my palm as he looked up at me.
 His eyes lingered on my mouth for a moment and then met mine, piercing.
 “A hawk?” It seemed like an accusation, but I had no idea why.

Oh, naw, no.
 I mean, I was about five and my parents had this set of records, this Reader’s Digest set, and there was this one song that I fell in love with on it, used to go around the house, scatting it, at five.
 It was “I Can’t Get Started” by Bunny Berigan.
 I don’t know.
 I can still play that one.
 CM:  	So, you grew up in a musical house?
 Music was part of your everyday life?
 BG:  	(laughs) Shit, no.

Her cell phone was in her hand, but not yet flipped open.
 It probably hadn't been more than eight or nine minutes.
 "Adri, what just happened?"
 She knew already, the psychiatrist had some fancy name for it complete with a whole list of symptoms and psychobabble garbage.
 It all boiled down to the idea that the more Mom could get me to talk about it, the sooner I'd shake off the fainting spells.
 Yeah right.
 Talking didn't make anything better; it just let him rack up a bunch of fees while I was passed out on his couch.

Tears ran down his cheeks.
 The thought was too painful to bear.
 Around 1:00 he dragged himself upstairs, even though he knew he'd be unable to sleep.
 He took three Advil and lay down, throwing his arm over his eyes.
 He dozed fitfully, finally coming wide awake just after 6:00.
 He wished he could sleep.
 Sleep would be an escape.
 He couldn't bear the images that had come on the heels of his newest realization--images of Marie surrounded by children, making dinner for them, for a husband, kissing him, making love with him .

I opened my mouth to ask him what he meant, only to be distracted by the sound of the Jeep's engine as it rolled to a stop on the cement pad.
 As I looked back, Alec's eyes captured me.
 "You're sure this is what you want?"
 I managed a nod, and then the downstairs door crashed open.
 "Adri, honey.
 Where are you?"
 Alec was gone when I looked back.
 Only the slight sway of my curtains gave evidence he'd just casually jumped out of my second-story window.
 I heard Mom's equipment bags hit the floor one after another.

A good fighter, of course, knows you do not let an opponent recover.
 His attacker came in hard and fast.
 Rodregas never saw the blow to his face, but luckily it was not a direct hit as Rodregas was already moving in close.
 Before the attacker could deliver another blow he was inside his opponents swing.
 Getting close is not always the best strategy on a powerful larger opponent.
 His attacker’s large hand reached for his face.
 Rodregas turned into his weight and tried to use his momentum to drive the large body off balance.

Qurrah chuckled at the act while his concealed whip writhed about his arm.
 “What is going on?” asked a whiny little voice.
 From the lone tent, a skinny man in purple and red emerged stinking of perfume.
 “It is nothing,” one of the guards said.
 Harruq held in a chuckle.
 It was obvious the guard had little love for the disgusting noble.
 “Nothing?
 By Ashhur, it is the smelliest, dirtiest nothing I have ever seen.

These events raise questions about the rights of both nations and their citizens that have to be addressed theoretically before the role of international organizations in these affairs can be determined properly.
 Does a minority group within a country have the right to proclaim itself independent on the basis of its desire for self-governance and in defiance of the claims of the majority on the property and resources they possess?
 Does a national government, whether elected or in power by force, that is unable to protect its citizens against famine and civil strife have the right to insist on its sovereignty and independent action in the face of the persecution or extermination of its own people?
 What is the responsibility of the international community for preventing or alleviating crises within societies?
 What should be the limits placed on international involvement in the internal affairs of countries that, at least momentarily, are unable to help themselves?
 The sanctity of the sovereign state, like the sanctity of private property in a capitalist society, is a fundamental principle of the nation state system on which the present world community is based.
 Like the protectors of private property, the guardians of the sovereign state vigorously resist each attempt to limit its scope or qualify its power – although in both instances there are obvious and well-recognized limits and qualifications.
 The sensitivity over the issue of sovereignty – especially among former colonies and victims of imperialist aggression – is quite understandable in view of the fact that the emergence of modern nation states over the last two centuries occurred during a period when imperialist wars and colonial conquests were accepted as part of the normal conduct of international relations.
 It is a measure of the world’s progress in this century that this standard of conduct is no longer tolerated by the international community.
 The formulation of current policy on racial memories of past exploitation or persecution is no more appropriate or conducive to human progress, however, than the false conception of policies based on an exaggerated sense of pride or egocentric self-importance derived from the glory of forceful conquest in the past.

"I'd have to confirm that.

 Mom stood there with the phone up against her ear for several seconds before shaking herself and looking at me.
 "That was some kind of promoter.
 She wants me to go out and shoot a fashion show in Paris.
 For a week and a half, and then another one in Italy.
 I've never heard of either of the shows, but she's offering me twenty thousand dollars for just three weeks."

I felt a stab of guilt for the selfishness of the thought while looking over such loss, but I waved it away and tucked the pages under my mattress.
 Lying back on the bed as I looked up at my mother’s pendant, I closed my eyes, trying to remember… I could see her face.
 Her straight nose, her gentle smile.
 Her long hair waved around her shoulders, stray locks caught by the wind.
 She wore a white dress with bell sleeves and a low-cut neck.
 Her pendant hung there.
 It started to refract light, but there was only darkness around my vision of her.

 The masterful jazz artists playing in side-street storefronts for nothing but spare change.
 By the end of Mardi Gras, at midnight, while we were entering the rundown neighborhood between the French Quarter and our car, a policeman warned us not to go that way.
 On this night every year, he assured us, coloreds roamed the streets hunting for white folks to butcher.
 I thought, who could blame them?
 Still, I wasn't ready to die.
 But with three of us, we might survive.
 A few blocks into the neighborhood, we got invited to a house party, where a gathering of charming black folks hosted us most of the night.

 He let me sit there for a couple of seconds, and then reached out and used one gentle finger to nudge my chin up.

Maybe I still wasn't recovered from my ordeal on Friday; I felt like I was missing something obvious.

 "There are two in-crowds here; Brandon's group, which consists of all of the athletes and cheerleaders, and Alec's group, which is about half the size, and outside of his immediate friends is made up of a few geeks and misfits.
 You were on the border of getting in with Brandon, but just threw all of that away to save Alec's little sister when he's too much of a coward to do it himself."
 I wanted to protest, to explain why everyone should be able to get along, or point out that despite Brandon's obvious appeal, it was his friend who was wrong, but Britney had already turned and stalked off.
 I probably would've spent the next few minutes refining my arguments for the next time we talked, but the last thing Britney had said finally sank in.
 His sister.

“Not exactly” he said.
 “I saw movement a few times.
 I just thought it might be them.
 I did not know for sure,” he explained.
 Doi’van asked Imeralda, “Did you know they were tracking us?” “No, I had no clue.” she said looking embarrassed.
 She then added, “I am not really a great tracker.
 I mean, our Paladin was easy enough to find but tracking Dire Cats through the forest, that would require true skill.” “But you did not sense them at all?” asked the Hellborn again.
 “No,” she shook her head.
 “Why?” she asked, her voice curious on his repeated questioning.
 “Because I am wondering if our ‘Paladin’ has a connection to the Dire Cats.

Brandon shook his head and flashed another of his winning smiles, albeit one with an overtone of sympathy.
 "I'm sure it isn't as bad as that."
 I wanted to disagree, to go into detail about why my life had just taken a turn for the worse, but something about his manner was suddenly distant.
 I thought about calling him out on it, but with my life suddenly looking like I was all but friendless, that didn't seem like such a good idea.
 Without really meaning to I'd managed to alienate just about everyone at school.
 Brandon already had plenty of reasons not to be with me, it was the height of stupidity to give him any more.
 I could probably deal with not having a boyfriend, even assuming that was what we were right now.
 Going half a year without anyone to talk to because my mom was wrapped up with her art and everyone else in the town thought I was stuck-up would be more than I could take.
 The thought was enough to leave me speechless for the entire drive home.
 Brandon seemed content to leave me alone with my thoughts as he sped around the various turns at speeds that normally would've made me protest.

Shattered pieces of wood filled the air.
 His opponent flew out of the saddle, an ungainly sight, and landed hard on the arena floor.
 He did not get back up.
 After a few minutes the official signaled Rodregas’ victory.
 Rodregas headed back to Doi’van who said, “I don’t think that technique is what the knights had in mind.” His voice showed his personal pleasure, knowing that a move he had taught Rodregas lead to his victory.
 Rodregas nodded and said, “Decided that my advantage of strength was being matched by armor and steed, so it was time to use agility.

 It seemed impossible he would be unsure, that a glorious being like him could ever need anything I could provide, but I couldn't deny it was there.
 There was no way of knowing what it was, but I didn't care.
 Whatever it was he needed I wanted to give him.

 “Let us hope it does not come to that, Dieredon.

I needed to give him a reason to stay interested in me, but nothing came to mind.
 As we pulled to a stop, the quiet hum of a cellphone on vibrate broke the strange paralysis that'd gripped me for the last twenty seconds.
 Brandon's grin was more than a little sheepish as he fished his phone out of a front pocket and checked to see who was calling.
 I didn't need his groan to know it was one of his friends.
 A selfish urge to try and make him ignore the call and continue to focus on me momentarily flared up, but I suppressed it.
 It was such a petty thing to do, and even worse was probably the quickest way to demolish whatever interest he might have towards me.
 I might be almost completely naive when it came to dating, but anyone who'd read more than a couple books, or sat through eight or nine chick flicks, totally knew that the quickest way to drive a guy off was to become controlling and manipulative.
 Unless maybe you were a cheerleader and you were talking about a guy who was used to dating cheerleaders.

 Now that he'd told her he loved her, had opened his heart to her completely, he couldn't bear the thought that she might not walk back into his arms.
 So when he at last saw her moving through the fog, he ran to snatch her up.
 "Marie," he sighed into her hair.
 She could barely breathe but didn't want to be released.
 When he at last set her down, she continued to cling to him.
 "I wish you didn't have to go to work today."
 He was surprised by her words.

Harruq stayed far from Celed, the elven side of town, since they sent all their children to be raised in Nellassar, deep in the heart of the Erze forest.
 It was the human children, especially the poor and the destitute, that Harruq sought.
 Of course, none would be out playing, not with so many dead and missing.
 He would need to take different measures.
 Not far from their home, a ratty building operated throughout the night.
 It was Maggie’s Place, half tavern and half orphanage.
 Maggie enjoyed the free labor and the ability to rant and slap her orphan workers without fear of reprisal while still maintaining the image of a heart of gold to her regulars.
 The tavern filled the first floor, while the orphanage and a few modest rooms for rent composed the second.
 Harruq stepped into the alley beside the tavern and looked up.

Alec's expression was remarkable in that I'd never seen anyone look so full of life while simultaneously failing to betray even the slightest hint of emotion.
 He didn't even open his mouth as he reached into his bag and pulled out a bundle of densely-packed typewritten pages.
 The arrogance of it all.
 He hadn't even bothered to consult with me before typing up an answer that was probably completely off base.
 I pulled out my shabbier, but correct, answer and mirrored his action, tossing my bundle on his desk before looking down at his report.
 I skimmed through Alec's answer and felt my anger joined by surprise and just the slightest touch of admiration.
 He struck on exactly the same theory as I had, and done at least as good of job explaining it.
 Maybe even better considering that he took the time to review some of the underlying theory we'd been taught in class.
 I'd just jumped right into the answer.

"Nothing's changed.
 We'll just proceed as before.
 Rest now, and should the worst come to pass I'll send Donovan to you."
 A few seconds later Alec and I were outside the cabin, walking back in the direction of the waiting motorcycle.
 I reached out to take his hand, and felt a glimmer of relief when he didn't reject the gesture as he had with Mallory.
 "Alec, was the letter from Donovan?"
 I had to repeat the question again before he shook himself and nodded.
 "I've been running letters back and forth between the two of them since I was ten.
 I don't come out here very much, but I make the trip as often as it's safe to do so.
 They both live for those letters."

“Fly, Sonowin,” the elf shouted.
 “Fly safe!”
 Dieredon leapt from Sonowin’s back, the blades on his bow gleaming.
 He fell through the air, the long spike on the bottom aimed directly for Velixar’s head.
 “Master!” Qurrah shouted again, shoving his body against Velixar’s.
 His concentration broken, Velixar lost his control of the black fog.
 The darkness swirled inward as if Velixar were the center of a giant drain.
 The blackness filled him, surrounded him, and consumed him.

Come now, let’s study.” I hesitated.
 Evelyn had mentioned me, but not accusingly?
 Surely Junnie would have more to say.
 She placed a gentle hand on my shoulder and led me in.
 “What shall we do today?” I went back over our conversation, trying to find some meaning.
 Inspiration, or maybe distraction, hit me as I recalled the dark-headed stranger.
 “Lineages.” Junnie raised an eyebrow as I sped to the study, but I’d worry about Evelyn later.
 This was my chance to find out about this Chevelle Vattier.
 After a dozen or so volumes, my determination began to falter.
 There were so many lineages, but I needed something on the northern clans, something on Vattier, and Junnie didn’t have that.

 Ahrqur nodded, his eyes seething.
 Velixar reached out and placed his hand on the elf’s forehead.
 Qurrah watched as smoke rose from their contact, yet neither flinched.
 When the necromancer drew back his hand, a strange symbol lay overtop the faint scarring of the slanted Y.
 It was of a fallen man wreathed in flame.

Even the feeling like a rock in my belly went away.
 Love heals.
 Along with The Practice of the Presence of God and some mysteries, I have been reading about Feodor Dostoyevski's philosophical positions, because the issues he tackled a century and a half ago are still remarkably current.
 In Dostoyevski the Thinker, I discovered a passage written following the death of his first wife.
 Since I have the book with me, I pull into a turnout overlooking the Pacific, find the passage and reread it.
 "To love someone as oneself, in accordance with Christ's commandment, is impossible.
 The love of personality is binding on earth.
 The self stands in the way.
 Christ could do it, but Christ was an eternal ideal, toward which man strives and must strive, by the law of nature.
 Meanwhile, after the appearance of Christ, as the ideal of man in the flesh, it became as clear as day that the highest, the final development of personality must come to this: that the person should recognize and with the full force of his nature be convinced that the highest someone can make of his self is to annihilate this self, as it were—to give it totally to each and every one, individually and unselfishly.

 If you somehow survive everything that's about to happen, it would leave you forever hungering for another touch, but never able to fulfill that desire."
 I placed a hand on his lips before he could ramp back up to another diatribe.

Harruq unhooked his belt and placed his swords in a corner, brushing their hilts against his fingertips.

 “I’m not sure about the other way around.”
 Harruq shrugged.

Then his cousin is slain bearing a message to this town, his head left at the gate of our city.

 Dieredon watched him, amazed just how young the man could still look in the moonlight.
 He was a year beyond forty, yet he commanded the entire Neldaren army.
 Publicly, he handled the weight wonderfully, but when prying eyes were gone, his all-too-human fear and doubt showed.

 According to some mysterious cosmic whimsy or brutal plan, Eric had to die and I didn’t.
 So I filed the matter away with other mysteries, of which life offers plenty.
 But on this trip with all its remembering, I may solve the mystery.
 The End of Something Else
 A couple weeks after Eric's funeral, Cliff and I decided we should quit school and move to San Francisco.
 When school let out that day, we went up the street to La Mesa Junior High and found my mom grading papers on the patio behind her classroom.
 We told her our plans and listened while she recited all the reasons leaving now, three months short of graduation, was all wrong.
 She even tried to bribe us, offering to help with money if we would wait until June and apply to a San Francisco college.

On a Friday evening, Eric, Kenny Neidermeyer, Bill Torrey and I split a magnum of champagne on the pretense of celebrating Kenny’s parents’ divorce, which had gotten finalized that week.
 We had no other plans, so I suggested we visit the basketball game, since Karen’s wave and smile might revive my hope and cheer me.
 The game was against our team’s rival, Grossmont High School.
 My mother graduated there.
 The gym was ancient.
 The double entry doors each featured a quartet of small windows.
 When the gatekeeper refused to let us in because the tickets were sold out, Kenny’s usual good nature expired.
 He raised a fist as though to sock the gatekeeper, a boy in an ROTC costume.
 But instead of punching the kid, he drove his fist through one of the small windowpanes.
 The gatekeeper hollered.

They seemed to relax a little as Chevelle shook his head and brought his horse back to pace.
 I thought I knew what they were thinking.
 Idiot.
 Ruby answered, “Hmm,” with a cocked eyebrow as she turned to follow the group.
 They were mostly silent the rest of the day, until we stopped for the night.
 The group split after dinner as Anvil and Grey positioned themselves on rocks at the perimeter of our camp.
 Ruby hung out by Grey and Steed busied himself as Chevelle paced stiffly around the camp.
 I was bored again, with everyone entertaining themselves, so I leaned back against a rock and pulled my pack to my lap.
 I wrapped my cloak loosely around me and positioned my legs so I could place the book there and, hopefully, not be found out.
 I wondered how many more days of traveling we’d have.

Van’dret almost felt his eye brows rise, “of course, but what should I watch out for?

 “Oh, don’t misjudge my words.
 I did not mean to imply any misdeeds of our valiant Knights of the Soaring Heavens.
 I am not aware of any of them doing much of anything, much less kill an Immortalist.” “Than what should I keep my eye out for?” asked Van’dret.

 Their orcish features lent them no kindness, and a few children even threw rocks until the guards shooed them away.

 Doi’van walking in unaware of the situation would have been very embarrassing.
 Rodregas had suggested to Imeralda that they should stop in case Doi’van walked in, but she had shown no signs of caring and quickly took the thought away from him with her actions.

They establish orderly and peaceful processes for conflict resolution within society.
 In addition, elected governments find it extremely difficult to win public support for initiating and sustaining wars in which the country’s own citizenry must fight, except in order to rebuff or forestall external aggression, as illustrated by domestic opposition to America’s role in Vietnam.
 War is the engine of dictatorial power.
 Peace is the social dividend of democracy.
 Peace is not merely the absence of war.
 It is a settled, stable, secure condition which thrives on a foundation of political maturity, social freedom and economic well-being.
 A world in which all major military powers – with the present exclusion of China – have democratic governments removes the ideological basis and political pressure for confrontation between states.
 If it is maintained, the adoption of democratic forms of government by the nations of Eastern Europe and the developing world will help ensure peaceful relations between states, which is the most fundamental precondition for accelerated economic development.
 The marriage of democracy and disarmament can transform the world – abolishing wars, eliminating nuclear arsenals, liberating hundreds of billions of dollars for building a better common future.
 In economic terms, the shift to democratic government presents an opportunity for more rapid development in these countries.

The two brothers lived in the poorest part of town, sheltered in an old building long abandoned.

As he retched on his knees, he looked about, discerning his location.
 He was beside the building the two elves were in, directly underneath their windows.
 He could see the tips of their arrows sticking out, glinting in torchlight.
 Two adjacent homes were already ablaze, their occupants still inside.
 Qurrah turned and grabbed the frame of the door.
 “Burn!” he shouted, loud enough for the elves to hear.
 The wood blackened, smoke billowed from his hands, and then the entire building erupted as if bathed in oil.
 Qurrah laughed, untouched by the heat.
 He could not say the same for the elves, and as their pained screams reached his ears he only laughed louder.

I already wished I could take it back, but it was too late.
 It took less than half a second for him to figure out who I was talking about.
 "They don't hate you.
 A few of them are scared almost senseless, but nobody hates you."
 "They were willing to kill me.
 They wanted to trade me back to Brandon."
 It came out as something less than a whisper, but apparently Alec's hearing was acute enough to catch that too.
 Alec drew me close, heedless of the open door and the twenty staring kids.
 He placed the side of his face against mine and whispered into my ear.

Harruq nodded, again saying nothing.
 “Calm yourself,” Qurrah whispered to his brother as the two marched in front of the guards toward the main streets.
 “Trying,” Harruq whispered back.
 They marched at sword point.
 Onlookers cackled as they passed, figuring the two were thieves or vagrants caught brawling.
 Their orcish features lent them no kindness, and a few children even threw rocks until the guards shooed them away.
 The whole while Harruq burned with shame and rage.
 They reached the western gate, which remained open during the day.
 Without ceremony, they were kicked through, both falling to the dirt and scraping their knees.
 “Get going,” one said.

He was actually rather relieved that he didn't have to read about her husband and children, but it seemed odd that the pages hadn't changed when she'd gone back.
 He snorted, shaking his head.
 What was really odd was that the pages had changed to begin with, that the information about her marriage had disappeared when she'd walked into 2011.
 And that, of course, had been the biggest oddity of all.
 Still, she had come 84 years into the future, and the parts about her husband and children had disappeared.
 He'd been sure that the pages had changed because her 84-year trip would affect the choices she was to make in 1927, so it made sense, now that she'd gone back to 1927, that those pages would change again to include the name of her husband or at least something about her adult life.
 Shaking his head, he put the papers back.
 He'd never know what had happened to her.

 If Alec really had arranged this incredible trip, literally overnight, he'd have her on a plane much faster than anyone else would've believed possible.
 "Mom, we've already gone through every single one of your objections, and they've all been taken care of.

 The only thing left to do is call them back and accept before they decide to offer it to someone else."
 It obviously hadn't crossed Mom's mind that they might decide to go with someone else.
 Waffling over whether or not to take the job was one thing when she was sure she'd have it in the end.
 It was entirely different when it might cost her the biggest break she'd ever had.

It took me several seconds to understand why Rachel's words seemed so odd.
 Ever since learning Alec's secret I'd assumed everyone here was a shape shifter.
 Only I hadn't ever felt the underlying hint of power and energy from her that I'd come to associate with Alec and the others.
 "Wait, you're not a shape shifter?
 How is that possible?"
 Rachel's expression as she tried to understand my question was so surprised it actually managed to lighten the mood.
 "Oh, I forget sometimes how much you don't know.
 I'm normal, and Mom's normal, but everyone else is a shape shifter.
 Human-shape shifter marriages almost never happen, but when they do the kids can go either way.

 Another defining moment for all of us.
 We hope and pray that Brandon will use the tools he has been taught to navigate through this world where drugs and alcohol are abundant and easy to obtain where ever you live and no matter who you are with.
 Brandon needs to have the strength and desire to embrace his new healthy body and see the ramifications of destroying himself and his family if he chooses to return to drugs.
 About the Author Bradley V. DeHaven is a Financial Planner in Sacramento, California, a husband, and a father of two sons, one of whom is a recovering Oxycontin addict.

Historically, the free market evolved over centuries in conditions of surplus production and stable currency, neither of which exist in Eastern Europe today.
 Efforts to accelerate the development of the market will have first of all to meet the political, legal, social and economic conditions historically required for its creation.
 And these conditions must be met simultaneously.
 4.Macro-economic stability is a precondition for increasing production: It is extremely difficult to increase production in a context of general macro-economic instability and hyperinflation.
 The rapidly falling value of local currencies minimized their utility as a medium of exchange.
 Agricultural as well as industrial enterprises seeking a stable medium in which to hold their wealth increasingly resorted to hoarding marketable, non-perishable commodities such as food grains or converting local currency into foreign money wherever possible.
 This was particularly devastating for agriculture, where higher production was desperately needed to meet consumer demand and reduce dependence on food imports.
 The breakdown of the local currency as an effective medium of exchange was accompanied by an unfavourable shift in the terms of trade between agriculture and industry, resulting from the near-monopolistic position both of the suppliers of farm inputs, especially fertilizers and farm machinery, and the processing units that purchased farm produce, such as dairies and meat processing plants.
 Together, these factors precipitated a rapid fall in farm production and food availability.
 There can be no solution to the food problem without first establishing a stable medium of exchange.

obal financial crisis: The global economic crisis is a major factor in reducing the supply of food92m.0m This is not the only factor, however. The global economic crisis is also contributing to the increasing shortage of food. In particular, the global economic crisis is causing the rise in the prices of food<sep><cls>

“Do you see anything?” he asked.
 Imeralda eyes opened wide when Doi’van fully opened the doors and revealed the room.
 It was in style identical to the first room of the Celestial Beasts except instead of great beasts on pedestals, it held crouching daemons in pits.
 The previous vague smell of brimstone and hellfire wafted fully into the room.
 Doi’van and Rodregas stepped into the room but paused when Imeralda did not follow.
 He looked back and she looked confused, squinting as if the room was not fully illuminated by the glowing daemons in their pits.
 “Can you not see into the room?” Rodregas asked.
 “No, I can see something, shapes flicking in fire?

Detailed recommendations are presented in the next section of this chapter.
 At the other end of the spectrum, comparable efforts must be made to raise scientific literacy, which is essential for the continued growth of technology, productivity and employment in modern society.
 The pervasive influence of science in society requires that we bridge the gap that presently divides the sciences and humanities and evolve an educational system in which science is no longer regarded as a specialized field of study.
 Fourth, radical changes are needed in the content of school curricula at all levels to make education relevant to the real needs of the students and the development of the country.
 The society whose system of education is integrated with the social aspirations of the country will develop most rapidly.
 The system of education prevalent in most developing countries is oriented toward the outer form – acquiring a degree or qualifying certificate – rather than the inner content of knowledge.
 Educated unemployment is a direct result of a system that fosters obedience and rote learning rather than individual initiative and creative thinking.
 A new system of development education needs to be introduced at all levels to equip the student with an understanding of his/her society, its achievements and potentials, and the opportunities open to each individual to participate in its future growth.
 The index of its success will be the extent to which students of this curriculum seek self-employment rather than salaried jobs.
 Fifth, minimum and average educational levels should be raised in all countries.

tional level is not an issue for most developing countries, a new system should be introduced at all levels92m to0m ensure that the student can gain the skills necessary to succeed in life. Third, an education system that is consistent with the needs of the country will increase the number of people in the workforce in<sep><cls>

 I suppose I’m an evangelical but I don’t like to confront people.
 Sometimes I feel ashamed that I haven't been the instigator of more conversions.

 Still, I'll offer few recollections for the consideration of real evangelists.
 During my years between conversion and earnest churchgoing, I often experienced campus evangelists, church pastors, elders, and other enthusiasts whom I sensed wanted to make me into a notch on their belt, and who have left me doubtful about the worth of salesmen’s tactics in the service of God.

After the Second World War, developing countries that had suffered from recurring famine in early periods struggled to increase food production as an urgent national priority to keep up with surging population growth and spiralling demand for food.
 India’s Green Revolution was spurred by the imminent threat of severe famine in the mid-1960s.
 China was compelled to produce more food by the loss of perhaps as many as 30 or 40 million lives to famine in the late 1950s.
 But the very motive which stimulated these achievements moderated them as well.
 For while these governments took concerted steps to meet the minimum needs of the population for food, they tended to overlook the equally great potential to utilize agriculture as an engine for economic growth and job creation.
 Once minimum food needs were met, attention was diverted to other sectors of the economy.
 Politically, the elimination of the famine threat arising from food shortages is one of the reasons for slower growth in agricultural productivity in recent years.
 This has resulted in a marked decline in investment by developing countries in government-sponsored agricultural research and rural techno-infrastructure.
 This tendency has been compounded by the false notion that in order to achieve economic growth, new jobs must be created in industry and services.

The new chapter was on probability, which had absolutely nothing to do with the stuff they'd been working on the week before.
 I quickly decided I didn't like the new stuff as much as what I'd been studying on my own, but it was relatively easy, and almost before I knew it class had ended and it was time to go to lunch.
 My doubts about whether or not everyone would be back in school today after three nights of partying were quickly resolved as Britney and I tried to fight through the ridiculous foot traffic on our way to our lockers.
 By the time we made it to the lunch room, I was heartily sick of dodging jocks with shoulders the size of an ox.
 Why on earth did every single one of them think it was necessary to mock fight, throw balls back and forth to each other, or otherwise make a spectacle of themselves?
 My mood was further soured as we arrived to find an unmistakable circle of bystanders signaling an impending fight.
 My first instinct was to go find a teacher before the two idiots hurt each other, but while I was still looking around to see if there was an adult in the room, Britney grabbed my arm and pulled me towards the circle.
 It wasn't until we got closer that I realized there was something wrong with the circle of kids surrounding the combatants.

Viewing the future demand for food from this perspective reveals a tremendous opportunity.
 Vast sections of humanity now aspire to the higher quantity, wider variety and greater nutritional content of food once consumed only by the wealthy.
 An effort to raise nutritional standards in the developing countries nearer to the levels prevalent among industrial countries will not only eradicate hunger, but also dramatically spur economic growth, employment, and purchasing power among the rural poor, stimulating growth of production and jobs in industry and services, as well as increasing exports and imports.
 Raising the entire world population to the level of the prosperous nations would require a 72 per cent increase in total world food production, measured in terms of calories.
 In order to meet the people’s nutritional requirements for fruit and vegetables, India’s production of these crops needs to double within the next decade.
 Achieving that high level will generate more than six million new jobs in the country.
 Broadening the scope to include other agricultural products, particularly textiles, the potential for accelerating global economic growth by an agriculture-led strategy is even greater.
 Cotton is a crop with a very high income and employment multiplier effect.
 Per capita cotton consumption in poorer developing countries such as India is less than half the level in China and less than a third the level in industrial nations.
 Measures of the gap between the prevailing levels of nutrition in developing countries and the levels achieved in the West reveal a huge potential for increasing demand for agricultural production, which can serve as an engine to drive the growth of the world economy.

supply in the developed countries would require a massive expansion of agricultural production in the developing countries92m.0m The current food supply in the developing countries is less than 1.4 billion tonnes, which is a huge increase from the present level. The current food production in the developing countries is more than 2.<sep><cls>

I was so nervous about answering her question that I didn't realize she was headed over to shut my window until she was already so close that there was no hope of intercepting her.
 Hopefully Alec had kept moving after he'd jumped.
 Otherwise Mom's questions were about to get a bit more pointed.
 "Mom, how could you think that?

The courageous pioneer and talented individual who achieve more for themselves always draw upon a rich social legacy and build on the ideas, knowledge, discoveries, inventions and innovations of countless people and societies who have come before.
 Policies should be formulated to reflect the contribution of the collective to all individual achievement.
 The main prerequisite and condition for the fulfilment of the world’s many different potentials is peace.
 As democracy supports peaceful relations between states, economic prosperity and fuller development of people, peace makes possible the development of stable political institutions, more productive economic activity and a more civilized and enlightened social life.
 Without establishing a stable climate of peace, human rights cannot be safeguarded, democratic institutions cannot function effectively, prosperity cannot flourish, and human beings cannot discover their higher capacities for external achievement and inner fulfilment.
 Peace is imperative for a thriving democracy.
 A comprehensive perspective and integrated approach to these inter-related issues can lead to a major breakthrough on multiple fronts.
 We are poised at what can become a turning point in the role of war in human affairs.
 The momentous consequences at stake call for decisive action.

“King Vaelor asked for aid and the elves declined,” Qurrah answered, chuckling.
 “The King’s pride will not take too kindly to that.”
 “He and his pride can suck a rotten egg,” Harruq said.
 “Hurry or we’ll miss the battle.”
 He pulled his brother down the alley to where a tall, crumbled house leaned near the wall.
 “Onto my shoulders,” Harruq suggested, grabbing Qurrah’s knees and hoisting him high.
 Qurrah latched onto the roof, paused, and then stepped onto Harruq’s shoulders.
 The extra height boosted his head and chest above the roof, allowing him to climb to the top despite a moment of flailing.
 Harruq clapped for him, and he smiled at the next roar from the orcs.

Alec seemed like the type who'd force a decision just because he could.

 It was stupid to have risked a panic attack when I was already borderline depressed, but that was what I was looking at now.

Prognosis for Employment in the Twenty-First Century
 Although it is difficult to make reliable employment projections based on past trends, we can say some things with a fair degree of certainty.
 In order to provide employment for every job seeker, the world needs to create approximately one billion new jobs during the next decade.
 This will require a job growth rate of more than 4 per cent per year compared to the less than 3 per cent achieved during the 1980s.
 About 95 per cent of the growth in the world labour force over the next 35 years will take place in developing countries.
 An additional 260 million people will enter the workforce during the 1990s.
 Employment in the East Asian economies is projected to grow by 37 per cent between 1990 and 2000, while the labour force will increase by only 17 per cent, leading to an increasing shortage of labour in the region.
 In contrast, employment growth is projected to lag behind labour force growth in South Asia, Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa.
 Although job growth has once again started in many OECD countries, economic growth alone will not be sufficient to bring down unemployment rates significantly, especially among youth and the long-term unemployed.
 Changes in values, attitudes, structures and policies will be necessary.

20-first century is the most challenging challenge facing the world. It is a challenging task that will be difficult to solve in a relatively short time. However, the challenge of achieving employment growth is not a simple one92m.0m It also includes the challenges of managing the economic growth of the developing world, such

According to a recent study, by 2040 China and India will be the first and third largest economies in the world.
 Together with Russia and Brazil, they could account for a larger portion of world GDP than today’s six largest industrialized nations.
 Population, which was perceived as a liability not long ago, now appears to be an asset.
 In reality, population, like nuclear energy and so many other things, is neutral.
 Its value depends on what we human beings make of it.
 Changing Demographic Profile of the West: Demographic studies indicate that steep declines in the growth of population in Europe, Japan and USA will create acute labour shortages and unprecedented long-term demand for migration of foreign workers or transplantation of work to developing countries.
 UN and other studies estimate that Europe would have to accept 150 million new immigrants over the next 25 years in order to maintain the present levels of working population and Japan would need to admit 600,000 immigrants annually for the next 50 years in order to maintain the size of its working population at the 1995 level.
 The US labour force is projected to stop growing by 2013.
 These findings support the view of the India Vision 2020 report that “This trend will further accelerate the outsourcing of production of goods and services to locations where infrastructure, ease of doing business, quality, costs and availability of labour are most attractive, which will be beneficial for many labour surplus countries like India.”

Already, 156 countries have signed the treaty, owing either to coercion or indifference, and the number is expected to increase to 170 out of 179 states by 1995.
 The acceptance of non-proliferation by these countries further delegitimizes the continued possession of nuclear weapons by any country.
 All of the treaty non-signatories can be persuaded to sign in exchange for annihilation of these weapons by those that now possess them.
 Under these circumstances, refusal to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty could be considered sufficient grounds for expulsion from UN membership.
 Without a universal ban, the efforts of the nuclear powers to stop proliferation lack moral authority.
 Arguments are often advanced that nuclear weapons cannot be ‘dis-invented’, and that the danger of a rogue state or terrorist group acquiring and threatening use of these weapons necessitates that the present nuclear powers retain them for such a contingency.
 With the massive conventional firepower already available, nuclear weapons are not needed for defence, even against a rogue state with nuclear capability, and they do not represent a credible defence against terrorism under any circumstances.
 How could nuclear weapons conceivably be used to retaliate against terrorism?
 Alternative solutions can be found to address these threats far more effectively.

 The big guy was embarrassed.
 Then he added, “I am afraid my people are not big readers, and, well, they saw me as half-monster and I never learned how to read.” The last words he added very slowly, but then quickly added, “But if you can teach me some basics from the oral techniques that Imeralda mentioned, I would like to learn some magic if I can.” Rodregas looked at Doi’van; there was something about his expression, a yearning.
 “Do you want to learn to read?” he asked.
 “What do you mean?” Doi’van asked, stepping away from the other two like he was uncomfortable.
 “Just what I said, would you like to learn to read?” Rodregas said in a carefully casual voice.
 Doi’van responded, “We don’t have time for me to learn to read.
 You should spend time practicing with these Grimoires.
 It makes no sense to teach me to read when we are likely to see battle too soon for it to be helpful.” Doi’van’s voice, which was always deep, seemed to have gone down several octaves, such that the earth almost seemed to vibrate.
 Somehow, while the conversation on magic Grimoires had been of interest to him, the idea of learning to read seemed to terrify him.

 Apparently, this Steve was known to carry a weapon and he was known to come up a little short on cash for drug deals and if the seller wasn’t willing to accept the lower amount, he might brandish his weapon.

She was also much more fragile than either Doi’van or Rodregas; a blow that would only stun the two of them would shatter her.

He comes from a strong blood line and rich family and feels he should already be a knight and not be forced to be in the tournament.” “So, why is Nordien in the tournament and not knighted?” Rodregas asked.
 “From what I can gather, Nordien is very friendly with the Immortalists, including the Ambassador Van’dret, and most people believe that he only wants to be knighted so that he can then leave the knighthood and join the Immortal Guard.” Rodregas nodded.
 That was not too surprising; since such ex-knights are usually made officers.
 Greater sigils were much more rare in the Guard than the knighthood, not to mention the officers of the Immortal Guard lived in much nicer style than the knighthood.
 “The Knight Commander might not be willing to stand up to the Immortalists, but he would be more than willing to skip over giving knighthood to someone who was planning to leave anyhow,” said Rodregas.

While that expansion is likely, economic growth alone will not be sufficient to provide opportunities for sustainable livelihood for all those who need it.
 Jobs or livelihood for all must be the bottom line of all development, technological and trade policies.
 It will be necessary for governments to elevate employment to the top of their policy agenda and dedicate themselves to the vital task of achieving full employment.
 The Right to Employment
 The Commission’s report called for urgent action to address the problem of rising unemployment and presented a comprehensive set of strategies designed to promote full employment in both developed and developing countries.
 The centre-piece of ICPF’s approach is the assertion that employment must be recognized as a fundamental human right, the economic equivalent of the right to vote.
 As the electoral franchise is the basis for the legitimacy and operation of democracy, access to gainful employment constitutes the economic franchise that lends legitimacy and functionality to a market economy.
 The right to employment must be constitutionally guaranteed to enable all citizens to exercise their fundamental right to food and health security and a share in national well-being.
 ICPF’s view called into question the blind faith in the wisdom of the unregulated market that was prevalent during the heady days of radical free-market economic doctrine following the collapse of the Soviet system.
 Critics claimed that achievement of full employment was impractical and therefore guaranteeing it was impossible.

War both between and within states has come to involve and affect all of society.
 Infrastructure and production facilities have become a principal target of military action.
 Food supplies are frequently the first major casualty and most lethal weapon.
 A single explosion can paralyze a major metropolis or contaminate an entire region with toxic material, dwarfing the devastation caused by the industrial accidents at Chernobyl and Bhopal.
 The disruption of trade resulting even from regional conflicts such as the Gulf War or the war in Bosnia, impacts not only on the economies of the belligerents, but also on neighbours, trading partners and global economic performance.
 Neither the victor nor the victim can any longer afford to resolve conflicts violently.
 Political states may still be able to survive wars, but developmental achievements can not.
 So long as the benefits of development are confined to one or a few sections of society, the costs of militarization and war may not prevent economic and social progress.
 But when the need is to fulfil the rising expectations of the masses by extending the benefits of development to the entire society – thus enabling the society as a whole to move to the next higher level of collective affluence and fulfilment – every social resource must be garnered and harnessed for this purpose.
 The colossal cost of armaments and the catastrophic destruction of war are incompatible with the achievement of prosperity for all.

 Over the next few weeks Rodregas, Doi’van and Imeralda fell into a regular routine.
 It quickly became clear that while Imeralda might not be a trained mage, she was far more knowledgeable than Doi’van or Rodregas in magic.
 So, while Rodregas often led the training in the morning, she led during the afternoon.
 Rodregas thought Doi’van was learning far more quickly than any of the squires that he had trained with as a teenager.
 Doi’van looked like a daemonic nightmare, and he clearly loved to test his strength in battle, but he was an amazingly quick learner both with the forms and with the books.
 Even though Doi’van could not read, Rodregas would read him some of the Grimoires, since they were the only books they had.
 His insights and questions were insightful, and Rodregas realized that Doi’van’s intellect was greater than his own.

We began our work with the conviction that, as Willy Brandt said, 'the problems created by men can be solved by men'.
 The ancient Indian scripture, Bhagavad Gita, expressed the same sentiment by stressing, 'Whatever man aspires to, that he can accomplish.'
 The achievement of food self-sufficiency by India in a period when famine threatened millions of lives through the power of political will and scientific action in a democratic society illustrates this truth.
 In spite of such uncommon opportunities for a better common present, during the last six years the world has been witness to an escalation of ethnic and mini-conflicts, growing intolerance of diversity, the spread of small arms, an increase in violence starting with violence to oneself through drug addiction and damage to the life support systems of land, water, flora, fauna and the atmosphere.
 In addition, the current pattern of economic and technological growth is leading to gross social inequity and rising joblessness.
 The rich-poor divide is widening both within and among nations.
 At the same time, the spread of knowledge and information, particularly through the electronic media, has led to an era of rising expectations.
 The economically and socially underprivileged sections of human society are now aware that their future is not a question of fate, but of political and technological choice.
 If they are not given access to the information superhighways and other technological highways to progress, a new form of social and economic apartheid will spread, which will be even more serious in its consequences to the future of human civilization than the skin-colour-based apartheid which has just ended.

The Information Age has given meaning and content to the concept of a global village.
 The threats associated with climate change and biodiversity loss also underline the fact that while humankind may be segregated by political frontiers, our fates are intertwined ecologically.
 Economically also, islands of prosperity cannot co-exist forever in the midst of oceans of poverty.
 Both unsustainable lifestyles and unacceptable poverty must become features of the past, if we are to curb the growing violence in the human heart.
 Ten years after presentation of our report, we remain convinced that universal health, harmony and happiness are still within our reach, if only we imbibe the eternal truth contained in the following message of Lord Krishna delivered on the battlefield of life called Kurukshetra:
 We human beings can become whatever we sincerely aspire to become.
 Looking back, it is astonishing how much the world has changed since the idea of establishing the International Commission on Peace and Food was first conceived in 1987. Who had the foresight to imagine the monumental changes which have so radically altered the political, economic and social complexion of the world community – the end of the nuclear arms race and the opposing military alliances of East and West, the rising tide of democracy that dramatically and irreversibly transformed the USSR and the countries of Eastern Europe, the growing importance of the UN in peace keeping and peace making, the peaceful end of apartheid in South Africa, the first tangible steps toward lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East, the completion of global trade negotiations and the founding of the World Trade Organization, and concerted actions to stem the degradation of the environment?
 The mid-1980s was a time when global military spending reached an all-time high of $1.2 trillion.
 Economic growth had slowed or stalled in much of the developing world, prompting some to term the 1980s the 'lost decade' for development.
 While there was little agreement on what steps were needed to reverse the arms race and provide a stable basis for world peace, a consensus was emerging that something must be done to address the urgent problems of hunger, famine and endemic poverty that continued to plague much of the developing world and constituted a gnawing source of instability that refused to be contained by national boundaries.

 is in a critical time to confront the growing challenges of hunger and endemic poverty, it is not enough to ignore the urgent needs of the world.<eop>92m<eod>0m In the past, I have written about a number of the challenges that face us today in the global environment. The most recent one is<sep><cls>

The immediate euphoria over the rapid reduction in tensions between East and West freed public attention to focus on other pressing problems and generated great expectations that a 'peace dividend' would usher in a period of rapid economic progress for developing countries.
 Yet, despite a remarkable one-third reduction in worldwide defence spending from peak levels in the 1980s, foreign aid budgets continued to shrink.
 This prompted us to examine the potential benefits that could be derived from transferring or redirecting scientific, technological, educational and productive resources from military applications to support development and the environment.
 At the same time, increasing pressure was mounted by donors on aid-dependent developing countries to reduce their own defence spending, often with out consideration for the genuine security concerns of these countries.
 The need to improve mechanisms to protect all nations from external aggression has stimulated a rethinking of the competitive security paradigm which has governed relations between nations throughout the century, and the formulation of an alternative approach.
 The slow expansion of world trade and economic growth in developing countries during this period, attributable to prolonged recession in industrialized nations and a drastic decline in demand from Eastern Europe, underlined the need for more effective and better-coordinated development strategies to address the problems of the world's one billion people who live in hunger and absolute poverty.
 Increasing the production and availability of food to meet the nutritional needs of a still rapidly expanding global population led us to propose steps to double food production in deficit regions.
 In many countries, the problem of hunger has less to do with insufficient food production than with distribution or entitlement.
 The poor lack remunerative employment opportunities to generate the purchasing power needed to obtain the minimum essential requirements of food.
 In 1990, the Commission undertook a study of alternative strategies to eradicate poverty among the 300 million extremely poor in India, representing about 25 per cent of the poor worldwide, by more extensive development of commercial agriculture and agro-based industries.

p agriculture and agro-based industries in the region, the Commission concluded that the development of commercial agriculture92m and0m agro-based industries would be effective in preventing starvation in this area. The findings of the study of alternative strategies for reducing poverty in the region were also welcomed by the international community.<sep><cls>

He handed Rachel a helmet but continued to look at us, at me, while she put it on.
 I was moving again, but my pulse sped up as Rachel grabbed a hold of her brother and swung her leg over the pillion seat on the bike.
 She seemed to see us for the first time as a cold chill arced down my back and the horizon started to vibrate.
 I managed to raise my hand in response to her wave, but it was an absent motion.
 My attention was still on Alec and his unwavering stare.
 Rachel leaned forward as if to say something to him, and he finally nodded and dropped the bike into gear.
 A few seconds later the pair was screaming out of the parking lot, and my breathing was too labored for it to be anything other than a full-blown panic attack.
 I made it another couple steps, just far enough to grab Britney as I started to fall.
 I had a split second to be grateful I'd lost all of that weight so Britney wouldn't collapse under me, and then the darkness claimed me.
 Even though I knew I wouldn't remember the void when I finally came to, I wanted nothing more than to just float in the darkness.

Real estate prices there were outrageous, but Rick, with his connections and eye for property, had gotten this parcel for next to nothing.
 It was only a few blocks from the downtown area and considered too close for comfort by true members of the upper class.
 But for Rick it was perfect.
 Both his office and his neighbors were close but not too close, and he had a beautiful lawn in the front and a large patio and flower garden in the back.
 Rick smiled as he walked into his kitchen, loosening his tie.
 Lauri moaned every time she walked into the garden.
 What a waste, she always sighed, looking at him with reproach.
 A woman would love having that garden, but what did a man know about flowers?
 Truthfully, he knew very little, Rick mused as he set his cartons of Chinese on the counter and went to change clothes.

I retrieved the leather pouch from the bed to examine the contents, but before I loosened the binding I heard a crash behind me; three council guards had busted open my door.
 I tucked the pouch under the long bell sleeve of the dress as they crossed the room to seize me by the arms.
 Chapter Five Trials
 I stood in the center of a council chamber I had never before seen.
 Vast libraries lined the walls, interspersed with decorated frames and ornate mirrors.
 A great vaulted ceiling rose overhead, embellished with intricate carvings, painted in every detail.
 Across the empty space before me was an elaborate table that seated six leaders of High Council.
 The guards who had brought me here were standing behind me, within arm’s reach on either side.
 Left of them were council members and, as I glanced right, Chevelle walked in to stand at attention, facing the council table.
 I could hear others enter behind us, presumably witnesses, and I wondered if Junnie was among them.

Rodregas knew things would start moving quickly now.
 Ravenhurr had been preparing the circles for months, feeding them with unearthly energies.
 Ravenhurr had not wanted the prisoners up on the tower roof until the last moment, lest their fear lead them to take desperate action.
 Ravenhurr started to speak the final words of the spell, setting off months of careful preparations.
 Rodregas knew that sorcerers use ancient languages so that others who might be watching cannot understand what they are saying and guess their intent beforehand.
 During the practice walk-through the week before, Ravenhurr had spoken the same words that he started to utter now.
 Ravenhurr’s deep, melodious voice rumbled out, “Spitualu seperatia orgirgia turia,” and the middle, pale green circle started to burn.
 Rodregas could not pronounce the ancient version of the Eastern Common language Ravenhurr was using, but he thought that he understood the gist of the meaning.
 Rodregas could not believe the man did not try to battle his way out.

It was impossible to say for certain how long I sat looking at the gentle motion of the tree branches, marveling at the way things made up of light could still cast shadows when silhouetted by the harsher light of the sun.
 Only somehow the sun had disappeared, replaced by the paler, colder light of the moon.
 The trees were still graceful strands of light, but the breeze had changed to a harsh thing, one carrying new scents that somehow represented danger.
 Something inside me forced my limbs into motion.
 I was running before the first howl tore through the night.
 I was moving unimaginably fast, jumping fallen trees and bounding over other obstacles which even my improved vision struggled to make out in time for me to avoid them.
 The speed of my passage wrung tears from my eyes, but I didn't dare slow.
 They were back there, four of them moving with speed only slightly less than my own, noses to the ground to follow my scent, save for the moments in which they let loose their unearthly howls.
 A flicker of motion up ahead should have made me pull up in fear, but the smell accompanying it was somehow familiar, somehow safe.
 I knew if I could reach the shadowy person I'd been unconsciously following, I'd be safe, but he was so incredibly fast and my pursuers were gaining.

We were halfway to the tutoring lab, and the halls were nearly empty.
 Everyone was always in such a hurry to get out, to go home, or to a party.
 Anywhere but here.
 "Oh, speaking of boys, I saw Brandon between fifth and sixth period.
 I made sure he knew I'd get you home after tutoring.
 He's so gorgeous.

She had the same dull blonde hair and muddy-brown eyes as me, though my eyes were specked with green.
 After a long evening ducking her verbal jabs and listening to her theories on the Council’s secret conspiracies, I finally made it to my room.
 A flick of my fingers and light flooded the tiny space.
 I took a quick inventory: the seal on my wardrobe was intact, my drawings were still scattered across the floor, and the stash of cheese remained on the table beside my bed.
 My mother’s pendant hung from a woven leather chain above my pillow, shooting refracted beams across the bed, and I smiled as I sat beneath it.
 Scanning the pages I’d brought home from the library, I tried to find some order.
 I hadn’t even considered there might be missing pages, but I sorted what I had as best I could onto the worn comforter.
 I sat rigid while reading through, unable to fathom why it had me so anxious.
 The first pages contained a detailed description of the writer, including his lineages and how he’d come upon the information.
 He was apparently a record-keeper for Grand Council and was responsible for copying scrolls and adding new information for each of the northern clans from their various local libraries.

 "But how?"
 The question just kind of popped out before I could think.
 It could've been taken as the worst kind of insensitivity; Mallory just gave my hand another squeeze.
 "He hasn't always been crippled.
 In fact he used to be a delightful dancer.
 His injuries were sustained at the hands of the individuals who killed Alec's father, the same ones who wanted to kill me, and who tortured Donovan for days before finally accepting that I'd died from the wounds that left me like this."
 Mallory shrugged, slowly and painfully in response to my questioning look.

I'd picked a seat that wasn't visible from the doorway, so I just put my head down and let the twin traumas run their course.
 By the time I was feeling steady enough to leave the classroom, I had just enough time to make it to the bathroom and try to clean myself up before lunch ended.
 The rest of the day went in starts and stutters.
 I went from answering a question about the economy of post-Civil War Georgia, to watching Alec start putting together rough plans for our next group project.
 I had just enough time to notice he seemed relieved I wasn't trying to get in his way, and then Spanish was finishing up and I was headed to the tutoring lab.
 Most Friday afternoon sessions were pretty sparsely attended.
 Today was no different, which was a good thing since I probably wouldn't have done a very good job of explaining anything.
 Mrs. Campbell shut everything down before my shift started, and sent me home with a concerned look in her eye.
 Rachel skipped over to my table while I was still trying to get my books put away.
 "Guess what.

He finally went out to the garden.
 She was way over by the pink roses, and he was surprised and dismayed to see her wearing her 1927 clothes.

 He ran over to her, but something about her stance when she looked up at him kept him from sweeping her into his arms like he wanted.
 "What are you doing?"

 She shrugged.

 The Tun brothers did not go straight home that night.

 “Why do we go this way?” Qurrah asked, his arm draped around his brother.
 His sagging body seemed ready to collapse into slumber at any time.
 “I need to retrieve the swords I dropped,” Harruq said quietly.
 “I want to train with them.”
 Qurrah nodded so absently that Harruq wondered if his brother even heard him.

Raise skills to increase productivity by vastly expanding the lower tiers of the agricultural, craft, technical and vocational training systems at the local level to provide practical training in job-related skills to the saturation point.
 Imbalances between supply and demand for skills exist at all levels in developing economies.
 Make a careful assessment of present supply and demand for key skills.
 Compare the density of different types and levels of skill in countries at the next higher stage of development and evolve programmes to raise the quantity and quality of skills to that level.
 4.Improve marketing: The organization of marketing is typically one of the weakest links and, therefore, one of the greatest barriers to economic growth and job growth.
 Brazil set up a distribution system for the export of citrus fruits that has enabled it to become the world's largest exporter of this commodity.
 Improve distribution and marketing systems, especially for agricultural produce, by identifying missing links and establishing successful model programmes that bridge the gap between rural producers and urban or overseas markets.
 5.Expand services: Actively encourage and support growth of the service sector through programmes similar to those utilized to support the expansion of small industry.

A distinguished-looking gentleman in his fifties was waiting for us as we screeched to a stop.
 His slightly disapproving frown hinted at decades of practice letting his 'bosses' know when they'd just crossed some kind of line, all the while never crossing any himself.
 The shape shifters all exited the car, most before it had even stopped moving, and then Jessica and Dominic both appeared as I made my comparatively slow way out of the vehicle.
 "...everyone's okay.
 I was somewhat worried about taking so much of our strength away.

 Alec turned towards the older man as I made my hesitant way over to the group.
 "Donovan, this is the young lady we hosted last night.

 Feeling even more awkward than normal, I stuck out my hand, only to feel my eyes widen as he gracefully took my hand in his own, and bent down to brush his lips across it.

 Far away, ash floated on a cold breeze, sucked into a forgotten cavern within a chasm feared by orcs and goblins.
 On the damp floor it fell, coalescing into a black muck, which stirred by unseen and unfelt winds.
 Here a bone poked up from the filth, there a fingernail.
 Floating above, transfixed in patient stasis, a soul awaiting a host, shone two crimson eyes.

“Your body heals fast and is a fascinating medium to work with.” A cloud went over his smile when he added, “Your body and spirit were not in very good alignment and your connection to the world was terribly fractured.
 Truly, it has been more effort to fix your spiritual wounds than your physical ones.” Jordaan’s smile returned when he added, “While true healing takes a lifetime of both inner and outer work, you are physically healthy enough to be on your way.
 And while I enjoy the challenge of working on your enhanced body, your presence too long among us will bring danger down to us.” Rodregas nodded, but asked, “And Doi’van, is he healthy enough to travel and fight if needed?” “He needs to let go of some of his anger and learn to focus on his inner self, but his physical wounds are healed.” Rodregas paused.
 He was not sure of all that Jordaan was saying.
 But he understood that they were healthy enough to go.
 So he then asked the question that he really wanted to ask, “Do you know if Imeralda is coming with us, or if she staying with you?” He should have asked her that himself during the last few days.

 Your collective endeavour illustrates the fact that no longer can global peace and security remain the preserve of political and military specialists.
 Without an adequate development effort, there can be no lasting peace and security.
 Conflicts over resources, ultra-nationalism exacerbated by the tensions of unemployment, poverty and despair at home will inevitably lead to resentment, and resentment turns only too easily into armed conflict.

 “Oh but you will care, half-ling.” The dwarf was now whispering and all the others had fallen silent so they could hear.
 “You will care because in the end, he will destroy you once he’s done using you.” My arms were still tense and my muscles whined in protest as I held my arrow back in full draw.
 “Use me to do what?” I spoke, using the same tone as him.
 The dwarf’s eyes were twinkling in happiness.
 He seemed happy to tell me the answer.

Once formulated, these conceptual models need to be applied under a variety of conditions to test their validity and demonstrate the value of a comprehensive approach to development.
 Therefore, we have proposed that the UN adopt a number of districts in different regions of the world, including crime-ridden inner cities or impoverished rural areas in industrial countries, to evolve and apply strategies for their rapid transition to a higher level of development.
 Six Goals in Education
 Once formulated, this knowledge needs to be imparted through education.
 Education is the greatest known civilizing force and the single most powerful lever for human development.
 Training imparts skills, but education increases the capacity of the individual at a more basic level, making the mind more active and alert, converting physical energy into mental energy, training us to see things from a wider perspective, to question and challenge the status quo, to think and imagine, to innovate and invent, to make decisions for ourselves and to act on our own initiative.
 Education is the process by which society passes on the accumulated knowledge and experience of countless centuries to new generations in a systematic, concentrated and abridged form, so that today’s young people can start their lives at the high point of knowledge and wisdom attained by preceding generations.
 Education replaces the slow, subconscious process of trial and error learning with a swift, conscious process.
 This accumulated knowledge is a great power that can be utilized to accelerate human development and abridge the time needed for society to arrive at progressively higher levels of material, social and psychological fulfilment.
 Despite the massive efforts of international institutions to create awareness of the vital role of education in peace, democracy, economic development, population control and environmental protection, progress on extending the benefits of education to all humankind is still grossly inadequate.

 Aurelia raced down the twisting back alleys of Celed.
 The dreaded chill of Velixar was far behind her, but still she hesitated to slow.
 Never before had she felt so vulnerable.
 As she stopped to catch her breath, a loud horn call echoed throughout the town.

I was only partly right.
 It took quite a while for me to go to sleep, but this time the culprit was the light outside my window.
 Chapter 14 For the first time in longer than I could remember, I woke up two minutes before my alarm went off.
 I was showered, dressed, and ready to go ten minutes before normal, but after pulling my books together, I just sat down on the sofa.
 Today was the day.
 I hadn't consciously planned it when I went to bed, but circumstances were perfect.
 If I was wrong, Mom was not only home, judging by the noises filtering down the stairs, she was awake and only a few minutes away from coming downstairs.
 Even filled with the near certainty that Brandon's parents, and by extension him, were our secret benefactors, the next fifteen minutes were some of the longest in my life.
 When Brandon's Mustang finally appeared around the bend in the lane, I found myself smiling so hard my face was starting to hurt.
 Breathing silent but heartfelt thanks that Mom was in the shower and therefore couldn't hear the low rumble of the Mustang's engine, I slipped out the front door and skipped down the concrete steps.

 “Easy there young man,” said the old Nymph.
 The Nymph slowly helped him up and held a bowl to his mouth.
 “My name is Durien and I am healer, please slowly drink this.
 Rinse your mouth out with it as your mouth is probably very dry after all this time.” The drink tasted like tea or maybe a light broth.
 As soon as Rodregas started to drink it, he realized he was starving.
 “I need more,” Rodregas croaked as he finished the bowl.
 The Nymph, an older man who unlike any Nymph Rodregas was familiar with, had his hair pulled back in a pony tail, nodded but said, “Slowly, too much right away is not good for you.” Rodregas nodded and cleared his throat; which was dry and felt like it had pebbles in it.
 While the bed was normal enough, the walls of the room were strange and seemed to be made of woven branches and some sort of hide or dark canvas pulled between tree branches to form an oval shape.

So, anyway, this beautiful woman followed me from city to city—she was a gypsy—and she dressed like a gypsy—I can’t tell you her name cuz you’d know it, man.
 Her heart is a legend.
 But, I didn’t know who she was until I was inside her and she was moving like God’s immaculate machine.

 And, I was, I thought, in love, for only the really second time in my life.

Her hand gripped mine with a fragile strength that hinted at the vibrant, powerful woman she'd been back then.
 Back before the years had worn at her.
 "The pack was huge back then.
 Much larger even than Brandon's is today, but all of that might didn't save Alec's father that night.
 There was a nightmare of blood and death, and when the sun finally touched the earth again the next morning, a full third of our number were dead, and most of those who remained were crippled.
 I would've been one of the former, except for Donovan."
 The questions continued to bubble up inside me, but I throttled them down, suppressing them rather than risking an interruption which might cause her to not finish.
 "At great risk to himself he carried me away from the site of the battle, running and swimming more miles than I care to think about.
 Eventually his strength finally gave way, and when he couldn't even crawl anymore, he found a cave and did his best to ensure I wouldn't die from exposure.

After those attempts failed, she gave us ten dollars and a shopping list.
 After we staggered through the aisles at the grocery store and delivered the bags to Evelyn, we drove up Mount Helix to the highest place in our town and paced around the big cross in the mountaintop park, staring all around at Mexico, the Pacific, and the Laguna Mountains.
 Every few minutes one of us would offer a reason why Eric couldn’t possibly die.

I mean to test his argument, because I’m stuck on the word “adore.” Here’s how it happened: in the midst of a period of personal, family, and professional turmoil, I picked up The Practice of the Presence of God, by Brother Lawrence, and discovered that simply reading about this fellow from long ago delivers some peace.
 Not perfect peace, but closer than before.
 Close enough so that friends find my apparent serenity in the midst of turmoil worth remarking about.
 Brother Lawrence was a layman who lived and worked, mostly in the kitchen, at a monastery in sixteenth century France.
 I thank God for the book by and about him.
 Still, it leaves me with nagging questions and a suspicion that I may have missed the point.
 In letters of encouragement and through the example of his life as described by admirers, Brother Lawrence proposed that the most blessed existence was to live in the awareness that God is always in our presence, and to act accordingly.
 Don't ignore him.
 Talk, listen, and worship him.
 Brother Lawrence’s attitude troubles me, because he persistently challenges his readers to follow his example, to live in, and for, daily, hourly, continuous communion with God.

Brandon told me that the Holy Grail for an Oxy dealer was to find an “old guy with a script” (prescription); so I decided this would be who I would become.
 I went to a Wal-Mart and purchased a pre-paid cellular phone that I would use as my undercover phone.
 I didn’t need my last name popping up on a caller I.D.
 I nicknamed the phone my “crack-berry.” After getting crucial information and doing a bit of research, I found the Craigslist classified advertisement with a picture of a young blond girl offering massages with a contact phone number that matched the drug dealer Steve’s number.
 The pictures in the ad were racy and the price per session was about twice the normal cost for such services.
 I called to set up a “massage.” I told her I got massages often for my ailing back but I thought it would be fun to get a massage from a pretty young lady.
 We scheduled an appointment for later that same day.
 I’ve had back problems in the past, as many 50 year olds do, so I dug up a back support and I wore it to the appointment.
 I had a basic plan and an obvious goal but how it would unfold was a mystery.

In the new political climate, reforms will be successful only in the measure that they are understood and accepted by the population.
 The vitality of the market depends on releasing the initiative of people to act in their own perceived best interests by producing and distributing goods and services for consumption by others.
 This initiative cannot be ordered, it can only be encouraged.
 Economic policy recommendations failed adequately to anticipate either the impact of the programme on the people or their reaction to it.
 In the early stages of reform, the public exhibited an incredible degree of patience, tolerance and endurance under conditions of growing hardship.
 Gradually public resentment and personal suffering (especially for the aged, children and new entrants to the work force) became so severe in some countries that no government could have sustained the programme without facing political upheaval or violent revolution.
 There is some truth in the argument that ‘shock therapy’ did not fail in Russia and other countries, because it was never actually implemented.
 At each crucial juncture either the central bank or the government pulled back from enforcing the necessary fiscal discipline.
 But it is equally true that ‘shock therapy’ never could have been implemented by a democratic government, when it imposed such enormous hardship on the people and generated a polarization and fragmentation of political forces within the country.
 Where similar strategies have succeeded in other parts of the world, it has usually been under authoritarian governments, such as in Chile.

It calls for a shift in thinking concerning agriculture from production for survival and subsistence to production for maximum and sustainable profit, from emphasis on meeting minimum needs to realizing maximum potentials, from commodity-based to resource-based planning.
 It seeks to tap the country's competitive advantage in labour-intensive agricultural crops and allied industries to double agricultural production - raising the annual growth rate to 4 per cent (versus 2.3 per cent in the 1980s) - achieve complete nutritional self-sufficiency, raise rural incomes and double India's total exports.
 Creating new jobs through this low-cost strategy can be accomplished entirely with the country's own resources, though foreign firms will find investment in India's agro-industrial sector very attractive.
 Initially, about half of the new jobs will be generated on farms by raising productivity through methods to improve management of micro-nutrients and water, expanding the total irrigated area by more complete utilization of the substantial additional capacity that has already been created, emphasis on more labour-intensive commercial crops such as sugar, cotton, fruit, flowers, and vegetables, sericulture, inland and coastal aquaculture, reclamation of wastelands for forestry and fodder, and increasing subsidiary incomes from animal husbandry and poultry.
 The expansion and intensification of cultivation of these products will raise agricultural output by $25 billion and generate approximately 45 million equivalent full-time unskilled and semi-skilled jobs in agriculture for unemployed and under-employed farmers and landless labour.
 The additional agricultural production will form raw material for expansion of rural industrialization and non-farm employment.
 Another 10 million jobs will be created in downstream agro-industries located in rural areas - in sugar mills, cotton and textile mills, processing units for fruit, fish and silk, and in marketing and distribution - thus serving as a counter-magnet to urban migration.
 Growth of agro-industry will stimulate demand for industrial machinery and services.
 The multiplier effect of skyrocketing rural demand will stimulate demand in a broad range of consumer industries and create an estimated 45 million rural and urban jobs in industry and services.
 Funding for the strategy would come from a mix of public sector and private sector investment.

A Small Farmer's Agri-Business Consortium, a specialized agency for implementation of the strategy, has been established by the government to coordinate implementation.
 In order to evolve a detailed methodology for implementation and to demonstrate the feasibility of the strategy model, district programmes are being organized in 12 districts around the country.
 A detailed study of Pune District in the State of Maharashtra has documented the potential for creating 750,000 jobs through this strategy.
 Extrapolation of these results suggests that the 100 million jobs that India needs to create and the 1 billion needed in the developing world are, indeed, achievable, provided that industrial countries adopt trade policies on agricultural products designed to enhance export opportunities for developing nations.
 International Agenda for Food Security
 The crucial importance of food security to world peace and economic development demands that the international community take collective responsibility and initiative to eradicate hunger and famine on a global basis as a complement to the initiatives of individual countries to deal with the problem domestically.
 The growth of food production in developing countries can be accelerated dramatically by the application of resource-based, location-specific strategies that incorporate a proper blending of traditional and frontier technologies and integrate all the links in the chain of production, processing, transport and distribution.
 Conditions vary too widely from country to country for detailed recommendations to be broadly applied.
 However, a number of strategies are relevant to the majority of developing countries.
 Some of the components of an Action Plan designed to achieve this goal are given below.

Ending the spell left him totally disoriented.
 His sight returned to normal, and it felt a little like falling from a very tall tree.
 As he retched on his knees, he looked about, discerning his location.
 He was beside the building the two elves were in, directly underneath their windows.
 He could see the tips of their arrows sticking out, glinting in torchlight.
 Two adjacent homes were already ablaze, their occupants still inside.
 Qurrah turned and grabbed the frame of the door.
 “Burn!” he shouted, loud enough for the elves to hear.

I closed my eyes and tried to ignore it but I couldn’t.
 I hated this feeling just as much as I hated puking, and the chills that liked to run up my spine at random times.
 Then all of a sudden, the dragon stopped.
 My eyes opened in horror as I saw the small trickle of blood fall from a hole in the right wing.
 Then we started to fall.

 I screamed so loud that my ears felt like they were going to pop.
 We plummeted to the ground, falling closer and closer… Oh man, I thought and closed my eyes.

 “This brings new meaning to ‘things can’t get any worse!’” I gripped furiously to the limp dragon.

But people did not question the order of the sorcerer and master of Raven Keep, so it should work.
 He dared not stay longer than he had to; Rodregas did not believe that he could fool Ravenhurr’s guards and servants for long.
 Ravenhurr was a powerful sorcerer who used magic quite casually; it would become quite obvious that Rodregas did not know how to use magic anywhere near Ravenhurr’s level.
 As soon as the keep emptied out for the birthday celebration he would make his escape.
 If he missed this opportunity he was not sure when he could try again.
 It was very rare for an Immortalist to leave his tower, and if he were behaving oddly, the guild would send someone to check on him soon.
 They were careful in their control of the kingdom.
 For a while Rodregas just leaned against the cold stone wall.
 Not thinking of anything, there was too much to think about to even start.
 So instead of thinking he simply felt the cool stone wall and it slowly, truly, hit him.

“Because we are.” “Do you think we should tell them about my vision?” I asked.
 He chewed his lip in frustration.
 “Maybe we should, but not include the parts about me.” “Seth,” I said slowly hoping he didn't get mad at me, “we should tell them what's going on with you eventually.
 What if Kojas comes for you and they have no clue why-” “No!” he said sharply, and the tone of his voice surprised me.
 “I can't Jazell, I wouldn't have told you if you hadn't ran after me demanding to know what I was hiding.” “But you're happy I did, right?” I asked.
 He looked away.
 “Yes I am.
 It's a lot better than hiding this on my own.
 The secret just keeps getting bigger.” I rolled my eyes.
 “Emily will find out eventually, and when she does, she'll kill you for keeping a secret from her.” “Let's hope it isn't until you and I figure this thing out.” I nodded and walked back into the cave.

It was easily eight feet tall, covered in thick fur, and had bloody claws as long as my hands tipping the ends of its fingers.
 My vision was still swimming enough that I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing.
 Even so, there was no way to ignore the bloodstained mouth as it got closer.
 I had a moment to realize I was still going to die all alone, and then the blackness came for me.

 Haunting eyes set above terrible fangs.
 Instead I found myself lying atop a gigantic bed in a room I didn't recognize.

 It took several minutes before all of the other relatively inconsequential details started filtering in.

I swam around in these impressions for what seemed like an eternity.
 Eventually, they became so familiar they all started to seem like my dreams, not someone else’s.
 Then the dreams stopped.
 No images flickered behind my lids, yet my eyes did not open.
 The muffle in my ears from the drowning dreams was gone.
 I could hear clearly, clearer than I’d ever heard.
 I hadn’t found my body yet, but I heard conversations, voices I knew.
 They were whispers but they were clear.
 I listened, hoping to gain clarity… but something was still wrong.

Part of me kept expecting Brandon to come running towards me from the direction of the party.
 He'd apologize, and explain how he'd wanted to stop Cassie, but he'd been too stunned by what she was doing.
 Even the delusional part of my brain that was trying to come up with a way to be rescued couldn't create a plausible scenario from there on.
 The look he'd given me at the end hadn't been that kind of shocked gaze.
 Cassie's threat was too vivid.
 Instead of curling up on the ground where I'd fallen, I pulled myself back up and continued to stumble along in the direction I thought would eventually get me back to the road.
 The washed-out landscape mocked me as I realized just how alone I was.
 Rachel didn't like me anymore, she'd never forgive me.
 I'd managed to alienate everyone from Alec's group, and now Brandon had tossed me aside like so much trash.
 It was too much.

But I do have one other Black Yew bow and a bigger sword that probably makes more sense for you to use than me, since I have used nothing but short swords for a very long time.” Rodregas then pulled out the two-handed great sword that he had found at the keep and handed it to Doi’van.
 On Doi’van it was more a hand and a half sword, but as he flourished it around a bit, Rodregas could see he was pleased.
 “The steel is simple, but the balance is good.
 I am starting to be very happy that I helped pull this wagon up the hill,” he said with a deep chuckle, which sounded like distant thunder.
 Rodregas nodded and said, “I am afraid other than a few items to sell everything else is food and blankets for us... and the horses and tools that I stripped out of the Raven Keep.
 I figured I would need the tools to fix this place up and make it livable.” Rodregas continued, “It is dark and late.
 Let’s make camp in here.
 In the morning we can start seeing about getting this farm in order.” With that they all worked together to get the barn organized and clean.
 There was no more talking, each had plenty of their own thoughts to mull over.
 Rodregas was feeling pretty good at the moment, dangerously positive.

But what I had read so far was much more horrifying than I’d expected.
 I didn’t want to continue.
 How could I have been so stupid as to forget it was my mother who had destroyed the northern clans, taken the families from everyone I knew?
 As they stood protecting me, the betrayal I’d felt before was gone.
 In its place was a new hurt, a heart-rending sorrow.
 They heard my sobs.
 I was aware of their eyes on me before they uncomfortably turned away again.
 Chevelle approached me warily as I lay curled in a ball on my blankets, the book positioned in front of me.
 He tossed it aside but I no longer cared.
 He sat behind me and pulled me into his arms, holding me as I wept.

"This fight between Alec and Brandon, it's for real?
 I mean they aren't just going to fight until first blood, are they?"
 Isaac's nod was hesitant, like he knew I was headed towards things he wasn't supposed to tell me.
 "I'm afraid the contest is quite serious, but still nothing for you to worry about."
 That didn't add up in the slightest.
 "I don't believe you.
 At least not the part about it not being anything to worry about.
 You all wouldn't have been so worried about Alec bringing me home Friday night if this was all no big deal.
 None of you have argued with Alec about anything since then, but Friday night James, Jasmin and Jessica were all ready to rip my head off over his express orders."
 The nod I received this time was even slower than the first.

He isn't like Alec, who notices everyone but is too good to actually speak to any of us.

 Britney slammed her book.
 "First Brandon decides he has the hots for you, and then you crack the ivory tower.
 There's absolutely no justice in the world."
 I so wasn't looking forward to the ride home.
 Past experience had pretty much established that when Britney got like this there was no reasoning with her.
 Trying to explain that she hadn't seen the look from my end, that Isaac most definitely hadn't been attracted to me, would be useless.
 I was pleasantly surprised when Britney's annoyance seemed to have blown over by the time we left the building.

Even I knew it was wasted effort.
 If Mom somehow beat the odds, it still wasn't going to result in the kind of money we'd need to save our house.
 Not in the next two or three weeks at least.
 It felt like my whole world had just disappeared down a drain.
 I didn't suffer any real panic attacks, but more or less spent both days in a kind of despondency that wasn't much better than a full-blown attack.
 By the time Monday morning arrived I had vague memories of doing homework and not much else.
 The only positive from the whole weekend was the way my dream from Friday stayed with me.
 As I got ready for school I idly wondered if it would be possible to recreate the grotto in real life.
 Obviously not with the impossible, glowing water, but with the incredible, lush vegetation and the secluded pool.
 Then again, I'd seen Mom pull off some pretty crazy tricks with her camera, maybe there would be some way to simulate glowing water, some kind of photography trick I'd never heard of.

The fight had been brief and bloody.
 None of our guys had escaped unharmed, but they were all going to make a full recovery, and the same couldn't be said for Cassie or the others.
 I shivered a little at the thought, and Alec looked up with concern on his face.
 "Do you need another blanket?"
 "No, I'm fine, just a little worried about Jasmin and the boys."
 Now he did frown.
 He wasn't excited that he had to stay here instead of leading the tracking group.
 I personally was glad he couldn't go along, and not just because it was dangerous work.
 I wasn't positive he'd really come to terms with having killed Brandon.

“We'll be fine.” “Emily's right,” Seth said.
 “We don't need him.
 If he doesn't want to help us then it's his fault if we don't get where we need to go.” “We should find somewhere to stay for the night,” Jason suggested.
 Seth nodded and we followed him deeper into the dark woods.
 I walked beside Emily as the trees passed us.
 Things seemed to watch us from the shadows and I felt like some poor little kid who was afraid to be a victim of a Halloween “jump-out-of-the-bush” scare trick.
 I shivered in silent fear.
 Emily studied me, “Are you cold?
 Do you need to get warmed up?” A little flame of fire flickered to life in her palm.
 I gave a shaky laugh.

When I confronted him, he denied it, and even went so far as to blame Brandon and Bryce.
 He threw his nephews under the bus to cover his ass.
 Another rift between us.
 I had to protect my boys.
 In their teenage years, Brandon and Bryce were as different as perfect strangers and they were becoming young men.
 As they began to become more independent from me and from each other, they became interested in different things.
 I tried to accommodate them as individuals and stay close to them.
 I tried my damndest to embrace each son and his hobbies and desires equally.
 Bryce began to love golf, so we played golf often and eventually joined a country club so he could play as often as he liked.
 In the summer, he would spend entire days at the club, soon becoming a great golfer and playing four years on his high school team.

The best I could really have expected out of the experience would have been to stay on an even keel, but instead it was almost as if part of my frustration evaporated.
 I still wasn't ready to get up and sing any songs, but it was starting to at least look like I might manage to finish out the day.
 Especially surprising considering my current mental state, it only took me half an hour to finish up the two Algebra sections I'd assigned myself.

“Don’t you care that he did something so stupid?” asked Imeralda.
 “Well,” Doi’van replied slowly, “the cats are obviously connected to him due to his Celestial lion essence.
 He freed them and now he has found a rich place for them to rear their young if they are pregnant from the mating.
 But with beasts like that, you are either in charge or you are game.
 I think that he probably did the right thing.
 No way to know for sure, but they did not rip him apart, so we will say he was very brave and not very stupid.” Then he added, “Of course, if you had asked me before hand, I would have said that taking food from a Dire Cat was a very stupid idea.” He finished with a smile full of sharp teeth almost a match for the lions and in a casual movement lowered his horned head in what Rodregas thought might be his equivalent of a shrug.
 The next morning they repeated the Morning Prayer and meditation ritual.
 This time while Doi’van joined in, Imeralda mostly watched.
 Afterwards Rodregas said to both, “I have been thinking that we are probably going to be here a few weeks while I finish healing up from the knife wound.

He had been waiting outside the town, and in the starlight the swathe of darkness rolling across the land had caught his eye.
 He had followed and from a distance observed the short meeting.
 His eyes flipped between the half-orcs and their master.
 His heart was torn.
 He had already warned Harruq that he would tolerate no strange behavior, yet he had given a similar warning to the man with the ever-changing face.
 “I do this for you, Aurelia,” he said, his decision made.

 Velixar had not moved since the brothers’ departure, his hands resting on the grass, palms upward.

 Marie and Davis had dinner alone at the Locke-Ober Café, Boston's most exclusive restaurant, and then he took her dancing at a private club where she'd never been.
 It overlooked the Charles River, and when they left the club, they strolled along the river.
 It was a warm, clear April evening, a night right out of a romance novel.
 "Thank you, Davis," Marie said, squeezing his arm.
 "For what?"
 "For this evening.
 It's been perfect."

The shake was definitely there, and getting more pronounced.
 "I'll order Donovan to keep you here."
 "You can try.
 He may even do it, but I don't think so.
 He's far too much the gentleman to keep a lady captive against her will.
 Even if he does, do you really think he can watch over me every second?"
 With a sharp tearing sound, Alec's right hand elongated into the viciously clawed weapon of his hybrid form.
 It shredded the comforter and mattress just a few inches from my head.
 I gave him my best lop-sided smile and kissed his arm.

I argued with that impulsive part of me the entire way to town.
 I shouldn’t do it.
 I couldn’t.
 But I was.
 I was going to do it.
 And if I got caught?
 I could claim ignorance.
 The entire clan thought I was an imbecile in any case.
 Maybe I would just see how close I could get.
 Maybe just to try… And then I was there, standing in front of the Council building and walking in.

The bandage alone should have told me I hadn't been hallucinating, but the fragments of memory didn't coalesce until I saw his eyes.
 The amazing, pale blue eyes were the final, poetic piece of evidence threatening to shred my sanity.
 I'd never really liked Alec, but I never suspected he was an actual monster.
 It was too much to process so quickly.
 When Alec took a careful step towards me, all I could think of was that I'd just seen those same eyes hovering above bloodstained fangs.
 I shrank back away from him, and saw his face go from calm to expressionless in a barely detectable flicker.
 I'd opened my mouth, maybe to apologize, or possibly to scream for help, but it snapped shut at Alec's response.
 Moving faster than I would have believed possible, he spun around and fled through the door.
 Between one heartbeat and the next he disappeared into the darkness, letting the door slam shut with enough force that the glass in the ceiling should have come down in a rain of razor-edged shards.
 The flowers closest to me swayed slightly from the force of the vibrations, pulling my gaze towards them.

Their size was about that of an elf, but all were different.
 The men were thicker.
 Not necessarily with muscle, some more bulbous.
 The women were varied as well, some thin and wiry, some stout like the males.
 Their hair was in all shades—light blond like the sun, brown as the trees, one even had rusty red, his plump cheeks peppered with light brown spots.
 And there were so many children!
 They were loud and ran round the camp all afternoon.
 And they were just as varied as the adults.
 I examined their wide noses, rounded ears, and stubby fingers.
 Those who wore no shoes had short, thick toes like trolls.

"I take it you'd be up for a brief field trip then?"
 My ears must have perked up.
 For all that we'd spent an incredible amount of time together over the last little bit, he hadn't taken me anywhere.
 "A field trip sounds great.
 Except I have to be back at least three hours before the dance, or Rachel and Jasmin will eat me.
 At least that's what they said, and I tend to believe them."
 Alec crossed over to me and ran a finger down the side of my face.
 "Only you could manage to make a joke out of having fallen in with monsters."
 I shrugged.
 "What else is a girl to do?"

“And what elf would that be?” asked a familiar voice from behind.
 Harruq whirled, his heart jumping as Aurelia stepped out from behind a tree.
 To his eyes, she was even more beautiful in the streaming daylight.
 Long auburn hair trailed past her shoulders, curled, and ended in several thin braids.
 Her face and eyes were small, the curve of her bones soft and elegant.
 She had small lips locked in a frown as she stood cross-armed, as if waiting on him.
 Her ears, upturned at the peak, were tiny even for her race.
 She wore a long green dress bound by a golden sash.
 “Well?
 Who sent you here?” she asked.

She frowned at the blond for a moment and then gasped.
 "He's on that lawyer show we watch!"
 She stared, and Rick smiled at her awe.
 She didn't turn back around until the actor was gone.
 Looking at Rick with wide eyes, she said, "You told me we probably wouldn't see any movie stars."
 "We were lucky."
 "Maybe we'll be lucky again!"
 And they were--that very night.
 They went dancing, and in the middle of the floor was a young actor from one of the newer shows.
 He was the center of attention, making all sorts of wacky dance moves.

 "You have to have a license to drive?"
 "Yeah--it's illegal to drive without one."
 "How do you get one?"
 "You have to study the rules and pass a written test, and then they take you out on the road and see how you drive."
 "When can I do it?"
 She couldn't wait to get her hands on the steering wheel.
 "Like I said, I'll let you drive in a parking lot tomorrow.
 I'll pick up a booklet for you to study one day this week."

His opponent, a young elf whose swordplay was raw compared to most of his brethren, tried to give him no reprieve.
 The guard captain didn’t falter in the slightest.
 “You sacrifice planning and thought for sheer speed and reflexes,” he said, his breathing steady and practiced.
 He assumed the elf spoke the human tongue, and the sudden killing lunge proved him correct.
 Antonil pulled his head back, the point stopping just shy of drawing blood.
 An upward cut took the blade from the elf’s hand.
 Antonil’s sword looped around, thrust forward, and buried deep inside flesh.
 The elf fell, gasping for air from the fatal wound.
 Blood pooled below him.
 Antonil pulled his sword free and saluted him with the blade.

He just remained sitting there.
 “What should I do?” A sly grin crossed his face and he rolled his hand out in front of him.
 “You are only limited by your imagination, Freya.” Great, so if I screwed up it was just a problem with my mind.
 I considered that, recalling what Steed had said about feeling it, thinking about what you wanted to happen.
 But what did I want to happen?
 I had to catch that line of thought before it spiraled out of control; I concentrated on finding something small.
 A tiny pebble lay on the ground at my feet.
 I focused on it hard, willing it to rise.
 When nothing happened I looked for Chevelle’s reaction.
 He watched me, his serene mask back in place.

I finished up the day's homework, and made it more than halfway through one of my makeup assignments by the time Mrs. Campbell stopped off at my desk.
 "Care to run another errand for me, Adriana?"
 I didn't really want to.
 Not when I'd just discovered I had more studying to do than was humanly possible.
 Still, Mrs. Campbell had always been super nice, if equally stern, and there was only ten more minutes of class left.
 Besides, I'd been so intrigued by the sight of Alec drawing that I wanted to see him like that again.
 If he could take such joy in the creation process, maybe he wasn't as bad as he seemed.
 The only way to know for sure was to see him with all of the masks off again.
 "Sure, I'd love to.

"This is highly irregular, Mr. Graves.
 In fact I don't believe the administration can legitimately expect me to comply."
 Alec's smile could have been used to sweeten pretty much any beverage you could imagine.
 "I promise not to get in the way.
 In fact if you could just find us a couple of desks in the back corner you'll hardly know we're here."
 The look she shot me was so venomous for a second I thought my heart was going to stop.
 "Ms. Paige has an assigned seat towards the front of the class.
 Based on her scholastic performance to date it would be highly irresponsible of me as an educator to allow her to change seats."
 I was just far enough off to the side to watch as Alec's eyes very slowly and pointedly drifted down to stare at the note in her hands.
 For a second I wasn't sure she'd gotten the hint, but then those same hands clenched reflexively, nearly tearing the note before she caught herself and smoothed it back out.

A bunch of dwarves and tall, muscular men crowded around something.
 The men had double swords sheathed on their back, long ears, and long black hair.
 They were wearing some type of combat boots and thick coats.
 One of them moved and I saw a tied dragon staked to the ground.
 It continued to try to stand but it seemed to weak and fell back down.
 I heard Emily gasp in horror and I felt the same way.
 One of the men poked it in the side with the butt of his sword and the dragon grunted in pain.

The horns were curled into his black bushy hair which was long, very thick, and very wild.
 It was sticking out in weird ways from his head.
 All the guards had been confused as to why Ravenhurr had kept him, as it was against the Guild rules to use any of the Hellborn in the ceremony.
 The Immortalist was trying to become Celestial not a member of the Infernal realms.
 It was a very stringent rule that everyone knew not to break, not that any of the guards was going to mention it to the Guild.
 “Who are you?” asked the man that Rodregas had tagged as ‘the leader.’ “I am not sure who I am,” Rodregas responded.
 “And I think I will keep any answers that I figure out to myself for now.” “You are not Gerald though are you?” asked the AElf maiden.
 “Not to ask a dumb question,” Rodregas asked in a curious tone “but who is Gerald?”  Silence followed his query but finally he got an answer.
 “He is the man that you appear to be, whose body you now… have,” responded the maiden.

I'd half thought Cassie was going to rip out my throat.
 I walked past a pair of gorgeous, gold-fringed drapes, handed my ticket to a distinguished-looking man in a uniform, and then smiled as he pointed me towards my door.
 It was almost a relief to be around strangers again.
 He'd been polite, but hadn't tried to fawn over me.
 My being asked out had changed my treatment from almost every girl at school.
 Half the student body, the more sensible portion it seemed, had all decided that I was some kind of massively stuck-up slut.
 The other half had decided they needed to be my new best friend if they wanted to get invited to any of the cool parties ever again.
 It might not have bothered me except the girls who now hated me were the ones I generally would've gotten along with, at least as much as I ever got along with anyone.
 My leaving Brandon's insane bouquet of flowers at the office instead of lugging it around all day should have helped.

I had forgotten, lost for so long in my dreams, the bonds I’d hoped would break, the councilmen we’d need to free me.
 I wished I could think clearly.
 I tried to remember what had happened, but could only see flames.
 A flicker of movement caught my eye and I turned to find a hawk perched on the ledge of a balcony.
 Suddenly, I needed fresh air more than anything.
 Chevelle helped me to my feet and I walked, a little wobbly, to the door.
 I had been dressed in a vest of dark leather and slim pants, carved medallions adorning my chest, but my feet were bare as they crossed the polished stone floor of the bedroom, at ease in a place they seemed to know.
 I stepped out into the sun, and I had to steady myself on the stone ledge.
 Not because of the lightheadedness, though I was feeling faint, but because below me, before the steps to what I now realized was a castle, a thousand elves watched me.
 I sucked in a harsh breath, unable to get my mind to accept what I knew was happening.

 Steed and Chevelle broke their stare, turning to the noise—dogs, I thought—before the entire world shifted into action.
 Ruby was gone, vanished from beside me, and I was whisked from my seat, catching only a glimpse of Steed and Chevelle darting past.
 In less than a heartbeat, I was standing over the rocks in the opposite direction, Ruby before me, red curls blocking my view, arms outstretched in readiness.
 Steed and Chevelle were at opposite angles in front of us, both tensed, even more so than they had been in their bout.
 I peered around Ruby’s mane to see what they were focused on.
 In front of our triangle, directly ahead of Ruby, stood a reedy, blond elf, draped in the long white robe and tassels of council.
 I felt sickened as I absorbed the idea that a council member—is he a tracker?—had been behind me as we were all engrossed in a trivial match.

 When I told him no, he--they--threw me out and told me to find my own way home."
 It was harder to relate the story than I'd expected, but Mallory's cluck of disapproval over Brandon's actions helped a little.

 As the limo drives from location to location for this funeral-a-thon, my little brother Harry is watching a helicopter above us.
 At first, it is a welcome distraction, but the chopper keeps showing up.
 We see it through the limo’s glass sunroof, then notice it when we are getting in and out of limo.
 The longer this goes on it becomes an obsession for all of us (except Grandpa who is likely about to overdose on little white pills which have the name of an explosive!)
 At the gravesite ceremony, thank goodness, that frickin’ helicopter we have all been obsessing about is not anywhere to be seen.
 Our limo pulls up followed by a stream of limos and cars.

Rodregas simply sagged as the truth behind the half AElf’s words sank in.

 Finally Rodregas turned to Jordaan and said, “Imeralda is right and I apologize for our anger.
 It is misplaced.
 My life and the life of my friend are well worth the price and we are in your debt.” At Rodregas’ words Jordaan simply nodded and then stepped into the trees, disappearing as the Nymphs had a habit of doing when in nature.

 That was nearly a deal breaker, I could see it by the way his initial smile at my 'rolled eyes' faded away into his more characteristic seriousness.
 He contemplated his response for a good fifteen seconds, which was probably something like two hours in shape shifter time, before finally touching his pen to the paper again and then passing my notebook back.

he finally asked me to write my question. He said I should ask him some of his questions and then ask him his answers.<eop> He didn't say a word. I couldn't tell what was going on. He just stared at me. He didn92m'0mt speak a<sep><cls>

Only seven managed to keep ahead of his berserking madness: a mother, her two children, a few farmers, and their daughters.
 They dared to hope.
 As they ran, a strange sight met their eyes.
 In the distance were hundreds of bodies lined in perfect formation.
 They held no torches or lanterns.
 The wind shifted, and upon its gentle flow the stench of death came to them.
 The villagers slowed, fearfully eyeing the line.
 The stars were bright, and there was no mistaking that something was amiss.
 They were no soldiers.
 Only a scattered few wore armor.

“You need to be as well.”
 “What are you…‌awww, damn it.”
 He sat up straight and shook his head, trying to clear the fuzz that clogged the vast empty space between his ears.
 Qurrah helped by offering a third kick, this one right to the kidney.
 Harruq gasped and staggered to his feet.
 He was outside their little home in seconds, urinating on the grass.
 “Hadn’t pissed yet,” Harruq shouted to his brother.
 “You could be a bit kinder, you know.”
 “At least you’re awake,” Qurrah said back.

“Don’t hurt me,” he shouted.
 His face poked around the tree, his long brown hair falling down past his eyes.
 Much as she tried not to, Aurelia burst into laughter.
 “Get over here,” she said.
 A small silver dagger appeared in her hands.
 Harruq eyed it warily.
 “What’s that for?” he asked.
 “When was the last time you cut your hair?” Aurelia asked.
 The half-orc shrugged, for some reason embarrassed.
 “I don’t know.

Brandon chuckled as he threw the Mustang into reverse and sped out of the lane faster than normal.
 The stereo clicked over to another song as we flipped around and headed back into town.
 It was more of the thrumming beats I'd come to associate with Brandon.
 "I thought this place was in one of the parks or something.
 Why are we headed back to town?"
 "Wow, you really are a city girl.
 In order to get far enough not to be busted by the cops we have to go really remote.
 There isn't any way my car would make it where we need to go.
 We're headed to Vincent's to hitch a ride in his truck."
 'Truck' turned out to be an understatement.

Isaac, James and Jasmin were trying to track down the worst of the lot, the ones who'd taken an active part in Brandon's atrocities, but it was slow going.
 Part of the job had been resolved when Cassie and two other wolves had tried to circle around and attack the estate.
 Luckily Isaac and the others had stumbled onto them.
 The fight had been brief and bloody.
 None of our guys had escaped unharmed, but they were all going to make a full recovery, and the same couldn't be said for Cassie or the others.
 I shivered a little at the thought, and Alec looked up with concern on his face.
 "Do you need another blanket?"
 "No, I'm fine, just a little worried about Jasmin and the boys."
 Now he did frown.
 He wasn't excited that he had to stay here instead of leading the tracking group.

I couldn't possibly be the gorgeous figure he'd brought to life on his canvas.
 I opened my mouth to protest, and then the expression on her face finally registered for me.
 Compassion.
 Acceptance of the viewer, combined with an obvious desire to mend grievous hurts.
 It was exactly how I remembered feeling.
 My questing eyes finally found the last, missing piece.
 There was the gratitude.
 Misplaced on her perfect face.
 Wrong on the features of someone who couldn't possibly need help from a mere mortal, but still there.
 "It's so beautiful.

The half-orc shrugged.
 “Sure, why not?”
 Instead of starting, she lowered her staff and crossed her arms.
 “Something’s wrong, Harruq.
 Tell me what bothers you so?”
 Harruq sighed and looked away.
 He gently tapped his swords together.
 “I don’t know.
 Bored.”

That your warmth and tenderness and thoughtfulness have made me dissatisfied with the man I'm supposed to marry.
 That I feel more comfortable with you than I could ever hope to feel with Davis.
 Rick watched the emotions play across her face.
 "What isn't my fault?"
 he repeated, his forefinger tracing a path along her throat up to her chin.
 She swallowed.
 "That-that I can't go through with it."
 His finger froze.
 "I'm sorry--I should never have pushed you.
 I know that you're engaged, and I know--" "But that's it.

I started to get irritated but then the feather was in my other hand and he was back, his hands now empty.
 And then, for no apparent reason but amusement, he did a few somersaults and landed in the center of the circle, smiling.
 I could only shake my head as Ruby clapped beside me, clearly thrilled with the show.
 I thought I must have missed something.
 Grey bowed out of the circle and was replaced by the two tall, silvery elves.
 I found myself startled again; I had not seen them sitting with the group, or anywhere else.
 For some reason, it was much more eerie than the little wiry man who blinked in and out of vision.
 One of the men spoke, his tone formal.
 “We will not demonstrate their full power at this time, in fear of shorting our forces a man for mere display.” I assumed he was probably joking.
 “As you can see, they can be frightening, however, without attack.” At that, the dogs walked into the circle.

“Odd girl,” Qurrah whispered.
 Harruq forced a laugh.
 To Qurrah’s eyes, he looked exhausted, and the shrinking of his muscles was glaring.
 “I’m sorry I left you there at Woodhaven,” Harruq said.
 “And I’m sorry you were alone when Velixar died.
 How did it happen?”
 “Elves came and attacked.
 No apologies are necessary, Harruq.
 All is forgiven.”
 “No, it’s not all forgiven,” he said, grabbing his brother’s shoulders.

 Harruq was in his bed, and the door was open. “I am sorry my brother died,” he said.92m<eop>0m “I am sorry I didn’t go with them. I am sorry the elves attacked us. I am sorry the elves took our weapons from us.<sep><cls>

“My brother can be a mindless butcher, but he must be angered or spurned into battle.
 When peaceful, his mind entertains ideas that run…‌ contrary to what he and I are.”
 “And what is that, Qurrah?
 What are you and your brother?”
 The fire sparked a shower of orange into the sky as Qurrah spoke.
 “Superior.”
 In the distance, elven eyes watched that cough of flame stretch to the stars, as well as the sight of those two huddled figures talking long through the night.
